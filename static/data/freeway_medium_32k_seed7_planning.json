        "thinking": "<think>We are given the initial player position at (0,0) at turn t1 = 0, and we need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the y-direction, and must remain within y in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, and k from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T, and then at turn T+1, on freeway y_{T+1}. So, when moving, the player is only subject to the cars on the current freeway at the current turn.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=0. For each freeway (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the car's head is at the right end and tail at the left. The span at turn 0 is [tail, head] and then at turn T, it becomes [tail + s*T, head + s*T] (because moving right increases the positions).\n- For a left-moving car: the car's head is at the left end and tail at the right. The span at turn 0 is [head, tail] and then at turn T, it becomes [head - s*T, tail - s*T] (moving left decreases positions).\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Actually, the direction is given as \"right\". So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nTherefore, for a car (h, t, d, s) at turn 0 (t1=0) and for a future turn T (relative to t1=0, so absolute turn T), the span of a right-moving car is:\n  [t + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nWe must check for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (starting from 0) whether the player is at freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nOur goal: find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for t=0,1,...,H-1 such that at turn H-1 (the last action is applied at turn H-1 to get to turn H) we have y_H = 9, and we minimize H.\n\nNote: the player starts at y0 = 0. At turn 0, we are at (0,0). We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so no collision at turn 0.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8 at the turns when we are on them.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) to find the minimal H. The state can be (turn, y) and we simulate the actions. However, note that the car positions change with time, so the collision condition is time-dependent.\n\nWe note that the state must include the turn number (relative to t1=0) and the y-position. The turn number matters because the cars move as time progresses.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H. So we can do BFS over states (t, y) where t is the turn (starting at 0) and y in [0,9]. We start at (0,0) and we want to reach (t,9) for some t (and then H = t+1? Let me clarify).\n\nAt turn 0: we are at y0=0. We choose an action a0 which will determine y1 = y0 + delta. Then at turn 1, we are at y1, and so on. We require that at the last turn (say turn H-1) we choose an action that leads to y_{H} = 9. But note: the problem says we are to provide actions from t1 (which is 0) to t1+H-1. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and after that action we are at (0,9). So the state at turn H is (0,9). Therefore, we are looking for the smallest H such that we can reach (0,9) at turn H (meaning we have taken H actions from turn0 to turn H-1).\n\nIn the state, we are at a turn t (which is the current turn, after having taken actions at turns 0 to t-1) and at position y. Then we choose an action for this turn (which will update the position for turn t+1). However, the collision condition must be checked for the turn when we are at a freeway: that is, when we are at state (t, y) and y is in [1,8], we must check that at turn t, the player is not colliding with any car on freeway y.\n\nBut note: when we are at turn t, we have already taken actions up to turn t-1, and we are at (0,y) at the beginning of turn t? Actually, the problem says:\n\n- At turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T which will update to y_{T+1} = y_T + a_T.\n\nSo at the start of turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose a_T, and then at the start of turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore, the collision condition at turn T: we are at y_T (at the start of turn T) and we are about to take an action. We must avoid being on a freeway (y_T in [1,8]) and having 0 in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo for state (t, y): if y in [1,8], we must check the cars on freeway y at turn t (relative to t1=0, so absolute turn = t).\n\nWe can simulate:\n\n- Start: t=0, y=0 -> no collision (since y=0 is not a freeway)\n- Then we choose an action a0 -> leads to y1 = 0 + (delta from a0). Then at turn t=1, we are at y1. Then we check collision at turn t=1: if y1 in [1,8] then check cars on freeway y1 at turn 1.\n\nWe note that the cars move continuously: for a car on freeway k at turn 0: \n  span at turn t: [tail0 + s*t, head0 + s*t]   for right-moving.\n\nWe must check for each car on freeway k: is 0 in [tail0 + s*t, head0 + s*t]?\n\nGiven the car data:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  (48,37,right,6) -> at turn t: [37+6t, 48+6t]\n  (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6t, 12+6t]\n  (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+6t, -24+6t]\n\nFreeway 2: one car:\n  (-48,-83,right,36) -> [-83+36t, -48+36t]\n\nFreeways 3-8: each has two cars:\n  (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59+6t, -48+6t]\n  (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6t, 0+6t]   -> note: at turn t, this car spans from -11+6t to 0+6t.\n\nObserve for freeway 3-8, the second car at turn 0 is (0, -11, right, 6). So at turn t, it is [-11+6t, 0+6t]. The player collides if 0 is in that interval, i.e., \n  -11+6t <= 0 <= 0+6t\nBut note: 0 <= 0+6t is always true for t>=0? Actually, 0+6t >=0 for t>=0. And -11+6t <=0 => 6t<=11 => t<=11/6≈1.83. So at t=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n  -11<=0<=0 -> yes, 0 is the right endpoint? So at t=0, the car spans from -11 to 0, so 0 is included.\n\nTherefore, at turn 0, if the player is on freeway 3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn 0, they would collide because of the second car? But note: the player starts at turn0 at y=0, so not on any freeway. Then at turn1, if we go to y=1, then we are on freeway1 at turn1? But what if we go to y=3 at turn1? Then we are on freeway3 at turn1: we check the cars on freeway3 at turn1.\n\nAt turn1 for freeway3: \n  first car: [-59+6*1, -48+6*1] = [-53, -42] -> 0 not in this.\n  second car: [-11+6*1, 0+6*1] = [-5, 6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n\nTherefore, if we are on freeway3 at turn1, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 4,5,6,7,8: same thing.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turn1.\n\nNow, what about freeway1 at turn1? \n  Car1: [37+6, 48+6] = [43,54] -> 0 not in\n  Car2: [1+6, 12+6] = [7,18] -> 0 not in\n  Car3: [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18] -> 0 not in\nSo freeway1 is safe at turn1.\n\nFreeway2 at turn1:\n  [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn1, we can be on freeway1 or freeway2 safely? But wait, we start at y0=0. We can only move to y1=1 (by U) or stay at 0 (S) or go down? but we are at 0, so down is invalid? Actually, the movement: \n  if we choose D at y=0, then y1 = 0-1 = -1 -> but y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0. Similarly, we cannot go above 9.\n\nSo at turn0, we can choose:\n  U: then y1 = 1 -> freeway1 -> safe at turn1? yes, because freeway1 at turn1: no car has 0 in its span.\n  S: then y1 = 0 -> no freeway -> safe.\n  D: invalid? Actually, the rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and then we require y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try D at y0=0, we get y1=-1 -> invalid. So we cannot choose D.\n\nTherefore, at turn0, we can choose U or S.\n\nBut if we choose S, we stay at 0. Then at turn1, we are at y1=0. Then we choose again: same options: U or S (D invalid). \n\nWe want to get to 9. The minimal moves would be 9 U moves. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe must consider that we can also move down if we are above 0? But we start at 0 and we are trying to go up.\n\nBut note: we might need to wait (stay) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe can try to simulate the next few turns for freeways 3-8 to see when they become safe.\n\nFor freeway k (3 to 8) at turn t, the dangerous car is the one that was (0,-11,right,6). Its span at turn t: [-11+6t, 0+6t]. We require 0 not in this interval? \n  Condition for collision: -11+6t <= 0 <= 0+6t\n  The second inequality (0<=0+6t) is always true for t>=0? Actually, 0+6t>=0 for t>=0? Yes, since t>=0 -> 6t>=0 -> 0+6t>=0. The first inequality: -11+6t<=0 -> 6t<=11 -> t<=11/6≈1.83. So for integer t, t=0,1: collision, t>=2: safe? \n\nBut wait, at t=2: \n  [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeways 3-8 are safe at turn2 and beyond? \n\nBut what about the other car on freeways 3-8: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at turn t: [-59+6t, -48+6t]. When does 0 fall in this?\n  -59+6t <= 0 <= -48+6t\n  First: -59+6t<=0 -> 6t<=59 -> t<=59/6≈9.83 -> t<=9\n  Second: 0<=-48+6t -> 6t>=48 -> t>=8.\n\nSo for t in [8,9] inclusive? \n  t=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? (because 0 is the right endpoint) -> collision.\n  t=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nSo for freeways 3-8, the first car is dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeways 3-8 at turns 0,1,8,9? But turns 0 and 1 we already saw. And then again at 8 and 9.\n\nBut note: at turn0, we start at y=0, so not on freeway. At turn1, we can be on freeways 1 or 2? and then at turn2, we can be on freeways 3-8? But wait, at turn2, freeways 3-8 are safe (from the second car) but we have to avoid the first car? The first car is only dangerous at t=8 and 9. So for t not in {0,1,8,9}, freeways 3-8 are safe? Actually, at t=2, the first car: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> no 0. So safe.\n\nSo freeways 3-8 are dangerous only at turns 0,1,8,9? But we are not on them at turn0. At turn1, we can avoid them by going to freeway1 or 2. Then we can use freeways 3-8 at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,10,... but avoid at 8 and 9.\n\nNow, what about freeway1? \n  Car1: [37+6t,48+6t] -> 0 in it? 37+6t<=0<=48+6t -> but 37+6t>=37>0 for t>=0 -> never.\n  Car2: [1+6t,12+6t] -> 1+6t<=0<=12+6t -> first: 1+6t<=0 -> t<=-1/6 -> never. So safe for all t.\n  Car3: [-35+6t, -24+6t] -> -35+6t<=0<=-24+6t -> \n        first: -35+6t<=0 -> t<=35/6≈5.83 -> t<=5\n        second: 0<=-24+6t -> 6t>=24 -> t>=4\n      So for t=4,5: \n        t=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes (right endpoint)\n        t=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 included.\n\nSo freeway1 is dangerous at turns 4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: \n  Only car: [-83+36t, -48+36t]\n  0 in it? \n      -83+36t <=0<=-48+36t\n      First: -83+36t<=0 -> 36t<=83 -> t<=83/36≈2.305 -> t<=2\n      Second: 0<=-48+36t -> 36t>=48 -> t>=48/36=4/3≈1.333 -> t>=2 (since t integer, t>=2)\n\n      So for t=2: \n          First: -83+72 = -11<=0 -> true\n          Second: 0<=-48+72=24 -> true -> collision at t=2.\n      t=1: \n          First: -83+36 = -47<=0 -> true\n          Second: 0<=-48+36=-12 -> false -> no collision.\n      t=3: \n          First: -83+108=25<=0? false -> no.\n\n      So freeway2 is dangerous only at t=2.\n\nTherefore, summary for each freeway and dangerous turns:\n\nfreeway1: dangerous at t=4,5\nfreeway2: dangerous at t=2\nfreeway3: dangerous at t=0,1,8,9\nfreeway4: same as 3\nfreeway5: same as 3\nfreeway6: same as 3\nfreeway7: same as 3\nfreeway8: same as 3\n\nBut note: at turn0, we are at y=0 (safe). At turn1, we can be at y=0 (safe) or y=1 (freeway1: safe at t=1) or y=2 (freeway2: safe at t=1? because dangerous at t=2, so at t=1: safe).\n\nAt turn1, freeway2: \n  car: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo at turn1, we can be on freeway1 (safe) or freeway2 (safe) or 0 (safe). We cannot be on freeways 3-8 at turn1 (because they are dangerous at turn1).\n\nWe are at turn0: y0=0. We choose:\n\nOption1: U -> then y1=1 (freeway1) -> safe at turn1.\nOption2: S -> then y1=0 -> safe.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible? But we have to avoid the dangerous turns.\n\nWe need to get to 9. The minimal number of moves if no obstacles: 9 moves (all U). But we have to avoid being on freeway1 at turns4 and5, and freeway2 at turn2, and freeways3-8 at turns0,1,8,9.\n\nSince we start at turn0 at y0=0, and we must not be on freeways3-8 at turn1, we can only go to y=1 (freeway1) or stay at 0 at turn1.\n\nIf we go to y1=1 (freeway1) at turn1, then at turn2 we can choose to go to:\n  U: y2=2 -> freeway2 at turn2 -> but freeway2 is dangerous at turn2 -> collision -> invalid.\n  S: y2=1 -> freeway1 at turn2: freeway1 at turn2 is safe (since dangerous only at 4,5) -> valid.\n  D: y2=0 -> safe.\n\nBut if we go to y2=1 (by S) then we are at freeway1 at turn2. Then at turn3 we can go to y3=2 (freeway2) -> at turn3: freeway2 at turn3? \n  freeway2 at turn3: car span: [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed up? But we must avoid freeway1 at turns4 and5. So if we are at freeway1 at turn4 or 5, we must not be there.\n\nSo if we are at y3=2 (freeway2) at turn3, then at turn4 we can go to y4=3 (freeway3) -> but freeway3 at turn4: is it dangerous? \n  freeway3 dangerous at turns0,1,8,9 -> turn4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut wait: we are at y3=2 at turn3. Then we want to go to y4=3 at turn4: safe (freeway3 at turn4 safe). Then at turn5: we can go to y5=4 -> freeway4 at turn5: safe? freeway4 dangerous at turns0,1,8,9 -> turn5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y6=5 at turn6, y7=6 at turn7, y8=7 at turn8, y9=8 at turn9, and then y10=9 at turn10? \n\nBut note: at turn8, we are at freeway8? and freeway8 is dangerous at turn8? yes! because freeways3-8 are dangerous at turn8. So if we are at y8=7 at turn8? no: if we are at y8=7 at turn8, then we are on freeway7 at turn8 -> dangerous! because freeway7 is dangerous at turn8.\n\nWait: the dangerous turns for freeways 3-8 are 8 and 9. So at turn8, if we are on freeway7 (y=7) at turn8, that is dangerous? yes.\n\nSo we cannot be on any freeway from 3 to 8 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nSo if we are at turn7, we are at some freeway? we need to plan.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to get to 9 faster? \n\nIdea: we can go up quickly to freeway1 and then wait (stay) until after turn5? because freeway1 is dangerous at turn4 and5. So if we are at freeway1 at turn3, then we must leave by turn4? \n\nBut we are at turn0: y0=0 -> turn1: y1=1 (freeway1) -> safe.\nturn2: we can choose to stay at 1 (freeway1) -> safe? because freeway1 at turn2 is safe (dangerous only at 4,5).\nturn3: stay at 1 -> safe.\nturn4: if we are at 1 at turn4 -> collision (freeway1 dangerous at turn4) -> so we must leave freeway1 at turn3? or before turn4? \n\nAt turn3, we can move up to 2 (freeway2) -> at turn3: freeway2 is safe (as we saw: at turn3, freeway2: [25,60] -> no 0). \nThen at turn4: we are at freeway2? no: at turn4, we are at y4? We were at y3=2 at turn3. Then we choose an action at turn3: if we choose U, then y4=3 (freeway3). But at turn4, freeway3 is safe (since dangerous only at 0,1,8,9). So that is safe.\n\nBut then we have to avoid freeways3-8 at turn8 and9. How? We are at turn4: we are at y4=3. We want to get to 9. The minimal moves: 5 more moves: UUUUU -> then we would be at y9=8 at turn9? and then at turn10: we go to 9? \n\nBut at turn8: where are we? \n  turn4: y4=3\n  turn5: y5=4\n  turn6: y6=5\n  turn7: y7=6\n  turn8: y8=7 -> freeway7 at turn8 -> dangerous! -> collision.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway7 at turn8. How to avoid?\n\nOption: at some point, we wait (stay) so that we skip the dangerous turn8 and9 on the freeways? \n\nAlternatively, we can go faster? But we are already going up as fast as we can? \n\nAnother idea: go to freeway2 at turn3, then at turn4 go to freeway3, then at turn5,6,7 we go up to 4,5,6, then at turn7 we are at 6. Then at turn8, if we go up to 7 -> dangerous. So we can stay at 6 at turn8? but then at turn8 we are at freeway6 -> dangerous! because freeway6 is dangerous at turn8? \n\nAll freeways 3-8 are dangerous at turn8 and9. So we must not be on any of these freeways at turn8 and9.\n\nSo we must be either at 0,1,2 or 9 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nBut we are going to 9. At turn8, we cannot be at 9? because we are moving one step at a time. The earliest we can be at 9 is at turn9: if we are at 8 at turn8, then we go up at turn8 to 9 at turn9? but at turn9, we are at 9 -> safe (not a freeway). However, at turn8 we are at 8 (freeway8) -> dangerous! \n\nSo if we are at 8 at turn8 (freeway8) -> collision. Therefore, we cannot be at 8 at turn8.\n\nWhat if we are at 7 at turn7? Then at turn7 we can choose to go up to 8 at turn8 -> then at turn8 we are at freeway8 -> collision. Or stay at 7 at turn8 -> freeway7 -> collision. Or go down to 6 at turn8 -> freeway6 -> collision. \n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turn8 and turn9. Therefore, at turn8 and turn9, we must be at y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut we are trying to get to 9. So at turn8, we could be at 9? How? \n  To be at 9 at turn8, we would have to be at 8 at turn7, then U at turn7 -> then at turn8 we are at 9. \n  But at turn7, if we are at 8 (freeway8) -> then we are at freeway8 at turn7: dangerous? freeway8 dangerous at turns0,1,8,9 -> turn7 is safe. So we can be at 8 at turn7? \n\nThen at turn7: we are at 8 (freeway8) -> safe (because turn7 not in {0,1,8,9}). Then we choose U at turn7: then at turn8 we are at 9 -> safe (not a freeway). Then we are done? \n\nBut wait, we need to check: the sequence would be:\n\nturn0: U -> y1=1 (at turn1: freeway1 -> safe)\nturn1: U -> y2=2 (at turn2: freeway2 -> dangerous at turn2 -> collision) -> invalid.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn1 to go to freeway2 at turn2.\n\nWe have to avoid freeway2 at turn2. So we must not be at freeway2 at turn2.\n\nTherefore, at turn1: we are at y1=1 (freeway1) -> safe.\nAt turn1, we choose an action: \n  U: then at turn2 we are at y2=2 -> freeway2 at turn2 -> collision -> invalid.\n  S: then y2=1 -> freeway1 at turn2 -> safe (since freeway1 safe at turn2).\n  D: then y2=0 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn2: if we are at 1, then we can choose at turn2:\n  U: then at turn3 we are at y3=2 -> freeway2 at turn3 -> safe (as computed: [25,60] -> no 0).\n  S: stay at 1 -> safe.\n  D: down to 0 -> safe.\n\nSo if we do: \n  turn0: U -> y1=1\n  turn1: S -> y2=1\n  turn2: U -> y3=2 (freeway2 at turn3: safe) -> then we can proceed.\n\nThen at turn3: we are at 2. Then we choose U: then at turn4 we are at 3 (freeway3 at turn4: safe? because freeway3 dangerous only at 0,1,8,9 -> safe).\n\nThen we continue:\n  turn3: U -> y4=3\n  turn4: U -> y5=4 (freeway4 at turn5: safe? freeway4 dangerous only at 0,1,8,9 -> safe)\n  turn5: U -> y6=5 (freeway5 at turn6: safe)\n  turn6: U -> y7=6 (freeway6 at turn7: safe? because freeway6 dangerous only at 0,1,8,9 -> turn7 safe)\n  turn7: U -> y8=7 (freeway7 at turn8: dangerous! -> collision) -> invalid.\n\nSo we must avoid being at 7 at turn8.\n\nWe need to adjust: we must not be on freeway7 at turn8. So we can either:\n  - Be at 6 at turn7 and then at turn7 choose to stay at 6? Then at turn8 we are at 6 -> freeway6 at turn8 -> collision.\n  - Or go down? but then we are at freeway5 at turn8? -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we can slow down earlier? \n\nWe can try to wait at freeway1 until after turn5? \n\nPlan: \n  turn0: U -> y1=1\n  turn1: S -> y2=1\n  turn2: S -> y3=1 (freeway1 at turn3: safe? because dangerous only at 4,5 -> safe at turn3)\n  turn3: S -> y4=1 -> but freeway1 at turn4: dangerous! -> collision.\n\nSo we must leave freeway1 by turn3? \n\nAt turn2: we are at 1 (freeway1, safe at turn2). We can choose to go up at turn2 to 2 at turn3? \n  turn2: U -> then at turn3: y3=2 -> freeway2 at turn3: safe.\n\nThen we are at 2 at turn3. Then we can go up to 3 at turn4: safe (freeway3 at turn4 safe). Then we have to get from 3 to 9 in 5 moves? but then at turn8 we would be at 8? \n  turn3: y3=2\n  turn4: U -> 3\n  turn5: U -> 4\n  turn6: U -> 5\n  turn7: U -> 6\n  turn8: U -> 7 -> freeway7 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nWe need to take 6 moves from 3 to 9: 6 moves? but we can only do one per turn? so 6 moves: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: that takes 6 moves (from turn4 to turn9). Then at turn9 we are at 9? \n\nBut at turn8: we would be at 8 (freeway8) -> dangerous. \n\nSo we must avoid freeway8 at turn8. Therefore, we cannot be at 8 at turn8.\n\nWe can try to be at 7 at turn7? Then at turn7 we go up to 8 at turn8 -> then at turn8 we are at freeway8 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at 6 at turn7, then at turn7 we wait (S) -> then at turn8 we are at 6 (freeway6) -> collision.\n\nWe can be at 5 at turn7, then at turn7 we go up to 6 at turn8 -> freeway6 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nSo we must be at a freeway not in 3-8 at turn8? that is 1 or 2? \n\nHow can we be at 1 or 2 at turn8? \n\nWe have to go down? \n\nBut we are trying to go up to 9.\n\nIdea: go up to 6 at turn6, then at turn6 we go down? but then we waste moves.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up quickly to 9 by turn8? but we cannot: because we start at 0 and need 9 moves? \n\nWe start at turn0:0 -> turn1:1 -> turn2:2 -> turn3:3 -> turn4:4 -> turn5:5 -> turn6:6 -> turn7:7 -> turn8:8 -> then at turn9:9. \nBut at turn8 we are at 8 -> collision.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn8? That would require 8 moves: from 0 to 8 in 8 moves? but 8 moves of U would get us to 8, not 9. So we need 9 moves? \n\nBut we can only do 8 moves from turn0 to turn7: then at turn8 we are at 8 -> collision.\n\nWe must avoid the dangerous turns by waiting at safe spots.\n\nWe can wait at freeway2? freeway2 is dangerous only at turn2. So after turn2, freeway2 is safe. Similarly, freeway1 is safe except at turn4,5.\n\nSo we can plan:\n\nWe want to be at 9 at the earliest turn? But we must avoid freeways3-8 at turn8 and9. \n\nAt turn8 and turn9, we must be at 0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut we are at 0 at turn0. We need to get to 9.\n\nWe can try to get to 2 by turn2? but freeway2 at turn2 is dangerous. So we cannot be at 2 at turn2.\n\nWe can be at 2 at turn3? yes, safe.\n\nThen we have to get from 2 to 9. The minimal moves: 7 moves (if we go U each time) -> then we would be at 9 at turn10? \n  turn3:2\n  turn4:3\n  turn5:4\n  turn6:5\n  turn7:6\n  turn8:7 -> freeway7 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nSo we must not be at 7 at turn8.\n\nWe can spend one turn waiting at a safe freeway? But freeways3-8 are not safe at turn8,9. So we must be at 0,1,2 at turn8 and9.\n\nBut we are at 2 at turn3. Then if we go up to 3 at turn4, then to 4 at turn5, then to 5 at turn6, then to 6 at turn7. Then at turn7 we are at 6. We cannot go up at turn7 because then at turn8 we would be at 7 -> collision. We can go down? then we go to 5 at turn8 -> freeway5 at turn8 -> collision. Or stay at 6 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nSo we must get to 0,1,2 by turn8. How? from 6 at turn7, we can go down to 5 at turn8? -> collision. Or down to 5 at turn7 and then down to 4 at turn8? -> freeway4 at turn8 -> collision. We have to go all the way down to 2 at turn8? \n\nBut from 6 at turn7, we need 4 downs? not possible in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at 6 at turn7. We must be lower at turn7.\n\nWe can try to wait at freeway2 (which is safe after turn2) for several turns? \n\nFor example, at turn3: we are at 2 (freeway2, safe). We can stay at 2 for several turns? \n  freeway2: dangerous only at turn2. So at turn3,4,5,... it is safe.\n\nSo we can stay at freeway2 until we are ready to go up, but we have to avoid freeways3-8 at turn8 and9.\n\nWe can stay at 2 until turn7? then at turn7 we go up to 3 at turn8? -> freeway3 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nWe can go up from 2 to 3 at turn7? then at turn8 we are at 3 -> collision.\n\nWe must be at 0,1,2 or 9 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nSo at turn7, we must choose an action that by turn8 we are at one of 0,1,2,9. \n\nBut to be at 9 at turn8, we would have to be at 8 at turn7 and then U. But 8 at turn7: freeway8 at turn7 -> safe? yes. Then at turn7: U -> then at turn8:9 -> safe.\n\nSo this is possible! \n\nBut how to be at 8 at turn7? \n\nWe are at turn3: y3=2. Then we have 4 turns (turn3, turn4, turn5, turn6) to get from 2 to 8? that's 6 levels: we need 6 moves of U. But we only have 4 turns? we can only do 4 moves. So we can get to 2+4=6 at turn7. \n\nWe need to be at 8 at turn7, so we are 2 levels short.\n\nTherefore, we need to be higher earlier.\n\nWe need to get to a higher freeway sooner, but we have to avoid freeway1 at turn4,5 and freeway2 at turn2.\n\nLet me try to go faster initially:\n\n turn0: U -> y1=1\n turn1: U -> but then at turn2 we are at 2 -> freeway2 at turn2 -> collision -> invalid.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn1.\n\n turn0: S -> y1=0\n turn1: U -> y2=1 (freeway1 at turn2: safe) \n turn2: U -> y3=2 (freeway2 at turn3: safe) \n turn3: U -> y4=3 (freeway3 at turn4: safe)\n turn4: U -> y5=4 (freeway4 at turn5: safe)\n turn5: U -> y6=5 (freeway5 at turn6: safe)\n turn6: U -> y7=6 (freeway6 at turn7: safe)\n turn7: U -> y8=7 (freeway7 at turn8: collision) -> invalid.\n\nSame problem.\n\n turn0: U -> y1=1\n turn1: S -> y2=1\n turn2: U -> y3=2\n turn3: U -> y4=3\n turn4: U -> y5=4\n turn5: U -> y6=5\n turn6: U -> y7=6\n turn7: U -> y8=7 -> collision at turn8.\n\nHow can we be at 8 at turn7? We need to be at 1 at turn1, then at turn2 we must be at 2, turn3 at 3, turn4 at 4, turn5 at 5, turn6 at 6, turn7 at 7, turn8 at 8 -> then at turn8 collision.\n\nUnless we skip a move? \n\nWe need to gain an extra move? impossible.\n\nAnother idea: go to freeway2 earlier? but freeway2 at turn2 is dangerous. We can be at freeway2 at turn1? \n  turn0: U -> y1=1\n  turn1: U -> y2=2 at turn2? -> collision.\n\n turn0: U -> y1=1\n turn1: D -> y2=0 (safe) \n turn2: U -> y3=1 (freeway1 at turn3: safe)\n turn3: U -> y4=2 (freeway2 at turn4: safe? freeway2 dangerous only at turn2 -> safe)\n turn4: U -> y5=3 (freeway3 at turn5: safe)\n turn5: U -> y6=4 (freeway4 at turn6: safe)\n turn6: U -> y7=5 (freeway5 at turn7: safe)\n turn7: U -> y8=6 (freeway6 at turn8: collision) -> invalid.\n\nWe are at 6 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nWe need to be at 8 at turn7. How about this:\n\n turn0: U -> 1 (turn1)\n turn1: S -> 1 (turn2)   [avoided freeway2 at turn2]\n turn2: U -> 2 (turn3)   [freeway2 at turn3: safe]\n turn3: U -> 3 (turn4)   [freeway3 at turn4: safe]\n turn4: U -> 4 (turn5)   [freeway4 at turn5: safe]\n turn5: U -> 5 (turn6)   [freeway5 at turn6: safe]\n turn6: U -> 6 (turn7)   [freeway6 at turn7: safe]\n turn7: U -> 7 (turn8)   [freeway7 at turn8: collision] -> invalid.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWe must find a way to be at 8 at turn7. That means we need to cover from 0 to 8 in 7 moves. That requires 8 steps, but we only have 7 moves? so we end at 7 at turn7.\n\nUnless we move twice in one turn? no.\n\nPerhaps we can use the down move to avoid the dangerous freeway1 at turn4,5 and then come back up? \n\nFor example:\n\n turn0: U -> 1\n turn1: S -> 1  (waiting at freeway1)\n turn2: U -> 2  (now at freeway2 at turn3: safe)\n turn3: U -> 3\n turn4: We are at 3 at turn4. But freeway1 is dangerous at turn4,5, but we are not on freeway1. \n  However, we have to continue: \n  turn4: U -> 4\n  turn5: if we go U to 5, then we are on freeway5 at turn5: safe? yes.\n  But then at turn5, freeway1 is dangerous, but we are not on it.\n  turn5: we are at 5. Then turn6: U to 6\n  turn7: U to 7 -> at turn8 we are at 7 -> collision.\n\n not working.\n\nAt turn4, instead of going to 4, we could go down to 2? \n  turn4: D -> from 3 to 2 (freeway2 at turn5: safe? freeway2 after turn2 is safe) \n  then at turn5: we are at 2. Then we can go up from there? \n  turn5: U -> 3 (freeway3 at turn6: safe)\n  turn6: U -> 4\n  turn7: U -> 5\n  turn8: U -> 6 -> freeway6 at turn8 -> collision.\n\n not working.\n\nAt turn4: we are at 3. We could wait (S) -> turn5: still at 3 (freeway3 at turn5: safe? freeway3 dangerous only at 0,1,8,9 -> safe). \n  turn5: U -> 4\n  turn6: U -> 5\n  turn7: U -> 6\n  turn8: U -> 7 -> collision.\n\n still collision at turn8.\n\nWe need to reach 8 at turn7. So we must make up the moves somewhere.\n\n turn0: U (1)\n turn1: U is invalid (because freeway2 at turn2 is dangerous). \n turn1: S (1)\n turn2: U (2) at turn3.\n turn3: U (3) at turn4.\n turn4: U (4) at turn5.\n turn5: U (5) at turn6.\n turn6: U (6) at turn7.\n turn7: U (7) at turn8 -> collision.\n\nWe are one move short of 8 at turn7.\n\nUnless we start with two ups in a row? but turn1: if we do U at turn0 and turn1, we are at 2 at turn2 -> collision.\n\nWe can do:\n\n turn0: U (1)\n turn1: D (0)  [ then at turn2: we are at 0 ]\n turn2: U (1)\n turn3: U (2)  [ at turn4: we are at 2? no: at turn3: we are at 2? ]\n\nBut at turn2: we are at 0 -> safe.\n turn3: U -> 1 at turn3 (freeway1 at turn3: safe)\n turn4: U -> 2 at turn4 ( freeway2 at turn4: safe)\n turn5: U -> 3\n turn6: U -> 4\n turn7: U -> 5\n turn8: U -> 6 -> collision at turn8.\n\n not enough.\n\nWe must include more moves.\n\nLet me count the moves to 8: 8 moves. We start at turn0. Then we need to be at 8 at turn8? but then freeway8 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nWe can be at 8 at turn7: then we need to do 8 moves in 7 actions: that means we must have 7 actions that include only U and possibly S or D? impossible to gain 8 levels in 7 actions if we only move +1 per action.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at turn8? then we need to gain 9 levels in 8 actions: turn0 to turn8: 8 actions will move 8 levels -> we would be at 8 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot avoid being on a freeway at turn8 or turn9 if we try to go straight up.\n\nWe must therefore wait out turns 8 and 9 at a safe freeway (0,1,2) and then after turn9, go up.\n\nSo we need to get to 2 by turn7, then wait at 2 for turns 8 and 9? then after turn9, we can go up.\n\nBut then we are at turn7: we are at 2. Then at turn7: we are at 2 -> safe (freeway2).\n turn8: S or U or D? but we must avoid moving to a freeway in 3-8. If we choose S: then at turn8 we are at 2 -> safe.\n turn9: S -> at turn9 we are at 2 -> safe.\n turn10: U -> 3 (freeway3 at turn10: safe, because freeway3 dangerous only at 0,1,8,9 -> turn10 is safe)\n then we can go up: \n turn10: 3\n turn11: 4\n turn12: 5\n turn13: 6\n turn14: 7\n turn15: 8\n turn16: 9 -> done.\n\nBut this is 16 turns? we can do better.\n\nWe can try to be as high as possible before turn8, then drop to 2 for turn8 and9, then go up.\n\nFor example, at turn7, we want to be at 2. How high can we be at turn7? \n\nWe have from turn0 to turn7: 7 actions.\n\nWe start at 0.\n We need to avoid:\n   - At turn2: cannot be at freeway2.\n   - At turn4,5: cannot be at freeway1.\n   - At turn0,1,8,9: cannot be at freeways3-8, but turn0,1: we are not on them initially.\n\nWe can try to maximize the upward moves while avoiding the dangerous turns.\n\n turn0: U -> 1 ( turn1: freeway1 -> safe)\n turn1: S -> 1 ( turn2: freeway1 -> safe)   [because we avoid freeway2 at turn2]\n turn2: U -> 2 ( turn3: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn3: U -> 3 ( turn4: freeway3 -> safe)\n turn4: U -> 4 ( turn5: freeway4 -> safe)\n turn5: U -> 5 ( turn6: freeway5 -> safe)\n turn6: U -> 6 ( turn7: freeway6 -> safe)\n turn7: we are at 6 at turn7. We need to be at 2 at turn8? \n        but to get from 6 to 2 in one move: we need to move down 4 times? -> impossible.\n\n turn7: D -> 5 at turn8 -> freeway5 at turn8 -> collision.\n\n not good.\n\n turn0: U -> 1\n turn1: S -> 1\n turn2: S -> 1  [ waiting at freeway1 during turn2 and turn3?]\n turn3: U -> 2 ( turn4: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn4: U -> 3 ( turn5: freeway3 -> safe)\n turn5: U -> 4 ( turn6: freeway4 -> safe)\n turn6: U -> 5 ( turn7: freeway5 -> safe)\n turn7: D -> 4 at turn8 -> freeway4 at turn8 -> collision.\n\n not good.\n\nWe need to be at 2 at turn7. How to do that?\n\n turn0: U -> 1\n turn1: S -> 1\n turn2: U -> 2 ( turn3: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn3: S -> 2 ( turn4: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn4: S -> 2 ( turn5: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn5: S -> 2 ( turn6: free freeway2 -> safe)\n turn6: S -> 2 ( turn7: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn7: we are at 2.\n\nThen turn7: S -> 2 at turn8 (safe)\n turn8: S -> 2 at turn9 (safe)\n turn9: U -> 3 ( turn10: freeway3 -> safe)\n turn10: U -> 4\n turn11: U -> 5\n turn12: U -> 6\n turn13: U -> 7\n turn14: U -> 8\n turn15: U -> 9\n\nThis works, but it's 15 actions? and we are at 9 at turn15.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe could try to get to a higher floor before turn7, but then at turn7 move down to 2? \n\nFor example, at turn6: we can be at 5 ( by a sequence that gets to 5 at turn6), then at turn6: choose D -> then at turn7:4? then at turn7: choose D again? then at turn8:3 -> collision.\n\n not good.\n\n turn6: at 5. then at turn6: choose to move down twice? not possible in one turn.\n\nWe must move one step per turn.\n\nSo the only safe floor at turn8 and turn9 is 0,1,2 or 9. 9 is not achievable until later.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 0,1, or 2 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to be at 2 at turn7, then wait at turn7 and turn8 to be at 2 for turn8 and turn9, then starting from turn9 we can go up.\n\nBut at turn9, we are at 2. Then we need 7 ups to get to 9: \n  turn9: U -> 3\n  turn10: U -> 4\n  turn11: U -> 5\n  turn12: U -> 6\n  turn13: U -> 7\n  turn14: U -> 8\n  turn15: U -> 9\n\nSo total turns: from turn0 to turn15 ( actions at turn0 to turn15) -> 16 actions, then at turn16 we are at 9.\n\nH = number of actions = 16.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 sooner? \n\nWe could try to be at 1 at turn7, then at turn7: U to 2 at turn8 -> safe ( freeway2 at turn8: we said safe after turn2) -> then at turn8: we are at 2.\n turn8: we can choose to move to 3 at turn9? -> but freeway3 at turn9: dangerous! because freeway3 dangerous at turn9.\n\nSo at turn9, we must not be on freeway3. Therefore, at turn8, if we are at 2, we must not move to 3 at turn8 because then at turn9 we would be at 3 -> collision.\n\nSo at turn8, we must either stay at 2 or move to 1 or 0.\n\nThen at turn9: we are at 0,1, or 2. Then at turn9: we can start moving up.\n\nThis also takes 16 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at 2 at turn7, then at turn7: we can move to 1 or 0? then at turn8: we are at 1 or 0, and at turn8: we can move to 2 ( from 0 or 1) -> then at turn9: we are at 2. Then turn9: U to 3.\n\nThis doesn't save anything.\n\n So minimal H is 16.\n\nLet me write the sequence for the first option:\n\n turn0: U  -> y1=1\n turn1: S  -> y2=1\n turn2: U  -> y3=2\n turn3: S  -> y4=2\n turn4: S  -> y5=2\n turn5: S  -> y6=2\n turn6: S  -> y7=2\n turn7: S  -> y8=2   [ for turn8: at freeway2, safe]\n turn8: S  -> y9=2   [ for turn9: at freeway2, safe]\n turn9: U  -> y10=3\n turn10: U -> y11=4\n turn11: U -> y12=5\n turn12: U -> y13=6\n turn13: U -> y14=7\n turn14: U -> y15=8\n turn15: U -> y16=9\n\nThen we are at 9 at turn16.\n\nBut is freeway2 safe at turn8 and9? \n  freeway2 has only one car: [-83+36t, -48+36t]\n  at turn8: [-83+36*8, -48+36*8] = [-83+288, -48+288] = [205,240] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  at turn9: [-83+324, -48+324] = [241,276] -> safe.\n\nAlso, at turn7: freeway2 at turn7: [-83+36*7, -48+36*7] = [-83+252, -48+252] = [169,204] -> safe.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in less than 16 actions? \n\nWe could try to use freeway1 more and avoid freeway2 initially.\n\n turn0: U -> 1\n turn1: S -> 1\n turn2: S -> 1   [ at turn2: freeway1 is safe? freeway1 dangerous at turn4,5 -> turn2 safe]\n turn3: S -> 1   [ turn3: freeway1 safe]\n turn4: must leave freeway1: so at turn4, we cannot be at 1. We can go to 0 or 2.\n   If we go to 0: then at turn5: we can go back to 1? but freeway1 at turn5: dangerous.\n   If we go to 2: freeway2 at turn4: safe.\n\n turn4: U -> 2 ( at turn5: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn5: U -> 3 ( at turn6: freeway3 -> safe)\n turn6: U -> 4 ( at turn7: freeway4 -> safe)\n turn7: we are at 4. We need to be at 0,1,2 at turn8. So we must go down.\n turn7: D -> 3 at turn8 -> freeway3 at turn8 -> collision.\n\n turn7: two downs? not possible.\n\n turn7: D -> 3 ( then at turn8: we are at 3 -> collision)\n\n not good.\n\n turn4: from 1, we can go down to 0 at turn5: \n   turn4: D -> 0 ( at turn5: safe)\n   turn5: we are at 0. Then we can go to 1 at turn6: freeway1 at turn6: safe? freeway1 dangerous only at 4,5 -> safe.\n   turn6: U -> 1\n   turn7: U -> 2 ( at turn8: freeway2 -> safe, because freeway2 dangerous only at turn2 -> safe)\n   turn8: we are at 2. Then at turn8: S -> 2 ( at turn9: freeway2 -> safe)\n   turn9: U -> 3\n   then continue as before to 9.\n\nNow count the actions:\n\n turn0: U (1)\n turn1: S (1)\n turn2: S (1)\n turn3: S (1)\n turn4: D (0)\n turn5: we are at 0. Then action at turn5: U -> 1 ( at turn6: freeway1 -> safe)\n turn6: U -> 2 ( at turn7: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn7: we are at 2. Then at turn7: we need to be at 2 for turn8? \n        turn7: S -> 2 ( at turn8: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn8: S -> 2 ( at turn9: freeway2 -> safe)\n turn9: U -> 3\n turn10: U ->4\n turn11: U ->5\n turn12: U ->6\n turn13: U ->7\n turn14: U ->8\n turn15: U ->9\n\nThis is also 16 actions.\n\nBut we might be able to be higher at turn7? \n\nIn this sequence, at turn7: we are at 2.\n\nCan we be at a higher floor before turn7 and then get to 2 by turn7? \n\nFor example, if we are at 3 at turn6, then at turn6: D -> then at turn7:2. \n\nHow to be at 3 at turn6? \n\n turn0: U (1)\n turn1: S (1)\n turn2: U (2) -> at turn3: freeway2 -> safe.\n turn3: U (3) -> at turn4: freeway3 -> safe.\n turn4: U (4) -> at turn5: freeway4 -> safe.\n turn5: U (5) -> at turn6: freeway5 -> safe.\n turn6: D (4) -> then at turn7:4? but we want to be at 2 at turn7. \n\n then at turn6: we are at 5, and we need to be at 2 at turn7: impossible.\n\n turn6: three downs? not possible.\n\nTherefore, the fastest is to be at 2 at turn7, and then wait for turns 7,8 to be at 2 for turns 8 and 9, then go up.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, at turn7 we are at 2, and then we wait at turn7 and turn8 (so turn7: S, turn8: S) to be at 2 for turn8 and turn9.\n\nThen at turn9, we start moving up.\n\nBut note: at turn9, we are at 2. Then we do U at turn9 to go to 3 at turn10.\n\n total actions from turn0 to turn15: 16 actions.\n\nBut the last action is at turn15, and after that we are at 9 at turn16. \n\nHowever, the problem requires a sequence of actions from turn0 to turn0+H-1 such that at turn0+H-1 (the last action) we are at (0,9)? \n\nLet me clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn0 (current turn), we are at (0,0). \nWe choose a0, then at turn1, we are at y1 = 0 + a0.\nWe choose a1 at turn1, then at turn2, we are at y2 = y1 + a1.\n...\nWe choose a_{H-1} at turn (0+H-1) = turn_{H-1}, and after this action, we are at y_H = 9.\n\nSo the condition is that after the last action (at turn H-1), we are at 9.\n\nIn our sequence, we want to be at 9 at turn H.\n\nThe actions are from turn0 to turn_{H-1}. \n\nIn the above sequence, if we are at 9 at turn16, then the last action was at turn15, so H-1 = 15, hence H=16.\n\nAnd the sequence has 16 actions: a0 to a15.\n\nBut can we be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWhat if we are at 8 at turn15, and then at turn15 we choose U -> then at turn16 we are at 9. \n So the last action is at turn15, and we are at 9 at turn16.\n\nThat is the earliest we can be at 9 given the constraints.\n\nTherefore, H=16.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at 9 at turn15 ( then last action at turn14).\n\nThat would require that at turn14 we are at 8, and then we choose U at turn14 -> then at turn15 we are at 9.\n\nBut to be at 8 at turn14, we need 8 ups from some floor. But we start at 0. \n\nMinimal turns to get to 8: 8 actions. But we have to avoid the dangerous turns.\n\nMoreover, we must be not on freeway8 at turn14? freeway8 is dangerous only at turn8 and9. So at turn14: freeway8 is safe.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeway1 at turn4,5 and freeway2 at turn2, and freeways3-8 at turn8,9.\n\nCan we do it in 14 actions to be at 8 at turn14? \n\nWe need to cover 8 levels in 14 actions, which is plenty, but we have to wait at safe spots during dangerous turns.\n\nSpecifically, at turn8 and9, we must not be on freeways3-8.\n\nSo we must be at 0,1,2 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nHow to be at 8 at turn14:\n\n We have from turn0 to turn14: 15 actions, but we only need to be at 8 at turn14.\n\nWe can try to be at 2 at turn7, then at turn7 and turn8 and turn9 we are at 2, then from turn9 to turn14: 5 actions to go from 2 to 8: that's 6 levels -> requires 6 actions, but we have only 5 actions -> cannot.\n\n turn9: at 2\n turn10: 3\n turn11: 4\n turn12: 5\n turn13: 6\n turn14: 7 -> not 8.\n\nSo we would be at 7 at turn14. Then at turn14: U -> 8 at turn15 -> then we are at 8 at turn15. Then we need another action at turn15: U -> 9 at turn16.\n\nSo still 16 actions.\n\nIf we are at 3 at turn9, then we can do 5 actions to get to 8 at turn14: 3->4->5->6->7->8: that's 5 actions, so at turn14: we are at 8. Then at turn14: U -> 9 at turn15. \n Then the last action is at turn14? and we are at 9 at turn15. \n\nBut then the action at turn14 is U, and after that we are at 9.\n\nSo H = number of actions = 15? \n\nThen the actions are from turn0 to turn14 (H=15 actions).\n\nBut how to be at 3 at turn9? \n\n turn0:0\n turn1:1 (U)\n turn2:1 (S)  [ to avoid freeway2 at turn2]\n turn3:2 (U)  [ at turn4: freeway2 -> safe]\n turn4:3 (U)  [ at turn5: freeway3 -> safe]\n turn5:4 (U)  [ at turn6: freeway4 -> safe]\n turn6:5 (U)  [ at turn7: freeway5 -> safe]\n turn7:6 (U)  [ at turn8: freeway6 -> collision!] -> because freeway6 is dangerous at turn8.\n\n So not safe.\n\nWe must be at a safe floor at turn8 and9.\n\nSo at turn7: we must move to a safe floor (0,1,2) for turn8 and9.\n\nFor example, at turn7: we are at 6. We must move down to 2 in one move? -> impossible.\n\nSo we must be at 2 at turn7.\n\nThen turn7: S ( to be at 2 for turn8)\n turn8: S ( to be at 2 for turn9)\n turn9: U -> 3 at turn10\n turn10: U->4\n turn11: U->5\n turn12: U->6\n turn13: U->7\n turn14: U->8\n turn15: U->9\n\n still 16 actions.\n\nThe only way to be at 3 at turn9 is if we are at 3 at turn9 without being on a freeway in 3-8 at turn8 and9. \n\nWe can try to be at 3 at turn9 by:\n  turn8: we are at 2 (safe)\n  turn8: U -> then at turn9: we are at 3 -> freeway3 at turn9 -> collision.\n\n so not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at 0,1,2 at turn9.\n\nThen at turn9, we are at one of these. The highest is 2.\n\nThen we need 7 actions to go from 2 to 9.\n\nSo from turn9 to turn15: 7 actions.\n\nThen the earliest we can be at 9 is turn16.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 16.\n\n Now, we need to output the sequence.\n\nWe can use the first safe sequence I mentioned:\n\n actions at turn0 to turn15:\n\n turn0: U\n turn1: S\n turn2: U\n turn3: S\n turn4: S\n turn5: S\n turn6: S\n turn7: S\n turn8: S\n turn9: U\n turn10: U\n turn11: U\n turn12: U\n turn13: U\n turn14: U\n turn15: U\n\nLet me verify the positions and collisions:\n\n turn0: action U -> y1 = 0+1 = 1\n  at turn1: y=1 (freeway1) -> check cars on freeway1 at turn1: \n      car1: [37+6,48+6]=[43,54] -> 0 not in\n      car2: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> not\n      car3: [-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18] -> not\n      safe.\n\n turn1: action S -> y2 = 1+0=1\n  at turn2: y=1 (freeway1) -> turn2: \n      car1: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\n      car2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe.\n      car3: [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n turn2: action U -> y3=1+1=2\n  at turn3: y=2 (freeway2) -> turn3: \n      car: [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n turn3: action S -> y4=2+0=2\n  at turn4: freeway2 at turn4: [-83+36*4, -48+36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96] -> safe.\n\n turn4: S -> y5=2\n  at turn5: freeway2 at turn5: [-83+180, -48+180] = [97,132] -> safe.\n\n turn5: S -> y6=2\n  at turn6: freeway2 at turn6: [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe.\n\n turn6: S -> y7=2\n  at turn7: freeway2 at turn7: [169,204] -> safe.\n\n turn7: S -> y8=2\n  at turn8: freeway2 at turn8: [205,240] -> safe.\n\n turn8: S -> y9=2\n  at turn9: freeway2 at turn9: [241,276] -> safe.\n\n turn9: U -> y10=3\n  at turn10: freeway3 -> check at turn10:\n      car1: [-59+6*10, -48+6*10] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n      car2: [-11+60, 0+60] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n      safe.\n\n turn10: U -> y11=4\n  at turn11: freeway4 -> similarly, cars are at:\n      car1: [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] -> safe.\n      car2: [-11+66,0+66] = [55,66] -> safe.\n\n turn11: U -> y12=5\n turn12: U -> y13=6\n turn13: U -> y14=7\n turn14: U -> y15=8\n  at turn15: freeway8 at turn15: \n        car1: [-59+6*15, -48+6*15] = [-59+90, -48+90] = [31,42] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+90, 0+90] = [79,90] -> safe.\n\n turn15: U -> y16=9 -> done.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16.\n\nBut is there a faster way? I think we've exhausted the possibilities.\n\nOne optimization: after turn9, we are at 2. We can do U every turn and get to 9 in 7 moves: turns 9 to 15.\n\nBut can we start the upward move earlier? \n\nFor example, if we are at 2 at turn7, can we move to 3 at turn8? \n  at turn8: if we move to 3, then at turn8 we are at freeway3 -> dangerous! (because freeway3 is dangerous at turn8).\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must wait at turn7 and turn8 at 2.\n\nThen at turn9, we move to 3.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nBut note: in the sequence above, from turn3 to turn8 (6 turns) we are staying at 2. \n\nWe could have been more efficient in the first few turns? \n\nFor example, we did at turn0: U, turn1: S, turn2: U, then from turn3 to turn8: S (6 times) -> that's 6 stays.\n\nWe could have done more up's initially if possible.\n\n turn0: U (1)\n turn1: we cannot do U because then turn2: freeway2 -> collision.\n  so only S or D. D would be to 0.\n  If we do D at turn1: then at turn2:0.\n  then at turn2: U to 1.\n  then at turn3: U to 2. -> then we are at 2 at turn3, same as before.\n\n So the earliest we can be at 2 is turn3.\n\n Then we have to wait at 2 until turn9? that is, from turn3 to turn9: 6 turns? but turn3 we are at 2, and then we wait at turn3,4,5,6,7,8 (6 actions: S) to be at 2 for turns4,5,6,7,8,9. \n But then at turn9: we are at 2 and then we go up.\n\n This is the same as before: \n   turn0: U\n   turn1: D (0)\n   turn2: U (1)\n   turn3: U (2)\n   turn4: S (2)\n   turn5: S (2)\n   turn6: S (2)\n   turn7: S (2)\n   turn8: S (2)\n   turn9: U (3)\n   ... until turn15: U (9)\n\n Still 16 actions.\n\nOr we can do at turn1: S (1), turn2: U (2) -> then at turn3: we are at 2.\n\n Then we wait at turn3 to turn8: 6 actions of S, then turn9:U.\n\n same.\n\n Therefore, the sequence is fixed from turn0 to turn2, and then 6 stays, then 7 ups.\n\n But note: at turn8 we are at 2, and at turn8: we do S -> then at turn9:2. \n then at turn9: U ->3.\n\n So total actions: 16.\n\n So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nNote: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and t1=0.\n\nSo we write Turn 0: U, etc.\n\nThis has 16 actions, and we reach (0,9) at turn16.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 16.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 1. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is moving vertically, and the cars are on horizontal freeways, a collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The x-position is always 0 for the player, so we care about when x=0 is covered by a car on the current freeway.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t_1=1. All cars are moving right, from the direction and the update rule. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], and since it's moving right, head should be greater than tail, so in the notation, for right-moving, it's (head, tail) with head > tail, I think. Let me check the update.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h, I assume. Then at T, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Similarly for left, but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (54,43,right,6) — head=54, tail=43? But 54>43, so if it's right-moving, head should be on the right, so span is from τ=43 to h=54, so [43,54] at t_1.\n\nBut direction is right, so moving right, so at T, position increases.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when x=0 is in the span for the freeway we're on at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that if we move to a different y at turn T, we are not on that new freeway until the next position update, so at turn T, when we decide to move, we are still on the previous y for collision check.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, from the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check for cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThen we take action a_T, which changes y to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo, for collision, only the current freeway matters at the current turn.\n\nNow, we start at turn t_1=1, position y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so we can be there safely.\n\nBut we start at y=1, which has cars, and need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so probably go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's list the car positions over time for each freeway.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and turn T relative to t_1, find if 0 is in the span of any car on k at T.\n\nSince t_1=1, let τ = T - t_1 = T - 1, so time offset.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is [τ_car + s * (T - t_1), h_car + s * (T - t_1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it's (h, τ, d, s) with d=right, and span at t_1 is [τ, h], so at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nNow, x=0 is covered if for some car on k, τ + s(T-t_1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t_1).\n\nSince the car is moving, we need to find T such that this inequality holds.\n\nBut since multiple cars, we need to see for each freeway, at which T, 0 is occupied.\n\nAlso, since the player moves one y per turn, we need to consider for each possible y and turn, whether it's safe.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we should go up quickly, but avoid unsafe positions.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the times when it's unsafe, i.e., when x=0 is covered.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t_1, so at time offset from t_1.\n\nFor freeway k=1:\n\nCars: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nAll speed 6.\n\nFor car1: h=54, τ=43, s=6\n\nSpan at Δt: [43 + 6Δt, 54 + 6Δt]\n\nx=0 covered if 43 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 54 + 6Δt\n\nBut 43 + 6Δt <=0 implies Δt <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, since Δt integer? T is integer turn, I assume.\n\nt_1=1, T integer, so Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 54 + 6Δt always true for Δt >=0? 54+6Δt >=54>0, so 0 <=54+6Δt always true for all Δt.\n\nThen 43+6Δt <=0? 43+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <= -43 => Δt <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, so Δt <= -8 since integer.\n\nΔt <= -8.\n\nBut Δt = T - t_1, T >= t_1=1? We start from t_1, so for future, Δt >=0.\n\nFor Δt >=0, 43+6Δt >=43>0, so 0 < 43+6Δt <= 0 false, so for Δt >=0, this car never covers x=0 because left end is at least 43.\n\nSimilarly, right end 54+6Δt >0 always.\n\nSo car1 never covers x=0 for T >= t_1.\n\nNow car2: (18,7,right,6), so τ=7, h=18, s=6\n\nSpan at Δt: [7 + 6Δt, 18 + 6Δt]\n\nx=0 covered if 7 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 18 + 6Δt\n\n7+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <= -7 => Δt <= -7/6 ≈ -1.166, so Δt <= -2? Since Δt integer, Δt <= -2 for <= -1.166? Δt <= -2.\n\nΔt <= -1: for Δt=-1, 7+6*(-1)=7-6=1>0, not <=0.\n\nΔt <= -2: Δt=-2, 7+6*(-2)=7-12=-5<=0, and 0 <=18+6*(-2)=18-12=6, yes -5<=0<=6.\n\nBut for Δt >=0, 7+6Δt >=7>0, so 7+6Δt <=0 false. Thus for Δt >=0, no cover.\n\nSimilarly, car3: (-18,-29,right,6), τ=-29, h=-18, s=6\n\nSpan: [-29 + 6Δt, -18 + 6Δt]\n\nx=0 covered if -29 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -18 + 6Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= -18 + 6Δt => 6Δt >=18 => Δt >= 3\n\nAnd -29 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 29 => Δt <= 29/6 ≈ 4.833, so Δt <=4\n\nThus for Δt=3,4\n\nFor Δt=3: span [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11, 0], so -11<=0<=0, yes 0 covered.\n\nΔt=4: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔt=5: [-29+30, -18+30] = [1,12], 1<=0? 1>0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <=12 true, but 1 <=0 false? The inequality is left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo for left <=0 and 0<=right.\n\nFor Δt=5: left=1, 1<=0?

So not covered.\n\nOnly Δt=3 and 4.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when Δt=3 or 4, i.e., T= t_1 +3 =4 or T= t_1 +4=5.\n\nt_1=1, so T=4 or 5.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nτ=-47, h=-12, s=36\n\nSpan at Δt: [-47 + 36Δt, -12 + 36Δt]\n\nx=0 covered if -47 + 36Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 36Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= -12 + 36Δt => 36Δt >=12 => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so Δt >=1\n\nAnd -47 + 36Δt <=0 => 36Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so Δt <=1\n\nThus Δt=1\n\nFor Δt=1: span [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11, 24], -11<=0<=24, yes.\n\nΔt=0: span [-47, -12], -47<=0 true, but 0<= -12?

Only Δt=0.\n\nFor Δt=0: span [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nFor Δt<0, not considered.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe at Δt=0 (from second car) and Δt=7,8 (from first car)\n\nΔt=0: T=t_1=1\n\nΔt=7: T=8, Δt=8: T=9\n\nNow similarly, freeway 4 to 8 all have the same cars: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFor each, same as freeway 3.\n\nFor freeway 4,5,6,7,8: all have two cars: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nSo for each, unsafe at Δt=0 and Δt=7,8\n\nThat is, T=t_1=1, and T=8,9\n\nt_1=1.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=4,5\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=3 to 8 all same.\n\ny=1 only at T=4,5; y=2 at T=2; y=3-8 at T=1,8,9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, T=1.\n\nAt T=1, position y=1.\n\nIs y=1 safe at T=1?\n\nFor y=1, unsafe only at T=4 and 5, not at T=1. So at T=1, y=1 is safe.\n\nWe need to choose action a_1.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, go to y=2 at T=2.\n\nIf D, to y=0 at T=2.\n\nIf S, stay y=1 at T=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as fast as possible, so going up is better, but we have to avoid unsafe positions.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nSince we start at y=1, T=1, safe.\n\nWe can go up to y=2 at next turn.\n\nAt T=2, if we are on y=2, is it safe?\n\ny=2 unsafe only at T=2, from above.\n\nAt T=2, y=2 is unsafe because freeway y=2 has car covering x=0 at T=2.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=2 at T=2.\n\nTherefore, at T=1, if we go up to y=2 at T=2, we will be on y=2 at T=2, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we stay, at T=2 we are on y=1.\n\nAt T=2, y=1: is it safe?\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=4,5, not at T=2. So y=1 is safe at T=2.\n\nIf we go down, to y=0 at T=2, which is safe.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we should avoid going down if possible.\n\nBut at T=2, we cannot be on y=2, so options at T=1:\n\n- Action S: stay at y=1 for T=2. Then at T=2, position y=1, which is safe.\n\n- Action D: go down to y=0 at T=2.\n\nBut going down to y=0 might waste time, since we need to go up to 9.\n\n- Action U: to y=2 at T=2, but unsafe, not allowed.\n\nSo only S or D at T=1.\n\nD to y=0, then from y=0, we can only go up to y=1 or stay, but staying at y=0 doesn't help, so probably go up.\n\nBut let's see the minimal path.\n\nSince we cannot go up immediately to y=2 at T=2 because unsafe, we might need to stay or go down temporarily.\n\nBut going down to y=0 might not be efficient.\n\nAt T=1, we take action S, so at T=2, we are still at y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=2, we need to choose action for T=3.\n\nAt T=2, position y=1.\n\nNow, possible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, go to y=2 at T=3.\n\nIf D, to y=0 at T=3.\n\nIf S, stay y=1 at T=3.\n\nNow, at T=3, what is safe?\n\nFirst, y=1 at T=3: unsafe at T=4,5, not T=3, so safe.\n\ny=2 at T=3: y=2 unsafe only at T=2, not at T=3, so safe? y=2 unsafe only at T=2, so at T=3 it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nSo at T=2, we can choose U to go to y=2 at T=3.\n\nOr S to stay, or D to go down.\n\nBut going up is better.\n\nSo let's try to go up.\n\nAt T=2, action U, so at T=3, position y=2.\n\nNow, at T=3, y=2 is safe, as above.\n\nNow, from y=2, we can go to y=3 at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, if we go to y=3, we will be on y=3 at T=4.\n\nNow, is y=3 safe at T=4?\n\ny=3 to 8 unsafe at T=1,8,9. T=4 not in list, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other y except specific times.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=4,5, but we are not on y=1.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nSo y=3 at T=4: since unsafe times are T=1,8,9, T=4 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up.\n\nBut let's list the unsafe times again.\n\nFreeway y=3: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\ny=4: same, T=1,8,9\n\n...\n\ny=8: T=1,8,9\n\ny=1: T=4,5\n\ny=2: T=2\n\nSo at T=4, y=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=5, y=3 should be safe, since not T=1,8,9.\n\nT=5 not unsafe for y=3.\n\nNow, back to T=3, position y=2, safe.\n\nWe take action U, so at T=4, position y=3.\n\nNow at T=4, position y=3, is it safe? Yes, as above.\n\nThen we can take action U to go to y=4 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, if on y=4, is it safe?\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=1,8,9. T=5 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep going up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nNow, what about the unsafe times later? For example, y=3 to 8 unsafe at T=8 and 9.\n\nBut we might reach before that.\n\nLet's see how fast we can go up.\n\nStart: T=1, y=1, safe.\n\nAction at T=1: we decided to take S, so stay at y=1 for T=2? Earlier.\n\nAt T=1, we take action, which affects position at next turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn T=1: position y=1, choose action a_1.\n\nIf a_1 = S, then at T=2, position y=1.\n\nIf a_1 = U, to y=2 at T=2, but y=2 unsafe at T=2, collision, not allowed.\n\nIf a_1 = D, to y=0 at T=2.\n\nBut we took S at T=1.\n\nThen at T=2, position y=1, safe.\n\nNow choose a_2.\n\na_2: U to y=2 at T=3, or S stay y=1, or D to y=0.\n\nTake U, so to y=2 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, position y=2, safe (since unsafe only at T=2).\n\nNow choose a_3: U to y=3 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, position y=3, safe (unsafe at T=1,8,9, not T=4).\n\nNow choose a_4: U to y=4 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, position y=4, safe? y=4 unsafe at T=1,8,9, T=5 not, so safe.\n\na_4 U to y=4 at T=5.\n\nThen a_5: U to y=5 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, position y=5, safe (not unsafe times).\n\nSimilarly, a_6: U to y=6 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, position y=6, safe.\n\na_7: U to y=7 at T=8.\n\nNow at T=8, position y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at T=8! Because y=3 to 8 unsafe at T=8.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at T=8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=7, position y=6, safe.\n\nWe take action a_7 to go to y=7 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at T=8, y=8 also unsafe at T=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=8.\n\nNow, what about going to y=9? y=9 safe.\n\nBut from y=6 at T=7, we can go to y=7 at T=8, but unsafe.\n\nWe can stay or go down.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nUnsafe for y=3-8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8, all y=3 to8 unsafe.\n\nAt T=9, all y=3 to8 unsafe.\n\nNow, at T=7, we are at y=6.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U to y=7 at T=8: unsafe\n\n- S stay y=6 at T=8: but y=6 unsafe at T=8\n\n- D to y=5 at T=8: y=5 unsafe at T=8\n\nAll options to be on y=5,6,7 at T=8 are unsafe.\n\nIf we go down to y=5 at T=8, y=5 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, all levels from 3 to8 unsafe at T=8.\n\nSo we cannot be on any of y=3 to8 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nNow, at T=7, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut whatever action we take, for T=8 position, it will be between y=5,6,7 if we move down, stay, or up, all within 3-8, unsafe at T=8.\n\ny=5,6,7 all part of 3-8.\n\nUnless we can be on y=2 or y=9 or y=0.\n\ny=2: is it safe at T=8?\n\ny=2 unsafe only at T=2, not at T=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe at T=8, since unsafe only T=4,5.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut from y=6 at T=7, we can only move to y=5,6,7 at T=8.\n\nWe cannot reach y=2 or y=9 in one step.\n\ny=9 is too far.\n\nSo at T=8, we must be on y=5,6, or7, all unsafe.\n\nThus, we cannot avoid collision at T=8 if we are on those levels.\n\nBut we need to not be on those levels at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn our current path, at T=7 we are at y=6, which is before, but we get stuck at T=8.\n\nWe need to adjust the path so that at T=8 and T=9, we are not on y=3 to8.\n\nFor example, be on y=2 or y=1 or y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but we might not reach by T=8.\n\nSince we start at T=1, y=1, and we need to go to y=9, minimum 8 steps if we go up each time, but with waiting, it might be more.\n\nIn our earlier path, we arrived at y=6 at T=7, which is after 6 steps? Let's see timeline.\n\nT=1: y=1\n\nAfter action a1 at T=1, position at T=2.\n\nIf we go up step by step:\n\nStart T=1, y=1\n\na1: but we couldn't go up at first.\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\nT=1: a1=S, so at T=2, y=1\n\nT=2: a2=U, to y=2 at T=3\n\nT=3: a3=U, to y=3 at T=4\n\nT=4: a4=U, to y=4 at T=5\n\nT=5: a5=U, to y=5 at T=6\n\nT=6: a6=U, to y=6 at T=7\n\nT=7: a7=?, but at T=8 we need position.\n\nAt T=7, y=6.\n\nThen for T=8, if a7=U, to y=7 at T=8, unsafe\n\na7=S, to y=6 at T=8, unsafe\n\na7=D, to y=5 at T=8, unsafe\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nSo we need to be at a safe position at T=8.\n\nSafe positions at T=8: y=0,1,2,9\n\ny=9 is goal.\n\ny=0,1,2 are lower.\n\nNow, at T=7, we are at y=6, which is not safe for T=8, but we can move to avoid.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=7, we can go down to y=5 at T=8, but unsafe.\n\nOr stay, unsafe.\n\nUp, unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be safe at T=8 from y=6.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y=6 at T=7; we need to be at a position where we can reach a safe y at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=7, if we are at y=1, we can go to y=2 at T=8, which is safe.\n\nOr to y=1 or y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=2, go to y=3, but y=3 unsafe at T=8, or to y=1 or y=2, but y=2 safe at T=8.\n\ny=2 safe at T=8.\n\ny=1 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at T=7, too high.\n\nSo we need to slow down earlier to be lower at T=7.\n\nFor instance, at some point, we stay or go down to be at a lower y when T=8 approaches.\n\nNow, T=8 is critical.\n\nSimilarly, T=9 is also unsafe for y=3-8, but if we can reach y=9 before or at T=8, we are safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut from start, to reach y=9, minimum 8 steps: from y=1 to y=9, 8 up moves.\n\nBut with the initial delay, we are later.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nWe start at T=1, y=1.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn T=1 + (H-1), position y.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=1, so at turn 1 + H -1 = H, position y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=8, at turn 8, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 8, if y=9, safe, but we need to get there.\n\nIn the path, we need to be at lower y earlier.\n\nSince T=8 and T=9 are unsafe for y=3-8, we need to either:\n\n- Be on y=0,1,2 at T=8 and T=9, or\n\n- Be on y=9 by T=8.\n\ny=9 by T=8 is possible if we go up fast.\n\nBut we had a problem at the beginning because we couldn't go up at T=2.\n\nAt T=1, we are at y=1, safe.\n\nIf we could go up immediately, but at T=2, y=2 unsafe, so we had to stay at T=1.\n\nThen at T=2, we went up to y=2 at T=3.\n\nT=3 y=2, then to y=3 at T=4, and so on, to y=6 at T=7.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=8, we need from y=6 at T=7 to go up three times? No, from T=7 to T=8, one action, can only change by 1.\n\nAt T=7, position y=6, after action, position at T=8.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=8, we need to be at y=8 at T=7, then U to y=9 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=7, if we are at y=8, is it safe?\n\ny=8 at T=7: unsafe times T=1,8,9, not T=7, so safe.\n\nThen at T=7, position y=8, safe.\n\nThen a7=U to y=9 at T=8, safe.\n\nBut in our path, at T=7 we are at y=6, not y=8.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at T=7?\n\nFrom start, we need to go up faster.\n\nBut at the beginning, we were delayed.\n\nAt T=1, we are at y=1.\n\nIf we go up at T=1, to y=2 at T=2, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo we must stay or go down at T=1.\n\nWe stayed at T=1, so at T=2 y=1.\n\nThen at T=2, we went up to y=2 at T=3.\n\nT=3 y=2.\n\nThen to y=3 at T=4, T=4 y=3.\n\nT=5 y=4, T=6 y=5, T=7 y=6.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=7, we need to be at y=7 at T=6, for example.\n\nBut at T=6, if y=7, is it safe? y=7 unsafe at T=1,8,9, not T=6, safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=7 at T=6.\n\nFrom T=1 y=1.\n\nT=1: if we could go up, but can't.\n\nPerhaps go down first to avoid the initial issue, but that might be slower.\n\nAnother idea: at T=1, go down to y=0 at T=2.\n\nThen from there, we can go up freely, but we are lower.\n\nLet's see.\n\nPath 1: start T=1 y=1\n\na1 = D, to y=0 at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a2 = U, to y=1 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, safe (unsafe only T=4,5)\n\na3 = U, to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2: y=2 unsafe only at T=2, not T=4, so safe.\n\na4 = U, to y=3 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=3: unsafe times T=1,8,9, not T=5, safe.\n\na5 = U, to y=4 at T=6.\n\nT=6 y=4, safe.\n\na6 = U, to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7 y=5, safe.\n\na7 = U, to y=6 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6, unsafe! Because y=6 unsafe at T=8.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAt T=7, y=5, we need to avoid being on y=3-8 at T=8.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=7, we can go down to y=4 at T=8, but unsafe, or to y=5, unsafe, or to y=6, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at T=7 we are at y=2, for example, we can go to y=3 but unsafe, or stay y=2 safe, or down to y=1 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=5.\n\nSo need to be lower earlier.\n\nTo avoid T=8 and T=9, we can be on y=2 at T=8.\n\ny=2 safe at T=8.\n\nThen at T=9, we can go to y=3, but y=3 unsafe at T=9, so we need to stay or go to safe level.\n\nOr go directly to y=9 if possible.\n\nBut let's plan the path to be at a safe position at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example, at T=8, be on y=2.\n\nThen at T=9, be on y=2 or y=1 or y=0 or go to y=3, but y=3 unsafe at T=9, so cannot.\n\nSo at T=9, we can be on y=2, safe, or y=1, or y=0, or y=9.\n\ny=9 is good.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=8, we can go U to y=3 at T=9, but unsafe, or S to y=2, safe, or D to y=1, safe.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9, so staying low is not progress.\n\nWe can go to y=9 later.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we should go up when possible.\n\nSince T=8 and T=9 are bad for y=3-8, we can wait at y=2 for those turns.\n\nThen after T=9, we can go up.\n\ny=2 is safe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe.\n\nNow, let's find how to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nFrom start, T=1 y=1.\n\nWe need to control the position over time.\n\nAt T=1, position y=1.\n\nWe take action a1.\n\nOptions: S or D (U not possible)\n\nIf a1=S, at T=2 y=1\n\nThen at T=2, we can take a2: U, S, D\n\nIf a2=U, to y=2 at T=3\n\nIf a2=S, to y=1 at T=3\n\nIf a2=D, to y=0 at T=3\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe want to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nSince we start at y=1 T=1, to be at y=2 at T=8, that means in 7 turns from T=1 to T=8, we move from y=1 to y=2, so net up by 1, with some actions.\n\nLet nU be number of U, nD number of D, nS number of S.\n\nThen change in y: nU - nD = 2 - 1 =1\n\nTotal turns: nU + nD + nS =7 (from T=1 to T=8, 7 actions: a1 to a7, position at T=8 after a7)\n\nPosition at T=8 depends on actions from t=1 to t=7.\n\nActions at t=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 determine position at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, start at T=1 y=1.\n\nAfter 7 actions, position at T=8.\n\ny_T = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=1 to T-1? Let's clarify.\n\nPosition at turn T is after actions up to T-1.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAction at turn T changes to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for position at T, it is determined by actions at turns 1 to T-1.\n\nAt turn 1, position y_1 =1.\n\nAfter action a1, position at turn 2: y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\nAfter a2, y3 = y2 + Δy2, and so on.\n\nSo after action at turn k, position at turn k+1.\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T.\n\nFor turn 8, y8.\n\ny8 depends on actions a1 to a7.\n\ny8 = y1 + sum_{t=1 to 7} Δy_t\n\ny1=1\n\nΔy_t = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S.\n\nSo y8 = 1 + (number of U minus number of D from t=1 to7)\n\nSimilarly, the number of actions is 7 for a1 to a7.\n\nLet U7 be number of U in first 7 actions, D7 number of D, S7 number of S.\n\nU7 + D7 + S7 =7\n\ny8 = 1 + U7 - D7\n\nWe want y8 =2, for example.\n\nSo 1 + U7 - D7 =2 => U7 - D7 =1\n\nAlso, U7 + D7 + S7 =7\n\nNow, similarly, for other points.\n\nBut we also need to ensure safety at each step.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we might not want to be at y=2 at T=8, but rather reach y=9 before T=8 if possible.\n\nBut with the initial constraint, it might not be possible to reach before T=8.\n\nMinimum turns to reach y=9: if no cars, we could go up 8 times in 8 turns: from T=1 y=1, after 8 actions, at T=9 y=9, for example.\n\nBut let's see the earliest possible.\n\nStart T=1 y=1.\n\nAction a1: cannot U, so must S or D.\n\nIf S, at T=2 y=1.\n\nThen a2: can U to y=2 at T=3.\n\nThen a3: U to y=3 at T=4\n\na4: U to y=4 at T=5\n\na5: U to y=5 at T=6\n\na6: U to y=6 at T=7\n\na7: U to y=7 at T=8 but unsafe, or if we could go to y=8 at T=8, but from y=6 at T=7, U to y=7 at T=8, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=8, we need at T=7 to be at y=7, then U to y=8 at T=8, but y=8 unsafe at T=8.\n\nOr to y=9 at T=8, need at T=7 to be at y=8, then U to y=9 at T=8.\n\nAt T=7, if y=8, safe, then a7=U to y=9 at T=8, safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at T=7.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at T=7.\n\nFrom start, with 6 actions: a1 to a6, position at T=7.\n\ny7 = 1 + sum_{t=1 to6} Δy_t\n\nWant y7=8.\n\n1 + U6 - D6 =8 => U6 - D6 =7\n\nBut U6 + D6 + S6 =6\n\nU6 - D6 =7, U6 + D6 <=6, impossible since U6 <=6, U6 - D6 <=6 <7.\n\nSo cannot be at y=8 at T=7.\n\nMaximum y at T=7: from y=1, with 6 actions, all U, y7=1+6=7.\n\nWith a1 to a6, if all U, y7=1+6=7.\n\nThen at T=7, y=7.\n\nThen a7=U to y=8 at T=8, but y=8 unsafe at T=8.\n\na7=S to y=7 at T=8, unsafe.\n\na7=D to y=6 at T=8, unsafe.\n\nNo good.\n\nIf we go down at some point, y lower, worse.\n\nSo it is impossible to reach y=9 by T=8 or to be on a safe y at T=8 from the path.\n\nBut we can be on y=2 at T=8.\n\nFor example, to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\ny8 =1 + U7 - D7 =2, so U7 - D7 =1\n\nU7 + D7 + S7 =7\n\nPossible, for example, U7=4, D7=3, S7=0, or U7=2, D7=1, S7=4, etc.\n\nBut we need to ensure that during the path, we don't have collision.\n\nAlso, at T=9, we need to be safe.\n\nSince T=9 is also unsafe for y=3-8, we need to be on safe y at T=9 as well.\n\nAfter T=9, we can go up.\n\nFirst, let's aim to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, position y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, we choose action a8.\n\nWe can stay at y=2 for T=9, safe.\n\nOr go down to y=1, safe.\n\nOr go up to y=3 at T=9, but y=3 unsafe at T=9, collision.\n\nSo we cannot go up to y=3 at T=9.\n\nSo at T=8, we must take S or D to be on y=2 or y=1 at T=9.\n\nSay, take S, so at T=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen after T=9, we can go up.\n\nT=9, position y=2, safe.\n\nThen a9: U to y=3 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=3: unsafe times T=1,8,9, not T=10, so safe.\n\nThen a10: U to y=4 at T=11, safe, and so on, up to y=9.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible before T=8 and after T=9.\n\nBut before T=8, we need to be at y=2 at T=8, so we can't go too high.\n\nFor example, from T=1 to T=8, we start at y=1, end at y=2, so net up 1, so we must have some down or stay to not go higher.\n\nSince U7 - D7 =1, and U7 + D7 + S7 =7.\n\nMinimal actions: to have net up 1 with few moves, but we have to fill 7 actions.\n\nWe can have, for example, 1 U, 0 D, 6 S, then y8=1 +1 -0=2, but with 6 stays, it takes time.\n\nOr 2 U, 1 D, 4 S, y8=1+2-1=2, etc.\n\nBut we need to avoid unsafe positions during the path.\n\nAlso, at the beginning, we have the y=2 unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nStart T=1 y=1, safe.\n\nAt T=1, we must take S or D.\n\nSuppose we take S, so at T=2 y=1, safe.\n\nAt T=2, we can take action.\n\nWe want to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nAt T=2, y=1.\n\nWe can take U to go to y=2 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=2, safe (since not T=2).\n\nThen from here, we need to stay around or go down to not increase y too much, to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nFor example, from T=3 to T=8, 5 actions: a3 to a7, position at T=8.\n\ny at T=3 is 2.\n\ny8 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t = 2 + U_{3-7} - D_{3-7}\n\nWant y8=2, so U_{3-7} - D_{3-7} =0\n\nThus equal number of U and D, or all S.\n\nFor example, all S from T=3 to T=7, but that's 5 stays, then at T=8 y=2.\n\nBut during, at each turn, we need to be safe.\n\nAt T=3, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a3=S, at T=4 y=2.\n\nAt T=4, y=2: is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at T=2, not T=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=5 y=2, safe, etc., up to T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, we are at y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, we take a8=S, to stay at y=2 for T=9, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, position y=2, safe.\n\nNow we can start going up.\n\na9: U to y=3 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=3, safe (not unsafe times).\n\na10: U to y=4 at T=11, safe.\n\na11: U to y=5 at T=12, safe.\n\na12: U to y=6 at T=13, safe.\n\na13: U to y=7 at T=14, safe.\n\na14: U to y=8 at T=15, safe.\n\na15: U to y=9 at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, y=9, goal.\n\nH is the number of actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=1 to t=15, position at t=16 is y=9.\n\nt from t1=1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position=9.\n\nHere t1=1, at turn 16, position=9, so t1+H-1=16, so 1+H-1=16, H=16.\n\nBut we can reduce by not staying so much.\n\nFor example, at T=3, we are at y=2, instead of staying, we can go down and up to kill time but be at y=2 later.\n\nBut that might not save turns.\n\nSince we need to be at y=2 at T=8, and we are at y=2 at T=3, we can go down to y=1 or y=0 and come back, but that takes more actions.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=2, take D to y=1 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen we can stay or go up.\n\nBut we need y=2 at T=8.\n\nSo from T=4 y=1, we can go to y=2 at some point.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nSince we have to wait until after T=9, we can go up to a higher y before T=8, but not above y=2? y=2 is safe, but y=3-8 unsafe at T=8, so we must be below or at y=2 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nSo the highest we can be at T=8 is y=2.\n\nSo to reach y=9 faster, we should be as high as possible before, but constrained to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nFor example, from T=1 to T=3, we can be at y=2 at T=3.\n\nThen from T=3 to T=8, 5 turns, we need to end at y=2, so net zero change, so we can have some downs and ups, but to save time, we can stay at y=2 for those 5 turns, as above.\n\nIf we go down and up, we use extra actions for no gain.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at T=3, go D to y=1 at T=4, then U to y=2 at T=5, etc., but then we have more actions, and we still end at y=2 at T=8, but it takes the same or more turns.\n\nSo minimal is to stay put from T=3 to T=8.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut at T=8, we take S to stay for T=9.\n\nThen from T=9 to go to y=9, we need 7 up moves from y=2 to y=9.\n\nFrom T=9 position y=2, after actions, to reach y=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, take U to y=3 at T=10, and so on, to U at T=15 to y=9 at T=16.\n\nAs before.\n\nH=15 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=15, position at t=16.\n\nt1+H-1=16, H=16.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nAnother idea: at T=1, instead of staying, go down to y=0 at T=2.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=1 at T=3, y=1 safe.\n\nThen to y=2 at T=4, y=2 safe at T=4.\n\nThen we need to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nFrom T=4 y=2, to T=8, 4 actions: a4 to a7, position at T=8.\n\ny8 = y4 + sum_{t=4 to7} Δy_t =2 + U_{4-7} - D_{4-7} =2, so U-D=0.\n\nSo we can stay or have equal U and D.\n\nFor example, all S from T=4 to T=7, at T=8 y=2.\n\nThen same as before, but we started lower, so from T=2 to T=4 we have two actions to go from y=0 to y=2, which is faster than staying at y=1.\n\nIn the first path, at T=1 we stayed, so at T=2 y=1, then to y=2 at T=3.\n\nHere, at T=1 we go D to y=0 at T=2, then U to y=1 at T=3, U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nSo at T=4 we are at y=2, whereas in first path at T=3 we are at y=2.\n\nBut we need to be at y=2 at T=8, so from T=4 to T=8, we stay for 4 turns, position at T=8 y=2.\n\nThen from there, same as before to go up.\n\nBut at T=4 we are at y=2, and we stay until T=8, so at T=8 y=2.\n\nThen a8=S to stay for T=9 y=2.\n\nThen from T=9 y=2, go up to y=3 at T=10, ..., to y=9 at T=16.\n\nSame as before, 16 turns.\n\nBut in this case, from T=1 to T=4, we used 3 actions to be at y=2, whereas in first path, with a1=S, a2=U, at T=3 y=2 with 2 actions.\n\nIn first path: T=1 action S, T=2 action U, position at T=3 y=2.\n\n2 actions for from T=1 to T=3.\n\nIn second path: T=1 action D, T=2 action U (to y=1), T=3 action U to y=2 at T=4, 3 actions to T=4 y=2.\n\nSlower.\n\nSo first way better: at T=1 S, T=2 U, to y=2 at T=3.\n\nThen stay from T=3 to T=8 with S actions.\n\nActions at T=3,4,5,6,7 all S, position at T=4,5,6,7,8 all y=2.\n\nAt T=8 y=2.\n\nThen action at T=8 S, to stay for T=9 y=2.\n\nThen action at T=9 U, to y=3 at T=10\n\nT=10 U to y=4 at T=11\n\nT=11 U to y=5 at T=12\n\nT=12 U to y=6 at T=13\n\nT=13 U to y=7 at T=14\n\nT=14 U to y=8 at T=15\n\nT=15 U to y=9 at T=16\n\nNow, at T=16 y=9, so turn t1+H-1=16, t1=1, so H-1=15, H=16.\n\nBut we can reduce the number of stays.\n\nFor example, at T=3 we are at y=2.\n\nInstead of staying until T=8, we can go down to y=1 or y=0 and come back at T=8 to y=2.\n\nBut that requires more actions.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=2, take D to y=1 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=1, take U to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=2, take D to y=1 at T=6, U to y=2 at T=7, etc., but we have two actions for each cycle, whereas staying is one action per turn.\n\nSo to spend 5 turns from T=3 to T=8, staying uses 5 actions, moving down and up uses at least 2 actions for one down-up, but we need to be at y=2 at T=8, so it might not save.\n\nSince U-D=0 for the sum, we can have some S, but adding U and D doesn't help.\n\nSo minimal is to stay.\n\nBut at the beginning, we have to deal with T=1.\n\nAnother point: at T=1, we could go down to y=0.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0.\n\nThen we can go up to y=1 at T=3, etc.\n\nBut similar.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 faster by being at a safe position at T=8 and then going up quickly after.\n\nSince T=9 is also unsafe, we need to wait until T=10 to start going up from a low position.\n\nBut in the above, we start going up from T=9 position y=2.\n\nT=9 action to T=10.\n\nBut at T=9 we are at y=2, safe.\n\nThen we go up each turn to T=16.\n\nBut the unsafe times are only T=8 and T=9 for the middle freeways.\n\nAfter T=9, no more unsafe times, so we can go up freely.\n\nTo save turns, we should be as high as possible at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, we can be on y=2, as above.\n\nCan we be higher? y=3-8 unsafe at T=9, so only y=0,1,2,9.\n\ny=9 is goal, but we can't reach by T=9 probably.\n\nMaximum at T=9: start from y=1 T=1, with 8 actions a1 to a8, position at T=9.\n\ny9 =1 + U8 - D8\n\nU8 + D8 + S8 =8\n\nMax y9=1+8=9 if all U, but we cannot because of cars.\n\nFor example, to go all up, but at T=2, y=2 unsafe, so we can't go up at T=1.\n\nIf we go S at T=1, U at T=2 to y=2 at T=3, then U at T=3 to y=3 at T=4, ..., U at T=7 to y=7 at T=8, but at T=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we could be at y=8 at T=8, but as before, impossible.\n\ny9 min or max.\n\nBut at T=9, to be safe, y=0,1,2,9.\n\ny=9 possible only if we can reach by T=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=9, we need to be at y=8 at T=8, then U to y=9 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=8, y=8 unsafe, so we cannot be on y=8 at T=8 to take the action.\n\nIf we are on y=8 at T=8, collision, so we can't take action.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=9 at T=9, we need position at T=9 after actions.\n\nBut if we are on y=8 at T=8, unsafe, we collide before taking action.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 at T=8 or y=9 at T=9 if it requires being on unsafe position.\n\nThe only safe at T=9 are y=0,1,2.\n\nSo we must be on one of them at T=9.\n\nSimilarly at T=8.\n\nSo the earliest we can reach y=9 is after T=9.\n\nFor example, at T=10, if we are on y=3, then we can go up to y=9 by T=16, but if we are higher at T=10.\n\nAt T=9, we are at y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, we take U to y=3 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can go up each turn to y=9 at T=16.\n\nBut from T=10 y=3 to T=16 y=9, 6 up moves, 6 turns.\n\nT=10 to T=16 is 6 actions? Position at T=10 after action at T=9.\n\nAction at T=9 to position at T=10.\n\nThen action at T=10 to T=11, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=16, as before.\n\nBut we can be at a higher y at T=10.\n\nAt T=9, we are at y=2.\n\nIf at T=9 we take U, to y=3 at T=10.\n\nBut we can take multiple actions, but one per turn.\n\nSo y at T=10 is at most y=3.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=16.\n\nMinimal H is 16.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can save a turn.\n\nSuppose at T=8, we are at y=2, safe.\n\nInstead of staying at T=8, we can go down to y=1 at T=9, but that is lower, worse.\n\nOr stay.\n\nThen at T=9, go U to y=3 at T=10.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so from T=9 to T=16, 7 turns.\n\nT=9 action to T=10 y=3, T=10 to T=11 y=4, ..., T=15 to T=16 y=9.\n\nSo actions from t=1 to t=15, position at t=16.\n\nH=16.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have many stays.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster before T=8 to be at y=2 at T=8 but with less stay.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=2.\n\nThen instead of staying, we go down to y=1 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen we can stay at y=1 for some turns, but we need to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nSo at T=7, we need to be at y=1 or y=2 or y=3 to reach y=2 at T=8.\n\nIf at T=7 y=1, then a7=U to y=2 at T=8.\n\nIf at T=7 y=2, a7=S to y=2 at T=8.\n\nIf at T=7 y=3, a7=D to y=2 at T=8.\n\nAll possible.\n\nBut to be at higher y at T=7, we can go up earlier.\n\nFor example, from T=3 y=2, we can go U to y=3 at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, y=3: unsafe times T=1,8,9, not T=4, so safe.\n\nThen at T=4, y=3, we can go U to y=4 at T=5, safe, U to y=5 at T=6, safe, U to y=6 at T=7, safe.\n\nThen at T=7, y=6.\n\nThen to be at y=2 at T=8, we need to go down, a7=D to y=5 at T=8, but y=5 unsafe at T=8.\n\nOr to y=6 or y=7, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=2 at T=8 from y=6 at T=7.\n\nIf we are at y=1 at T=7, then a7=U to y=2 at T=8.\n\nOr at y=2 at T=7, S to y=2 at T=8.\n\nOr at y=3 at T=7, D to y=2 at T=8.\n\nBut from above, at T=7 we can be at y=6, but we need to be at y=1,2, or 3.\n\nSo we must not go too high before T=8.\n\nSo to be at y=3 at T=7, for example.\n\nThen a7=D to y=2 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=7, y=3 is safe, since not unsafe times.\n\nThen a7=D to y=2 at T=8, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, we can take a8=S to y=2 at T=9, safe.\n\nThen a9=U to y=3 at T=10, and so on.\n\nBut now, at T=7 we are at y=3, which is higher than before, so when we go up after, we save one turn.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nT=1: start y=1, a1=S, so at T=2 y=1\n\nT=2: a2=U, to y=2 at T=3\n\nT=3: a3=U, to y=3 at T=4  (since safe)\n\nT=4: a4=U, to y=4 at T=5\n\nT=5: a5=U, to y=5 at T=6\n\nT=6: a6=U, to y=6 at T=7\n\nAt T=7, y=6, safe.\n\nBut we need to be at lower for T=8.\n\na6 to y=6 at T=7.\n\nThen a7: to go to y=2 at T=8, we need to go down 4 steps, but we can only change by 1 per action, so to y=5 at T=8, but y=5 unsafe.\n\nNot possible to reach y=2 from y=6 in one action.\n\nMaximum down to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at T=8.\n\nSo from y=6 at T=7, we can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=8, all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at T=7 if we want to be safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, we must be at y=1 or 2 or 3 at T=7 to reach a safe position at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=7, be at y=1, then a7=U to y=2 at T=8\n\nOr at y=2, a7=S to y=2 at T=8\n\nOr at y=3, a7=D to y=2 at T=8\n\nOr at y=0, a7=U to y=1 at T=8, but y=1 safe at T=8? y=1 unsafe at T=4,5, not T=8, so safe, but then at T=8 y=1, which is safe, but we want to be at y=2 to be higher.\n\nBut y=1 is also safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nBut to be higher, y=2 is better.\n\nSo at T=7, we should be at y=1,2, or3.\n\nNow, to be at y=3 at T=7, for example.\n\nFrom start, how to reach y=3 at T=7.\n\nT=1 y=1\n\na1: must S or D, say S, to y=1 at T=2\n\na2: U to y=2 at T=3\n\na3: U to y=3 at T=4\n\nThen from T=4 y=3, to T=7 y=3, so we can stay or move but end at y=3.\n\nFor example, a4=S to y=3 at T=5\n\na5=S to y=3 at T=6\n\na6=S to y=3 at T=7\n\nThen at T=7, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a7=D to y=2 at T=8, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a8=S to y=2 at T=9, safe.\n\nThen a9=U to y=3 at T=10\n\na10=U to y=4 at T=11\n\na11=U to y=5 at T=12\n\na12=U to y=6 at T=13\n\na13=U to y=7 at T=14\n\na14=U to y=8 at T=15\n\na15=U to y=9 at T=16\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=7 y=3, then a7=D to y=2 at T=8, then a8=U to y=3 at T=9, but y=3 unsafe at T=9, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo at T=8, after a7, position y=2.\n\nThen at T=8, we take a8, to position at T=9.\n\nIf we take U, to y=3 at T=9, but y=3 unsafe at T=9.\n\nS to y=2 at T=9, safe.\n\nD to y=1 at T=9, safe.\n\nSo we must take S or D at T=8 to be on safe y at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, we can go U to y=3 at T=10, etc.\n\nNo savings.\n\nSo H=16 seems the minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions for this sequence:\n\nTurn t=1: S  (position at T=2 y=1)\n\nTurn t=2: U  (T=3 y=2)\n\nTurn t=3: U  (T=4 y=3)\n\nTurn t=4: S  (T=5 y=3)  // staying at y=3\n\nTurn t=5: S  (T=6 y=3)\n\nTurn t=6: S  (T=7 y=3)\n\nTurn t=7: D  (T=8 y=2)  // down to y=2 at T=8\n\nTurn t=8: S  (T=9 y=2)  // stay for T=9\n\nTurn t=9: U  (T=10 y=3)\n\nTurn t=10: U (T=11 y=4)\n\nTurn t=11: U (T=12 y=5)\n\nTurn t=12: U (T=13 y=6)\n\nTurn t=13: U (T=14 y=7)\n\nTurn t=14: U (T=15 y=8)\n\nTurn t=15: U (T=16 y=9)\n\nAt T=16 y=9, so H=15 actions? Actions from t=1 to t=15, 15 actions.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H -1 =1 + H -1 =H.\n\nAt turn H, position=9.\n\nHere at turn 16, position=9, so H=16.\n\nt1 + H -1 =16, 1 + H -1=16, H=16.\n\nNumber of actions is H, from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=1 to t=15, 15 actions, position at t=16.\n\nt=16 is turn number, position at that turn.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is t=16.\n\nSo H such that turn t1 + H -1 =16, t1=1, so H-1=15, H=16.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nSince at T=1, we are at y=1, and we need to be at safe position at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=9, we can be on y=2, then go up.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so from T=9 to T=16, 7 turns after T=9 position.\n\nPosition at T=9 is y=2, after action at T=9, position at T=10 y=3, ..., at T=16 y=9.\n\nSo the turn when position is 9 is T=16.\n\nIf we can be at y=1 at T=9, then to y=9 at T=17, worse.\n\nOr at y=0, worse.\n\nSo y=2 at T=9 is best.\n\nAnd to reach y=2 at T=9 from start.\n\nBut we also have to be safe at T=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have H=16.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier after T=2.\n\nAnother idea: at T=1, go down to y=0 at T=2.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0, a2=U to y=1 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, a3=U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, a4=U to y=3 at T=5, safe.\n\nThen we need to be at safe position at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=5 y=3, we can go down to y=2 at T=6, etc., but similar.\n\nI think H=16 is the minimal.\n\nSo for the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence I have, at turn t=7, we go down to y=2 at T=8.\n\nBut let's make sure all positions are safe.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- T=1: y=1, safe\n\n- T=2: y=1, safe (after a1=S)\n\n- T=3: y=2, safe\n\n- T=4: y=3, safe\n\n- T=5: y=3, safe\n\n- T=6: y=3, safe\n\n- T=7: y=3, safe\n\n- T=8: y=2, safe (after a7=D)\n\n- T=9: y=2, safe (after a8=S)\n\n- T=10: y=3, safe\n\n- T=11: y=4, safe\n\n- T=12: y=5, safe\n\n- T=13: y=6, safe\n\n- T=14: y=7, safe\n\n- T=15: y=8, safe\n\n- T=16: y=9, goal\n\nAll safe.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nH=15 actions? Let's list the turns for actions.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=1 to t=15.\n\nThe position is reached at turn 16.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=1, H=16, so actions from t=1 to t=16? No.\n\nt1 + H -1 =16, so actions from t=1 to t=16? No.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, t=0, a_{t1}, t=1, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThen position after these actions is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut it says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn T = t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from time t1 to t1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nAfter the last action at t1 + H -1, position at turn (t1 + H -1) +1? No.\n\nThe action at time t determines the position at time t+1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, then action a_t, then position at turn t+1 is y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y.\n\nSo after action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nTo have position at turn T be 9, that means after the action at turn T-1, position at turn T is 9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for reaching at turn t1 + H -1 =9, that means position at turn T= t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nThis is achieved by actions from turn t1 to turn (t1 + H -1) -1? Let's see.\n\nPosition at turn T is determined by actions from turn 1 to T-1 for T>1.\n\nFor turn T, y_T depends on a_{1} to a_{T-1} if starting from turn 1.\n\nSpecifically, for turn T, y_T = y_1 + sum_{k=1}^{T-1} Delta y_k\n\nTo have y_T =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn T= t1 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nWith y_1=1.\n\nSo 1 + sum_{k=1}^{T-1} Delta y_k =9\n\nBut T = t1 + H -1 =1 + H -1 =H\n\nSo at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nThen 1 + sum_{k=1}^{H-1} Delta y_k =9\n\nSo sum_{k=1}^{H-1} Delta y_k =8\n\nSince each U contributes +1, etc.\n\nThe actions are from k=1 to H-1, total H-1 actions.\n\nThen position at turn H is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is {a_t for t=t1 to t=t1 + H -2}? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nWhen t=0, a_{t1}, t=1, a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these actions, position at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nSo there is a mismatch.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nFrom the text: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAfter applying actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9, that must be before the actions or something.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose at turn t1, position is given.\n\nThen action a_{t1} determines position at turn t1+1.\n\nAction a_{t1+1} determines position at turn t1+2.\n\n...\n\nAction a_{t1 + k} determines position at turn t1 + k +1.\n\nTo have position at turn T = t1 + H -1 be 9.\n\nThat means that after the action at turn T-1, position at turn T is 9.\n\nSince action at turn t determines position at t+1.\n\nFor turn T, it is determined by action at turn T-1.\n\nSo for position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9, it is determined by action at turn (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2.\n\nThe actions from t1 to t1 + H -2 determine position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nThen the sequence should be actions from t1 to t1 + H -2, total H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence given is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which is from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, that's H actions, which would determine position up to turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for that, the action a_{t1 + H -1} is not needed; it determines position at turn t1 + H.\n\nSo there is a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is off.\n\nIn the game dynamics, at turn t, the player takes action a_t, which updates position to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 for T= t1 + H -1.\n\nThis y_T is set by a_{T-1}.\n\nSo a_{T-1} is the last action that affects y_T.\n\nSince T = t1 + H -1, so a_{t1 + H -2} determines y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThe actions from t1 to t1 + H -2 are the relevant ones for reaching y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut the sequence is specified as {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which includes a_{t1 + H -1}, which is for position at t1 + H, which is after the reach turn.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the task description or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps \"turn t1 + H -1\" is the turn when position is reached, and the actions are from t1 to t1 + H -1, but that would mean H actions determine position at turn t1 + H, not t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's read the task again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFrom the action sequence, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1+H-1, position at turn (t1+H-1) +1 = t1+H.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo for position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9, it must be that no action is taken at that turn or something.\n\nI think it's inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the reach turn is after the actions.\n\nI think for simplicity, in the context, the position at turn T is before taking action, and action at T determines next position.\n\nBut in the reach, at turn t1+H-1, position is 9, which is set by previous actions.\n\nSo the last action that affects it is at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo the actions are from t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nBut the sequence is given as up to a_{t1+H-1}, which is one more.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, it includes the action at the reach turn, but that action doesn't affect the position at that turn.\n\nI think there's confusion.\n\nTo resolve, in the answer format, they specify \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., up to the action before the reach turn.\n\nIn the example, if H is the number such that at turn t1+H-1, position is 9, then actions from t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn t1, position should be 9, but we start at y=1, not 9, so H>1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t1, then position at turn t1+1 should be 9.\n\nWith one action, from y=1 to y=9, impossible.\n\nSo for our case, with H=16, at turn 16, position is 9.\n\nThen the actions are from t=1 to t=15, which is 15 actions.\n\nThe sequence {a_t for t=1 to 15} corresponds to t from 0 to 14 in the index, but in the format, it should be listed as Turn 1: a1, Turn 2: a2, ..., Turn 15: a15.\n\nThen position at turn 16 is 9.\n\nAnd t1 + H -1 =1+16-1=16, correct.\n\nThe sequence has H-1 actions? No, for H=16, we have 15 actions, but H is the number of turns, which includes the start turn or something.\n\nI think it's better to go with the practical.\n\nIn the sequence I have, with 15 actions, position at turn 16 is 9.\n\nSo H=16, and actions from turn 1 to 15.\n\nIn the sequence indexing, {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} for H=16, t from 0 to 15, a_{1+0} to a_{1+15} = a1 to a16, which is 16 actions, but we only need 15.\n\n a16 would be for position at turn 17.\n\nBut we don't need that.\n\nSo the sequence should be for t from 0 to H-2, I think, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps for the reach at turn t1+H-1, the actions are from t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nThen the sequence has H-1 actions.\n\nBut in the format, it says {t=0}^{H-1}, which is H actions.\n\nI think there's an error in the problem statement.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll provide the sequence as per the practical.\n\nIn the answer, for H=16, list actions from turn 1 to turn 15.\n\nAnd in the box, list Turn 1: a1, Turn 2: a2, ..., Turn 15: a15.\n\nWith the actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 7, we have D, which is down, but we are at y=3, down to y=2, which is fine.\n\nTo make it with less down, but in this case, it's necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: at T=1, a1=S, T=2 y=1\n\na2=U, T=3 y=2\n\nThen from T=3 to T=8, stay at y=2: a3=S, a4=S, a5=S, a6=S, a7=S, so at T=4 to T=8 y=2.\n\nThen a8=S, T=9 y=2\n\na9=U, T=10 y=3\n\n...\n\na15=U, T=16 y=9\n\nSame number.\n\nOr at T=7, instead of S, we can do something else, but no benefit.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nH=16.\n\nIn the action list, up to turn 15.\n\nFor the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 16. This means the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 1 + 16 - 1 = 16\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=1}^{15}\\) (from turn 1 to turn 15) ensures the player avoids all collisions and reaches the goal at turn 16. The actions are determined based on the car positions and their movement over time, ensuring that at each turn, the player is not on a freeway where a car occupies \\(x=0\\) at that turn.\n\n- At turn 1, the player starts at \\(y=1\\), which is safe since freeway 1 is unsafe only at turns 4 and 5.\n- Actions are chosen to progress upward when possible but avoid unsafe positions at turns 8 and 9 for freeways \\(y=3\\) to \\(y=8\\), and at other specific unsafe times.\n- The sequence includes stays (S) and one down (D) to position the player at \\(y=2\\) at turns 8 and 9, which is safe, before proceeding upward to \\(y=9\\) after turn 9.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 1: Stay (S), moving to \\(y=1\\) at turn 2 (safe, as \\(y=1\\) unsafe only at turns 4 and 5).\n- Turn 2: Up (U), moving to \\(y=2\\) at turn 3 (safe, as \\(y=2\\) unsafe only at turn 2).\n- Turn 3: Up (U), moving to \\(y=3\\) at turn 4 (safe, as \\(y=3\\) unsafe only at turns 1, 8, and 9).\n- Turn 4: Stay (S), remaining at \\(y=3\\) at turn 5 (safe).\n- Turn 5: Stay (S), remaining at \\(y=3\\) at turn 6 (safe).\n- Turn 6: Stay (S), remaining at \\(y=3\\) at turn 7 (safe).\n- Turn 7: Down (D), moving to \\(y=2\\) at turn 8 (safe, as \\(y=2\\) unsafe only at turn 2).\n- Turn 8: Stay (S), remaining at \\(y=2\\) at turn 9 (safe).\n- Turn 9: Up (U), moving to \\(y=3\\) at turn 10 (safe, as unsafe times for \\(y=3\\) are past).\n- Turn 10: Up (U), moving to \\(y=4\\) at turn 11 (safe).\n- Turn 11: Up (U), moving to \\(y=5\\) at turn 12 (safe).\n- Turn 12: Up (U), moving to \\(y=6\\) at turn 13 (safe).\n- Turn 13: Up (U), moving to \\(y=7\\) at turn 14 (safe).\n- Turn 14: Up (U), moving to \\(y=8\\) at turn 15 (safe).\n- Turn 15: Up (U), moving to \\(y=9\\) at turn 16 (goal reached).\n\nAll positions during the sequence are safe, as verified against the car states and their movements.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 2 and the player starts at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant note: The grid has vertical axis y=0 to y=9. The freeways (with cars) are from y=1 to y=8. The player is currently at y=1 (which is freeway 1). We need to avoid being on a freeway y at turn T if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nPlayer update: \n  - Action U: y increases by 1 (unless at y=9, then cannot go above 9, but we are going to 9 so we can stop at 9)\n  - Action D: y decreases by 1 (unless at y=0)\n  - Action S: stay\n\nCar update:\n  All cars in this problem are right-moving? Actually, looking at the data, the direction is given as \"right\". So for right-moving cars:\n    Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [since at t1 the car span is [tau, h] for right-moving]\n\nBut note: the initial state is given at turn t1=2.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at yT (which is one of the freeways 1..8) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in [tau + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2)] for a right-moving car.\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, they are only on the freeway y at turn T. They are not on freeway y' until the next turn? Actually, the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, then at turn T you are still on y_T and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}. So at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T, and at turn T+1, we check the car on freeway y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn 2 at y=1. We are on freeway 1 at turn 2.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. Note that y=9 is not a freeway (since freeways are 1..8), so once we are at y=9 we are safe.\n\nWe can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So the minimum H is at least 8 (since we start at 1 and need to get to 9: 8 moves up). But we have to avoid cars, so we might need to wait (use S) sometimes.\n\nTherefore, we are going to simulate from turn 2 onward, and we need to check for collisions on the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nLet me write down the car configurations at turn 2 (current turn) for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): \n  Car1: (60,49,right,6) -> at turn 2: [49,60]? Wait, the representation says: for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] meaning the tail is at tau and head at h? But in the example: (60,49,right,6) -> that would be head=60, tail=49? But then the span is [49,60]. However, note that the car moves right: so at time t, the car covers [tau, h] and then at time T>t1, it moves by s*(T-t1) to the right.\n\nBut wait: the update rule says for right-moving: \n  Initial span: [tau, h] at t1 -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\nSo for freeway 1 at turn 2 (t1=2):\n  Car1: (60,49,right,6) -> at turn T: [49 + 6*(T-2), 60 + 6*(T-2)]\n  Car2: (24,13,right,6) -> [13+6*(T-2), 24+6*(T-2)]\n  Car3: (-12,-23,right,6) -> [-23+6*(T-2), -12+6*(T-2)]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): \n  One car: (24,-11,right,36) -> [-11+36*(T-2), 24+36*(T-2)]\n\nFreeways 3 to 8 (y=3 to 8) all have the same two cars:\n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,6) -> [-47+6*(T-2), -36+6*(T-2)]\n  Car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*(T-2), 12+6*(T-2)]\n\nWe are at turn 2 at position (0,1). We are on freeway 1 at turn 2.\n\nWe must avoid being at (0, y) at turn T when y is between 1 and 8 and there is a car on freeway y such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that gets us to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nMinimum H: We are at y=1 and need to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 8 (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nLet me check freeway 1 at turn 2: \n  For car1: [49+0, 60+0] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n  For car2: [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n  For car3: [-23, -12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12]\nSo at turn 2, we are safe at y=1.\n\nNow, we have to plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to go up as much as possible, but we have to check at each step.\n\nIdea: we simulate the next turns and check for collisions. We can only use U, D, S. We are trying to minimize H, so we prefer U when possible.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn. We start at turn 2 at y=1.\n\nTurn 2: at y=1 -> safe (as above)\n\nWe have to choose an action at turn 2 that will lead to the next state. We want to go to y=9 as fast as possible, so we try to go up.\n\nAction at turn 2: U -> then at turn 3 we will be at y=2.\n\nBut we must check: at turn 3, we are at y=2 (freeway 2) and we must check freeway 2 at turn 3.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 3 (T=3, so T-2=1):\n  The car: [-11+36*(1), 24+36*(1)] = [25, 60] -> 0 is not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=2 at turn 3.\n\nNow at turn 3: we are at y=2. Then we choose U again to go to y=3 at turn 4.\n\nCheck freeway 3 at turn 4: (T=4, T-2=2)\n  For freeway 3 (and same for 4,5,6,7,8) at turn 4:\n    Car1: [-47+6*2, -36+6*2] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\n    Car2: [1+6*2, 12+12] = [1+12, 12+12] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=3 at turn 4.\n\nNow at turn 4: we are at y=3. Then we choose U to go to y=4 at turn 5.\n\nCheck freeway 4 at turn 5: (T=5, T-2=3)\n  Car1: [-47+6*3, -36+18] = [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\n  Car2: [1+18, 12+18] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\nSo we go to y=4 at turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: at y=4 -> then U to y=5 at turn 6.\n\nCheck freeway 5 at turn 6: (T=6, T-2=4)\n  Car1: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12] -> safe.\n  Car2: [1+24, 12+24] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nGo to y=5 at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: at y=5 -> U to y=6 at turn 7.\n\nCheck freeway 6 at turn 7: (T=7, T-2=5)\n  Car1: [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17, -6] -> note: -6 is negative, but 0 is not in this interval? Actually, 0 is greater than -6? The interval is [-17, -6] which is all negative -> safe.\n  Car2: [1+30, 12+30] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nGo to y=6 at turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: at y=6 -> U to y=7 at turn 8.\n\nCheck freeway 7 at turn 8: (T=8, T-2=6)\n  Car1: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0] -> wait, 0 is included? Because the car spans from -11 to 0? \n      So the car covers x from -11 to 0 at turn 8 on freeway 7. Therefore, if we are at (0,7) at turn 8, we are at x=0 which is in the span? -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=7 at turn 8.\n\nSo we must avoid that. What can we do?\n\nOption 1: Instead of moving up at turn 7, we could wait (S) at turn 7? Then at turn 7 we are still at y=6. Then at turn 8 we would be at y=6? But we want to go up.\n\nBut note: if we do S at turn 7, then at turn 7 we are at y=6 and then at turn 8 we can do U to go to y=7.\n\nBut at turn 8, we would be at y=7 -> and we just saw that at turn 8 on freeway 7, the car1 spans [-11,0] -> so 0 is included -> collision.\n\nSo going to y=7 at turn 8 is bad.\n\nAlternative: we could go up at turn 7 to y=7 at turn 8 -> which we saw is bad, or we could wait at turn 7 (stay at y=6) and then at turn 8 we are at y=6. Then at turn 9 we can go to y=7. But we need to check freeway 7 at turn 9.\n\nLet me compute freeway 7 at turn 9 (T=9, T-2=7):\n  Car1: [-47+6*7, -36+42] = [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5, 6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes, because -5 <= 0 <=6 -> collision.\n\nSo at turn 9, if we are at y=7, we also have a collision.\n\nWhat about turn 10? \n  Car1: [-47+6*8, -36+48] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo if we can be at y=7 at turn 10, then we are safe.\n\nBut how? We are at turn 7 at y=6. We have to wait until turn 10 to be at y=7? That would take 3 turns (turn7: stay, turn8: stay, turn9: stay? then turn10: go up?).\n\nBut note: we can also consider going down? But we are trying to minimize the total turns, and going down would increase the number of turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to skip freeway 7 by going from y=6 to y=7 and then quickly to y=8? But we have to wait until the car passes.\n\nBut at turn 8 and turn 9, freeway 7 has a car covering 0. So we must not be on freeway 7 at turns 8 and 9.\n\nWe can be on freeway 7 only from turn 10 onward? Then we can go to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nBut how do we get to turn 10 without being on freeway 7 too early? We are at turn 7 at y=6.\n\nAt turn 7 (current position: y=6) we have to choose an action.\n\nIf we go up at turn 7, we are at y=7 at turn 8 -> collision at turn 8.\nIf we stay at turn 7, then at turn 8 we are at y=6. Then at turn 8 we can choose to go up to y=7 at turn 9 -> but at turn 9 on freeway 7: collision (as above).\nIf we stay at turn 8 as well, then at turn 9 we are at y=6, and then at turn 10 we go up to y=7 -> safe (as at turn 10 the car1 is at [1,12] and doesn't cover 0).\n\nBut what about freeway 6 at turns 8 and 9? We are at y=6 during turns 7,8,9? We must check freeway 6 at those turns.\n\nWe were at freeway 6 at turn 7 and we are safe (as computed earlier for turn7: car1 [-17,-6] and car2 [31,42] -> safe).\n\nNow, at turn 8 (T=8) on freeway 6:\n  Car1: [-47+6*6, -36+36] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision if we are at y=6 at turn 8.\n\nOh! So if we stay at y=6 at turn 8, we get a collision because at turn8, freeway6 has a car covering 0.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at y=6 at turn 8.\n\nSo the above plan (staying at y=6 for turns 7,8,9) is not possible because at turn8 we are at y=6 and freeway6 has a collision.\n\nWe must leave y=6 by turn8? Because at turn8, freeway6 is dangerous.\n\nBut we cannot go to y=7 at turn8 (because freeway7 is dangerous) and we cannot go to y=5? because that would be going down.\n\nLet me check freeway5 at turn8? If we go down from y=6 to y=5 at turn8, then at turn8 we are at y=5.\n\nCheck freeway5 at turn8 (T=8, T-2=6):\n  Car1: [-47+6*6, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> collision? same as freeway6? Yes, because the car configuration for freeways 3-8 are identical? \n\nIndeed, the car list for freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are the same: two cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6). So at turn8, every freeway from 3 to 8 will have:\n  Car1: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n  Car2: [1+36,12+36] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, at turn8, if we are on any freeway from 3 to 8 at y=3,4,5,6,7,8, we will collide because of car1? Actually, for freeway5 at turn8: if we are at y=5, then we check freeway5 and there is a car covering 0 -> collision.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn8: all will have a car covering 0? \n\nBut wait: at turn8, freeway3: same cars -> car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on any freeway from 3 to 8 at turn8.\n\nBut we are currently at turn7 at y=6. We must leave freeway6 by turn8? And we cannot go to freeway5 or freeway7 because they are also in the danger set.\n\nWhat about freeway2? We were at freeway2 at turn3 and then we went up. Now we are at y=6 at turn7. We can go down to y=5? But that would be freeway5 at turn8 -> which is dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to y=5 at turn7? Then at turn7 we are at y=5? But we are at turn7: we are at y=6 at the start of turn7. We choose D: then at turn8 we are at y=5.\n\nBut at turn7, when we are at y=5? Actually, we are at y=6 at the start of turn7. We choose an action for turn7.\n\nIf we choose D at turn7: then at turn7 we are still at y=6? Then at turn8 we move to y=5. \n\nBut note: during turn7, we are at y=6 (we are on freeway6 at turn7). We already computed that at turn7, freeway6 is safe (car1: [-17,-6] and car2: [31,42] -> 0 not in either). So turn7 is safe.\n\nThen at turn8, we are at y=5. But at turn8, freeway5 is dangerous: car1 covers [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we go down further? For example, at turn7 we go down to y=5? Then at turn8 we are at y=5 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to y=4 at turn7? Then at turn7 we are at y=5? Actually, we start at y=6 at turn7. If we choose D, then at the next state (turn8) we are at y=5. But we cannot do two downs in one move.\n\nWe can only change by one per turn. So from y=6, we can go to y=5 at turn8 (by choosing D at turn7) or to y=7 (by U) or stay at y=6 (by S).\n\nBut we have seen that at turn8, we cannot be on freeways 3-8. So we must be on freeway1 or freeway2? \n\nBut we are at y=6 at turn7. We cannot jump to y=1 or y=2 in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turn8. The only safe freeways at turn8 are freeway1 and freeway2? Because freeways 1 and 2 have different car configurations.\n\nLet me check freeway1 and freeway2 at turn8.\n\nFreeway1 at turn8 (T=8, T-2=6):\n  Car1: [49+6*6, 60+36] = [49+36,60+36] = [85,96] -> safe.\n  Car2: [13+36,24+36] = [49,60] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n  So freeway1 is safe at turn8.\n\nFreeway2 at turn8 (T=8, T-2=6):\n  The car: [-11+36*6, 24+36*6] = [-11+216, 24+216] = [205,240] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 and freeway2 are safe at turn8.\n\nTherefore, we must be at either y=1 or y=2 at turn8 to avoid collision.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at turn7. We can only move by one per turn. So we cannot get to y=1 or y=2 in one move (from y=6 to y=5,4,3,2,1 is 5 moves? but we have only one move at turn7 to go to turn8).\n\nSo we cannot get to y=1 or y=2 at turn8 from y=6 at turn7.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turn8. But we are at y=6 at turn7. We have to leave the freeways 3-8 by turn7? But at turn7, we are already at freeway6 (which is one of 3-8) and we are safe at turn7? But the problem is the next turn.\n\nBut note: at turn7, we are at freeway6 and we are safe. Then at turn8, we must not be on freeways 3-8. But we can only move to adjacent y: y=5 or y=7 (both in 3-8) or stay at y=6 (also in 3-8). So we are stuck.\n\nWe need to be at y=1 or y=2 at turn8. How can we achieve that?\n\nWe have to start going down earlier.\n\nLet's backtrack.\n\nWe are at turn2: y=1 -> safe.\nTurn3: we went to y=2 -> safe.\nTurn4: to y=3 -> safe.\nTurn5: to y=4 -> safe.\nTurn6: to y=5 -> safe.\nTurn7: we are at y=6.\n\nBut we now see that at turn8, we cannot be on freeways 3-8. So we must have been at a lower freeway by turn8. \n\nWhat if we don't go up so quickly? Maybe we wait at some freeway to let time pass so that at turn8 we are at a safe freeway (1 or 2).\n\nBut we are at turn7 at y=6. We cannot go back to y=2 in one move.\n\nWe must plan to be at y=2 or y=1 by turn8. But we are at turn7 at y=6. That means we would have to have started going down earlier.\n\nSo let's try a different route: we might have to wait at some freeway before turn7.\n\nFor example, at turn2: we are at y=1. We could wait (S) at turn2, then at turn3 we are still at y=1.\n\nBut at turn3, freeway1: \n  Car1: [49+6*(3-2)=55, 60+6=66] -> safe.\n  Car2: [13+6=19,24+6=30] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-23+6=-17, -12+6=-6] -> safe.\nSo safe.\n\nThen at turn3: we can go up to y=2.\n\nBut then we are at turn4 at y=2? \n  Freeway2 at turn4: T-2=2 -> [-11+36*2=61, 24+72=96] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn4: go up to y=3 at turn5.\n\nBut then we are at turn5 at y=3: \n  Freeway3 at turn5: T-2=3 -> \n      Car1: [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\nThen turn5: go to y=4 at turn6 -> \n  Freeway4 at turn6: T-2=4 -> \n      Car1: [-47+24, -36+24]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn6: go to y=5 at turn7 -> \n  Freeway5 at turn7: T-2=5 -> \n      Car1: [-47+30, -36+30]=[-17,-6] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+30,12+30]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\nNow at turn7: we are at y=5. We want to avoid freeways 3-8 at turn8. So we must go down to y=4? But that is still freeway4 (which is in 3-8). Or to y=6? also in 3-8. Or stay at y=5? also in 3-8.\n\nBut we need to be at y=1 or y=2 at turn8.\n\nWe are at y=5 at turn7. We can only move to y=4,5, or6 at turn8. We cannot get to y=2.\n\nSo this doesn't work.\n\nWe need to be at a lower freeway earlier. For example, at turn6, instead of being at y=5, we could be at a lower y.\n\nBut we are at turn5 at y=4. At turn5, we could go down to y=3 at turn6? Then at turn6 we are at y=3.\n\nThen at turn7, we could go down to y=2 at turn8? Then at turn8 we are at y=2 -> which is safe (freeway2 at turn8 is safe, as computed: [205,240]).\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\nTurn2: start at y=1 -> safe.\nTurn2 action: U -> to y=2 at turn3. (or should we wait? but we want to minimize turns, so go up)\n\nBut if we go up at turn2, we are at y=2 at turn3.\n\nThen at turn3: we are at y=2. Instead of going up, we could go down? But that would be back to y=1. Or wait.\n\nBut we want to eventually go up, so we should go up. However, to avoid the turn8 problem, we need to be at y=2 at turn8. So we have to slow down.\n\nPlan: we go up to y=2 at turn3, then we wait at y=2 for several turns until turn8? Then at turn8 we are at y=2 (safe), and then after turn8 we can go up quickly.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: y=2 (safe).\n\nTurn3: S (stay) -> turn4: y=2 (check freeway2 at turn4: T=4, T-2=2 -> [-11+72, 24+72] = [61,96] -> safe).\n\nTurn4: S -> turn5: y=2 -> freeway2 at turn5: T=5, T-2=3 -> [-11+108,24+108]=[97,132] -> safe.\n\nTurn5: S -> turn6: y=2 -> freeway2 at turn6: T=6, T-2=4 -> [-11+144,24+144]=[133,168] -> safe.\n\nTurn6: S -> turn7: y=2 -> freeway2 at turn7: T=7, T-2=5 -> [-11+180,24+180]=[169,204] -> safe.\n\nTurn7: S -> turn8: y=2 -> freeway2 at turn8: T=8, T-2=6 -> [205,240] -> safe.\n\nNow at turn8: we are at y=2. We need to get to y=9. We can start going up.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeways 3-8 at turn8? We are at y=2 at turn8, which is safe. Then we can go up.\n\nBut note: after turn8, the danger at turn8 is over. But freeways 3-8 might be dangerous at later turns? But we have to check as we go.\n\nFrom turn8: we are at y=2. We want to go to y=9. That will take 7 moves (if we go up every turn).\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nLet's simulate from turn8 onward:\n\nTurn8: at y=2 -> choose U to go to y=3 at turn9.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn9 (T=9, T-2=7):\n  Car1: [-47+6*7, -36+42] = [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nOh no! So at turn9, freeway3 is dangerous.\n\nWe cannot be at y=3 at turn9.\n\nWe can try to wait at y=2 at turn8? But then at turn9 we are at y=2, then we can go to y=3 at turn10.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn10 (T=10, T-2=8):\n  Car1: [-47+6*8, -36+48] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  Car2: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo if we go to y=3 at turn10, it is safe.\n\nSo plan from turn8 onward:\n\nTurn8: S (stay at y=2) -> safe (as above).\nTurn9: U -> to y=3 at turn10? \n  But at turn9: we are at y=2 (because we did S at turn8, so at turn9 we are still at y=2). Then we do U at turn9: then at turn10 we are at y=3.\n\nBut at turn9: we are at y=2, so we check freeway2 at turn9 (T=9, T-2=7): \n  [-11+36*7, 24+36*7] = [-11+252, 24+252] = [241,276] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: as above, safe.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\nTurn10: at y=3 -> U to y=4 at turn11.\n  Freeway4 at turn11 (T=11, T-2=9):\n      Car1: [-47+54, -36+54] = [7,18] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+54,12+54]=[55,66] -> safe.\n\nTurn11: U to y=5 at turn12.\n  Freeway5 at turn12 (T=12, T-2=10):\n      Car1: [-47+60, -36+60]=[13,24] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nTurn12: U to y=6 at turn13.\n  Freeway6 at turn13 (T=13, T-2=11):\n      Car1: [-47+66, -36+66]=[19,30] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+66,12+66]=[67,78] -> safe.\n\nTurn13: U to y=7 at turn14.\n  Freeway7 at turn14 (T=14, T-2=12):\n      Car1: [-47+72, -36+72]=[25,36] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+72,12+72]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nTurn14: U to y=8 at turn15.\n  Freeway8 at turn15 (T=15, T-2=13):\n      Car1: [-47+78, -36+78]=[31,42] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+78,12+78]=[79,90] -> safe.\n\nTurn15: U to y=9 at turn16.\n  And y=9 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nBut note: when we are at y=8 at turn15, we are on freeway8. Then we move to y=9 at turn16: at turn16 we are at y=9 (safe).\n\nSo the entire plan:\n\nTurn2: U (to y=2 at turn3)\nThen we wait at y=2 from turn3 to turn7 (5 turns: turn3,4,5,6,7 we do S) -> so we are at y=2 at turn8.\nThen turn8: S (wait again) -> y=2 at turn9.\nThen turn9: U -> to y=3 at turn10.\nThen turn10: U -> to y=4 at turn11.\nThen turn11: U -> to y=5 at turn12.\nThen turn12: U -> to y=6 at turn13.\nThen turn13: U -> to y=7 at turn14.\nThen turn14: U -> to y=8 at turn15.\nThen turn15: U -> to y=9 at turn16.\n\nTotal turns from turn2 to turn16: 15 turns? But note, we start at turn2, and we do actions at turn2, turn3, ... turn15 (that's 14 actions) to get to y=9 at turn16.\n\nBut let me count:\n\nAt turn2: action U -> at turn3: y=2.\nAt turn3: S -> at turn4: y=2.\nAt turn4: S -> at turn5: y=2.\nAt turn5: S -> at turn6: y=2.\nAt turn6: S -> at turn7: y=2.\nAt turn7: S -> at turn8: y=2.\nAt turn8: S -> at turn9: y=2.\nAt turn9: U -> at turn10: y=3.\nAt turn10: U -> at turn11: y=4.\nAt turn11: U -> at turn12: y=5.\nAt turn12: U -> at turn13: y=6.\nAt turn13: U -> at turn14: y=7.\nAt turn14: U -> at turn15: y=8.\nAt turn15: U -> at turn16: y=9.\n\nWe reached y=9 at turn16. The actions are from turn2 to turn15: 14 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? It takes 14 turns. However, we might be able to do better.\n\nNotice that we are forced to avoid freeways 3-8 at turn8, and also freeway3 at turn9 is dangerous. But after turn9, freeway3 becomes safe at turn10.\n\nBut we spent a lot of time waiting at y=2.\n\nAlternative idea: after turn8, the danger is over for freeway2? And we are at y=2 at turn8. But can we leave y=2 earlier? We have to wait until turn8 to avoid the freeway3-8 danger at turn8, but then we have to wait until turn10 to go to freeway3.\n\nBut note: at turn8, we are at y=2. We want to go up. But freeway3 is dangerous at turn9. So we have to wait at y=2 until turn9 to then go to y=3 at turn10.\n\nSo we must do two waits at y=2: turn8 and turn9.\n\nBut what if we are at a higher freeway after turn8? For example, can we be at y=1 at turn8? But y=1 is safe at turn8 (freeway1 is safe). Then from y=1 we can go up.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at turn8, we would have to go down from y=2 at some point.\n\nFor example, after being at y=2 at turn3, we could go down to y=1 at turn4? Then wait at y=1 until turn8.\n\nBut then at turn8 we are at y=1. Then we can go up to y=2 at turn9 (freeway2 at turn9 is safe, as above: [241,276]). Then to y=3 at turn10 (safe).\n\nThis is the same number of moves: \n  turn2: U -> y=2 at turn3.\n  turn3: D -> y=1 at turn4.\n  turn4: S -> y=1 at turn5.\n  turn5: S -> y=1 at turn6.\n  turn6: S -> y=1 at turn7.\n  turn7: S -> y=1 at turn8.\n  turn8: U -> y=2 at turn9.\n  turn9: U -> y=3 at turn10.\n  ... then the same as before to y=9 at turn16.\n\nSo still 14 moves.\n\nBut can we save a move? \n\nNotice that we are at y=2 at turn3. We need to be at a safe freeway at turn8. Safe freeways are 1 and 2. We are already at y=2 at turn3. If we wait at y=2 until turn8, that's 5 waits (turns 3,4,5,6,7) and then one more wait at turn8? But we don't have to wait at turn8 if we can leave earlier? \n\nBut we cannot leave y=2 until turn9 because freeway3 is dangerous at turn9. So we must be at y=2 at turn9? Then we go to y=3 at turn10.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn8. Then at turn8 we could go up to y=3 at turn9? But that is dangerous. So we have to wait at turn8 to be at y=2 at turn9, and then go up at turn9 to be at y=3 at turn10.\n\nSo we have to be at y=2 at both turn8 and turn9? \n\nActually, at turn8: we can be at y=2, then at turn9 we are at y=2 (by doing S at turn8) and then at turn9 we do U to be at y=3 at turn10.\n\nBut we could consider being at y=1 at turn9? Then we could go to y=2 at turn10? But that would be slower.\n\nSo the minimal might be 14.\n\nBut let me see if we can be more efficient.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=3 before turn8? But then at turn8 we are at y=3, which is dangerous.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=3 at turn4, but then come back down to y=2 by turn8?\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: y=2.\nTurn3: U -> turn4: y=3 (safe at turn4: freeway3 at turn4: T=4, T-2=2 -> car1: [-35,-24], car2: [13,24] -> safe).\nTurn4: D -> turn5: y=2 (freeway2 at turn5: [97,132] -> safe).\nTurn5: S -> turn6: y=2.\nTurn6: S -> turn7: y=2.\nTurn7: S -> turn8: y=2 (safe).\n\nThen we are at y=2 at turn8. Then we have to wait at turn8 (S) to be at y=2 at turn9, then at turn9: U to y=3 at turn10.\n\nThen continue as before.\n\nThis plan: \n  turn2: U\n  turn3: U\n  turn4: D   (back to y=2 at turn5)\n  turn5: S\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  ... up to turn16: y=9.\n\nThat's 15 actions? Because we added an extra D and we still have 14 actions from turn2 to turn15? Let's count:\n\n  turn2: U (to y=2 at turn3)\n  turn3: U (to y=3 at turn4)\n  turn4: D (to y=2 at turn5)\n  turn5: S (y=2 at turn6)\n  turn6: S (y=2 at turn7)\n  turn7: S (y=2 at turn8)\n  turn8: S (y=2 at turn9)\n  turn9: U (y=3 at turn10)\n  turn10: U (y=4 at turn11)\n  ... up to turn15: U to y=8 at turn16? \n  Then we need turn16: U to y=9 at turn17.\n\nThat would be 16 turns? We started at turn2 and the last action is at turn16 (to reach y=9 at turn17). And we have 15 actions (from turn2 to turn16). But we want to minimize the number of turns (H) which is the number of actions? Or the time until we reach? The problem says: minimal number of turns H, and a sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWe are at turn2, and we do H actions: at turn2, turn3, ..., turn2+H-1. Then at turn2+H, we are at the next state? And we want that at turn2+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our first plan, we did actions from turn2 to turn15 (14 actions) and at turn16 we are at y=9. So the last action is at turn15, and at the next state (turn16) we are at y=9. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then after the last action we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the game dynamics: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose action a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t1 (turn2), we start at y=1. Then we do an action a_2, which determines y_3. Then a_3 determines y_4, and so on.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut note: t1+H-1 is the turn after the last action? \n\nThe sequence of actions is for t = t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H. But the problem says we want to reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me see: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nSo we want at turn (t1 + H - 1) to be at y=9.\n\nIn the dynamics, y_{t} is the position at the start of turn t? Or after the action of turn t-1?\n\nTypically: \n  At the start of turn t, we are at position (0, y_t).\n  Then we choose action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo after the action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, we are at y_{t} at the start of turn t.\n\nWe want at the start of turn (t1 + H - 1) to be at (0,9).\n\nBut we start at turn t1 (turn2) at y_{t1}=1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we will be at turn t1 + (H-1) = t1 + H - 1, and we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. The last action is at turn t1+H-2, which leads to y_{t1+H-1} at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we need H-1 actions to go from turn2 to turn2+H-1.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing (H-1=0), then at turn2 we are at y=1, not 9. So H must be at least 8: because we need to go from 1 to 9: 8 moves.\n\nIn our first attempt without waiting, we would do 8 actions (all U) and be at y=9 at turn10. But we saw that at turn8 we would be at y=7 and collide.\n\nIn the first safe plan I came up with, we are at y=9 at turn16, so that is turn2+H-1 = 16 -> H-1 = 14, so H=15? Let me clarify:\n\nWe start at turn2: we are at y2=1.\nWe want y_{2 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9 is T = 2 + H - 1.\n\nIn our first safe plan, we are at y=9 at turn16, so:\n  2 + H - 1 = 16  => H - 1 = 14 => H=15.\n\nSo the number of actions is H = 15? But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1 = 2 to 2+14=16? But that is 15 actions? \n\nBut in our simulation, we did actions from turn2 to turn15 (14 actions) and then at turn16 we are at y=9. That means we did 14 actions. So H-1=14, thus H=15.\n\nBut the sequence of actions should be for turns: 2,3,4,...,16? But that would be 15 turns. However, we only did 14 actions? \n\nLet me recount with the turn indexing:\n\nTurn2: start at y2=1.\nAfter action a2, we are at y3.\nAfter action a3, we are at y4.\n...\nAfter action a15, we are at y16.\n\nWe want y16=9.\n\nSo the actions are a2, a3, a4, ..., a15: that's 14 actions.\n\nTherefore, H-1 = 14, so H=15.\n\nAnd we are at turn16 (which is 2+15-1=16) at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence has 14 actions.\n\nNow, is there a faster way? We are forced to avoid freeways 3-8 at turn8 and also freeway3 at turn9. The earliest we can be at y=3 is turn10.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 moves (if there are no cars). But because of the cars, we have to wait.\n\nThe waiting at the beginning: we are at y=2 from turn3 to turn9 (7 turns at y=2) and then we go up in 7 moves (from y=2 to y=9) -> total 14 moves? But we are at y=2 from turn3 to turn9: that's 7 turns (turn3 to turn9) but we only need to be at y=2 until turn9, and then we start going up.\n\nBut the moves: \n  from turn2 to turn3: U (1 move) to get to y=2.\n  then from turn3 to turn9: 6 waits (S at turn3,4,5,6,7,8) -> 6 waits.\n  then from turn9 to turn16: 7 moves up (U at turn9,10,...,15) -> 7 moves.\nTotal moves: 1 + 6 + 7 = 14.\n\nAnd then at turn16 we are at y=9.\n\nCan we reduce the 6 waits? We have to be at a safe freeway at turn8 and also avoid freeway3 at turn9. The only safe freeways at turn8 are y=1 and y=2. We are at y=2 at turn3. We can stay there until turn9. But we must be at y=2 at turn9 to then go to y=3 at turn10.\n\nWe cannot leave y=2 before turn9 because if we leave to y=3 at turn9, we collide. So we have to be at y=2 at turn9.\n\nAnd at turn8 we must be at y=1 or y=2. So we are at y=2 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nThe only way to reduce waits is to be at y=1 at turn8 and then go to y=2 at turn9. But then we are at y=2 at turn9, which is safe, and then we go to y=3 at turn10.\n\nHow many moves would that take?\n\n  turn2: U to y=2 at turn3.\n  turn3: D to y=1 at turn4.\n  turn4: S to y=1 at turn5.\n  turn5: S to y=1 at turn6.\n  turn6: S to y=1 at turn7.\n  turn7: S to y=1 at turn8.\n  turn8: U to y=2 at turn9.\n  turn9: U to y=3 at turn10.\n  then 6 more U to get to y=9 at turn16.\n\nTotal moves: 1 (U) + 1 (D) + 4 (S at turns4-7) + 1 (U at turn8) + 1 (U at turn9) + 6 (U from turn10 to turn15) = 1+1+4+1+1+6 = 14 moves.\n\nSame number.\n\nSo we cannot reduce below 14 moves.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at y=3 earlier than turn10? We saw that freeway3 is dangerous at turn9. What about turn10 is the first safe turn.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 4-8, they are safe after turn8? For example, freeway4 at turn9: \n  T=9, T-2=7: \n      Car1: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> covers 0? yes -> dangerous.\n\nAt turn10: safe.\n\nSo we cannot be on any freeway from 3 to 8 at turn9 either? \n\nFreeway3 at turn9: dangerous.\nFreeway4 at turn9: dangerous (same car1: [-5,6]).\nSimilarly, freeways5,6,7,8: at turn9: \n  Car1: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> covers 0.\n\nSo indeed, at turn9, every freeway from 3 to 8 has car1 covering 0. So we must avoid freeways 3-8 at both turn8 and turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=1 or y=2 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nSo we have to be at y=1 or y=2 for both turns.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=3 is turn10.\n\nThen we need 7 moves to go from y=3 to y=9: that takes from turn10 to turn16.\n\nWe start at turn2 at y=1. We need to get to y=1 or y=2 by turn8 and stay there until turn9, and then go to y=3 at turn10.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to get from y=1 to y=2 is one move (U). But we start at y=1 at turn2. We can choose to stay at y=1 or go to y=2.\n\nTo be at y=2 at turn8 and turn9, we can do:\n\nOption A: \n  Stay at y=1 until turn7, then go to y=2 at turn8, then stay at y=2 at turn9.\n  How many moves?\n      From turn2 to turn7: 6 turns at y=1? \n          Actions: turn2: S, turn3: S, turn4: S, turn5: S, turn6: S, turn7: U (to y=2 at turn8)\n      Then turn8: S (to stay at y=2 at turn9)\n      Then turn9: U to y=3 at turn10.\n      Then from turn10 to turn16: 6 U's? Because from y=3 to y=9 is 6 moves? \n          Actually, y=3 to y=4: turn10->11\n          y=4 to y=5: turn11->12\n          y=5 to y=6: turn12->13\n          y=6 to y=7: turn13->14\n          y=7 to y=8: turn14->15\n          y=8 to y=9: turn15->16\n      So that's 6 moves from turn10 to turn15.\n  Total moves: \n      turns2-7: 5 waits (S) and one U (at turn7) -> 6 actions? \n          turn2: S (y3=1)\n          turn3: S (y4=1)\n          turn4: S (y5=1)\n          turn5: S (y6=1)\n          turn6: S (y7=1)\n          turn7: U (y8=2)\n      turn8: S (y9=2)\n      turn9: U (y10=3)\n      turn10: U (y11=4)\n      turn11: U (y12=5)\n      turn12: U (y13=6)\n      turn13: U (y14=7)\n      turn14: U (y15=8)\n      turn15: U (y16=9)\n  So actions from turn2 to turn15: 14 actions.\n\nOption B: go to y=2 at turn3 and then wait until turn9.\n  turn2: U (y3=2)\n  turn3: S (y4=2)\n  turn4: S (y5=2)\n  turn5: S (y6=2)\n  turn6: S (y7=2)\n  turn7: S (y8=2)\n  turn8: S (y9=2)\n  turn9: U (y10=3)\n  ... then 6 U's to y=9 at turn16.\n\nAlso 14 actions.\n\nSo it seems 14 is the minimal.\n\nNow, we need to output the sequence.\n\nI'll choose the first option: we go up to y=2 immediately and then wait.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: S\nTurn4: S\nTurn5: S\nTurn6: S\nTurn7: S\nTurn8: S   (we are at y=2 at turn9)\nTurn9: U   (to y=3 at turn10)\nTurn10: U  (to y=4 at turn11)\nTurn11: U  (to y=5 at turn12)\nTurn12: U  (to y=6 at turn13)\nTurn13: U  (to y=7 at turn14)\nTurn14: U  (to y=8 at turn15)\nTurn15: U  (to y=9 at turn16)\n\nBut note: at turn9, we are at y=2 and we do U, so at turn10 we are at y=3.\n\nWe must check that at turn10, freeway3 is safe: as above, car1: [1,12] (does not cover 0) and car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, the rest are safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nThis has 14 actions (turns 2 to 15) and at turn16 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=15 (since H-1=14). So we list 14 actions.\n\nWe start at t1=2, and t goes from 0 to 13 (since H-1=14, so t=0,1,...,13) -> 14 actions.\n\nThis matches.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check if we can start going up earlier. For example, can we go to y=3 at turn10, then y=4 at turn11, etc., and we are at y=9 at turn16. But we need 7 moves from y=2 to y=9? Actually, from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves (2->3,3->4,...,8->9: 7 moves). So from turn9 to turn16: 7 moves. And we are at y=2 at turn9. So we must start the upward journey at turn9.\n\nBut we are forced to wait at y=2 until turn9.\n\nTherefore, the plan is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 15, requiring 14 actions. The sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 2\\) until turn 9, then moving upward. The car configurations indicate that freeways 3 to 8 are dangerous at turns 8 and 9 due to car spans covering \\(x = 0\\), but freeways 1 and 2 are safe. Moving to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 3 and staying there until turn 9 ensures safety. From turn 9 onward, moving upward avoids collisions as the car spans no longer cover \\(x = 0\\) at the required turns.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 2: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 1 cars at turn 2 do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Turns 3 to 8: Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 cars at these turns do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Turn 9: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 cars at turn 10 do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Turns 10 to 15: Move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 16 (safe, as freeways 4 to 8 cars at turns 11 to 16 do not cover \\(x = 0\\), and \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2 + 15 - 1 = 16\\)) with \\(H = 15\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: S \\\\\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,2) at turn t1 = 3. I need to get to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (+1 in y), D for down (-1 in y), or S for stay (0 change). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t1=3, with head and tail, direction, and speed. Since all cars are moving right (direction right), I can ignore left-moving for now.\n\nThe collision rule: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time because cars move.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new freeway, at turn T, if they move, they are not considered on the new freeway until turn T+1. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and only check cars on y_T. If they move to y_{T+1} at turn T, they start being on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1=3 as (0,2), so at turn 3, they are on freeway 2.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 3 onwards to reach y=9.\n\nList the car states at turn t1=3:\n\nFor freeway 1: three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6). Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so for (-48,-59), since it's right-moving, head should be larger than tail? No, let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. So for right-moving, h is the head, which is the right end, so h > τ. But in the data, for first car on freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 6). -48 and -59, -48 > -59? -48 is greater than -59, so h=-48, τ=-59? But in the span, it says [τ, h] for right-moving, so [ -59, -48 ]? That doesn't make sense because -59 is left of -48 if we think of number line.\n\nAssume the x-axis increases to the right. So for a right-moving car, head is at higher x, tail at lower x. So for [τ, h], τ is left (tail), h is right (head). So for (-48,-59), if τ=-59 and h=-48, but -59 < -48, so τ=-59, h=-48, so span from x=-59 to x=-48.\n\nSimilarly, (30,19,right,6): τ=19, h=30? 19 to 30, but 19<30, so τ=19, h=30.\n\nThe pair is given as (head, tail), I think? Let's read the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 6) — so h=-48, τ=-59? But for right-moving, head should be greater, which -48 > -59, yes. τ=-59, h=-48, so span from min to max: from τ to h, since τ < h for right-moving? No.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], meaning from τ to h, with τ < h? In this case, for (-48,-59), if h=-48, τ=-59, then τ=-59 < h=-48, so [τ,h] = [-59,-48], which is correct, from left to right.\n\nBut (30,19,right,6): h=30, τ=19, τ=19 < h=30, so [19,30].\n\nAnd (-6,-17,right,6): h=-6, τ=-17, τ=-17 < h=-6, so [-17,-6].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (60,25,right,36) — h=60, τ=25, τ=25<60, so [25,60].\n\nNow, all other freeways 3 to 8 have the same cars: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6).\n\nFor freeway 3: (-30,-41,right,6) — h=-30, τ=-41, τ=-41 < h=-30, so [-41,-30]\n\nAnd (18,7,right,6) — h=18, τ=7, τ=7<18, so [7,18]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThe player starts at y=2 at turn 3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is up.\n\nSince y=0 to 9, and freeways are 1 to 8 for cars, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer at (0,2), so at x=0, y=2.\n\nAt each turn, the player chooses action, changes y, and then for the new y, at that turn, if there is a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span, collision.\n\nCollision at turn T only if player is on freeway y_T and 0 in span of some car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSince player moves at turn T, y_{T} is the position after action? Let's see.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} is the position at the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, it says at turn T, if player is on freeway y_T.\n\nWhat is y_T? At turn T, the player position is y_T.\n\nFrom the dynamics: at turn t, player is at position (0, y_t). Then they choose action a_t, which sets Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut when is the position updated? It says y_{t+1} is the new position.\n\nFor collision: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway y_T, there is a car whose span contains x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a new freeway at turn T, you are not on the new freeway until turn T+1.\n\nFor example, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. You choose to move, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, but at turn T, you are still on y_T, and only check cars on y_T for collision at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo when you move, during the turn you are on the old freeway, and after action, you are on new for next turn.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at turn t1=3, so I need to compute their positions at future turns.\n\nLet T be the turn number, with t1=3.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span is based on initial span at t1=3 and time elapsed.\n\nFor right-moving car: span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nSince at t1, span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so both ends increase by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nt1=3, so for turn T, elapsed time is T - 3.\n\nSo span at T: [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)] for right-moving cars.\n\nCollision at turn T if player on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)]\n\nSince the span is a closed interval, I assume.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 3, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H turns, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for actions, starting from turn t1.\n\nSet the time: let t be the step from t1.\n\nSo at relative time t=0, which is absolute turn t1=3, player is at y=2.\n\nThen we apply actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t}, position y_{t1 + t +1}, I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt absolute turn T, player position y_T.\n\nFor T = t1 =3, y_3 =2.\n\nThen action a_3 is chosen, which sets Δy_3, so y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3.\n\nSimilarly, action a_4 sets Δy_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{3 + H} =9 for some H? Let's see the task.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nt1 + H -1.\n\nt1=3, so turn 3 + H -1 = turn 2 + H.\n\nAfter actions, the position is after H actions.\n\nStart at turn 3, position y_3.\n\nAfter first action a_3, at turn 4, position y_4.\n\nAfter second action a_4, at turn 5, y_5, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 3+k, position y_{3+k}.\n\nWe want y_{3+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nt1 + H -1.\n\nAnd the sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nSet H as the number of actions.\n\nAfter H actions, the turn is t1 + H, and position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nConfusion.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso, in the answer format, actions from Turn t1: a_{t1} to Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1, player is at position y_{t1}.\n\nThen, during turn t1, player chooses action a_{t1}, which determines the move, and after that, at the start of turn t1+1, position is y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+1, choose a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nThe collision check is at each turn T: at turn T, player is at position y_T, and we check if on freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in span at that turn.\n\nThe position y_T is the position at the start of turn T, before action, I think? But collision happens during the turn or what?\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, regardless of the action you take. The action affects the next turn.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the car positions at turn T.\n\nThen, after action, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn, y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSince t1=3, we want y_{3 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which affect y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At turn 3: position y_3=2\n\n- Choose a_3, then y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\n- At turn 4: position y_4, check collision if any car on freeway y_4 has 0 in span at turn 4\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T, 0 in span at T.\n\nAt turn 3: player is at y_3=2, so we need to check for collision at turn 3 on freeway 2.\n\nIs that right?\n\nAt turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check for freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nFor turn t1=3, y_3=2, so we must ensure that at turn 3, on freeway 2, no collision, i.e., 0 not in any car span on freeway 2 at turn 3.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nThen after action, the position changes for the next turn.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1.\n\nLet K = t1 + H -1, so y_K =9.\n\nThen H is the number of actions from t1 to K-1? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 for absolute turn from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nSo actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThese actions determine y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1, which is before action a_{t1 + H -1}? No.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is defined, then action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1} is set, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen, at that turn, we might take an action, but since we reached, we don't care about later actions, but we need to specify actions up to a_{t1 + H -1}, which is the action at turn t1 + H -1, which would affect y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care since we already reached at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, we include the action at the turn when we reach, but that action might be S or something.\n\nTo reach at turn T, y_T=9, and we take action at turn T, but since we are already at 9, we can take S or whatever, but it might cause collision if not careful, but at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly y=0.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nPlayer at turn 3, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 7 steps up, but I can move down or stay, so it might not be direct if there are obstacles.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from 2 to 9, the minimal number of moves is at least 7, all up, but I might need to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach, including the start turn or not?\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t1=3, y_3=2.\n\nIf I do nothing, I stay, but I need to reach 9.\n\nAfter H actions, the turn when position is 9 is t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I can reach in 0 actions, but I'm at 2, not 9, so H>0.\n\nMinimal H such that after H-1 actions or something.\n\nSet t = 0 at turn 3.\n\nAt time t=0 (turn 3), position y=2.\n\nThen after action a_0, at time t=1 (turn 4), position y= y_2 + Δy, etc.\n\nDefine relative time.\n\nLet τ be the step from t1.\n\nAt τ=0, turn=3, y=2\n\nAction a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + τ}, at turn t1 + τ +1, position y_{t1 + τ +1}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor this to be 9, and it is set by the actions before.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t1 + H -1} is determined by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, because a_{t1 + H -2} affects y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor turn T = t1 + H -1, y_T is determined by a_{T-1} if T> t1, but for T=t1, it's given.\n\nSince t1=3, for turn K = t1 + H -1, y_K =9.\n\nK = 3 + H -1 = 2 + H.\n\ny_K is determined by the actions from a_{t1} to a_{K-1}, since a_{t1} affects y_{t1+1}, ..., a_{K-1} affects y_K.\n\nAnd the actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, but t1 + H -1 = K, so a_K is the action at turn K, which affects y_{K+1}, not y_K.\n\nBut we want y_K=9, so we need actions up to a_{K-1}, which is a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to provide a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which includes a_K.\n\nSince at turn K, y_K=9, and no cars, we can set a_K to S, for example, to stay, but it doesn't affect the position.\n\nSo for the purpose of reaching, we can have a_K = S.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can have y_{3 + H -1} =9 with the actions.\n\nSince from y=2 to y=9, the difference is 7, so H-1 >=7? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 3, y=2.\n\nAfter first action (at turn 3), y_4 = 2 + Δy_3\n\nAfter second action (turn 4), y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, at turn 3+m, y_{3+m}\n\nWe want y_{3 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet M = H-1, so after M actions, at turn 3+M, y_{3+M} =9.\n\nThen M is the number of actions to reach from turn 4 to turn 3+M.\n\nBut we start from turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, position y_3=2.\n\nAfter 0 actions, position is still at turn 3, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 4, y_4.\n\nAfter 2 actions, at turn 5, y_5, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 3+k, y_{3+k} =9.\n\nBut we want at turn t1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1 = 2 + H, y_{2+H} =9.\n\nSo 2 + H = 3 + k for some k, so H = k +1.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn 3+k, set equal to 2+H, so 3+k = 2+H, thus H = k+1.\n\nSo for example, if I can reach in k actions to turn 3+k with y=9, then H = k+1.\n\nThe minimal number of turns from start to reach point.\n\nSince I need to move from 2 to 9, the minimal number of steps is 7, all up, so k=7, then H=8, reaching at turn 3+7=10, which is t1 + H -1 = 3 +8 -1=10, yes.\n\nOr if I stay or move down, it takes more turns.\n\nBut I might have to wait due to cars.\n\nNow, at turn 3, I am at y=2, so I need to check collision at turn 3 for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly for each turn when I am on a freeway with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions for each freeway at each turn.\n\nt1=3.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)] for right-moving, since all are right.\n\nThen collision on freeway k at turn T if 0 is in [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)] for some car on k.\n\nSince the span is continuous, I can find when 0 is covered.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 3, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 3: cars are (60,25,right,36) so τ=25, h=60, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 36*(T-3), 60 + 36*(T-3)]\n\nAt turn T=3, span [25 +0, 60+0] = [25,60], 0 not in, so no collision at turn 3 on freeway 2.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are 1 to 8, but freeway 1 has cars, 2 has cars, etc.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to see for each k and T, if there is a car on k that covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars.\n\nCar1: (-48,-59,right,6) so τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 6*(T-3), -48 + 6*(T-3) ]\n\nCar2: (30,19,right,6) τ=19, h=30, s=6, span [19 +6*(T-3), 30 +6*(T-3)]\n\nCar3: (-6,-17,right,6) τ=-17, h=-6, s=6, span [-17 +6*(T-3), -6 +6*(T-3)]\n\n0 in span for car1 if -59 +6(T-3) <= 0 <= -48 +6(T-3)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet u = T-3, time elapsed.\n\nFor car1: 0 in [-59 +6u, -48 +6u] iff -59 +6u <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +6u, so 6u <= 59 and 6u >= 48, so u <= 59/6 = 9.833, u >= 48/6=8.\n\nSo u from 8 to 9.833, so for u=8,9,10? u integer, T integer.\n\nu = T-3, integer.\n\nAt u=8: lower bound -59+48= -11? -59+6*8 = -59+48= -11, upper -48+48=0? -48+48=0, so span [-11,0], 0 included since closed interval.\n\nAt u=8, T=11, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], yes 0 in.\n\nAt u=9, T=12, span [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt u=10, T=13, span [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo car1 covers x=0 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow car2: [19+6u, 30+6u], 0 in if 19+6u <=0 and 0<=30+6u, but 19+6u <=0 implies u <= -19/6 negative, impossible since u>=0. 30+6u>0 always, so never 0 in [19+6u,30+6u] for u>=0.\n\nSimilarly, car3: [-17+6u, -6+6u]\n\n0 in if -17+6u <=0 and 0<= -6+6u, so 6u <=17, u<=17/6=2.833, and 6u>=6, u>=1.\n\nSo u=1,2\n\nu=1: T=4, span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nu=2: T=5, span [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nu=3: T=6, span [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n\n- At T=4: car3 covers, collision possible\n\n- T=5: car3 covers\n\n- T=11: car1 covers\n\n- T=12: car1 covers\n\nOther times no car covers x=0, so safe if on freeway 1 except at these turns.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car (60,25,right,36) τ=25, h=60, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [25 +36u, 60+36u] where u=T-3\n\n0 in if 25+36u <=0 and 0<=60+36u, but 25+36u<=0 impossible for u>=0, so never 0 in span. Freeway 2 is always safe? At turn 3, [25,60], 0 not in. At any u, min is 25+36u >=25>0, so x=0 never covered. So freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nBut player is on it at turn 3, no issue.\n\nNow freeway 3 to 8 all have the same cars: two cars each.\n\nCar A: (-30,-41,right,6) τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-41 +6u, -30 +6u]\n\n0 in if -41+6u <=0 and 0<= -30+6u, so 6u<=41, u<=41/6=6.833, and 6u>=30, u>=5.\n\nu integer, u=5,6\n\nu=5: T=8, span [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nu=6: T=9, span [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nu=7: T=10, span [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar B: (18,7,right,6) τ=7, h=18, s=6\n\nSpan [7+6u, 18+6u]\n\n0 in if 7+6u<=0 and 0<=18+6u, impossible since 7+6u>=7>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway 3 to 8, only car A can cover x=0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At T=8: collision if on freeway k for k=3 to 8\n\n- At T=9: collision if on freeway k for k=3 to 8\n\nOther times, for freeways 3-8, no collision except at T=8,9.\n\nFor freeway 1, collision at T=4,5,11,12\n\nFreeway 2 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe always.\n\nPlayer at turn 3, y=2 (freeway 2), safe since freeway 2 always safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn K=3+H-1.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can be there any time.\n\nThe minimal H: I need to go from y=2 to y=9, which requires net +7 in y.\n\nEach action can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo minimal actions to increase y by 7 is 7 ups, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nSince freeway 2 is always safe, I could stay there, but I need to go up.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns are:\n\nFor freeway 1: unsafe at T=4,5,11,12\n\nFor freeways 3-8: unsafe at T=8,9\n\nI am at turn 3, y=2.\n\nI need to plan a path.\n\nSince I want minimal turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nFor example, if I go directly up:\n\nAt turn 3, y=2, safe (freeway 2 safe)\n\nAction a3: suppose U, then y4=3\n\nAt turn 4, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nNow freeway 3 is unsafe at T=4? T=4, u=1, for freeway 3, at T=4, is it unsafe?\n\nFreeways 3-8 unsafe only at T=8,9, not at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, only freeway 1 is unsafe, but y=3 is freeway 3, which is safe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 unsafe at T=4,5, but we are not on it.\n\nAt turn 4, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: at T=4, u=1, span carA: [-41+6, -30+6]=[-35,-24], not contain 0\n\ncarB: [7+6,18+6]=[13,24], not contain 0, so safe.\n\nThen action a4: U, y5=4\n\nTurn 5, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=5, u=2, freeway 4: carA [-41+12, -30+12]=[-29,-18], no\n\ncarB [7+12,18+12]=[19,30], no, safe.\n\na5: U, y6=5\n\nTurn 6, y=5, freeway 5, safe similarly.\n\na6: U, y7=6\n\nTurn 7, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\na7: U, y8=7\n\nNow turn 8, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nBut at T=8, freeways 3-8 are unsafe! Because carA covers x=0 at T=8 for each of 3-8.\n\nAt T=8, if on freeway 7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue:\n\ny8=7, on freeway 7 at turn 8, unsafe.\n\nAction a7 was at turn 7, which set y8.\n\nAt turn 8, position y8=7, and we check collision on freeway 7 at turn 8.\n\nSince freeway 7 has car that covers x=0 at T=8, collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on freeway 3-8 at turn 8 or 9.\n\nIn the direct up path, at turn 8, I would be on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go faster or slower.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 3.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nAfter τ actions, at turn 3+τ, y=2 + τ, since start at 2, each U increases by 1.\n\ny_t = 2 + (t-3) for t>3 if all U, but only if I start from turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, y=2\n\nAfter a3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\n...\n\nAfter k ups, y_{3+k} = 2 + k\n\nWe want y_{3+k} =9, so 2+k=9, k=7, so at turn 10, y=9.\n\nTurn when position 9 is turn 10.\n\nNow t1 + H -1 =10, t1=3, so 3+H-1=10, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nBut during the path, at which turns am I on which freeway.\n\nTurn 3: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nTurn 4: y=3, freeway 3, safe (since T=4 not unsafe for 3)\n\nTurn 5: y=4, freeway 4, safe (T=5 safe for 4-8)\n\nTurn 6: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=7, freeway 7, but T=8 unsafe for 3-8, collision\n\nProblem at turn 8.\n\nIf I go slower, I might be later, but T=11,12 freeway 1 unsafe, but I might not be on it.\n\nIn this case, at turn 8, I need not to be on freeway 3-8.\n\nSince y=0 and 9 safe, I could go to y=0 or 9 earlier.\n\nBut y=9 is the target, I need to reach it.\n\nTo avoid being on freeway 3-8 at turn 8 and 9.\n\nTurn 8 and 9 are critical.\n\nI am at turn 3, y=2.\n\nIf I go up, by turn 7 (after 4 ups), y=6 at turn 7? Let's list:\n\nTurn 3: y=2\n\nAfter a3=U, turn4: y=3\n\na4=U, turn5: y=4\n\na5=U, turn6: y=5\n\na6=U, turn7: y=6\n\na7=U, turn8: y=7 → unsafe\n\nInstead, at some point, I can stay or move down to be on a safe freeway at turn 8 and 9.\n\nSafe freeways at turn 8 and 9: freeway 2 is always safe, freeway 1 is safe except T=4,5,11,12, so at T=8,9 freeway 1 is safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=0 is below.\n\nSo possible to be on freeway 2 at turn 8 and 9, since it is safe.\n\nOr on freeway 1, but freeway 1 might be occupied at other times.\n\nSince freeway 2 is safe, I could stay on y=2 for some turns.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, but far.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at turn K=3+H-1.\n\nSince I must increase y by 7, the minimal number of turns from start is at least 7, but with waiting, it might be more.\n\nIn the direct path, I can reach by turn 10, but I have a problem at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, if I am not on freeway 3-8, safe.\n\nFor example, if at turn 8, I am on y<=2 or y>=9, but y=9 is target.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, safe.\n\ny=1 freeway 1, but at T=8, freeway 1 is safe, since unsafe only at 4,5,11,12.\n\nSimilarly y=0 or y=9 safe.\n\nSo at turn 8, I can be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nSimilarly for turn 9.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nFrom turn 3, y=2.\n\nI need to be at y= something <=2 or >=9 at turn 8.\n\nBut since I start from 2, it might be easier to stay low or go high.\n\ny=9 is high, I need to go up eventually.\n\nLet me define the position at each turn.\n\nLet t be absolute turn.\n\nt=3: y=2\n\nNow, for t=4 to t=10, etc.\n\nI need y_t for each t.\n\nAnd for each t, when on freeway 1-8, must avoid collision.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=4,5,11,12\n\nFreeway 2 always safe\n\nFreeway 3-8 unsafe at t=8,9\n\nOthers safe.\n\nNow, I want to reach y=9 as early as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, I can be at y=9 at turn 3+7=10, with y_t=2 + (t-3) for t=4 to10, but y10=9.\n\nAt t=8, y=7 if all up, but y=7 is freeway 7, unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo I need to adjust.\n\nI could delay reaching higher freeways.\n\nFor example, stay on y=2 for some turns.\n\nAt turn 3, y=2, safe.\n\nI can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at turn 3: action a3=S, then y4=2 (since Δy=0)\n\nAt turn 4, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nThen a4=U, y5=3\n\nturn 5, y=3, freeway 3, safe (t=5 not critical for 3-8)\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nturn 6, y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nturn 7, y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na7=U, y8=6 → but at turn 8, y=6, freeway 6, unsafe! t=8 critical.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf I stay longer.\n\nSuppose at turn 3, S: y4=2\n\nturn 4: y=2, safe\n\na4=S: y5=2\n\nturn 5: y=2, safe\n\na5=U: y6=3\n\nturn 6: y=3, safe\n\na6=U: y7=4\n\nturn 7: y=4, safe\n\na7=U: y8=5 → freeway 5, unsafe at t=8\n\nStill on 5, unsafe.\n\nTo be below 3 or above 8 at t=8.\n\nFreeway 3-8 correspond to y=3 to 8.\n\nUnsafe at t=8,9 for y=3 to 8.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, etc., up to y=8 freeway 8.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, I must not be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo must be on y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\ny=9 is the target, so if I can reach y=9 by t=8, good, but from y=2 at t=3, I need to go to 9, which is 7 steps, so at least turn 10 if all up, turn 10 y=9.\n\nt=3 y=2\n\nt=4 y=3\n\n...\n\nt=10 y=9\n\nBut at t=8, if all up, y=7, which is bad.\n\nI can reach y=9 only at t=10 or later with waiting.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9 is t=10 with 7 ups.\n\nBut at t=8, I need to not be on y=3-8.\n\nSo I need to be on y<=2 or y=9 at t=8.\n\nBut y=9 at t=8 is impossible since min turn to reach is 10.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be possible but not helpful.\n\nSo I must be on y<=2 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, safe.\n\ny=1 freeway 1, but at t=8, freeway 1 is safe, since unsafe only 4,5,11,12.\n\nSimilarly y=0 safe.\n\nSo I can be on y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 later.\n\nSo let's plan.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=7, I need to be at y<=2 at t=8.\n\nt=8 position y8.\n\ny8 must be <=2 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y8 <=2.\n\nSimilarly for t=9, y9 <=2 or =9.\n\nBut since at t=9, if I am still low, I need to go up later.\n\nNow, at t=3, y=2.\n\nI can stay or move down to y=1 or 0, but y=1 might have issues at some times.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nSo at t=4 and t=5, I should not be on freeway 1 if possible.\n\nBut I can avoid.\n\nTo be at y=2 at t=8.\n\ny=2 at t=3.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 from t=3 to t=7, then at t=8, y=2.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_t is position at start of turn.\n\nAt t=3, y3=2\n\na3: if S, y4=2\n\na4: if S, y5=2\n\na5: if S, y6=2\n\na6: if S, y7=2\n\na7: if S, y8=2\n\nThen at turn 8, y8=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, I need y9 <=2 or =9.\n\nBut y9=2 if I stay.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=8, I need to go to y=9, which takes 7 ups, so y9=3, y10=4, ..., y15=9, reach at turn 15, which is late.\n\nt=3+H-1=15, so H-1=12, H=13, many turns.\n\nBut I can go up earlier, as long as at t=8 and t=9, I am low.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=2, but I am already at y=2.\n\nI can go down to y=1 or 0.\n\nBut y=1 freeway 1, which is unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=1 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at other times safe.\n\nNow, t=8 and t=9 I need to be <=2.\n\nSince t=4 and t=5 are early, I can be on y=1 at other times.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach faster.\n\nAnother idea: go up quickly to y=9 but avoid t=8,9 on middle freeways.\n\nBut to reach y=9 by t=10, I must be on y=7 at t=8, which is bad.\n\nUnless I reach earlier, but I can't, min turn 10 for y=9.\n\nt=3 y=2, after 0 actions, y=2; after 1 action, t=4 y<=3; after 2 actions, t=5 y<=4; ... after 7 actions, t=10 y=9.\n\nAt t=8, after 5 actions? Let's list positions.\n\nTurn t, y_t:\n\nt=3: y=2\n\nt=4: y = y3 + Δy3, can be 1,2,3\n\nt=5: y = y4 + Δy4, etc.\n\nI want y_t for t=8 to be <=2.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nThen after t=9, I can go up fast.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am low, I go up.\n\nNow, the critical turns are t=8 and t=9 for freeways 3-8, and t=4,5 for freeway 1, but t=4,5 are early.\n\nAlso t=11,12 for freeway 1, but later.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go as up as possible before t=8, but not on y=3-8 at t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I can be on y=2, then at t=8, y=2.\n\ny at t=7 can be up to, say, 6, but if y7=6, then if I go down, y8=5, but y=5 at t=8 unsafe, bad.\n\nTo be safe at t=8, y8 <=2 or 9.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nSince 9 not possible, y8 <=2.\n\nSimilarly, y9 <=2 or 9.\n\nBut if y8 <=2, and I go up, y9 could be 3, but at t=9, y=3 is unsafe, so if y9=3, collision.\n\nTherefore, at t=9, I must also have y9 <=2 or 9.\n\nBut if y8 <=2, and I do nothing, y9=y8<=2, safe.\n\nIf I go up from y8<=2, y9 = y8 +1 <=3, which could be 3, unsafe if y9=3.\n\nIf y8=2, U, y9=3, then at t=9, on freeway 3, unsafe.\n\nIf y8=1, U, y9=2, safe.\n\nIf y8=0, U, y9=1, which may be safe if not t=4 or5.\n\nBut at t=9, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if y8=2, D, y9=1, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSo to avoid y9=3,4,5,6,7,8 at t=9, I must have y9 <=2 or 9.\n\nSince 9 not possible, y9 <=2.\n\nThus, both y8 and y9 must be <=2.\n\nThen after that, I can go up to 9.\n\nNow, from t=3 to t=7, I can move, but need to ensure that at t=8 and t=9, y<=2.\n\nAlso, during t=4 to t=7, I need to avoid collision, but freeway 2 safe, freeway 1 safe except t=4,5, etc.\n\nFirst, let's set y8=2 and y9=2.\n\nThen from t=3 to t=7, I need to arrive at y=2 at t=8.\n\ny8 is determined by a7.\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7\n\nBut y7 is position at t=7.\n\nI need y8 <=2, and since I want to be at y=2, set y8=2.\n\nSimilarly y9=2.\n\nSo from t=3 to t=7, I can be at various y, but end up at y=2 at t=8.\n\nThe simplest is to stay at y=2 from t=3 to t=8.\n\nBut at t=3, I am at y=2, I can stay.\n\nActions:\n\na3=S: y4=2\n\na4=S: y5=2\n\na5=S: y6=2\n\na6=S: y7=2\n\na7=S: y8=2\n\nThen at turn 8, y=2, safe.\n\nNow for turn 9, I need y9 <=2.\n\nIf I continue stay, a8=S, y9=2, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up from turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, y9=2, I can go up.\n\na9=U, y10=3\n\nNow turn 10, y=3, freeway 3, but at t=10, is it unsafe?\n\nFreeways 3-8 unsafe only at t=8,9, t=10 is safe for all, since t=10>9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 unsafe only at 4,5,11,12, t=10 safe.\n\nSo at turn 10, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=4\n\nturn 11, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nBut at turn 11, freeway 1 is unsafe, but I am on freeway 4, so no issue.\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nturn 12, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nturn 13, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\nturn 14, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\nturn 15, y=8, freeway 8, safe? At t=15, not critical, safe.\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nThen at turn 16, y=9, reached.\n\nBut this is turn 16, which is t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1=16, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nBut earlier with direct, I could reach at turn 10 but had problem.\n\nNow, after t=9, I can go up faster.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=9, I can go up every turn.\n\nt=9: y9=2\n\na9=U, y10=3\n\nt=10: y10=3, safe\n\na10=U, y11=4\n\nt=11: y11=4, safe (freeway 4, not 1)\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y12=5, safe\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y13=6, safe\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y14=7, safe\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y15=8, safe\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nt=16: y16=9, reached.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=11 and t=12, freeway 1 is unsafe, but I am on higher freeways, so ok.\n\nTo reach faster, I need to be higher before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, I must be low, I can be higher at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I can be at y=6, but then to be safe at t=8, I need to move down or something.\n\nSuppose at t=7, y7=6.\n\nThen at turn 8, if I am on y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo I can choose action at t=7 to go down, so y8 = y7 + Δy, if Δy = -1, y8=5, but y=5 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 or 2.\n\nBut from y=6, if I go down, y8=5 if D, but unsafe; or if S, y8=6, unsafe; if U, y8=7, worse.\n\nSo from y=6 at t=7, I cannot reach y<=2 at t=8 with one action, since y8 = y7 + Δy, with Δy >= -1, so y8 >=5, which is in 3-8, unsafe at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if y7=5, y8 >=4, still in 3-8.\n\nIf y7=4, y8 >=3, same.\n\nIf y7=3, y8 >=2.\n\ny8=2 is ok, but y8=3 is unsafe.\n\nSo to have y8=2, I need y7 <=2, so that with Δy >= -1, y8 >=1, but if y7=2, y8=1,2,3; if y7=1, y8=0,1,2; if y7=0, y8=0,1.\n\nBut y8 must be <=2, which is possible only if y7 <=2.\n\nIf y7=2, I can have y8=2 by S, or y8=1 by D, or y8=3 by U.\n\nBut y8=3 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y7=1, y8=0,1,2 all <=2.\n\nBut to have y8<=2, I need y7 <=2.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier turns.\n\nIn fact, to have y8<=2, since actions can decrease by at most 1 per turn, from t=3 y=2, I can stay or decrease, but not increase above 2 if I want y8<=2.\n\nIf I increase, I might be higher.\n\nFor example, at t=3, y=2, if I go up, y4=3, then I am higher.\n\nThen to have y8<=2, I need to decrease later, but it takes time.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=3, U: y4=3\n\nThen at t=4, y=3\n\nIf I go down, a4=D, y5=2\n\nThen y5=2\n\nThen I can stay, but at t=8, if I stay from t=5 to t=7, y8=2.\n\nBut let's see the path:\n\nt=3: y=2, safe\n\na3=U: y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, at t=4, is it safe? Yes, as earlier.\n\na4=D: y5=2\n\nt=5: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\na5=S: y6=2\n\nt=6: y=2, safe\n\na6=S: y7=2\n\nt=7: y=2, safe\n\na7=S: y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, safe\n\na8=S: y9=2\n\nt=9: y=2, safe\n\nThen from here, go up: a9=U, y10=3\n\nt=10: y=3, safe\n\na10=U, y11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, safe\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, safe\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, safe\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nt=16: y=9, reached.\n\nStill turn 16.\n\nBut I reached at turn 16, same as before.\n\nBut I used one up and one down, net zero, so same time.\n\nTo reach faster, I need to be higher when possible.\n\nFor example, after t=9, I can go up, but t=10 to t=16, 7 turns to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nBut I can be higher before t=8.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=2 at t=3, but I am at 2.\n\nGo up to y=3 or 4 at early turns, but then before t=8, I need to be at y<=2.\n\nFor example, at t=3, U: y4=3\n\nt=4, U: y5=4\n\nt=5, U: y6=5\n\nt=6, U: y7=6\n\nNow at t=7, y=6\n\nI need y8<=2, but from y=6, with one action, y8 >=5, cannot be <=2.\n\nSo impossible to reach y8<=2 from y7=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I stop earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=3, U: y4=3\n\nt=4, U: y5=4\n\nt=5, S: y6=4  (stay)\n\nt=6, D: y7=3  (down)\n\nt=7, D: y8=2\n\nThen y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, safe\n\na8=S: y9=2\n\nt=9: y=2, safe\n\nThen go up: a9=U, y10=3\n\netc, same as before, reach at t=16.\n\nStill late.\n\nBut at t=5, y=4, I could go down directly.\n\nBut net, from t=3 to t=8, I moved from 2 to 2, no progress.\n\nThen from t=9 to t=16 to 9.\n\nTotal turns from start to reach: turn 16.\n\nBut with direct, I could reach at turn 10 but collision at t=8.\n\nUnless I can be on y=9 at t=8 or something, impossible.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 or 1 to avoid, but not helpful.\n\nOr, since freeway 1 is safe at most times, I can be on y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut still, I need to go up.\n\nTo save time, I can go up between t=4 and t=5, but t=4 and t=5 freeway 1 is unsafe, so I should not be on y=1 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nFor example, at t=3, I can go down to y=1, but at t=4, if on y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I can go down at t=3: a3=D, y4=1\n\nBut at turn 4, y=1, freeway 1, and t=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nBad.\n\nGo down later, but not useful.\n\nSo best to stay on y=2 until after t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I can start going up.\n\nBut at t=11 and t=12, freeway 1 is unsafe, but if I am on y=1 at that time, problem, but I can avoid being on y=1 at t=11,12.\n\nIn the up path, I am on higher freeways.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=9, I go up to y=3 at t=10, etc., so at t=11, I am on y=4 or something, not freeway 1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut the reaching turn is late.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 10 if I can avoid collision at t=8, but I can't if I am on y=7.\n\nUnless I am not on the freeway at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, if I am on y=2, but I need to be at y=9 at turn 10, which requires y10=9, so at t=9, y9=8 or 9, but if y9=8, at t=9, on freeway 8, unsafe.\n\nIf I can have y9=9, then at t=9, on y=9, safe, and reached.\n\nBut to have y9=9 at t=9, from y=2 at t=3, I need to increase by 7 in 6 turns (from t=3 to t=9, actions at t=3 to t=8 affect y4 to y9).\n\ny9 is determined by actions from a3 to a8.\n\na3 affects y4, a4 affects y5, ..., a8 affects y9.\n\nSo with 6 actions, I can change y by net up to +6 or down to -6, but I need +7, impossible.\n\nMax y9: start from y3=2, each action U, y4=3, y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8.\n\nSo y9=8 at best, not 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, y10=9 with 7 ups.\n\nBut at turn 8, y8=7 if all up, or less with waiting.\n\nBut y8=7 at t=8 is unsafe.\n\nTo have y8 safe, y8<=2 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y8<=2.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, for y9, if y8<=2, and I go up, y9<=3, which at t=9, if y9=3, unsafe, so I must have y9<=2 or 9.\n\nSince 9 impossible, y9<=2.\n\nThen at turn 10, I can go to y=3, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=2 at t=9, I need 7 steps, so y16=9.\n\nEarliest possible is turn 10 with y10=9, but not achievable with safety at t=8.\n\nSo with safety, earliest is turn 16 with the above paths.\n\nBut that seems too late; perhaps I can be on y=1 at some point.\n\nFor example, after t=9, I go up, but I can go faster if I am higher before.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=2 at t=3, but stay.\n\nOr, at t=3, since freeway 2 safe, I can stay.\n\nBut let's accept that I need to be low at t=8,9.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible before t=8 without being on 3-8 at t=8, but since at t=7, if I am high, I can't get low fast.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I must be at y<=2 to have y8<=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, to have y7<=2, etc.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=7, I can be at most y=2, because if I go up, I am higher and can't get back to <=2 at t=8 without being unsafe at t=8.\n\nFor instance, if at t=6, y6=2, then a6=S, y7=2; a7=S, y8=2.\n\nIf at t=6, y6=3, then to have y7<=2, I can a6=D, y7=2; then a7=S, y8=2.\n\nBut at t=7, y7=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I am higher at earlier turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=3: y3=2\n\na3=U: y4=3\n\nt=4: y4=3, freeway 3, at t=4 safe (not critical)\n\na4=D: y5=2  (down to 2)\n\nt=5: y5=2, freeway 2, safe\n\na5=S: y6=2\n\nt=6: y6=2, safe\n\na6=S: y7=2\n\nt=7: y7=2, safe\n\na7=S: y8=2\n\nt=8: y8=2, safe\n\na8=S: y9=2\n\nt=9: y9=2, safe\n\nThen from here, go up: a9=U, y10=3\n\na10=U, y11=4\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nt=16: y16=9\n\nReached at turn 16.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=4, I was at y=3, which is safe.\n\nNow, to save one turn, I can go up at t=9 immediately.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, turn 10 to 16.\n\nTurn 10 y=3, ..., turn 16 y=9.\n\nCan I be at higher y at t=10?\n\nFor example, at t=9, y9=2, I can only go to y10=3.\n\nIf at t=9, I am at y=1, then y10=2, worse.\n\nOr if at t=8, I am at y=2, but I can go up at t=8: a8=U, y9=3, but at t=9, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe! Because t=9 critical for 3-8.\n\nSo I cannot do that; y9 must be <=2 or 9.\n\nSo I have to have y9<=2.\n\nThus, the earliest to start going up is from t=9 with y9=2, to y10=3, ..., y16=9.\n\nReach at turn 16.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn when reached: turn 16, which is t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1=16, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nH is the number of turns, with actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions from turn 3 to turn 15, that's 13 actions? Turns from 3 to 15 inclusive is 13 turns.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so absolute turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 16, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =3 + H -1 =16, so 2+H=16, H=14.\n\nActions from turn 3 to turn 3+13=16? t1 to t1+H-1=3 to 3+13=16? t1+H-1=3+14-1=16, yes.\n\nActions at turn 3 to turn 16, but action at turn 16 affects y17, but since we reach at turn 16, we don't care, but we need to specify up to a_{t1+H-1} = a_16.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 16, we can set a16=S or U, but since we are at 9, S is fine.\n\nBut in the path above, at turn 15, a15=U sets y16=9, so at turn 16, position is 9, and we can have a16=S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include a16.\n\nNow, but this is not minimal; I think I can do better by being on y=1 or 0 at t=8 and 9, but it doesn't save time.\n\nOr, since at t=6 and t=7, I can be higher, but then I have to come down.\n\nFor example, at t=3, U: y4=3\n\nt=4, U: y5=4\n\nt=5, U: y6=5\n\nt=6, D: y7=4  (down)\n\nt=7, D: y8=3  (down to 3)\n\nBut at t=8, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe! Bad.\n\nIf I go down to 2: t=7, from y7, if y6=5, a6=D, y7=4; then a7=D, y8=3, still unsafe.\n\nTo get to y=2 at t=8, from y6=5, I need two downs: a6=D, y7=4; a7=D, y8=3, not 2.\n\ny8=3, unsafe.\n\nIf I start down earlier.\n\nSuppose t=3, U: y4=3\n\nt=4, U: y5=4\n\nt=5, D: y6=3\n\nt=6, D: y7=2\n\nt=7, S: y8=2\n\nThen y8=2, safe.\n\nt=8: y=2\n\na8=S: y9=2\n\nt=9: y=2\n\nThen go up same as before.\n\nBut from t=3 to t=8, I did two up and two down, net zero, same as staying.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 14, reaching at turn 16.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach at turn 10 with a different path.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=2 at t=3, but I am at 2.\n\nOr, I can go to y=9 via freeway 1 at safe times.\n\nBut freeway 1 unsafe at t=4,5,11,12.\n\nFor example, at t=3, I can go to y=1: a3=D, y4=1, but at t=4, on y=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nGo to y=1 at other times.\n\nBut at t=3, y=2, if I go down at t=3, collision at t=4.\n\nIf I go down later, say at t=4, but at t=4, if I am on y=2 or 3, etc.\n\nSuppose at t=3, S: y4=2\n\nt=4, S: y5=2  (not on y=1 at t=4,5)\n\nt=5, D: y6=1  (down to 1)\n\nt=6: y=1, freeway 1, at t=6, u=3, for freeway 1, at T=6, earlier we had car3 at u=1,2 only, car1 at u=8,9, so at T=6, no car covers, safe.\n\na6=S: y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1, safe\n\na7=U: y8=2  (up to 2)\n\nt=8: y=2, safe\n\na8=S: y9=2\n\nt=9: y=2, safe\n\nThen from here, same as before, go up to 9 by turn 16.\n\nNo gain.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=7, I can go up to y=2 at t=8, but still.\n\nOr at t=9, I can be at y=1, but then go up from there.\n\nStill takes 7 steps to 9.\n\nSo I think turn 16 is the earliest possible with safety.\n\nBut let's check if I can be at y=9 at turn 10 by being on safe freeways.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, I need to be on y<=2 or 9, impossible.\n\nAt turn 9, similarly.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn 10, and at turn 10 with all up, I have problem at turn 8.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I go up after t=9, I can reach faster if I start from higher, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: after t=9, at t=10, I am at y=3, but I can go up faster, no.\n\nOr, since freeway 1 is safe at t=10, I can be on y=1, but not helpful.\n\nI think I have to accept H=14.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the first plan where I stay at 2 until t=8.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1=3: action a3 = S  (since y4=2)\n\nTurn 4: a4 = S  (y5=2)\n\nTurn 5: a5 = S  (y6=2)\n\nTurn 6: a6 = S  (y7=2)\n\nTurn 7: a7 = S  (y8=2)\n\nTurn 8: a8 = S  (y9=2)\n\nTurn 9: a9 = U  (y10=3)\n\nTurn 10: a10 = U  (y11=4)\n\nTurn 11: a11 = U  (y12=5)\n\nTurn 12: a12 = U  (y13=6)\n\nTurn 13: a13 = U  (y14=7)\n\nTurn 14: a14 = U  (y15=8)\n\nTurn 15: a15 = U  (y16=9)\n\nNow, at turn 16, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from turn 3 to turn 15, that's 13 actions.\n\nH is the number, so actions for t=0 to H-1, from turn 3 to 3+H-1.\n\n3 to 3+H-1 inclusive is H turns.\n\nAt turn 3+H-1, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 15, position y15=8, then a15=U sets y16=9, so at turn 16, position is 9.\n\nTurn 16 is turn t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 16, so 3+H-1=16, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions from a3 to a_{3+13} = a_{16}? t1 to t1+H-1=3 to 3+13=16? 3+13=16, yes a3 to a16.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have actions from a3 to a15, which is up to turn 15, affecting up to y16.\n\nBut for turn t1+H-1=16, we need action a16 as well.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 16, we can set a16=S, since we are at 9.\n\nSo add a16=S.\n\nBut it doesn't affect.\n\nNow, the reaching turn is turn 16.\n\nBut in the sequence, when we take a15 at turn 15, it sets y16, so at turn 16, we are at 9.\n\nThen a16 can be S.\n\nTo have fewer actions, but I think 14 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 10 if I go to y=9 at turn 10 but avoid being on y=7 at t=8 by being on a different freeway, but at t=8, if I am on y=7, it is freeway 7, which is unsafe, no way around.\n\nUnless I am not on the grid at that turn, but I have to be somewhere.\n\nSo I think it's impossible before turn 16.\n\nBut let's check the car on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has only one car, which never covers x=0, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, only specific times.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 8 and 9, freeways 3-8 are unsafe, but freeway 2 is safe, freeway 1 is safe at that time, so I can be on y=1 or 2 or 0 or 9.\n\nBut since I can't be on 9, I am on 0,1,2.\n\nThen after that, I go up.\n\nBut to go from y=2 to y=9 takes 7 turns, from turn 9 to turn 16.\n\nTurn 9 y=2, turn 10 y=3, ..., turn 16 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier if I am on freeway 1 at safe times.\n\nFor example, after t=5, freeway 1 is safe until t=11.\n\nFrom t=6 to t=10, freeway 1 safe.\n\nAt t=3, y=2, I can stay or move.\n\nSuppose at t=3, S: y4=2\n\nt=4, S: y5=2  (avoid y=1 at t=4,5)\n\nt=5, U: y6=3\n\nBut at t=6, y=3, I can go to y=1: a5=D? t=5 action a5.\n\nAt t=5, y5=2, I can a5=D, y6=1\n\nt=6: y=1, freeway 1, at t=6 safe\n\na6=U: y7=2\n\nt=7: y=2, safe\n\na7=U: y8=3, but at t=8, y=3, unsafe! Bad.\n\na7=S: y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, safe\n\na8=U: y9=3, but at t=9, y=3, unsafe\n\nMust have y9<=2.\n\nSo a8=S: y9=2\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the minimal H is 14.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nStart at turn 3, y=2.\n\nTo be at y=2 at turn 8 and 9, then go up.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: S  (stay, y4=2)\n\nTurn 4: S  (y5=2)\n\nTurn 5: S  (y6=2)\n\nTurn 6: S  (y7=2)\n\nTurn 7: S  (y8=2)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y9=2)\n\nNow at turn 9, y=2\n\nThen go up:\n\nTurn 9: U  (y10=3)\n\nTurn 10: U  (y11=4)\n\nTurn 11: U  (y12=5)\n\nTurn 12: U  (y13=6)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y14=7)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y15=8)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y16=9)\n\nNow, at turn 16, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from turn 3 to turn 15, that's 13 actions, but H should include up to turn 15.\n\nH is the number such that we reach at turn t1+H-1=3+H-1.\n\nSet 3+H-1=16, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions: a3 to a_{3+13} = a_{16}? t1 to t1+H-1=3 to 3+13=16.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have up to a15, which is for turn 15, affecting y16.\n\nFor turn 16, we need to specify a16, which can be S.\n\nSo add Turn 16: S\n\nBut since we reached at turn 16, and a16 doesn't change position, it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at the turn when we reach.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 15, action U sets y16=9, so we reach at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, we can have action S.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce H.\n\nSuppose at turn 7, I am at y=2, a7=U, but then y8=3, unsafe at t=8.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, after t=9, I can go up, but at t=11,12 freeway 1 unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 10 by being on y=9 at turn 10, but to have y10=9, from y3=2, with actions a3 to a9, 7 actions.\n\na3 to a9 is 7 actions, affecting y4 to y10.\n\nWith all U, y4=3, y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nSo at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 8, y8=7, on freeway 7, unsafe.\n\nIf I can have y8 not 7, but if I stay or move down, y10 not 9.\n\nFor example, if at some point I stay, then y10<9.\n\nSo impossible to have y10=9 without y8=7.\n\nAnd y8=7 unsafe.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach at turn 10 with safety.\n\nSimilarly for turn 11: to have y11=9, with actions from a3 to a10.\n\nWith all U, y4=3, y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9, y11=10>9, not allowed, y max 9.\n\ny must be in 0-9, so at y9=8, a9=U, y10=9.\n\nOr if I reach earlier, but can't.\n\nTo have y11=9, I can be at y10=9 or 8 or 9.\n\nIf y10=9, then at turn 10, y=9, reached.\n\nBut same as turn 10.\n\nIf not, y11=9 from y10=9 with S, or from y10=8 with U.\n\nBut in any case, to have y10=9 or y11=9, I need to be at high y at turn 8 or 9, which is unsafe if on 3-8.\n\nFor example, to have y10=9, I need y9=8 or 9, but at turn 9, y=8 or 9, if y=8, on freeway 8, unsafe; if y=9, safe, but can't reach by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, to have y11=9, I need y10=8 or 9.\n\nAt turn 10, y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y=8, on freeway 8, but at t=10, freeway 8 is safe, since critical only t=8,9.\n\nt=10>9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if y=9, safe.\n\nBut to have y10=8 or 9, from start, with actions.\n\nFor example, all U from t=3: y4=3, y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nThen at turn 8, y8=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I have y9=8, then at turn 9, y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo to have y10=8 or 9, I must have y8=7 or less, but with up, y8=7 if all up.\n\nIf I stay at some point, y8<7, then y10<9.\n\nSo only way is y8=7, but unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach at turn 10 or 11 with safety; the earliest safe reach is turn 16.\n\nSo for the sequence, I'll go with the one I have.\n\nIn the sequence, I can start going up after t=8, but at t=9 I need to be low.\n\nIn my sequence, I go up from t=9.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3, position (0,2)\n\nCar state as given.\n\nMinimal H=14\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAt turn 15, action U sets y16=9, so at turn 16, position is 9.\n\nThen for turn 16, action S, but since we reached, it's included.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn t1+H-1=16.\n\nSo 14 actions from turn 3 to 16.\n\nTurn 3 to 16 is 14 turns.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S  (optional, but to have the action)\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision.\n\nAt no point am I on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, from turn 3 to 8, on y=2, freeway 2, always safe.\n\nTurn 9, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nTurn 10, y=3, freeway 3, at t=10 safe.\n\nSimilarly up to turn 15, y=8, freeway 8, at t=15 safe.\n\nTurn 16, y=9, no car.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut is there a way with less?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at some point to save time, but I don't see how.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, if I am at y=1, then I need 8 steps to y=9, worse.\n\nOr at turn 8, y=1, then turn 9 y=2, then go up.\n\nStill turn 17 or something.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=14 is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 14. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying on the safe freeway \\(y = 2\\) during the dangerous turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (when freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) have cars covering \\(x = 0\\)) and \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\) (when freeway \\(y = 1\\) has cars covering \\(x = 0\\)). Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is always safe because the car on it never covers \\(x = 0\\). After turn 9, the player moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\) without encountering any dangerous situations.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 3 to turn 16 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 14 - 1 = 16\\)) is as follows:\n\n- Turns 3 to 8: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), avoiding freeways 3-8 at turns 8 and 9, and freeway 1 at turns 4 and 5.\n- Turns 9 to 15: Move up (U) to increase \\(y\\) from 2 to 9.\n- Turn 16: Stay (S) since the target \\(y = 9\\) is reached; no further action is needed, but it is included to complete the sequence.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 3: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2).\n- Turns 4 to 8: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2).\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2).\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 not dangerous at \\(t = 10\\)).\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, freeway 4 not dangerous at \\(t = 11\\)).\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5 not dangerous at \\(t = 12\\)).\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 not dangerous at \\(t = 13\\)).\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 not dangerous at \\(t = 14\\)).\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 not dangerous at \\(t = 15\\)).\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 9\\) (reached, no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible because reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 would require being on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8 (unsafe), and adjusting the path to avoid this forces a delay until after turn 9.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=2 and need to get to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and the player's x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y. Only at the next turn (if we don't move) or when we move, the position changes. So when we take an action at turn T, the position at turn T is the current y, and then we update to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThus, when we are at position y at turn T, we check the freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) for any car that has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=4. For each freeway, we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\nFor a left-moving car (which we don't have any in this problem, all are right-moving?): \n  - The initial span is [h, τ] and then moves left: h - s*(T-t1) to τ - s*(T-t1)\n\nBut in the problem, the cars are given as:\n  - Left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at T\n  - Right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T\n\nWait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse:\n\nIn the car state table:\n  For freeway 1: \n      (-42, -53, right, 6) -> so for a right-moving car, the initial span (at t1=4) is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? \n      But the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So head is -42 and tail is -53? \n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: \n  span(t1) = [τ, h] -> so in this case τ is the tail and h is the head? \n\nLooking at the example: \n  \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo the car at t1 has its tail at τ and head at h, and then moves to the right.\n\nBut in the data, the car is given as (h, τ, d, s). So the first number is head, the second is tail.\n\nTherefore, for a right-moving car:\n  initial head = h, tail = τ -> so the span at t1 is [τ, h] (because the tail is behind and the head is in front when moving right). \n\nBut note: if the car is moving right, then at t1, the car occupies from τ to h, and then at T, it occupies [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  initial head = h, tail = τ -> then the car at t1 is from h to τ (but since it's moving left, the head is on the left? Actually, the update rule says: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the data for freeway 1, we have a car: (-42, -53, right, 6). \n  So head = -42, tail = -53 -> meaning at t1=4, the car is from -53 to -42 (because for right-moving, the tail is at -53 and head at -42). \n\nBut wait: if the car is moving right, then at t1=4, it is at [τ, h] = [-53, -42]. Then at turn T, it will be at [ -53 + 6*(T-4), -42 + 6*(T-4) ].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 1: (36,25,right,6) -> head=36, tail=25? That doesn't make sense because 25<36, so the span would be [25,36] at t1=4. And then at T, [25+6*(T-4), 36+6*(T-4)].\n\nBut note: there's also (0,-11,right,6) on freeway1: so [ -11, 0 ] at t1=4? Then at T, [-11+6*(T-4), 0+6*(T-4)].\n\nWe must avoid having 0 in the span of a car on the freeway we are on at the same turn.\n\nPlan: We are at y=2 at turn 4. We need to go to y=9. We can only change by at most 1 per turn. So at least 7 turns (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid the freeways at the exact turn when we are on them.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway we step on (when y is between 1 and 8) at the exact turn, that no car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 4 onward.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe note that we start at turn4 at y=2. We can do:\n\n  t=4: y=2 -> then we take an action to go to y=3? or stay? or down? but down to 1 is worse.\n\nWe need to get to 9. So we must go up mostly.\n\nBut we have to check the freeways:\n\nWe are currently at turn4 at y=2. But note: the freeway y=2 is freeway2. We must check freeway2 at turn4.\n\nFreeway2 has one car: (-48,-83,right,36). So at turn4, the car is at [-83, -48] (because tail=-83, head=-48). Then at turn4, 0 is in [-83,-48]? No, because 0 is greater than -48? Actually, -48 is negative, and 0 is positive, so 0 is not in [-83,-48]. So at turn4, we are safe on freeway2.\n\nBut note: we are at turn4 at y=2. Then we take an action for turn4. The action at turn4 will determine y5.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nLet me denote T as the absolute turn (starting at t1=4).\n\nWe need to compute the car positions at each turn T for each freeway.\n\nBut note: the cars are only on freeways 1 to 8. When we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't check because those are not freeways? Actually, the problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\". So at y=0 and y=9, no cars. So we are safe there.\n\nGoal: get to y=9.\n\nWe are at turn T=4: y4=2.\n\nWe consider the actions: U, D, S. But D to 1 would be bad because we are going down, but we need to go up. So probably we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nLet me list the freeways we must pass: we are at 2, then 3,4,5,6,7,8, then 9. So we must step on freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at least once? Actually, we step on a freeway when we are at that y at a turn.\n\nWe can skip a freeway by moving two steps in one turn? No, because we can only move by 1 per turn. So we must step on every integer from 2 to 8 at some turn.\n\nBut note: we can stay at a freeway for multiple turns? But that would increase H. We want minimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7: going from 2 to 9 in 7 steps (each step up). So actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U. Then we are at 9 at turn 4+7 = 11? \n\nWait: \n  Turn4: start at 2.\n  Turn4 action: U -> at turn5, y=3.\n  Turn5 action: U -> turn6, y=4.\n  ... until turn10: y=8 -> then turn11: U -> y=9.\n\nSo at turn11, we are at y=9. So H=7? Because from turn4 to turn10 we do 6 actions? Let me count:\n\n  We start at turn4 at y=2.\n  We take 7 actions: at turn4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -> then at turn11 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=7? But the sequence is from t=4 to t=4+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning:\n\n  t=0: a_{t1} = a4\n  t=1: a5\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{4+H-1}\n\nAnd after H actions, we are at turn t1+H? and the position is (0,9) at that turn? \n\nActually, the position after H actions: \n  We start at turn t1 at y0 (which is given). Then after the first action (at t1) we are at turn t1+1 at y1, then ... until after H actions, we are at turn t1+H at y_H.\n\nWe require y_H = 9.\n\nSo if we start at turn4 at y=2, and we take 7 actions (each U), then:\n\n  Turn4: U -> turn5: y=3\n  Turn5: U -> turn6: y=4\n  Turn6: U -> turn7: y=5\n  Turn7: U -> turn8: y=6\n  Turn8: U -> turn9: y=7\n  Turn9: U -> turn10: y=8\n  Turn10: U -> turn11: y=9\n\nSo at turn11 we are at y=9. So H=7.\n\nBut we must check that at every turn from turn4 to turn10, we are not colliding? Actually, note:\n\n  At turn4: we are at y=2 (freeway2) -> check freeway2 at turn4: safe as above.\n\n  Then we take action at turn4 to go to y=3 at turn5.\n\n  At turn5: we are at y=3 -> check freeway3 at turn5.\n\n  At turn6: y=4 -> check freeway4 at turn6.\n\n  and so on until turn10: we are at y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn10.\n\n  Then at turn11 we are at y=9 (safe).\n\nSo we must check freeway k at turn T when we are at that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=4) the positions of the cars on that freeway.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the freeway we are on at the turn we are on.\n\nSo for the plan of 7 U's:\n\n  T=4: y=2 -> freeway2: car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> at T=4: [τ, h] = [-83, -48]. 0 is not in [-83,-48]? -> safe.\n\n  T=5: y=3 -> freeway3: cars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6) -> wait, note: the car representation is (head, tail, ...). So for the first car: head=-24, tail=-35 -> so at T=4 (the given state) the car is at [τ, h] = [-35, -24]. But we are at T=5.\n\n  How to compute at T=5? \n      For the first car: \n          at T=5: τ' = τ + s*(5-4) = -35 + 6*1 = -29, h' = -24 + 6*1 = -18 -> so [-29,-18]. 0 is not in this interval? -> safe.\n      Second car: (24,13,right,6) -> head=24, tail=13 -> at T=4: [13,24]. Then at T=5: [13+6, 24+6] = [19,30]. 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  T=6: y=4 -> freeway4: same cars as freeway3? Actually, the table says freeway4 has the same cars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6). So same as freeway3? \n\n      First car at T=6: [-35 + 6*(6-4) = -35+12 = -23, -24+12 = -12] -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n      Second car: [13+12,24+12] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n  T=7: y=5 -> freeway5: same cars again? \n      First car: [-35+6*(7-4)= -35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> [-17,-6] -> 0 is not in? (since -6 is negative, 0 is not included) -> safe.\n      Second car: [13+18,24+18]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\n  T=8: y=6 -> freeway6: same cars.\n      First car: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> [-11,0]. Now, 0 is included? The span is [-11,0] -> so if 0 is the head? The problem says: collision if 0 is in the span. So 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because it's a closed interval? The problem doesn't specify open or closed, but typically such spans are closed. \n\n      So at T=8, on freeway6, the first car's span is [-11,0] -> which includes 0 -> collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go straight up, at turn8 (which is T=8) we are at y=6 and we collide with the car on freeway6.\n\nSo we cannot go straight up.\n\nWe need to avoid that collision.\n\nWhat can we do? We can try to delay or advance our arrival at freeway6 so that at the turn we are on freeway6, the car is not covering 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip that turn by staying or moving down? But we don't want to move down because we need to go up.\n\nWe can also consider waiting at a safe freeway for one turn.\n\nSo let's analyze the car on freeway6 (and similarly for others because they are symmetric?).\n\nThe first car on freeway6: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=6). At turn T, the car is at:\n  [ -35 + 6*(T-4), -24 + 6*(T-4) ]\n\nWe are at freeway6 at turn T (if we get there at that turn). We must avoid having 0 in [ -35+6*(T-4), -24+6*(T-4) ].\n\nSet:\n  -35 + 6*(T-4) <= 0 <= -24 + 6*(T-4)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n  Lower bound: -35 + 6*(T-4) <= 0  => 6*(T-4) <= 35 => T-4 <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833 => T <= 9.833 -> so T<=9 (if T integer)\n  Upper bound: 0 <= -24 + 6*(T-4) => 6*(T-4) >= 24 => T-4>=4 => T>=8.\n\nSo for T in [8,9] (since T is integer) the car covers 0? \n\n  T=8: as above: -35+24 = -11, -24+24=0 -> [ -11, 0] -> includes 0.\n  T=9: -35+6*5=-35+30=-5, -24+30=6 -> [-5,6] -> includes 0? 0 is between -5 and 6 -> yes.\n\n  T=10: -35+36=1, -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  T=7: -35+18=-17, -24+18=-6 -> [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nSo the car covers 0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway6 at turns 8 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, note that the same car pattern is on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8? Actually, the table:\n\n  Freeway3: same two cars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6)\n  Freeway4: same\n  Freeway5: same\n  Freeway6: same\n  Freeway7: same\n  Freeway8: same\n\nBut freeway1 and 2 are different.\n\nFreeway1 has three cars: \n  (-42,-53,right,6) -> at T: [-53+6*(T-4), -42+6*(T-4)]\n  (36,25,right,6) -> [25+6*(T-4), 36+6*(T-4)]\n  (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*(T-4), 0+6*(T-4)]\n\nAnd freeway2 has one car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> [-83+36*(T-4), -48+36*(T-4)]\n\nWe are currently at turn4 at y=2 (freeway2) -> safe.\n\nNow, we plan to go to y=3 at turn5, then y=4 at turn6, etc.\n\nBut we know that at freeway6, we cannot be at turn8 or 9.\n\nWe have two options:\n\nOption 1: Adjust the timing so that we are at freeway6 at a safe turn (T=7,10,11,...). But note T=7: we would be at freeway6 at turn7? But then we are going up: at turn7 we would be at y=5 (if we started at turn4: 4->2, 5->3, 6->4, 7->5). So to be at freeway6 at turn7, we would have to be at y=6 at turn7. But from y=2 at turn4 to y=6 at turn7: that's 4 steps? So we would have to go up faster? But we can only do one per turn. So we need at least 4 steps to go from 2 to 6. \n\n  Turn4: start at 2 -> then turn4: U -> turn5: 3\n  turn5: U -> turn6: 4\n  turn6: U -> turn7: 5 -> not 6.\n\nTo be at 6 at turn7, we would have to go from 2 to 6 in 3 actions? That's impossible because 3 actions only get us to 5.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway6 at turn7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at freeway6 at turn10: \n  We can be at y=6 at turn10. But that would be 6 steps from 2: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8? Then at turn10 we are at y=8? \n\nWe need to plan:\n\n  We can slow down: for example, we can stay at some safe freeway for one turn.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn4.\n\nWe want to avoid being at freeway6 at turn8 and 9.\n\nThe freeway6 is at y=6.\n\nWe can either:\n\n  a) Get to y=6 earlier than turn8? -> impossible as above.\n\n  b) Get to y=6 after turn9? -> so at turn10 or later.\n\nBut then we have to spend extra turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip freeway6? But we cannot skip because we must step on every integer from 2 to 8.\n\nWe must step on freeway6 at some turn. The safe turns for freeway6 are T<=7 or T>=10? But T<=7: we cannot get there by turn7? So we must use T>=10.\n\nSo we plan to be at freeway6 at turn10 or later.\n\nBut note: we also have to worry about the other freeways? For example, freeway5: same cars. When is freeway5 dangerous?\n\nFor freeway5: the same car: [-35+6*(T-4), -24+6*(T-4)] covers 0 when T in [8,9]? \n\n  T=8: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> covers 0? -> but wait: freeway5 at T=8: the car is at [-11,0] -> so if we are at freeway5 at T=8, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: [-35+30=-5, -24+30=6] -> covers 0.\n\nSo freeway5 is dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: dangerous at T=8,9? \n  T=8: [-35+24=-11,0] -> covers 0? -> yes.\n  T=9: [-5,6] -> yes.\n\nAnd freeway3: same.\n\nFreeway7: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway8: same -> dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nSo actually, every freeway from 3 to 8 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on any freeway from 3 to 8 at turns 8 and 9.\n\nThat means at turn8 and turn9, we must be at y=0 or y=9 or y=1 or y=2? But note:\n\n  We start at y=2 at turn4. We need to get to y=9.\n\n  At turn8 and turn9, we must be at a safe y: either 0,1,9 (or 2? but freeway2 is y=2, which is a freeway? Actually, freeways are y=1..8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, and also note that freeway1 and 2 are not the same as freeways 3-8? We need to check freeway1 and 2 at those turns.\n\nBut freeway1 and 2 have different cars.\n\nWe must check:\n\n  Freeway1: at turn8 and turn9?\n      Car1: (-42,-53,right,6): at T: [-53+6*(T-4), -42+6*(T-4)]\n          T=8: [-53+24=-29, -42+24=-18] -> doesn't cover 0.\n          T=9: [-53+30=-23, -42+30=-12] -> safe.\n      Car2: (36,25,right,6): at T: [25+6*(T-4), 36+6*(T-4)]\n          T=8: [25+24=49, 36+24=60] -> safe.\n          T=9: [25+30=55, 36+30=66] -> safe.\n      Car3: (0,-11,right,6): at T: [-11+6*(T-4), 0+6*(T-4)]\n          T=8: [-11+24=13, 0+24=24] -> safe? 0 not in [13,24] -> safe.\n          T=9: [-11+30=19, 0+30=30] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1 is safe at T=8,9.\n\n  Freeway2: at turn8 and turn9?\n      Car: (-48,-83,right,36): at T: [-83+36*(T-4), -48+36*(T-4)]\n          T=8: [-83+36*4 = -83+144=61, -48+144=96] -> safe.\n          T=9: [-83+36*5=-83+180=97, -48+180=132] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway2 is safe at T=8,9.\n\nTherefore, at turn8 and turn9, we can be at y=0,1,2,9, or even freeway1 and freeway2 (y=1 and 2) are safe.\n\nBut note: we are at y=2 at turn4. We need to get to y=9. We have to avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turns 8 and 9.\n\nSo plan:\n\n  We can go up to y=2 at turn4 -> then we can go to y=3 at turn5, y=4 at turn6, y=5 at turn7. Then at turn7 we are at y=5 (freeway5). But freeway5 is dangerous at turn8? Actually, at turn8 we are not at freeway5 if we move. But note:\n\n  At turn7: we are at y=5 (freeway5) -> we must check freeway5 at turn7? \n      freeway5 at turn7: \n          car1: [-35+6*(7-4)= -35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe.\n          car2: [13+18=31, 24+18=42] -> safe.\n      so safe.\n\n  Then at turn7 we take an action. We cannot go to y=6 at turn8 because freeway6 at turn8 is dangerous. So we have two choices at turn7: \n      Option A: Stay at y=5 for turn8? But then at turn8 we are at freeway5 -> which is dangerous (because freeway5 at turn8: car1 is at [-11,0] -> collision). \n      Option B: Move down to y=4 at turn8? Then at turn8 we are at freeway4 -> dangerous (same reason: freeway4 at turn8: car1 is at [-11,0] -> collision). \n      Option C: Move up to y=6 at turn8? -> dangerous at freeway6.\n\nSo we cannot stay or move up/down from y=5 at turn7 without being on a dangerous freeway at turn8.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway5 at turn7? Or more generally, we must not be on freeway3-8 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nSo we must be at a safe freeway (y=0,1,2) at turn8 and turn9.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at turn7. How can we get to y=1 or 2 by turn8? We can move down: from y=5 to y=4 at turn8? But then we are at freeway4 at turn8 -> dangerous. Or we can move down 4 steps? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nFrom y=5 at turn7, we can only get to y=4,5,6 at turn8.\n\nBut none of these are safe at turn8.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at freeway5 at turn7? \n\nWe need to arrange our path so that at turn7 we are not at a freeway that forces us to be in danger at turn8.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at a safe freeway (y=0,1,2) at turn7? Then we can avoid the danger.\n\nSo let's try to be at y=2 (freeway2) at turn7? Then we are safe at turn7 (freeway2 is safe at any turn? we saw at turn8 it is safe, but what about turn7?).\n\nCheck freeway2 at turn7:\n  Car: [-83+36*(7-4)= -83+108=25, -48+108=60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen at turn7 we are at y=2. Then at turn7 we can choose to stay at y=2 for turn8? Then at turn8 we are at freeway2 -> safe (as above). Then at turn8 we can start going up again.\n\nBut how do we get to y=2 at turn7? We start at y=2 at turn4. We went up to y=5 at turn7? That would be: \n  turn4: y=2 -> then we go up for three turns: \n      turn4: U -> turn5: y=3\n      turn5: U -> turn6: y=4\n      turn6: U -> turn7: y=5\n\nBut we want to be at y=2 at turn7. So we need to go down from turn4 to turn7? But that would be: \n  turn4: start at 2 -> \n  turn4: D -> turn5: y=1\n  turn5: D -> turn6: y=0\n  turn6: U -> turn7: y=1? \n  Then we are at y=1 at turn7 -> freeway1? which is safe? \n      freeway1 at turn7: \n          car1: [-53+6*3=-53+18=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe.\n          car2: [25+18=43,36+18=54] -> safe.\n          car3: [-11+18=7,0+18=18] -> safe.\n      so safe.\n\nThen at turn7 we are at y=1. Then at turn7 we can choose to stay at y=1 for turn8? Then at turn8 we are at freeway1 -> safe (as above). Then at turn8 we can go up.\n\nBut we are at y=1 at turn7 and we need to get to y=9. That will take 8 more steps? So total turns would be more.\n\nWe want minimal H. So we try to minimize the extra turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=2 at turn4, then stay at y=2 for one or more turns until we can go up safely.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeways 3-8 at turns8 and9.\n\nSo we can stay at y=2 (freeway2) for turns4,5,6,7,8,9? Then at turn10 we start going up. But that would be 6 turns of staying? Then from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves, so total actions: 6 (stay) + 7 (up) = 13? Then H=13.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nWe can go up to y=1? But we start at y=2. Going to y=1 at turn5: then we are at freeway1 at turn5? safe? \n  freeway1 at turn5: \n      car1: [-53+6= -47, -42+6=-36] -> safe.\n      car2: [25+6=31,36+6=42] -> safe.\n      car3: [-11+6=-5,0+6=6] -> this covers 0? because 0 is in [-5,6]? -> yes, so collision.\n\nOh! So at turn5, if we are at freeway1, we collide with the third car? \n\nThe third car on freeway1: (0,-11,right,6) -> at turn5: \n  span = [-11+6*(5-4)= -11+6=-5, 0+6=6] -> so [-5,6] which includes 0 -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway1 at turn5.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid freeway1 at turns when the third car covers 0.\n\nWhen does the third car cover 0? \n  It covers 0 for T such that: -11+6*(T-4) <= 0 <= 6*(T-4)\n  => \n      Lower bound: -11+6*(T-4) <=0 -> 6*(T-4)<=11 -> T-4<=11/6≈1.83 -> T<=5.83 -> T<=5\n      Upper bound: 0<=6*(T-4) -> T>=4.\n\nSo at T=4,5: the car covers 0.\n\nAt T=4: the car is at [-11,0] -> so if we are at freeway1 at turn4, we collide? But we are not at freeway1 at turn4.\n\nAt T=5: [-5,6] -> covers 0 -> so we cannot be at freeway1 at turn5.\n\nAt T=6: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 is safe at turn6 and later.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 is safe at all turns? We saw at turn4,5,7,8,9 it is safe. Let me check turn5 and turn6 for freeway2.\n\nFreeway2: one car (-48,-83,right,36)\n  T=5: [-83+36= -47, -48+36=-12] -> safe? 0 not in.\n  T=6: [-83+72= -11, -48+72=24] -> now, 0 is in [-11,24]? -> yes, because -11<=0<=24.\n\nSo at turn6, freeway2 is dangerous? \n\n  At turn6: the car on freeway2 is at [ -83+36*(6-4)= -83+72=-11, -48+72=24] -> 0 is in [-11,24] -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway2 at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, at turn7: we already did: [25,60] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway2: dangerous at turn6? and safe at turn4,5,7,8,9.\n\nAnd freeway1: dangerous at turn4,5? safe at turn6 and later.\n\nNow, we are at turn4 at y=2 (freeway2) -> safe.\n\nWe must avoid freeway2 at turn6? and freeway1 at turn5.\n\nAnd we must avoid freeways 3-8 at turns8 and9.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nLet me try to find a path:\n\n  Turn4: at y=2 (safe). We can choose: U, D, or S.\n\n  Option: Stay at y=2 for turn5? \n      At turn5: y=2 -> freeway2: \n          car: [-83+36*(5-4)= -83+36=-47, -48+36=-12] -> safe.\n\n      Then turn5: we can choose again.\n\n  But we want to eventually go up.\n\n  Alternatively, we can go up at turn4 to y=3 at turn5.\n\n      At turn5: y=3 -> freeway3: \n          car1: [-35+6*(5-4)= -29, -24+6=-18] -> safe.\n          car2: [13+6=19,24+6=30] -> safe.\n\n      Then turn5: we can go up to y=4 at turn6? \n          At turn6: y=4 -> freeway4: \n              car1: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n              car2: [13+12=25,24+12=36] -> safe.\n\n      Then turn6: go up to y=5 at turn7? \n          At turn7: y=5 -> freeway5: \n              car1: [-35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe.\n              car2: [13+18=31,24+18=42] -> safe.\n\n      Then turn7: we are at y=5. Now, we cannot go to y=6 at turn8 (danger) and cannot stay (danger) and cannot go down to y=4 (danger at freeway4 at turn8). \n\n      So we must go to a safe freeway at turn8: which are y=0,1,2,9? But we are at y=5. We can only go to y=4,5,6 at turn8 -> all dangerous.\n\n  So this path gets stuck.\n\n  Alternatively, after turn5 at y=3, we could stay at turn5? Then at turn6 we are at y=3 (freeway3) -> \n      freeway3 at turn6: \n          car1: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n          car2: [13+12=25,24+12=36] -> safe.\n\n      Then turn6: we can go up to y=4 at turn7? \n          freeway4 at turn7: \n              car1: [-35+18=-17,-6] -> safe.\n              car2: [13+18=31,24+18=42] -> safe.\n\n      Then turn7: we are at y=4. Then turn7: we can only go to y=3,4,5 at turn8 -> dangerous for freeways3,4,5.\n\n  Still stuck.\n\n  Or after turn5 at y=3, we go down to y=2 at turn6? \n      At turn6: y=2 -> freeway2: which is dangerous at turn6 (car: [-11,24] includes 0) -> collision.\n\n  So that is not safe.\n\n  Or we could go down at turn4 to y=1? But then at turn5: y=1 -> freeway1: which is dangerous at turn5 (car3: [-5,6] includes 0) -> collision.\n\n  So we cannot go down at turn4.\n\n  Or stay at turn4: y=2 -> safe. Then at turn5, we are still at y=2 -> safe (as above).\n\n  Then at turn5: we can go up to y=3 at turn6? \n      At turn6: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as above at turn6: [-23,-12] and [25,36] -> safe).\n\n  Then turn6: we can go up to y=4 at turn7? \n      At turn7: y=4 -> freeway4: \n          car1: [-35+18=-17,-6] -> safe.\n          car2: [13+18=31,24+18=42] -> safe.\n\n  Then turn7: we are at y=4. Then we need to avoid freeways3-8 at turn8 and9.\n\n  So at turn7, we can go down? to y=3 at turn8? -> freeway3 at turn8: dangerous (car1: [-11,0] -> collision).\n  Or stay at y=4 at turn8: freeway4 at turn8: dangerous.\n  Or go up to y=5 at turn8: freeway5: dangerous.\n\n  So again stuck.\n\nWe need to be at a safe freeway (y=0,1,2) at turn8 and turn9.\n\nSo let's try to be at y=2 at turn8.\n\nHow to get from y=2 at turn4 to y=2 at turn8? We can do:\n\n  turn4: S (stay) -> turn5: y=2\n  turn5: S -> turn6: y=2 -> but freeway2 at turn6 is dangerous! -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at y=1 at turn5.\n\nBut we can be at y=1 at turn6? \n  freeway1 at turn6: \n      car1: [-53+12=-41, -42+12=-30] -> safe.\n      car2: [25+12=37,36+12=48] -> safe.\n      car3: [-11+12=1,0+12=12] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1 at turn6 is safe.\n\nAnd at turn7: freeway1 is safe (as above).\n\nSo plan to be at y=1 at turn6 and turn7? Then at turn8 we can be at y=1 or move to y=2.\n\nBut how to get to y=1 at turn6? \n\n  We start at y=2 at turn4.\n  turn4: D -> turn5: y=1 -> but freeway1 at turn5 is dangerous (car3 covers 0) -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=1 at turn5.\n\n turn4: S -> turn5: y=2 (safe).\n turn5: D -> turn6: y=1 (freeway1) -> and freeway1 at turn6 is safe.\n\nThen turn6: we can stay at y=1 or move to y=0 or y=2.\n\nBut we need to be safe at turn7,8,9.\n\n turn6: at y=1 (safe). \n  turn6: S -> turn7: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe.\n  turn7: S -> turn8: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe.\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=2 -> freeway2: at turn9, we already know safe? \n      freeway2 at turn9: car: [-83+36*5=97, -48+180=132] -> safe.\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y=3 -> freeway3: at turn10, we must check.\n\n freeway3 at turn10: \n     car1: [-35+6*(10-4)= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> safe? 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n     car2: [13+36=49,24+36=60] -> safe.\n\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn11: \n      car1: [-35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+42=55,24+42=66] -> safe.\n\n  turn11: U -> turn12: y=5 -> freeway5: \n      car1: [-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+48=61,24+48=72] -> safe.\n\n  turn12: U -> turn13: y=6 -> freeway6: \n      car1: [-35+54=19, -24+54=30] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+54=67,24+54=78] -> safe.\n\n  turn13: U -> turn14: y=7 -> freeway7: \n      car1: [-35+60=25, -24+60=36] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+60=73,24+60=84] -> safe.\n\n  turn14: U -> turn15: y=8 -> freeway8: \n      car1: [-35+66=31, -24+66=42] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+66=79,24+66=90] -> safe.\n\n  turn15: U -> turn16: y=9 -> done.\n\nSo total actions from turn4 to turn15: 12 actions? H=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe could try to be at y=0 at some turns to reduce steps? But moving down to 0 and then up might take more steps.\n\nAlternatively, after turn7 we are at y=1. Instead of waiting until turn8 to go to y=2, we can go up earlier? But we have to avoid freeways 3-8 at turns8 and9.\n\nAt turn7: we are at y=1.\n  We could go up at turn7: to y=2 at turn8 -> safe (freeway2 at turn8: safe).\n  Then at turn8: we are at y=2.\n  Then at turn8: we can go up to y=3 at turn9 -> freeway3 at turn9: \n        car1: [-35+6*5=-35+30=-5, -24+30=6] -> covers 0 -> collision.\n\n  So cannot go to freeway3 at turn9.\n\n  Or at turn8: stay at y=2 for turn9? -> safe (freeway2 at turn9: safe).\n  Then turn9: go up to y=3 at turn10 -> freeway3 at turn10: safe (car1: [1,12] -> safe).\n\n  Then the rest as before.\n\n  So:\n      turn4: S (y=2)\n      turn5: D (y=1)   [at turn6: y=1]\n      turn6: S (y=1)\n      turn7: U (y=2)   [at turn8: y=2]\n      turn8: S (y=2)   [at turn9: y=2]\n      turn9: U (y=3)   [at turn10: y=3]\n      then U every turn until y=9.\n\n  How many actions? \n      From turn4 to turn9: we have 6 actions: S, D, S, U, S, U -> then from y=3 at turn10 to y=9: 6 actions (U each). \n      So total actions: 6 + 6 = 12 actions? But wait, at turn10: y=3, then \n        turn10: U -> turn11: y=4\n        turn11: U -> turn12: y=5\n        turn12: U -> turn13: y=6\n        turn13: U -> turn14: y=7\n        turn14: U -> turn15: y=8\n        turn15: U -> turn16: y=9\n\n      So actions from turn4 to turn15: 12 actions, and we reach y=9 at turn16.\n\n  H=12.\n\nBut can we do better? We want minimal H.\n\nWe could try to be at y=0 at turn8 and turn9? \n\n  To be at y=0 at turn8: \n      turn4: start at y=2.\n      turn4: D -> turn5: y=1 -> collision (freeway1 at turn5).\n      cannot.\n\n  Or turn4: S, turn5: D -> turn6: y=1 (safe), then turn6: D -> turn7: y=0 (safe, not a freeway), then turn7: S -> turn8: y=0, turn8: S -> turn9: y=0. Then turn9: U -> turn10: y=1 (freeway1 at turn10: safe), then U every turn.\n\n  How many actions? \n      Actions: \n        turn4: S\n        turn5: D -> turn6: y=1\n        turn6: D -> turn7: y=0\n        turn7: S -> turn8: y=0\n        turn8: S -> turn9: y=0\n        turn9: U -> turn10: y=1\n        turn10: U -> turn11: y=2\n        turn11: U -> turn12: y=3\n        ... until turn16: y=7 -> then turn16: U -> turn17: y=8, turn17: U -> turn18: y=9.\n\n  That's 14 actions? Worse than 12.\n\nAlternatively, after turn7 at y=0, we can start going up earlier? \n\n  turn7: y=0, then turn7: U -> turn8: y=1 (freeway1 at turn8: safe), then turn8: U -> turn9: y=2 (freeway2 at turn9: safe), then turn9: U -> turn10: y=3 (freeway3 at turn10: safe), then continue.\n\n  Actions:\n      turn4: S\n      turn5: D -> turn6: y=1\n      turn6: D -> turn7: y=0\n      turn7: U -> turn8: y=1\n      turn8: U -> turn9: y=2\n      turn9: U -> turn10: y=3\n      then 6 U's to get to y=9 at turn16.\n\n  Count: 7 actions from turn4 to turn10: then from y=3 at turn10 to y=9 at turn16: 6 actions -> total 13 actions? \n      Specifically: \n          turn4: S (action1)\n          turn5: D (2)\n          turn6: D (3)\n          turn7: U (4)\n          turn8: U (5)\n          turn9: U (6)\n          turn10: U (7) -> y=4 at turn11\n          turn11: U (8) -> y=5\n          turn12: U (9) -> y=6\n          turn13: U (10) -> y=7\n          turn14: U (11) -> y=8\n          turn15: U (12) -> y=9\n\n      So 12 actions? Then we reach at turn16. H=12.\n\n  Same as before.\n\nBut earlier with the path that stayed at y=1 for turns6 and7, then moved to y=2 for turns8 and9, then up: also 12 actions.\n\nIs there a way with 11 actions? \n\n  We start at y=2 at turn4. We need to be at y=9 at turn4+11 = turn15.\n\n  We must avoid freeways 3-8 at turns8 and9.\n\n  So at turns8 and9, we must be at y in {0,1,2,9}. But y=9 is our goal, so if we can be at y=9 by turn8 or turn9, that would be good.\n\n  To be at y=9 by turn8: from y=2 at turn4 to y=9 at turn8: that requires 7 steps in 4 actions? Impossible.\n\n  To be at y=9 by turn9: 7 steps in 5 actions: also impossible.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=9 before turn11 at the earliest (if we go up continuously from turn4: 7 steps -> turn11). But then we are in the danger zone at turn8 and9 on freeways.\n\n  Therefore, we must be at y=0,1, or 2 at turns8 and9.\n\n  How to minimize the number of actions? We want to spend as few extra actions as possible.\n\n  The direct up takes 7 actions but fails because of turns8 and9.\n\n  We have to add at least 5 extra actions? \n\n      We need to go up 7 steps, but we also need to spend 2 turns (8 and9) in the safe zone. \n\n  But note: we can use the safe zone turns for going up? \n\n  For example, at turn8 and9 we can be at y=1 or 2 and then from there go up.\n\n  The minimal distance is 7, but we have to account for the detour.\n\n  We are at y=2 at turn4.\n\n  We can go up as far as we can before turn8, but then at turn8 and9 we must be at y<=2.\n\n  So the highest we can be before turn8 is y=2 (at turn7) if we want to be at y<=2 at turn8. \n\n  Because from turn4 to turn7: 3 actions. We can go up 3 steps: to y=5 at turn7. But then we have to come back down to y=2 by turn8? Impossible in one action.\n\n  Alternatively, we might not go that high.\n\n  Let me try to maximize the y at turn7 without causing danger later.\n\n  We know we cannot be on freeways 3-8 at turn8 and9, so at turn7 we must choose an action that lands us at a safe freeway at turn8.\n\n  The safe freeways at turn8 are y=0,1,2.\n\n  From any y at turn7, we can move to y-1, y, y+1 at turn8.\n\n  So to be at y<=2 at turn8, we must be at y in {1,2,3} at turn7.\n\n  Similarly, to be at y<=2 at turn9, we must be at y in {1,2,3} at turn8.\n\n  But we are at y=2 at turn4.\n\n  We have turns 4,5,6,7 to move.\n\n  We can go up to at most y=2+3=5 at turn7? but then we have to get down to at most y=3 at turn7? \n\n  Actually, to be at y<=3 at turn7, we can only go up at most 1 net from turn4 to turn7? \n\n  turn4: y=2.\n  turn4: U -> turn5: y=3\n  turn5: U -> turn6: y=4\n  turn6: D -> turn7: y=3\n\n  This is possible.\n\n  Then at turn7: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn7: \n        car1: [-35+6*3=-35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+18=31,24+18=42] -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn7: we can go down to y=2 at turn8? \n        freeway2 at turn8: safe.\n\n  Then at turn8: y=2 -> we can go down to y=1 at turn9? \n        freeway1 at turn9: safe (car3: [19,30] -> safe).\n  Then at turn9: y=1 -> then we can start going up.\n\n  Actions:\n      turn4: U -> turn5: y=3\n      turn5: U -> turn6: y=4\n      turn6: D -> turn7: y=3\n      turn7: D -> turn8: y=2\n      turn8: D -> turn9: y=1\n      turn9: U -> turn10: y=2\n      turn10: U -> turn11: y=3\n      turn11: U -> turn12: y=4\n      ... until turn16: y=9.\n\n  That's 12 actions again.\n\n  But note: at turn10: y=2, then we go up: \n        turn9: U -> turn10: y=2? \n        turn10: U -> turn11: y=3\n        turn11: U -> turn12: y=4\n        turn12: U -> turn13: y=5\n        turn13: U -> turn14: y=6\n        turn14: U -> turn15: y=7\n        turn15: U -> turn16: y=8\n        turn16: U -> turn17: y=9\n\n  That's 13 actions? \n\n  Let me list the actions and resulting y at the next turn:\n\n      turn4: U -> y5=3\n      turn5: U -> y6=4\n      turn6: D -> y7=3\n      turn7: D -> y8=2\n      turn8: D -> y9=1\n      turn9: U -> y10=2\n      turn10: U -> y11=3\n      turn11: U -> y12=4\n      turn12: U -> y13=5\n      turn13: U -> y14=6\n      turn14: U -> y15=7\n      turn15: U -> y16=8\n      turn16: U -> y17=9\n\n  So we need actions up to turn16: 13 actions? H=13.\n\n  But wait, we are at turn4 and do 13 actions: from a4 to a16? That's 13 actions.\n\n  We can try to from turn9: we are at y=1, then we go up twice to y=3 at turn11, then continue.\n\n  But still, from y=1 to y=9: 8 steps -> 8 actions.\n\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y=2\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y=3\n  then 6 more to y=9 at turn17: total actions from turn4 to turn16: 13 actions.\n\n  But the first plan (with staying at y=1 for two turns) was 12 actions.\n\n  Let me recount the first plan:\n\n      turn4: S  (y5=2)\n      turn5: D  (y6=1)\n      turn6: S  (y7=1)\n      turn7: U  (y8=2)\n      turn8: S  (y9=2)\n      turn9: U  (y10=3)\n      turn10: U (y11=4)\n      turn11: U (y12=5)\n      turn12: U (y13=6)\n      turn13: U (y14=7)\n      turn14: U (y15=8)\n      turn15: U (y16=9)\n\n  Actions: turn4 to turn15: that's 12 actions (t=4,5,...,15 -> 12 actions). And we are at y=9 at turn16.\n\n  So H=12.\n\n  Is there an 11-action solution? \n\n  We need to reach y=9 by turn4+11 = turn15.\n\n  So we must gain 7 in net in 11 actions. That means we can have 11-7=4 down or stay actions.\n\n  But we also have to be at a safe freeway at turn8 and9.\n\n  Suppose we try to be at y=2 at turn8 and turn9.\n\n  How to be at y=2 at turn8 and turn9, and still get to y=9 by turn15.\n\n  The net up from turn4 to turn15 is 7.\n\n  From turn4 (y=2) to turn8 (y=2): net 0 in 4 actions -> so 4 actions that net 0: could be 2 up and 2 down, or stays.\n\n  From turn8 to turn15: 7 actions to gain 7 -> must be all up.\n\n  So at turn8: y=2, then turn8 to turn15: 7 ups: \n        turn8: U -> turn9: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn9: dangerous! -> because at turn9, freeway3 has car1: [-5,6] covering 0.\n\n  So we cannot be at freeway3 at turn9.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot have an up at turn8 that puts us at freeway3 at turn9.\n\n  If we are at y=2 at turn9, then at turn9: U -> turn10: y=3 -> safe (freeway3 at turn10: safe).\n\n  So we must be at y=2 at turn9.\n\n  Then from turn9 to turn15: 6 actions to go from y=2 to y=9: that requires 7 steps? -> impossible.\n\n  Alternatively, we could be at y=1 at turn8 and turn9.\n\n  Then from turn8: y=1, turn8: U -> turn9: y=2 (safe), then turn9: U -> turn10: y=3 (safe), then we have 5 actions left to get to y=9: from y=3 to y=9: 6 steps -> need 6 actions, but we only have 5 (from turn10 to turn14) -> cannot.\n\n  Or if we are at y=0 at turn8 and turn9: \n        turn8: y=0, then turn8: U -> turn9: y=1 (safe), turn9: U -> turn10: y=2, then 5 actions to get to y=9: from y=2 to y=9: 7 steps -> cannot.\n\n  So it seems 12 is the minimal.\n\nTherefore, we choose the 12-action plan that we described:\n\n  turn4: S\n  turn5: D\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n\nThis means:\n\n  At turn4: we stay at y=2.\n  At turn5: we move down to y=1.\n  At turn6: we stay at y=1.\n  At turn7: we move up to y=2.\n  At turn8: we stay at y=2.\n  At turn9: we move up to y=3.\n  Then we move up every turn until we reach y=9.\n\nNow, we must verify that there is no collision at any turn.\n\n  Turn4: y=2 -> freeway2: \n        car: [-83+36*(4-4)= -83,-48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  Turn5: y=2 (because we stayed at turn4) -> freeway2: \n        car: [-83+36=-47, -48+36=-12] -> safe.\n\n  Turn5 action: D -> so at turn6, we will be at y=1.\n  Turn6: y=1 -> freeway1: \n        car1: [-53+6*(6-4)= -53+12=-41, -42+12=-30] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+12=37,36+12=48] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+12=1,0+12=12] -> safe.\n\n  Turn6 action: S -> so at turn7: y=1.\n  Turn7: y=1 -> freeway1: \n        car1: [-53+18=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+18=43,36+18=54] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+18=7,0+18=18] -> safe.\n\n  Turn7 action: U -> so at turn8: y=2.\n  Turn8: y=2 -> freeway2: \n        car: [-83+36*(8-4)= -83+144=61, -48+144=96] -> safe.\n\n  Turn8 action: S -> so at turn9: y=2.\n  Turn9: y=2 -> freeway2: \n        car: [-83+36*5= -83+180=97, -48+180=132] -> safe.\n\n  Turn9 action: U -> so at turn10: y=3.\n  Turn10: y=3 -> freeway3: \n        car1: [-35+6*(10-4)= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        car2: [13+36=49,24+36=60] -> safe.\n\n  Turn10: U -> turn11: y=4 -> freeway4: \n        car1: [-35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+42=55,24+42=66] -> safe.\n\n  Turn11: U -> turn12: y=5 -> freeway5: \n        car1: [-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+48=61,24+48=72] -> safe.\n\n  Turn12: U -> turn13: y=6 -> freeway6: \n        car1: [-35+54=19, -24+54=30] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+54=67,24+54=78] -> safe.\n\n  Turn13: U -> turn14: y=7 -> freeway7: \n        car1: [-35+60=25, -24+60=36] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+60=73,24+60=84] -> safe.\n\n  Turn14: U -> turn15: y=8 -> freeway8: \n        car1: [-35+66=31, -24+66=42] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+66=79,24+66=90] -> safe.\n\n  Turn15: U -> turn16: y=9 -> done.\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions for 12 turns (H=12) is:\n\n  Turn 4: S\n  Turn 5: D\n  Turn 6: S\n  Turn 7: U\n  Turn 8: S\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n\nBut note: the actions are for turns starting at t1=4, and we have 12 actions: from turn4 to turn15.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nThis is the minimal H we found (12).\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\n Important note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n Also note: When moving from freeway y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is only on freeway y at turn T. At the next turn, they are on the new freeway. So at the moment of the move (turn T), we only check the car on the current freeway (the one we are leaving) and not the one we are entering until the next turn.\n\n The goal is to go from y=2 to y=9. Since we start at y=2 and we can only move up or down by 1 per turn (or stay), we must go up at least 7 times. However, we might have to wait (stay) to avoid collisions.\n\n We are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions at each step.\n\n The car state is given for each freeway (1 to 8). Note that the cars are moving either left or right at constant speed.\n\n How the car moves:\n   Left-moving: span at time t1 is [h, tau] (and note that h <= tau? Actually, the representation seems to be: for left-moving, the head is at the leftmost? But the update rule for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n   Right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\n However, note the representation in the table:\n   For freeway 1: \n        (-36, -47, right, 6) -> but wait, if it's right-moving, then the head is the rightmost? Actually, the representation says: for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail to head? And then it moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both.\n\n But note: the car at freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 6). Since it's right-moving, the tail is at -47 and the head at -36? Then the span is [-47, -36] at t1=5? But wait, the representation says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> so tail=-47, head=-36. Then at time T, the tail becomes -47 + 6*(T-5) and the head becomes -36 + 6*(T-5).\n\n However, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\". So the entire car moves to the right.\n\n Similarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, tau] and then subtract s*(T-t1).\n\n But note the example in freeway 1: there is also (42,31,right,6). Wait, 42 and 31? Then if tail=31 and head=42? But that would be [31,42] at t1=5? Then at time T: [31+6*(T-5), 42+6*(T-5)].\n\n However, the problem states: for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning the tail is the leftmost? Actually, no: in a right-moving car, the head is the front, which is to the right. So the tail is the left end and the head is the right end. So the span is [tail, head] = [leftmost, rightmost]. So in the car (-36, -47, right, 6): \n   Here, the head is -36 and the tail is -47? That would imply the tail is at -47 (left) and the head at -36 (right). But then the span is from -47 to -36. However, the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, ...) but the rule uses (tail, head) for the span? Actually, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\".\n\n This is confusing. Let me read again: \n   \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\n Then for right-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [tau, h]   -> so the tail is the left end and the head is the right end.\n\n But the car is given as (h, tau) meaning head and tail? Then for the first car on freeway1: \n      head = -36, tail = -47 -> so the car spans from -47 (tail) to -36 (head). \n\n Similarly, the second car: head=42, tail=31 -> so the car spans from 31 to 42.\n\n And the third car: head=6, tail=-5 -> so the car spans from -5 to 6.\n\n Now, at time T, for a right-moving car: \n      left end (tail) = tau + s*(T-t1)\n      right end (head) = h + s*(T-t1)\n\n For left-moving, the representation would be: (head, tail) and then the update: \n      left end (head) = h - s*(T-t1)   [because head is the front which is the leftmost?]\n      right end (tail) = tau - s*(T-t1) \n\n But note: the problem says for left-moving: \n        Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\n However, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at h (which is the leftmost?) and the tail at tau (which is the rightmost). Then the entire car moves left by s*(T-t1). So the head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1). \n\n But in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check: \n   Freeway 1: three cars, all right.\n   Freeway 2: one car, right.\n   Freeways 3 to 8: two cars each, all right.\n\n So we don't have any left-moving cars. So we only need to handle right-moving cars.\n\n Therefore, for a car (h, tau, right, s) at time T (>= t1=5), the car's span is:\n      [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)]\n\n We must avoid being at (0, k) at turn T when k is the freeway and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at that turn.\n\n Also note: the player starts at (0,2) at turn 5. We are at freeway 2 at turn 5.\n\n How do we plan?\n We need to go from y=2 to y=9. The minimal number of turns is 7 (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\n Steps:\n   We simulate for each turn starting from turn 5, and we try to choose an action (U, D, S) that does not cause a collision and minimizes the total turns.\n\n However, note that we can also move down? But we are at y=2 and we want to go to y=9. Moving down would take us away. So we should avoid moving down unless necessary to avoid a collision? But then we have to come back up, which would take more turns. So we should try to go up as much as possible, but sometimes we might have to stay or even move down to let a car pass.\n\n But note: we start at freeway 2. We must check freeway 2 at turn 5: are we colliding at turn 5? \n   At turn 5, the player is at (0,2). So we check freeway 2: \n        There is one car: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n        Its span at T=5: \n            tail = -47 + 36*(5-5) = -47\n            head = -12 + 36*(0) = -12\n        So the car spans from -47 to -12. 0 is not in [-47, -12] -> safe.\n\n So we are safe at turn 5.\n\n Now, we plan for the next turns.\n\n We'll consider that we want to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible. However, we must check the freeways we are going to step on.\n\n Let's denote:\n   t = 5: y=2 -> safe.\n\n   Then at turn 5 we choose an action that will lead us to turn 6.\n\n   We have three choices: U -> then at turn 6 we will be at y=3.\n                D -> then at turn 6 we will be at y=1.\n                S -> then at turn 6 we remain at y=2.\n\n   We must avoid collisions at the moment of being on a freeway at a given turn.\n\n   So at turn 6, if we are at y=2 (by choosing S at turn5) then we check freeway2 at turn6.\n\n   Similarly, if we choose U at turn5, then at turn6 we are at y=3 -> so we check freeway3 at turn6.\n\n   And if we choose D at turn5, then at turn6 we are at y=1 -> check freeway1 at turn6.\n\n   Also note: when we are at turn5 and we choose an action, we are still at freeway2 for the entire turn5. Then at turn6 we are at the new freeway.\n\n   Therefore, the collision at turn5 has already been checked (we are safe). Now we are planning for turn6 and beyond.\n\n   We must also note: if we choose to stay at turn5, then at turn5 we are at freeway2 and we have already checked that it's safe. Then at turn6 we are still at freeway2? Only if we choose S again? Actually, if we choose S at turn5, then at turn6 we are at freeway2? No: \n        The action at turn5: if we choose S, then y6 = y5 = 2 -> so at turn6 we are at freeway2.\n\n   Similarly, if we choose U at turn5, then y6 = 3 -> at turn6 we are at freeway3.\n\n   So we must check the freeway we are at for each turn.\n\n   We are going to simulate turn by turn until we reach y=9.\n\n   Since we want the minimal H, we try to go up as much as possible, but if going up leads to a collision, we try staying or even moving down (but that would be expensive, so we try to avoid if possible).\n\n   We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) to find the minimal steps. The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=5) and y in [0,9]. We want to reach (t,9) for any t.\n\n   However, note that the car positions change with time, so the collision condition depends on t.\n\n   We start at (5,2). Then we consider t=6 with y=1,2,3.\n\n   We must check for each state (t,y) whether being at freeway y at turn t is safe.\n\n   Steps for a state (t,y):\n        If y is 0 or 9: \n            - Note: the freeways are from 1 to 8. The player can be at y=0 or y=9 without being on a freeway? \n            - The problem says: the grid has vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. And collision only occurs on freeways y=1,...,8. So being at y=0 or y=9 is always safe? \n            - However, we start at (0,2) and we are at freeway2. The goal is (0,9) which is not a freeway? \n            - But note: the goal is to reach (0,9). At (0,9) we are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1..8). So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, we only check collisions when we are at freeway y (1<=y<=8) at turn t.\n\n   So for state (t,y) with y in [1,8], we must check all cars on freeway y at turn t.\n\n   How to check for a car (h, tau, right, s) at freeway y at turn t?\n        The car's span at time t: [tau + s*(t-5), h + s*(t-5)]\n        We check if 0 is in the interval [tau+s*(t-5), h+s*(t-5)] (note: inclusive? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume inclusive).\n\n   If at least one car on freeway y has 0 in its span at turn t, then state (t,y) is a collision -> invalid.\n\n   If y=0 or y=9, then no collision.\n\n   We are going to do a BFS (by time steps) because we want the minimal H (number of turns). The number of turns H is the number of actions we take. We start at turn5 and take H actions to get to turn5+H.\n\n   We want the sequence of actions.\n\n   Since the grid is small (y in 0..9) and the time might be bounded (we don't want to go too far in time because the cars move and eventually might leave the area), we can simulate until we find a path.\n\n   We note that the cars move at high speeds, so the positions change quickly.\n\n   We'll use a queue: each element is (t, y, path) where t is the current turn (starting at 5) and y the current position, and path is the sequence of actions taken so far (from turn5 to the current state).\n\n   We start: (5, 2, [])\n\n   Then we generate next states for t+1 (i.e., next turn) by trying U, D, S.\n\n   Constraints: \n        If we choose U: then next_y = min(9, y+1)\n        D: next_y = max(0, y-1)\n        S: next_y = y\n\n   Then we check the state (t+1, next_y) for collision? Actually, note: at the next turn (t+1), we are at next_y. But we must also note: during the turn t (the current turn) we are at the current freeway (if y in [1,8]) and we have already been checked when we entered that state? \n\n   Actually, when we are at state (t, y), that means we are at turn t and position y and we have already checked that (t,y) is safe. Now we are going to take an action at turn t, and then at turn t+1 we will be at next_y.\n\n   So we only need to check the next state (t+1, next_y) for collision? \n\n   However, note: during the entire turn t we are at y. We have already checked that (t,y) is safe when we entered that state. The action we take at turn t does not change our position during turn t, it only changes our position for turn t+1.\n\n   Therefore, the next state (t+1, next_y) must be checked for collision at turn t+1.\n\n   Steps in the BFS:\n\n      Let Q be a queue. We start with (5, 2, []).\n\n      Mark visited states: (t, y) to avoid cycles? But note: we might need to revisit the same y at a later turn because the cars move and the situation changes. So we don't mark states as visited? Or we do, but note that the same (y) at a later turn is a different state. So we can use (t,y) as state.\n\n      However, t can increase without bound. But we are looking for the minimal H. We can set a limit? Since the minimal steps without obstacles is 7, we can try to go up to, say, 20 turns? But the problem doesn't specify a bound.\n\n      Alternatively, we note that the cars are moving and after some time, the cars might have moved away from 0. We can simulate until we find a path.\n\n      We'll do BFS by increasing t.\n\n      We'll keep a visited set: (t, y) but note that the same (t,y) might be reached by different paths? But if we reached (t,y) by a shorter path, we don't need to consider a longer one. So we can mark (t,y) as visited? However, note that we are counting the number of turns (which is t-5) and we want the minimal. So if we have already visited (t,y) with the same t and y, we skip. But note: we might have different paths that arrive at (t,y) and then the future actions might be different? But if we are at (t,y), the future is independent of the path. So we can mark (t,y) as visited.\n\n      Algorithm:\n\n        Let dist[t][y] = minimal steps taken (or we don't need steps, we just mark visited) but we are doing BFS by time, so the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal steps? Actually, the number of actions taken is (t - 5). And we want to minimize the total turns H = (t - 5) until we reach y=9.\n\n        We are going to expand by one turn at a time.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Initialize: \n              queue = deque([(5, 2, [])])   # [turn, y, actions_so_far]\n              visited = set() \n              visited.add((5,2))\n\n          while queue:\n              pop state (t, y, actions)\n\n              if y == 9: then we have found a solution: H = t - 5? Actually, note: we are at turn t and we have taken (t-5) actions. But we started at turn5 without having taken any action? Actually, we are at turn5 and we are about to take the first action? \n\n              Let me clarify: \n                  At turn5, we are at (0,2). Then we take an action at turn5 to determine where we are at turn6. \n                  So the first action is taken at turn5, and then we are at turn6 at the new y.\n\n                  Therefore, the number of actions H is the number of turns we simulate. We start at turn5 and we take H actions to get to turn5+H.\n\n                  We want to be at y=9 at turn5+H.\n\n              So when we are at state (t, y) and we have taken (t-5) actions, then if y==9, we output the actions.\n\n              Otherwise, we try the three actions for the current turn (turn t):\n\n                  For a in ['U','D','S']:\n                      next_y = \n                         if a=='U': min(9, y+1)\n                         if a=='D': max(0, y-1)\n                         if a=='S': y\n\n                      Then next_t = t+1\n                      Then we check the state (next_t, next_y) for collision? \n                         Only if next_y is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), then we check the cars on freeway next_y at turn next_t.\n\n                         How to check: for each car on freeway next_y (we have the list from the input), we compute the car's span at turn next_t.\n\n                         For a car (h, tau, right, s) on freeway next_y (which is right-moving only in our case), the span is:\n                             left = tau + s*(next_t - 5)\n                             right = h + s*(next_t - 5)\n\n                         If 0 is in the interval [left, right] (i.e., left <= 0 <= right), then collision -> skip.\n\n                         If next_y is 0 or 9, then no collision.\n\n                      If the state (next_t, next_y) is safe, and if we haven't visited (next_t, next_y) before, then we push (next_t, next_y, actions + [a]) and mark visited (next_t, next_y).\n\n          If we find a solution, we output the actions.\n\n          But note: we might have to wait arbitrarily long? However, the cars are moving and eventually the cars on a particular freeway might leave the 0 position. We don't set a bound? We might run forever? \n\n          We need to note that the cars are moving at integer speeds and the positions are integers. The problem does not specify bounds, but the cars that are very far might not matter. We can set a bound on t? \n\n          Alternatively, we note that the minimal H is at least 7. We can set a maximum H, say 50? \n\n          But let me look at the car speeds: \n            freeway1: one car at speed 36 -> it moves very fast. \n            freeway2: one car at speed 36 -> also fast.\n            freeways3-8: cars at speed 6.\n\n          The car on freeway2 at turn5: (-12,-47,right,36) -> at turn5: [-47, -12] -> safe.\n          At turn6: [-47+36, -12+36] = [ -11, 24 ] -> 0 is in [-11,24] -> so at turn6, freeway2 is unsafe? \n\n          But wait: we are at freeway2 at turn5 and we are safe. Then at turn6, if we stay at freeway2, then we will be at (0,2) at turn6? But then we check freeway2 at turn6: the car now spans [-11,24] which includes 0 -> so we would collide.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot stay at freeway2 at turn6.\n\n          Similarly, if we move to freeway1 at turn6: \n                freeway1 at turn6: \n                  car1: (-36,-47,right,6) -> at turn6: [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41, -30] -> 0 not in [-41,-30] -> safe? \n                  car2: (42,31,right,6) -> [31+6, 42+6] = [37,48] -> safe.\n                  car3: (6,-5,right,6) -> [-5+6, 6+6] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          So freeway1 at turn6 is safe.\n\n          If we move to freeway3 at turn6: \n                freeway3: two cars at speed 6.\n                  car1: (-18,-29,right,6) -> [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n                  car2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+6,30+6] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n          So both freeway1 and freeway3 are safe at turn6.\n\n          Therefore, at turn5 we can choose either D (to go to freeway1) or U (to go to freeway3) or S (to stay at freeway2) but we saw that staying at freeway2 at turn6 is unsafe. So we avoid S.\n\n          So we have two options: D and U.\n\n          We want the minimal H, so we try to go up first? But we have to see the entire path.\n\n          We'll do BFS and we break when we reach y=9.\n\n          We'll simulate until we find a path.\n\n          We'll set a maximum turn limit to avoid infinite loop, say 100.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We have the initial state: t=5, y=2.\n\n   We have the car data for each freeway (1 to 8). We'll store:\n\n        cars[i] = list of cars on freeway i, each car is (head, tail, direction, speed) \n        But note: all directions are 'right'. So we can ignore direction.\n\n   For a state (t, y): \n        if y in [1,8]:\n            for each car in cars[y]:\n                # car = (h, tau, d, s) -> but d is always 'right'\n                left_end = tau + s*(t-5)\n                right_end = h + s*(t-5)\n                if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                    then collision -> skip this state.\n\n        Otherwise, safe.\n\n   Then we proceed.\n\n   We'll do BFS in terms of the turn t.\n\n   We start:\n\n        t=5, y=2: safe (as we checked).\n\n        Then we try the three actions at turn5:\n\n            a='S': then next_y = 2, next_t=6 -> then we check (6,2): \n                freeway2: car (-12,-47,right,36) -> \n                    left_end = -47 + 36*(1) = -11\n                    right_end = -12 + 36 = 24\n                    0 in [-11,24] -> collision -> skip.\n\n            a='U': next_y = 3, next_t=6 -> check freeway3 at t=6:\n                cars on freeway3: \n                    car1: (-18,-29,right,6) -> [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n                    car2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+6,30+6] = [25,36] -> safe.\n                so (6,3) is safe -> push (6,3, ['U'])\n\n            a='D': next_y = 1, next_t=6 -> check freeway1 at t=6:\n                cars on freeway1: \n                    car1: (-36,-47,right,6) -> [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n                    car2: (42,31,right,6) -> [31+6,42+6] = [37,48] -> safe.\n                    car3: (6,-5,right,6) -> [-5+6,6+6] = [1,12] -> safe? 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n                so (6,1) is safe -> push (6,1, ['D'])\n\n        Now we have two states: (6,3) and (6,1)\n\n        Then we expand (6,3) and (6,1) at next.\n\n        We continue until we find a state with y=9.\n\n   We hope to find a path.\n\n   Let's try to simulate a few steps:\n\n   Option 1: (6,3) with actions ['U']:\n\n        At turn6, we are at freeway3. Then we try actions for turn6:\n\n          a='U': next_y=4, t=7 -> check freeway4 at t=7:\n                freeway4: two cars at speed6 (same as freeway3)\n                    car1: (-18,-29,right,6) -> at t=7: [-29+6*2, -18+6*2] = [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> 0 is not in? [-17,-6] -> 0 is greater than -6? Actually, -6 is the right end? Then 0 is not in [-17,-6] because -6<0 -> safe? \n                    car2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+12,30+12]=[31,42] -> safe.\n                -> safe.\n\n                Then state (7,4, ['U','U'])\n\n          a='S': next_y=3, t=7 -> check freeway3 at t=7:\n                car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                car2: [19+12,30+12]=[31,42] -> safe.\n                -> safe.\n\n          a='D': next_y=2, t=7 -> check freeway2 at t=7:\n                freeway2: only one car: (-12,-47,right,36) -> at t=7: \n                    left_end = -47 + 36*(7-5)= -47+72=25\n                    right_end = -12+72=60\n                    [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n          So at (6,3) we have three options: U, S, D.\n\n          But we want minimal H, so we would prefer U. So we try U first.\n\n          Then at (7,4) we try again:\n\n             U: next_y=5, t=8 -> check freeway5 at t=8:\n                  cars: same as freeway4? \n                  car1: (-18,-29,right,6) -> at t=8: [-29+6*3, -18+6*3] = [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision! \n                  So we cannot go to freeway5 at turn8 by U.\n\n             Then we try S: next_y=4, t=8 -> check freeway4 at t=8:\n                  car1: [-29+6*3, -18+6*3] = [-11,0] -> collision? \n                  But wait: at t=8, freeway4: \n                      car1: [-29+6*(8-5)= -29+18=-11, -18+18=0] -> so [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\n             Then D: next_y=3, t=8 -> check freeway3 at t=8:\n                  car1: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> collision? \n                  But wait, freeway3 at t=8: \n                      car1: (h=-18, tau=-29) -> becomes [-29+6*3, -18+6*3] = [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n          So all moves from (7,4) lead to collision? Then we need to backtrack.\n\n          Alternatively, at (6,3) we might choose S or D? \n\n          Let me check at (6,3) we have:\n\n            Option: S -> (7,3): \n                freeway3 at t=7: \n                    car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                    car2: [19+12,30+12]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\n            Then at (7,3) we try:\n\n                U: next_y=4, t=8 -> freeway4 at t=8: collision (as above, [ -11,0] for car1) -> collision.\n\n                S: next_y=3, t=8 -> freeway3 at t=8: car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n                D: next_y=2, t=8 -> freeway2 at t=8: \n                     car: [-47+36*(8-5)= -47+108=61, -12+108=96] -> [61,96] -> safe.\n\n                So D is safe: state (8,2, ['U','S','D'])\n\n            Then from (8,2) we try to go up? \n\n          Option: D at (6,3) -> (7,2): \n                freeway2 at t=7: \n                    car: [-47+36*2= -47+72=25, -12+72=60] -> safe.\n\n          Then from (7,2) we can try U to (8,3): \n                freeway3 at t=8: car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n          Or S: (8,2) -> safe? \n                freeway2 at t=8: [61,96] -> safe.\n\n          Or D: (8,1) -> freeway1 at t=8:\n                car1: [-47+6*3= -47+18=-29, -36+18=-18] -> safe? \n                car2: [31+18,42+18]=[49,60] -> safe.\n                car3: [-5+18,6+18]=[13,24] -> safe.\n                so safe.\n\n          So we have multiple paths, but we are not at y=9.\n\n          We see that going up from (6,3) to (7,4) was blocked at turn8. \n\n          What if we wait at freeway3 at turn6? Then at turn7 we are at freeway3 and then we try to go up at turn7 to freeway4 at turn8? But we saw freeway4 at turn8 is unsafe. \n\n          Alternatively, we can try to go down from (6,3) to (7,2) and then try to go up later.\n\n          But note: we started at (5,2) and we are at (6,3) and then (7,2) -> we are at y=2 at turn7, which is worse than the start? \n\n          We need a more systematic BFS.\n\n   Since BFS by time (and we are expanding by increasing t) and we want the minimal H, we can do BFS level by level (by t). We break when we find y=9.\n\n   We'll try to run the BFS with a queue (FIFO) but that might not be optimal? Actually, we are expanding by time, so the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal H.\n\n   We'll use a queue and do BFS.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        from (5,2, []) \n        Then we generate (6,1, ['D']), (6,3, ['U'])\n\n        Then from (6,1): \n            actions: \n                U: (7,2) -> freeway2 at t=7: [25,60] -> safe -> state (7,2, ['D','U'])\n                S: (7,1) -> freeway1 at t=7: \n                    car1: [-47+6*2=-35, -36+12=-24] -> safe? \n                    car2: [31+12=43,42+12=54] -> safe.\n                    car3: [-5+12=7, 6+12=18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n                D: (7,0) -> safe (since y=0)\n\n        Then from (6,3): we generate (7,4,['U','U']), (7,3,['U','S']), (7,2,['U','D'])\n\n        Then we consider t=7:\n\n            (7,2) from (6,1) and (6,3) -> two ways: \n                path1: ['D','U'] -> (7,2)\n                path2: ['U','D'] -> (7,2)\n\n            We mark (7,2) as visited? Then we only push one of them? Actually, it doesn't matter the path to (7,2) because the future is the same. So we mark visited (t,y) and we push only the first time we get to (t,y). But note: we might get the same (t,y) by different paths and we want the minimal H? Actually, we are expanding by t so the first time we get to (t,y) is with minimal H (since we do BFS by time, and all paths take the same time?).\n\n            Actually, the number of actions is (t-5). So at t=7, we have taken 2 actions. So the state (7,2) is the same regardless of the path.\n\n            So we mark (t,y) as visited.\n\n        Then we expand (7,2) (we do it once):\n\n            Actions: \n                U: (8,3) -> freeway3 at t=8: car1: [-11,0] -> collision -> skip.\n                S: (8,2) -> freeway2 at t=8: [61,96] -> safe -> push (8,2, ...) \n                D: (8,1) -> freeway1 at t=8: \n                    car1: [-47+6*3=-29, -36+18=-18] -> safe.\n                    car2: [31+18=49,42+18=60] -> safe.\n                    car3: [-5+18=13,6+18=24] -> safe.\n                    -> push (8,1, ...)\n\n        Similarly, we expand (7,1) and (7,0) and (7,3) and (7,4):\n\n            (7,0): \n                Actions: \n                    U: (8,1) -> we already generated? but we don't know, so we check: freeway1 at t=8: safe -> push (8,1, ['D','D','U']) \n                    S: (8,0) -> safe.\n                    D: (8,0) -> same? Actually, D from 0: max(0,0-1)=0 -> so same as S? \n                         But note: if at y=0, D: next_y = max(0,0-1)=0 -> so same as S.\n                    So we have two actions that lead to (8,0): S and D.\n\n            (7,1): \n                Actions:\n                    U: (8,2) -> freeway2 at t=8: [61,96] -> safe -> push (8,2, ['D','S','U']) \n                    S: (8,1) -> freeway1 at t=8: safe -> push (8,1, ['D','S','S'])\n                    D: (8,0) -> safe -> push (8,0, ...)\n\n            (7,3): \n                Actions:\n                    U: (8,4) -> freeway4 at t=8: car1: [-11,0] -> collision? \n                         Actually, freeway4: same as freeway3? \n                         car1: [-29+18=-11, -18+18=0] -> collision -> skip.\n                    S: (8,3) -> freeway3: collision -> skip.\n                    D: (8,2) -> freeway2: safe -> push (8,2, ['U','S','D'])  # but we already have (8,2) by other paths.\n\n            (7,4): \n                We already saw that all moves lead to collision? So we skip.\n\n        Now we have at t=8: \n            (8,2): by multiple paths -> we mark the first time we got to (8,2) and push one.\n            (8,1): multiple\n            (8,0): multiple\n\n        Then we continue.\n\n        We are not at y=9 yet.\n\n        We'll have to go to higher turns.\n\n        We note that we need to get to y=9. We are at y=2 at turn8 -> we need at least 7 more moves? But we can do it in 7 moves? \n\n        However, the cars are moving and the situation changes.\n\n        We see that at turn8, freeway3 and freeway4 are unsafe (because of the car1 on freeways 3-8: at turn8, car1 is at [-11,0] for freeway3? Actually, each freeway has its own cars? \n\n        Let me recalc for freeway4 at turn8: \n            The car1 on freeway4: h=-18, tau=-29, speed=6 -> at turn8: \n                left_end = -29 + 6*(8-5) = -29+18 = -11\n                right_end = -18 + 18 = 0\n            So [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway5 at turn8: same car? The table shows freeway5 has the same two cars: (-18,-29,right,6) and (30,19,right,6). So at turn8: \n            car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        So freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are all unsafe at turn8? \n\n        But wait: freeway3: same as above -> unsafe.\n        freeway4: same -> unsafe.\n        freeway5: same -> unsafe.\n        freeway6: same -> unsafe.\n        freeway7: same -> unsafe.\n        freeway8: same -> unsafe.\n\n        Only freeway1 and freeway2 are safe at turn8? \n\n        So at turn8, we can only be at freeway0,1,2,9? But we are at freeway0,1,2.\n\n        Then at turn8, we have states: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n\n        Now we expand (8,0): \n            Actions:\n                U: (9,1) -> freeway1 at t=9: \n                    car1: [-47+6*4=-23, -36+24=-12] -> safe? \n                    car2: [31+24=55,42+24=66] -> safe.\n                    car3: [-5+24=19,6+24=30] -> safe.\n                    -> push (9,1, ...)\n                S: (9,0) -> safe.\n                D: (9,0) -> same.\n\n        (8,1):\n            Actions:\n                U: (9,2) -> freeway2 at t=9: \n                    car: [-47+36*4= 144-47=97, -12+144=132] -> [97,132] -> safe.\n                S: (9,1) -> freeway1: safe as above.\n                D: (9,0) -> safe.\n\n        (8,2):\n            Actions:\n                U: (9,3) -> freeway3 at t=9: \n                    car1: [-29+6*4=-5, -18+24=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 in? no, because -5<=0<=6 -> yes, 0 is in [-5,6] -> collision.\n                S: (9,2) -> freeway2: safe -> push (9,2, ...)\n                D: (9,1) -> freeway1: safe.\n\n        So we push:\n            (9,1) from (8,0) and (8,1) and (8,2) [by D from (8,2)]\n            (9,0) from (8,0) \n            (9,2) from (8,1) and (8,2) [by S from (8,2)]\n\n        Then at t=9, we have states: (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\n        We need to continue.\n\n        We see that we are not making progress? \n\n        But note: at turn9, freeway3: car1: [-29+6*4=-5, -18+24=6] -> [ -5, 6] -> which includes 0 -> unsafe. So we cannot be on freeway3 at turn9.\n\n        freeway4: same: [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\n        So we avoid freeways 3 to 8 at turn9.\n\n        Then we expand (9,1): \n            U: (10,2) -> freeway2 at t=10: \n                car: [-47+36*5 = 180-47=133, -12+180=168] -> safe.\n            S: (10,1) -> freeway1 at t=10:\n                car1: [-47+6*5=-17, -36+30=-6] -> safe? \n                car2: [31+30=61,42+30=72] -> safe.\n                car3: [-5+30=25,6+30=36] -> safe.\n            D: (10,0) -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, (9,2): \n            U: (10,3) -> freeway3 at t=10: \n                car1: [-29+6*5=1, -18+30=12] -> [1,12] -> safe? 0 not in.\n                car2: [19+30=49,30+30=60] -> safe.\n                -> safe! \n\n            So we can go up to freeway3 at turn10? \n\n        Why is freeway3 safe at turn10? \n            car1: at t=10: \n                left_end = -29 + 6*(10-5) = -29+30 = 1\n                right_end = -18 + 30 = 12\n            -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n            car2: [19+30=49,30+30=60] -> safe.\n\n        So we can go to (10,3) from (9,2) by U.\n\n        Then we have a path: \n            From (9,2) we do U -> (10,3)\n\n        Then we are at freeway3 at turn10, which is safe.\n\n        Then we can continue: \n            At (10,3): \n                We try U: (11,4) -> freeway4 at t=11: \n                    car1: [-29+6*6=7, -18+36=18] -> [7,18] -> safe.\n                    car2: [19+36=55,30+36=66] -> safe.\n                -> safe.\n\n            Then (11,4): \n                U: (12,5) -> freeway5 at t=12: \n                    car1: [-29+6*7=13, -18+42=24] -> safe.\n                    car2: [19+42=61,30+42=72] -> safe.\n\n            Then (12,5): \n                U: (13,6) -> freeway6 at t=13: \n                    car1: [-29+6*8=19, -18+48=30] -> safe.\n                    car2: [19+48=67,30+48=78] -> safe.\n\n            Then (13,6): \n                U: (14,7) -> freeway7 at t=14: \n                    car1: [-29+6*9=25, -18+54=36] -> safe.\n                    car2: [19+54=73,30+54=84] -> safe.\n\n            Then (14,7): \n                U: (15,8) -> freeway8 at t=15: \n                    car1: [-29+6*10=31, -18+60=42] -> safe.\n                    car2: [19+60=79,30+60=90] -> safe.\n\n            Then (15,8): \n                U: (16,9) -> goal! safe.\n\n        So the entire path from (9,2) to (16,9) is 7 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\n        But how did we get to (9,2)? \n\n        Let me backtrack the path:\n\n            We started at (5,2) -> then we did something to get to (9,2).\n\n            How many actions from turn5 to turn9? 4 actions (from turn5 to turn6,6->7,7->8,8->9).\n\n            Then from turn9 to turn16: 7 actions.\n\n            Total actions: 4+7 = 11.\n\n        But we have to output the actions starting at turn5.\n\n        How did we get to (9,2)? \n\n            One path: \n                turn5: D -> to (6,1)\n                turn6: S -> to (7,1)\n                turn7: U -> to (8,2)\n                turn8: S -> to (9,2)\n\n            So actions: \n                turn5: D\n                turn6: S\n                turn7: U\n                turn8: S\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n                turn11: U\n                turn12: U\n                turn13: U\n                turn14: U\n                turn15: U\n\n            Total 11 actions.\n\n        But is there a shorter path?\n\n        We were doing BFS by time, so the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal H.\n\n        However, we found a path at turn16 (so H=11 actions: from turn5 to turn15, 11 actions? \n            Actually, the actions are taken at turns: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 -> 11 actions.\n\n        But note: we start at turn5 and we take an action at turn5 to get to turn6. Then we take 11 actions to get to turn5+11 = turn16, and at turn16 we are at y=9.\n\n        So H=11.\n\n        But let me see if there is a shorter path.\n\n        We tried to go up initially and got blocked, but maybe there is a path that goes up faster.\n\n        Alternatively, we could have taken the other branch: at turn5 we went up to (6,3). Then we tried to go up again to (7,4) but got blocked at turn8. But what if we wait at freeway3 at turn6 and turn7? \n\n        At (6,3): \n            We can do S at turn6: (7,3) -> safe? \n                freeway3 at turn7: \n                    car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                    car2: [31,42] -> safe.\n\n            Then at (7,3) we can only go down to (8,2) (because U and S at turn8 lead to collision) -> then we are at (8,2) at turn8.\n\n            Then from (8,2) we do S at turn8: (9,2) -> same as before.\n\n            Then from (9,2) we go up as before.\n\n            So the path: \n                turn5: U\n                turn6: S\n                turn7: D   (from 3 to 2)\n                turn8: S\n                turn9: U ... -> same 11 actions.\n\n        Or we could go down from (6,3) to (7,2) -> then we are at (7,2) and then we can go up to (8,3) at turn8? But freeway3 at turn8 is unsafe.\n\n        So the shortest is 11 actions.\n\n        But wait: is there a way to avoid the long detour?\n\n        What if at turn5 we go up to (6,3), then at turn6 we go up to (7,4) -> but at turn7 we are at freeway4 and we cannot stay or go up at turn8? But we could go down at turn7 to freeway3 at turn8? \n\n        At turn7: we are at (7,4). \n            If we go down: next_y=3, turn8.\n            Then freeway3 at turn8: car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        Alternatively, at turn7 we are at freeway4: we go down to freeway3 at turn8? -> collision.\n\n        So that path is blocked.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal path has 11 actions.\n\n        But note: we also had a path that went down at turn5: (6,1) and then we did S and U to get to (8,2) and then S to (9,2). That is the same length.\n\n        We'll output one of the shortest paths.\n\n        We'll choose the one that we found first? But in BFS, we found both (6,1) and (6,3) at the same time? \n\n        Actually, we generated (6,1) and (6,3) at the same level (t=6). Then we expanded (6,1) first? \n\n        We don't care which path, as long as it is minimal.\n\n        We can choose the path that goes down first: \n            turn5: D\n            turn6: S\n            turn7: U\n            turn8: S\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n            turn12: U\n            turn13: U\n            turn14: U\n            turn15: U\n\n        That's 11 actions.\n\n        But let me verify the positions:\n\n            t5: start at (0,2) -> action D -> \n            t6: at (0,1) -> safe? \n                freeway1 at t6: we checked: safe.\n\n            t6: action S -> \n            t7: at (0,1) -> freeway1 at t7: \n                car1: [-47+6*2=-35, -36+12=-24] -> safe.\n                car2: [31+12=43,42+12=54] -> safe.\n                car3: [-5+12=7,6+12=18] -> safe.\n\n            t7: action U -> \n            t8: at (0,2) -> freeway2 at t8: \n                car: [-47+36*3=108-47=61, -12+108=96] -> safe.\n\n            t8: action S -> \n            t9: at (0,2) -> freeway2 at t9: \n                car: [-47+36*4=144-47=97, -12+144=132] -> safe.\n\n            t9: action U -> \n            t10: at (0,3) -> freeway3 at t10: \n                car1: [-29+6*5=1, -18+30=12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n                car2: [19+30=49,30+30=60] -> safe.\n\n            t10: U -> t11: (0,4) -> freeway4 at t11: \n                car1: [-29+6*6=7, -18+36=18] -> safe.\n                car2: [19+36=55,30+36=66] -> safe.\n\n            t11: U -> t12: (0,5) -> freeway5 at t12: \n                car1: [-29+6*7=13, -18+42=24] -> safe.\n                car2: [19+42=61,30+42=72] -> safe.\n\n            t12: U -> t13: (0,6) -> freeway6 at t13: \n                car1: [-29+6*8=19, -18+48=30] -> safe.\n                car2: [19+48=67,30+48=78] -> safe.\n\n            t13: U -> t14: (0,7) -> freeway7 at t14: \n                car1: [-29+6*9=25, -18+54=36] -> safe.\n                car2: [19+54=73,30+54=84] -> safe.\n\n            t14: U -> t15: (0,8) -> freeway8 at t15: \n                car1: [-29+6*10=31, -18+60=42] -> safe.\n                car2: [19+60=79,30+60=90] -> safe.\n\n            t15: U -> t16: (0,9) -> goal.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n        We output the actions for turns 5 to 15.\n\n        Format:\n\n          Turn 5: D\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: S\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: U\n          Turn 14: U\n          Turn 15: U\n\n        But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". \n          Here, t1=5, so actions at t=5,6,...,15 (which are 11 actions: t from 0 to 10? because H=11, so t=0,...,10).\n\n        So we output:\n\n          Turn 5: D\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: S\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: U\n          Turn 14: U\n          Turn 15: U\n\n        But wait: the last action (at turn15) leads to y=9 at turn16. And we don't take an action at turn16? \n\n        How many actions: 11 actions, from turn5 to turn15.\n\n        So we output 11 lines.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        However, note that we could have taken the other path that goes up first and then down? \n\n        But the length is the same. We output one minimal path.\n\n        Let me see if there is a path with H=10? \n\n        We need to go from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves up. But we have to avoid 3 freeways that are unsafe at some turns? \n\n        We see that freeway3 to freeway8 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9? \n\n        And freeway2 is unsafe at turn6. \n\n        We had to wait at freeway1 and freeway2 for a few turns.\n\n        It seems 11 is minimal.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above.\n\n        But note: there is a path that goes up first and then down and then up? \n\n        We had: \n            turn5: U -> (6,3)\n            turn6: D -> (7,2)   [then we are at turn7 at freeway2: safe? freeway2 at turn7: [25,60] -> safe]\n            turn7: S -> (8,2)   [freeway2 at turn8: safe? [61,96] -> safe]\n            turn8: S -> (9,2)   [freeway2 at turn9: [97,132] -> safe]\n            then same as before: 7 ups.\n\n            Total actions: 11.\n\n        So we can also output:\n\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: D\n          Turn7: S\n          Turn8: S\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n          Turn13: U\n          Turn14: U\n          Turn15: U\n\n        This is also 11 actions.\n\n        We can choose either.\n\n        I'll choose the first one we found (the down first) because we found it in the BFS from the down branch.\n\n        However, the problem does not require a specific minimal path, just any minimal path.\n\n        We'll output the down first path.\n\n        But note: we must be cautious: at turn5 we went down to freeway1 at turn6. Then we stayed at turn6 (so at turn7 we are still at freeway1). Then we went up to freeway2 at turn8? \n\n        Actually, in the down first path we described above, we did:\n\n          turn5: D -> to y=1 at turn6.\n          turn6: S -> stay at y=1 at turn7.\n          turn7: U -> to y=2 at turn8.\n\n        But we have to check freeway1 at turn7: safe? yes.\n\n        And freeway2 at turn8: safe? yes.\n\n        So it is valid.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn 5: D\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: S\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: U\n          Turn 14: U\n          Turn 15: U\n\n        We are done.\n\n        However, note: at turn8 we did S, so we stayed at freeway2 at turn9? Then at turn9 we did U to freeway3 at turn10? \n\n        But at turn10, freeway3 was safe? yes.\n\n        So the entire path is safe.\n\n        We write the answer.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found H=11.\n\n        We output the sequence.\n\n        However, we must write the answer in the box.\n\n        Format:\n\n          \\boxed{\n          Turn 5: D\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: S\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: U\n          Turn 14: U\n          Turn 15: U\n          }\n\n        But note: the last action is at turn15, and after that at turn16 we are at (0,9). We don't take an action at turn16? \n\n        The problem says: a sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1. Here H=11, so we have 11 actions: at t=5 (which is the first action, t=0 in the sequence index) to t=15 (which is the 11th action, t=10 in the sequence index).\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above.\n\n        However, let me check if we can do it in 10 actions? \n\n        We need to be at y=9 at turn5+10 = turn15.\n\n        How? \n\n          We start at y=2 at turn5.\n          After 10 actions, we must have net +7 (because 2+7=9). \n\n          Let u be the number of U, d the number of D, s the number of S, then:\n             u - d = 7\n             u + d + s = 10\n          Then: 2u + s = 17 -> so u must be at least 7 and at most 10.\n\n          We can have u=7, then d=0, s=3: \n            actions: 7 U, 3 S.\n\n          Or u=8, d=1, s=1: \n            actions: 8U, 1D, 1S -> net 7.\n\n          etc.\n\n          Now, can we avoid collisions?\n\n          We have to traverse freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\n          The critical point is that freeways 3-8 are blocked at turn8 and turn9? \n\n          We must be at freeway3 at some turn. The earliest we can be at freeway3 is turn6 (if we go up at turn5 and turn6: then at turn6 we are at freeway3). Then at turn7 we can be at freeway4, turn8 at freeway5, ... but at turn8, freeway5 is blocked? \n\n          How about:\n\n            turn5: U -> y=3 at turn6\n            turn6: U -> y=4 at turn7\n            turn7: U -> y=5 at turn8 -> but freeway5 at turn8: blocked? \n            turn8: we have to avoid freeway5: we can only be at freeway0,1,2,9? but we are at freeway5 -> collision.\n\n          Alternatively, we can wait at freeway4 at turn7 and turn8? \n\n            turn5: U -> y=3 at turn6\n            turn6: U -> y=4 at turn7\n            turn7: S -> y=4 at turn8 -> freeway4 at turn8: blocked? \n                freeway4 at turn8: car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n          Or turn7: D -> y=3 at turn8 -> freeway3 at turn8: collision.\n\n          So we cannot be on freeways 3-8 at turn8.\n\n          Similarly, at turn9, freeways3-8 are blocked? \n\n          So we must be at freeway0,1,2,9 at turns8 and 9.\n\n          But we want to go up, so we have to be at freeway3 at some turn >=10? \n\n          The earliest we can be at freeway3 without collision is turn10 (as we saw, freeway3 at turn10 is safe).\n\n          Then we need to go from freeway3 to freeway9 in the next 6 moves (since we have 10 actions total, and we are at turn10 at freeway3, then we have 5 more actions? because from turn5 to turn10: 5 actions? \n\n          Actually, we started at turn5. \n            We take an action at turn5 -> turn6\n            ... \n            at turn10 we are at freeway3, which is the result of the 6th action? (actions at turn5,6,7,8,9,10) -> 6 actions.\n\n          Then we have 4 more actions (turn11,12,13,14) to get to freeway9? \n\n          We need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps. We need at least 6 moves up. But we only have 4 actions? -> impossible.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot reach y=9 by turn15 (which is after 10 actions) because we cannot get to freeway3 before turn10, and then we need 6 more moves to go from 3 to 9.\n\n          Hence, 10 actions is impossible.\n\n          Similarly, 11 is the minimal.\n\n        Therefore, we output the 11-action sequence.\n\n        We are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down initially to avoid unsafe freeways at critical turns, then waiting, and finally moving up consecutively once the path is clear.\n\nThe car positions evolve as follows:\n- All cars move right at given speeds.\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) (1 to 8) and the x-coordinate 0 is within a car's span at that turn.\n- Freeways 3 to 8 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9 due to cars spanning position 0. Freeway 2 is unsafe at turn 6.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- **Turn 5 (initial):** Move down (D) to freeway 1 at turn 6, avoiding freeway 2 which becomes unsafe.\n- **Turn 6:** Stay (S) at freeway 1, which is safe.\n- **Turn 7:** Move up (U) to freeway 2 at turn 8, as freeway 2 becomes safe again.\n- **Turn 8:** Stay (S) at freeway 2 to wait out unsafe freeways 3-8.\n- **Turns 9-15:** Move up (U) consecutively to freeways 3 to 9. Freeway 3 is safe at turn 10, and higher freeways are safe in subsequent turns as cars move away from position 0.\n\nThis path ensures safety and minimizes turns, reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 16.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{D} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{S} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{S} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U}\n\\end{align*}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=6, and I start at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, as per the direction. The car update rules say that for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]. Since they're moving right, the head is to the right, so h > τ.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, it says: (-30, -41, right, 6). That seems odd because -30 is greater than -41, so head is -30, tail is -41? But that would mean the car is from -41 to -30, which is length 11, and since it's moving right, s=6.\n\nSimilarly, (48,37,right,6): head 48, tail 37, so from 37 to 48, length 11.\n\nAnd (12,1,right,6): from 1 to 12, length 11.\n\nFor freeway 2: (24,-11,right,36): head 24, tail -11, so from -11 to 24, length 35.\n\nAnd freeways 3 to 8 all have the same: (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6). For (-12,-23,right,6): head -12, tail -23? -12 > -23, so span from -23 to -12, length 11. And (36,25,right,6): head 36, tail 25? 36>25, so from 25 to 36, length 11.\n\nIn the notation, it says (head h, tail τ), and for right-moving, it should be that h is the front, so h > τ, which it is in all cases except... for freeway 1, (-30,-41): -30 > -41, yes. (-30 is greater than -41). Similarly, (48,37): 48>37, yes. (12,1):12>1, yes. Freeway 2: (24,-11):24>-11, yes. And the others: (-12,-23): -12 > -23, and (36,25):36>25, all good.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}. But I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at each turn, I am on a specific row, and I check if 0 is in the car spans on that row for that turn.\n\nNow, I start at t=6, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1, 0, or +1 each turn, and y from 0 to 9, I need to go up to 9, which is 8 rows up from 1, so minimum turns if no obstacles would be 8 turns, all up moves.\n\nBut there are cars, so I might need to wait or something.\n\nFirst, let's look at the cars on each freeway at t=6.\n\nFreeway k=1: y=1\n\nCars: (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nI am at (0,1) at t=6, so I need to check if 0 is in any span on freeway 1 at t=6.\n\nFirst car: span at t=6: [τ, h] for right-moving, but from the update: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nt₁ is 6, so at T=6, Span(6) = [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] = [τ, h]\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nSo for freeway 1, cars at t=6:\n\nCar A: h=-30, τ=-41, so span [-41, -30]? No: for right-moving, it's [τ, h], so [ -41, -30 ] since τ=-41, h=-30.\n\nBut -41 to -30, and 0 is not between -41 and -30, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar B: (48,37,right,6), span [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nCar C: (12,1,right,6), span [1,12], and 0 is not in [1,12]? 1 to 12, 0 is less than 1, so not included. Since it's a closed interval? The span is [τ, h], so [1,12], which includes 1 and 12, but 0 is less than 1, so not in.\n\nBut I am at position 0, and the car is from 1 to 12, so at x=0, I am not on the car, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nBut on freeway 1, car C is at [1,12], so at x=1 to 12, I am at x=0, so not colliding.\n\nNow, at t=6, I am on y=1, and no car has 0 in span, so I am safe at t=6.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for t=6,7,8,... until I reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is in the span of a car, meaning it's dangerous to be on that row at that turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, their positions change over time.\n\nLet T be the turn number relative to t₁=6, so at time τ = T - 6, so at turn T, time since start τ = T - 6.\n\nThen for a car, at turn T, span for right-moving: [τ + s(τ), h + s(τ)] where τ = T - 6.\n\ns is speed, τ is time offset.\n\nSet δt = T - t₁ = T - 6.\n\nThen at turn T, car position: for right-moving, span [τ + s * δt, h + s * δt]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt for the interval.\n\nSince it's [low, high] with low = τ + s δt, high = h + s δt.\n\nFor right-moving, low = τ + s δt, high = h + s δt.\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nNow, for each car, we can find when this happens.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1:\n\nCars:\n\n1. (-30,-41,right,6): τ = -41, h = -30, s=6\n\nLow = τ + s δt = -41 + 6 δt\n\nHigh = h + s δt = -30 + 6 δt\n\n0 in [low, high] iff -41 + 6 δt ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6 δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-41 + 6 δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -30 + 6 δt\n\nFirst: -41 + 6 δt ≤ 0 => 6 δt ≤ 41 => δt ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30 + 6 δt => 30 ≤ 6 δt => δt ≥ 30/6 = 5\n\nSo for 5 ≤ δt ≤ 6.833, since δt integer, δt = 5,6\n\nAt δt=5: low = -41 + 30 = -11, high = -30 + 30 = 0\n\n[ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, so yes.\n\nAt δt=6: low = -41 + 36 = -5, high = -30 + 36 = 6, [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt δt=7: low=-41+42=1, high=-30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, dangerous at δt=5 and 6, i.e., turns T=6+5=11 and T=6+6=12? δt=0 is T=6.\n\nδt = T - 6, so at T=6, δt=0\n\nT=7, δt=1, etc.\n\nDangerous when δt=5 and 6: T=11 and 12.\n\nBut at T=6, δt=0, low=-41, high=-30, [ -41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nNow second car on y=1: (48,37,right,6), τ=37, h=48, s=6\n\nLow = 37 + 6 δt\n\nHigh = 48 + 6 δt\n\n37 + 6 δt ≤ 0? 37 + 6 δt is always positive since δt ≥0, min at δt=0 is 37>0, so low >0, so 0 < low ≤ high, so 0 never in [low, high] since low ≥37>0. So never dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (12,1,right,6), τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nLow =1 + 6 δt\n\nHigh=12 + 6 δt\n\nAlways ≥1>0, so 0 never in, never dangerous.\n\nSo on freeway 1, only the first car is dangerous at δt=5 and 6, i.e., turns T=11 and 12.\n\nBut at T=6, it's safe, as we saw.\n\nNow freeway y=2: only one car (24,-11,right,36)\n\nτ=-11, h=24, s=36\n\nLow = τ + s δt = -11 + 36 δt\n\nHigh = h + s δt = 24 + 36 δt\n\n0 in [low, high] iff -11 + 36 δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 36 δt\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 24 + 36 δt always true since δt≥0.\n\n-11 + 36 δt ≤ 0 => 36 δt ≤ 11 => δt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSince δt integer ≥0, only possible for δt=0\n\nAt δt=0: low=-11, high=24, [-11,24], 0 in it.\n\nFor δt=1: low=-11+36=25, high=24+36=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at δt=0, turn T=6, it is dangerous.\n\nAt T=6, on freeway 2, this car has span [-11,24], which includes 0, so if I am on y=2 at T=6, I would collide, but I am not on y=2 at t=6, I am on y=1.\n\nBut for future, if I go to y=2 at some turn, I need to avoid when 0 is in span.\n\nHere, only dangerous at T=6, δt=0.\n\nFor T>6, it's safe for this car on y=2.\n\nNow freeways y=3 to y=8, all have two cars each, both with s=6.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,6), τ=-23, h=-12\n\nLow = τ + s δt = -23 + 6 δt\n\nHigh = h + s δt = -12 + 6 δt\n\n0 in [low, high] iff -23 + 6 δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 6 δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-23 + 6 δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 + 6 δt\n\nFirst: -23 + 6 δt ≤ 0 => 6 δt ≤ 23 => δt ≤ 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 + 6 δt => 12 ≤ 6 δt => δt ≥ 2\n\nSo for δt = 2,3\n\nAt δt=2: low=-23+12=-11, high=-12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt δt=3: low=-23+18=-5, high=-12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt δt=1: low=-23+6=-17, high=-12+6=-6, [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nδt=4: low=-23+24=1, high=-12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo dangerous at δt=2,3, T=8,9\n\nSecond car on each y=3-8: (36,25,right,6), τ=25, h=36, s=6\n\nLow=25+6δt, high=36+6δt, always ≥25>0, so 0 never in, never dangerous.\n\nSo for each freeway y=3 to 8, only the first car is dangerous at δt=2,3, i.e., turns T=8 and 9.\n\nNow, freeway y=9? No, freeways are y=1 to 8, and I need to reach (0,9), which is above the freeways, so no cars on y=9, I assume. The grid has y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so always safe once I am there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe or not, but I start at y=1.\n\nNow, I start at t=6, y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay).\n\ny must stay within [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I need to go up, down might not be useful, but I might need to wait or avoid.\n\nBut in this case, let's see the dangers.\n\nFirst, on y=1, it is dangerous only at T=11 and 12, which are far, but I start at t=6, so I can leave y=1 early.\n\nOn y=2, dangerous only at T=6, which is now, but I am not there.\n\nFor y=3 to 8, dangerous at T=8 and 9.\n\nT=8 and 9 are δt=2 and 3, T=6+2=8, 6+3=9.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=1 to y=9, I need at least 8 up moves, but I can mix with stay or down, but that would increase turns, so to minimize H, I should avoid down and minimize stay.\n\nBut I might need to stay to avoid being on dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nNow, let's list for each row and each turn whether it is safe or dangerous.\n\nTurns: let's consider from T=6 to, say, T=15, but since min turns to go up is 8, H at least 8, so up to T=14 or so.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nDefine the safety for each row at each turn.\n\ny=0: no cars, always safe, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=9: no cars, safe.\n\ny=1: dangerous at T=11 and 12.\n\nAt other times, safe? Earlier, only that one car dangerous at T=11,12.\n\nAt T=6, we saw no danger, similarly for other T except 11,12.\n\ny=2: dangerous only at T=6, as per the car. At other times, safe.\n\ny=3 to y=8: dangerous at T=8 and 9 for each.\n\nNow, since all y=3 to 8 have the same car configuration, they all have danger at T=8 and 9.\n\nNow, I start at T=6, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe danger zones are:\n\n- At T=8 and 9, y=3 to 8 are dangerous, so I should not be on y=3-8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\n- At T=11 and 12, y=1 is dangerous.\n\nBut T=11 and 12 are later, I might be gone by then.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=3-8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are close.\n\nLet me see the sequence.\n\nLet t be the turn, starting from t=6.\n\nAt t=6: I am at y=1. Safe, as established.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=2 at t=7.\n\nIf I stay, y=1 at t=7.\n\nIf down, to y=0, but y=0 might be safe, but going down might not help since I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=7: what is safety?\n\ny=2 is dangerous only at t=6, which is past, so at t=7, y=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=7: is it dangerous?\n\ny=3 dangerous at t=8 and 9, not at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, δt=1, for y=3 car: the first car, low = -23 + 6*1 = -17, high=-12+6=-6, [-17,-6], 0 not in, and second car not dangerous, so y=3 safe at t=7.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, let's plan.\n\nI need to not be on y=3-8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are two consecutive turns.\n\nSince I move one row per turn at most, I need to be either below y=3 or above y=8 at those turns.\n\ny=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the target, I might not be there yet.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Be on y=0,1,2 at t=8 and t=9.\n\n- Or be on y=9 at t=8 or t=9, but since t=8 and t=9, I need to be there for both or one? No, I need to not be on y=3-8 at both t=8 and t=9 separately.\n\nAt each turn, I must not be on a dangerous row.\n\nSo for t=8, I must not be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nSo I need to be on y=0,1,2 or 9 at t=8 and at t=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, at t=6, I am at y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nLet me see how fast I can go.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nStart: t=6, y=1\n\nAction at t=6: U, then at t=7, y=2\n\nNow, at t=7, y=2, safe (as above)\n\nAction at t=7: U, to y=3 at t=8\n\nBut at t=8, y=3 is dangerous! Because t=8, δt=2, for y=3, car span [-11,0] or something, 0 in, collision.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at t=8, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to any y=3-8 at t=8, collide.\n\nSo at t=8, I cannot be on y=3-8.\n\nIf I go up at t=7 to y=3 at t=8, I am on y=3 at t=8, which is dangerous.\n\nSo not good.\n\nI could stay or go down at some point.\n\nSince y=3-8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, I need to be below or above during those turns.\n\nNow, at t=6, y=1.\n\nt=7: if I go up to y=2, or stay y=1, or down to y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I need to be on y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut I can't be on y=9 that early.\n\nSimilarly at t=9.\n\nNow, min y to reach 9: from y=1, need 8 up moves.\n\nBut with delays.\n\nLet me consider the turns around t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=6: y=1, safe\n\nt=7: I can be at y=0,1,2\n\nIf I go U to y=2\n\nOr S to y=1\n\nOr D to y=0\n\nNow, at t=8, I must be on y<=2 or y=9, impossible, so y<=2.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y<=2 or y=9.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut if I am at y<=2 at t=8 and t=9, that means I stay low for two turns, which might cost extra turns.\n\nSince t=8 and t=9 are bad for y=3-8, I can be on y=3-8 before or after.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at t=8, if I am on y=3, dangerous, but if I move to y=4 at t=8, but when I move to y=4 at t=8, at turn t=8, I am on y=3? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, and I check collision on y_T at time T.\n\nIf I choose to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so no collision check for y_{T+1} at time T.\n\nOnly for y_T at time T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=8, if I am on y=3, I check collision on y=3 at t=8.\n\nIf I choose to go up to y=4 at t=8, then at t=8, I am on y=3, so I check y=3, which is dangerous at t=8, so I collide.\n\nIf I stay on y=3, same.\n\nBut if I were to go down to y=2 at t=8, then at t=8, I am on y=3 if I was there, still collide.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=8, I must not be on y=3-8 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nOption 1: be on y<=2 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=6: y=1\n\nIf I go S at t=6, stay y=1 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, from y=1, I can go U to y=2 at t=8? At t=8, I need to be on y<=2.\n\nIf at t=7, y=1, I can choose to go U to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=2, which is <=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y=2, I need to be safe at t=9 as well.\n\nAt t=9, I need to be on y<=2 or y=9.\n\ny=9 not possible yet.\n\nSo at t=8, y=2, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=3 at t=9, but at t=9, y=3 is dangerous, so I would be on y=3 at t=9, collide.\n\nIf I stay S at t=8, y=2 at t=9, safe.\n\nOr go D to y=1 at t=9.\n\nSo to stay safe, I need to be at y<=2 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen after t=9, I can go up.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, for example.\n\nThen from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, so at least 7 turns, reaching y=9 at t=9 + 7 = 16, but actions from t=9 to t=15, 7 actions, y from 2 to 9 at t=16.\n\nLet's index.\n\nt=6: y=1\n\nAction at t=6: S, so y=1 at t=7\n\nAction at t=7: U, so y=2 at t=8\n\nAction at t=8: S, so y=2 at t=9  (since we need to stay at t=9)\n\nThen action at t=9: U, to y=3 at t=10\n\nNow, at t=10, y=3: is it safe?\n\ny=3 dangerous only at t=8 and 9, t=10 is δt=4, safe as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, all y=3-8 safe after t=9.\n\nt=10, δt=4, for y=3 car, low=-23+24=1, high=-12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other dangers except y=1 at t=11,12, but I am not there.\n\nSo from t=10, I can go up every turn.\n\nAt t=10, y=3\n\nU to y=4 at t=11\n\nU to y=5 at t=12\n\nU to y=6 at t=13\n\nU to y=7 at t=14\n\nU to y=8 at t=15\n\nU to y=9 at t=16\n\nThen at t=16, y=9, reached.\n\nH = number of actions? From t=6 to t=16, I have actions at t=6 to t=15, 10 actions.\n\nt=6 to t=15 inclusive, that's 10 turns? Turns: action at turn t determines y_{t+1}, but the position is after action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI start at turn t=6, y=1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H} = y_{6 + H}, and I need y_{6+H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=6: action S, so y_7 = y_6 + 0 = 1\n\nt=7: action U, y_8 = 1 +1 =2\n\nt=8: action S, y_9 =2 +0=2\n\nt=9: action U, y_10=2+1=3\n\nt=10: U, y_11=4\n\nt=11: U, y_12=5\n\nt=12: U, y_13=6\n\nt=13: U, y_14=7\n\nt=14: U, y_15=8\n\nt=15: U, y_16=9\n\nSo at t=16, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=6 to t=15, that's 10 actions, H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? I used one stay at t=6 and one at t=8, so two stays, which cost extra.\n\nCan I do with fewer?\n\nPerhaps I don't need to stay at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, I could go up immediately.\n\nt=6: action U, so y_7 = y_6 +1 = 1+1=2\n\nNow at t=7, y=2, safe.\n\nNow at t=7, I need to choose action for t=7.\n\nt=8 is coming, I need to not be on y=3-8 at t=8.\n\nAt t=7, y=2.\n\nIf I go U to y=3 at t=8, but at t=8, y=3 dangerous, collide.\n\nSo I cannot go up to y=3 at t=8.\n\nI could stay at y=2 or go down.\n\nIf I go S at t=7, y_8 = y_7 +0 =2, so at t=8, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=2, I need for t=9.\n\nAt t=9, I need to be not on y=3-8.\n\nIf I go U at t=8 to y=3 at t=9, but at t=9, y=3 dangerous, collide.\n\nSo I need to stay or go down at t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=8, action S, y_9 =2, so at t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen same as before, from t=9, y=2, then go up to y=3 at t=10, etc., reaching y=9 at t=16 as before.\n\nBut in this case, I didn't stay at t=6, I went up at t=6 to y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen stayed at t=7 and t=8? At t=7: S, y_8=2\n\nt=8: S, y_9=2\n\nThen t=9: U, y_10=3\n\n...\n\nto t=15: U, y_16=9\n\nSame as before, 10 actions.\n\nBut at t=7, I could go down to y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at t=8? y=1 dangerous only at t=11,12, so at t=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nAnother idea: I could be on y=9 by t=9 or earlier.\n\nt=8 is turn 8, I need to be at y=9 or below 2.\n\nBut y=9 from y=1 in two turns? Impossible, min 8 up moves.\n\nAt t=6, y=1, after one up, t=7 y=2, after two up t=8 y=3, but y=3 dangerous at t=8.\n\nCannot.\n\nt=8 y=3 not possible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach y=9 by t=8 or t=9.\n\nSo must be below at those turns.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to higher rows before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=1, go U to y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, instead of staying, go U? But if go U at t=7 to y=3 at t=8, collide.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=7, go down to y=1? Then at t=8, if I am y=1, which is safe, since y=1 safe except t=11,12.\n\nt=8 is δt=2, for y=1, no danger, as we saw only at t=11,12.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThen at t=8, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I need to be not on y=3-8, so y=2 is ok.\n\nThen at t=9, y=2, go U to y=3 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut let's see the sequence:\n\nt=6: U, y_7=2\n\nt=7: D, y_8=2-1=1? y_8 = y_7 + delta, if a_7=D, y_8 = y_7 -1 =2-1=1\n\nAt t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nThen action at t=8: U, y_9 =1+1=2\n\nAt t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen t=9: U, y_10=3\n\nSame as before, but I used a down move, which is worse, now I have an extra down, so from y=1 at t=8 to y=2 at t=9, then to y=3 at t=10, to y=9 at t=16, but with down, it takes same or more turns? From t=9 y=2 to t=10 y=3, t=11 y=4, ..., t=15 y=7, t=16 y=8, t=17 y=9, so t=17, worse.\n\nt=8 y=1, t=9 U to y=2, t=10 U to y=3, ..., t=16 U to y=9? From y=3 at t=10 to y=9 at t=16: y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, t=10 to t=15: t=10 y=3, t=11 y=4, t=12 y=5, t=13 y=6, t=14 y=7, t=15 y=8, t=16 y=9, so y=9 at t=16.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut in this case with down, I have one extra action? No: in the first sequence without down: t=6 S, y_7=1; t=7 U, y_8=2; t=8 S, y_9=2; t=9 U, y_10=3; ... t=15 U, y_16=9. Actions t=6 to t=15, 10 actions.\n\nWith down: t=6 U, y_7=2; t=7 D, y_8=1; t=8 U, y_9=2; t=9 U, y_10=3; ... t=15 U, y_16=9. Actions t=6 to t=15, but y_16=9, same 10 actions, but I used a down, which didn't save anything.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=9 y=2 to t=10 y=3, etc., to t=15 U to y_16=9, so actions up to t=15.\n\nBut in this down sequence, I have t=7 D, which is inefficient.\n\nBetter to stay or go up directly without down.\n\nBut in both cases, H=10.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=9 by t=9, but impossible from y=1 in 3 turns.\n\nt=6 y=1, t=7 y=2, t=8 y=3, but t=8 y=3 dangerous, and even if not, y=3 to y=9 needs 6 more turns, t=14 at best.\n\nBut t=8 y=3 not possible.\n\nAfter t=9, I can go up fast.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am at y=2, I go to y=3 at t=10, etc., min to y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at a higher y at t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=1, go U to y=2 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, I cannot go up because t=8 would be y=3 dangerous.\n\nBut what if at t=7, I go to y=3? No, at t=7, if I go U, y_8=3, but at t=8, I am on y=3, dangerous.\n\nUnless I move at t=8 to another row, but at the turn, I am on y=3 when I check.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nAt t=6, go D to y=0 at t=7? y_7 = y_6 -1 =1-1=0 if D.\n\nThen at t=7, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I can go U to y=1 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, safe (since danger only t=11,12)\n\nThen at t=8, go U to y=2 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from t=9, y=2, same as before.\n\nStill reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut at t=8, y=1, I could go U to y=2 at t=9, but at t=9, y=2 safe.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut y=1 at t=8 to y=9: from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, t=8 to t=15: t=8 y=1, t=9 U y=2, t=10 U y=3, ..., t=15 U y=8, t=16 U y=9, same t=16.\n\nIf I go up faster from t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=1, I can only go to y=2 at t=9, then y=3 at t=10, etc., no faster.\n\nUnless I was higher at t=8, but I can't because of the danger.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go up to y=3 at t=7, which is safe, then at t=7, I am at y=3.\n\nt=7, y=3 is safe, as δt=1.\n\nThen at t=7, if I go U to y=4 at t=8, but at t=8, I am on y=4? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=7, I am at y=3, I choose action for t=7.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_8 = y_7 +1 =4.\n\nAt turn t=8, I am at y_8 =4.\n\nNow, at t=8, y=4 is dangerous because y=4 has cars dangerous at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for all y=3-8.\n\nSo I would collide at t=8 on y=4.\n\nIf I choose to go down at t=7, say to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on y=2, which is safe.\n\nBut at t=7, I was on y=3, which is safe, then I go down to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=2 safe.\n\nThen for t=9, similarly, I need to be safe.\n\nAt t=8, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at t=9, but at t=9, y=3 dangerous, collide.\n\nSo I need to stay or go down at t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=8, S, y_9=2, safe at t=9.\n\nThen from t=9, y=2, go up, same as before.\n\nBut I went to y=3 at t=7 and back down, which cost extra and didn't help.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not useful.\n\nTherefore, the best is to stay low during t=8 and t=9.\n\nSpecifically, be on y=1 or 2 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn the first sequence, I was at y=1 or 2.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should start going up as soon as possible after that.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to wait until t=9 to start going up from y=2.\n\nAt t=9, I am at y=2, then go to y=3 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=2 at t=9 but start from higher?\n\nFor example, at t=6, go U to y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I must choose to stay or go down to be safe at t=8.\n\nIf stay at t=7, y_8=2, safe at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I must stay or go down to be safe at t=9.\n\nIf I stay at t=8, y_9=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, go U to y=3 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut at t=9, after action, y_10=3.\n\nNow, what about y=1 at t=11 and 12? But I am not on y=1 at those times, so no problem.\n\nIn this sequence, I used no down, only up and stay.\n\nActions: t=6: U, to y_7=2\n\nt=7: S, to y_8=2\n\nt=8: S, to y_9=2\n\nt=9: U, to y_10=3\n\nt=10: U, to y_11=4\n\nt=11: U, to y_12=5\n\nt=12: U, to y_13=6\n\nt=13: U, to y_14=7\n\nt=14: U, to y_15=8\n\nt=15: U, to y_16=9\n\nSame as before, H=10 actions from t=6 to t=15.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier than t=16?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=3 at t=10, but in above I am at y=3 at t=10.\n\nt=10 y=3 to t=16 y=9, that's 6 turns for 6 rows, must be.\n\nUnless I can be higher at t=10.\n\nBut at t=9, I need to be at y<=2 or 9, so at most y=2 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=10, y=3, which is the earliest.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=9 without intermediate, but no, must move step by step.\n\nAnother thought: at t=9, if I could be at y=9, but from y=1 at t=6, min 8 up moves, so at t=14 at earliest, but t=14 is after t=9.\n\nt=6 y=1, t=7 y=2, t=8 y=3 (but not possible), so earliest possible y=9 is t=14 if no delays: t=6 y=1, U t=7 y=2, U t=8 y=3, but t=8 y=3 dangerous, cannot, so must delay, thus min at t=16 as above.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 or something.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9 takes more steps.\n\nFor example, at t=6, go D to y=0 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=0, go U to y=1 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=2 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, safe.\n\nThen U to y=3 at t=10, etc., same as before, but started from lower, so from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, t=7 y=0 to t=16 y=9, with actions from t=7 to t=15, but I have action at t=6 D, so more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the minimal is H=10 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two stays or one stay and one up, but in the first sequence with t=6 U, t=7 S, t=8 S, t=9 U, etc.\n\nNow, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if at some point I might be in danger.\n\nFor example, at t=11, y=4? In the sequence, at t=11, y=4, which is safe, since y=4 dangerous only at t=8 and 9, past.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\ny=1 at t=11 and 12 dangerous, but I am not on y=1.\n\nIn this sequence, I am at y=2 at t=8 and t=9, then moving up.\n\nBut at t=11, I am at y=4, not y=1.\n\nNow, another thing: freeway y=8 has cars, dangerous at t=8 and 9, but at t=14, when I go to y=8, it should be safe.\n\nt=14, δt=8, for y=8 car: low = -23 + 6*8 = -23+48=25, high=-12+48=36, [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose I can reach y=9 at t=15.\n\nThat means y_{15} =9.\n\nThen y_{14} must be 8, and action U at t=14.\n\ny_{13} =7 or 8, etc.\n\nFrom start, at t=6 y=1.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at t=15 y=9.\n\nSo the position sequence: t=6 y=1, t=7 y=?, ..., t=15 y=9.\n\nNow, at t=8 and t=9, I need y_t <=2 or =9.\n\nBut y=9 impossible at t=8 or 9.\n\nSo y_8 <=2 and y_9 <=2.\n\nNow, from t=6 y=1 to t=7 y=?, if I go U, y_7=2.\n\nIf S, y_7=1.\n\nIf D, y_7=0.\n\nNow, y_7 must be such that I can have y_8 <=2.\n\nSince y_8 = y_7 + delta, with delta -1,0,1, so if y_7=0,1,2, I can have y_8 <=2 easily.\n\nSimilarly for y_9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=15, I need net +8 in y from t=6 to t=15.\n\nThe changes: from t=6 to t=14, 9 actions determine y_7 to y_15.\n\ny_15 = y_6 + sum of delta from t=6 to t=14.\n\ny_6=1, y_15=9, so sum delta = +8.\n\nNumber of actions: 9 actions (t=6 to t=14) to go from y_6 to y_15.\n\ny_15 = y_6 + delta_t6 + delta_t7 + ... + delta_t14\n\nEach delta in {-1,0,1}, sum must be +8.\n\nWith 9 actions, min sum +8 if all U except one S or something, but sum of 9 terms each <=1, so max sum 9, min -9.\n\nTo have sum=8, I need eight +1 and one 0, or seven +1 and one +1 and one -1 but that would be less, etc.\n\nPossibilities: eight U and one S, or nine U but that would be sum=9, y=10>9 not allowed, since y<=9.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so if I go all U, from y=1, y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, then y=10 invalid, so I cannot go above 9.\n\nTherefore, to reach y=9 from y=1 in 8 steps with all U, but here with 9 actions to reach in 9 steps? Let's see.\n\nIf I start at t=6 y=1, after k actions, at t=6+k, y_{6+k}.\n\nI need y_{6+H} =9.\n\nH actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t=6+H.\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\nMin H such that I can reach in H actions.\n\nWith H actions, I can increase y by at most H, from 1 to min(1+H,9).\n\nTo reach 9, since 1 + 8 =9, min H=8 with all U.\n\nBut due to obstacles, may need more.\n\nWith H=8 actions: t=6 to t=13, y_{14} = y_6 + sum_{t=6 to 13} delta y_t\n\ny_6=1, y_14=9, so sum delta =8, so all U, no choice.\n\nSequence: t=6 U, y_7=2\n\nt=7 U, y_8=3\n\nBut at t=8, y=3, dangerous, collide.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I do something else, but sum must be +8, so only all U possible, but y=3 at t=8 collide.\n\nThus impossible with H=8.\n\nH=9 actions: t=6 to t=14, y_{15} = y_6 + sum_{t=6 to 14} delta y_t =1 + sum =9, so sum=8.\n\nSince 9 actions, sum=8, so I must have eight U and one S, or seven U and one D and one U, but net +8 with 9 actions.\n\nEach U +1, S 0, D -1.\n\nLet u = number of U, s = S, d = D, u+s+d=9, and u - d =8, since net +8.\n\nThen u - d =8, u + s + d =9.\n\nAdd: 2u + s =17, subtract: 2d + s =1.\n\nSince s >=0, d>=0, 2d + s =1, so possible d=0, s=1 or d=1, s=-1 impossible, so d=0, s=1.\n\nThus one S and eight U.\n\nSo exactly one stay and eight ups.\n\nNow, I need to place the stay somewhere not causing collision.\n\nThe positions: start t=6 y=1.\n\nAfter actions, y_{15}=9.\n\nNow, at t=8 and t=9, y_t <=2.\n\ny_t at t=8 and t=9 must be <=2.\n\nSince I have eight U and one S, y increases from 1 to 9.\n\nThe S means I stay at some row for one turn.\n\nNow, the values: let me denote the y sequence.\n\ny_6=1\n\ny_7: after a_6, if U, y_7=2; if S, y_7=1; if D, y_7=0 but D not possible since we have no D, only U or S.\n\nIn this case, only U and S, no D.\n\nSo possible y_7: if a_6=U, y_7=2; if a_6=S, y_7=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, y_8: depends on y_7 and a_7.\n\nWe need y_8 <=2.\n\nSimilarly y_9 <=2.\n\nNow, since I have to reach y_15=9, and only one S, I must go up most of the time.\n\ny_8 <=2.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nIf y_7=1, then a_7 can be U or S.\n\nIf U, y_8=2; if S, y_8=1.\n\nIf y_7=2, then a_7 can be U, but y_8=3>2 not allowed since y_8<=2 required; or S, y_8=2; or D, but no D.\n\nSo if y_7=2, then to have y_8<=2, I must do S, so y_8=2.\n\nSimilarly for y_9.\n\nNow, let's see from start.\n\ny_6=1\n\na_6: if U, then y_7=2\n\nThen since y_7=2, to have y_8<=2, I must have a_7=S, so y_8=2\n\nThen y_8=2, now need y_9<=2.\n\na_8: if U, y_9=3>2 not allowed; if S, y_9=2; if D, not possible.\n\nSo must a_8=S, y_9=2\n\nThen y_9=2\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y_15=9.\n\ny_9=2 to y_15=9, need +7, with actions from t=9 to t=14, 6 actions.\n\nBut 6 actions for +7 increase? Impossible, since max increase 6 with 6 U, to y=8, but need to y=9.\n\ny_9=2, after 6 actions (t=9 to t=14), y_15 = y_9 + sum delta from t=9 to 14.\n\ny_15=9, so sum delta from t=9 to 14 must be +7.\n\nBut 6 actions, each delta <=1, max sum +6, so y_15 <= 2+6=8 <9, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf at a_6, I do S instead.\n\na_6=S, y_7=1\n\nThen y_7=1\n\nNow, a_7: can U or S.\n\nIf U, y_8=2\n\nIf S, y_8=1\n\nNow, need y_8<=2, both ok.\n\nSimilarly y_9<=2.\n\nFirst, suppose a_7=U, y_8=2\n\nThen y_8=2, need y_9<=2.\n\na_8: must not U, because y_9=3>2; so must S or D, but no D, so a_8=S, y_9=2\n\nThen y_9=2, same as before, need to y_15=9 with 6 actions, impossible to +7.\n\nIf at a_7, I do S, so y_8=1\n\nThen y_8=1\n\nNow a_8: can U or S.\n\nIf U, y_9=2 <=2 ok\n\nIf S, y_9=1 <=2 ok\n\nNow, say a_8=U, y_9=2\n\nThen y_9=2, again need to y_15=9 with 6 actions, impossible.\n\nIf a_8=S, y_9=1\n\nThen y_9=1, need to y_15=9 with 6 actions, +8 needed, but max +6, impossible.\n\nIf at y_8=1, a_8=S, y_9=1, then to y_15=9 need +8 with 6 actions, impossible.\n\nAll cases with H=9 lead to y_9<=2, and from there to y_15=9 need at least 7 steps (since y_9=2 to y_9=9 is 7, but with actions starting t=9 to t=15 for y_16=9, but here for H=9, we are considering y_15=9, so from t=9 to t=14 actions for y_15.\n\ny_9 to y_15 with 6 actions.\n\nIf y_9=2, min y_15=8 with all U, or 9 if I go up faster, but max y_15=2+6=8<9.\n\nSimilarly if y_9=1, max y_15=7<9.\n\nThus impossible to reach y_15=9 with y_9<=2.\n\nTherefore, H=9 is impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nWith H=10, we have sequences as above.\n\nIn the sequence, I can choose to go up at t=6 or not.\n\nFor example, one sequence: t=6: U, t=7: S, t=8: S, t=9: U, t=10: U, t=11: U, t=12: U, t=13: U, t=14: U, t=15: U\n\nThen y: t=6:1, t=7:2 (after a6 U), t=8:2 (a7 S), t=9:2 (a8 S), t=10:3 (a9 U), ..., t=16:9 (after a15 U)\n\nActions from t=6 to t=15.\n\nAnother sequence: t=6: S, then y_7=1, t=7: U, y_8=2, t=8: S, y_9=2, then same as above.\n\nIn this case, at t=6 S, I stay at y=1, which is safe, then proceed.\n\nBoth H=10.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 2 has a car with s=36, but we handled it, only dangerous at t=6.\n\nNow, let's write the actions.\n\nI think I'll go with the first sequence: go up immediately, then stay twice to avoid the danger times.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1 =6: a_{6} = U\n\nThen at t=7, since y=2, and to stay safe at t=8, I need to not go up, so S.\n\nIn the sequence: t=6: U\n\nt=7: S  (stay at y=2 for t=8)\n\nt=8: S  (stay at y=2 for t=9)\n\nt=9: U  (to y=3 at t=10)\n\nt=10: U  (y=4 at t=11)\n\nt=11: U  (y=5 at t=12)\n\nt=12: U  (y=6 at t=13)\n\nt=13: U  (y=7 at t=14)\n\nt=14: U  (y=8 at t=15)\n\nt=15: U  (y=9 at t=16)\n\nNow, H=10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=11, y=4, t=12 y=5, etc., all safe.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=6, H=10, so from turn 6 to turn 15.\n\nActions: a6 to a15.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 9: U, which is a9, leading to y10=3.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 has a car that is dangerous at t=11,12, but in this sequence, I am not on y=1 at those times, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10, with actions from turn 6 to turn 15.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Danger Times for Freeways**:\n  - Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is dangerous at turns 11 and 12 due to a car spanning \\([-41, -30]\\) at \\(t = 6\\) moving right at speed 6, causing 0 to be in its span at \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is dangerous only at turn 6 due to a car spanning \\([-11, 24]\\) at \\(t = 6\\) moving right at speed 36, but this is avoided as the player starts at \\(y = 1\\).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous at turns 8 and 9 due to cars spanning \\([-23, -12]\\) at \\(t = 6\\) moving right at speed 6, causing 0 to be in their spans at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\).\n- **Avoidance Strategy**: To avoid collisions at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\), the player must be on \\(y \\leq 2\\) (i.e., \\(y = 0, 1, 2\\)) or \\(y = 9\\) at these turns. Since \\(y = 9\\) is unreachable by \\(t = 8\\) or \\(t = 9\\) from \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 6\\), the player must be on \\(y \\leq 2\\) at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\).\n- **Minimal Turns**: The player starts at \\(y = 1\\) and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring a net increase of 8 in \\(y\\)-coordinate. The minimal path without delays would take 8 turns with all \"U\" actions, but the danger at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) forces a delay. With \\(H = 10\\), the sequence uses 8 \"U\" actions and 2 \"S\" actions to stay safe during danger turns.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=7, and I start at y=2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, based on the direction given. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], since head and tail are given with head > tail for right-moving, I think.\n\nLet me confirm the car update rule. It says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], and for right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. In the table, for freeway 1, it has (-24,-35,right,6), which seems odd because -24 is greater than -35, so if it's right-moving, head should be larger, but -24 > -35, so head is -24, tail is -35? But -24 is greater than -35, so [τ, h] would be [-35, -24] since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nI need to parse the car state.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars are (-24, -35, right, 6). Since direction is right, and head and tail are given, but in the span, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head. Here, it's given as (h, τ, d, s) I think? Look at the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nIn the table header: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]? No, let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] meaning from head to tail, I assume h and τ are positions.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] so tail to head.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head h, tail τ, d, s), so for each car, we have head position, tail position, direction, speed.\n\nFor right-moving, since Span(t1) = [τ, h], so if τ < h, it's increasing from left to right.\n\nIn freeway 1, first car: head = -24, tail = -35, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSince direction is right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But τ = tail = -35, h = head = -24, so [ -35, -24 ] which is from left to right, since -35 < -24.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (54,43,right,6), so head=54, tail=43, so Span(t1) = [43,54]? τ=43, h=54, so [43,54].\n\nBut in the list it's (54,43,right,6), which is (h,τ,d,s), so head=54, tail=43.\n\nSpan(t1) for right-moving is [τ, h] = [43,54].\n\nThird car: (18,7,right,6), so [7,18].\n\nAll on freeway 1.\n\nNow for other freeways, freeway 2 has only one car: (60,25,right,36), so [25,60] at t1.\n\nFreeways 3 to 8 all have two cars each: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6) for each.\n\nFor (-6,-17,right,6), head=-6, tail=-17, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-17, -6] for right-moving.\n\nAnd (42,31,right,6), head=42, tail=31, so [31,42].\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving.\n\nt1=7.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn t=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nSo at each turn, when you choose an action, you move at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nLet's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action a_t.\n\nSo at time t, you are at position y_t, you choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set, so you move to the new position at the start of next turn or something? The position is for the turn.\n\nI think it's like: at the beginning of turn t, you are at y_t. Then you take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T: if at turn T, you are on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nSpan(T) is the car's position at time T.\n\nSince you are at y_t during turn t, I think.\n\nThe note clarifies: if at turn T, you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so you only care about cars on y_T at time T for collision at time T.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at y_{T+1} at time T+1, you care about cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nSo for each turn, the position y_t determines which freeway you are on, and collision if 0 in car span on that row at that time.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 at t=7 to y=9 at some turn T.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=7 to t=7+H-1, actions from a7 to a_{7+H-2}, and position at t=7+H-1 is y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn index.\n\nStart: turn 7, position y=2.\n\nAfter action a7, at turn 8, position y8 = y7 + Δy7, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nI need y_{7+H-1} = 9, with actions from a7 to a_{7+H-2}.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nSo action at time t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nPosition at time t1 + t is before action, I think.\n\nAt time t, position y_t, then action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, collision depends on y_t and cars at time t.\n\nFor the player, at start of turn t, position y_t, then take action a_t, move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nDuring turn t, position is y_t, so collision check for y_t at time t.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\ny=0 is also safe, but I start at y=2, need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be just going up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid cars on the rows.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, and I need to be at x=0 when on a freeway row, without 0 in car span.\n\nx=0 is the position we care about.\n\nThe grid is vertical axis, but cars are on horizontal freeways, I think it's like the player moves vertically between rows, and cars move horizontally on each row.\n\nThe player is at (0, y), so fixed x=0, moving y.\n\nCars are on each y=k for k=1 to 8, moving left or right, but here all right-moving.\n\nFor each freeway, at each time, I need to know if there is a car such that 0 is in its span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nIf so, I cannot be on that row at that time.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nSo for each row and each time, I can compute if x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThen for the player path, for each time from t=7 onwards, the position y_t must not be on an occupied row at that time.\n\ny_t from 0 to 9, but occupied only for y=1 to 8 if car at x=0.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nI start at y=2 at t=7.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 asap.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay same y).\n\nBut y is bounded between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, since I need to go to y=9, and I'm at y=2, I probably want to go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway row and for each time t, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nt1 = 7.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span for right-moving car: [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nSince t1=7.\n\nLet me define τ_rel = τ, h_rel = h at t1=7.\n\nThen at time T, position: for right-moving, left end = τ + s(T-7), right end = h + s(T-7)\n\nx=0 is occupied if left end <= 0 <= right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for a car with tail τ, head h, speed s at t1, at time T, the span is [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)]\n\nx=0 in span if τ + s(T-7) <= 0 <= h + s(T-7)\n\nSince the car is moving right, and span is continuous, I assume.\n\nNow, for each row, I have multiple cars, so if any car has x=0 in span at time T, the row is occupied at T.\n\nOtherwise, free.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per row.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): cars:\n\n1. (h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=6) so at T, span: [-35 + 6(T-7), -24 + 6(T-7)]\n\n2. (h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6) span: [43 + 6(T-7), 54 + 6(T-7)]\n\n3. (h=18, τ=7, d=right, s=6) span: [7 + 6(T-7), 18 + 6(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): only one car: (h=60, τ=25, d=right, s=36) span: [25 + 36(T-7), 60 + 36(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nFirst: h=-6, τ=-17, span: [-17 + 6(T-7), -6 + 6(T-7)]\n\nSecond: h=42, τ=31, span: [31 + 6(T-7), 42 + 6(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 to 8, all same as freeway 3? No, freeway 4 to 8 also have two cars each, with the same parameters: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 3: (-6,-17,right,6), (42,31,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\n...\n\nUp to freeway 8: same.\n\nSo rows 3 to 8 are identical in terms of cars.\n\nRow 1 has different cars, row 2 has one car with high speed.\n\nRow 1 has three cars, row 2 has one, rows 3-8 have two each with same specs.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find when x=0 is occupied.\n\nThat is, for each T, and each row, if there exists a car such that τ + s(T-7) <= 0 <= h + s(T-7)\n\nSince s and τ,h known.\n\nT-7 is the time offset from now, let k = T - 7, so k >=0, k integer.\n\nFor time T, k = T-7.\n\nAt k=0, T=7.\n\nNow, for row y=1:\n\nCar1: span at k: [-35 + 6k, -24 + 6k]\n\nx=0 in span if -35 + 6k <= 0 <= -24 + 6k\n\nWhich is 6k <= 35 and 0 <= -24 + 6k so 24 <= 6k so k >= 4\n\nAnd 6k <= 35, k <= 35/6 = 5.833, so k <=5 since integer.\n\nSo k=4 or 5.\n\nFor k=4: -35 +24 = -11 <=0? -35+24= -11? -35 + 6*4 = -35+24= -11 <=0, and -24+24=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, so yes.\n\n-24 + 6*4 = -24+24=0, so 0 <=0, which is included, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly k=5: -35+30= -5 <=0, -24+30=6 >=0, so 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nk=6: -35+36=1 <=0? 1>0, so 0 not <=1? left end=1, right end=6, 1 to 6, 0<1, not in [1,6], so no.\n\nSimilarly k=3: -35+18= -17 <=0, -24+18= -6 <=0? -6 <=0 true, but 0 <= -6? 0 <= -6 false, since -6 <0, so 0 not <= -6, so not in span.\n\nThe condition is left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo for car1, left = -35+6k, right = -24+6k\n\n0 in [left, right] iff left <= 0 and 0 <= right.\n\nSo k=4: left=-11<=0, right=0<=0? 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nk=5: left=-5<=0, right=6>=0, yes.\n\nk=6: left=1>0, so left<=0 false, no.\n\nk=3: left=-17<=0, right=-6<0, so 0<=right false, no.\n\nSo occupied at k=4 and 5, i.e., T=11 and 12? T=7+k, k=4 T=11, k=5 T=12.\n\nT=7+k, k=0 is T=7.\n\nNow car2 on row1: (h=54,τ=43,s=6) span: [43 +6k, 54+6k]\n\nLeft=43+6k >=43>0, so left>0, so 0 < left, not <=0, so 0 never in span, since min left=43>0.\n\nSimilarly car3: (h=18,τ=7,s=6) span: [7+6k, 18+6k]\n\nLeft=7+6k >=7>0, so always >0, 0 never in span.\n\nSo for row1, only car1 can occupy x=0, at k=4 and 5, T=11 and 12.\n\nSo row1 occupied at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow row2, y=2: car (h=60,τ=25,s=36) span: [25 + 36k, 60 + 36k]\n\nLeft=25+36k >0 for all k>=0, so 0 never in span. Thus row2 is always free? But at T=7, k=0, span [25,60], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSince left min=25>0, so row2 is never occupied.\n\nGood, since I start at y=2, row2 is safe at all times.\n\nNow rows 3 to 8: each has two cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=-6, τ=-17, s=6) for right-moving, span: [τ + s k, h + s k] = [-17 + 6k, -6 + 6k]\n\nx=0 in span if -17+6k <=0 <= -6+6k\n\nSo -17+6k <=0 => 6k <=17 => k<=17/6≈2.833, k<=2\n\nAnd 0 <= -6+6k => 6k >=6 => k>=1\n\nSo k=1 or 2.\n\nFor k=1: left= -17+6= -11 <=0, right= -6+6=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nk=2: left= -17+12= -5 <=0, right= -6+12=6 >=0, yes.\n\nk=3: left= -17+18=1 >0, not <=0, no.\n\nk=0: right= -6 <0, 0<=right false, no.\n\nSo occupied at k=1,2 T=8,9.\n\nSecond car on these rows: (h=42, τ=31, s=6) span: [31+6k, 42+6k]\n\nLeft=31+6k >=31>0, so always >0, 0 never in span.\n\nSo for each of rows 3 to 8, occupied only at k=1 and 2, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nBecause only the first car can cover x=0 at those times.\n\nNow, summary of occupied rows per time:\n\nTime T | k=T-7 | Occupied rows (y=1 to 8)\n\nT=7, k=0: row1: not occ (since only at k=4,5), row2: never occ, rows3-8: at k=0, not occ (occ only k=1,2), so all rows free at T=7.\n\nT=8, k=1: row1: not occ (occ at k=4,5), row2: never occ, rows3-8: occ (at k=1), so y=3,4,5,6,7,8 occupied.\n\nT=9, k=2: similar, row1 not occ, row2 not occ, rows3-8 occ, so y=3 to 8 occupied.\n\nT=10, k=3: row1 not occ (k=3 not 4 or5), row2 not occ, rows3-8: not occ (k=3 not 1 or2), so all free.\n\nT=11, k=4: row1 occ (k=4), row2 not occ, rows3-8 not occ, so only y=1 occupied.\n\nT=12, k=5: row1 occ, others not, so only y=1 occ.\n\nT=13, k=6: row1 not occ (k=6>5), row2 not, rows3-8 not, all free.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, player at t=7, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, if I go up every turn, I can reach in 7 turns: start at t=7 y=2, after U at t=7, y=3 at t=8; U at t=8, y=4 at t=9; ... up to after U at t=13, y=9 at t=14?

Let's see.\n\nThe position after actions: at turn t1, start y_{t1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set for turn t1+1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? No.\n\nThe turn when we reach: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} , so actions at time t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nThen after action a_{t1 + H -1}, position at time t1 + H is set.\n\nBut we want position at time t1 + H -1 to be 9? Confusion.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nYes: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions are from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are taken from time t1 to time t1 + H -1, and they affect the position up to time t1 + H.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt time t1, position y_{t1}, take action a_{t1}, set y_{t1+1}\n\nAt time t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, take a_{t1+1}, set y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAt time t1 + H -2, position y_{t1 + H -2}, take a_{t1 + H -2}, set y_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAt time t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1}, take a_{t1 + H -1}, set y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at the start of turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t1 + H}, which may not be 9, but we don't care, as long as at t1 + H -1 it is 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t1 + H -1} is included, but since we are already at 9, we might do S or something, but it doesn't affect the position at t1 + H -1.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by previous actions.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, the actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} determine y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} is determined by actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nThen at time t1 + H -1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}=9, and we take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but that is after we have reached.\n\nThe sequence includes a_{t1 + H -1}, but it is not necessary for reaching, but since we must specify actions until we reach, I think we include it, but it can be arbitrary since we are already at 9.\n\nBut in this case, since we reach at turn t1 + H -1, and we take action at that turn, which might move us away, but the position at that turn is 9, so it's fine.\n\nFor minimal H, we need to arrive at some turn.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nI start at t=7, y=2.\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nMinimal T-7 or something.\n\nSince y=2 to y=9, min steps is 7, but with constraints.\n\nIn the direct path: go up every turn.\n\nt=7: y=2, which is row2, and at T=7, k=0, row2 is free, so safe.\n\nAction a7: U, then y8=3.\n\nt=8: y=3, which is row3, but at T=8, k=1, rows3-8 occupied, so y=3 is occupied at t=8, collision if I am there.\n\nSo at t=8, if I am at y=3, and row3 occupied, collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSpecifically at t=8 and t=9, rows 3-8 are occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3 to 8 at time t=8 or t=9.\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=2, which is safe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=3-8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Stay at y=2 for t=8 and/or t=9.\n\n- Go down to y=1 or y=0, but y=0 is safe.\n\ny=1 is occupied only at t=11 and 12, but at t=8 and 9, y=1 is free.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 always safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, I cannot be on y=3-8, I must be on y=0,1,2 at those times.\n\ny=2 is row2, which is always free, so I can stay or move.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should not delay unnecessarily.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9 is? If no constraints, t=14 as before, but with constraints at t=8,9.\n\nAfter t=9, from t=10 onwards, all rows are free except t=11 and 12 only y=1 occupied.\n\nt=10: all free, t=11: y=1 occ, t=12: y=1 occ, t=13: all free, etc.\n\nNow, from y=2 at t=7, I need to get to y=9.\n\nI can stay at y=2 for t=8 and t=9, then go up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nLet me list possible paths.\n\nFirst, if I go up immediately at t=7: a7=U, then y8=3.\n\nBut at t=8, y=3, occupied, collision. Not possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, to y=1 or y=0, but y=1 at t=8 is free, since occ only at t=11,12.\n\nt=8 k=1, row1 not occ.\n\nSimilarly y=0 safe.\n\nBut going down might not help to reach up.\n\nSince I have to avoid y=3-8 at t=8 and t=9, I must be at y<=2 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=0,1,2.\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=2.\n\nFor t=8, I can:\n\n- Stay: a7=S, then y8=2\n\n- Go down: a7=D, y8=1\n\n- Go up: but to y=3, which is occupied at t=8, not possible.\n\nSo only S or D at t=7.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=2\n\nThen at t=8, position y=2, safe.\n\nThen action a8: I need to set y9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9 must be <=2? Not necessarily, but at t=9, I cannot be on y=3-8, so y9 must be 0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, actions at t=8 set y9.\n\nSo at t=8, I am at y=2, I can:\n\n- S: y9=2\n\n- D: y9=1\n\n- U: y9=3, but at t=9, y=3 occupied, collision, not possible.\n\nSo only S or D at t=8.\n\nThus if I stay at y=2 for both, a7=S, then a8=S, y9=2 at t=9.\n\nThen from there, I can start going up.\n\nt=9, y=2.\n\nThen a9: U, to y10=3\n\nNow t=10, k=3, all rows free, so y=3 safe.\n\na10: U, y11=4\n\nt=11, k=4, y=4 is row4, which is free? Rows3-8 not occ at k=4, only row1 occ, so y=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly, a11: U, y12=5\n\nt=12, k=5, row5 free, only row1 occ.\n\na12: U, y13=6\n\nt=13, k=6, all free.\n\na13: U, y14=7? y13=6, U to y14=7\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\ny13=6 at t=13.\n\nThen a13: U, y14=7\n\na14: U, y15=8\n\na15: U, y16=9\n\nSo at t=16, y=9.\n\nt= t1 + H -1 =7 + H -1 =16, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a7 to a15? Let's list.\n\nt=7: y=2, action a7=S (say), y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, action a8=S, y9=2\n\nt=9: y=2, action a9=U, y10=3\n\nt=10: y=3, action a10=U, y11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, action a11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, action a12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, action a13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, action a14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, action a15=U, y16=9\n\nAt t=16, y=9, so we reached at turn t=16.\n\nH such that t1 + H -1 =16, t1=7, so 7 + H -1 =16, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a7 to a15, which is 9 actions? t=0 to H-1=9, actions at t=7 to 15.\n\nBut we reach at t=16, which is t1 + H -1? t1 + H -1 =7+10-1=16, yes.\n\nBut I used two S at beginning, so it took longer.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nInstead of staying at y=2, I could go down to y=1 or y=0 to perhaps start from lower and go up faster, but since I need to go to 9, going down might not help.\n\nAt t=7, I can go down to y=1.\n\na7=D, then y8=1\n\nt=8: y=1, which is row1, at T=8 k=1, row1 not occupied (occ only at k=4,5 T=11,12), so safe.\n\nThen at t=8, action a8: I need to set y9.\n\ny9 must be 0,1,2 since cannot be 3-8 at t=9.\n\nOptions:\n\n- S: y9=1\n\n- D: y9=0 (since y=1, D to y=0)\n\n- U: y9=2\n\nAll possible since y=1,2,0 all safe at t=9? t=9 y=1: row1, at T=9 k=2, row1 not occ, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=0,2 safe.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at t=9, then same as before.\n\nOr stay at y=1, or go to y=0.\n\nBut then from there I still need to go up to 9.\n\nFor example, a7=D, y8=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen from t=9 y=1, start going up.\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\nBut y10=2 at t=10, which is fine.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=3\n\nt=11, y=3, row3, at T=11 k=4, rows3-8 free, only row1 occ, so y=3 safe.\n\nThen continue up: a11=U, y12=4\n\nt=12, y=4 safe\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nAt t=17, y=9, worse than before.\n\nIf from y=1 at t=9, go directly up: but y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps, from t=9 to t=17, same.\n\nAfter a7=D, y8=1, then a8=U to y9=2, then same as first path where I was at y=2 at t=9.\n\nIn the first path with stay, I had y9=2 at t=9.\n\nSame as here if I go to y=2 at t=9.\n\nBut I can be at y=0 or something, but not helpful.\n\nNow, to reach faster, I need to be higher when the rows are free.\n\nAt t=10, all free, and t=11,12 only y=1 occ, so y=2-8 are safe except y=1 at t=11,12.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, I must be at y<=2, I cannot be higher than 2 at those times.\n\nThen at t=10, I can be at y=3,4,etc.\n\nThe minimal time to reach y=9 from y=2 with constraints.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=7, after t=9, I can start moving up.\n\nAt t=9, I am at y=2 (if I stayed or moved to 2).\n\nThen from t=9 to t=10, go to y=3.\n\nt=10 to t=11, to y=4, and so on.\n\nEach step up, reach y=9 at t=16 as before.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at a higher y at t=10.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I am stuck at y<=2, so at t=9, y<=2.\n\nThen at t=10, max y=3 (if I go up from y=2).\n\nThen t=11, y=4, ..., up to t=16 y=9.\n\ny=9 at t=16.\n\nBut t=16 is t1 + H -1 =7 + H -1, so if H=10, t=16.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after t=9, but I can only move one step per turn, so it takes 7 steps from y=2 to y=9, from t=9 to t=16.\n\nt=9 y=2, t=10 y=3, t=11 y=4, t=12 y=5, t=13 y=6, t=14 y=7, t=15 y=8, t=16 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=11 and t=12, rows 3-8 are free, only y=1 occupied, so moving up through y=3 to 8 is fine.\n\nNow, is there a way to be at a higher position earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=7, if I could go up, but I can't because at t=8 y=3 occupied.\n\nWhat if I go to y=0 or something, but that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=2 for only one turn, not two.\n\nBut at t=8, I must not be on y=3-8, and at t=9 same.\n\nSo I have to be <=2 at both t=8 and t=9.\n\nIf at t=7, I go down to y=1, then at t=8 y=1, still <=2.\n\nThen at t=8, if I go up to y=2, then at t=9 y=2.\n\nSame as staying.\n\nAt t=8, I could go down to y=0, but then at t=9 y=0, which is lower, worse.\n\nSo I think I have to spend t=8 and t=9 at y<=2.\n\nThus the earliest to start going up is from t=9 onwards from y<=2.\n\nSo minimal to reach y=9 is at t=16, with H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify actions from a7 to a15, with y16=9.\n\nIn the action list, for turn t1 + H -1 = t=15, I take action a15 which sets y16=9, so at t=16 position is 9.\n\nNow, but in this path, I used S at t=7 and t=8, but I could use other actions, but the time is the same.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I go to y=9 directly after the danger.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=10,11,12,13 all rows except y=1 at 11,12 are free, and y=9 is always free, but I need to get to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=9, it takes 7 moves to y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=10, I can be at y=3, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can be at a higher y at t=10 if I move during the danger, but I cannot because I have to stay low.\n\nUnless I go to y=0 or something, but no.\n\nWhat if at t=7, I go down to y=1, then at t=8, I stay at y=1, then at t=9, instead of going to y=2, I go up to y=2 only later, but that delays.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that at t=10, I can move multiple steps, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother thought: after t=9, from t=10 onwards, I can go up faster, but I still need one turn per level.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I can't.\n\nMinimal number of turns from y=2 to y=9 is 7, but I have to wait for 2 turns (t=8 and t=9) where I cannot progress, so minimal H should be 7 + 2 =9? But in terms of turns.\n\nI start at t=7 y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe waiting turns: at t=8 and t=9, I must be at y<=2, so I cannot increase y during these turns.\n\nThus, the y increase can only happen after t=9.\n\nFrom t=10 onwards, I can increase y.\n\nEach increase takes one turn.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, need 7 increases.\n\nSo first increase at t=10 to y=3, then t=11 y=4, ..., t=16 y=9.\n\nSo t=16.\n\nThe actions: from t=7 to t=15, 9 actions, H=10 turns including start? H is the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=7, turns 7 to 7+H-1.\n\nPosition at 7+H-1 is y=9.\n\nSo 7+H-1=16, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at t=7 to t=15.\n\nNow, for t=7 and t=8, I need to set y8 and y9 to <=2.\n\nAt t=7, y=2, I can do S or D.\n\nSimilarly at t=8, S or D to keep y<=2.\n\nIn the sequence, I can choose, for example, all S, or mix with D, but to minimize, S is fine.\n\nBut at t=9, I need to be at y<=2 to start going up.\n\nIn the path above, at t=9 y=2.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the collision.\n\nAt t=7: y=2, row2 always free, safe.\n\na7=S, y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, safe.\n\na8=S, y9=2\n\nt=9: y=2, safe (row2 free)\n\na9=U, y10=3\n\nt=10: y=3, row3, at T=10 k=3, rows3-8 free, safe.\n\na10=U, y11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, row4, at T=11 k=4, rows3-8 free, only row1 occ, so safe.\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe similarly.\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, k=6, all free, safe.\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, safe.\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, row8, at T=15, k=8, all rows free since occ only specific times, so safe.\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nAt t=16, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, is there a faster way?\n\nSuppose at t=7, I go down to y=1: a7=D, y8=1\n\nt=8: y=1, row1, at T=8 k=1, row1 not occ (occ at k=4,5), so safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I could go down to y=0: a8=D, y9=0\n\nt=9: y=0, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=1\n\nBut y10=1 at t=10, which is row1, at T=10 k=3, row1 not occ, safe.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, safe\n\na11=U, y12=3\n\nAnd so on, up to y=9 later, at t=17 or something, worse.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=9, to y=9, need 9 steps, from t=9 to t=18, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=8, from y=1, I can go up to y=2: a8=U, y9=2, same as before.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=10, but let's see if I can reach before t=16.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=3 at t=10, but I can, as above.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=10 to y=9 at t=16, that's 6 turns, y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps, t=10 to t=16? t=10 y=3, t=11 y=4, ..., t=15 y=8, t=16 y=9, yes.\n\nCan I be at y=4 at t=10? But at t=10, to be at y=4, I must have been at y=4 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=9, I must be at y<=2, so at t=10, after action from t=9, y10 = y9 + Δy9.\n\nIf y9 <=2, then y10 <=3, so max y10=3, cannot be 4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be higher than 3 at t=10.\n\nThus, indeed, y=3 at t=10 is the highest possible.\n\nThen proceed to y=9 at t=16.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after, but no, one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=11 and t=12, y=1 is occupied, but I am not on y=1, so no problem.\n\nIn the path, I go through y=3 to 8 during t=11 and 12, but they are free, so fine.\n\nIs there a way to jump or something? No.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the sequence.\n\nt1=7.\n\nH=10.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=7+10-1=16? Actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, t from 0 to 9, so actions at time t1=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.\n\nThat is 10 actions: a7 to a16? t=0: a7, t=1: a8, ..., t=9: a16.\n\nThen position at time t1 + H =7+10=17? But we want position at turn t1 + H -1=7+10-1=16 to be 9.\n\nWith actions up to a16, which sets y17.\n\nBut y16 is set by actions up to a15.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe actions are taken at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAction at time t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\n- Action a_{t1} at time t1 sets y_{t1+1}\n\n- Action a_{t1+1} at time t1+1 sets y_{t1+2}\n\n- ...\n\n- Action a_{t1+H-1} at time t1+H-1 sets y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by action a_{t1 + H -2} at time t1 + H -2.\n\nThen at time t1 + H -1, position is 9, and we take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care about that position.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t1 + H -1}, which can be anything, say S.\n\nIn this case, for H=10, t1=7, t1 + H -1 =7+10-1=16, so y16=9.\n\ny16 is set by a15 at time 15.\n\nActions: from a7 to a15? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: action at time t1 +0 =7, sets y8\n\nt=1: action at time 8, sets y9\n\nt=2: action at time 9, sets y10\n\n...\n\nt=8: action at time 7+8=15, sets y16\n\nt=9: action at time 7+9=16, sets y17\n\nBut we want y16=9, which is set by action at time 15, which is t=8 in the sequence.\n\nFor y_{t1 + H -1} = y16 to be 9, it is set by a_{t1 + H -2} = a_{15} at time 15.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAction at time t1+H-1 sets y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} is set by a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need the actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2} to achieve that, and a_{t1+H-1} can be arbitrary.\n\nBut in the sequence, we must specify a_{t1+H-1} as well.\n\nFor minimal H, we can choose a_{t1+H-1} to be S or whatever.\n\nIn this path, with H=10, y16=9.\n\nActions: a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16\n\nBut a7 to a15 set y8 to y16, and a16 sets y17.\n\nWe want y16=9, which is set by a15? Action at time t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo action at time 15 sets y16.\n\nSimilarly, action at time 16 sets y17.\n\nFor y16 to be 9, action at time 15 must set it.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to 9, actions at time 7 to 16.\n\nAction at time 15 (t=8) sets y16.\n\nAction at time 16 (t=9) sets y17.\n\nNow, in the path, to have y16=9, we need the actions up to a15.\n\nBut a16 is extra.\n\nIn the sequence, we can set a16 to S, for example.\n\nBut in terms of reaching at turn 16, it is fine.\n\nNow back to the actions.\n\nIn my path, at time 7: action S or D, but to be efficient, S to stay.\n\nSimilarly at time 8: S.\n\nBut at time 9: U to go to y10=3.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify.\n\nBut at time 7, I could do nothing, but action must be U,D,S.\n\nNow, another thing: at t=11 and 12, y=1 is occupied, but since I am not going there, fine.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier than t=16?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=4 at t=10, but as before, impossible because at t=9 I must be <=2.\n\nUnless I can be at y=4 at t=10 by moving faster, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly from below, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=10,11,12,13 all good except y=1 occ at 11,12, but I can be on y=9 earlier if I start higher.\n\nBut I cannot.\n\nMinimal time is t=16.\n\nBut let's list the occupied times again to see.\n\nOccupied:\n\nt=8: rows 3-8 occ\n\nt=9: rows 3-8 occ\n\nt=11: row1 occ\n\nt=12: row1 occ\n\nOther times all free.\n\nPlayer at t=7: y=2\n\nTo reach y=9.\n\nThe constraint is that at t=8 and t=9, y must not be in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, so must be in {0,1,2}.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11 and t=12, y must not be 1, but since I am going up, y=1 is low, I might not be there.\n\nIn the path, I am at y=4 at t=11, which is fine.\n\nNow, suppose I want to reach at t=15, y15=9.\n\ny15=9.\n\nBut y15 is set by a14 at time 14.\n\nNow, at time 14, position y14, action a14 sets y15.\n\nIf y15=9, then y14 must be 8 or 9, and a14=U or S.\n\nBut y15=9.\n\nNow, trace back.\n\nAt t=7, y=2.\n\nAfter 8 turns? From t=7 to t=15, 8 turns later, but positions.\n\nt=7: y=2\n\nt=8: y must be <=2\n\nt=9: y must be <=2\n\nt=10: y10\n\nt=11: y11\n\nt=12: y12\n\nt=13: y13\n\nt=14: y14\n\nt=15: y15=9\n\ny15=9, so y14 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y14=8, a14=U\n\nIf y14=9, a14=S\n\nNow, y14 at t=14.\n\nt=14, k=7, all free, no issue.\n\nBut to have y14=8 or 9, need to be high earlier.\n\ny13 determines y14.\n\ny13 can be 7,8,9.\n\nBut at t=13, y13, k=6, all free.\n\nNow, similarly, back to t=10.\n\ny10 at t=10, must be integer.\n\nSince at t=9 y<=2, and at t=10 y10 = y9 + Δy9 <= 2 +1 =3 if U, or less.\n\nSo y10 <=3.\n\nThen at t=11, y11 = y10 + Δy10 <=3+1=4\n\nt=12, y12 <=5\n\nt=13, y13 <=6\n\nt=14, y14 <=7\n\nThen y15 <=8\n\nBut we want y15=9, so y15 <=8 max, contradiction.\n\ny15 <=8, but we need y15=9, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot reach at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, y14 <=7 as above, but y14=9 needed? No, for t=15 reach.\n\nBut y14 <=7, so y15 <=8 <9, cannot be 9 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, y14 <=7, so cannot be 9.\n\nEarliest possible: at t=10, y10 <=3\n\nt=11, y11 <=4\n\nt=12, y12 <=5\n\nt=13, y13 <=6\n\nt=14, y14 <=7\n\nt=15, y15 <=8\n\nt=16, y16 <=9, and can be 9 if y15=8 and a15=U.\n\nSo t=16 is indeed the earliest.\n\nThus H=10.\n\nNow for the actions, I need to specify the sequence.\n\nIn the path, I can choose actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt time 7: action S, so y8=2\n\nTime 8: action S, y9=2\n\nTime 9: action U, y10=3\n\nTime 10: action U, y11=4\n\nTime 11: action U, y12=5\n\nTime 12: action U, y13=6\n\nTime 13: action U, y14=7\n\nTime 14: action U, y15=8\n\nTime 15: action U, y16=9\n\nNow, at time 16, we need to specify action, but since we reached at turn 16, action at time 16 can be S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from time 7 to 16.\n\nFor time 16, action a16, which sets y17, but not relevant.\n\nSo for example, a16=S.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list for each turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t from 0 to 9, actions at time 7 to 16.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the occupied, at t=11 and 12, y=1 is occupied, but in this path, I am at y=4 and y=5, not on y=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTo make it consistent, I can do this.\n\nSince row2 is always free, I can stay there during danger.\n\nNow, for the action at time 16, I can set it to S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it must be included.\n\nNow, about the cars: in row1, there is a car that occupies at t=11 and 12, but I am not on row1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about going down, but it doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly after t=9, but I have to climb.\n\nAnother thought: since y=9 is free, if I can be at y=9 at t=10, but impossible from y<=2 at t=9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nH=10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S  (since we reached at turn 16, action at 16 can be stay)\n\nAt turn 16, position y=9, we take action, say S, to stay at y=9 for next, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, it must be specified.\n\nTo save action, but H is fixed.\n\nSince we reach at turn t=16, and action at t=16 is after, we can choose any.\n\nBut in this case, with a15=U at time 15, we set y16=9.\n\nThen at time 16, we take a16, which can be S.\n\nIn the sequence for turns.\n\nNow, but let's list the turns from t=7 to t=16 for actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, there is a car that occupies at t=11 and 12, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier if I go to a safe row.\n\nBut during t=8 and t=9, no safe row above 2 except y=0 and 1, but lower.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=8 and 9, but it doesn't help to go up.\n\nFor example, at t=7, go to y=1: a7=D, y8=1\n\nThen at t=8, I can stay, y9=1\n\nThen at t=9, go to y=2: a9=U? But at t=9, I can be on y=2, and action at t=9 sets y10.\n\nIf a9=U, y10=3, same as before.\n\nIf at t=8, from y=1, I go up to y=2: a8=U, y9=2, same.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think H=10 is the minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to achieve the goal in \\(H = 10\\) turns. This sequence ensures that the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 7 + 10 - 1 = 16\\).\n\nThe car positions and collision conditions were analyzed for each turn from \\(t = 7\\) onwards. Key observations:\n- At turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\), freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are occupied by cars, so the player must avoid these rows during these turns.\n- At turns \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\), freeway \\(y = 1\\) is occupied, but this does not affect the player in the chosen path.\n- Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is always safe, allowing the player to stay there during dangerous turns.\n- From \\(t = 10\\) onwards, all freeways except \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\) are free, enabling upward movement.\n\nThe minimal path involves:\n- Staying at \\(y = 2\\) for turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) to avoid collisions.\n- Moving upward from \\(y = 2\\) starting at \\(t = 9\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(t = 16\\).\n\nAction sequence:\n- Actions are taken from turn \\(7\\) to turn \\(16\\) (i.e., \\(a_7\\) to \\(a_{16}\\)).\n- At turn \\(16\\), the player is at \\((0, 9)\\), and the action \\(S\\) is chosen to stay, but any action is valid since the goal is already achieved at the start of turn \\(16\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n```\n\nThis sequence results in the following positions:\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, no cars at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, no cars at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 2\\) (action \\(U\\) sets \\(y_{10} = 3\\))\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeways clear)\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) clear except \\(y = 1\\) occupied but player not on it)\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, similar to turn 11)\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, all freeways clear)\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, all freeways clear)\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 8\\) (action \\(U\\) sets \\(y_{16} = 9\\))\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, safe)\n\nNo collisions occur, as the player avoids occupied rows at critical turns. \\(H = 10\\) is minimal, as reaching \\(y = 9\\) before turn 16 is impossible due to the constraints at turns \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) limiting the player to \\(y \\leq 2\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 7: S} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 8: S} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 9: U} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 10: U} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 11: U} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 12: U} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 13: U} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 14: U} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 15: U} } \\\\\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 16: S} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=8, and I have the car states for each freeway.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, since direction is \"right\" for all. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], where h and τ are given at t₁=8.\n\nLooking at the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd collision occurs if at turn T, y_T is the freeway you're on, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nAlso important: when you move, you're not on the new row until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on row y, and you move to y+1, at turn T you're still on row y for collision purposes, and you only occupy row y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position update: at each turn, you choose an action: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), which changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=2 at t=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above, but freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8 with cars. y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones with no cars.\n\nSo I need to get to (0,9).\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns H: since I need to go from y=2 to y=9, that's 7 steps up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut I should aim to go up as much as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number. Current t₁=8.\n\nSo for any future turn T (T >= 8), the car spans on freeway k.\n\nBut since I'm at y=2 now, I need to consider when I move to other rows.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\nFirst car: h=-18, τ=-29, d=right, s=6\n\nSince right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] = [-29 + 6(T-8), -18 + 6(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=6, span [49 + 6(T-8), 60 + 6(T-8)]\n\nThird car: h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=6, span [13 + 6(T-8), 24 + 6(T-8)]\n\nBut τ and h: for right-moving, τ is tail, h is head? Let's see the span definition.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for right-moving, at t₁, span is [τ, h], so τ should be left, h right, so τ < h.\n\nIn the first car on freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 6), but -18 and -29, -29 is less than -18? -29 is smaller, so if τ is tail, and for right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so if moving right, tail at left end.\n\nIn this case, h=-18, τ=-29, and -29 < -18, so [τ, h] = [-29, -18] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49,right,6), τ=49, h=60, 49<60, so [49,60].\n\nThird: (24,13,right,6), τ=13, h=24, [13,24].\n\nNow for freeway 2: only one car: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nh=-48, τ=-83, -83 < -48, so span at T: [ -83 + 36(T-8), -48 + 36(T-8) ]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (0, -11, right, 6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=0, τ=-11, so [-11,0] at t=8? Span at t₁ is [τ, h] for right, so [ -11, 0 ] at t=8.\n\nBut collision occurs if 0 is in span, and at t=8 on freeway 3, 0 is in [-11,0], since -11 <= 0 <= 0? 0 is the upper end.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=48, τ=37, [37,48] at t=8.\n\nNow freeway 4 to 8: all have the same cars as freeway 3: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4,5,6,7,8 all have identical cars: one car with [ -11, 0 ] at t=8, and another with [37,48] at t=8, both speed 6, right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1 has different cars, freeway 2 has one car, freeway 3 same as 4-8? Freeway 3 has (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6), same as others.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, freeway 2 has one, freeway 3 to 8 have two each, all right-moving speed 6 except freeway 2 speed 36.\n\nFreeway 2 has speed 36, which is fast.\n\nNow, I need to find when it's safe to be on each row at each turn.\n\nBut since I start at y=2 at t=8, and I need to go up to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut I have to traverse through y=3 to y=8.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time T, whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I am on row k, and 0 is in the span of a car on freeway k.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, I think, always, since position is (0, y), so we care about x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and each time T, we need to know if there is a car on k such that 0 is in [left, right] of its span at T.\n\nFor freeway k, at time T, if min_span <= 0 <= max_span for some car.\n\nSince spans are intervals.\n\nNow, let's define the time relative to t=8.\n\nSet Δt = T - 8, so at Δt=0, current time.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1)\n\nCars:\n\n1. [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-29 + 6 Δt, -18 + 6 Δt]\n\n2. [49 + 6 Δt, 60 + 6 Δt]\n\n3. [13 + 6 Δt, 24 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 is in span if for some car, left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo for car 1: -29 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -18 + 6Δt\n\nWhich is -29 + 6Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -18 + 6Δt\n\nSo 6Δt <= 29 and 6Δt >= 18? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-29 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 29 => Δt <= 29/6 = 4.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -18 + 6Δt => 6Δt >= 18 => Δt >= 3\n\nSo for car 1, 0 in span when 3 <= Δt <= 4.833, since Δt integer, Δt=3,4\n\nSimilarly, car 2: 49 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 60 + 6Δt? 49 + 6Δt <= 0? 49 + 6Δt is always positive for Δt >=0, since min at Δt=0 is 49>0, so 49+6Δt >=49>0, so 0 <= 49+6Δt is true but 49+6Δt <=0 is false, so 0 cannot be <= left since left >=49>0, so 0 never in span for car 2.\n\nSimilarly, car 3: 13 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 6Δt\n\n13+6Δt <=0? 13+6Δt >=13>0, so never <=0, thus 0 never in span.\n\nSo on freeway 1, only car 1 can have 0 in span, for Δt=3 and 4.\n\nAt Δt=3: left = -29+18= -11, right= -18+18=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=4: left= -29+24= -5, right= -18+24=6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=5: left= -29+30=1, right= -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at Δt=3,4 for freeway 1.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2)\n\nOne car: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-83 + 36 Δt, -48 + 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nWhich is -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nFirst: -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 36 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo for integer Δt, Δt=2 only? Since at Δt=2: 36*2=72, left= -83+72= -11, right= -48+72=24, [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=1: left= -83+36= -47, right= -48+36= -12? -48+36= -12, and -83+36= -47, so [-47,-12], 0 not in, since all negative.\n\nAt Δt=0: [-83,-48], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3: left= -83+108=25, right= -48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only unsafe at Δt=2 for freeway 2.\n\nΔt=2, which is T= t₁ +2 =10.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3)\n\nCars: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=0, τ=-11, so at t₁, span [τ, h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 6 Δt, 0 + 6 Δt] = [-11 + 6 Δt, 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 6 Δt\n\nWhich is -11 + 6 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 6 Δt\n\nFirst: 6 Δt <= 11? -11 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6 Δt always true for Δt >=0 except Δt=0? At Δt=0, 6*0=0, so 0 <=0 true, but let's see.\n\n0 <= 6 Δt is true for Δt >=0, since 6Δt >=0.\n\nAnd -11 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <=11 => Δt <= 1.833\n\nSo for integer Δt, Δt=0,1\n\nAt Δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 <=0 <=0, yes.\n\nAt Δt=1: left= -11+6= -5, right=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=2: left= -11+12=1, right=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow second car: [37 + 6 Δt, 48 + 6 Δt], both >=37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo on freeway 3, unsafe at Δt=0 and Δt=1.\n\nΔt=0 is now, t=8.\n\nBut I am at y=2 now, not on y=3, so at t=8, I am on y=2.\n\nNow for freeway 4 to 8, all same as freeway 3, since identical cars.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, cars same: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6), so same as freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, etc.\n\nFreeway k for k=1 to 8 correspond to y=k.\n\nSo for each of freeway 3 to 8 (y=3 to 8), at time T, unsafe when Δt=0 or 1.\n\nThat is, at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8: Δt=0, unsafe for y=3 to 8.\n\nt=9: Δt=1, unsafe for y=3 to 8.\n\nNow, for freeway 1 (y=1), unsafe at Δt=3,4 i.e. t=11,12\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2), unsafe only at Δt=2, t=10\n\nI am at y=2 at t=8.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T, when I am on row y_T, it must not be unsafe at that time.\n\nNow, I start at t=8, y=2.\n\nAt t=8, y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nIs it unsafe? For freeway 2, unsafe at Δt=2, which is t=10, not now.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=0, for freeway 2, car span [-83,-48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, Δt=1, freeway 2: span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nOnly unsafe at t=10.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\ny=9 is row 9, which is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nBut to get there, I need to pass through y=3 to y=8.\n\ny=3 to y=8 are unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8 and t=9, all rows y=3 to 8 are unsafe.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=0, y=3-8 unsafe.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=1, y=3-8 unsafe.\n\nAt t=10, Δt=2, what about y=3-8?\n\nFor y=3 to 8, unsafe only when Δt=0 or 1, so at Δt=2, safe.\n\nFor example, y=3: at Δt=2, as above, span for first car [1,12], 0 not in, second car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for y=1 and y=2, we have specific unsafe times.\n\nBut y=1 is below, I don't need to go there.\n\nNow, I am at y=2 at t=8, safe.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=3 to y=8 are unsafe at t=8 and t=9, I cannot be on those rows at those times.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=3 is at t=10 or later.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, let me list the safety per row per time.\n\nTimes: t=8,9,10,11,12,...\n\nRows: y=1 to 8 are freeways, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nBut I start at y=2, target y=9.\n\nNow, for each row and time, safe or not.\n\nMake a table.\n\nFirst, y=1: unsafe at t=11,12 (Δt=3,4)\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=10 (Δt=2)\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=8,9 (Δt=0,1)\n\ny=4: same as y=3, unsafe at t=8,9\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at t=8,9\n\nAt t=10 and later, y=3 to 8 are safe, as we saw.\n\ny=3 to 8 safe at t=10,11,12,... except for y=1 and y=2 which have later unsafe times, but I don't care about y=1.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at t=10.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=2 at t=8 to y=9.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, I cannot go to y=3-8, I should stay or go down, but going down to y=1 might not help, or stay at y=2.\n\ny=2 is safe at t=8 and t=9, as we said.\n\nAt t=8: safe\n\nt=9: safe\n\nt=10: unsafe, so I cannot be on y=2 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to y=3 at t=10 or later.\n\nNow, the minimal H: I need to increase y from 2 to 9, difference 7.\n\nBut I have to spend some turns waiting or avoiding.\n\nAt t=8, I am at y=2.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at t=9? Let's see the timeline.\n\nAt turn T, I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition at turn t is given, then I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nStart: at turn t=8, position (0,2)\n\nI choose a_8, which sets y_9.\n\nThen at turn t=9, I am at y_9, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars on freeway y_T.\n\nNow, at t=8, I am on y=2, which is safe, as established.\n\nNow, I choose a_8.\n\nOptions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_9 = y_8 +1 = 3.\n\nThen at turn t=9, I am on y=3.\n\nBut at t=9, y=3 is unsafe, since freeway 3 unsafe at Δt=1 (t=9).\n\nSo collision.\n\nCannot go up to y=3 at t=9.\n\nIf I choose D, y_9 = y_8 -1 =1.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=1.\n\ny=1 at t=9: Δt=1, for freeway 1.\n\nEarlier, freeway 1 unsafe only at Δt=3,4, t=11,12.\n\nAt Δt=1, t=9: freeway 1 cars: car1 left= -29+6= -23, right= -18+6= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66], no.\n\nCar3: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30], no. So safe at t=9.\n\nBut y=1 is row 1, which is a freeway, but safe at t=9.\n\nThen I would be at y=1 at t=9.\n\nBut I need to go up to y=9, so going down might not be efficient.\n\nIf I choose S, y_9 = y_8 =2.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=2, which is safe, as before.\n\nSo at t=8, I can choose S or D, but not U.\n\nChoosing D to y=1 might be worse, since I have to come back up.\n\nProbably better to stay or go down only if necessary.\n\nBut let's see the future.\n\nAt t=9, if I am at y=2 (after S at t=8), then I choose a_9.\n\nIf I go up, y_10 =3, but at t=10, I would be on y=3 at turn t=10.\n\nt=10, Δt=2.\n\ny=3 at t=10: Δt=2, safe, as earlier.\n\nThen I can be on y=3 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if I am at y=2, I could go down to y=1, but not necessary.\n\nOr stay.\n\nBut at t=10, y=2 is unsafe, so I cannot stay at y=2 for t=10.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t=10, if I am on y=2, it is unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2 at t=10.\n\nTherefore, at t=9, if I am at y=2, I must not choose S, because if S, y_10=2, then at t=10 on y=2, collision.\n\nI must choose U or D.\n\nIf U, y_10=3, then at t=10 on y=3, which is safe.\n\nIf D, y_10=1, then at t=10 on y=1, which at t=10, Δt=2, freeway 1: car1 left= -29+12= -17, right= -18+12= -6? -18+12= -6, and -29+12= -17, so [-17,-6], 0 not in; other cars no, so safe.\n\nBut going down to y=1 might delay.\n\nSo better to go up to y=3 at t=10.\n\nNow, back to t=8.\n\nAt t=8, I should choose S or D.\n\nIf I choose S, then at t=9, y=2.\n\nThen at t=9, I choose U, so y_10=3, at t=10 on y=3.\n\nIf I choose D at t=8, y_9=1, at t=9 on y=1.\n\nThen at t=9, I can choose U, so y_10=2, but at t=10, y=2 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=2 at t=10.\n\nIf at t=9 I am on y=1, and I choose U, y_10=2, then at t=10 on y=2, collision.\n\nIf I choose S, y_10=1, stay on y=1.\n\nThen at t=10 on y=1, safe as above.\n\nBut then I need to go up later.\n\nWorse than staying at y=2 and going up.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2 for t=8 and t=9, then go up at t=9 to y=3 for t=10.\n\nAt t=8: choose S, so y_9=2.\n\nAt t=9: choose U, so y_10=3.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=3, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3 to y=8 are all safe at t=10 and later, since unsafe only at t=8,9.\n\nt=10 is Δt=2, safe for all.\n\nSimilarly t=11,12, etc., but for y=1 and y=2 there are unsafe times, but I don't care.\n\ny=3 to y=8 safe for t>=10.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=10, I can go up each turn.\n\nSince no obstacles above, and all safe.\n\ny=4 to y=8 are freeways, but safe at t=10+.\n\nSo I can go up directly.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=10, to y=9, I need 6 moves: to y=4 at t=11, y=5 at t=12, ..., up to y=9 at t=15.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t=10, position y=3.\n\nChoose action at t=10 to go to y=4.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=4.\n\nChoose U, to y=5 at t=12, and so on.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=10: at y=3, choose U, so y_11=4\n\nThen at t=11, on y=4, choose U, y_12=5\n\nt=12, on y=5, U, y_13=6\n\nt=13, on y=6, U, y_14=7\n\nt=14, on y=7, U, y_15=8\n\nt=15, on y=8, U, y_16=9\n\nThen at t=16, on y=9, which is safe, and I have reached.\n\nBut at t=16, y=9, which is the target.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=8 to when I reach.\n\nI reach y=9 at turn t=16, when I am at (0,9).\n\nNow, the actions: from t=8 to t=15, I think.\n\nStart at t=8, y=2.\n\nAfter actions, I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H turns, I am at y=9.\n\nTurns from t=8 to t=8+H-1.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nI start at turn t=8, y=2.\n\nI perform actions at t=8, t=9, ..., up to some turn, and at that turn, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=16, y=9.\n\nBut let's see the path:\n\nt=8: y=2, choose action. We said choose S, so y_9=2\n\nt=9: y=2, choose U, so y_10=3\n\nt=10: y=3, choose U, so y_11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, choose U, so y_12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, choose U, so y_13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, choose U, so y_14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, choose U, so y_15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, choose U, so y_16=9\n\nAt t=16, y=9.\n\nNow, I took actions from t=8 to t=15, that's 8 actions, H=8 turns? Turns from t=8 to t=15 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn the path above, at turn t=16, y=9, which is t_1 + 8, since t_1=8, 8+8=16.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =16, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nI start at turn t=8.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=8, y=2.\n\nAfter first action at t=8, I go to y= something at t=9.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, I am at turn t=8+k.\n\nAt turn t=8, before any action, position given.\n\nI choose a_{t} for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nSo actions at time: t_1, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + H -1\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn (t_1 + H -1) + something? Let's see the position.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter choosing action at T, y_{T+1} is determined.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, y_{t_1} given.\n\nThen choose a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, choose a_{t_1 +1}, sets y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? No.\n\nThe turn when we are at (0,9) is turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, in my earlier path, I want at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=16, y=9.\n\nt=16 should be t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =16, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions at t=8 to t=8+8=16? t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=8 to t=16? t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince H=9, actions at t=8 to t=8+8=16? t_1 + t for t=0 to 8? t from 0 to H-1=8, so times t_1 +0 to t_1 +8, that is t=8 to t=16.\n\nBut at turn t=16, we choose action, but we should be at y=9 at turn t=16 before action? Confusion.\n\nStandard: at each turn, we are at a position, then we choose action for the next position.\n\nWe reach when at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, we choose a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn terms of position, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my path, I have y=9 at t=16.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =16, thus H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=16? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =8 to 8+8=16? t_1 + H -1 =8 +9 -1=16, yes.\n\nBut at turn t=16, we are at y=9, and we choose an action, but since we reached, the action might not matter, but we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=16, we choose an action, but since we are already at y=9, we can choose S or whatever, but to minimize, we stop when reached.\n\nThe action sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1 we are at (0,9).\n\nIn my case, with H=9, actions from t=8 to t=16? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =8 to 8+8=16? Indices: t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 8 (H-1=8), so times 8+0=8 to 8+8=16.\n\nBut at turn 16, if we are at y=9, it is fine.\n\nIn my path, at turn t=15, I was at y=8, and chose U to go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nSo at turn t=16, I am at y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in this path, I used 9 turns: actions at t=8 to t=16? Let's list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence I described:\n\nAt t=8: choose S, so y_9=2\n\nAt t=9: choose U, y_10=3\n\nAt t=10: choose U, y_11=4\n\nAt t=11: choose U, y_12=5\n\nAt t=12: choose U, y_13=6\n\nAt t=13: choose U, y_14=7\n\nAt t=14: choose U, y_15=8\n\nAt t=15: choose U, y_16=9\n\nThen at turn t=16, y=9.\n\nSo actions at t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. That's 8 actions.\n\nt=8 to t=15 inclusive, that's 8 turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, so H=8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =8 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn t=15, what is y? At t=15, y=8, not 9.\n\nAt turn t=15, after action, y_16=9, but position at turn t=15 is y=8.\n\nWe reach at turn t=16, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =16, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nBut actions at t=8 to t=16? For t=16, we choose action, but at turn t=16, we are at y=9, so if we choose an action, it might go to y=10 or something, but y=9 is max, so we can choose S or D, but since we reached, it should be fine.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=16, we need to choose an action, but we are already at y=9.\n\nTo avoid issue, perhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nIn my path, I have to wait at y=2 for two turns? At t=8 and t=9 I am at y=2.\n\nt=8: y=2, choose S\n\nt=9: y=2, choose U\n\nThen t=10: y=3\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=2, and I choose U, so for turn t=9, I am on y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=3, safe.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=8, instead of staying, can I go down or something to be able to go up earlier? Unlikely.\n\nAt t=8, if I choose D, go to y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=1, I can choose U to go to y=2 at t=10, but at t=10, y=2 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=2 at t=10.\n\nSo at t=9, on y=1, I must choose S or D, but not U, because U would put me on y=2 at t=10.\n\nIf I choose S, stay at y=1 for t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=1, safe? At t=10, Δt=2, freeway 1: as before, car1 [-17,-6], no 0; others no, so safe.\n\nThen at t=10, I can choose U to go to y=2 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, y=2: Δt=3, freeway 2: at Δt=3, span [-83+108, -48+108]=[25,60], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut this is slower: at t=8, D to y=1 at t=9.\n\nt=9: S or D, say S to stay y=1 at t=10.\n\nt=10: U to y=2 at t=11.\n\nt=11: at y=2, then U to y=3 at t=12.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=9, need to go up 6 times, to t=18 or something.\n\nWorse than staying at y=2.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2 for t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, back to reaching y=9.\n\nIn my first plan, with actions:\n\nt=8: S, so at t=9, y=2\n\nt=9: U, so at t=10, y=3\n\nThen t=10: U, to y=4 at t=11\n\n...\n\nUp to t=15: U, to y=9 at t=16\n\nAt turn t=16, y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, can I be at a higher y earlier?\n\nAt t=10, I am at y=3.\n\nBut y=3 to y=8 are all safe at t=10, so I can go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps, so from t=10 to t=15 for y=9? Let's see:\n\nStart at t=10, y=3\n\nAfter action at t=10, y_11=4\n\nt=11, y=4, choose U, y_12=5\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=15, y_16=9, so at t=16, y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at which turn am I at y=9? t=16.\n\nTo have y=9 at an earlier turn, I need to start going up earlier, but I cannot because of the unsafe times.\n\nAt t=8, if I could go to y=3, but I cannot because at t=9, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if I go to y=4, but at t=9, if I am on y=3, unsafe, but I cannot be on y=3 at t=9.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=3 is t=10.\n\nSimilarly for higher rows.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal, with actions from t=8 to t=16? No.\n\nH is the number of turns, actions from t=8 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nSet t_1 + H -1 =16, so H=9.\n\nActions: for t from 0 to 8, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nSo a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12, a_13, a_14, a_15, a_16? That's 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=16, I am already at y=9, so choosing action at t=16 is unnecessary, but I have to specify until the reach turn.\n\nIn the action list, for a_16, I can choose S, for example.\n\nBut let's confirm the position.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=15.\n\nHow?\n\nIf I can be at y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut from where? At t=14, if I am at y=8, and I choose U, then at t=15, y=9.\n\nBut when can I be at y=8?\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=14, I need to have been at y=7 at t=13, and so on.\n\nBut I start at y=2 at t=8.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 steps up, but I need to wait 2 turns at start, so minimum 9 turns to reach, I think.\n\nAt t=8, y=2.\n\nIf I could go up immediately, at t=9 y=3, but unsafe.\n\nSo I must spend at least 2 turns before I can go to y=3.\n\nThe first time I can be at y=3 is t=10.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, so at t=16, y=9.\n\nIf I go up every turn from t=10 to t=15, y from 3 to 9 at t=16.\n\nt=10: y=3\n\nt=11: y=4\n\n...\n\nt=15: y=8\n\nt=16: y=9\n\nYes.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=15, for example, then at t=15, y=8, and I choose U to go to y=9 at t=16, but at t=15 I am not yet at y=9.\n\nUnless I am at y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=15, I need to be at y=8 at t=14, and choose U at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, y=8, choose U, y_15=9, so at t=15, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=14, need y=7 at t=13, etc.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=10 to y=8 at t=15: that's 5 steps? y=3 to y=8 is 5 steps: y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt t=10: y=3\n\nAfter action U at t=10, y_11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, U, y_12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, U, y_13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, U, y_14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, U, y_15=8\n\nAt t=15: y=8\n\nThen at t=15, choose U, y_16=9, at t=16 y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=15, I need at t=14 to be at y=8 and choose U.\n\nBut at t=14, if I am at y=8, and choose U, then at t=15, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=14, I need to have started from lower earlier.\n\nEarliest at y=3 is t=10.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=8 in 5 steps: t=10 to t=14.\n\nt=10: y=3\n\nt=11: y=4 (after action at t=10)\n\nPosition at turn:\n\nt=10: y=3\n\nAfter a_t=10 U, y_11=4\n\nt=11: y=4\n\na_t=11 U, y_12=5\n\nt=12: y=5\n\na_t=12 U, y_13=6\n\nt=13: y=6\n\na_t=13 U, y_14=7\n\nt=14: y=7\n\na_t=14 U, y_15=8\n\nt=15: y=8\n\nThen a_t=15 U, y_16=9\n\nt=16: y=9\n\nSo at t=15, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=14, for example.\n\nAt t=14, y=8.\n\nThen from above, at t=14, y=8 only if I was at y=7 at t=13 and chose U at t=13.\n\nBut at t=13, y=7, which requires y=6 at t=12, etc.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=10 to y=8 at t=14: that would require 5 steps in 4 turns? From t=10 to t=14, 4 turns to increase y by 5? Impossible, since each turn y increases by at most 1.\n\nFrom t=10 to t=14, positions: at t=10 y=3, after actions, at t=11 y=4, t=12 y=5, t=13 y=6, t=14 y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=14, I need at t=13 to be at y=7 and choose U.\n\nBut at t=13, y=7 requires y=6 at t=12, and so on down to y=3 at t=10.\n\nSo y=3 at t=10, y=4 at t=11, y=5 at t=12, y=6 at t=13, y=7 at t=14, y=8 at t=15.\n\nCannot be higher than y=3 at t=10.\n\nThus, earliest y=9 is at t=16.\n\nH=9, with actions from t=8 to t=16? t_1 + H -1 =16.\n\nActions: a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12, a_13, a_14, a_15.\n\nThat's 8 actions? t from 0 to H-1, H=9, t=0 to 8, actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to 8, so times 8 to 16.\n\nBut at t=16, we need to choose action, but we reach at t=16 with y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for a_16, since at t=16 y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, in the action list for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the actions for my path.\n\nAt t=8: choose S (to stay at y=2 for t=9)\n\nAt t=9: choose U (to go to y=3 for t=10)\n\nAt t=10: choose U (to y=4 for t=11)\n\nAt t=11: choose U (to y=5 for t=12)\n\nAt t=12: choose U (to y=6 for t=13)\n\nAt t=13: choose U (to y=7 for t=14)\n\nAt t=14: choose U (to y=8 for t=15)\n\nAt t=15: choose U (to y=9 for t=16)\n\nNow, at turn t=16, we are at y=9, so for the action at t=16, since we have to specify, but we already reached at t=16, so perhaps we don't need to act, but the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{16}, which is for turn t=16.\n\nAt turn t=16, we are at y=9, and we choose an action, say S, to stay, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list actions until the reach turn.\n\nIn this case, with H=9, actions at t=8 to t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, we choose action after reaching? It's a bit messy.\n\nPerhaps I can have the last action at t=15 to reach at t=16.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions at t=8 to t=15, 8 actions, and at t=16, y=9, so turn t=16 is when we are at (0,9).\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nNow, the actions are for t=8 to t=16.\n\nFor t=16, since y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, but let's confirm if all are safe.\n\nPath:\n\nTurn t=8: at y=2, choose S. Then y_9=2. At t=9, we are on y=2.\n\nt=9: y=2, safe? Yes, as earlier.\n\nChoose U, so y_10=3.\n\nt=10: on y=3. Is it safe? t=10, Δt=2, freeway 3: as before, safe.\n\nChoose U, y_11=4.\n\nt=11: on y=4, Δt=3, freeway 4: cars, first car span at Δt=3: [-11 + 18, 0 + 18]? For freeway 4, same as 3.\n\nAt Δt=3: left = -11 + 6*3 = -11+18=7, right=0+18=18? Earlier for y=3 at Δt=2: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3: left= -11+18=7, right=18, [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [37+18,48+18]=[55,66], no. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 same.\n\nt=11: on y=4, safe, choose U, y_12=5.\n\nt=12: on y=5, safe, U to y_13=6.\n\nt=13: on y=6, U to y_14=7.\n\nt=14: on y=7, U to y_15=8.\n\nt=15: on y=8, U to y_16=9.\n\nt=16: on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, actions: at t=8: S\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nAnd for t=16, since we are at y=9, we need action, but H=9 includes a_{16}.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 8.\n\nt=0: t_1 +0=8, a_8\n\nt=1: t_1+1=9, a_9\n\n...\n\nt=8: t_1+8=16, a_16\n\nAt t=16, we choose a_16, say S.\n\nBut in the path, after a_15 U, we are at y=9 at t=16, so a_16 can be S.\n\nNow, but H=9, minimal.\n\nIs there a way with H=8?\n\nSuppose I can be at y=9 at t=15.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =15, 8 + H -1=15, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen at turn t=15, y=9.\n\nThat means at t=14, I must be at y=8 and choose U at t=14.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=14, I need to be at y=7 at t=13, etc.\n\nEarliest at y=3 is t=10.\n\nThen y=4 at t=11, y=5 at t=12, y=6 at t=13, y=7 at t=14, y=8 at t=15.\n\nThen at t=15, y=8, not 9.\n\nIf I choose U at t=15, y_16=9, at t=16 y=9.\n\nCannot be at y=9 before t=16.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nIn the actions, for H=8, actions from t=8 to t=15, but at t=15 y=8, not 9.\n\nSo not reached.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, I have a_8 to a_15 as above, and a_16.\n\nBut a_16 is at turn t=16, when we are at y=9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, at t=8: S\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: S (or whatever)\n\nBut in the car states, is there any issue at other times?\n\nFor example, at t=11, on y=4, but freeway 4 is safe, etc.\n\nWhat about freeway 1 and 2? But I am not on them except at start.\n\ny=2 only at t=8 and t=9, both safe.\n\ny=1 not visited.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 2 has only one car, but we handled.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the format.\n\nAlso, note that for freeway 3 to 8, all have cars at t=8 and t=9, but we avoid them.\n\nNow, write the actions.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut for turn 16, since we reached, but we have to include.\n\nPerhaps we can choose no action, but we need to specify.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=8.\n\nSequence of actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_8 to a_{8+8} = a_16? t_1 + H -1 =8+9-1=16.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut at turn 16, we are already at y=9, and we choose S to stay, but it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can end at turn 15, but at turn 15, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, I could have gone down, but it's worse.\n\nPerhaps I can go to other rows faster, but no.\n\nOne more point: the collision note.\n\nIt says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, since when I move, I am not on the new row until next turn, so it should be fine.\n\nFor example, when I move from y=2 to y=3 at turn t=9, at turn t=9 I am on y=2, not on y=3, so even if y=3 is unsafe at t=9, I am not on it, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y=3 at t=10, it is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to go from y=2 to y=9, and I have 8 up moves, but with one stay at start.\n\nActions: one S and 8 U, but 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, a_8=S, a_9=U, a_10=U, ..., a_15=U, a_16=S.\n\nThat's 9 actions: one S, seven U? a_9 to a_15 is seven U? a_9,10,11,12,13,14,15: that's seven U, plus a_8 S and a_16 S.\n\na_8: S\n\na_9: U\n\na_10: U\n\na_11: U\n\na_12: U\n\na_13: U\n\na_14: U\n\na_15: U  // this is to go from y=8 to y=9 at t=16\n\na_16: S  // at t=16, stay\n\nNumber of actions: from t=8 to t=16, 9 actions.\n\nBut a_9 to a_15 are seven U, but a_15 U is from y=8 to y=9.\n\nIn terms of moves: I moved up 7 times: from y=2 to y=3 (a_9 U), y3 to y4 (a_10 U), ..., up to y7 to y8 (a_14 U), then y8 to y9 (a_15 U), and one initial stay a_8 S, and one final stay a_16 S.\n\nBut a_16 S is after reaching.\n\nThe minimal H is 9.\n\nPerhaps I don't need the last action if I reach exactly, but according to the task, I need to specify until t_1 + H -1 when I reach.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 1 has cars that might affect, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 2 at t=10 unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=10, I am on y=3, not y=2.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut at turn 16, since y=9, if I choose U, it might go to y=10, but y max 9, so probably it stays or error, but in the dynamics, y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, clamped to [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, y=9.\n\nSimilarly D to 8, but we choose S to stay.\n\nAnyway.\n\nPerhaps I can have a_16 as U, but it stays.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Times\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe at turns \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\) (relative \\(\\Delta t = 3, 4\\)). Safe at other times.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe at turn \\(t = 10\\) (relative \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)). Safe at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\).\n- **Freeways 3 to 8 (y=3 to y=8)**: Unsafe at turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (relative \\(\\Delta t = 0, 1\\)). Safe at \\(t \\geq 10\\).\n- **y=0 and y=9**: Always safe (no cars).\n\nThe earliest the player can be on \\(y=3\\) or higher is \\(t = 10\\), as these rows are unsafe at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\). Starting at \\(y=2\\) at \\(t=8\\), which is safe, the player must avoid moving to \\(y=3\\) at \\(t=9\\) (unsafe) and cannot be on \\(y=2\\) at \\(t=10\\) (unsafe).\n\n### Optimal Path\n- At \\(t=8\\), the player is at \\(y=2\\). Choosing **S (stay)** keeps the player at \\(y=2\\) for \\(t=9\\), which is safe.\n- At \\(t=9\\), the player is at \\(y=2\\). Choosing **U (up)** moves to \\(y=3\\) for \\(t=10\\), which is safe.\n- From \\(t=10\\) to \\(t=15\\), the player moves up each turn: at \\(y=3\\) (t=10), \\(y=4\\) (t=11), \\(y=5\\) (t=12), \\(y=6\\) (t=13), \\(y=7\\) (t=14), \\(y=8\\) (t=15), all safe as \\(y=3\\) to \\(y=8\\) are safe for \\(t \\geq 10\\).\n- At \\(t=15\\), choosing **U (up)** moves to \\(y=9\\) for \\(t=16\\).\n- At \\(t=16\\), the player is at \\(y=9\\). Choosing **S (stay)** maintains the position, as the target is reached.\n\nThe sequence involves one stay (S) at \\(t=8\\), seven up moves (U) from \\(t=9\\) to \\(t=15\\), and one stay (S) at \\(t=16\\) after reaching the target. The minimal \\(H\\) is 9, as the player reaches (0,9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 8 + 9 - 1 = 16\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=8}^{16}\\) is:\n- Turn 8: S (stay at \\(y=2\\) for turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y=3\\) for turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y=4\\) for turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move to \\(y=5\\) for turn 12)\n- Turn 12: U (move to \\(y=6\\) for turn 13)\n- Turn 13: U (move to \\(y=7\\) for turn 14)\n- Turn 14: U (move to \\(y=8\\) for turn 15)\n- Turn 15: U (move to \\(y=9\\) for turn 16)\n- Turn 16: S (stay at \\(y=9\\), target reached)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as verified per the car states and update rules.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ S}\n}",

Let me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: three cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 2: one car: (-12,-47,right,36)\n\n- Freeways 3 to 8: each has two cars: (6,-5,right,6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=9. For any future turn T, the car spans move right because they're all right-moving. The span at time T is [tail + s*(T-t_1), head + s*(T-t_1)] for right-moving cars. Since they're moving right, the head is on the right, tail on the left, so the span is [τ, h] and it becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)].\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway. That means if x=0 is covered by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I move from y to y+1 or y-1 at turn T, I'm not on y+1 at turn T, only at turn T+1. So I don't collide with cars on y+1 at turn T if I'm moving to it.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 with x=0.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are cars only on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, I think. y=9 has no cars, so once I'm there, I'm safe.\n\nBut I start at y=2, so I need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least 7, since from y=2 to y=9, I need to gain 7 units, and each up move increases y by 1, so minimum 7 up moves, but I can also stay or move down, but that would increase H, so probably H min is 7 if I can go straight up without colliding.\n\nBut I need to check if that's possible with the cars.\n\nSince I have to avoid collisions, I might need to wait or move down sometimes, but that would increase H.\n\nFirst, let's define the time. Let τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn t_1=9.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2.\n\nI need to find actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for τ from 0 to H-1.\n\ny at τ is y_{t_1 + τ}.\n\ny_τ for simplicity, with τ starting from 0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2.\n\nI need y at some τ = H-1 to be 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so after H actions, I reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at position for turn t_1, before action.\n\nAfter action a_t, I move to position for turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo starting at turn t_1, I am at y_{t_1} = 2.\n\nI choose a_{t_1}, then at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} = something.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), which I think means at some turn, y=9.\n\nThe task says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after action at t_1 + H -1, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, y is set.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position before action a_{t_1 + H -1}, I think.\n\nClarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen player chooses action a_t.\n\nThen the position updates: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with bounds.\n\nAnd cars move, etc.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t when player is on y_t.\n\nThe collision condition: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, if player is on row y_T, and for that row, at that turn, x=0 is covered by a car, then collision.\n\nNow, when you move, if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} = y_T +1 or -1, then at turn T, you are on y_T, so you can collide with cars on y_T if 0 in span.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you can collide with cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span.\n\nIf you stay, you are on the same row.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so collision possible only with cars on y_T.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so with cars on y_{T+1}.\n\nBack to the sequence.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before action.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H -1} + Δy_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nBut I need y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, so at the beginning of turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, and I might take an action, but since I'm already at 9, I can just stay or whatever, but the position is already 9, so I think I have reached.\n\nThe condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, which is at the start of turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen I need to specify actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, if H=1, I need to be at 9 at turn t_1, but I'm at 2, so impossible. Min H is 7, as I said.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, I need to increase y by 7, so at least 7 up actions, and if I do only up, H=7 actions: from τ=0 to τ=6, actions U each, then at τ=7, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t_1), y=2, after a_{t_1} = U, y_{t_1+1} = 3\n\nAfter a_{t_1+1} = U, y_{t_1+2} = 4\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 U actions: at turn t_1+6, y_{t_1+6} = 8? Start at y=2.\n\nAfter first U (at t_1), y_{t_1+1} =3\n\nAfter second U (t_1+1), y_{t_1+2} =4\n\n...\n\nAfter k U actions, y_{t_1+k} = 2 + k\n\nSet 2 + k =9, so k=7, so after 7 U actions, y_{t_1+7} = 2+7=9\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so if H-1 =7, H=8, then y_{t_1+7} =9.\n\nIf H is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, so actions at τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nAfter action at τ=H-1, y at turn t_1 + (H-1) +1 = t_1 + H is set.\n\nBut we need y at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1 is before action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter that action, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need the position at the start of turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nSo for example, to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFrom start, at turn t_1, y=2.\n\nAfter actions, to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal turn to reach y=9 is when we go up as fast as possible.\n\nWith U actions only, after 7 U actions, we reach y=9 at turn t_1+7.\n\nAt turn t_1+7, y=9, which is the start of turn t_1+7.\n\nIn terms of the index, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo if H-1 =7, then H=8, so we have 8 actions, but we only need 7 U to go from 2 to 9? Let's list the turns.\n\nLet t = t_1 + τ for τ from 0.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t chosen, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =2.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe smallest T is t_1 +7, with y_{t_1+7} =9, achieved by a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+6} all U.\n\nThen at turn t_1+7, y=9, so for H, if we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, set T = t_1 + H -1, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +7, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+7}, but we need up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{t_1+7}.\n\nBut with a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+6} all U, y_{t_1+7} =9, and at turn t_1+7, we are at y=9, so we can choose a_{t_1+7}, but it doesn't matter, we can set it to S or whatever, but the position is already 9 at the start of turn t_1+7.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, which for H=8, is t_1 to t_1+7.\n\nWith a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+6} = U, and a_{t_1+7} can be S, for example.\n\nBut since we are already at 9, we don't need to move, so S is fine.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is turn t_1+7, with H-1=7, H=8.\n\nIf we can reach earlier, but from 2 to 9, we need at least 7 up moves, so turn t_1+7 is the earliest possible, with 7 actions before.\n\nH includes the actions to reach.\n\nWith H=8, we have 8 actions, but we only need 7 to move up, the last action at t_1+7 is not necessary for moving, but we have to include it because y_{t_1+H-1} must be 9, which it is at t_1+7 for H=8.\n\nFor H=7, y_{t_1+6} would need to be 9, but at turn t_1+6, with actions from t_1 to t_1+5, we can have y_{t_1+6} =2 + number of U in first 6 actions, max 8, min 2, so 9 is possible only if we have 7 U in 6 actions, impossible. So min H is 8, with y_{t_1+7} =9.\n\nSimilarly, if we start at y=0, to reach y=9, min H=10, with y_{t_1+9} =9 after 9 U actions, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nHere from 2, min H=8.\n\nBut we may need to take detours due to cars, so H could be larger.\n\nBut let's first see if direct up is possible.\n\nSo from y=2, I want to go to y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut at each step, when I am on a freeway, I need to ensure that at that turn, for that row, x=0 is not covered by a car.\n\nAlso, when I move, I need to be safe on the row I'm on.\n\nNow, the freeways are y=1 to 8, each with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are always safe.\n\nBut I start at y=2, which is a freeway with cars.\n\nAt turn t_1=9, I am on y=2, so I need to check if at turn 9, for y=2, is x=0 covered?\n\nFreeway 2 has cars: only one car: (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nAt time t_1=9, τ=0, the car span is [τ, h] but in the state it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), for right-moving, head is the front, so larger x, tail smaller.\n\nIn the car state: for freeway 2: (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nI think head and tail: head is -12, tail is -47, so since right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span is from tail to head, [ -47, -12]? But -47 < -12, so [ -47, -12].\n\nThen at time T, span is [ τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1) ]\n\nSo at t_1=9, τ=0, span = [ -47, -12]\n\nThen at turn T, span = [ -47 + 36(T-9), -12 + 36(T-9) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval for freeway y=2 at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFirst, at current turn t_1=9, I am on y=2.\n\nFor freeway 2 at τ=0 (T=9), span of the car: [ -47, -12], 0 is not in [-47,-12], since -12 <0? -12 is less than 0, -47 is more negative, so -47 to -12, all negative, 0 > -12, so 0 not in [ -47, -12], so no collision at t=9 on y=2.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=3,4,etc.\n\nBut let's list all car positions over time.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving with constant speed, I can find when x=0 is covered for each freeway.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, I can find the time interval when 0 is in the span, i.e., when the car covers x=0.\n\nThen for that freeway, at times when any car covers x=0, it is dangerous to be on that row.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nThe span covers x=0 when min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T: [ τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1) ]\n\nSet L(T) = τ + s(T-t_1)\n\nH(T) = h + s(T-t_1)\n\n0 in span if L(T) <= 0 <= H(T)\n\nSince s>0, L and H increase with T.\n\nFind T such that L(T) <= 0 and H(T) >=0.\n\nSince L(T) <= H(T) always.\n\nSolve L(T) <= 0: τ + s(T-t_1) <= 0\n\ns(T-t_1) <= -τ\n\nT-t_1 <= -τ / s\n\nSimilarly, H(T) >=0: h + s(T-t_1) >=0\n\ns(T-t_1) >= -h\n\nT-t_1 >= -h / s\n\nThen the time interval for danger is from T such that T-t_1 >= ceil( -h/s ) to T-t_1 <= floor( -τ/s )? Let's be careful with inequalities.\n\nL(T) <=0: τ + s(T-t_1) <=0\n\ns(T-t_1) <= -τ\n\nSince s>0, T-t_1 <= -τ / s\n\nSimilarly, H(T) >=0: h + s(T-t_1) >=0\n\ns(T-t_1) >= -h\n\nT-t_1 >= -h / s\n\nThen 0 in span when max( ceil( -h/s ) , something) to min( floor( -τ/s ), etc.)\n\nSince T integer, find min T such that H(T) >=0 and max T such that L(T) <=0.\n\nEasier to compute for each car.\n\nSet δ = T - t_1, so time offset.\n\nFor each car, find δ such that 0 in span at δ.\n\nCar on freeway k, with (h, τ, d, s) at t_1.\n\nSince all right, d=right.\n\nFor freeway 1, three cars:\n\nCar A: h=-12, τ=-23, s=6? Head and tail: in the state, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so for car on freeway 1: first car (-12,-23,right,6), so head h=-12, tail τ=-23.\n\nThen at δ, span [ τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-23 + 6δ, -12 + 6δ]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 6δ <= 0 and -12 + 6δ >=0\n\nSo -23 + 6δ <=0 => 6δ <=23 => δ <= 23/6 = 3.833, so δ <=3 since δ integer\n\n-12 +6δ >=0 => 6δ >=12 => δ >=2\n\nSo δ >=2 and δ <=3\n\nThus at δ=2 and δ=3, 0 is covered for this car on freeway 1.\n\nδ= T - t_1, so at T=t_1+2=11 and T=t_1+3=12, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 1: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\nSpan [-59 +6δ, -48 +6δ]\n\n0 in: -59+6δ <=0 => 6δ <=59 => δ <=59/6=9.833, δ<=9\n\n-48+6δ >=0 => 6δ>=48 => δ>=8\n\nSo δ=8,9\n\nT= t_1+8=17, t_1+9=18\n\nThird car on freeway 1: (30,19,right,6) head=30, tail=19? 19 to 30, but since right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so if tail=19, head=30, that means from 19 to 30, so span [19,30] at δ=0.\n\nThen at δ, [19+6δ, 30+6δ]\n\nNow, 0 in: 19+6δ <=0? 19+6δ <=0 => 6δ <= -19, impossible since δ>=0\n\nSimilarly, 30+6δ >=0 always true for δ>=0.\n\nSo min is 19+6δ >=19>0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous when cars cover x=0.\n\nCar A: δ=2,3\n\nCar B: δ=8,9\n\nCar C: never\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous at δ=2,3,8,9\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nh=-12, τ=-47, s=36\n\nSpan [-47 +36δ, -12 +36δ]\n\n0 in: -47+36δ <=0 => 36δ <=47 => δ <=47/36≈1.305, δ<=1\n\n-12+36δ >=0 => 36δ>=12 => δ>=12/36=1/3≈0.333, so δ>=1 since δ integer.\n\nδ>=1 and δ<=1, so only δ=1\n\nThus at δ=1, T=t_1+1=10\n\nFreeway 2 dangerous only at δ=1, T=10.\n\nNow freeways 3 to 8: each has two cars: (6,-5,right,6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (6,-5,right,6) head=6, tail=-5, s=6\n\nSpan [-5 +6δ, 6 +6δ]\n\n0 in: -5+6δ <=0 => 6δ <=5 => δ <=5/6≈0.833, δ<=0\n\nAnd 6+6δ >=0 always.\n\nδ<=0 and δ>=? -5+6δ <=0 for δ<=0.833, since δ integer, δ=0\n\nAt δ=0, -5+0 = -5 <=0, 6+0=6>=0, yes.\n\nFor δ=0, L= -5 <=0, H=6>=0, yes.\n\nFor δ=1, L= -5+6=1 >0, so L=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nSimilarly, δ=-1, but δ=T-t_1 >=0, since T>=t_1, so only δ=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (54,43,right,6) head=54, tail=43, span [43+6δ,54+6δ] min 43>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo for each freeway 3 to 8, dangerous only at δ=0, T=t_1=9.\n\nThat is, only at the current turn, for these rows.\n\nNow, freeway 1 dangerous at δ=2,3 (T=11,12) and δ=8,9 (T=17,18)\n\nFreeway 2 dangerous at δ=1 (T=10)\n\nFreeways 3-8 dangerous at δ=0 (T=9)\n\nI am starting at y=2 at turn t_1=9, δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0, T=9:\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous? At δ=0, for freeway 2, we have car span [-47,-12], 0 not in, so safe. Earlier we computed dangerous only at δ=1.\n\nFor freeway 2, dangerous at δ=1, not at δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0, span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFor freeways 3-8, at δ=0, dangerous, because for each, the first car covers x=0.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: car (6,-5,right,6), span at δ=0: [-5,6], which includes 0, since -5<=0<=6.\n\nSimilarly for 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo at T=9, δ=0, freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are all dangerous because x=0 covered.\n\nBut I am on y=2 at T=9, which is freeway 2, and freeway 2 is safe at T=9, as above.\n\nNow, I need to move up.\n\nThe minimal H is 8, with y=9 at T=t_1+7.\n\nI need to be on different rows at different times without collision.\n\nSince I start at y=2 at T=9.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by T= t_1+7 =16? t_1=9, t_1+7=16.\n\ny_{t_1+7} =9 at turn 16.\n\nWith actions from t=9 to t=15? Let's list the turns.\n\nSet T from t_1=9 onwards.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor T=9, y_9=2\n\nThen I choose a_9, then y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need y_T for T from 9 to some point.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 16 (t_1+7), which is T=16.\n\ny_{16} =9.\n\nNow, the actions: a_9 to a_{15}, since after a_{15}, y_{16} is set.\n\ny_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}\n\nTo have y_{16}=9, and y_{15} must be such that with Δy_{15}, it becomes 9, so y_{15} could be 8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 invalid, so y_{15}=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{15}=9, then Δy_{15} could be 0 or -1, but if I go down, y_{16}=8, not 9. So to have y_{16}=9, if y_{15}=9, I need Δy_{15}=0, so S.\n\nIf y_{15}=8, I need U to go to 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{15}=9, I can stay.\n\nBut to reach at turn 16, y_{16}=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which for H=8, t_1 + H -1 =9+7=16, so y_{16}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWith H=8, actions from t=9 to t=15 (since t from t_1 to t_1+H-1=9 to 15)\n\nThen after a_{15}, y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}\n\nSet y_{16}=9.\n\ny_{15} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{15}=8, then a_{15}=U\n\nIf y_{15}=9, then a_{15}=S or D, but D would make y_{16}=8, not 9, so must S.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn 16, so if y_{15}=9, and we do S, y_{16}=9, good.\n\nIf we do U from 8, y_{16}=9.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to be on row y at turn T, and for that, if y between 1 and 8, it must not be dangerous at that time.\n\nDanger times:\n\nFor each row, times when dangerous:\n\ny=1: dangerous at δ=2,3 (T=11,12) and δ=8,9 (T=17,18)\n\nδ=T-t_1, so T=11,12 and 17,18\n\ny=2: dangerous only at δ=1, T=10\n\ny=3: dangerous at δ=0, T=9\n\nSimilarly y=4,5,6,7,8 all dangerous at T=9 only, since for each, only at δ=0.\n\ny=3 to 8 all dangerous only at T=9.\n\ny=1 dangerous at T=11,12,17,18\n\ny=2 dangerous at T=10\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI start at T=9, y=2.\n\nAt T=9, y=2 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I need to go up.\n\nSuppose I go up directly.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, safe.\n\nI can choose a_9 = U, then y_{10} = 2 +1 =3\n\nBut at T=10, y=3? y_{10} is position at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, if I am on y=3, I need to check if safe.\n\ny=3 is freeway, dangerous at T=9? But T=10 is δ=1.\n\nFor y=3, dangerous only at δ=0, T=9, as per above.\n\nAt T=10, δ=1, for freeway 3, the car: at δ=1, span [ -5 +6*1, 6+6*1] = [1,12], 1>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for all y=3 to 8, at T=10, δ=1, not dangerous, since only dangerous at δ=0.\n\ny=2 dangerous at T=10, δ=1.\n\nBut at T=10, if I am on y=3, not y=2.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nIf at T=9, y=2, I do U, then y_{10} =3.\n\nAt turn 10, y=3, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen I can do U again, a_{10} = U, then y_{11} =4\n\nAt turn 11, y=4, which is freeway 4, dangerous only at T=9, so at T=11 safe.\n\nSimilarly, continue.\n\nBut at some point, y=1 might be dangerous, but I'm going up, not to y=1.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=4, etc.\n\nLet's list:\n\nT=9: y=2, safe\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=3\n\nT=10: y=3, safe (since not dangerous at T=10)\n\na_{10}=U, y_{11}=4\n\nT=11: y=4, safe\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=5\n\nT=12: y=5, safe\n\na_{12}=U, y_{13}=6\n\nT=13: y=6, safe\n\na_{13}=U, y_{14}=7\n\nT=14: y=7, safe\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=8\n\nT=15: y=8, now at T=15, δ=6, for freeway 8, dangerous only at T=9, so safe.\n\na_{15}=U, then y_{16}=9\n\nT=16: y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =16, which is y_{16}=9.\n\nIn this sequence, with actions a_9 to a_{15}, all U, and y from 2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at turns 10 to 16.\n\ny_{16}=9.\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nAt each turn, on the row, is it safe?\n\nT=9: y=2, safe, as before.\n\nT=10: y=3, freeway 3, at T=10, δ=1, span for car: [ -5+6, 6+6] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=11: y=4, freeway 4, at T=11, δ=2, span [ -5 +12, 6+12]? At δ=2, L= -5 +12=7? s=6, δ=2, L= -5 + 6*2 = -5+12=7, H=6+12=18, span [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all y=3 to 8 at T>=10 are safe, since only dangerous at T=9.\n\ny=1 is dangerous at T=11,12, but I'm not on y=1.\n\nIn this sequence, I am on y=4 at T=11, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut at T=15, y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is always safe.\n\nIn this case, with all U from T=9 to T=15, I reach y=9 at T=16.\n\nH=8, actions from t=9 to 15.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =15 for H=8? t_1=9, H=8, t_1 + H -1 =9+7=16.\n\nActions from t=9 to t=15, that's 7 actions: t=9,10,11,12,13,14,15.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=7, so 8 actions? Indices.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=8, t from 0 to 7, so actions at t_1 +0 =9, t_1+1=10, ..., t_1+7=15.\n\nThat's 8 actions: a9 to a15.\n\nWith a9 to a14 all U, and a15=U to go from y15 to y16=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=15, y=8, then a15=U, y16=9.\n\ny15=8 at turn 15.\n\nWe need y at turn t_1 + H -1 =16 to be 9, which is y16=9.\n\nIn this case, with a9 to a14: U, U, U, U, U, U (6 actions, from t=9 to 14), then y15 = y14 + Δy14.\n\nStart: after a9 U, y10=3\n\na10 U, y11=4\n\n...\n\na13 U, y14=7? Let's list y_t:\n\nT=9: y9=2\n\na9=U, y10=3\n\nT=10: y10=3\n\na10=U, y11=4\n\nT=11: y11=4\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nT=12: y12=5\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nT=13: y13=6\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\nT=14: y14=7\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\nT=15: y15=8\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nT=16: y16=9\n\nYes, all safe as above.\n\nBut at T=15, y=8, which is fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with H smaller? H=8 is minimal, as we need 7 up moves.\n\nH=8 actions to reach at turn 16.\n\nBut in the actions, a15 is needed to reach y16=9 from y15=8.\n\nCould I be at y=9 earlier?\n\nAt turn 15, y15=9, but with actions from t=9 to 14, I can reach at most y14=2 +6=8 if all U, so y15=8 or less, cannot be 9 at turn 15.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9, for H=7, t_1 + H -1=9+6=15, so need y15=9.\n\nBut to have y15=9, with actions from t=9 to 14 (H=7 actions), y15 = y9 + sum of Δy from t=9 to 14.\n\ny9=2, sum of Δy over 6 actions, each at most +1, so y15 <= 2+6=8, cannot be 9. So impossible to have y15=9. Thus min H=8.\n\nSo with the above sequence, it works.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 1, it has cars, but I didn't go to y=1, so no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, I go from y=2 to 3 to 4... to 9, all good.\n\nBut at T=10, y=3 is safe, etc.\n\nThe problem is that for freeways 3-8, at T=9, they are dangerous, but I was on y=2 at T=9, not on them.\n\nThen at T=10, when I am on y=3, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, but let's confirm freeway 2 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, freeway 2 is dangerous, but I am on y=3 at T=10, not y=2, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo it seems the direct path works with H=8.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nH=8, actions from t=9 to 15.\n\na9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U? a15=U to go to y16=9.\n\nIn the sequence, all U.\n\nBut at T=15, y=8, I do U to go to 9.\n\nI could have reached earlier? No.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or something, but that would increase H.\n\nSo minimal is 8 turns.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 2 at T=10 dangerous, but I avoid by not being there.\n\nIn this case, I am on y=3 at T=10, safe.\n\nNow, but the player position: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, then I choose action.\n\nIn this case, all fine.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_9 = U\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: a_{10} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +7: a_{15} = U? t_1 +7 =16, but actions up to t_1 + H -1 =15 for H=8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =9+7=16? H=8, t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +7 =16.\n\nAction at t_1 + H -1 =16? No.\n\nActions: for t from 0 to H-1, action at time t_1 + t.\n\nSo for t=0, action at t_1 +0 = t_1\n\nt=1, action at t_1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, action at t_1 + H -1\n\nThen after that, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, y is set.\n\nWe need y at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9? No.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is before the action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the minimal case, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at some turn earlier.\n\nWith H smaller.\n\nBut from y=2, to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=7, t_1 + H -1 =9+6=15, y_{15}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{15}=9, with actions from t=9 to 14 (since actions a_t for t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1? H=7, actions from t= t_1 to t_1 +6, i.e., t=9 to 14.\n\nThen y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}, but y_{15} is position at turn 15 before action? Let's clarify.\n\nStandard: at start of turn t, position y_t.\n\nChoose action a_t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo y_{t+1} is set after action a_t.\n\nThus, for turn t, y_t is given, then a_t chosen, then y_{t+1} computed.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, but we don't care about after, as long as we are at 9 at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for H=7, we need y_{15} =9.\n\nBut y_{15} depends on previous actions.\n\ny_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}, but y_{14} is at turn 14, etc.\n\nWith actions from t=9 to 14 (6 actions), y_{15} = y_9 + sum_{t=9}^{14} Δy_t\n\ny_9=2, each Δy_t <=1, so y_{15} <= 2+6=8 <9, cannot be 9.\n\nThus impossible for H=7.\n\nFor H=8, we need y_{16} =9.\n\ny_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}\n\nWith actions from t=9 to 15 (7 actions), y_{16} = y_9 + sum_{t=9}^{15} Δy_t = 2 + sum of 7 deltas.\n\nMax 2+7=9, min less.\n\nTo have y_{16}=9, need exactly 7 up moves in the actions from t=9 to 15.\n\nBut y_{16} =9, which is after action a_{15}.\n\nIn terms of the position at turn, y_{t_1 + H -1} for H=8 is y_{16}, which we set to 9.\n\nIn the sequence I had, with a9 to a15 all U, y16=9.\n\nBut y_{16} is the position at turn 16, which is what we want.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 16, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we don't take action at turn 16 in the sequence, since actions up to t=15.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, all U.\n\nBut in my earlier, I thought y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position, but for H=8, t_1 + H -1=16, y_{16}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the direct path, it seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point I might collide.\n\nFor example, at turn T=10, if I were on y=2, it would be dangerous, but I am on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the move.\n\nAnother thing: when I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am on y, so I need safe on y at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y+1, need safe on y+1 at T+1.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=9: on y=2, safe\n\na9=U, move to y=3 at T+1=10.\n\nAt T=10, on y=3, which is safe as above.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut for freeway 1, it has dangerous times, but since I don't go to y=1, no problem.\n\nNow, the only potential issue is if I need to wait, but in this case, no need.\n\nSo minimal H=8 with all U actions.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 2 at T=10 dangerous, but I avoid.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but cannot.\n\nSo I think this should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeways 3-8, all have the same cars, but since I pass through them after T=9, they are safe.\n\nBut at T=9, they are dangerous, but I start at y=2.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut for H=8, actions from t=9 to 15, that's 7 actions? t from 0 to 7? Let's count.\n\nt_1 =9\n\nH=8\n\nActions at t_1 + t for t=0 to 7: so t=0: 9, t=1:10, t=2:11, t=3:12, t=4:13, t=5:14, t=6:15? t from 0 to H-1=7, so t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nt=0: action at 9+0=9\n\nt=1: 9+1=10\n\nt=2:11\n\nt=3:12\n\nt=4:13\n\nt=5:14\n\nt=6:15\n\nt=7:16? 9+7=16\n\nAction at turn 16?\n\nBut turn 16 is t_1 + H -1? t_1 + H -1=9+8-1=16, yes.\n\nAction at turn 16.\n\nThen y at turn 16 is before action a_{16}, but we need y_{16}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, if I have action at turn 16, but y_{16} is before action.\n\nTo have y_{16}=9, it must be that I am already at 9 at turn 16 before action.\n\nThen I can choose a_{16}, but since I am at 9, I might stay or whatever.\n\nIn the minimal path with all U, at turn 16, I am not at 9 yet.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 16, y_{16}=9, which is after the actions, but y_{16} is the position at start of turn 16.\n\nIn the sequence with actions up to a_{15}, after a_{15}, y_{16} is set to 9, so at start of turn 16, y_{16}=9.\n\nThen for the action sequence, we need to include a_{16}? No.\n\nActions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=8, t_1 to t_1+7=16.\n\nSo action at turn 16 must be specified.\n\nBut at turn 16, if y_{16}=9, I can choose S, for example.\n\nIn the all U sequence, how do I have y_{16}=9?\n\nWith actions a9 to a15 all U, y_{16}=9.\n\nThen at turn 16, y_{16}=9, and I need to choose a_{16}, but since I have to reach at turn t_1 + H -1=16, and y_{16}=9, I can set a_{16} to S.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=8, I have actions from a9 to a16.\n\na9 to a15 are U, then a16 can be S.\n\nBut with a9 to a15 U, I reach y16=9, then at turn 16, I am at y=9, and I do S, but y_{17} would be 9, but I don't care.\n\nThe position is already 9 at turn 16.\n\nTo minimize H, I should not have extra actions.\n\nIn this case, with H=8, I need to include action at turn 16, but since I am already at 9, I can do S.\n\nBut the minimal H is still 8, and I can have the sequence with a9 to a15 U and a16 S.\n\nBut with a9 to a15 U, I have 7 actions, but H=8 requires 8 actions.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so 8 actions.\n\nWith a9 to a15 U, that's actions at 9,10,11,12,13,14,15: 7 actions.\n\nThen I need one more action at t_1 + H -1 =16, a16.\n\nSince y_{16}=9, I can set a16=S.\n\nThen the sequence is:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut H=8, and y_{16}=9.\n\nI could have reached y_{15}=9 with fewer actions, but impossible as before.\n\nTo have y_{15}=9, I need to be at 9 at turn 15.\n\nThat would require with actions from t=9 to 14, but y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}, and y_{14} <= 2 + 5 =7 if all U up to a13, etc., cannot be 9.\n\ny_{15} = y_9 + sum_{t=9}^{14} Δy_t <= 2 + 6 =8 <9, impossible.\n\nSo yes, min H=8 with y_{16}=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 7 U and one S at the end.\n\nBut at turn 16, doing S is fine.\n\nSince I need to be at 9 at turn 16, and I am, so S is okay.\n\nTo save an action, but I cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by moving down or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, if I move down to y=1, but y=1 has dangerous times, and it might take more moves.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the direct path is fine.\n\nIn the output, for turn 16, action S.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states again.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 1, there is a car that is dangerous at T=17,18, but I am not on y=1, so fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut in the action, for turn 15: a15=U, which moves to y16=9.\n\nThen turn 16: a16=S, which stays at y17=9, but y16=9 is what matters.\n\nSince we need to reach at turn 16, and we are there, a16 can be anything, but S is safe.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut turn 16 is t_1 + 7, and H=8, t_1 + H -1=16.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I don't need the last S, but I have to include 8 actions.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at turn 15, but impossible.\n\nSo this is fine.\n\nBut in the initial thought, I thought with 7 actions I can reach, but due to the turn indexing, I need 8 actions to be at position at turn 16.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted the timing.\n\nAnother way: the position y_{t_1 + H -1} must be 9, which for H=8 is turn 16.\n\nWith actions from t=9 to 15, I set y16=9.\n\nThen action at turn 16 is separate, but since I am at 9, I can stay.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo for the output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) is 8, with the sequence of actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 9\\).\n\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 9. The sequence of actions is designed to move directly upward from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) without colliding with any cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The car positions and movements have been analyzed to ensure that at each turn, the player is not on a freeway where \\(x = 0\\) is covered by a car span at that turn.\n\n- At turn 9, the player is on \\(y = 2\\), which is safe since no car on freeway 2 covers \\(x = 0\\) at \\(\\delta = 0\\) (i.e., turn 9). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 10, \\(y = 3\\) is safe because freeways 3-8 are only dangerous at \\(\\delta = 0\\) (turn 9), and at \\(\\delta = 1\\) (turn 10), the car spans do not cover \\(x = 0\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\).\n- Similarly, turns 11 to 14 are safe on \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 7\\) respectively, as freeways 3-8 are only dangerous at turn 9. Actions \\(U\\) continue the upward movement.\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 8\\) is safe (dangerous only at turn 9).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 10, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x) at speed s per turn.\n- Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x) at speed s per turn.\n\nBut note: the car state is given at turn t1=10.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (at the end of turn T, meaning after moving) and at that moment the car on that freeway has its span covering x=0 at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from freeway y to freeway y' at turn T, during turn T the player is on freeway y (the starting freeway) until the move is completed. So at the moment of turn T, the player is on freeway y (and checks for collision on y) and then moves to y'. The new freeway y' is only occupied at the next turn? Actually, the rule says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are still on the old freeway (y_T) and then after the move we are on y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, at each turn T (starting from t1=10), we choose an action (U, D, S) that will change our y-coordinate (or not) and then we check for collision on the freeway we are on at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". Here, y_T is the player's position at the end of the turn? But note: the player update is: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t and then we are at y_{t+1}. However, the collision rule says \"at turn T\" and \"on freeway y_T\". \n\nLooking back: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\nBut note: at turn T, the player is at y_T (the starting position of the turn) or the ending? The rule is ambiguous. However, the note clarifies: if you move to a new freeway at turn T, you are not considered to be on that new freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on the freeway that they started the turn on.\n\nTherefore, at turn T (when we are about to take action a_T), we are currently on freeway y_T. Then we choose an action, and then we move to y_{T+1}. During the entire turn T, we are on freeway y_T. Thus, we must check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nSo the process for a turn T:\n1. Player is at (0, y_T) at the start of turn T.\n2. We choose a_T (U, D, S) and then update: y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, clamped to [0,9].\n3. But during turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. So we must check: is there a car on freeway y_T such that at turn T, the car's span includes 0? If yes, then collision.\n\nTherefore, at each turn, we must avoid being on a freeway that has a car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t1=10. We can compute their positions at any future turn T (relative to t1) by:\n\nFor a car given at turn 10 with (h, tau, d, s):\n- If right-moving: at turn T (T>=10), the span is [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]? \nBut note: the update rule says for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [since at t1, it was [tau, h] and then moves right]\n\nBut wait: the initial state for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). The head is the front? Then for a right-moving car, the head is at a larger x than the tail? Actually, the example: \n  For freeway 1: (-6, -17, right, 6) -> head=-6, tail=-17? That would mean the car is from x=-17 to x=-6? But then at turn 10, the car is moving right, so at turn T, the span becomes: \n  [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)] = [-17 + 6*(T-10), -6 + 6*(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars, but we don't have any left-moving in this state.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> meaning from tau to h (with tau < h). Then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo for the car (-6, -17, right, 6): \n  At t1=10: tau = -17, h = -6? But that would be [ -17, -6 ] at turn 10. Then at turn T: [ -17 + 6*(T-10), -6 + 6*(T-10) ].\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \n  Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> so tau is the tail (leftmost) and h is the head (rightmost). But in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So the first number is head, second is tail? That would be inconsistent because for a right-moving car, the head is at the right, so head > tail. But here, for the first car on freeway 1: head=-6, tail=-17 -> so head > tail? Yes, -6 > -17.\n\nSo the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, head is the right end and tail is the left end. So the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-17, -6].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we would have head at the left and tail at the right? But we don't have any left-moving.\n\nNow, let's list all cars at turn 10 (t1=10):\n\nFreeway 1:\n  car1: (head=-6, tail=-17, right, 6) -> span at 10: [-17, -6]\n  car2: (head=-42, tail=-53, right, 6) -> span: [-53, -42]\n  car3: (head=36, tail=25, right, 6) -> wait, head=36, tail=25? Then head>tail -> that's consistent. Span: [25,36]\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h] and tau is the tail? So the car is from tail to head. So for car3: tail=25, head=36 -> [25,36].\n\nBut note: the representation in the table is (head, tail, ...). So we are given (head, tail) and then direction and speed.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2:\n  one car: (head=24, tail=-11, right, 36) -> so tail=-11, head=24 -> span: [-11,24] at t1=10.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: each has two cars:\n  car1: (head=12, tail=1, right, 6) -> span: [1,12] at t1=10.\n  car2: (head=60, tail=49, right, 6) -> span: [49,60] at t1=10.\n\nWe are starting at (0,3) at turn 10. So at turn 10, we are on freeway 3? But wait, the player is at (0,3) at turn 10, meaning at the start of turn 10 we are at freeway 3? Then we are about to choose an action for turn 10.\n\nBut we must check: at turn 10, is there a car on freeway 3 that has 0 in its span? \n  Freeway 3 at turn 10: \n    car1: [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]\n    car2: [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n  So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, we are on freeway 3 and safe.\n\nOur goal: reach (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can only move up, down, or stay. We start at y=3 and need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves if there were no cars would be 6 moves up (each U increases y by 1). But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions from turn 10 onward.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn, starting at turn 10, at y=3.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if there is a car on freeway k at turn T that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe'll compute the positions of the cars for each freeway at each future turn relative to t1=10.\n\nNote: the cars move continuously in the x-direction. We are only concerned when the span covers x=0.\n\nWe'll create a function that for a given freeway k and a turn T (relative to 10, so T=10,11,12,...) returns whether there is a car on k at T that covers x=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (for a range of T we care about) the collision status.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, we can try to go up as fast as possible and check for collisions.\n\nThe minimal H: we start at turn 10, and we want to be at y=9 at the end of turn (10 + H - 1). So we need to go from y=3 to y=9: 6 steps up. So H_min = 6? But we might have to wait (use S) or even go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut note: we are at y=3 at the start of turn 10. Then we do actions at turns 10, 11, ... until we reach y=9 at the end of some turn.\n\nWe need to reach exactly at the end of a turn. So if we do U at turn 10: y=4 at turn 11 (start of turn 11 we are at y=4). Then U at 11: y=5 at turn 12, ... until we do 6 U's: then at the end of turn 15 (which is the start of turn 16) we would be at y=9? \n\nLet me index:\n\nAt turn 10: we start at y=3.\nAfter action a10 (at the end of turn10): we are at y = 3 + delta(a10) -> this becomes the position at the start of turn11.\n\nSo:\n  Start of turn10: y=3\n  After a10: y11 = 3 + delta(a10) -> and this is the state for the start of turn11.\n\nSimilarly, at the start of turn (10+H-1) we are at some y, then we take an action and at the start of turn (10+H) we are at y=9? But we want to have y=9 at the end of the last turn? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn (t1+H-1). \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1: so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then after H actions, we are at turn t1+H. But the position after the last action is at turn t1+H. However, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, note: the action at time t affects the position at time t+1. So:\n  y_{t1} is the starting position at turn t1 (given).\n  Then we take a_{t1}: then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1})\n  Then at turn t1+1, we take a_{t1+1}: then y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + delta(a_{t1+1})\n  ...\n  After H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum_{i=0}^{H-1} delta(a_{t1+i})\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nBut note: the action a_{t1+t} is taken at time t1+t, which will update the position to y_{t1+t+1}. So after the action at time t1+t, we are at y_{t1+t+1}.\n\nSo the last action is taken at time t1+H-1, which updates the position to y_{t1+H}. However, we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? That would be the position at the start of turn t1+H-1, before taking the last action.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then in the answer format: the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the player position is updated after each action. So after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the player is at y_{t1+H}. So to have the player at (0,9) after the entire sequence, we must have y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is not what we want.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". That is a direct quote. \n\nBut that would mean that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action for turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But the update rule: at the end of turn t, we are at y_{t+1}. So at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nThis discrepancy is critical.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nBut in the update rule: the position at the end of turn t is y_{t+1}. So if we want the player to be at 9 at the end of the last turn, then we need y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the index of the turn is defined differently. Let me see the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... so the state y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t.\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? Then we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action and move away? That doesn't make sense.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9). So we must be at (0,9) at some point. The problem says \"reach (0,9)\". \n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the example in the problem? There is no example. But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there might be a misindexing. The minimal H should be the number of turns we take actions. We start at turn t1, and we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the final position is y_{t1+H}. We require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps H is defined as the number of turns including the starting turn? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1, so H turns? \n\nBut then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and the position after that action is y_{t1+H}. So to be at 9, we need y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nI suspect a typo. Because the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and the update is that we are at (0,y) at the start of a turn. But we are moving vertically. The horizontal position is always 0.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll assume that we require the player to be at (0,9) at the start of a turn. So we need to be at y=9 at the start of some turn T. \n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So that would be at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\nBut then we are required to take an action at that turn? And then we move away? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence of H actions should bring us to y=9 at the start of turn t1+H. But the problem explicitly states the condition on y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nI think I found the issue: in the problem, the sequence is for actions from t=0 to H-1, and then the turn at which we are done is turn t1+H-1? But the player position at the end of the sequence is at turn t1+H.\n\nTo clarify, let me denote:\n\n- Turn t1 (start): y = 3.\n- After action at t1 (turn10): we get y11 = y10 + delta(a10) -> and this is the state for the start of turn11.\n\nWe want to be at 9 at the start of turn? Then we need the start of turn T to have y_T=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at the start of turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. This is the state at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo after H-1 actions, we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 (the last action) and move to y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about that? We only care that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThat would be a natural interpretation: we want to be at (0,9) at the start of a turn, and then we stop. But the sequence includes an action for that turn? \n\nThe problem says: we are to find a sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But then we move away. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and the final position is after the last action, which is at the start of turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nGiven the text, I think we have to satisfy y_{t1+H-1}=9. That means that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take the last action a_{t1+H-1} which might move us away, but the problem doesn't require us to stay at 9? It only requires that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut that seems odd. However, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and if we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we have reached it. The action we take at that turn might move us away, but we are allowed to do so? \n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), and then we stop? The problem doesn't say we stop; it says we take a sequence of actions and then after the sequence we have reached 9 at the start of that turn.\n\nTo reconcile, perhaps we don't require to stay at 9; we only require to be there at the start of one turn. But then why take an action after that? \n\nAlternatively, the sequence might be exactly the actions until we are at 9 at the start of a turn, and then we take no further actions. But the sequence includes an action for that turn? \n\nThe problem defines the sequence for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So if at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, then we still have to take an action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we want to stay at 9, we can choose S (stay) at that turn. Then we remain at 9 at the start of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require us to stay; it only requires that we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then even if we move away at the action of turn t1+H-1, we have met the condition.\n\nHowever, that would be a very strange requirement. Typically, we want to be at the goal and stop.\n\nGiven the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9, I think we must be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn (which is the last action in the sequence) and then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta(a_{t1+H-1}), which might not be 9.\n\nBut that doesn't match \"reach (0,9)\" and stop.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. I'll assume that we require to be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H, after the last action. That is, after taking the sequence of H actions, we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H.\n\nThis is the natural interpretation: we start at turn t1 at y=3, take H actions, and then at the start of turn t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nSo then we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the number of turns H is the number of actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll follow the problem literally: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo for H turns of actions, we require that at the start of the last turn of action (turn t1+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nThen we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta(a_{t1+H-1}), which might be 8,9, or 10 (but clamped).\n\nBut the goal is achieved at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the minimal H is the number of actions we take.\n\nHow many actions are needed to go from y=3 to y=9? The minimal number of actions is 6 (all U's) if there are no cars. With cars, we might need more.\n\nBut note: we start at y=3 at turn10 (start). We take action at turn10, then at turn11 start we are at y4 = 3 + delta(a10). Then at turn11 start we are at y4, then take action a11, and so on.\n\nWe want at the start of turn T to be at y=9. Let T = t1 + H - 1 = 10 + H - 1.\n\nSo we start at turn10 at y=3, and we want at the start of turn (10+H-1) to be at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions taken: from turn10 to turn (10+H-2)? Because the last action is at turn (10+H-1)? This doesn't match.\n\nLet me index H:\n\n- H=1: then the sequence has one action: a_{10} (since t=0: a_{t1+0}=a10). Then the condition is y_{t1+1-1}=y_{10}=3, but we want 9 -> not achieved.\n\n- H=2: actions at turn10 and turn11. Then the condition is y_{10+2-1}=y_{11}=9. \n  How to achieve: \n      at turn10 start: y10=3.\n      after a10: y11 = 3 + delta(a10)\n      then at turn11 start: y11 must be 9.\n\n  So we need delta(a10)=6 -> but we can only do +1, -1, or 0. So impossible.\n\n- H=3: actions at turn10,11,12. Condition: y_{10+3-1}=y_{12}=9.\n      y10=3\n      a10: y11 = 3 + d1\n      a11: y12 = y11 + d2 = 3 + d1 + d2\n      require 3+d1+d2=9 -> d1+d2=6 -> possible with two U's? But each U is +1, so two U's give +2, not 6.\n\nWe need to have at the start of turn (10+H-1) we are at 9. The actions we take are from turn10 to turn10+H-1.\n\nThe state at the start of turn10 is given: y10=3.\n\nAfter action at turn10: y11 = 3 + delta(a10)\n\nAfter action at turn11: y12 = y11 + delta(a11) = 3 + d10 + d11\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn (10+H-2): y_{10+H-1} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} delta(a_{10+i})\n\nAnd we require y_{10+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo 3 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} delta(a_{10+i}) = 9 -> sum = 6.\n\nThe actions are taken from i=0 to H-2 (which is H-1 actions) to get to the state at the start of turn10+H-1. But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so including an action at turn10+H-1.\n\nSo we have:\n  Actions: a10, a11, ..., a_{10+H-1} -> H actions.\n  But the state at the start of turn10+H-1 depends on the first H-1 actions.\n\nThen at turn10+H-1, we take an action a_{10+H-1} and then we go to y_{10+H} = y_{10+H-1} + delta(a_{10+H-1}) = 9 + delta(a_{10+H-1}).\n\nSo the condition is that after the first H-1 actions, we are at 9 at the start of turn10+H-1, and then we take the last action at that turn.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of actions (H) must be at least 6+1 = 7, because we need 6 net upward moves to go from 3 to 9, and then one additional action at the turn when we are at 9.\n\nBut that additional action might be S (so we stay at 9) or U/D (then we leave).\n\nThe problem only requires to be at 9 at the start of turn10+H-1, not necessarily to stay.\n\nSo technically, we could do 6 upward moves in the first 6 actions, then at the start of turn16 we are at 9, and then we take any action at turn16 (the 7th action) and then we are at 10 or 8 or 9 (if we choose S).\n\nBut the requirement is only for the start of turn16.\n\nHowever, the minimal H might be achieved without waiting? We might be able to reach at the start of an earlier turn.\n\nLet's calculate the earliest turn at which we can be at 9.\n\nWe start at turn10 at y=3.\n\nEach upward move increases y by 1. So the earliest we can be at 9 is after 6 upward moves, which would be at the start of turn16.\n\nHow? \n  Start turn10: y=3\n  a10=U -> start turn11: y=4\n  a11=U -> start turn12: y=5\n  a12=U -> start turn13: y=6\n  a13=U -> start turn14: y=7\n  a14=U -> start turn15: y=8\n  a15=U -> start turn16: y=9\n\nSo at the start of turn16, we are at 9. Then we need to take an action at turn16. So the sequence has 6 actions (from turn10 to turn15) and then one more action at turn16? But then H=7 actions: turns 10 to 16 (which are 7 actions).\n\nBut the condition is that we require y_{10+H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, at the start of turn16 (which is turn index 16) we are at 9. So 10+H-1 = 16 -> H-1 = 6 -> H=7.\n\nSo with H=7, we achieve y_{16}=9 at the start of turn16, and then we take a16.\n\nSo minimal H without any waiting or detour is 7.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions at each turn.\n\nAt each turn T (from 10 to 16), when we are at freeway y_T at the start of turn T, we must ensure that at turn T, there is no car on freeway y_T that covers 0.\n\nIn the direct path: we are on freeway 3 at turn10, then 4 at turn11, then 5 at turn12, then 6 at turn13, then 7 at turn14, then 8 at turn15, then 9 at turn16.\n\nBut freeway 9 has no cars, so turn16 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check for turns 10 to 15 on freeways 3 to 8.\n\nWe already did turn10 on freeway3: safe.\n\nTurn11: we are on freeway4 at the start of turn11. We must check freeway4 at turn11.\n\nFreeway4 has two cars: \n  car1: (head=12, tail=1, right, 6) at turn10 -> span at turn10: [1,12]\n  car2: (head=60, tail=49, right, 6) -> [49,60]\n\nAt turn11: \n  car1: [1+6*(11-10), 12+6*(1)] = [7,18]\n  car2: [49+6, 60+6] = [55,66]\n\n0 is not in [7,18] or [55,66] -> safe.\n\nTurn12: freeway5 at turn12.\n  Freeway5 cars: same as freeway4? \n    car1: [1+6*(12-10)=1+12=13, 12+12=24] -> [13,24]\n    car2: [49+12=61, 60+12=72] -> [61,72]\n  0 not in either -> safe.\n\nTurn13: freeway6 at turn13.\n  car1: [1+6*(13-10)=1+18=19, 12+18=30] -> [19,30]\n  car2: [49+18=67, 60+18=78] -> [67,78]\n  safe.\n\nTurn14: freeway7 at turn14.\n  car1: [1+6*4=25, 12+24=36] -> [25,36]\n  car2: [49+24=73, 60+24=84] -> [73,84]\n  safe.\n\nTurn15: freeway8 at turn15.\n  car1: [1+6*5=31, 12+30=42] -> [31,42]\n  car2: [49+30=79, 60+30=90] -> [79,90]\n  safe.\n\nAnd turn16: freeway9, no cars -> safe.\n\nSo the direct path with 6 U's and then one S (or any) at the last turn works.\n\nBut we need 7 actions: \n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U  -> after this, at start of turn16: y=9.\n  turn16: ? \n\nThe last action at turn16 can be anything, but to be safe and not move away, we can choose S.\n\nBut the problem only requires to be at 9 at the start of turn16, and then we take an action. We don't require to stay. But if we choose U, we go to 10 which is out of bounds? The update clamps to [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and choose U, we stay at 9? \n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and then clamped to [0,9]. \n\nSo at turn16, if we are at 9 and choose U: y17 = min(9+1,9)=9? Or max(min(9+1,9),0) -> 9. So it stays.\n\nSimilarly, D: 9-1=8, then we leave 9.\n\nS: stays at 9.\n\nSo to stay at 9, we can choose U or S. D would move down to 8.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require to stay, so we can choose any.\n\nNow, is there a way to achieve being at 9 earlier? \n\nWe require at the start of turn (10+H-1)=9.\n\nFor H=6: then 10+6-1=15. So we want at the start of turn15 to be at 9.\n\nCurrently, we are at turn10: y=3. We have 5 actions from turn10 to turn14 to change y.\n\nThe net change must be +6. But 5 actions can give at most +5 (if all U). So we can only reach y=8 at the start of turn15. Not 9.\n\nFor H=7: we require at start of turn16 to be at 9, which we can achieve with 6 U's in the first 6 actions (turns10 to15).\n\nIs there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? For example, at turn15? But then we would need net +6 in 5 actions: impossible.\n\nAt turn16 is the earliest possible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut are there any collisions on the direct path? We checked and there are none.\n\nHowever, we must check freeway3 at turn10, freeway4 at turn11, etc., which we did, and they are safe.\n\nBut what about freeway2 and freeway1? We are not on them in the direct path.\n\nIn the direct path, we only go through freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo we don't need to worry about freeway1 and 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's look at freeway2:\n\nFreeway2 has one car: (head=24, tail=-11, right, 36) at turn10: span=[-11,24]\n\nAt turn10: 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, so if we were on freeway2 at turn10, it would be a collision. But we are on freeway3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 has three cars. The first car at turn10: [-17,-6] -> 0 not in there. Second car: [-53,-42] -> not. Third car: [25,36] -> not. So freeway1 is safe at turn10? But we are not on it.\n\nNow, the car on freeway2 at turn11: \n  span = [-11+36*(1), 24+36*(1)] = [25,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut we are not on freeway2 at any turn in our path.\n\nSo the direct path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, and the actions are:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: S (or U, but S is natural)\n\nBut note: the last action (Turn16) is required by the sequence (H=7 actions) and we are at 9 at the start of turn16, then we do S to stay.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nt1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut wait, H=7, so the last turn is t1+6=16? Yes.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut let me confirm the turn indices: \n  t=0: a_{10}\n  t=1: a_{11}\n  ...\n  t=6: a_{16}\n\nSo yes.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that at each turn we are safe.\n\nWe already did:\n\nTurn10: freeway3 -> safe (0 not in any car's span at turn10 on freeway3)\nTurn11: freeway4 -> at turn11: car1: [7,18], car2: [55,66] -> safe.\nTurn12: freeway5: [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe.\nTurn13: freeway6: [19,30] and [67,78] -> safe.\nTurn14: freeway7: [25,36] and [73,84] -> safe.\nTurn15: freeway8: [31,42] and [79,90] -> safe.\nTurn16: freeway9: no cars -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut what about freeway1 and 2? We are not on them.\n\nHowever, there is a car on freeway2 at turn10: [ -11, 24] -> which does include 0. So if we were on freeway2 at turn10, it would be a collision. But we are on freeway3.\n\nSimilarly, at turn11 on freeway2: [25,60] -> safe.\n\nBut we are never on freeway2.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: the player might be tempted to take a shortcut by moving down to freeway2? But that would be dangerous at turn10. And freeway2 might be safe at later turns? But we don't need to go there.\n\nWe are going up and the direct path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 earlier? We saw that with 6 actions we can only get to 8 at the start of turn16? \n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nWe require to be at 9 at the start of turn T, where T = 10 + H - 1.\n\nThe number of actions taken from turn10 to turn T-1 is T-10.\n\nThe net change in y is from 3 to 9: +6.\n\nEach action can give at most +1. So the minimal number of actions is 6, so T-10 >= 6 -> T>=16.\n\nThen T = 16 -> 10+H-1=16 -> H=7.\n\nSo yes, minimal H is 7.\n\nThus, the answer is the sequence of 7 actions: 6 U's and then one S.\n\nBut we can also do 6 U's and then a U (which would still leave us at 9 because of clamping) or D (which would move to 8). But S is the natural choice.\n\nSo we choose S for the last action.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, starting from (0, 3) at turn 10, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) required is 7, as it takes at least 6 upward moves to increase the y-coordinate from 3 to 9, and one additional turn to be at y=9 at the start of turn 16 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 7 - 1 = 16\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- Turns 10 to 15: Move upward (U) each turn to increase the y-coordinate by 1 per turn.\n- Turn 16: Stay (S) to remain at y=9 (though any action is acceptable as the requirement is met at the start of turn 16).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 10 (y=3)**: Freeway 3 cars:  \n  - Car 1: [1, 12] at turn 10 → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: [49, 60] at turn 10 → 0 not in span.  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 11 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 cars:  \n  - Car 1: [1 + 6(11-10) = 7, 12 + 6(1) = 18] → [7, 18] → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: [49 + 6(1) = 55, 60 + 6(1) = 66] → [55, 66] → 0 not in span.  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 12 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 cars:  \n  - Car 1: [1 + 6(12-10) = 13, 12 + 6(2) = 24] → [13, 24] → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: [49 + 6(2) = 61, 60 + 6(2) = 72] → [61, 72] → 0 not in span.  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 13 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 cars:  \n  - Car 1: [1 + 6(13-10) = 19, 12 + 6(3) = 30] → [19, 30] → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: [49 + 6(3) = 67, 60 + 6(3) = 78] → [67, 78] → 0 not in span.  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 14 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 cars:  \n  - Car 1: [1 + 6(14-10) = 25, 12 + 6(4) = 36] → [25, 36] → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: [49 + 6(4) = 73, 60 + 6(4) = 84] → [73, 84] → 0 not in span.  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 15 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 cars:  \n  - Car 1: [1 + 6(15-10) = 31, 12 + 6(5) = 42] → [31, 42] → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: [49 + 6(5) = 79, 60 + 6(5) = 90] → [79, 90] → 0 not in span.  \n  Safe.\n- **Turn 16 (y=9)**: Freeway 9 has no cars → Safe.\n\nThe direct upward path is collision-free, and no shorter sequence is possible (since 5 moves can only reach y=8 at turn 15).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn t1=11 to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn T. The key point is that when you move, you're only on the new freeway starting from the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive on y+1 at turn T+1. That means you don't get hit by cars on y+1 at turn T, only at turn T+1 when you're there.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states. For each freeway, I need to know where the cars are at any future turn based on their initial positions at t1=11.\n\nThe car update is given: for left-moving, span moves left, for right-moving, span moves right with speed s per turn.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, cars are: (0, -11, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nDirection is \"right\", so they are moving right. But for right-moving, the span is given as [tail, head] I think? Let me see.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1, it says (0, -11, right, 6). So for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [τ, h] with τ = -11 and h = 0? But -11 to 0, that would be from left to right, but since it's moving right, the head is at 0, tail at -11.\n\nSimilarly, (-36, -47, right, 6): if head and tail, -36 to -47? That might be a mistake, because -47 is less than -36, so if it's moving right, head should be larger.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for each car, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), where h is head, τ is tail.\n\nFor direction: if d is right, it's moving right, so at time T, head moves to h + s(T-t1), tail to τ + s(T-t1).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head to h - s(T-t1), tail to τ - s(T-t1).\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, and for freeway 1, first car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6.\n\nSo at t1=11, span is from τ=-11 to h=0.\n\nSince moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-11), h + s(T-11)] = [-11 + 6(T-11), 0 + 6(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6. But h=-36, τ=-47, since -47 < -36, so tail is at -47, head at -36? That seems odd because usually head is forward, but since it's moving right, head should be on the right, so if τ=-47, h=-36, that means the car is from x=-47 to x=-36, so head at -36, tail at -47, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, third car: h=42, τ=31, d=right, s=6. τ=31, h=42, so from 31 to 42, head at 42.\n\nNow for other freeways, it's similar.\n\nBut look at freeway 2: only one car: (60, 25, right, 36). h=60, τ=25, so from 25 to 60? But 25 to 60 is 35 units, but with speed 36, which is fast.\n\nThen for freeways 3 to 8, all have: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: cars (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 4,5,6,7,8 all same.\n\nFirst, I need to find when 0 is occupied for each freeway at each turn, to avoid being there at that turn.\n\nSince the player starts at y=4, and needs to go to y=9, which is above, so probably moving up is the way, but I need to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9 I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. y=0 is the bottom, y=9 is top, I assume.\n\nPlayer position y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,4), which is on freeway y=4? No, at position (0,y), so when y=4, it's on freeway 4.\n\nBut at turn t1=11, player is at (0,4), so on freeway 4.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), which is not on any freeway, so once at y=9, it's safe.\n\nBut during the path, when on y=1 to 8, need to avoid when cars are at x=0.\n\nNow, since moving takes time, and actions affect when you arrive.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nA car occupies x=0 at time T if for some car on that freeway, 0 is in [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving, or similar for left, but all are right-moving here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, as per data.\n\nSo for a car with head h, tail τ, speed s, right-moving, it occupies x at time T if τ + s(T-t1) ≤ x ≤ h + s(T-t1)\n\nSince it's moving right, the span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nx=0 is occupied if min(τ + sΔT, h + sΔT) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + sΔT, h + sΔT), but since it's a span, and for right-moving, if τ < h, then the interval is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so 0 is in it if τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT.\n\nSimilarly, if for some reason τ > h, but in this case, for the cars, let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1, first car: h=0, τ=-11, so at t1, span [-11,0], so x=0 is occupied since 0 is the head.\n\nAt T, span [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT] = [6ΔT -11, 6ΔT]\n\nSo 0 is in [6ΔT -11, 6ΔT] if 6ΔT -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 6ΔT, which is always true for ΔT >=0 since 6ΔT -11 <= 6ΔT, and 0 <= 6ΔT for ΔT >=0, but 6ΔT -11 <=0 <=6ΔT.\n\n0 <= 6ΔT implies ΔT >=0, which is true.\n\n6ΔT -11 <=0 implies ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so for ΔT <=1, it holds? Let's solve:\n\n6ΔT -11 <= 0 <= 6ΔT\n\nLeft: 6ΔT -11 <=0 => ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nRight: 0 <= 6ΔT always for ΔT >=0\n\nBut 0 must be >= lower bound and <= upper bound.\n\nSo 6ΔT -11 <= 0 and 0 <= 6ΔT\n\n0 <= 6ΔT is always true for ΔT >=0.\n\n6ΔT -11 <=0 implies ΔT <= 11/6\n\nAlso, since the span is [6ΔT-11, 6ΔT], 0 is in it if min <=0<=max, which since 6ΔT-11 <= 6ΔT, min is 6ΔT-11, max is 6ΔT.\n\nSo 6ΔT-11 <= 0 <= 6ΔT\n\nWhich is equivalent to 0 <= 6ΔT and 6ΔT <= 11? No:\n\nFrom 6ΔT-11 <=0 and 0<=6ΔT, so ΔT <= 11/6 and ΔT >=0.\n\nBut for ΔT > 11/6, 6ΔT-11 >0, so 0 < lower bound, not in span.\n\nFor example, at ΔT=0, span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt ΔT=1, span [6*1-11, 6*1] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=2, span [12-11,12] = [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in [1,12], so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=1.833, span [11-11,11] = [0,11], 0 included.\n\nΔT=1.834, span [11.004-11,11.004] = [0.004,11.004], 0 not in if 0<0.004.\n\nBut since turns are integer, ΔT integer, for ΔT=0,1: occupied, ΔT=2 and above: not.\n\nΔT=0: T=11, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=1: T=12, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=2: T=13, span [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSecond car on freeway 1: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6, right-moving.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? h=-36, τ=-47, so if tail τ, head h, with τ=-47, h=-36, so span from -47 to -36.\n\nAt T, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if -47+6ΔT <= 0 <= -36+6ΔT\n\nNow, -47+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=47 => ΔT <=47/6≈7.833\n\n0 <= -36+6ΔT => 6ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7.833, i.e., ΔT=6,7\n\nAt ΔT=6, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt ΔT=7, span [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt ΔT=5, span [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nΔT=8, span [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nThird car on freeway 1: h=42, τ=31, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [31 +6ΔT, 42 +6ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if 31+6ΔT <=0 <=42+6ΔT\n\nBut 31+6ΔT >=31 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= 31+6ΔT always, but 31+6ΔT <=0 is impossible since min is 31, so never occupied, 0 is always less than lower bound.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied when:\n\n- First car: ΔT=0,1 (T=11,12)\n\n- Second car: ΔT=6,7 (T=17,18)\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall, freeway 1 occupied at T=11,12,17,18\n\nT=11 and 12 from first car, T=17 and 18 from second car.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (60,25,right,36) so h=60, τ=25, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 36ΔT, 60 + 36ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if 25+36ΔT <=0 <=60+36ΔT\n\n25+36ΔT <=0? But 25+36ΔT >=25>0, so impossible, 0 not in span ever, since lower bound at least 25.\n\nSo freeway 2 never occupied at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=18, τ=7, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [7 +6ΔT, 18 +6ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if 7+6ΔT <=0 <=18+6ΔT\n\n7+6ΔT <=0? 6ΔT <= -7, impossible since ΔT>=0, so never.\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\nτ=-59, h=-48\n\nSpan at T: [-59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\nx=0 occupied if -59+6ΔT <=0 <= -48+6ΔT\n\n-59+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/6≈9.833\n\n0 <= -48+6ΔT => 6ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=8\n\nSo for ΔT=8,9\n\nAt ΔT=8, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=9, span [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=10, span [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 3, occupied only by second car at T=19,20 (since ΔT=8,9, T=t1+ΔT=11+8=19, 11+9=20)\n\nt1=11, ΔT=8, T=19; ΔT=9, T=20\n\nNow, similarly for freeway 4 to 8, all have the same cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSo for each of y=4,5,6,7,8, the occupancy at x=0 is the same as freeway 3.\n\nFor freeway 4: cars (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst car: span [7+6ΔT,18+6ΔT], min 7>0, so never at 0.\n\nSecond car: span [-59+6ΔT, -48+6ΔT], occupied when -59+6ΔT <=0 <= -48+6ΔT, so ΔT>=8 and ΔT<=9.833, so ΔT=8,9, T=19,20.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut for freeway 4, at t1=11, player is on it, since y=4.\n\nAt T=11, for freeway 4, is it occupied? At ΔT=0, second car span [-59, -48], 0 not in, since -48 to -59, both negative, 0 > -48? Span [-59,-48], so from -59 to -48, all negative, 0 not <= -48? Lower bound -59, upper bound -48, so -59 <= x <= -48, 0 > -48, not in interval. Similarly, first car [7,18], 0 not in. So at T=11, freeway 4 not occupied, so player is safe at start.\n\nNow, summary for each freeway, times when x=0 occupied:\n\n- y=1: T=11,12,17,18\n\n- y=2: never\n\n- y=3: T=19,20\n\n- y=4: T=19,20\n\n- y=5: T=19,20\n\n- y=6: T=19,20\n\n- y=7: T=19,20\n\n- y=8: T=19,20\n\ny=3 to 8 all occupied at T=19,20.\n\ny=2 never occupied.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at T=11.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and no cars.\n\nPlayer can move U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y for the next turn.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAnd at turn T, player is on freeway y_T (if between 1 and 8), and must not have collision, meaning that for freeway y_T, at time T, x=0 not occupied.\n\nThen at turn T+1, player is on y_{T+1}.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=4, need to go up 5 steps, so minimum 5 turns if moving up each turn, but may need to wait or avoid.\n\ny=9 is safe, so once at y=9, done.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for the actions, starting from turn t1.\n\nPlayer at turn t1 is at position, and we apply actions for t= t1 to t1+H-1, and after H turns, at turn t1+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nDefine turns.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd we need to be safe at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, since at turn t1+H, if y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAt turn T, if 1<= y_T <=8, then must not have collision on that freeway at time T.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no issue.\n\nStart: turn t1=11, y=4.\n\nWe need to find actions a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., up to when y=9.\n\nMin H.\n\nSince y=2 is always safe, no cars at x=0 ever.\n\ny=1 has dangers at T=11,12,17,18.\n\nBut we start at y=4, which is safe at T=11, but will be dangerous at T=19,20.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 to 8 dangerous at T=19,20.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nTo go from 4 to 9, we can go up directly, but need to check the path.\n\nSince we can move down or stay, but moving down might not help, since we need to go up.\n\nBut we might need to wait to avoid the danger times.\n\nList the dangerous turns for relevant freeways.\n\nFreeway y=1: danger at T=11,12,17,18\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: danger T=19,20\n\ny=4: danger T=19,20\n\ny=5: danger T=19,20\n\ny=6: danger T=19,20\n\ny=7: danger T=19,20\n\ny=8: danger T=19,20\n\nPlayer at T=11, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, if we move up directly:\n\nOption 1: always U\n\nTurn 11: a=U, then y12 = 5\n\nBut at turn 11, we are on y=4, which is safe at T=11.\n\nAfter a11=U, at turn 12, we are on y=5.\n\nAt turn 12, we need to be safe on y=5.\n\ny=5 is dangerous only at T=19,20, so at T=12, it is safe, since 12 not 19 or 20.\n\nSimilarly, a12=U, y13=6, at turn 13, on y=6, which is safe at T=13.\n\na13=U, y14=7, safe at T=14.\n\na14=U, y15=8, safe at T=15.\n\na15=U, y16=9, now at turn 16, y=9, safe, and we reached.\n\nBut after a15=U, y16=9, so at turn 16, position is (0,9), so we are done.\n\nNow, how many turns: from turn 11 to turn 16.\n\nActions: turn 11,12,13,14,15: 5 actions.\n\nH=5, sequence: U,U,U,U,U\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nAt each turn T, y_T, and freeway if applicable.\n\nTurn 11: T=11, y=4, freeway 4, occupied? At T=11, freeway 4 not occupied, as we saw earlier, safe.\n\nTurn 12: T=12, y=5, freeway 5, at T=12, is it occupied? Freeway 5 dangerous only at T=19,20, so T=12 safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 13: T=13, y=6, freeway 6, safe at T=13.\n\nTurn 14: T=14, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nTurn 15: T=15, y=8, freeway 8, at T=15, dangerous? Freeway 8 dangerous at T=19,20, not 15, so safe.\n\nThen after a15=U, at turn 16, y=9, not on freeway, done.\n\nBut at turn 15, we are on y=8, and action U, so we move to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nIn turn 15, we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nIs there any problem with y=1 or others? No, since we are not on them.\n\nBut in this path, we go through y=5,6,7,8 at times 12,13,14,15, all before 19, so safe.\n\nCould we have done it faster? From y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 moves up, so H=5 is minimum possible, since each U increases y by 1, and we need +5.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=5 should be achievable and minimal.\n\nBut is there a collision at some point?\n\nIn the sequence above, all seems safe.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8 at T=15.\n\nFreeway 8: cars same as others, occupied only at T=19,20, so at T=15, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut what about the start? At T=11, y=4, freeway 4: cars (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nAt T=11, ΔT=0, first car span [7,18], not include 0.\n\nSecond car span [-59,-48], not include 0, so safe.\n\nAt T=12, y=5, freeway 5: same cars, at T=12, ΔT=1, first car span [7+6,18+6]=[13,24], not 0.\n\nSecond car span [-59+6,-48+6]=[-53,-42], not 0. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=13, y=6: ΔT=2, first car [7+12,18+12]=[19,30], no\n\nSecond car [-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36], no. Safe.\n\nT=14, y=7: ΔT=3, first car [7+18,18+18]=[25,36], no\n\nSecond car [-59+18,-48+18]=[-41,-30], no. Safe.\n\nT=15, y=8: ΔT=4, first car [7+24,18+24]=[31,42], no\n\nSecond car [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], no. Safe.\n\nThen turn 15 action U, y16=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 5 turns.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? No, since H=5 is min.\n\nBut let's see if at some point we might be forced to wait, but in this case no.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=1 and y=2, but we didn't go there.\n\nAnother thing: the player could go to y=2 which is always safe, but since we are at y=4 and need to go to y=9, going down to y=2 would take extra moves, so not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, staying still might be needed if we hit danger, but in this path, no danger encountered.\n\nBut let's check if for freeway 4, at T=11, we are safe, but if we had stayed, at T=12, on y=4, but at T=12, freeway 4: ΔT=1, cars: first [13,24], no; second [-53,-42], no, safe. But if we stay, we waste time, not better.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut in this case, with U,U,U,U,U, we reach in 5 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence for turns starting from t1=11.\n\nIn the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn 11: a_{11}\n\nTurn 12: a_{12}\n\netc.\n\nWith a=U for all.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, when we move, for example at turn 11, we are on y=4, action U, so at turn 11, we are on y=4, and we move to y=5 for turn 12.\n\nAt turn 11, we are only on y=4, so cars on y=5 don't affect us at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, we are on y=5, action U, move to y=6 for turn 13, so at turn 12, only on y=5, not affected by y=6 cars.\n\nAnd since in our path, at each turn, the current freeway is safe, no issue.\n\nSuppose at some turn we move to a freeway that is dangerous at that time, but since we arrive at next turn, it might be ok if not dangerous then.\n\nBut in this case, not needed.\n\nFor example, suppose we wanted to go to y=8 at T=19, but at T=19, y=8 is dangerous, so we cannot be on y=8 at T=19.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=8 at T=15, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? No, 5 is min.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 1 at T=17,18, but we are not on y=1.\n\nAnother thing: the player could go to y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is below, not helpful.\n\ny=9 is goal.\n\nSo I think H=5 with all U is fine.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 1, there is a car at T=17,18, but since we are at higher y, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3 to 8, danger at T=19,20, but we pass before that.\n\nIn our sequence, we are at y=9 by T=16, before T=19.\n\nT=16 is before 19.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=11\n\nAfter action a11 at turn 11, y12 position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position.\n\nIn this case, actions at turn 11,12,13,14,15: H=5 actions.\n\nAfter a15, at turn 16, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start later, but that would increase H, not minimize.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut is there a constraint that forces us to take more turns? I don't think so.\n\nAnother point: at turn 11, if we do nothing, stay, then at turn 12, y=4 still.\n\nBut then at turn 12, on y=4, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen we can move up, but it would take more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we stay at turn 11, then y12=4, then a12=U, y13=5, and so on, up to a15=U, y16=8, then a16=U, y17=9, so 6 actions, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo down to y=2, which is safe, but then need to come back, more moves.\n\nFor example, from y=4, go down to y=2: a11=D, y12=3; a12=D, y13=2? y from 4, D to 3, then D to 2.\n\nAt turn 11, a11=D, y12=3\n\nThen at turn 12, on y=3, which at T=12 is safe? Freeway 3 dangerous at T=19,20, not 12, so safe.\n\nThen a12=D, y13=2\n\nAt turn 13, on y=2, which is always safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9: need to go from 2 to 9, +7, so 7 moves up, but more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be all U for 5 turns.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn t1=11: U\n\nTurn t1+1=12: U\n\nTurn t1+2=13: U\n\nTurn t1+3=14: U\n\nTurn t1+4=15: U\n\nAfter that, at turn t1+5=16, y=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n}\n\nBut the sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 + 0} = a_{11}\n\nt=1: a_{12}\n\n...\n\nt=4: a_{15} for H=5.\n\nThen positions: after a11, y12; ... after a15, y16=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, there is a car with (42,31,right,6), but we didn't care.\n\nBut all seems fine.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 2, there is a car with high speed, but never at x=0, so safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and in the path, we are on y=4,5,6,7,8 at turns 11,12,13,14,15, all safe times.\n\nPerhaps at turn 15, if we were on y=8 at a later time, but we are not.\n\nSuppose we delay, for example, if we stay at y=4 until after T=20, but that would be later, not minimal.\n\nFor instance, at turn 11, S, y12=4; turn 12, S, y13=4; ... until after T=20, but T=20 is turn 20, so we need to stay until turn 21 or something, then move up, but that would be many turns, not minimal.\n\nSo no need.\n\nThus, minimal H=5 with all U.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the boxed format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 11: a_{11} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: a_{12} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: a_{13} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: a_{14} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: a_{15} = U\n}\n\nIn the sequence, it's up to turn t1+H-1 =11+5-1=15, yes.\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nPerhaps write the actions without the subscripts, but I think with subscripts is fine.\n\nThe format says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs if, at any turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)\nThe occupancy at \\(x = 0\\) for each freeway is determined based on the car states at \\(t_1 = 11\\) and their movement rules (all cars are right-moving). The times when \\(x = 0\\) is occupied for each freeway are:\n- **Freeway 1**: Occupied at turns 11, 12, 17, 18.\n- **Freeway 2**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeways 3 to 8**: Occupied at turns 19 and 20.\n\n### Path to (0, 9) with Minimal Turns\nThe player begins at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 11. The goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\), which requires a net increase of 5 in the y-coordinate. Each \"U\" action increases y by 1, so the minimum number of turns is 5 if moving up (\"U\") at every turn. The following sequence is feasible and avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 11, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4): Safe, as freeway 4 is not occupied at turn 11.\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) for turn 12.\n- At turn 12, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5): Safe, as freeway 5 is not occupied at turn 12 (only at 19 and 20).\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 13.\n- At turn 13, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6): Safe, as freeway 6 is not occupied at turn 13.\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 14.\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7): Safe, as freeway 7 is not occupied at turn 14.\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 15.\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8): Safe, as freeway 8 is not occupied at turn 15 (only at 19 and 20).\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe. This sequence uses 5 actions over turns 11 to 15, reaching the goal at turn 16. No shorter sequence is possible, as moving up requires at least 5 steps.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- Actions: \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, S\\}\\) for turns \\(t = 11\\) to \\(15\\).\n- \\(H = 5\\) turns (number of actions).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 11: a_{11} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: a_{12} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: a_{13} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: a_{14} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: a_{15} = U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) at turn 12 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and I collide if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y where there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn. Since the player position changes, I need to consider for each possible y and turn whether it's safe to be there.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=12, and I need to compute for turns after that.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at turn 12.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\n- Car 1: head 6, tail -5, direction right, speed 6. Since direction is right, head is greater than tail? The notation says for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] so head h, tail τ, with h > τ I assume.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd similarly for left: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1, it has (6, -5, right, 6)\n\nSince direction is right, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-5, 6]? But it says (head, tail), so head=6, tail=-5, and direction right, so span should be [tail, head] = [-5, 6] for right-moving? I'm confused.\n\nLet's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" where τ is tail and h is head.\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for (6, -5, right, 6), head=6, tail=-5.\n\nSince direction right, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-5, 6]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ]\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars: (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFor (48, 37, right, 6): head=48, tail=37, so span [τ,h] = [37,48]? τ=37, h=48, so [37,48]\n\nBut direction is right, so [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, (-30, -41, right, 6): head=-30, tail=-41, so span [τ,h] = [-41, -30]\n\nAnd (6,-5,right,6): span [-5,6]\n\nNow freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nhead=-48, tail=-83, dir right, speed 36, span [τ,h] = [-83, -48]\n\nFreeways 3 to 8 all have two cars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFor (24,13,right,6): head=24, tail=13, span [13,24]\n\nFor (-42,-53,right,6): head=-42, tail=-53, span [-53,-42]\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving mentioned.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nThat is, if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) for that car at turn T.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span is [c_low(T), c_high(T)]\n\nThen collision if y_T = k and for some car on k, c_low(T) ≤ 0 ≤ c_high(T)\n\nNow, for right-moving cars, c_low(T) = τ + s(T - t1)\n\nc_high(T) = h + s(T - t1)\n\nSince t1=12.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nAlso, note that if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I only care about the freeway I am on at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), so I am on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nIf I perform action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\nIf I decide to move to a different freeway, at turn T, I am on the old one, and only on the new one at T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo, for turn T, collision depends only on cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\ny_T is the freeway I am on during turn T.\n\nI start at turn t1=12 at y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nSince I start at 5 and need to go to 9, I need to increase y by 4, so minimum turns if no cars would be 4 turns of U, but I might need to wait or avoid cars.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to go slower or detour.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway y=1 to 8, and for each turn T, whether position (0,y) is safe at turn T, meaning that for all cars on y, 0 is not in their span at T.\n\nSince collision is per freeway per turn.\n\nFor a given y and T, it is safe if for every car on that freeway, 0 not in [c_low(T), c_high(T)]\n\nOtherwise unsafe.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to compute for each y, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nThen for the player path, I need a sequence of actions such that for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, the position at that turn is safe, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\ny starts at t1=12, position (0,5)\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H -1, we have y =9? Let's see.\n\nTurn indices: at turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1=12, y_{12}=5.\n\nWe perform actions a_{12}, a_{13}, ..., up to a_{12 + H -1}, and after that, at turn 12 + H, we have y_{12+H}, but we want to reach at turn 12 + H -1? Let's read the task.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions for turns t1 + 0 to t1 + H -1.\n\nThen after action a_{t1 + H -1}, at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H, position is set.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nThe task says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd the sequence is actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing a_t, at time t+1, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSpecifically, T = t1 + H -1.\n\nAnd actions from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor turn t1, position is given, y_{t1} =5.\n\nThen action a_{t1} determines y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at (0,5), which is freeway 5, so we need to check if freeway 5 is safe at turn t1=12.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start to end.\n\nStart turn: t1=12\n\nEnd turn: t1 + H -1\n\nNumber of actions: H\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince we start at y=5, need to go to y=9, net change +4, so with actions, each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0, so minimum H if all U is H=5? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1=12, y=5.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, at turn 13, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}\n\nThen at turn 14, y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13}, and so on.\n\nWe want at turn T = t1 + H -1 = 12 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then T=12 +1 -1=12, so at turn 12, y=9, but we are at y=5, not 9, so impossible.\n\nIf H=2, T=12+2-1=13, y_{13}=9.\n\nBut from y_{12}=5, to y_{13}=9, we need Δy = +4 in one step, but each action changes by at most 1, so impossible to jump multiple steps.\n\nMaximum change per action is 1, so from y=5 to y=9, it takes at least 4 steps up, so minimum 4 actions, each U, but we start at turn 12, position at turn 12 is given.\n\nAt turn 12, y=5.\n\nAfter first action a_{12}, at turn 13, y_{13} =5 + Δy_{12}\n\nAfter second action a_{13}, at turn 14, y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 12+k, y_{12+k} is set.\n\nWe want at turn T= t1 + H -1 =12 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nSet T = 12 + H -1, so when T=12, H=1; T=13, H=2; up to T=12+H-1.\n\nFor y_T=9 with T=12+H-1.\n\nSince we start at turn 12, y=5, and we want to be at y=9 at some turn T >=12.\n\nThe difference in turns: from turn 12 to turn T, there are (T-12) actions performed? Let's think.\n\nFrom turn 12 to turn T, the number of actions is (T - 12).\n\nBecause actions at turns 12,13,14,...,T-1 determine y_{13} to y_T.\n\nAt turn 12, position is given without action.\n\nThen action at turn 12 determines y_{13}, action at turn 13 determines y_{14}, ..., action at turn T-1 determines y_T.\n\nSo to have y_T =9, we need actions from turn 12 to turn T-1, total of (T-12) actions.\n\nThen H = number of actions = T - 12.\n\nBut T = t1 + H -1 =12 + H -1.\n\nSet T = turn when we reach y=9.\n\nThen T = 12 + H -1, so H = T - 11.\n\nSince T = 12 + H -1, so T - 12 = H -1.\n\nNumber of actions H = (T - 12) + 1? Let's clarify.\n\n- Turn 12: start, y=5\n\n- Action a_{12}: determines y_{13}\n\n- Action a_{13}: determines y_{14}\n\n- ...\n\n- Action a_{T-1}: determines y_T\n\nWe want y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{12} to a_{T-1}, total of (T-12) actions.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}, so for t1=12, actions a_{12}, a_{13}, ..., a_{12+H-1}\n\nThen after a_{12+H-1}, at turn (12+H-1) +1 = 12+H, y_{12+H} is set.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 =12 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nAt turn 12 + H -1, position is (0, y_{12+H-1})\n\nWe want y_{12+H-1} =9.\n\nAfter action a_{12+H-1}, y_{12+H} is set, but we don't care about that for the position at turn 12+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions: a_{12}, then at turn 13, y_{13} is set, but position at turn 12+H-1=12+1-1=12 is y_{12}=5, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, actions a_{12} and a_{13}, position at turn 12+2-1=13 is y_{13}, which is set by a_{12}, so we want y_{13}=9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=5, actions a_{12} to a_{16}, position at turn 12+5-1=16 is y_{16}=9.\n\nAnd y_{16} is set by a_{15}, etc.\n\nBut the position at turn 16 is before action a_{16}, I think.\n\nAt each turn t, before action, position is (0,y_t), then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut the collision is checked at turn t for position (0,y_t), with cars on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThen we perform a_t, move to y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nFor turn t, we need (0,y_t) to be safe.\n\nWe start at t=12, y=5, so we need freeway 5 safe at t=12.\n\nThen we go to t=13, y_{13}, need safe at t=13, and so on, until at some turn T, y_T=9 and safe.\n\nT is the turn when we reach, and H is the number of actions to reach that state.\n\nFrom above, for position at turn T to be (0,9), we need actions from turn 12 to turn T-1 to change y from 5 to 9.\n\nThe number of actions is (T - 12), and T = 12 + H -1, so H = T - 11.\n\nSince T = 12 + H -1, then T - 12 = H -1, so number of actions H = (T - 12) + 1? Let's set T as the target turn.\n\nLet T be the turn when y_T =9.\n\nThen T >=12.\n\nNumber of actions needed: from turn 12 to turn T-1, inclusive, that's (T-1) - 12 +1 = T -12 actions.\n\nFor example, T=12, y12=9, but y12=5, not 9, impossible.\n\nT=13, y13=9, actions at turn 12 only, one action.\n\nT=14, y14=9, actions at turn 12 and 13, two actions.\n\nSo for y_T=9, number of actions is T-12.\n\nBut in the sequence, H actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and position at t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nt1+H-1 = T, so T = 12 + H -1.\n\nThen number of actions H = T - 11.\n\nSince T-12 = (T-11) -1, it's messy.\n\nI'll define T as the target turn, with y_T=9, T>=12.\n\nThen actions from turn 12 to T-1, number of actions N = T - 12.\n\nThen H in the problem is N, the number of actions.\n\nAnd the turn for position is T = t1 + H -1 =12 + H -1.\n\nSince t1=12, T=11 + H.\n\nFor example, H=1, T=12, y12=9\n\nH=2, T=13, y13=9\n\nH=3, T=14, y14=9\n\netc.\n\nBut for H=1, T=12, y12 must be 9, but it is 5, so impossible. So min H at least 4, for T=15, y15=9, with 4 actions.\n\nFrom y12=5 to y15=9, with 3 actions? Let's:\n\nAt turn 12, y12=5\n\nAction a12: y13 =5 + dy12\n\nAction a13: y14 = y13 + dy13\n\nAction a14: y15 = y14 + dy14\n\nWe want y15=9, for example.\n\nThen with 3 actions, we can have y15=9 from y12=5, if all U, y13=6, y14=7, y15=8?

-42 <0, and -53< -42, so [-53,-42], all negative, 0 not <= c_high=-42<0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, only unsafe at T=19,20.\n\nSo at T=12, y=5 is safe.\n\nFreeway 6, y=6: same as above, cars identical, unsafe at T=19,20.\n\nFreeway 7, y=7: same, unsafe at T=19,20.\n\nFreeway 8, y=8: same, unsafe at T=19,20.\n\nAll freeways 3 to 8 have the same car configurations: two cars each, with the second one causing unsafe at T=19,20.\n\nAnd the first car always safe.\n\nNow y=1 unsafe at T=12,17,18\n\ny=2 unsafe at T=14\n\ny=3 to 8 unsafe at T=19,20\n\nWe need to go from y=5 at turn 12 to y=9 at some turn T>=16.\n\ny=9 no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 might be safe, but we don't need to go there.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and y=8 is adjacent, etc.\n\nThe only obstacles are at specific turns.\n\nWe start at turn 12, y=5, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by turn 16 at earliest.\n\nBut at turn 16, we can be at y=9.\n\nNow, the path: from y=5 to y=9, we need to go through y=6,7,8,9 or possibly stay or down, but up is faster.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at turn 12, y=1 is unsafe, but we are on y=5, safe.\n\nAt turn 14, y=2 is unsafe.\n\nAt turn 17,18 y=1 unsafe.\n\nAt turn 19,20 all y=3 to8 unsafe.\n\nSince we want to reach quickly, let's aim for turn 16 at y=9.\n\nWith actions from turn 12 to 15.\n\ny12=5\n\nWe need to set y13, y14, y15, y16 with actions a12 to a15.\n\ny16=9.\n\nAnd for each turn t=12 to 16, position (0,y_t) must be safe.\n\nt=16, y16=9, safe.\n\nt=12, y12=5, safe as above.\n\nNow, we need y13, y14, y15.\n\ny_t must be between 0 and 9.\n\nThe net change: from y12=5 to y16=9, need +4 in 4 steps (y13 to y16).\n\ny13 = y12 + dy12\n\ny14 = y13 + dy13\n\ny15 = y14 + dy14\n\ny16 = y15 + dy15\n\nWe want y16=9.\n\nSince each dy <=1, to increase by 4, we need at least 4 U actions, but we have 4 actions, so possible with all U, or with some S, but S would require more U or not reach +4.\n\nWith 4 actions, we can have different combinations.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible.\n\nSo ideally, all U: y13=6, y14=7, y15=8, y16=9.\n\nNow check safety at each turn.\n\nTurn 12: y=5, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=6, need to check if y=6 safe at T=13.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, which is unsafe only at T=19,20, so at T=13, safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at 19,20, so T=14 safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at 19,20, T=15 safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=9, safe.\n\nSo all safe? But we have to consider if at turn 14, y=7 is safe, yes.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=2 is unsafe, but we are on y=7, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe times are later.\n\nSo with this path, all positions are safe at all turns.\n\nIs that possible? But let's confirm the car states.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, freeway 2 is unsafe, but we are on freeway 7, which is safe at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17,18, freeway 1 unsafe, but we are at y=9 by then if we reach early.\n\nIn this path, at turn 16 we are at y=9.\n\nTurn 17 and 18, if we are still there, but we don't care after reaching.\n\nWe just need to reach at turn 16.\n\nIn this sequence, with a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U.\n\nThen y13=6, y14=7, y15=8, y16=9.\n\nTurns: 12: y=5 safe\n\n13: y=6 safe\n\n14: y=7 safe\n\n15: y=8 safe\n\n16: y=9 safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a problem? Freeway 8 at turn 15 is safe, since unsafe only at 19,20.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let's check if y=8 at turn 15 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: same as y=3, etc., with car that is unsafe at T=19,20 only.\n\nAt T=15, for the second car: c_low= -53 +6(15-12)= -53 +6*3= -53+18= -35\n\nc_high= -42 +18= -24, all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nWe can reach in 4 actions? But earlier I thought H=5 for the sequence.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nWith actions a12, a13, a14, a15 (4 actions), we set y16=9.\n\nPosition at turn 16 is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions: for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nHere t1=12, actions a12 to a15, that's t=0,1,2,3? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIf H=4, actions a12, a13, a14, a15.\n\nThen position at turn t1 + H -1 =12 +4 -1=15 is y15, which is 8, not 9.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9), which is not the case.\n\nTo have position at turn K=12+H-1 be (0,9), we need y_{12+H-1}=9.\n\nFor example, if H=5, actions a12 to a16, position at turn 12+5-1=16 is y16.\n\nWe can set y16=9 with a15=U when y15=8.\n\nBut y15=8 needs to be set earlier.\n\nWith H=5, we have an extra action.\n\nBut we can reach at turn 16 with y16=9 using 4 actions, but the position at turn 15 is y15=8, not 9.\n\nThe task requires to reach at turn t1 + H -1, with the sequence of H actions.\n\nFor H=4, position at turn 15 is (0,8), not (0,9).\n\nFor H=5, position at turn 16 is (0,9) if we set it.\n\nBut with 5 actions, we can have y16=9.\n\nFor example: a12=U: y13=6\n\na13=U: y14=7\n\na14=U: y15=8\n\na15=U: y16=9\n\nThen a16 can be anything, say S, but not needed, but in the sequence, we have to include it.\n\nActions: a12 to a16, but a16 determines y17, which is after.\n\nPosition at turn 16 is y16=9.\n\nIn the sequence, a16 is included, but it doesn't affect the position at 16.\n\nFor the path, we need turns 12 to 16 safe.\n\nAt turn 16, y=9 safe.\n\nBut with the actions above, y15=8 at turn 15, which is safe as before.\n\ny16=9.\n\nIf we do a16=S, y17=9, but not necessary.\n\nBut the minimal H: with 4 actions, we can be at (0,9) at turn 16, but the position at turn t1+H-1=15 is (0,8), not (0,9).\n\nTo have position at turn T=16 with y=9, we need H such that 12 + H -1 =16, so H=5.\n\nThen with 5 actions, we can reach at turn 16.\n\nWith 4 actions, we can be at y=9 at turn 16, but the defined position for H=4 is at turn 15.\n\nSo we must use H=5 to have position at turn 16.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But at turn 15, y15 cannot be 9, as y15<=8.\n\nAt turn 14, y14<=7, etc.\n\nSo earliest possible to have y_T=9 is T=16, with y16=9.\n\nThus for position at turn 16, we need H=5.\n\nActions: a12 to a16.\n\nWe can set a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, then y13=6, y14=7, y15=8, y16=9.\n\nThen a16 can be S or U or D, but if we do U, y17=10, but y must be in 0-9, so not allowed. y must be in [0,9], so y17=10 invalid, so a16 must be S or D.\n\nIf a16=S, y17=9; if D, y17=8.\n\nBut since we reached at turn 16, y16=9, we can do a16=S to stay, or whatever, but the position is already reached.\n\nFor the sequence, we need to specify a16.\n\nIn terms of safety, at turn 16, y=9 safe.\n\nIf we do a16=S, y17=9, but turn 17 not considered.\n\nNow, with this, all turns safe as before.\n\nBut is there a reason to do differently? For example, if we want to avoid some time, but here it seems fine.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=2 is unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster with H smaller, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 12, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nIf we could be at y=9 earlier, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps with down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nIn this case, actions: a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=S (for example)\n\nThen position: turn 12: y=5\n\na12=U: turn 13: y=6\n\na13=U: turn 14: y=7\n\na14=U: turn 15: y=8\n\na15=U: turn 16: y=9\n\na16=S: turn 17: y=9, but not needed.\n\nAt turn 16, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd all safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 12, we have action a12, but position at turn 12 is before action.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions for each turn.\n\nNow, but we have to make sure that during the path, no collision.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, when we are at y=7, freeway 7 is safe, as computed.\n\nBut freeway 2 is unsafe at T=14, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the safety for each freeway over time.\n\nFreeway safety:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=12,17,18\n\ny=2: unsafe T=14\n\ny=3: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=4: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=5: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=6: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=7: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=8: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nIn the path above, we are on y=5 at T=12 (safe), y=6 at T=13 (safe), y=7 at T=14 (safe, since unsafe only 19,20), y=8 at T=15 (safe), y=9 at T=16 (safe).\n\nT=14 y=7 is safe, yes.\n\nBut at T=14, y=2 is unsafe, but irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, later unsafe times are after we reached.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 7 at T=14 that could be unsafe? No, as per calculation.\n\nTo be thorough, for freeway 7 at T=14:\n\nCars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFirst car: c_low=13 +6(14-12)=13+12=25>0, c_high=24+12=36>0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: c_low= -53 +6(2)= -53+12= -41, c_high= -42+12= -30, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,5) at turn 12, and we move up each turn.\n\nIn the actions, for turn 12, we do U, to go to y=6 at turn 13.\n\nBut at turn 12, we are at y=5, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps we can do nothing, but that would delay.\n\nSince H=5 is minimal for reaching at turn 16.\n\nCan we reach at turn 16 with fewer actions? No, because it takes at least 4 steps to increase by 4.\n\nWith H=4 actions, position at turn 15 is at most y=8.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence: a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=S (or D, but S to stay).\n\nBut a16=S to stay at y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to list for each turn.\n\nBut turn t1=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut for turn 16, action a16, which we set to S.\n\nPosition at turn 16 is y=9, reached.\n\nIn the sequence, it includes a16.\n\nPerhaps we can omit a16 if we don't need to act, but the sequence must have H actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSince we reached at turn 16, and H=5, we have to include turn 16 action.\n\nWe can choose a16=S.\n\nNow, but let's see if there is any issue at turn 17 or 18, but since we are at y=9, safe, and we don't care.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 1 at T=17,18 unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower to avoid something, but not necessary.\n\nSuppose we want to reach at turn 16, but with different actions.\n\nFor example, if at some point we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nAt turn 14, y=2 is unsafe, but we are not on y=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go through other paths, but going directly up is fine.\n\nBut what about freeway 8 at turn 15, safe.\n\nBut let's list the actions clearly.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt1=12.\n\nActions for t=12 to 12+H-1=16.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we reach later, but H larger, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn 17, H might be larger.\n\nT=17, y17=9, then position at turn 17, with H such that 12+H-1=17, H=6, more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence above, with a16=S, it works.\n\nIf we do a16=D, y17=8, but position at turn 16 is still 9.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, at T=12, it is unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if the player is on a freeway when a car is passing, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAnother point: the note about moving to different freeway.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=5 to y=6 at turn 12 action, at turn 12 we are on y=5, then after action, at turn 13 on y=6.\n\nAt turn 12, we are on y=5, which is safe.\n\nNo car on y=5 at T=12 has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) at turn 16 (since \\(t_1 = 12\\) and \\(H = 5\\), so \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12 + 5 - 1 = 16\\)) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- **Initial position at turn 12**: (0, 5), which is safe since freeway 5 is unsafe only at turns 19 and 20.\n- **Target position at turn 16**: (0, 9), which is always safe as there are no cars on freeway 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions must ensure that the player's position at each turn from 12 to 16 is safe, considering the car positions at those turns. The car positions and safety for each freeway at relevant turns are computed as follows:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe at turns 12, 17, and 18.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe at turn 14.\n- **Freeways 3 to 8 (y=3 to y=8)**: Unsafe at turns 19 and 20 (safe at turns 12 to 18).\n\nThe optimal path is to move directly upward from y=5 to y=9 in four steps (U actions), arriving at y=9 at turn 16. The fifth action (at turn 16) is S to stay at y=9, as moving up would exceed y=9 and moving down would leave y=9.\n\n- **Turn 12**: Start at (0, 5). Action U moves to y=6 at turn 13. Freeway 5 is safe at turn 12.\n- **Turn 13**: Position (0, 6). Action U moves to y=7 at turn 14. Freeway 6 is safe at turn 13.\n- **Turn 14**: Position (0, 7). Action U moves to y=8 at turn 15. Freeway 7 is safe at turn 14 (unsafe only at turns 19 and 20).\n- **Turn 15**: Position (0, 8). Action U moves to y=9 at turn 16. Freeway 8 is safe at turn 15 (unsafe only at turns 19 and 20).\n- **Turn 16**: Position (0, 9). Action S to stay at y=9. Freeway 9 is always safe.\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 5\\) actions and reaches (0, 9) at turn 16. Fewer actions are impossible because it takes at least 4 steps to increase y from 5 to 9, and with \\(H = 4\\), the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15\\) would be at most y=8, not y=9.\n\nThe sequence ensures all positions are safe:\n- Turn 12: y=5 safe (unsafe only at 19-20)\n- Turn 13: y=6 safe (unsafe only at 19-20)\n- Turn 14: y=7 safe (unsafe only at 19-20)\n- Turn 15: y=8 safe (unsafe only at 19-20)\n- Turn 16: y=9 safe\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) at turn t1=13 to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision rule is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is in the car's span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new freeway, you're not on it until the next turn, so at turn T, you're on y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. So at turn T, you're only concerned with cars on y_T for that turn.\n\nNow, looking at the car states. All cars are moving right, according to the table. Direction is given as \"right\" for all, so they're all right-moving, meaning their spans increase over time.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], since head and tail are given at t1.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], and since it's moving right, h should be greater than τ, I assume. Let me check the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (12,1,right,6), so head=12, tail=1, so at t1=13, span is [1,12] I think? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right-moving, head is the front, so at t1, span is [tail, head] = [1,12] for this car.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving it would be decreasing, but all are right here.\n\nAlso, collision when 0 is in span(T) for the freeway the player is on at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at t1=13.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn, the minimum H would be at least 3, because from 6 to 9 is 3 steps up. But we have to avoid collisions, so it might take more if there are obstacles.\n\nNow, let's see the car positions and how they evolve.\n\nFirst, t1=13 is the current turn. At this turn, the player is on y=6, so we need to check if there's a collision at t=13 for y=6.\n\nBut the action is chosen at each turn, starting from t1.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which sets Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, for collision at turn t: it depends on y_t, the row we're on during turn t.\n\nAnd for that row, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might be collided if for y_T, 0 in span of some car at T.\n\nThen after action, you move to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we start at t1=13, y=6.\n\nWe need to output actions for t=13,14,... up to some H where y_{t1+H-1} =9? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, a_{t1}, t=1, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAnd after H actions, at time t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nLet's see: after action a_t at turn t, we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after sequence from t=13 to t=13+H-1, actions a13 to a_{13+H-1}, then at time t=13+H, y_{13+H} =9.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), which is the position after the last action.\n\nIn the position, it's after the action.\n\nDefine: at time t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nChoose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision checked at time t based on y_t.\n\nFor the player to be at (0,9), it means that at some time T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, from t=13 to t=13+H-1, we have H actions, so we go from time 13 to time 13+H.\n\nAt time 13, y13 =6 (given).\n\nAfter a13, y14 = y13 + Δy13\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{13+H-1}, y_{13+H} = y_{13+H-1} + Δy_{13+H-1}\n\nWe want y_{13+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nNow, collision must be avoided at each turn t from 13 to 13+H-1, because at those turns, we are on some y_t, and if for that y_t, 0 in car span at t, collision.\n\nAt turn t=13+H, we are at y=9, but since we are done, no action, so no need to check collision? The collision is only when we are on the freeway during a turn, I think for the turn we are acting.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at (0, y_T), and we are on freeway y_T for that turn.\n\nSo for each turn from t=13 to t=13+H-1, we need to avoid collision at that turn, since we are acting.\n\nAt t=13+H, we have reached y=9, but we don't perform an action, so no turn to avoid collision? The turn is when we decide action.\n\nI think we need to consider turns from t=13 to t=13+H-1, and at t=13+H, we are done, so no collision check needed, as we're not moving or anything.\n\nThe game is multi-turn, and we stop when we reach (0,9), so at the turn when we first reach y=9, we might need to check collision if we are on that freeway.\n\nLet's see the problem: \"reach (0,9)\", and collision at turn T if on y_T and 0 in span.\n\nWhen we reach (0,9) at time T, we are on y_T=9 at that turn, so we need to ensure no collision at that turn as well.\n\nFor example, if at time T, y_T=9, and there is a car on freeway 9 with 0 in span at T, collision, even if we just arrived.\n\nSo we need to avoid collision at all turns from t=13 to t=T, where T is when y_T=9.\n\nIn terms of actions, from t=13 to t=T-1, we choose actions, and at time T, we are at y_T=9, and collision must be avoided at t=13 to t=T.\n\nT = t1 + H, since from t1=13, after H actions, at time 13+H.\n\nSet t_start =13.\n\ny_{t_start} =6\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_start + H, y_{t_start + H} =9\n\nCollision must be avoided for each turn t from t_start to t_start + H - 1? No.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nFor t from t_start to t_start + H - 1, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t_start + H, we are at y_{t_start + H} =9, and we need to be there without collision at that turn.\n\nSo turns to avoid collision: from t = t_start to t = t_start + H, inclusive.\n\nt_start to t_start + H.\n\nFor example, at t=13, we are at y=6, need no collision.\n\nAfter actions, at t=13+H, we are at y=9, need no collision.\n\nAnd for all t in between.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t=13 to t=13+H-1, H actions, leading to time t=13+H.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, all freeways have cars, but let's list them clearly.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nAt t1=13:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t is [τ + s(t-13), h + s(t-13)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: all have two cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (30,19,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 4,5,6,7,8 all the same.\n\nFreeway 1 is different.\n\nFreeway 2 is different.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at t=13.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: if no cars, we can go U,U,U in three turns, from t=13,14,15, to reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut need to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, at current turn t=13, player on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSpan for first car: at time t, [19 + 6(t-13), 30 + 6(t-13)] since right-moving, τ=19, h=30? In (head,tail), for right, head is larger, so τ=tail, h=head.\n\nIn the state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] since it's moving right, so head h is the right end, tail τ is left end? Let's see.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo at t1, span is [τ, h], so for example, freeway 6 car1: head=30, tail=19, so span at t1=13 is [19,30]\n\nSimilarly, car2: head=-36? tail=-47, direction right, so span at t1=13 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nNow, at time t, span is [τ + s(t-13), h + s(t-13)] for each.\n\nFor freeway 6 at time t:\n\nCar1: [19 + 6(t-13), 30 + 6(t-13)]\n\nCar2: [-47 + 6(t-13), -36 + 6(t-13)]\n\nCollision at turn t if player on freeway 6 and 0 in either span.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nPlayer at t=13 on y=6.\n\nCheck if 0 in span for y=6 at t=13.\n\nt=13: car1 span: [19+6(0), 30+6(0)] = [19,30], 0 not in [19,30]\n\ncar2 span: [-47, -36], 0 not in [-47,-36] since both negative.\n\nSo no collision at t=13 for y=6.\n\nNow, we want to move up to y=9 in min turns.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to go up, D or S would delay, so probably best to go U when possible, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time, if 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nBut time starts from t=13.\n\nAlso, freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars, and y=0 and y=9 are boundaries, no cars, I assume.\n\nThe problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\" and \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so when player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, since no cars there.\n\nIs that right?\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the vertical axis bounds, and freeways are between, so yes, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no collision, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,6), which is on freeway 6, but as we saw, no collision at t=13.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so when at y=9, no cars, so no collision issue.\n\nBut to be at y=9, we need to arrive there, and since no cars, it's fine.\n\nNow, the path: we need to go from y=6 to y=9, passing through y=7 and y=8 or directly if we jump, but we move one step at a time.\n\ny positions: 6,7,8,9.\n\nWe need to be on each row at some turn, but not necessarily, we can stay or move, but since we need to increase, we will pass through 7 and 8.\n\nBut we can stay on a row for multiple turns, but that increases H, so to minimize H, we should move up as much as possible, only delay if collision.\n\nMinimum H=3, actions U,U,U at t=13,14,15, to be at y=9 at t=16.\n\nNow, check for collisions during the path.\n\nAt t=13: on y=6, as above, no collision.\n\nAction a13: let's say U, so y14=7.\n\nAt t=14, on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: same as 6, since freeway 7 also has (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for all y=3 to 8, same cars.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 all have identical cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nAt time t, for any of these freeways, the spans are the same.\n\nCar1: [19 + 6(t-13), 30 + 6(t-13)]\n\nCar2: [-47 + 6(t-13), -36 + 6(t-13)]\n\nAt t=14, t-13=1\n\nSo car1 span: [19+6(1), 30+6(1)] = [25,36]\n\n0 not in [25,36]\n\ncar2 span: [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision at t=14 on y=7.\n\nAction a14: U, to y15=8.\n\nAt t=15, on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same cars.\n\nt=15, t-13=2\n\ncar1: [19+12, 30+12] = [31,42]\n\n0 not in.\n\ncar2: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nNo collision.\n\nThen action a15: U, to y16=9.\n\nAt t=16, on y=9, which has no cars, so no collision.\n\nSo with H=3, actions U,U,U at t=13,14,15, we reach y=9 at t=16 with no collisions.\n\nBut is that all? What about freeway 1 and 2? We didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nIn this path, we only were on y=6,7,8 at t=13,14,15, and all were safe.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 1 and 2, just to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 1: at t1=13, cars: (12,1,right,6), so span [1,12] at t=13\n\n(-24,-35,right,6) span [-35,-24] at t=13\n\n(54,43,right,6) span [43,54] at t=13\n\nAt t=13, 0 not in any.\n\nFreeway 2: (-12,-47,right,36) span [-47,-12] at t=13, 0 not in.\n\nBut we weren't on these, so fine.\n\nIn the path above, we only used y=6,7,8, all safe at the times.\n\nBut y=6 at t=13,14,15? No, at t=13 on y=6, t=14 on y=7, t=15 on y=8, each only once.\n\nAnd for each, no collision.\n\nSo minimal H should be 3.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if there is any issue.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 all have the same car configurations, so same at each time.\n\nBut in the sequence, we go directly up.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if at some time on a row it is occupied, but here it's not.\n\nMaybe for y=9, but no cars.\n\nBut the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but at x=0.\n\nIn the collision, it's when 0 is in the span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nIn this case, for the cars on y=6,7,8, at the times we are there, 0 is not covered.\n\nFor example, car1 on y=6: at t=13, [19,30], min 19>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, car2 has negative values, so left of 0.\n\nAt later times, it moves right, but since we move up quickly, we avoid.\n\nIn this case, with U,U,U, it works.\n\nBut let me check for t=14 on y=7: car1 [25,36]>0, car2 [-41,-30]<0, no 0.\n\nt=15 y=8: [31,42] and [-35,-24], no 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? For example, if on some row at some time it is occupied, but here not.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1 or 2, but we don't go there.\n\nAnother thing: the player starts at y=6, and we move to y=7 at t=14, etc.\n\nBut in the car update, for the row we are on.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it should be the sequence of actions.\n\nSo for H=3, actions at t=13: U, t=14: U, t=15: U.\n\nBut t from t=0 to H-1, but in the sequence, it's for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nSo for t1=13, actions at turn 13,14,15.\n\nBut after three actions, at time 16, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have three actions.\n\nBut is H=3 possible? It seems so.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 2 or something.\n\nFreeway 2 has a car with speed 36, which is high.\n\nBut at t=13, on y=2, but we are not there.\n\nAt time t, if we were on y=2, but we are not.\n\nFor example, at t=13, freeway 2 car: (-12,-47,right,36), span at t=13: [-47,-12] since τ=-47, h=-12.\n\n[τ + s(t-13), h + s(t-13)]\n\nAt t=13: [-47, -12]\n\n0 not in.\n\nAt t=14: [-47 +36(1), -12 +36(1)] = [-11, 24]? s=36, t-13=1, so [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11, 24]\n\nNow, 0 is in [-11,24]? -11 to 24, yes, 0 is between -11 and 24.\n\nBut we are not on y=2 at t=14, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, but since we are not on that row, no collision.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo for the path y=6,7,8 at t=13,14,15, all safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3, with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the problem has freeway 1 with multiple cars, but again, not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at t=13 on y=6, is there collision? As before, no.\n\nMaybe the car on freeway 1 at t=13: one car (12,1,right,6) span [1,12], which includes x=0? [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, others negative or large.\n\nSo 0 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the answer should be:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the sequence is for t=13 to t=13+H-1, with H=3, so t=13,14,15.\n\nThen at t=16, y=9.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let me see if H=2 is possible? From y=6 to y=9 in two actions? But each action changes y by at most 1, so from 6 to 9, minimum 3 actions, since 3 steps. y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, Δy in {-1,0,1}, so to increase by 3, need at least 3 actions if all U, or more if S or D.\n\nSo H min is 3, achievable.\n\nPerhaps with down or stay, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimal is 3 with U,U,U.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 has a car at (54,43,right,6), which at t=13 is [43,54], far right, no issue.\n\nAnd the other on left.\n\nBut all fine.\n\nPerhaps I misread the direction or something.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving: when you move to a new freeway, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you choose to move to y_{T+1}, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for example, at turn T, collision only on y_T.\n\nIn this case, when we are on y=7 at t=14, we are only concerned with cars on y=7 at that time, not y=6 or y=8.\n\nAnd we checked it's safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem has freeway 2 with high speed car, and at t=14, on y=2, 0 is occupied, but since we are not on y=2, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nFor example, at t=13, freeway 2: [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt=14: [-11,24], 0 in, so if on y=2 at t=14, collision, but we are not.\n\nt=15: [-47+36(2), -12+36(2)] = [-47+72, -12+72] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\n Etc.\n\nSo only at t=14 on y=2, it is occupied, but we avoid by not being there.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at t=14, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, with actions U at each turn.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 6\\) is 3, as each action can change the \\(y\\)-position by at most 1, requiring at least three \"up\" actions to increase by 3 units.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is:\n- At turn 13: move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14: move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15: move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n\nCollision analysis for each turn:\n- **Turn 13 (y = 6)**: Cars on freeway 6 are (30, 19, right, 6) and (-36, -47, right, 6). Spans at \\(t = 13\\):\n  - Car 1: \\([19 + 6(0), 30 + 6(0)] = [19, 30]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: \\([-47 + 6(0), -36 + 6(0)] = [-47, -36]\\), 0 not in span. No collision.\n- **Turn 14 (y = 7)**: Cars on freeway 7 are identical to freeway 6. Spans at \\(t = 14\\) (since \\(t - 13 = 1\\)):\n  - Car 1: \\([19 + 6(1), 30 + 6(1)] = [25, 36]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: \\([-47 + 6(1), -36 + 6(1)] = [-41, -30]\\), 0 not in span. No collision.\n- **Turn 15 (y = 8)**: Cars on freeway 8 are identical. Spans at \\(t = 15\\) (since \\(t - 13 = 2\\)):\n  - Car 1: \\([19 + 6(2), 30 + 6(2)] = [31, 42]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: \\([-47 + 6(2), -36 + 6(2)] = [-35, -24]\\), 0 not in span. No collision.\n\nAt turn 16, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), where there are no cars, so no collision check is needed.\n\nCars on other freeways (e.g., freeway 2 at \\(t = 14\\) has a span containing 0) do not affect the player since the player is not on those freeways at the relevant times.\n\nThus, \\(H = 3\\) is achievable with the sequence U, U, U, and it is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 13: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\ U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) at turn 14 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. The cars move horizontally on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at a turn when a car spans the x=0 position.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to x=0. Since collisions depend on whether the car spans x=0 at the exact turn when I'm on that row.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t=14, and they move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, for right-moving, it moves right. But in the car state, all cars listed seem to be right-moving, based on the direction. Let me check.\n\nFor freeway 1: (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6) — all right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for others, all are right-moving with speed 6, except freeway 2 has one car with speed 36? That seems fast.\n\nFreeway 2: (24,-11,right,36) — head 24, tail -11, direction right, speed 36.\n\nAnd freeways 3 to 8 all have two cars each: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6), all with speed 6.\n\nBut freeway 1 has three cars, freeway 2 has one, and 3-8 have two each. But since we're only concerned with when they cover x=0, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns the car spans include x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and I need to go from y=7 to y=9, which is only two steps up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\ny=7 to y=9, so minimum two turns: U and then U again, but I have to be on row 8 and 9 at some point, and check if there are cars at x=0 when I'm there.\n\nBut when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action a_T which determines y_{T+1}, but the collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nLet me read the collision rule carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if they cover x=0 at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, and I am present on that row only at that turn. When I take action a_T, it affects y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, I am at y=7. If I take action U, then at turn 15, I am at y=8. But at turn 14, I am on y=7, so I need to check cars on y=7 at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 15, if I am on y=8, check cars on y=8 at turn 15, and so on.\n\nThe key point is that when I move, the row I move to is occupied at the next turn, not at the current turn.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9, so I need to be at y=9 at some turn T, and I can stop or whatever, but since I just need to reach it, I can assume that once I'm at y=9, I can stay or do nothing, but the position is reached when I am there at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, meaning after H-1 actions, I am at position 9.\n\nt1 = 14, so at turn 14 + t for t from 0 to H-1, but let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1 + H - 1, and after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, but the position y_{t1 + H} should be 9? I think I'm confusing indices.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nLet t be the turn index. At turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence starts at t = t1 = 14, with y_{14} = 7.\n\nI need to find actions a_{14}, a_{15}, ..., up to some a_{14 + H - 1} such that after these H actions, y_{14 + H} = 9.\n\ny_{t} after action a_t is y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after H actions, the position is y_{14 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{14 + H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that I can achieve this without colliding at any turn from 14 to 14 + H - 1, because at each turn T from 14 to 14 + H - 1, I am at y_T, and I need no collision at that turn.\n\nAt turn 14 + H, I am at y_{14 + H} = 9, and since I don't need to do anything after, no collision check is needed for turn 14 + H, I think, because the goal is to reach at turn 14 + H, so as long as I arrive safely, it should be fine. But at the turn when I am at y=9, I need to not collide, meaning at turn 14 + H, when I am on y=9, there should be no car on freeway 9 at x=0, but freeway y=9? The freeways are from 1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think.\n\nLet's see the vertical axis: y=0,1,2,...,9. Freeways are at y=1 to 8, where cars are. y=0 and y=9 are the boundaries, no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nTherefore, when I am at y=0 or y=9, there is no car to collide with, so it's always safe.\n\nSimilarly, for the rows in between, I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car spans x=0.\n\nIn this case, to reach (0,9), since y=9 has no cars, once I am there, I am safe. I just need to get there.\n\nNow, from y=7, I need to go to y=8 and then y=9, or possibly go down to avoid cars and come back, but that would take more turns, so probably minimal H is 2 if I can go directly up.\n\nBut I need to check if at y=7 and y=8, when I am there, it is safe.\n\nFirst, at turn 14, I am at y=7. Is there a car on freeway 7 at turn 14 that spans x=0?\n\nFreeway 7 is row 7.\n\nFrom the car state, for freeway 7: cars are (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nSince both are right-moving, and at turn 14.\n\nFirst car: head h=36, tail τ=25, direction right, speed s=6.\n\nFor right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s(T - 14), h + s(T - 14)]\n\nSimilarly for the other car.\n\nt1=14, so at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-14), h + s(T-14)]\n\nFor freeway 7, car 1: τ=25, h=36, s=6\n\nAt turn T, span: [25 + 6(T-14), 36 + 6(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, car 2: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6, since (-30,-41,right,6), so tail is -41, head is -30? Head and tail, but for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and moves to [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the state, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], I think, because it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\" in the update.\n\nLet's read: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h], with τ being the left end (tail), h being the right end (head), I assume.\n\nIn the notation, for freeway 1, (18,7,right,6), so head=18, tail=7? But 18>7, so if right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, ( -18, -29, right,6), head=-18, tail=-29, since -18 > -29, so τ=-29, h=-18.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7, (36,25,right,6), so τ=25, h=36? No, the state says (head h, tail τ), so for (36,25,right,6), head=36, tail=25, so since right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nSimilarly, (-30,-41,right,6), head=-30, tail=-41, so [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nNow for freeway 7 at turn T, car 1: span [25 + 6(T-14), 36 + 6(T-14)]\n\nCar 2: span [-41 + 6(T-14), -30 + 6(T-14)]\n\nNow, x=0 is in the span if for some car, min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 ∈ [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor car 1: low = 25 + 6(T-14), high = 36 + 6(T-14)\n\nSince s=6>0, and T-14 >=0, low and high increase with T.\n\nAt T=14, low=25, high=36, both >0, so 0 not in [25,36].\n\nSimilarly, car 2 at T=14: low=-41, high=-30, both <0, so 0 not in [-41,-30].\n\nSo at T=14, for freeway 7, no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other T, but I only care when I am on that row.\n\nBut for now, at turn 14, I am on y=7, and it's safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=8 or something.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway 8.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each turn when it is occupied, meaning when some car spans x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car such that 0 ∈ [τ + s(T-14), h + s(T-14)] for that car.\n\nSince all cars on a freeway have the same speed? Not necessarily, but in this case, for each freeway, the cars have same speed.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars all speed 6.\n\nFreeway 2 has one car speed 36.\n\nFreeways 3-8 have two cars each, all speed 6.\n\nFreeway 2 has only one car.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 has three cars.\n\nBut for collision, I only care if at least one car covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nSo for each row and each turn, I can compute if it is occupied (dangerous) or not.\n\nSince I need to go to y=8 and y=9, but y=9 is safe.\n\nI start at y=7 at t=14.\n\nIf I take action U at t=14, I go to y=8 at t=15.\n\nThen at t=15, I am on y=8, and if safe, I can take U again to go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nIf not safe, I might need to wait or go down.\n\nSimilarly, I could go down first, but that might take more turns.\n\nSo let's check the situation at y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: similar to 7, cars (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAt turn T, car 1: span [25 + 6(T-14), 36 + 6(T-14)]\n\nCar 2: span [-41 + 6(T-14), -30 + 6(T-14)]\n\nNow, when is 0 in one of these?\n\nFor car 1: 0 ∈ [25 + 6Δ, 36 + 6Δ] where Δ = T-14\n\nSo 25 + 6Δ <= 0 <= 36 + 6Δ\n\nBut 25 + 6Δ <=0 implies 6Δ <= -25, Δ <= -25/6 ≈ -4.166, but Δ >=0 since T>=14, so impossible. 25 + 6Δ >=25>0 for Δ>=0, so low >=25>0, so 0 not in [low,high] for car 1.\n\nSimilarly, for car 2: 0 ∈ [-41 + 6Δ, -30 + 6Δ]\n\nSo -41 + 6Δ <= 0 <= -30 + 6Δ\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 6Δ <=0 => 6Δ <=41 => Δ <= 41/6 ≈6.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -30 + 6Δ => 6Δ >=30 => Δ >=5\n\nSo for Δ between 5 and 6.833, approximately.\n\nΔ integer, so Δ=5,6\n\nΔ=5: T=14+5=19\n\nΔ=6: T=20\n\nNow check:\n\nΔ=5: low = -41 + 6*5 = -41 +30 = -11\n\nHigh = -30 +30 =0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since high=0.\n\nSimilarly, Δ=6: low = -41 +36 = -5, high = -30 +36=6, so [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔ=7: low=-41+42=1, high=-30+42=12, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, Δ=4: low=-41+24= -17, high=-30+24= -6, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, occupied (dangerous) at turns T=19 and T=20.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7, we had car 2: 0 ∈ [-41 +6Δ, -30 +6Δ]\n\nSame as above, for Δ=5 and 6, T=19 and 20.\n\nBut at T=14, we saw not occupied.\n\nNow for car 1 on row 7: not occupied for any Δ, since low>0.\n\nSimilarly for row 8, car 1 not, car 2 at Δ=5,6.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have the same car types? Freeway 7 and 8 both have the same cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6), so same as above.\n\nFreeway 7: cars (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nIn the table, freeways 3 to 8 all have identical cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAnd freeway 1 has different, freeway 2 different.\n\nBut for row 7 (freeway 7) and row 8 (freeway 8), both have the same car configurations, so the dangerous times are the same: at T=19 and 20 for both.\n\nT=19 and 20.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nAt turn 14, I am at y=7, safe.\n\nI want to go to y=8.\n\nIf I take U at t=14, I go to y=8 at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, I am on y=8.\n\nIs y=8 safe at t=15?\n\nΔ = T-14 =15-14=1\n\nFor row 8, at Δ=1, car 1: [25+6(1),36+6(1)] = [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nCar 2: [-41+6(1), -30+6(1)] = [-35,-24], both <0, 0 not in. So safe at t=15.\n\nThen at t=15, I am on y=8, safe. If I take U, I go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, I am at y=9, which is safe since no cars.\n\nSo in two moves: U at t=14, U at t=15, I am at y=9 at t=16.\n\nH=2, turns: t=14 and t=15 actions.\n\nSequence: a_{14} = U, a_{15} = U, then at t=16, y=9.\n\nMinimal H should be 2.\n\nBut is there a problem? What about other rows? I only passed through y=8 at t=15, which is safe.\n\nAt t=14, y=7 safe; t=15, y=8 safe; t=16, y=9 safe.\n\nSeems fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 1 and 2, but I didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nFreeway 2 has high speed, but I don't care.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm for other freeways, but since I only need to be on y=7,8,9, and y=9 safe, y=7 and y=8 at the times I am there are safe.\n\ny=7 at t=14: Δ=0, as before, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=15: Δ=1, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 has different cars, but I'm not on row 1.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, etc.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see when other rows are dangerous.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nAt turn T, Δ=T-14\n\nCar 1: τ=7, h=18, s=6, span [7 + 6Δ, 18 + 6Δ] since right-moving, [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ]\n\nAt t1, [τ,h] = [7,18] for this car.\n\nSo at T, [7 + 6Δ, 18 + 6Δ]\n\n0 in it if 7+6Δ <=0 <=18+6Δ but 7+6Δ >=7>0 for Δ>=0, so never.\n\nCar 2: τ=-29, h=-18, s=6, span [-29 +6Δ, -18 +6Δ]\n\n0 in it if -29+6Δ <=0 <= -18+6Δ\n\nFirst: -29+6Δ <=0 => 6Δ <=29 => Δ <= 29/6 ≈4.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18+6Δ => 6Δ >=18 => Δ >=3\n\nSo Δ=3,4\n\nΔ=3: T=17, span [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔ=4: T=18, span [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nCar 3: τ=49, h=60, s=6, span [49+6Δ, 60+6Δ] all >0, never 0.\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous at T=17,18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car (24,-11,right,36)\n\nτ=-11, h=24, s=36\n\nSpan [-11 + 36Δ, 24 + 36Δ]\n\n0 in it if -11 +36Δ <=0 <=24 +36Δ\n\nFirst: -11+36Δ <=0 => 36Δ <=11 => Δ <= 11/36 ≈0.305\n\nSecond: 0 <=24 +36Δ always true for Δ>=0.\n\nBut Δ <=0.305, since Δ integer >=0, only Δ=0 possible? Δ=0: T=14, span [-11,24], which includes 0? -11 <=0 <=24, yes, 0 is in [-11,24].\n\nAt T=14, for freeway 2, occupied.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 2 at t=14, I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8, as before, dangerous at T=19,20 for each.\n\nNow back to the point: with two moves up, I can reach at t=16.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nt=14: position y=7, action a_14, which determines y_15.\n\nIf a_14 = U, then y_15 = 8.\n\nThen at t=15, position y=8, action a_15, if U, y_16=9.\n\nAt t=14, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nAt t=15, I am on y=8, with Δ=1 for t=15, T=15, Δ=1, y=8 safe as above.\n\nThen at t=16, y=9 safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot do this?\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if at t=15 on y=8 is safe, which it is.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to output actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nt1=14, so actions for turn 14,15,... up to when I reach.\n\nH is the number of actions, so with two actions, I reach at turn 16.\n\nBut the player position at turn t1 + H should be 9.\n\nt1 + H = 14 + H.\n\nAfter H actions, turn is 14 + H, position y_{14+H} =9.\n\nSo for H=2, turn 16, y=9.\n\nActions at turn 14 and 15.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 14: a_{14}\n\nTurn 15: a_{15}\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\na_{14} = U, a_{15} = U.\n\nBut is y=8 always safe except at t=19,20? At t=15 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I could go down, but no need.\n\nBut let me see if there is a car on row 7 at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=14, safe.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 for multiple turns, but at t=19,20, row 7 is dangerous, but I don't need to stay.\n\nIn this case, I move up immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should check if row 8 is safe at t=15, which it is.\n\nBut freeway 8 at Δ=1, safe.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 2 at t=14 is dangerous, but I am not there.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,7) at turn 14.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7, at t=14, cars are at [25,36] and [-41,-30], no 0.\n\nSimilarly for t=15.\n\nPerhaps I can list the safe times for row 8.\n\nRow 8 is freeway 8.\n\nAs above, dangerous only at T=19,20.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 dangerous at T=19,20.\n\nT=14 to 18 and after 20 should be safe for row 7 and 8, except the boundaries.\n\nFor example, row 7 at T=15: Δ=1, car1 [25+6=31,42], car2 [-41+6=-35,-24], both not cover 0.\n\nT=16: Δ=2, car1 [25+12=37,48], car2 [-41+12=-29,-18], no.\n\nT=17: Δ=3, car1 [43,54], car2 [-41+18=-23,-12], no.\n\nT=18: Δ=4, car1 [49,60], car2 [-41+24=-17,-6], no.\n\nT=19: Δ=5, car1 [55,66], car2 [-41+30=-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=20: Δ=6, car1 [61,72], car2 [-41+36=-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=21: Δ=7, car1 [67,78], car2 [-41+42=1,12], both >0, no 0.\n\nSimilarly for row 8 same.\n\nSo at t=15, which is Δ=1, safe.\n\nTherefore, going directly up should work with H=2.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in two turns.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action, and y must be in [0,9], so from y=7, U to 8, U to 9, both within range.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at t=14 I can go down, but that would take more turns to come back, so worse.\n\nOr stay, but staying doesn't help since I need to go up.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check freeway 1 and 2 to be complete.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous at T=17,18.\n\nFreeway 2 dangerous at T=14, as we saw, and also for other Δ?\n\nFreeway 2: car (24,-11,right,36)\n\nSpan: [-11 + 36Δ, 24 + 36Δ]\n\n0 in if -11 +36Δ <=0 <=24 +36Δ\n\n-11+36Δ <=0 => Δ <= 11/36 <1, so only for Δ=0, since Δ integer >=0.\n\nΔ=0: T=14, 0 in [-11,24]\n\nFor Δ=1: [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nΔ=2: [-11+72,24+72]= [61,96], etc.\n\nSo only dangerous at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, other times safe.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSo for my path, only need to be on y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nAt t=14, y=7 safe; t=15, y=8 safe.\n\nThus, actions: at turn 14: U, turn 15: U.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=9.\n\nH=2.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, but in terms of t1.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=2, t=0 and 1: a_{14 + 0} = a_{14}, a_{14+1}=a_{15}\n\nThen after, y_{16} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 15 on y=8 is indeed safe.\n\nTurn 15, freeway 8: cars as above, with Δ=1.\n\nCar1: [25 + 6(1), 36 + 6(1)] = [31,42], min=31>0, not cover 0.\n\nCar2: [-41 + 6(1), -30 + 6(1)] = [-35, -24], max=-24<0, not cover 0.\n\nSo no car covers x=0 at turn 15 on row 8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 14, row 7: car1 [25,36] >0, car2 [-41,-30]<0, no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2 with actions U at both turns.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and in this case it seems straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 1, there is a car (-18,-29,right,6), which at t=14 is [-29,-18], but we already considered.\n\nOr perhaps the direction, but all are right-moving.\n\nMaybe for left-moving, but in this case, no left-moving cars.\n\nAll cars are right-moving as per the state.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps at y=7, if I stay, but no need.\n\nSo I think H=2 is achievable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I were to go to y=8 at a later time, but at t=15 it is safe, so no need.\n\nPerhaps to avoid the danger at t=19,20, but since I pass at t=15, before that, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be two actions: U at turn 14 and U at turn 15.\n\nSo in the boxed format.\n\nBut let me write it as per the format.\n\n**Answer Format**:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nFor H=2, it would be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nIn the sequence, it should be until turn t1 + H -1, which is 15 for H=2.\n\nYes.\n\nIf H=2, actions at turn 14 and 15.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Times\n- **Freeway 7 (player row at turn 14)**:  \n  Cars: (36, 25, right, 6) and (-30, -41, right, 6).  \n  At turn \\(T\\), the spans are:  \n  - Car 1: \\([25 + 6(T-14), 36 + 6(T-14)]\\)  \n  - Car 2: \\([-41 + 6(T-14), -30 + 6(T-14)]\\)  \n  - At turn 14 (\\(T=14\\)): Spans [25, 36] and [-41, -30]; neither includes 0. Safe.  \n  - At turn 15 (\\(T=15\\)): Spans [31, 42] and [-35, -24]; neither includes 0. Safe.  \n  Freeway 7 is dangerous only at turns 19 and 20.\n\n- **Freeway 8 (player row if moving up)**:  \n  Cars: (36, 25, right, 6) and (-30, -41, right, 6) — same as freeway 7.  \n  - At turn 15 (\\(T=15\\)): Spans [31, 42] and [-35, -24]; neither includes 0. Safe.  \n  Freeway 8 is dangerous only at turns 19 and 20.\n\n- **Other freeways** (e.g., 1 and 2) are not relevant since the player only needs to be on rows 7, 8, and 9. Row 9 has no cars and is always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9)\n- At turn 14, player is at (0, 7). Action \\(a_{14} = U\\) moves to (0, 8) at turn 15.  \n  - Turn 14: On row 7, which is safe (no collision).  \n- At turn 15, player is at (0, 8). Action \\(a_{15} = U\\) moves to (0, 9) at turn 16.  \n  - Turn 15: On row 8, which is safe (no collision).  \n- At turn 16, player is at (0, 9), which is safe (no cars on row 9).\n\nThis path requires 2 actions (\\(H = 2\\)) and reaches (0, 9) at turn 16. Since row 9 is safe and no further actions are needed, the sequence is complete.\n\n### Minimal Turns\n- A direct upward path (U, U) takes 2 turns, which is minimal because moving down or staying would require at least one additional turn to reach row 9, resulting in \\(H > 2\\).  \n- The dangerous times for rows 7 and 8 (turns 19–20) are after the player has already reached row 9, so they do not affect this path.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 14 and 15 achieves the goal with \\(H = 2\\):\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U }",

Collision occurs if at that turn T, the player is at x=0 and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nAlso note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T during turn T (so we check the car on y_T at turn T) and then moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn (so at turn T+1, we check y_{T+1}).\n\nOur current state: turn 15, position (0,8). We are on freeway 8 at turn 15.\n\nWe need to check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 15? Actually, we are already at turn 15, and we are at (0,8). So we must check if at turn 15, there is a car on freeway 8 that has 0 in its span? If so, we are already collided? But the problem states that we are given the current state, so we assume we are safe at turn 15.\n\nThe task is to start from turn 15 (current) and plan the next actions.\n\nWe are at (0,8) at turn 15. We can take actions at turn 15, 16, ... until we reach (0,9).\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 1: because we are at 8 and need to go to 9. So we can try:\n\nOption 1: At turn 15, go up (U) -> then at turn 16, we would be at y=9. But we must check:\n  - At turn 15: we are at y=8. We must check freeway 8 at turn 15 for collision? But note: we are already at turn 15 and safe? The problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we are given the state, so we assume we are safe at turn 15.\n\nBut the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, then collision.\n\nSo at turn 15, we are at y=8. We must check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 15.\n\nLooking at the car state for freeway 8:\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (42, 31, right, 6) and (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nNote: the direction is right, so they are moving right? But the update rule for right-moving cars: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut wait: the table says \"head h, tail tau\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). So the initial span is [tau, h] meaning from tail to head? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at turn T, the car occupies the interval [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are at turn t1 = 15. So for freeway 8 at turn 15:\n\nFirst car: (h=42, tau=31, right, s=6) -> span at turn 15: [31 + 6*(15-15), 42 + 6*(15-15)] = [31, 42] -> 0 is not in [31,42].\n\nSecond car: (h=-24, tau=-35, right, s=6) -> note: the head is -24 and tail is -35? That doesn't make sense because -24 > -35. Actually, the table says: head h and tail tau. For a right-moving car, the head should be the larger coordinate? But here h=-24 and tau=-35, so head is at -24 and tail at -35? Then the car is from -35 to -24? \n\nWait, the update rule for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h]? But if tau=-35 and h=-24, then the span is [-35, -24]. Then at turn 15: [tau + s*(0), h + s*(0)] = [-35, -24]. 0 is not in [-35,-24].\n\nSo at turn 15, we are safe on freeway 8.\n\nNow, if we take action U at turn 15, then:\n  At turn 15: we are at y=8 -> safe.\n  Then we move to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut note: at turn 16, we will be at y=9. However, there are no cars on freeway 9 because the freeways are only from 1 to 8. So we are safe at turn 16? \n\nBut wait, the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if we do U at turn 15, then at turn 16 we are at (0,9). We don't have to worry about freeway 9 because there are no cars. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1? But wait, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. So we are at turn 15 (t=0 in the sequence index) and we take one action at turn 15. Then at the next turn (turn 16) we are at (0,9). So H=1.\n\nBut let me check the answer format: we are to write from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. So if H=1, then we only have one action at turn 15.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for H=1, we have one action: at t=0 (which is turn 15).\n\nSo the answer would be:\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut is that safe? We are at turn 15: we are at y=8 and we take U. Then at turn 16 we are at y=9. The collision condition is only checked when we are on a freeway (y=1..8). At turn 15 we are at y=8 and we have checked that there is no car at freeway 8 at turn 15 that covers 0. Then we move to y=9 at turn 16, and since there is no freeway 9 to check (or it's safe by absence of cars), we are done.\n\nBut wait: what about during the move? The problem states: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn 15, we are only on y=8. We are not on y=9 until turn 16. And at turn 16, we are at y=9 and there are no cars on freeway 9.\n\nTherefore, we can do it in one move.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states for freeway 8 at turn 15: we have two cars, both are away from 0. The closest is the second car at [-35,-24] which is negative, and 0 is not in that interval.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So we are safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the freeways are y=1,...,8. And we are going to y=9, which is not a freeway? So no cars on y=9. So we are safe.\n\nBut why are there so many freeways with the same car data? It seems freeways 3 to 8 have the same car data. But for freeway 8, we already checked.\n\nSo the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me consider: is there a reason we cannot move up immediately? For example, if there were a car at freeway 8 at turn 15 that covered 0, then we would have to wait. But we checked: no.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to go up and then be at turn 16 at y=9, but what if we have to avoid something? But y=9 is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be one action: U at turn 15.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is (0,8) and we are at turn 15. We are going to move to (0,9) at turn 16. And the problem asks for the sequence until we reach (0,9). So we reach at turn 16.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So if H=1, then we are at (0,9) at turn 15+1-1 = turn 15? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me clarify: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, meaning:\n\n- At turn t1 + 0: we take the first action (which is a_{t1})\n- ...\n- At turn t1 + (H-1): we take the last action.\n\nThen the player's position after the last action (at turn t1+H) would be the new position. But note: we start at turn t1 with position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8). Then we take an action at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we have the new position.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the time we have taken the last action? Actually, the position after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? No, it says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions. After H actions, we are at turn t1+H. So we require that at turn t1+H, the player is at (0,9).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\" in the condition? Let me read:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut in the player update: after taking an action at turn t, we get the next state at turn t+1.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn t1: we are at y_{t1} (which is 8).\n- We take action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+1} = 9, we need to take U at turn t1. Then at turn t1+1, we are at 9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1. In this case, we take one action (at t1) and then at turn t1+1 we are at 9. So H should be 1? Then the turn when we are at 9 is turn t1+1 = 16.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is until turn t1+H-1. For H=1, that would be turn t1+0 = turn 15. So we take action at turn 15. And then we are at 9 at turn 16.\n\nBut the requirement is that at the end of the sequence, we are at (0,9). So we are at (0,9) at turn 16, which is after the action.\n\nSo the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Or at turn t1+H?\n\nLooking back: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nThat is a critical point.\n\nThe problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nNow, when we take the first action at turn t1 (which is t1+0), then at turn t1+1 we are at a new position. So at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. But the requirement is at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nIf H=1, then we require at turn t1+1-1 = turn t1 (15) we are at 9? But we start at turn 15 at 8. So we are not at 9 at turn 15. Therefore, H=1 is not valid.\n\nWe must be at 9 at the last action turn? The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at the next state at turn t1+H. But the requirement is the state at turn t1+H-1 must be 9.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at the turn when we take the last action? That would mean we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? But if we are already at 9, then we don't need to move? Or we can take an action that doesn't move? But the goal is to be at 9, so if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we have reached.\n\nBut how do we get to 9? We start at turn 15 at 8. So we must have taken some actions to get to 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nExample: \n- If we take U at turn 15 (t1=15), then at turn 16 (which is t1+1) we are at 9. So at turn 16, we are at 9. But we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 15 + H - 1.\n\nSet 15 + H - 1 = 16 -> then H=2.\n\nSo with H=2, we require to be at 9 at turn 15+2-1 = 16. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2? But wait, that would require two actions. But we only need one action (U) to get to 9 at turn 16.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1. For H=2, we have two actions: at turn 15 and turn 16.\n\nBut we only need to take action at turn 15 (U) to get to 9 at turn 16. Then at turn 16, we are at 9. But if we have to take an action at turn 16? Then we might move away? Or we can take S (stay). \n\nSo the plan: \n  Turn 15: U -> then at turn 16, we are at 9.\n  Then at turn 16, we are already at 9, so we take S? But the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 15+2-1=16) we are at 9. And we are. So that works.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? Then we require to be at 9 at turn 15+1-1 = turn 15. But we start at 8 at turn 15, so we are not at 9 at turn 15. Therefore, H cannot be 1.\n\nSo minimal H is 2? But note: we could also do nothing at turn 15 and then move at turn 16? But that would take two actions as well and we would be at 9 at turn 17? That would be worse.\n\nBut with H=2, we do:\n  Turn 15: U -> moves to 9 at turn 16.\n  Turn 16: S (or any, but we are at 9, so we can stay) -> but then at turn 17 we would still be at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn 16 (t1+H-1 = 15+2-1=16) we are at 9. So we are. And we have taken two actions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We are using two turns (turn 15 and 16) to take actions, and we are at 9 at turn 16. But note that we reached 9 at turn 16, which is after one action (at turn 15). The second action at turn 16 is not necessary for reaching 9? But the problem requires that we are at 9 at the last action turn (turn 16). So we are already there at turn 16, so we can just stay.\n\nBut we can also consider: what if we do nothing at turn 15 and then at turn 16 we move up? Then at turn 16 we are at 9? But that would also be at turn 16. However, that also requires two actions: S at 15 and U at 16. Then we are at 9 at turn 17? No:\n\n- Turn 15: S -> y_16 = 8 (stays at 8? no: if we do S, then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} = 8 at turn 16.\n- Then at turn 16: U -> then at turn 17, y=9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn 17. Then for H=2, we require at turn 15+2-1=16 we are at 9? But we are at 8 at turn 16. So that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only way to be at 9 at turn 16 is to have taken an action at turn 15 that moves us up. Then we are at 9 at turn 16. Then we take an action at turn 16 (which is the second action) to stay? But we are already at 9 at turn 16, so we can take S.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions. Let's check:\n\nAt turn 15: we are at y=8. We take U. Then at turn 15, we are on freeway 8. We already checked: at turn 15, freeway 8 is safe (no car covers 0).\n\nThen we move to y=9 at turn 16. At turn 16, we are at y=9. But freeway 9 is not defined? The freeways are only from 1 to 8. So no collision at turn 16? \n\nBut wait, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway. At turn 16, we are at y=9. Since there is no freeway 9 (or it is not listed), we assume there are no cars? So safe.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n  Turn 15: U\n  Turn 16: S\n\nBut why do we need to take an action at turn 16? Because the sequence must be of length H=2, and we must be at 9 at turn 16. We are at 9 at turn 16, and then we take S to stay.\n\nBut note: after taking the action at turn 16, we are still at 9 at turn 17. But the problem only requires that we are at 9 at turn 16 (which is t1+H-1). So we don't care about turn 17.\n\nHowever, we must check collision at turn 16? We are at y=9 at turn 16. Since there is no car on freeway 9 (because the freeways are only 1 to 8), we are safe.\n\nBut what if we don't take an action at turn 16? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we must take two actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, and the sequence is:\n  Turn 15: U\n  Turn 16: S\n\nBut let me see if we can do without the second action? The problem says H is the number of turns (actions) we take. And we must be at 9 at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1). So if we take only one action (at turn 15), then the last action turn is turn 15, but at turn 15 we are at 8 (not 9). So we need two actions.\n\nAlternatively, we could take an action at turn 15 that doesn't move and then at turn 16 move? But then we are at 9 at turn 17, so we would need H=3? Because we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 15+H-1. Set 15+H-1=17 -> H=3. So that is worse.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check if there is any problem with the cars at turn 16? We are at y=9 at turn 16, so no car collision. The only freeway we were on during the moves was:\n  Turn 15: on freeway 8 (safe)\n  Turn 16: on freeway 9 (safe, no cars)\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about the cars on other freeways? We don't care because we are never on them. We are only on freeway 8 at turn 15 and freeway 9 at turn 16? But freeway 9 is not a freeway with cars? So it's safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says the freeways are y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are not freeways? Then at y=9, there are no cars? So safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut wait, at turn 16 we are at y=9 and we take S. Then we remain at 9. But we don't need to remain, but it's safe.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot take U at turn 16? Then we would go to y=10? But y is only up to 9. The update rule: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, we stay at 9? Or the problem says \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and then \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and take U, we try to go to 10, but then it is clamped to 9? The problem doesn't specify clamping. But it says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So we assume that if we try to go above 9, we stay at 9? So U at 9 is effectively the same as S.\n\nBut to be safe, we can take S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut we must write the answer in the box.\n\nBut wait, the initial state says the player is at (0,8) at turn 15. We are going to move to 9 at turn 16, and then at turn 16 we are at 9 and we take S. Then we are still at 9 at turn 17.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stop after reaching, but we just have to reach at the last action turn. So it's acceptable.\n\nHowever, let me check if we can do it without the second action? The problem requires that we are at 9 at the last action turn. If we take only one action (at turn 15) then the last action turn is turn 15, but at turn 15 we are at 8. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it with H=2 but a different sequence? For example, turn 15: S, turn 16: U? Then at turn 15: we are at 8 (safe). Then at turn 16: we are still at 8? Because we took S at 15. Then at turn 16, we take U: then we move to 9 at turn 17. But then we are at 9 at turn 17. We require to be at 9 at turn 15+2-1=16? But we are at 8 at turn 16. So that doesn't work.\n\nSo the only possibility is to move up at turn 15 and then at turn 16 we are at 9 and we take any action that doesn't move us down (so S or U, but U is same as S at 9). We choose S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=2.\n\nBut wait, what if we take U at turn 15 and then at turn 16 we take D? Then we go back to 8 at turn 17. Then we are not at 9 at turn 16? We are at 9 at turn 16? \n\nAfter taking U at turn 15: at turn 16 we are at 9. Then at turn 16 we take D: then at turn 17 we go to 8. But at turn 16 (the last action turn) we are at 9? Yes, because the state at the beginning of turn 16 is 9. Then we take an action at turn 16. The state at turn 16 is 9. So we are at 9 at turn 16. Then we take D, which is allowed, but we are at 9 at the required time. However, that would be a valid sequence? But then we leave 9. The problem doesn't require to stay, only to be at 9 at the last action turn (turn 16). So D at turn 16 is acceptable? But it's unnecessary and might cause issues? However, we are at turn 16 at y=9: we take D. Then we move to y=8 at turn 17. But at turn 16, we are on freeway 9? Which is safe. Then at turn 17 we are at y=8, but we don't care because the sequence is over.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then we leave? That doesn't matter. The condition is that at the last action turn (turn 16) we are at 9. So we are.\n\nHowever, the minimal sequence should be as efficient as possible? But we are only concerned with minimal H. And we are taking two actions. But taking D at turn 16 is not necessary, so we can take S to be safe.\n\nBut let me check collision for turn 16 if we take D: at turn 16, we are at y=9 (so safe). Then we move to y=8 at turn 17, but that is after the last action turn, so we don't care. So it's safe.\n\nBut to keep it simple, we can do S.\n\nSo either S or D or U at turn 16 is acceptable? But U at turn 16 (if we are at 9) would keep us at 9? So it's the same as S.\n\nBut D would move us down, which is not necessary. So we choose S.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains.\n\nBut let me double-check the cars at turn 15 on freeway 8: we have two cars. The update rule for the cars at turn T (relative to turn 15):\n\nFor a car on freeway 8 at turn T: \n  For the first car: (42,31,right,6): at turn T, span = [31 + 6*(T-15), 42 + 6*(T-15)]\n  Second car: (-24,-35,right,6): span = [-35 + 6*(T-15), -24 + 6*(T-15)]\n\nAt turn 15: \n  first: [31,42] -> 0 not in\n  second: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in\n\nAt turn 16: \n  first: [31+6=37, 42+6=48] -> still not 0.\n  second: [-35+6=-29, -24+6=-18] -> not 0.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 8 at turn 16? We are on freeway 9 at turn 16. So we don't check freeway 8 at turn 16.\n\nTherefore, safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n\nBut wait, the initial turn is 15, and we are taking two actions: at 15 and 16.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=2.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? We already saw that we cannot be at 9 at turn 15 (the last action turn for H=1 is turn 15) because we start at 8.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- At turn 15, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 (at turn 15) are:\n  - \\((42, 31, \\text{right}, 6)\\): span = \\([31, 42]\\) (0 not in span)\n  - \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 6)\\): span = \\([-35, -24]\\) (0 not in span)\n  Since 0 is not in any car's span, the position is safe.\n\nTo reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + H - 1\\), the minimal \\(H\\) is 2, as:\n- At turn 15 (start), \\(y = 8\\).\n- After one action (e.g., U at turn 15), at turn 16, \\(y = 9\\).\n- The requirement is that \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{16} = 9\\), so \\(15 + H - 1 = 16\\) gives \\(H = 2\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 15**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16).\n  - At turn 15, player is on freeway 8. Collision check: as above, safe.\n- **Turn 16**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\)).\n  - At turn 16, player is at \\(y = 9\\). Since freeway 9 has no cars (freeways only defined for \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), no collision occurs.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 2 - 1 = 16\\)) with \\(H = 2\\), the minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: S\n}",
