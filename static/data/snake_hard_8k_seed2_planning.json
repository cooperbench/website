        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to be careful with the internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles are at: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6). Let me list them clearly:\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nSnake positions: only the head at (3,3). So the snake is just one cell long. Head direction is left, so it was moving left to get to (3,3).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, and life span 10, which means they'll disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so they have 9 more turns after this.\n\nCurrent turn is t=0.\n\nI need to plan at least 5 turns ahead. Since the snake is only one cell, it can grow by eating food. But I have to avoid collisions and think long-term.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Up (U): (3,4) but (3,4) is an obstacle? No, obstacles are given: (3,4) is in the list. Let me check the obstacles: (3,4) is there, so I can't move up to (3,4).\n\nObstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nSo from (3,3):\n\n- Up: (3,4) is an obstacle, so not possible.\n\n- Down: (3,2) – is that within bounds? Walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so y=2 is between 1 and 6, x=3 is between 1 and 6. No obstacles mentioned at (3,2), so it should be free.\n\n- Left: (2,3) – (2,3) has food, but let's see if it's possible. x=2, y=3, within bounds. No obstacle at (2,3), I think. Obstacles are: (1,3), but (1,3) is different from (2,3). (1,3) is obstacle, (2,3) is not in obstacle list, so it should be free, but it has food.\n\n- Right: (4,3) – should be free, no obstacles or walls.\n\nBut head direction is left, so I can't instantly reverse to right. Reverse would be right, since left was the direction.\n\nCurrent direction is L (left), so moving right would be opposite, so I cannot move right on this turn because of no instant reverse rule.\n\nThe rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Since this is turn t=0, and we're deciding action for turn t=0, I think \"next turn\" refers to the immediate next move.\n\nLet me read: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo for turn t=0, current direction is L, so I cannot choose R for turn t=0 action.\n\nSimilarly, for subsequent turns, I need to consider the direction after each move.\n\nFor now, at turn 0:\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L, R but R is opposite to current L, so not allowed.\n\nU: to (3,4) but (3,4) is obstacle, so not possible.\n\nD: to (3,2) – possible, no obstacle.\n\nL: to (2,3) – possible, and it has food.\n\nBut L is to (2,3), which has food, value +1.\n\nSince snake is at (3,3), moving left to (2,3) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nThen snake would grow to length 2, with head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3)? When you eat food, the snake grows, so after eating, the tail stays in place until the next move, I think.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move on the turn it eats. But in this case, since the snake was length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2, with head at the new position and tail at the old position.\n\nThen on the next move, when it moves, the tail moves, so it doesn't stay.\n\nBut for collision, when moving, if head hits body, it dies, but since tail moves, it's ok to move to where tail was, as long as tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, at (2,3), if I move to (2,3), which has food, I eat it, snake grows to length 2: head at (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nNow, from there, I need to move.\n\nBut let's think about options.\n\nFirst, at (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: not possible, obstacle\n\n- D: (3,2) – empty, I think? No food mentioned, so empty cell.\n\n- L: (2,3) – has food, value +1\n\n- R: not possible, reverse direction forbidden.\n\nSo only D or L possible.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I eat the food, snake grows to length 2: positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nHead direction now would be L, since I moved left.\n\nNow, from (2,3), what can I do?\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U: (2,4) – is (2,4) obstacle? Yes, (2,4) is in obstacle list: (2,4) is internal obstacle.\n\n- D: (2,2) – should be free, no obstacle, no food mentioned.\n\n- L: (1,3) – but (1,3) is obstacle? Obstacle list has (1,3), so not possible.\n\n- R: (3,3) – but (3,3) is now the tail. Since tail will move when I move, it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nCurrent head position (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nIf I move right to (3,3), which is the tail. But at the moment of move, head moves to (3,3), which is occupied by tail, but since tail will also move (if the snake moves), but when you move, the head moves to new cell, and tail is removed only if no growth, but since I just ate, and I'm moving, I don't eat on this move, so tail should move.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=0: start at (3,3), move L to (2,3), eat food, grow to length 2: head at (2,3), tail at (3,3)\n\nNow turn t=1: I need to move from (2,3)\n\nOptions:\n\n- U: (2,4) obstacle, not possible\n\n- D: (2,2) free\n\n- L: (1,3) obstacle, not possible\n\n- R: (3,3) which is current tail position\n\nNow, when I move, if I move to (3,3), head goes to (3,3), but at that moment, (3,3) is occupied by tail. However, since the tail will move away after the head moves, in standard snake, it's not a collision because the tail leaves the cell as the head enters, but only if the head moves to the tail and the tail moves to a new position.\n\nIn this case, if I move right to (3,3), and the tail is at (3,3), but since the snake moves, the head goes to (3,3), and the tail is removed, so effectively, the cell is free after move. But during the move, when head enters (3,3), if tail is still there, it might be collision.\n\nI think I need to clarify the collision rule.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo yes, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away.\n\nSo in this case, moving to (3,3) is possible and not a collision.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is allowed.\n\nBut (3,3) might not be the tail in a longer snake, but here it is.\n\nNow, if I move to (3,3), no food there, so no growth, snake moves: head to (3,3), tail from (3,3) moves? Tail is at (3,3), head moves to (3,3), but that would be the same cell.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t=1, positions: head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\nIf I move right to (3,3):\n\n- Head moves to (3,3)\n\n- But (3,3) was tail, so when head moves to (3,3), since it's the tail, and tail will move to the next position, but in this case, since no growth, the tail segment is removed, so the new positions: head at (3,3), and since only one body segment, it disappears? No.\n\nSnake has two segments: index 0: head (2,3), index 1: tail (3,3)\n\nWhen moving, head moves to new position, and tail is removed if no food, so the body shrinks? No.\n\nStandard: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail is removed from its cell.\n\nSo if head moves to (3,3), which is the current position of the tail, but at the time of move, head moves to (3,3), and since (3,3) was occupied by tail, but tail is moving away to... in this case, the body segment at (3,3) is the last segment, so it will be removed, meaning the cell (3,3) is vacated, but head is moving to it simultaneously.\n\nThe key point is that it's not a collision because the tail leaves as the head arrives.\n\nSimilarly, here, moving to (3,3) should be fine, and after move, head is at (3,3), and since no body segment left (because tail was removed), but the snake should have only head now? That can't be right.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nInitial at t=0 after move: snake [(2,3), (3,3)] length 2.\n\nNow at t=1, move to (3,3):\n\n- Head from (2,3) moves to (3,3)\n\n- The body segment at (3,3) was the tail, so it is removed.\n\nBut where does the new tail come from? The body segment moves to the previous head position.\n\nPositions: segment 0: (2,3), segment 1: (3,3)\n\nWhen moving, new head position: (3,3)  // since we moved right\n\nThen the body segment 1 (tail) is removed, and the new body is segment 0 which was at (2,3) but it moves to where? The body segments shift: the first body segment (which was the head) becomes the neck, and moves to the new head position? No.\n\nStandard: the head moves to a new cell. Then each subsequent body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for segment 1 (the tail), it moves to the position of segment 0 (which was (2,3)).\n\nBut segment 0 is the head, which is moving to (3,3).\n\nSo before move: positions [ (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3): head at (3,3)\n\nThen body segment 1 (which was at (3,3)) should move to the previous position of segment 0, which was (2,3). But (2,3) is now free? Let's sequence:\n\n- Head was at (2,3), moves to (3,3). Now head is at (3,3).\n\n- The body segment that was at (3,3) (segment 1) needs to move. It moves to the position that segment 0 was at before the move, which is (2,3).\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,3), body at (2,3). So snake is [(3,3), (2,3)], length 2, head at (3,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) is the same cell, but positions are different.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3), head moved to (3,3), and tail moved to (2,3), so the snake is now head at (3,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nEffectively, it's as if the snake moved and the tail followed.\n\nIn this case, moving to the former tail position is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in general, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nBack to point.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move:\n\n- D to (2,2): free\n\n- R to (3,3): which is tail, but safe\n\nU and L not possible due to obstacles.\n\n(2,2) is empty, no food.\n\nIf I move to (2,2), no food, so snake moves: head to (2,2), tail to (2,3)? Positions: from [ (2,3), (3,3) ] move down to (2,2): head to (2,2), then body segment 1 moves to previous segment 0 position (2,3), so new snake [(2,2), (2,3)].\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) had food? No, food was eaten at turn 0, so no food there now.\n\nFood at (2,3) was eaten, so it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, other food remains.\n\nBut in this case, from (3,3) at turn 0, if I move L to (2,3), I eat food, grow to length 2, head at (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nThen at turn 1, I have to move, and I can go to (2,2) or (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is now free, since tail moved or something.\n\nAfter move to (2,3), tail at (3,3), so (3,3) is occupied.\n\nBut when I move from (2,3) to (3,3), as above, it becomes head at (3,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let's think about other options.\n\nAt turn 0, instead of moving L, I could move D to (3,2).\n\nThen no food eaten, snake still length 1, head at (3,2).\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2) and (2,5), etc.\n\nBut let's list all possible moves for the next few turns.\n\nFirst, since I need to plan 5 turns, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nCurrent turn t=0, position (3,3), direction L.\n\nPossible actions: D or L.\n\nIf I choose L: move to (2,3), eat food, grow to length 2. Snake: head (2,3), tail (3,3). Direction L.\n\nThen turn t=1, from (2,3), possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf move D to (2,2): no food, so snake moves to [(2,2), (2,3)]? Head to (2,2), tail from (3,3) moves to (2,3), so positions [(2,2), (2,3)], tail at (2,3).\n\nDirection now D.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) but (2,3) is tail, so can move there? But (2,3) is occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nAt (2,2), with tail at (2,3).\n\nMove U to (2,3): head moves to (2,3), which is current tail position. Then tail moves to previous head position (2,2), so new snake [(2,3), (2,2)], tail at (2,2).\n\nBut effectively, the snake is vertical at (2,2) and (2,3).\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut this might not be efficient.\n\nFrom (2,2), other moves: L to (1,2) or R to (3,2) or D to (2,1), etc.\n\n(1,2) has food, value +1.\n\nIf I move to (1,2), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn t=1 at (2,3), if I move R to (3,3), as before, snake to [(3,3), (2,3)], head at (3,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: U not possible (obstacle), D to (3,2), L to (2,3) which is tail, R to (4,3).\n\n(2,3) is tail, so moving L to (2,3) is possible and safe.\n\n(4,3) should be free.\n\nNow, let's consider the other choice at turn 0: move D to (3,2).\n\nAt turn 0, move D to (3,2), no food, snake still length 1, head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn t=1, from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3) but (3,3) was previous position, but since length 1, it's free now? When snake moves from (3,3) to (3,2), the cell (3,3) is vacated.\n\nSo positions: after move, head at (3,2), no tail.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), D to (3,1).\n\nAll should be possible, no obstacles nearby.\n\n(3,3) is free now, (2,2) free, etc.\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) and (2,5), but (2,5) is far.\n\nNow, I need to think about maximizing score and survival.\n\nFood at (2,3) is very close, and if I eat it, I grow, but then I might be in a tighter spot.\n\nSince the snake is short, eating food might be good to grow for more flexibility later.\n\nBut there are obstacles, so I need to navigate.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,2) is close to the wall and obstacles.\n\nList the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,3)\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFood: (1,2), (2,3), (2,5)\n\nAll with life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat immediately, grow to 2.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), then I can go to (1,2) to eat the food there, or to (3,2), etc.\n\n(1,2) has food, so from (2,2), moving left to (1,2) would eat it.\n\nThen snake grows to length 3.\n\nBut let's see if that's safe.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,5), which is above, but (2,4) is obstacle, so I can't go directly to (2,5) from (2,3) because (2,4) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,3), U is blocked, so I can't go up.\n\nSo to reach (2,5), I need to go around, like via (3,3) or other ways.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, x=2.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go up, but (3,4) obstacle, so no.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (3,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nI should consider the long-term path.\n\nSince I need to plan 5 turns, let's outline possible sequences.\n\nOption 1: Eat the close food first.\n\nTurn 0: Move L to (2,3), eat food, snake length 2, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 1: From (2,3), move D to (2,2), no food, so snake moves to [(2,2), (2,3)]  // head to (2,2), tail to (2,3)? Positions: after move, head at (2,2), body at (2,3), so [(2,2), (2,3)], tail at (2,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 2: From (2,2), move L to (1,2), eat food at (1,2), so grow to length 3. Positions: head at (1,2), body: previous head (2,2) and tail (2,3), so after eating, head at (1,2), body at (2,2), tail at (2,3). So [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, from (1,2), what can I do?\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,3) but (1,3) is obstacle, not possible.\n\nD to (1,1) – if within bounds. y=1, x=1, should be playable, no wall, but walls at y=0, so (1,1) is corner, should be ok, no obstacle mentioned.\n\nR to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, not tail. Tail is at (2,3), so (2,2) is body segment.\n\nIf I move to (2,2), which is body, it would be collision, since it's not the tail.\n\nPositions: head (1,2), body at (2,2) and (2,3)\n\nIf I move right to (2,2), that is occupied by the body segment, and it's not the tail, so it would be collision, die.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (1,3) obstacle, down to (1,1) possible, left not possible, x=1, left would be x=0, wall.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,1).\n\nMove D to (1,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (1,1), then body segments move: the first body (2,2) moves to (1,2), and tail (2,3) moves to (2,2). New positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\nNow at (1,1), I can move up to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, or right to (2,1), or down to (1,0) wall, left to (0,1) wall.\n\nSo only right to (2,1), if possible.\n\n(2,1) should be free.\n\nMove to (2,1), no food, etc.\n\nBut now I'm stuck in the bottom left, with few options, and food at (2,5) might be hard to reach.\n\nNot good for long-term.\n\nFrom turn 1, after eating at (2,3), instead of moving down, I could move right to (3,3).\n\nTurn 0: Move L to (2,3), eat, snake [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 1: Move R to (3,3), as before, head to (3,3), tail to (2,3), so snake [(3,3), (2,3)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow from (3,3), possible moves: D to (3,2), L to (2,3) which is tail, so can move, or R to (4,3)\n\nU not possible (obstacle).\n\nIf move L to (2,3), head to (2,3), which is tail, then tail moves to (3,3), so snake [(2,3), (3,3)] again, same as before, not progress.\n\nBetter to move D or R.\n\nSay move D to (3,2), no food, snake moves to [(3,2), (3,3)]? Head to (3,2), body to (3,3), so [(3,2), (3,3)], tail at (3,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (3,1), (2,2), (4,2), or up to (3,3) which is tail.\n\n(3,3) is tail, so moving up to (3,3) is possible.\n\nBut let's see other food.\n\nFood at (2,5) is at (2,5), but to reach it, I need to go around obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), I can go to (4,2) or (2,2), etc.\n\n(2,2) is free, no food.\n\nThen from (2,2) to (1,2) to eat, but (1,2) has food.\n\nIf I go to (1,2) from (2,2), I can eat it.\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nNow, the food at (2,5) might be eaten by someone else, but since I'm the only snake, it's fine, but I need to get there before life span ends, but life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut let's consider not eating the close food at turn 0.\n\nAt turn 0, move D to (3,2) instead of L.\n\nTurn 0: Move D to (3,2), no food, snake length 1, head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn t=1, from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), D to (3,1).\n\nAll possible.\n\nNow, food at (1,2) is close, so I could go to (2,2) then to (1,2).\n\nOr food at (2,3) is still there, but if I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later or disappear, but life span 10, so it will be there for 9 more turns after this.\n\nCurrent turn t=0, food life span 10, so it disappears after turn 10, meaning on turn 11 it's gone. So from turn 0 to turn 10, it exists, can be eaten on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating all food is good, but I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, the snake is short, so tail is close, but let's see if it applies.\n\nFor example, if head and tail are adjacent, and tail cell has food, but in this grid, the tail cell doesn't have food unless food is there.\n\nBut in our case, no food under body yet.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating at (2,3) immediately because it puts me near obstacles with limited moves.\n\nIf I move down first to (3,2), I have more options.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (2,2), then to (1,2) to eat, or to (4,2), etc.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 0: Move D to (3,2), no eat, snake at (3,2), dir D.\n\nTurn 1: Move L to (2,2), no food (assume), snake at (2,2), dir L.\n\nTurn 2: Move L to (1,2), eat food, grow to length 2. Positions: head (1,2), tail (2,2)  // since previous head was (2,2), and no other body.\n\nSnake length 1 at (2,2), move to (1,2), eat, so now head (1,2), tail (2,2).\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow from (1,2), as before, only can move D to (1,1), since U obstacle, R body, L wall, D down.\n\nMove D to (1,1), no food, snake moves: head to (1,1), tail to (1,2), so [(1,1), (1,2)]\n\nDir D.\n\nThen from (1,1), can move R to (2,1), or U to (1,2) body, etc. Only R to (2,1).\n\nMove to (2,1), no food, snake to [(2,1), (1,1)], and so on.\n\nStill stuck.\n\nTo reach (2,5), I need to go via other paths.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2), then up to (4,3), but (4,3) is free? Obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (4,3) not listed, so free.\n\nThen to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at x=2, y=5, and (2,4) is obstacle, so I need to go to (3,5) or something.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (2,3) but then move in a way to go around.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 0, move D to (3,2), then turn 1 move U to (3,3), but (3,3) is free now, no food, so move to (3,3), no eat, snake at (3,3), dir U.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) to eat the food there, or D to (3,2), or R to (4,3).\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), eat food, grow to length 2: head (2,3), tail (3,3).\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut now I have the option to go to (4,3) first.\n\nTurn 0: Move D to (3,2), no eat, pos (3,2), dir D.\n\nTurn 1: Move R to (4,2), no food, pos (4,2), dir R.\n\nTurn 2: Move U to (4,3), no food, pos (4,3), dir U.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is previous, might be free.\n\n(4,4) free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free? (6,3) obstacle, but (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\nBut food at (2,5), so I need to go left and up.\n\nFrom (4,3), move L to (3,3), no food, pos (3,3), dir L.\n\nThen from (3,3), move L to (2,3) to eat, but (2,3) has food, so move to (2,3), eat, grow to length 2: head (2,3), tail (3,3).\n\nNow at (2,3), U blocked, so move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3) tail.\n\nIf move D to (2,2), then to (1,2) to eat, but then stuck.\n\nFrom (2,3), move R to (3,3), tail, so head to (3,3), tail to (2,3), so [(3,3), (2,3)], then from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,5), I need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,3), U blocked, so I can't go up directly.\n\nI need to go to (3,2) or (4,3), then to (3,1) or (4,4), etc.\n\n(2,5) is isolated because (2,4) blocked, (1,4) blocked, (1,3) blocked, so to reach (2,5), I must come from above or below, but below (2,4) blocked, so only from left, right, or above.\n\n(2,5) adjacent cells: U (2,6), D (2,4) obstacle, L (1,5), R (3,5).\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5, but (1,4) and (1,6) obstacles, but (1,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) free.\n\n(2,6) free? y=6, x=2, walls at y=7, so (2,6) is playable, no obstacle listed, so free.\n\nSo to reach (2,5), I can come from (1,5), (3,5), or (2,6).\n\nFor example, from (3,5) or (1,5).\n\nNow, from current position, how to get there.\n\nPerhaps I should head towards (2,5) directly, eating on the way.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating is good, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 0, if I don't eat at (2,3), I can go to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (1,2) to eat, but as before, I get stuck.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (4,2), then to (4,3), then to (4,4), then to (3,4) but (3,4) obstacle, not possible.\n\n(4,4) to (3,4) not possible.\n\nFrom (4,3), move U to (4,4), then from (4,4), can move U to (4,5), L to (3,4) obstacle, R to (5,4), D to (4,3).\n\nSo move U to (4,5), for example.\n\n(4,5) is at y=5.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), then to (2,5) to eat.\n\n(2,5) has food.\n\nSo let's outline this path.\n\nStart at (3,3), turn 0: move D to (3,2), no eat, pos (3,2), dir D.\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2), no eat, pos (4,2), dir R.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3), no eat, pos (4,3), dir U.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,4), no eat, pos (4,4), dir U.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (4,5), no eat, pos (4,5), dir U.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5), no eat, pos (3,5), dir L.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,5), eat food, grow.\n\nBut this is more than 5 turns, and I didn't eat any food yet, but I can eat on the way if possible.\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat the food at (1,2) or (2,3), but they might disappear, but life span 10, so by turn 6, it's turn 6, food spawned at t=0, life span 10, so disappears after turn 10, so on turn 6 it's still there, but I'm not near it.\n\nIn this path, at turn 2, I'm at (4,3), which is far from (2,3) or (1,2).\n\nBut I can modify to eat (2,3) first.\n\nFor example, turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,3)  // back, but possible\n\nThen turn 2: move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nThen at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), then L to (1,2) to eat, but then stuck.\n\nFrom (2,3), move R to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut when I move R to (3,3), it's the tail, so I go to (3,3), then from there to (4,3), etc.\n\nThen I can go to (4,5) and to (2,5).\n\nBut let's see the grid with obstacles to find a safe path to (2,5) that allows eating multiple food.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (1,2) and (2,3) and (2,5), but (1,2) is in a corner.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 0, move D to (3,2), then turn 1 move L to (2,2), turn 2 move L to (1,2) eat, then from (1,2) move D to (1,1), then turn 3 move R to (2,1), turn 4 move U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body? After eating at (1,2), snake is head (1,2), tail (2,2).\n\nMove D to (1,1): head to (1,1), tail to (1,2), so [(1,1), (1,2)]\n\nThen move R to (2,1): head to (2,1), tail to (1,1), so [(2,1), (1,1)]\n\nThen move U to (2,2): head to (2,2), tail to (2,1)? Positions: head from (2,1) move U to (2,2), no food, so tail moves to (2,1)? Body: segment 0 was (2,1), moves to (2,2), but that's the new head position? No.\n\nPositions before move: head (2,1), body (1,1) // only one body segment.\n\nAfter move head to (2,2), body moves to previous head position (2,1), so new snake [(2,2), (2,1)], tail at (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) but (2,3) has food, so move U to (2,3), eat, grow to length 3: head (2,3), body (2,2), tail (2,1)? After eating, head at (2,3), body segments: previous head (2,2) and tail (2,1), so [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]\n\nNow at (2,3), U blocked, so I can move D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision, or L to (1,3) obstacle, or R to (3,3).\n\nSo only R to (3,3), which is free.\n\nMove to (3,3), no food, snake moves: head to (3,3), body (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Let's see: positions before move: head (2,3), body (2,2), tail (2,1)\n\nMove head to (3,3), then body (2,2) moves to previous head position (2,3), and tail (2,1) moves to previous body position (2,2), so new positions: head (3,3), body (2,3), tail (2,2)\n\nSo [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move D to (3,2), or R to (4,3), etc.\n\nThen I can proceed to (4,3), (4,4), etc. to reach (2,5) later.\n\nBut this way, I have eaten two food: (1,2) and (2,3), and I can go for (2,5).\n\nBut for the first 5 turns, I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions for turns 0,1,2,3,4, since t1=0, so turns 0 to 4.\n\n5 turns: turn 0 to turn 4.\n\nIn the path above, turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 2: move L to (1,2) eat\n\nTurn 3: move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 5: move U to (2,2), but turn 4 is last for now.\n\nAt turn 4, I'm at (2,1), and I can move U to (2,2) on turn 5, but I need only up to turn 4 for the answer? No, the answer should include actions for turn t1 to t1+4, so 5 actions: turn 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nTurn 4 action.\n\nIn this case, at turn 4, I'm at (1,1), moving to (2,1), so position (2,1), and I can plan turn 4 action, but for the sequence, I have actions for turn 0 to 4.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: L (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 2: L (to (1,2) eat)\n\nTurn 3: D (to (1,1))\n\nTurn 4: R (to (2,1))\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2) etc.\n\nBut at turn 4, I'm moving to (2,1), which is fine.\n\nFrom the beginning, I could go directly towards (2,5) with eating on the way.\n\nFor example, turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 1: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (4,5)\n\nThen at (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) on turn 5, then to (2,5) on turn 6.\n\nBut in this, I didn't eat any food in 5 turns, so score 0 so far.\n\nWhereas in the other path, I ate one or two food.\n\nIn the first path with eating, at turn 2 I ate (1,2), and at turn 4 I'm at (2,1), with one food eaten.\n\nIn the path where I ate (2,3) first, I ate one food by turn 0.\n\nThen at turn 4, I could be somewhere else.\n\nBut let's compare.\n\nOption A: Eat (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: L to (2,3) eat\n\nThen turn 1: D to (2,2) no eat\n\nTurn 2: L to (1,2) eat (if I go that way)\n\nAt turn 2, from (2,2), move L to (1,2) eat, so positions after turn 2: head (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\nThen turn 3: D to (1,1) no eat\n\nTurn 4: R to (2,1) no eat\n\nSo by turn 4, I ate two food, length 3.\n\nPosition at turn 4 end: (2,1)\n\nOption B: Don't eat at turn 0, move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2) no eat\n\nTurn 2: move L to (1,2) eat\n\nTurn 3: D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 4: R to (2,1)\n\nSame as above, but I ate at turn 2 instead of turn 0, but same number of food eaten by turn 4.\n\nIn option A, I ate at turn 0 and turn 2, in option B, I ate only at turn 2, so option A has one more food.\n\nIn option A: turn 0 eat (2,3), turn 2 eat (1,2), so two food by turn 2.\n\nIn option B: turn 0 no eat, turn 2 eat (1,2), so only one food by turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4 end, in both cases I'm at (2,1) in this path.\n\nBut in option A, I ate earlier.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating sooner is better, but also for survival, but here no immediate danger.\n\nIn option A, after eating at (2,3), I moved down to (2,2) on turn 1, then to (1,2) on turn 2.\n\nIn option B, I moved to (3,2) on turn 0, then to (2,2) on turn 1, then to (1,2) on turn 2, so I ate at turn 2.\n\nSo option A has two food by turn 2, option B has one by turn 2.\n\nSo better to eat at turn 0.\n\nBut in option A, after eating at (2,3), I could have moved differently.\n\nFor example, turn 0: L to (2,3) eat\n\nTurn 1: R to (3,3) no eat (move to tail position)\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 2: move D to (3,2) no eat, positions head (3,2), body (3,3)? After move: head to (3,2), tail to (3,3), so [(3,2), (3,3)]\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (4,2) no eat? From (3,2), move R to (4,2), head to (4,2), tail to (3,2), so [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (4,3) no eat, head to (4,3), tail to (4,2), so [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nThen I can continue to (4,4) etc.\n\nBut I ate only one food so far.\n\nWorse than eating two.\n\nSo the first path is better.\n\nTo reach (2,5), I need to go from the bottom or from the side.\n\nFor long-term survival, after eating (1,2) and (2,3), I can go to the right and up to reach (2,5).\n\nFor example, from (2,1) at turn 4, move U to (2,2) on turn 5, but (2,2) might be body or free.\n\nIn the sequence where I have [(2,1), (1,1)] at turn 4 end, but in option A, at turn 4 end, after moving to (2,1), positions are [(2,1), (1,1)] for the snake if I didn't eat again, but in the eating path, when I moved to (2,1) on turn 4, no eat, so snake is head (2,1), tail (1,1), length 2.\n\nThen turn 5: move U to (2,2), no food, so head to (2,2), tail to (2,1), so [(2,2), (2,1)]\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (2,3), but (2,3) may have food or not, but food was eaten, so no, move to (2,3), no food, head to (2,3), tail to (2,2), so [(2,3), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc. as before.\n\nThen to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5) to eat.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut for now, for the first 5 turns, I can do the sequence that eats two food.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 0: L to (2,3) eat\n\nTurn 1: D to (2,2) no eat\n\nTurn 2: L to (1,2) eat\n\nTurn 3: D to (1,1) no eat\n\nTurn 4: R to (2,1) no eat\n\nActions: Turn 0: L, Turn 1: D, Turn 2: L, Turn 3: D, Turn 4: R\n\nBut at turn 2, when I move L to (1,2), I eat, so I grow.\n\nNow, is there a way to eat the third food? (2,5) is far, so not in 5 turns.\n\nPerhaps from turn 1, after eating at (2,3), instead of moving down, I could move right, but then I might not eat (1,2) soon.\n\nBut (1,2) is closer, so better to eat it.\n\nAnother food is at (2,5), but it's at y=5, I'm at y=2 or 1, so need multiple moves.\n\nSo for short term, eating the two close food is good.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAt (1,2), after eating, I have to move down because no other choice, which is fine.\n\nAlso, the life span is long, so (2,5) can be eaten later.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output 5 actions.\n\nBut the head direction: at turn 0, direction is L, I move L, so new direction L.\n\nTurn 1, from (2,3), I move D, so direction down.\n\nTurn 2, from (2,2), move L to (1,2), direction left.\n\nTurn 3, from (1,2), move D, direction down.\n\nTurn 4, from (1,1), move R to (2,1), direction right.\n\nAll valid.\n\nIf I want to avoid the corner, I could not eat (1,2) immediately, but then I might not eat it at all if I go away.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,5) first, (1,2) might disappear after turn 10, but since I can be there before, it's ok.\n\nBut in 5 turns, I can be at (4,5) without eating, or at (2,1) with two food eaten, so better to have the food.\n\nMoreover, with two food, snake length 3, I have more flexibility later.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let's check if all moves are safe.\n\nAt no point do I collide with wall or body.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, moving from (1,2) to (1,1), (1,1) is within bounds, no obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: at turn 1, from (2,3), direction was L (from previous move), I move D, not opposite.\n\nOpposite of L is R, I moved D, not opposite.\n\nTurn 2, from (2,2), previous direction D (since moved down to (2,2)), I move L, not opposite (opposite would be U).\n\nTurn 3, from (1,2), previous direction L (moved left to (1,2)), I move D, not opposite.\n\nTurn 4, from (1,1), previous direction D (moved down to (1,1)? At turn 3, I moved from (1,2) to (1,1), so direction D.\n\nThen move R to (2,1), not opposite (opposite U).\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: L\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nAlso, for turn t1=0, so:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: L\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, which I did, as I considered going to (2,5) later.\n\nPerhaps I can include one more action to show, but the output is only for 5 turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nSo for t1=0, output turns 0 to 4.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate two food, which is good.\n\nIf I move differently at turn 1.\n\nAfter turn 0 eat at (2,3), at turn 1 move R to (3,3) instead of D.\n\nThen turn 1: R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 2: D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3: R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 4: U to (4,3)\n\nThen I have only one food eaten, and position (4,3), which is fine, but I missed the food at (1,2), which is closer.\n\nSo better to eat (1,2) as well.\n\nTherefore, the first sequence is better.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the accessible positive food efficiently and avoiding dead ends. The snake starts at (3,3) with direction left. The closest food is at (2,3), which should be eaten immediately on turn 0 to gain a point and increase length. From there, the snake moves down to (2,2) to position itself for eating the food at (1,2). After eating at (1,2) on turn 2, the snake must move down to (1,1) as it is the only safe direction due to obstacles and walls. Then, to escape the bottom-left corner, the snake moves right to (2,1) on turn 4. This sequence eats two food items in the first 5 turns, growing the snake to length 3, and sets up for future movement towards the food at (2,5) by heading right and then up in subsequent turns.\n\nKey considerations:\n- **Turn 0**: Moving left to (2,3) eats the food (+1 point, length increases to 2). No reverse move (right) is allowed due to the current left direction.\n- **Turn 1**: Moving down to (2,2) avoids obstacles and positions for the next food. The cell (2,2) is free.\n- **Turn 2**: Moving left to (1,2) eats the food (+1 point, length increases to 3). Only down is possible afterward due to obstacles.\n- **Turn 3**: Moving down to (1,1) is the only safe move; no collision risk.\n- **Turn 4**: Moving right to (2,1) begins exiting the corner. The snake can later move up to (2,2) or right to (3,1) to reach the food at (2,5) via a path like (3,5) -> (2,5).\n- **Long-term (beyond 5 turns)**: After turn 4, the snake should move up to (2,2) on turn 5, then right to (3,2), and proceed to (4,2), (4,3), etc., to reach (2,5) by approximately turn 8-10 while avoiding obstacles. All food has a life span of 10, so (2,5) can be eaten before it disappears. Survival is prioritized by avoiding the trapped corner early and maintaining maneuverability.\n\nAll moves adhere to movement constraints:\n- No instant reverse: E.g., from direction left (turn 0), moving down (turn 1) is not opposite.\n- No collisions: The tail move is handled safely (e.g., moving to tail positions is allowed as the tail moves away), and obstacles/walls are avoided.\n\nActions for turns 0 to 4:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 1: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 2: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 3: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6). I should list all blocked cells to avoid.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,2), body at (2,3). So the snake is only two segments long right now. Head direction is down (D), meaning it was moving down to get to (2,2) from... since positions are head first, and it was at (2,3) before, so from (2,3) to (2,2) is down, which matches the direction D.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 8\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1. Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including current turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n\nCurrent turn is 2.\n\nFood at (1,2): life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 2 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify life span countdown.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is available for L turns starting from now, including the current turn.\n\nFor (1,2): life span 8 at turn 2, so it will be available until turn 9 inclusive? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 2, countdown is 8, so after this turn (turn 2), countdown becomes 7. After turn 3, 6, and so on, until after turn 9, countdown 0, and it disappears before turn 10? I need to be precise.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. So at the end of turn t, if life span was L, it becomes L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nFor example, food with life span 1: available only on the current turn, disappears after.\n\nLife span 2: available on current and next turn, disappears after.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,2) at turn 2, life span 8: available from turn 2 to turn 9 (since after turn 9, it would be 0 and disappear).\n\nTurn 2: life span 8\n\nAfter turn 2: life span 7\n\nAfter turn 3: 6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 8: life span 1\n\nAfter turn 9: life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSo available on turns 2 through 9 inclusive. That's 8 turns.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(2,5): life span 8, available turns 2-9\n\n(2,6): life span 9, available turns 2-10\n\nNow, snake head at (2,2), direction down, so it can move down, left, or right? But no instant reverse, so it can't move up because that would be opposite to down.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so possible moves: down, left, right. Up is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nThe grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nSnake body: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nFood at (1,2), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(1,2) is adjacent to head? Head at (2,2), so (1,2) is left of head.\n\nBut (1,2) has food, and it's a different cell.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (2,2), direction down.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U (up): to (2,3) but (2,3) is currently the tail. Since the tail will move, moving to (2,3) might be okay if the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nHere, head at (2,2), tail at (2,3), so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nThe tail cell (2,3) has no food, I think. Food is at (1,2), (2,5), (2,6), not at (2,3). So moving to (2,3) should be safe because after moving, the head goes to (2,3), and tail was at (2,3) but moves to... let's see what happens.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to (2,3), which was the tail position, then the tail would need to move, but since it's only two segments, the body segment at (2,3) would become the new tail, but since head is moving to (2,3), which is where the tail was, after move, head is at (2,3), and the old tail position is vacated, but there is no new position for tail since it's only two segments. With two segments, if head moves to the tail position, it should be okay, because the tail will be gone or moved.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment follows to the previous position.\n\nFor two segments: head at A, tail at B.\n\nIf head moves to C, then new head at C, new tail at A.\n\nBut if head moves to B (the current tail position), then new head at B, and since the tail was at B, but B is now head, the tail should move to where? In this case, since the head is moving to the tail's position, the tail disappears or moves to the previous head position? I think in this context, when head moves to the tail cell, it's allowed because the tail will move away to the previous position.\n\nFor example, positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3). If head moves up to (2,3), then new head is at (2,3), and the body segment (which was tail) now becomes part of body, but since only one body segment, the new tail should be at the previous head position, (2,2)? But (2,2) is now empty.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,3), and the segment that was at (2,3) is now the tail, but it stays or moves? In snake, when head moves, the tail end moves forward only if the snake doesn't eat, but here if it doesn't eat, the tail moves to the next position.\n\nGenerally: when snake moves without eating, head goes to new position, each body segment shifts to the position of the segment in front, so the tail moves to where the second last segment was.\n\nWith two segments: positions [H, T]. H at P, T at Q.\n\nMove head to R.\n\nIf R is not food, then new positions: head at R, tail at P (which was H position).\n\nIf head moves to Q (T position), then new head at Q, and since T was at Q, and H was at P, the new tail should be at P, because the body segment moves to the previous head position.\n\nSo new snake: head at Q, tail at P.\n\nIn this case, from [ (2,2), (2,3) ], if head moves to (2,3), which is Q, then new head at (2,3), new tail at (2,2). So the snake is now at [ (2,3) ]? No, positions should be two cells: head at (2,3), and tail at (2,2). So it reversed, but it's valid.\n\nAnd no collision because the cell (2,3) is now head, and (2,2) is tail, no body collision.\n\nMoreover, since no food eaten, length same.\n\nNow, in this state, food at (1,2), (2,5), (2,6), none at (2,3) or (2,2), so moving to (2,3) is fine.\n\nBut direction: moving up to (2,3) from (2,2) with current direction down. But moving up is opposite to down, so it might be instant reverse.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is down, so moving up would be opposite, so it's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, from (2,2) with direction down, possible moves are: down, left, right. Up is invalid.\n\nSo actions: D, L, R.\n\nNow, coordinates: (x,y), with U increasing y, D decreasing y? Let's check.\n\n\"U`(x,y+1)`\" so U: up, y increases.\n\nD: down, y decreases.\n\nL: left, x decreases.\n\nR: right, x increases.\n\nAnd walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nAlso, head at (2,2), which is not wall.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,2):\n\n- Down (D): to (2,1). Is (2,1) valid? y=1, not border (y=0 is border), and no internal obstacle listed, so should be free. But y=0 is wall, y=1 is not.\n\n- Left (L): to (1,2). (1,2) has food, but let's see if it's accessible. (1,2) is not wall, no obstacle mentioned, so should be free.\n\n- Right (R): to (3,2). (3,2) is not wall, no obstacle, so free.\n\nNow, (1,2) has food, as per food list.\n\nBut moving to (1,2) would eat the food, since head moves to food cell.\n\nFood at (1,2), value +1, so eating it increases length by 1.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new head at (1,2), and tail stays where it was, so positions become [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nIf head moves to (1,2) and eats food, then new head at (1,2), the body segment at (2,2) remains, and tail at (2,3) remains, so new positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), then (2,3). Length 3.\n\nIf no eat, positions: head to new position, tail moves to old head position.\n\nBut here, with eat, tail doesn't move.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: here, no food on tail, so safe.\n\nNow, other moves: down to (2,1) or right to (3,2), no food there.\n\nBut (2,1) might be safe, (3,2) safe.\n\nBut I should consider goals: maximize score, so I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nNow, there is food at (2,5) and (2,6), which are above, but head is at (2,2), direction down, so to go up, I need to change direction.\n\nCurrently, I can only move D, L, R.\n\nIf I move left to (1,2), I eat the food immediately, score +1, snake length 3.\n\nBut is it safe? (1,2) might have risks.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid around.\n\nLet me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0-7, y 0-7.\n\nWalls: borders and internal.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nHead at (2,2)\n\nFood at (1,2), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(2,5) and (2,6) are on the same column, above.\n\nBut there are obstacles: (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), etc.\n\nFor example, (2,4) is an obstacle, which is directly above (2,2) at y=4.\n\n(2,2) to (2,5) is blocked by (2,4) obstacle? (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot go to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) and (1,4) obstacles.\n\nSo to reach (2,5) or (2,6), I need to go around.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 move.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Move Left (L) to (1,2): eat food, grow to length 3, positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3). Direction now left? After moving left from down, new direction is left.\n\n2. Move Down (D) to (2,1): no food, positions: head (2,1), tail (2,2) (since no eat, tail moves to old head). Direction down.\n\n3. Move Right (R) to (3,2): no food, positions: head (3,2), tail (2,2). Direction right.\n\nI need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: all have long life, 8 or 9, so no immediate decay.\n\nBut (1,2) is close, so eating it might be good, but I should consider if it leads to dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving left to eat (1,2).\n\nAfter move L to (1,2), snake: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3). Length 3.\n\nDirection: since moved left, new direction left.\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse. Current direction left, so cannot move right (opposite).\n\nSo moves: U (up, to (1,3)), D (down, to (1,1)), L (left, to (0,2)) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (0,2): x=0 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n\nU to (1,3): but (1,3) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,3), yes, from list: (1,3) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nD to (1,1): is (1,1) free? Not border, not in obstacle list, obstacles are: (1,6), (1,4), (1,3), etc. (1,1) not listed, so free.\n\nR to (2,2): but that's the body position, and also opposite direction? Current direction left, moving right is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo from (1,2), with direction left, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,3) but obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: to (1,1), valid, no food\n\n- L: to (0,2), wall, invalid\n\n- R: opposite, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,1).\n\nForced move to (1,1).\n\nThen at (1,1), after moving down, direction down.\n\nNow positions: after moving from (1,2) to (1,1), eating? No, (1,1) no food, so snake moves: head to (1,1), body from (2,2) to (1,2)? Let's trace.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nHead moves to (1,1), no eat, so new head at (1,1), body segments shift: the segment at (1,2) moves to where? Positions: index 0: head, 1: body, 2: tail.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell not food, head goes to new position, segment 1 goes to previous position of head, segment 2 goes to previous position of segment 1.\n\nSo previous positions: head at (1,2), segment 1 at (2,2), segment 2 at (2,3)\n\nHead moves to (1,1), not food.\n\nNew positions: head at (1,1)\n\nSegment 1 moves to previous head position (1,2)\n\nSegment 2 moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (2,2)\n\nSo new snake: head (1,1), then (1,2), then (2,2). Tail at (2,2), but (2,3) is gone? Segment 2 was at (2,3), now moves to (2,2).\n\nPositions: [ (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nNow, head at (1,1), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,1), direction down.\n\nCannot move up (opposite).\n\nMoves:\n\n- D: down to (1,0), but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- L: left to (0,1), x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R: right to (2,1), possible? (2,1) is free? Not wall, not obstacle.\n\n- U: up to (1,2), but (1,2) is now body position, and also opposite direction? Direction down, moving up is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move: right to (2,1).\n\nMove to (2,1).\n\nNo food there.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,1), not food.\n\nPrevious positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\nHead moves to (2,1), new head (2,1)\n\nSegment 1 moves to previous head (1,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (1,2)\n\nSo new snake: [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) ]\n\nHead at (2,1), direction right (since moved right from down? From (1,1) to (2,1) is right, so direction right.\n\nNow at (2,1), direction right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: up to (2,2), but (2,2) is now body? Current positions: head (2,1), body (1,1), tail (1,2)\n\n(2,2) is not occupied, I think. Positions are (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), so (2,2) is free.\n\nU to (2,2): possible? (2,2) not wall, not obstacle.\n\nBut direction: moving up from right? Current direction right, moving up is not opposite, opposite would be left.\n\nDirections: R and L opposite, U and D opposite.\n\nSo from right, can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nHere, move U to (2,2): (2,2) is free, no food.\n\nOr D to (2,0), y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (3,2), possible.\n\nL to (1,1), but (1,1) is body position, and also opposite? Moving left from right is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U to (2,2) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf U to (2,2), no food, positions: head to (2,2), body to (2,1)? Previous positions: head (2,1), segment1 (1,1), segment2 (1,2)\n\nHead moves to (2,2), not food, new head (2,2), segment1 to (2,1), segment2 to (1,1) — previous position of segment1 was (1,1), so segment2 to (1,1)\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ]\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (3,2), head to (3,2), segment1 to (2,1)? Previous head (2,1), so segment1 to (2,1), but (2,1) is occupied? No, positions: after move, head to (3,2), segment1 to previous head (2,1), segment2 to previous segment1 (1,1)\n\nNew positions: [ (3,2), (2,1), (1,1) ]\n\nBut (1,1) is the tail.\n\nNow, this seems messy, and we are at turn 4 or so, and we have food above at (2,5) and (2,6), but we are stuck in the bottom left.\n\nMoreover, from (2,1), if I go to (2,2), I can then try to go up, but (2,3) might be free, but let's see obstacles.\n\n(2,3): is it obstacle? Obstacles: (1,3), (2,4), etc. (2,3) not listed, so free.\n\nBut from (2,2), I can go up to (2,3), but let's not get ahead.\n\nThe point is, by moving left to eat (1,2) at turn 2, I ended up in a corner with limited moves, and I might not be able to reach the other food easily, and risk getting stuck.\n\nFor example, after being at (2,1), if I go to (2,2), then from (2,2) direction up? After moving U to (2,2) from (2,1), direction up.\n\nThen at (2,2), can move U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, L to (1,2) but (1,2) might be body or not, depending.\n\nIn the positions [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ], so (1,2) is free.\n\nFrom (2,2) direction up, possible moves: U to (2,3), D opposite invalid, L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is free, no food.\n\nBut (2,3) is free.\n\nHowever, to reach (2,5), I need to go up, but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly up from (2,3) to (2,4), since (2,4) blocked.\n\nSo I need to go around, but there are obstacles at (1,3), (1,4), etc., so it might be tricky.\n\nPerhaps moving left at turn 2 is risky because it traps me in the bottom left with few options.\n\nNow, alternative: move down to (2,1) at turn 2.\n\nFrom (2,2) move D to (2,1), no food.\n\nThen positions: head to (2,1), tail to (2,2) (since no eat, tail moves to old head).\n\nNew snake: head (2,1), tail (2,2). Direction down.\n\nThen from (2,1), direction down, possible moves: D to (2,0) wall invalid, L to (1,1), R to (3,1), U to (2,2) but opposite? Direction down, moving up opposite, invalid.\n\nSo moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) free, (3,1) free.\n\nIf move L to (1,1), similar to before, might get stuck.\n\nIf move R to (3,1), then to (3,1), direction right or down? Moved right from down, so direction right.\n\nThen from (3,1), can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nBut similar, I need to go up to reach food.\n\nBut food at (2,5) and (2,6), which are at y=5,6, I am at y=1, so far.\n\nMove right at turn 2 to (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,2) move R to (3,2), no food.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), tail (2,2). Direction right.\n\nFrom (3,2), direction right, moves: R to (4,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L opposite invalid.\n\n(4,2) free, (3,3) free, (3,1) free.\n\nNow, I can start moving up or something.\n\nBut I want to eat food, so (1,2) is close, but if I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later or I can come back, but with life span 8, it will be there for a while.\n\n(2,5) and (2,6) are above.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so I need to go around to reach them.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), then to (3,4), but (3,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,4) is listed, yes, so (3,4) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) blocked.\n\nSo to reach (2,5), I need to go to (1,5) or (3,5) or something.\n\n(1,5): but (1,4) and (1,6) obstacles, (1,5) might be free? Obstacles: (1,4), (1,6), but (1,5) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) free.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), surrounded? (2,4) obstacle below, (2,6) above, but (2,6) has food, not obstacle.\n\nPositions: (2,5) has food, (2,6) has food, but (2,4) obstacle, so from (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or to sides, but (1,5) or (3,5).\n\nSimilarly for (2,6).\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (1,2) immediately because it leads to a dead end.\n\nInstead, move down or right to have more space.\n\nBut moving down to (2,1) might also lead to bottom, similar issue.\n\nMove right to (3,2) at turn 2.\n\nThen from there, I can move up to (3,3), for example.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2)\n\nSnake: head (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nDirection right.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3) or D to (3,1) or R to (4,2)\n\nNow, I should aim for the food at (2,5) or (2,6).\n\nBut to reach (2,5), I need to go to x=2, y=5.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go up to (3,3), then to (3,4) but (3,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) is free, as not obstacle.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, blocked.\n\nSo I need to go to (1,3) but (1,3) obstacle, blocked.\n\nOr to (3,3) from (2,3), but that's horizontal.\n\nPerhaps go to (1,2) from (2,2) but (2,2) is tail now.\n\nLet's think of a path to (2,5).\n\nSince (2,4) blocked, I can go to (1,5) or (3,5) first.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), direction up, can move U to (3,4) but (3,4) obstacle invalid, L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D opposite invalid.\n\nSo move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3)\n\nSay move L to (2,3)\n\nAt (2,3), direction left (since moved left from up? From (3,3) to (2,3) is left, so direction left.\n\nThen from (2,3), direction left, moves: L to (1,3) but (1,3) obstacle invalid, R to (3,3) opposite invalid, U to (2,4) obstacle invalid, D to (2,2) which may be free.\n\nD to (2,2): (2,2) is not occupied, since snake is at (2,3) and head, tail was at (2,2) but moved.\n\nPositions: after moving to (2,3), previous head at (3,3), tail at (2,2)? Let's trace.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2), snake [ (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,3), not food, so new head (3,3), body to previous head (3,2), tail to previous body? Only two segments, so new positions: head (3,3), tail (3,2)\n\nPositions: [ (3,3), (3,2) ] tail at (3,2)\n\nThen move L to (2,3): from (3,3) to (2,3) left, not food, so new head (2,3), body to (3,3), tail to (3,2)? New positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), tail (3,2)\n\nAt (2,3), direction left.\n\nMoves: L to (1,3) obstacle, invalid; R to (3,3) but (3,3) is body position, and also opposite direction, invalid; U to (2,4) obstacle invalid; D to (2,2) free.\n\nSo only move D to (2,2).\n\nThen to (2,2), direction down.\n\nThen from (2,2), can move D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is tail? Positions: after moving to (2,2), new head (2,2), body to (2,3)? Previous positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), tail (3,2)\n\nHead moves to (2,2), not food, so new head (2,2), body segment moves to previous head position (2,3), tail segment moves to previous body position (3,3)\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nHead at (2,2), direction down.\n\nNow I am at (2,2) with a longer snake, but still need to reach the food above.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move L to (1,2) to eat the food, which is still there.\n\n(1,2) food, life span 8, turn 2, so at turn 4, life span left 6, still available.\n\nMove L to (1,2), eat food, grow to length 4.\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nDirection left.\n\nThen from (1,2), as before, only move down to (1,1), then to (2,1), etc., same as initial problem, stuck in bottom left.\n\nIf from (2,2) move R to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by tail? Positions have (3,3) and (3,2)? Current positions [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ], so (3,2) is free.\n\nMove R to (3,2), not food, so new head (3,2), body to (2,2), tail to (2,3)? New positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nThen I can move up to (3,3) but (3,3) is not occupied? In positions, tail is at (2,3), (3,3) is free.\n\nMove U to (3,3), then to (3,4) blocked, etc.\n\nBut it's messy, and I'm not closer to the food at (2,5).\n\nPerhaps a better initial move is to go towards the area where I can access the upper food.\n\nNotice that there is food at (2,6), and (2,5), but (2,4) blocked, so I need to enter from the side.\n\nFor example, from the right or left.\n\nBut left has obstacles, like (1,3), (1,4), etc.\n\nLet's list free cells around.\n\nPerhaps I should move up at some point, but at turn 2, I cannot move up because direction down, opposite not allowed.\n\nSo I must move D, L, or R.\n\nL and D seem risky, R might be better to go to the right side.\n\nMove R to (3,2) at turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,2) direction right, I can move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,3)\n\nPositions: head (3,3), tail (3,2)  (since no eat, tail moved from (2,2) to (3,2)? After turn 2: positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nMove U to (3,3), not food, so new head (3,3), body to (3,2), tail to (2,2)? New positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nAt (3,3), direction up.\n\nMoves: U to (3,4) obstacle invalid, L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D opposite invalid.\n\nSo move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3).\n\nSay move L to (2,3)\n\nAt (2,3), direction left.\n\nThen as before, only move D to (2,2), but (2,2) is tail position.\n\nMove to (2,2), new head (2,2), body to (2,3), tail to (3,3)? Previous positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), tail (2,2)? Let's not.\n\nFrom (3,3), instead of left, move R to (4,3)\n\nThen to (4,3), direction right.\n\nThen I can move U to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut this is taking time, and the food at (1,2) might be wasted, but it's not critical.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can eat the food at (1,2) but then immediately go down and right to avoid being trapped.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, move L to (1,2), eat food, positions [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ], direction left.\n\nTurn 3: only move D to (1,1), no food, positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (2,2)  [ (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ]\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 4: from (1,1) direction down, move R to (2,1), not food, positions: head (2,1), body (1,1), tail (1,2)  [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) ]\n\nDirection right.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,1) direction right, can move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1) or D to (2,0) invalid.\n\n(2,2) is free, no food.\n\nMove U to (2,2), not food, positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (1,1)  [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ]\n\nDirection up.\n\nThen at (2,2), direction up, can move U to (2,3), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is tail position? Positions have (1,1), so (1,2) free.\n\nMove U to (2,3), for example.\n\nThen to (2,3), direction up, and so on.\n\nBut still, to reach (2,5), I need to go up, but (2,4) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move L to (1,3) but (1,3) obstacle, or R to (3,3), etc.\n\nMove R to (3,3), then to (3,4) blocked, so move U from (3,3) but cannot, etc.\n\nIt seems difficult to reach the upper food from here.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (1,2) at all and go directly towards (2,5) from the start.\n\nBut at turn 2, with direction down, I can move R to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then since (3,4) blocked, move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3).\n\nIf move R to (4,3), then from (4,3) can move U to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at x=2, I am at x=4.\n\nI can go to (4,4), then to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5) or something.\n\nLet's see obstacles: (5,5) and (5,6) obstacles, so (4,5) might be free.\n\nFrom (4,3) move U to (4,4), not obstacle.\n\nThen to (4,4), direction up.\n\nMove U to (4,5), not obstacle.\n\nAt (4,5), direction up.\n\nThen can move L to (3,5), U to (4,6), R to (5,5) but (5,5) obstacle invalid, D opposite invalid.\n\nSo move L to (3,5) or U to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) free, (3,5) free.\n\nSay move L to (3,5).\n\nThen at (3,5), direction left.\n\nThen can move L to (2,5), which has food.\n\n(2,5) has food, so move to (2,5), eat it.\n\nBut let's count turns.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4) but (3,4) obstacle, invalid. From (3,3) after U from (3,2), direction up, at (3,3), cannot move U to (3,4) because obstacle, so must move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3).\n\nIf move R to (4,3), direction right.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,3)\n\nPositions: after turn 3, head at (3,3), tail at (3,2) for two segments? After turn 2: [ (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nTurn 3 move U to (3,3): new head (3,3), body (3,2), tail (2,2)? New positions: [ (3,3), (3,2) ] but tail should be (3,2), and (2,2) is gone? When head moves to (3,3), body moves to (3,2), and since no other, tail at (3,2), but (2,2) is vacated.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), tail (3,2)\n\nThen move R to (4,3): new head (4,3), body to (3,3), tail to (3,2)? New positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), tail (3,2)\n\nDirection right.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,4), not food, positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), tail (3,3)  [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nDirection up.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (4,5), not food, positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), tail (4,3)  [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nDirection up.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) direction up, move L to (3,5), not food, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,4)  [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) ]\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (2,5), which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head at (2,5), body segments stay, so positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) -- length 4.\n\nBut tail is at (4,4), and we have food at (2,6) above.\n\nFrom (2,5), direction left, can move U to (2,6) to eat that food, or L to (1,5), etc.\n\n(2,6) has food, so move U to (2,6), eat it, grow to length 5.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut at turn 2, I didn't eat the (1,2) food, so I missed it, but I ate two other foods.\n\nLife span of (1,2) is 8, so at turn 2 to 9, turn 8 is before turn 9, so at turn 8, (1,2) is still there, but I am at (2,5), far away.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life span 8, turn 2 to 9, turn 8 is within, eaten.\n\n(2,6) life span 9, turn 2 to 10, turn 8 or 9 eaten.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (2,5) at turn 8 and (2,6) at turn 9.\n\nBut I missed (1,2), which is fine, since I got two.\n\nAt turn 2, if I move down or left, I might eat (1,2) but then not reach the others easily.\n\nSo moving right at turn 2 seems better for long-term.\n\nBut let's confirm if from (3,2) I can go to (4,3) directly or something.\n\nFrom (3,2) direction right, I can move to (4,2) instead of up.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,2), not food, positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), tail (2,2) or whatever.\n\nThen from (4,2) move U to (4,3), etc., similar.\n\nBut moving up earlier might be faster.\n\nIn the path above, I reached (2,5) at turn 8.\n\nBut snake is short, only length 2 at start, after eating two foods, length 4 or 5.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no.\n\nFor turn 2, moving right seems good.\n\nBut what about moving down at turn 2?\n\nIf move D to (2,1), then I am at bottom, and to go up, I need to move left or right.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,1), then U to (3,2), then same as before, but I am at y=1, so it takes more turns to go up to y=5.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) move R to (3,1), then to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., but (3,4) blocked, so I need to go to (4,3) or something, similar to before but starting from lower y.\n\nIt might take more turns.\n\nMove L to (1,1), then stuck.\n\nSo moving down might be worse.\n\nTherefore, best to move right at turn 2 to (3,2).\n\nThen for subsequent moves, I can plan to go up and right to reach (4,5) area and then to (2,5).\n\nBut in the path, I need to specify actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for at least 5 turns? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd t1=2.\n\nSo I need to output for turn 2,3,4,5,6,... but how many? Probably until I eat or something, but at least for 5 turns to show the plan.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, I should have a plan to eat the food.\n\nIn the right move path, I can eat (2,5) around turn 8, but for the first few turns, I need actions.\n\nPerhaps I can include eating (1,2) if I can do it safely and escape.\n\nBut earlier it seemed difficult.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 2, move right to (3,2), then turn 3 move up to (3,3), turn 4 move right to (4,3), turn 5 move up to (4,4), turn 6 move up to (4,5), turn 7 move left to (3,5), turn 8 move left to (2,5) eat, etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 6 or 7.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is there, I can go directly.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach faster.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 2, I cannot go up directly.\n\nPerhaps later.\n\nBut for now, let's decide turn 2 action.\n\nI think moving right is best.\n\nThen for turn 3, from (3,2) direction right, I can move up to (3,3) to start going up.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,3) direction up, but cannot move up to (3,4), so move right to (4,3) or left to (2,3).\n\nMoving left to (2,3) might not help, better move right to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 5 from (4,3) move up to (4,4), and so on.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2) that I can ignore or eat later, but it might be possible to eat it after going up, but with obstacles, it might be hard to go back.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), I can go to (1,5), then down, but (1,4) obstacle, so (1,5) to (1,4) blocked, so I can only go to (1,6) but (1,6) obstacle, or to (2,6), etc.\n\n(1,5) to (1,4) not possible, to (1,6) not possible, so only to (2,5) or (0,5) wall, so (1,5) is a dead end if I go there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) might be difficult to reach after.\n\nSo probably, eating (1,2) early or never.\n\nBut since it's positive food, I should eat if possible without risk.\n\nIn the move left case, I can eat it but then go down and right, and from there I might go to (3,2) etc., but still far from (2,5).\n\nFor example, after being at (2,2) with length 3, I can move right to (3,2), then up, but same as before.\n\nBut I have the food point.\n\nLet's calculate the turns to reach (2,5) from different starting points.\n\nFrom (2,2) after eating (1,2): at turn 3, at (1,1), turn 4 at (2,1), turn 5 at (2,2) or (3,1), etc., at turn 5 at (2,2), then to (2,3) turn 6, then to (3,3) turn 7, then to (3,4) blocked, so to (4,3) turn 8, then to (4,4) turn 9, to (4,5) turn 10, to (3,5) turn 11, to (2,5) turn 12. Too late, food at (2,5) life span to turn 9, so gone by turn 10.\n\nLife span 8 from turn 2, available until turn 9, so turn 12 is too late.\n\nSimilarly, from not eating (1,2), move right at turn 2 to (3,2), turn 3 to (3,3), turn 4 to (4,3), turn 5 to (4,4), turn 6 to (4,5), turn 7 to (3,5), turn 8 to (2,5), which is turn 8, within turn 9, so I can eat.\n\nAnd (2,6) at turn 9.\n\nSo better not to eat (1,2).\n\nIf I eat (1,2), I might not reach (2,5) in time.\n\nTherefore, for turn 2, move right to (3,2).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan the path to (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,2) direction right, move U to (3,3) on turn 3.\n\nThen from (3,3) direction up, cannot U, so move R to (4,3) on turn 4.\n\nThen from (4,3) direction right, move U to (4,4) on turn 5.\n\nFrom (4,4) direction up, move U to (4,5) on turn 6.\n\nFrom (4,5) direction up, move L to (3,5) on turn 7.\n\nFrom (3,5) direction left, move L to (2,5) on turn 8, eat food.\n\nThen from (2,5) direction left, move U to (2,6) on turn 9, eat another food.\n\nAnd (1,2) is not eaten, but it's fine.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list actions for turn 2 to, say, turn 7 or 8.\n\nBut the format is to list actions starting from current turn.\n\nSince I need to output for multiple turns, I can do up to turn 6 or 7.\n\nBut to be safe, let's include until I eat or something.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output at least 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2.\n\nSo actions for turn 2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nIn the path:\n\nTurn 2: R (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 3: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 4: R (to (4,3))  // since from (3,3) direction up, move R to (4,3)\n\nAt (3,3) direction up, moves possible: L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D invalid.\n\nI chose R to (4,3).\n\nTurn 5: U (to (4,4))  // from (4,3) direction right, move U to (4,4)\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), direction is right (since moved right from up? From (3,3) to (4,3) is right, and previous direction up, so new direction right.\n\nThen move U to (4,4), which is up, not opposite, so direction now up.\n\nTurn 6: U (to (4,5))  // from (4,4) direction up, move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: L (to (3,5))  // from (4,5) direction up, move L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 8: L to (2,5) eat, but beyond 5 turns from turn 2.\n\nFor 5 turns: turn 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nUp to turn 6, I am at (4,5), safe, and heading to (3,5) next.\n\nAlso, no immediate risks.\n\nIf I move L at turn 4 to (2,3), it might not be better.\n\nSo this seems a plan.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nBut turn 6 U to (4,5), then for turn 7, I would move L to (3,5), but since not required, I can stop.\n\nTo show more, but I think for the answer, list from turn 2 to, say, turn 6 or 7.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list as many as I want, but probably 5 or 6 actions.\n\nSince the snake is short, and grid has obstacles, this path avoids risks and reaches food.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing paths that avoid dead ends and lead to the high-value food at (2,5) and (2,6) while considering the constraints of the grid and obstacles. The food at (1,2) is avoided initially because moving to eat it traps the snake in the bottom-left corner with limited escape routes, risking an inability to reach other food and potential collisions. The grid has internal obstacles that block direct vertical paths, so a route via the right side (e.g., moving to (3,2) first) is safer and more efficient for accessing (2,5) and (2,6).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 2)**:\n  - Snake head at (2,2), direction down (D), so possible moves: down (D), left (L), right (R). Up is invalid (instant reverse).\n  - Food: (1,2) (value +1, life span 8, available turns 2–9), (2,5) (value +1, life span 8, available turns 2–9), (2,6) (value +1, life span 9, available turns 2–10).\n  - Obstacles: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6). Critical block at (2,4) prevents direct access to (2,5) from below.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Moving left (L) to (1,2) eats food but forces the snake into a dead end (only down to (1,1) is possible), wasting turns and making it hard to reach (2,5) before it expires (turn 9).\n  - Moving down (D) to (2,1) also risks bottom-corner trapping and delays reaching upper food.\n  - Moving right (R) to (3,2) opens a path to navigate around obstacles toward (2,5) efficiently.\n- **Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns)**:\n  - **Turn 2**: Move right (R) to (3,2) to avoid (1,2) trap and start pathing toward open areas.\n  - **Turn 3**: From (3,2), direction right, move up (U) to (3,3) to ascend toward y=5/6.\n  - **Turn 4**: From (3,3), direction up, but cannot move up (U to (3,4) blocked by obstacle). Move right (R) to (4,3) to bypass obstacle.\n  - **Turn 5**: From (4,3), direction right, move up (U) to (4,4) continuing ascent.\n  - **Turn 6**: From (4,4), direction up, move up (U) to (4,5) to approach (2,5) from the right.\n  - **Beyond**: By turn 7, move left (L) to (3,5), then turn 8 left (L) to (2,5) to eat food. Turn 9, move up (U) to (2,6) to eat next food. This path eats both (2,5) and (2,6) within their life spans (turn 8 and 9), with minimal risk.\n\nThis plan safely navigates obstacles, avoids dead ends, and achieves a score increase of +2 by eating (2,5) and (2,6), compared to +1 from (1,2) with high risk. The snake survives long-term with room to explore after turn 6.\n\n### Actions for Turns 2 to 7 (5+ turns planned):\n- Turn 2: Move right (R) to (3,2) — avoids (1,2) trap and heads to open space.\n- Turn 3: Move up (U) to (3,3) — ascends while avoiding obstacle at (3,4).\n- Turn 4: Move right (R) to (4,3) — navigates around obstacle, setting up vertical path.\n- Turn 5: Move up (U) to (4,4) — continues ascent toward food area.\n- Turn 6: Move up (U) to (4,5) — positions to access (2,5) from east.\n- Turn 7: Move left (L) to (3,5) — directly toward (2,5) for eating on turn 8.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: R (right)\nTurn 3: U (up)\nTurn 4: R (right)\nTurn 5: U (up)\nTurn 6: U (up)\nTurn 7: L (left)\n}",
