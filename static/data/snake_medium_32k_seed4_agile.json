Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n  \n- **Snake Position and Direction**: \n  - Head at (1,5), direction is Up (U).\n  - Body segments: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)] (head first, tail last).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,2): value +1, lifespan 6 (can be eaten until Turn 19).\n  - (6,6): value +1, lifespan 9 (can be eaten until Turn 22).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 14\n\nFrom the head position (1,5) with current direction U, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (1,6)**:\n   - (1,6) is within bounds and not obstructed by walls or obstacles.\n   - Snake body: (1,6) is not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (1,4)**:\n   - (1,4) is the second segment of the snake's body.\n   - Collision rules: Moving into a body segment that is not the tail causes a collision.\n   - Invalid move (would collide with body).\n\n3. **Left (L) to (0,5)**:\n   - x=0 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid move (wall collision).\n\n4. **Right (R) to (2,5)**:\n   - (2,5) is within bounds and not obstructed.\n   - Snake body: (2,5) is not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n**Valid Moves**: U or R.\n\n### Evaluating Move U to (1,6)\n\nIf we choose U:\n\n- New head position: (1,6), direction U.\n- Snake body updates: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)], tail at (3,4) (since (3,5) is removed).\n  \nAt Turn 15 from (1,6), direction U:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (1,7) is y=7 (wall) → invalid.\n  - D: (1,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (0,6) is x=0 (wall) → invalid.\n  - R: (2,6) is free → valid.\n\nOnly move is R to (2,6).\n\nAt Turn 16 from (2,6), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (2,7) is y=7 (wall) → invalid.\n  - D: (2,5) is free → valid.\n  - L: (1,6) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (3,6) is obstacle → invalid.\n\nOnly move is D to (2,5).\n\nContinuing this path leads the snake towards the top-right but may not reach any food before they expire. Specifically, reaching (4,2) by Turn 19 seems unlikely from this path.\n\n### Evaluating Move R to (2,5)\n\nIf we choose R:\n\n- New head position: (2,5), direction R.\n- Snake body updates: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)], tail at (3,4).\n\nAt Turn 15 from (2,5), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (2,6) is free → valid.\n  - D: (2,4) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (1,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (3,5) is free → valid.\n\nChoose R to (3,5) to head towards the center.\n\nAt Turn 16 from (3,5), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (3,6) is obstacle → invalid.\n  - D: (3,4) is free → valid.\n  - L: (2,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (4,5) is free → valid.\n\nChoose D to (3,4) to start descending towards (4,2).\n\nAt Turn 17 from (3,4), direction D:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (3,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (2,4) is free → valid.\n  - R: (4,4) is free → valid.\n  - D: Not applicable (no reverse).\n\nChoose R to (4,4) to continue towards (4,2).\n\nAt Turn 18 from (4,4), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (4,5) is free → valid.\n  - D: (4,3) is free → valid.\n  - L: (3,4) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (5,4) is free → valid.\n\nChoose D to (4,3) to approach (4,2).\n\nAt Turn 19 from (4,3), direction D:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (4,4) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (3,3) is free → valid.\n  - R: (5,3) is free → valid.\n  - D: (4,2) is food → valid and can be eaten (lifespan 1 at Turn 19).\n\nChoose D to (4,2) to eat the food, increasing score by +1 and snake length by 1.\n\n### Comparing Both Paths\n\n- **U Path**: Leads snake towards top, may not reach food in time, higher risk of getting stuck.\n- **R Path**: Efficiently moves towards (4,2), ensuring the food is eaten before it expires, with a clear and safe path.\n\n### Avoiding Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (3,4) when moving towards (4,2), which is not adjacent to the head at any point where food is eaten, so no danger.\n- **Collisions**: All moves avoid body segments except the tail when safe.\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: All moves are checked against walls and internal obstacles.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe optimal immediate action at Turn 14 is to move **Right (R)** to (2,5), initiating a path that safely leads to eating the positive food at (4,2) by Turn 19, maximizing the score while ensuring the snake's survival.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nTo clearly outline the planned moves:\n\n1. **Turn 14**: R to (2,5)\n2. **Turn 15**: R to (3,5)\n3. **Turn 16**: D to (3,4)\n4. **Turn 17**: R to (4,4)\n5. **Turn 18**: D to (4,3)\n6. **Turn 19**: D to (4,2) (eat food)\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the immediate action at Turn 14, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

There are also internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n\n2. **Snake**: The snake's positions are given as [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)], with the head at (4,4) and the tail at (1,4). The head's current direction is \"D\" (down).\n\n3. **Food**: There are two pieces of food:\n   - (4,2) with value +1 and life span 2 (disappears after turn 20).\n   - (6,6) with value +1 and life span 5 (disappears after turn 23).\n\n### Goal\n\nMaximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the opposite move (Up, U) is not allowed in the next turn.\n\n**Current Position**: Head at (4,4), direction D.\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n1. **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n   - Check if (4,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Part of the snake's body (second segment).\n   - Conclusion: Invalid (collision with body).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Food Options\n\nThere are two pieces of food:\n1. **(4,2)**: Life span 2 means it disappears after turn 20. It's two moves away (D to (4,3), then D to (4,2)).\n   - Can be eaten on turn 19.\n\n2. **(6,6)**: Life span 5 means it disappears after turn 23. It's four moves away (R to (5,4), R to (6,4), U to (6,5), U to (6,6)).\n   - Can be eaten on turn 21.\n\n### Step 3: Planning the Path to (4,2)\n\n**Turn 18**: Move D to (4,3).\n**Turn 19**: Move D to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\n**After Eating**:\n- The snake's length increases by 1.\n- New head at (4,2), body extends to include the previous tail.\n\n**Subsequent Moves**:\n- **Turn 20**: From (4,2), possible moves:\n  - D to (4,1): Valid but risky as it's near the bottom wall.\n  - L to (3,2): Valid.\n  - R to (5,2): Valid.\n- **Turn 21**: From (3,2) or (5,2), continue moving to open space.\n\n### Step 4: Planning the Path to (6,6)\n\n**Turn 18**: Move R to (5,4).\n**Turn 19**: Move R to (6,4).\n**Turn 20**: Move U to (6,5).\n**Turn 21**: Move U to (6,6) to eat the food.\n\n**After Eating**:\n- The snake's length increases by 1.\n- New head at (6,6), body extends.\n\n**Problem**:\n- From (6,6), the snake is trapped:\n  - U to (6,7): Wall.\n  - D to (6,5): Body segment.\n  - L to (5,6): Obstacle.\n  - R to (7,6): Wall.\n- No valid moves left → death.\n\n### Step 5: Comparing Both Options\n\n1. **Option 1: Eat (4,2)**\n   - Pros: +1 score, safe path.\n   - Cons: (6,6) is left uneaten, but it's a trap anyway.\n\n2. **Option 2: Eat (6,6)**\n   - Pros: +1 score.\n   - Cons: Leads to immediate death.\n\n**Conclusion**: Option 1 is better because it's safe and ensures survival.\n\n### Step 6: Finalizing the Action Sequence\n\nBased on the analysis, the best immediate action is to move Down (D) towards (4,2).\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n1. **Turn 18**: D → (4,3).\n2. **Turn 19**: D → (4,2) → eat food.\n3. **Turn 20**: L → (3,2).\n4. **Turn 21**: U → (3,3).\n5. **Turn 22**: U → (3,4).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats the food and then moves towards open space to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Turn 18**: Move D to (4,3). Valid.\n- **Turn 19**: Move D to (4,2). Valid and eat food.\n- **Turn 20**: Move L to (3,2). Valid.\n- **Turn 21**: Move U to (3,3). Valid.\n- **Turn 22**: Move U to (3,4). Valid.\n\nAll moves are safe and avoid collisions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the immediate action for Turn 18 is to move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Alternatives:\n   - U to (5,4): Less direct path to food, same eventual outcome but slower.\n   - D to (5,2): Moves away from food, risking missing (6,6) before it expires.\n\nThus, **R is the optimal immediate action** to maximize score and survival.",

Possible moves: D, L, or R (cannot reverse to U).\n2. **Food Priorities**: \n   - (3,2) has a lifespan of 4 (will disappear after turn 58), so it must be eaten soon. \n   - (1,2) is unreachable before it disappears.\n   - (5,4) and (3,1) have longer lifespans and can be targeted later.\n3. **Move Selection**:\n   - **D (to (4,2))**: Best choice to set up eating (3,2) next turn. Safe (no collisions) and leaves (3,3) free for future flexibility.\n   - L (to (3,3)): Also viable but less optimal for long-term space.\n   - R (to (5,3)): Takes the snake away from high-priority food.\n4. **Sequence**: After moving D at \\( t_0 = 55 \\), the next steps will be:\n   - Turn 56: L to (3,2) to eat the food.\n   - Turn 57: D to (3,1) to eat another food.\n   - Subsequent moves right to avoid trapping.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

Not the tail (tail is at (6,1)), so moving here would cause a collision.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (2,6)\n   - Check (2,6):\n     - Not a wall (y=6 is not a border).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)).\n     - Not occupied by the snake (snake positions don't include (2,6)).\n   - **Valid**.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (2,4)\n   - Check (2,4): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at position 4). Not the tail.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n4. **Left (L)**: (1,5)\n   - Check (1,5): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at position 2). Also, moving left is the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 93**: The only possible move is **Up (U)** to (2,6).\n\n### Simulating Turn 93: Move U to (2,6)\n\nAfter moving U to (2,6):\n\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - Head: (2,6)\n  - Body: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2)]\n  - Tail: (6,1) is removed (since no food was eaten, length remains the same).\n- **New Head Direction**: U (since we moved up).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 94\n\nFrom the new head position (2,6) with current direction U, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2,7)\n   - Check (2,7): y=7 is a wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (2,5)\n   - Check (2,5): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at position 2). Not the tail.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,6)\n   - Check (1,6):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake.\n     - Has food (value=1, life_span=2 at turn 93, so at turn 94, life_span=1, still present).\n   - **Valid**.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (3,6)\n   - Check (3,6): Internal obstacle.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 94**: The only possible move is **Left (L)** to (1,6), which will eat the positive food there.\n\n### Simulating Turn 94: Move L to (1,6) and Eat Food\n\nAfter moving L to (1,6) and eating the food:\n\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - Head: (1,6)\n  - Body: [(2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2)]\n  - Length increases by 1 (no tail is removed).\n- **New Head Direction**: L (since we moved left).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 95\n\nFrom the new head position (1,6) with current direction L, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (1,7)\n   - Check (1,7): y=7 is a wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (1,5)\n   - Check (1,5): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at position 4). Not the tail.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (0,6)\n   - Check (0,6): x=0 is a wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (2,6)\n   - Check (2,6): Occupied by the snake's body (segment at position 2). Not the tail.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 95**: No possible moves; the snake is trapped and will die.\n\n### Verifying Alternative Paths\n\nIs there any alternative sequence that avoids this dead end?\n\n- **At Turn 93**: Only possible move is U to (2,6). No other moves are valid.\n- **At Turn 94**: Only possible move is L to (1,6). No other moves are valid.\n  \nThus, the sequence leading to the snake's death is unavoidable given the current state.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nGiven the analysis, the only possible actions are:\n\n- **Turn 93**: Move U to (2,6).\n- **Turn 94**: Move L to (1,6).\n\nAfter these moves, the snake has no valid moves left and will die on Turn 95.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U} (for Turn 93)",
