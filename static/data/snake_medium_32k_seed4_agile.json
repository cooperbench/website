That means the tail is also at (3,4).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has positive value +1, since value is 1, and it says \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive food. Negative food would have -1, but here all are +1, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3) it's 10, others 9, meaning they disappear after that many turns, including the current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Since the snake is at (3,4) and direction is Up, moving Up would go to (3,5). But I need to think about possible moves and plan ahead.\n> \n> Available moves: U, D, L, R. But since head direction is U, moving Down would be opposite, which might be restricted? The rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since the snake is moving now, and current direction is U, I cannot move D on this turn, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Let me confirm: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" But for turn t1, I'm choosing the action for turn t1. Since the snake was moving Up to reach (3,4), I assume, but the position is given as (3,4), and direction U, so for the next move, I need to choose a direction.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Head Direction: U\" and positions: [(3,4)]. Since it's a single point, the direction might indicate the last move direction or the facing direction. But since there's only one segment, moving opposite might be possible? The rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn t1, current direction is U, so I cannot choose D as the action for turn t1.\n> \n> Similarly, I can choose U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> Now, the grid: let's sketch a mental map.\n> \n> Grid from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7. Borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake at (3,4)\n> \n> Food at: (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (4,3)\n> \n> (4,3) is directly below (3,4), since (3,4) to (4,3) is down-right? Let's see coordinates: x increases right, y increases up? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but since U is (x,y+1), it implies y increases as we go up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> In the movement definition: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases upward.\n> \n> So for point (3,4), moving U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n> \n> But walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls, so at (3,4), all adjacent cells are within bounds except possibly y=0 or y=7, but y=4 is fine.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, but (3,4) is y=4, so adjacent cells: (3,5) is y=5, (3,3) is y=3, both within 1 to 6? x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6, y:1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are free, except obstacles. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 free.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, y=7 wall, so y from 1 to 6? y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7; but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so playable area y=1 to y=6? But food at (1,6), y=6, which should be within bounds if y=1 to 6, since y=6 <7.\n> \n> y=1 to y=6 inclusive, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> Now obstacles: (3,6) — (3,6) is at y=6, which is top row.\n> \n> (2,1) y=1 bottom\n> \n> (1,3) x=1,y=3\n> \n> (2,3) x=2,y=3\n> \n> (5,6) x=5,y=6\n> \n> Food: (5,5) x=5,y=5\n> \n> (1,6) x=1,y=6\n> \n> (5,1) x=5,y=1\n> \n> (4,3) x=4,y=3\n> \n> Snake at (3,4)\n> \n> Now, for turn 1, I need to choose action: U, L, R, but not D because current direction U, so no instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,5)\n> \n> - L to (2,4)\n> \n> - R to (4,4)\n> \n> D to (3,3) is invalid because opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will grow if it eats food, but since length is 1, if it eats food, it will become length 2, with head and tail at the new position? When snake eats food, it grows on the next turn, I think. But let's see the rules.\n> \n> The rules say: when eating positive food, length increases by 1. But how does the growth happen? Typically in snake, when you eat food, you grow by not moving the tail for that turn, so the new segment is added where the tail was or something. But here, since it's moving, I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food. But for movement, after moving to a cell with food, if eaten, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> But in this case, since the snake is length 1, if it eats food, after moving to food cell, the snake should become length 2, with head at food position, and tail at previous position? Let's think.\n> \n> Start: snake at (3,4), length 1.\n> \n> If I move to a cell with food, say (4,3) has food, which is down-right? (4,3) is to the right and down? From (3,4) to (4,3): x+1, y-1, which is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). (4,3) is not adjacent to (3,4); it's diagonal? No, adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So from (3,4), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (3,5)\n> \n> - D: (3,3) but cannot move D\n> \n> - L: (2,4)\n> \n> - R: (4,4)\n> \n> (4,3) is not adjacent; it's at (4,3), which is one right, one down, so not directly reachable in one move.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) is not adjacent to snake head.\n> \n> Let's list all adjacent cells from (3,4):\n> \n> - (3,5): up\n> \n> - (3,3): down (invalid move)\n> \n> - (2,4): left\n> \n> - (4,4): right\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are free.\n> \n> First, walls: (3,5) is within bounds, x=3, y=5, not border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) is not listed as obstacle, so should be free? Obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So (3,5) not obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) not obstacle, (4,4) not obstacle.\n> \n> (3,3) not obstacle, but cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, food: is there food at any adjacent cell? Food at (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (4,3). None of these are at (3,5), (2,4), or (4,4). (4,3) is food, but not adjacent.\n> \n> So no food adjacent to snake head at (3,4).\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 1, whichever move I make, I won't eat food, so snake remains length 1, and the position after move will be the new head position, and since no growth, the tail moves away, but since length 1, moving to a new cell means the snake is now at that cell alone.\n> \n> After moving to, say, (3,5), the snake will be at [(3,5)], and direction updated.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list all food and their positions and life span.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5): value +1, life span 9, so disappears after turn 9, meaning on turn 10 it's gone? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 1, life span 9, so it will disappear after 9 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life_span L at turn t, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> Since countdown decreases every turn, at turn t, countdown is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then disappears.\n> \n> So for food at turn 1:\n> \n> - (5,5): life_span 9, so countdown 9, disappears after turn 9 (since after 9 turns, at turn 10 it's gone? Let's index turns.\n> \n> Turn 1: countdown 9\n> \n> After turn 1, countdown 8 at start of turn 2? The state is given at turn 1, so for food, life_span is given, meaning at this turn, it has that many turns left.\n> \n> At turn 1, (5,5) has life_span 9, so it will be present for 9 more turns, disappearing after turn 9, so last chance to eat is turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): life_span 9, same.\n> \n> (5,1): life_span 9\n> \n> (4,3): life_span 10, so disappears after turn 10.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (3,4), length 1.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> Since I must provide an action sequence, and think 5+ turns ahead, I should choose a path that allows me to eat food while avoiding dangers.\n> \n> First, let's consider the available moves for turn 1:\n> \n> - U to (3,5)\n> \n> - L to (2,4)\n> \n> - R to (4,4)\n> \n> From each, I can go further.\n> \n> Also, note that (4,3) has food, which is below and right of (3,4), but not adjacent. To reach it, I need to move to (4,4) or (3,3) first, but (3,3) is down, which I can't move directly, but after moving, direction changes.\n> \n> For example, if I move R to (4,4), then from there, I can move to (4,3) if possible.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> But (4,3) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> (5,5) has life span 9, etc.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, snake is length 1, so tail is same as head, but after moving, if I eat food, tail might be different.\n> \n> Currently, since length 1, the tail is at (3,4), and if I move away, the tail moves, so (3,4) becomes empty.\n> \n> But if there is food under the tail, it can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> But here, no food under snake now, since snake is at (3,4) and no food there.\n> \n> Food is at other positions.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid with obstacles to find paths.\n> \n> List all wall cells: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. But since it's the border, we don't consider those cells as movable.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So free cells are all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except the obstacle cells.\n> \n> Obstacle cells: (1,3), (2,3), (2,1), (3,6), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) are both obstacles, so row y=3, x=1 and x=2 blocked.\n> \n> Also (2,1) at bottom, (3,6) and (5,6) at top row y=6.\n> \n> y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, but (3,6) and (5,6) are obstacles, so not free.\n> \n> Similarly, x=6, y=6 is free if not obstacle.\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (1,1) to (6,6) except obstacles.\n> \n> Food at (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (4,3)\n> \n> (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is top-left corner, but (1,6) is not obstacle, so free, and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) bottom-right, (5,5) middle-right, (4,3) middle-down.\n> \n> Snake at (3,4) center.\n> \n> Now, to eat food, I need to move towards them.\n> \n> But I need to think about the tail reward danger later.\n> \n> First, let's consider the moves.\n> \n> For turn 1, I can go U, L, or R.\n> \n> If I go U to (3,5): from (3,5), I can go U, D, L, R, but U to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, so cannot go U. D to (3,4), but if I just came from U, direction would be U, so moving D might be reverse? Let's see.\n> \n> After moving to (3,5), the head direction is U (since I moved U), so for next turn, I cannot move D.\n> \n> From (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, so invalid. D to (3,4), but if direction U, moving D is opposite, so cannot.

It's turn 2, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I should confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let's see: borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would be a wall collision. Similarly, internal obstacles are given: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: only [(4,4)], which means the snake has only one segment, the head. So the snake is just the head at (4,4). That means there's no body yet, so no collision risk with body except for the tail reward danger, but since there's no tail, that might not apply yet.\n> \n> Snake head direction is R, which is right, so currently moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 2, it has 8 turns left? Life span is given as 8, and it decreases each turn, so after this turn, it will have 7 left, and so on. But since we're at turn 2, and it has life span 8, that means it will disappear after turn 9 or something. Let's clarify.\n> \n> The food life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1 or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the turn when it spawns, countdown is N, and it decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So for example, if a food has life span 8 at turn 2, it means countdown is 8 at turn 2, then turn 3 it becomes 7, ..., turn 9 it becomes 1, turn 10 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9, inclusive, I think. But since it disappears after countdown 0, it's not there on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (5,5): value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (1,6): value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (5,1): value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All foods have value 1, so all positive food? The value is 1, which is positive, so no negative food here. Value 1 means +1, and length increases by 1.\n> \n> Also, special case: food can spawn under snake body, but here snake is only at (4,4), and foods are at (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (4,3). (4,3) is one cell below (4,4), since y increases up? Direction: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so (4,3) is below (4,4)? Let's set coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U (x,y+1) – if U is up, then y increases as we go up. So (4,4) to U would be (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n> \n> So (4,3) is directly below (4,4).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) is under the snake? Snake is at (4,4), which is head, but no body. (4,3) is not occupied by snake; snake is only at (4,4). Positions are [(4,4)], so only one cell. Therefore, (4,3) is empty, but there is food there.\n> \n> Food at (4,3): ( (4,3), value 1, life span 9 )\n> \n> Similarly, others: (5,5), (1,6), (5,1)\n> \n> All have life span 8 or 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, since snake has only head, if I eat food, I grow to length 2.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: but since no tail, it shouldn't be an issue yet.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Also borders.\n> \n> Current snake head: (4,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) next turn because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, let's see adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Right (R): (5,4)\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,3)\n> \n> - Left (L): not allowed\n> \n> Now, (4,3) has food with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> (5,4) is empty? Let's see if there's food or obstacle.\n> \n> Foods are at (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (4,3). So (5,4) has no food, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) has no food.\n> \n> (4,3) has food.\n> \n> But moving to (4,3) is down, which is possible.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,3), I eat the food there, since head moves onto it. Then snake grows to length 2, with head at (4,3) and tail at (4,4)?

If I moved D, new direction is D, so I cannot move U next (up, opposite).\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), direction is D.\n> \n> Then next turn, I can move L, R, or D, not U.\n> \n> Cells around (4,3):\n> \n> - D: (4,2) – but y=2, which is above y=1? y=1 is the bottom wall? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row, y=6 is the top? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall collision.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> So (4,3): y=3, so D to (4,2) is within bounds.\n> \n> (4,2) is empty, no food or obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6) – none at (4,2).\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,3), R to (5,3), U to (4,4) but U is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> From (4,3) with direction D, possible moves: L (left to (3,3)), R (right to (5,3)), D (down to (4,2))\n> \n> (4,4) is now the tail, but since tail will move when I move, it might be safe to go there later, but not now because it's occupied.\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), positions are [(4,3), (4,4)] – head at (4,3), tail at (4,4).\n> \n> If I move next to (4,4), which is U, but U is opposite to current direction D, so not allowed anyway. And even if it were, moving to tail cell might be safe only if the tail moves away, but in this case, since I just moved, the tail is still there, so moving to (4,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> General rule: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> But in this case, if I try to move to tail cell, and tail moves, it might be ok.\n> \n> For example, suppose snake is [head, tail], positions A then B.

It's turn 3. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7. But walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the cells are from (1,1) to (6,6) inclusive? Let's confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x-coordinates from 1 to 6 are playable? Similarly for y.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning those columns are blocked. Similarly y=0 and y=7. So the grid has cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? But let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) to (6,6) would be a 6x6 grid, but let's see the snake position: snake is at (4,3) and (4,4). (4,3) and (4,4) are within x=4, y=3 and 4, which should be fine if walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n> \n> Also, food at (5,5), (1,6), (5,1). (1,6): x=1, y=6. If y=6, and walls at y=7, so y=6 should be playable. Similarly, x=1 should be playable since x=0 is wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,4). So snake length is 2. Head direction is down, which is D. Moving down increases y? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And head direction is D, down, so decreasing y.\n> \n> Current head at (4,3), direction D, so it came from (4,4) since body is at (4,4). Positions are head first: [(4,3), (4,4)], so head at (4,3), tail at (4,4). Since direction is D, down, meaning it moved from (4,4) to (4,3) by decreasing y.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> All positive food, since value +1. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: each has life span 7, meaning they disappear after 7 turns from now? Or including current turn? It says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t, life span N, it will disappear at turn t + N. Countdown starts from N and decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown is N, turn t+1 is N-1, ..., turn t+N-1 is 1, turn t+N it disappears. Since it says \"after N turns\", so at turn t+N, it's gone.\n> \n> Current turn t=3, life span 7, so food will disappear at turn 3+7=10. Countdown: at turn 3, life span 7; turn 4, 6; ... turn 10, 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 3.\n> \n> Actions: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: (4,4) but that's where the tail is? (4,4) is current tail, but when I move, the tail will also move, so it might be ok.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision is deadly if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, wall collision.\n> \n> From (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,4) - but (4,4) is currently occupied by the tail. Since tail will move, if I move U to (4,4), and tail moves, it should be safe, as long as no other body part is there. Snake has only two segments, head and tail. So moving to tail position is ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> After move, snake positions: if I move U to (4,4), head was at (4,3), move U to (4,4), so new head at (4,4). Then the body: since snake grows only when eating food, not eating now, so tail moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves to the next segment or is removed? Positions: current positions [(4,3), (4,4)].\n> \n> If I move head to new position, and no food eaten, the tail is removed, so new positions: head at new cell, and the body from index 1 to end-1 stays, but since length 2, after moving head to new position, and no eat, the tail cell is vacated, so new positions: only [new_head], but no, for length 2, moving: head moves to new cell, say (x,y), and the body segment moves to where head was, so new positions: [ (new_head), (old_head) ].\n> \n> For example: current: head at A, tail at B. Move head to C, no eat, then new head at C, and tail moves to A, so positions [C, A].\n> \n> Similarly, if eat, tail stays, so positions [C, A, B] but B was tail, now body.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,3) head, (4,4) tail.\n> \n> If move U to (4,4): but (4,4) is current tail position. After move: head moves to (4,4), and since no eat (assuming no food there), tail moves to (4,3), so new positions: [(4,4), (4,3)].\n> \n> No collision because the cell (4,4) was occupied, but by tail, which moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to a cell with food, and eat, then tail doesn't move, so positions: head to food cell, and body stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: to (4,4) - possible, and since tail moves, no collision.\n> \n> - D: to (4,2) - direction down, y-1, so (4,2). Is this valid? Head direction is D, moving D is same direction, not reverse. Reverse would be U.\n> \n> - L: to (3,3) - left, x-1\n> \n> - R: to (5,3) - right, x+1\n> \n> Now, check walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so (4,2): y=2, which is not 0 or 7, so ok. Similarly, (3,3): x=3, not 0 or 7. (5,3) x=5, not 0 or 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). None of these are at (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3), so all moves are possible in terms of walls.\n> \n> But (1,3) and (2,3) are obstacles, but for (3,3) it's not listed, so (3,3) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (5,5), (1,6), (5,1). None at the adjacent cells directly, so no immediate food to eat.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Since all food is positive, I should eat them, but with the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,4), head at (4,3), so they are adjacent vertically. Head is below tail? (4,3) and (4,4), so head at y=3, tail at y=4, so tail is above head, since head direction down.\n> \n> Are they adjacent? Yes, sharing same x, y differs by 1.\n> \n> If the tail cell (4,4) had food, and I eat it, it would be dangerous. But (4,4) has no food; food is elsewhere.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

Food at (5,5), not (5,4). (5,4) not listed, so no food.\n> \n> - D to (5,2): no food, (5,1) is food, but (5,2) is different.\n> \n> - R to (6,3): no food, (6,4) is food, but (6,3) is adjacent.\n> \n> (6,4) is food, but (6,3) is empty.\n> \n> Also, (4,3) is current tail, but if I move L to (4,3), that would be instant reverse?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L, it appears at turn T, it will disappear at turn T + L - 1? Example: if spawned at turn 1, life span 3, it disappears after 3 turns, so on turn 4 it's gone. Countdown: turn 1: countdown 3, turn 2: countdown 2, turn 3: countdown 1, turn 4: gone. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0, up to the turn when countdown decreases to 0, but after that turn it's gone.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" at current turn, so for (5,5,6,1), life span 6, so at turn 4, countdown is 6, meaning it can be eaten until turn 4+6-1=9? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is L, countdown starts at L and decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, countdown = L, at turn t+1, countdown = L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, countdown =1, and after that, it disappears, so not present on turn t + L.\n> \n> For (5,5,6,1) at turn 4: countdown=6, so it can be eaten on turns 4,5,6,7,8,9 (countdown 6 to 1), disappears on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6,6,1): same, disappears turn 10.\n> \n> (5,1,6,1): same.\n> \n> (6,4,10,1): life span 10, so countdown=10 at turn 4, disappears turn 14.\n> \n> All good for now.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.

Usually y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but I'll assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top for simplicity, since no specification.\n> \n> In the state, it says \"Cells occupied by walls: - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So y=0 and y=7 are walls, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (5,3), which is middle-right, x=5,y=3.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) - up, (1,6) - left-top, (5,1) - down, (6,4) - right-up.\n> \n> (6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (3,6): x=3,y=6\n> \n> (2,1): x=2,y=1\n> \n> (1,3): x=1,y=3\n> \n> (2,3): x=2,y=3\n> \n> (5,6): x=5,y=6\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> I should consider going for the closest food, but (6,4) is very close; I can reach it in two moves: to (6,3) then to (6,4), but need to check if that's safe.\n> \n> First, move to (6,3) at turn 4: from (5,3) to (6,3), direction now R.\n> \n> Then at turn 5, from (6,3), I can go to (6,4) to eat the food, since (6,4) has food.\n> \n> But is that safe?

Because on turn 5, countdown=5, turn 6 countdown=4, ..., turn 9 countdown=1, then after turn 9, it disappears, so not on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,6): life span 5 at turn 5, same as above.\n> \n> (5,1): life span 5, same.\n> \n> (6,4): life span 9 at turn 5, so it will last until turn 5+9-1=13, disappear before turn 14.\n> \n> But I need to plan for the next 5+ turns, so up to turn 10 or so.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,4), direction U. So current direction is up.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but I cannot move opposite to current direction. Since current direction is U, opposite is D, so I cannot move down on this turn. But I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite on next turn. But this is the current turn, turn 5.\n> \n> For turn 5, I can choose U, L, or R. Down is not allowed because it's opposite to current U.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (5,5): directly above head at (5,4). If I move U, I go to (5,5), which has food. Since head moves onto it, and it's not under body, I can eat it immediately.\n> \n> But snake positions: head (5,4), body (5,3). Food at (5,5) is not under body, so moving U to (5,5) would eat the food.\n> \n> But there's a rule: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3). Head is at (5,4), so adjacent vertically? (5,4) and (5,3) are adjacent, yes.\n> \n> But the food is at (5,5), not at tail. Tail is at (5,3), which doesn't have food. So no issue.\n> \n> Tail Reward Danger only if the food is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> Here, tail is (5,3), no food there. Food is at (5,5), so eating it should be fine.\n> \n> But let me confirm the positions.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,4), body (5,3). So tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Food at (5,5): if I move U to (5,5), I eat the food, snake grows to length 3, new tail will be where? After moving, head to (5,5), body segments: the old head (5,4) becomes body, and old tail (5,3) remains or moves?\n> \n> When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n> \n> But if it eats, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at head position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - Move head to new cell.\n> \n> - If new cell has food, snake grows: body stays, new head position, so length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, snake moves: head to new, each body segment to previous position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> So here, if I move to (5,5) which has food, I eat it, so new positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,4), and the old body (5,3) is still there, so snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] length 3.\n> \n> Tail is now (5,3).\n> \n> No collision, since all positions distinct.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (1,6), far away; (5,1), below; (6,4), to the right.\n> \n> (6,4) is adjacent to head, since (5,4) and (6,4) are horizontal neighbors.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), so:\n> \n> - U: (5,5) with food\n> \n> - D: (5,3) but (5,3) is current tail, and moving there might be issue? Let's see.\n> \n> Moving to (5,3): if I move down to (5,3), which is the current tail position.\n> \n> Since the tail will move away after the move, it's generally safe to move to the tail cell because the tail leaves it.\n> \n> But in this case, since snake is only length 2, moving to (5,3): after move, head moves to (5,3), but (5,3) was tail, so when head moves to (5,3), the tail was there but moves away? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start: positions [(5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> I move head to new position.\n> \n> If I move down to (5,3), which is occupied by the tail.\n> \n> But rule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,3), the body segments: the old head (5,4) becomes the new body segment at (5,4)? No.\n> \n> Movement:\n> \n> - New head position: (5,3) if I move down.\n> \n> - Since no food at (5,3), I assume? (5,3) is not listed in food, so no food there.\n> \n> So snake moves: head to (5,3), and the body segment moves to where? Since only one body segment, it moves to the old head position, which is (5,4)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head goes to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for length 2 snake: head at P, tail at Q.\n> \n> After move to new head position R:\n> \n> - If R is not food, new head at R, new tail at P, so positions [R, P]\n> \n> - If R is food, new head at R, tail stays at Q, so positions [R, P, Q]\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,3): (5,3) is the current tail position.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3), and if there is no food, new positions: head at (5,3), and the body moves to old head position (5,4), so snake becomes [(5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> But (5,4) was head, now body, and (5,3) is head, which was tail.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, moving to tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (5,3), it should be safe, and snake would be [(5,3), (5,4)] with head direction D or something.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,3) has no food, so no growth.\n> \n> But is (5,3) a wall or something? No, walls are borders and internal obstacles, (5,3) is not listed, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Now back to choices for turn 5:\n> \n> Can move U, L, or R (since D is opposite and not allowed).\n> \n> - U: to (5,5) which has food.

So the snake has 3 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it just moved to (6,4) from the left, since previous position was (5,4).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 4. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 4 turns, so at turn 10.\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 4, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 4, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? No, borders are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on the edges, meaning we can only move in x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> It says \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell. Also internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> So playable cells are those not walls or obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - All cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Plus internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) are internal obstacles, so they are walls.\n> \n> (3,6) and (5,6) are also walls.\n> \n> (2,1) is a wall.\n> \n> Now snake: head (6,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3).\n> \n> Head direction R, so it moved right to (6,4), so from (5,4).\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (6,4):\n> \n> - Up: (6,5)\n> \n> - Down: (6,3)\n> \n> - Left: (5,4) but (5,4) is the body, so moving left would collide with body? But the tail is at (5,3), and body at (5,4). Since the snake moves, when it moves, the tail will move away.\n> \n> I need to remember the movement rules.\n> \n> When I move, the head goes to a new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if I move, the head goes to new cell, body segment that was at (5,4) goes to where head was? No.\n> \n> Snake positions: [head, segment1, segment2, ... tail]\n> \n> After move, new head position based on direction, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So here, positions: index 0: head (6,4), index 1: body (5,4), index 2: tail (5,3)\n> \n> If I move right to (7,4), but x=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n> \n> Similarly, up to (6,5), down to (6,3), left to (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) is currently occupied by the body, but after move, if I go left to (5,4), what happens?\n> \n> The rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except that in the case of the tail, since tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, because when the snake moves, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (5,4), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> After move, the head would be at (5,4), but that cell was occupied by the body segment, which is moving to where the head was? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,3)\n> \n> If I move left to (5,4):\n> \n> - New head position: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then seg1 moves to the previous head position: (6,4)\n> \n> - Seg2 (tail) moves to previous seg1 position: (5,4)? But (5,4) is now the new head position? Conflict.\n> \n> The new head is at (5,4), but seg1 was at (5,4), so when seg1 moves to (6,4), and seg2 moves to where seg1 was, which is (5,4), but (5,4) is now the head, so seg2 would move to (5,4), but head is already there, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's a collision because the head and the new position for seg2 are the same cell.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is not the tail; it's the body segment before tail.

So I can't move to any of those cells.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,5), then body segments at (6,4) and (5,4). So the snake has 3 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (6,5). Since direction is U, and head is at (6,5), it came from below, so previous position was (6,4) or something, but positions are given: from (6,5) to (6,4) to (5,4). Let's list them: index 0: (6,5) head, index 1: (6,4), index 2: (5,4). Since head direction is U, it moved up to (6,5), so from (6,4) to (6,5) was up.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 10, life span 1? It says value 10, life span 1? Let me read: \"(2, 4, 10, 1)\" and in the description it's \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", so for (2,4), value=10, life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, others have value=1, life_span=3.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t=7, for food at (5,5), life_span=3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current turn.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for a food with life_span L at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life_span is L at turn t, and countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, life_span = L, so after this turn, it becomes L-1\n> \n> - At turn t+1, life_span = L-1, after that L-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - At turn t + L - 1, life_span = 1, after that turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For example, food at (5,5) with life_span=3 at turn 7: it can be eaten on turn 7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) same, life_span=3, can be eaten turn 7,8,9.\n> \n> (5,1) same.\n> \n> (2,4) value=10, life_span=1. At turn 7, life_span=1, so it can be eaten only on turn 7. After turn 7, it disappears.\n> \n> Important: (2,4) has high value 10, but only available this turn.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since current direction is U, I cannot move D (down) next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> Grid size 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake: head (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> Food: (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), (2,4)\n> \n> (2,4) is food with value 10, life span 1, so only available now at turn 7.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's plot the positions.\n> \n> I'll sketch a grid mentally.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,5)\n> \n> Body at (6,4) and (5,4)\n> \n> So the tail is at (5,4)\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): but cannot, because reverse, and also direction U, so D not allowed.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,5), but x=7 is border wall, so (7,5) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so R to (7,5) is invalid.\n> \n> Also, (6,5) to (7,5): x=7 is wall, so cannot.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (6,6): what is (6,6)? Is it wall or obstacle?\n> \n> y=6 is not border wall, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (5,6) is an obstacle? (5,6) is listed, so yes, (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> (6,6) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm all cells.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), etc., not (6,6), so (6,6) is free. But is it occupied? Snake is at (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), so (6,6) is empty.\n> \n> - L: (5,5) - is there food? Yes, (5,5) is food with value 1, life span 3.\n> \n> - R: (7,5) - but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: to (6,4) - but (6,4) is occupied by body, and also, moving down is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> D to (6,4) is the body segment. But in snake, moving into the cell where the tail is might be ok if the tail moves, but let's see collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> But here, if I move D to (6,4), (6,4) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). Positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), tail (5,4). So (6,4) is the second segment, not tail.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,4), which is occupied by the body, it would be a collision because it's not the tail; the tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Rule: \"head touches any body segment\" except that you can move to the tail cell because tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is a body segment, not the tail, so moving to (6,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Also, moving down is reverse direction, which is not allowed.\n> \n> So D is invalid for two reasons.\n> \n> Therefore, possible actions at turn 7: U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, moving to (5,5) would eat the food there, since (5,5) has positive food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's the high-value food at (2,4) with value 10, but only this turn, life span 1.\n> \n> (2,4) is at x=2,y=4.\n> \n> Current head at (6,5), so how to get to (2,4) in one move? Impossible; it's 4 units away in x and 1 in y, so at least 4 moves away, but I need to eat it this turn, turn 7, but I can't reach it this turn. So I cannot eat (2,4) because it's too far and will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 7: it can be eaten only on turn 7. Since I'm at (6,5), I can't reach (2,4) in one move. So (2,4) is unattainable; I have to ignore it. It will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> So effectively, only the other food matters.\n> \n> Food left: (5,5), (1,6), (5,1), all with value 1 and life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 7,8,9.\n> \n> (5,5) is adjacent, at (5,5), which I can move to directly with L.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the state after possible moves.\n> \n> First, if I move L to (5,5) at turn 7:\n> \n> - I eat the food, so snake grows. Value +1, length increases.\n> \n> After eating, the snake: new head at (5,5), then the previous head (6,5) becomes body, then (6,4) body, then (5,4) tail. But since I ate, a new segment is added, so positions: new head (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,4), then (5,4). Length 4.\n> \n> Direction: I moved left, so new head direction L.\n> \n> Now, after this, what can I do?\n> \n> From (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse. Since I moved L, reverse would be R, so cannot move R to (6,5), which is now body.\n> \n> Available moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,6)\n> \n> - D: (5,4)\n> \n> - L: (4,5)\n> \n> - R: (6,5) but (6,5) is now body, and not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4), so moving to (5,4) might be ok? (5,4) is tail.\n> \n> If I move D to (5,4), (5,4) is the current tail. Since I eat at (5,5), the tail is still at (5,4) until I move. After moving to (5,5) and eating, the snake grows, so when I move next, the tail moves or stays?\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if it eats, a new segment is added at the tail position or something? I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Typically in snake: when head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> - If no food, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 7, I move head to (5,5), which has food, so I eat it, grow, so the body segments stay, and a new tail segment is added. So positions: head now at (5,5), then previous head (6,5) is body, then (6,4) is body, then (5,4) is tail, and since I grow, the tail stays, so positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)] after move.\n> \n> Now, for next move, from (5,5), I need to move to a neighbor.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,6): is (5,6) available? (5,6) is internal obstacle? Obstacles: (5,6) is listed, yes, (5,6) is an obstacle! Internal obstacles include (5,6), so cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)] so (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> So U to (5,6) is invalid.\n> \n> D to (5,4): (5,4) is the current tail. Since I just grew, (5,4) is tail, and if I move to (5,4), it should be ok because the tail will move when I move the head.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is allowed.\n> \n> L to (4,5): (4,5) should be free, no wall, no obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> R to (6,5): but (6,5) is now a body segment (the first body part), so if I move there, collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5) after eating: D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n> \n> If I move D to (5,4), that would be moving down, but since I moved left to (5,5), direction is L, so moving down is not reverse? Reverse would be opposite direction, L and R are horizontal, U and D vertical, so moving D from L is not reverse; it's perpendicular. Only opposite direction is disallowed.\n> \n> Current direction after move to (5,5) is L, so I cannot move R (right) but can move U, D, L.\n> \n> L is same direction, U and D are perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> So from (5,5), after eating, I can move D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (5,4): since (5,4) is tail, I move head to (5,4), and since no food there (food was at (5,5), eaten), so no eat, tail moves. Tail was at (5,4), but when head moves to (5,4), since it's the tail, and no eat, the tail should move to the next segment? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions before move: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,4), tail (5,4)\n> \n> I move head to (5,4). Since (5,4) was tail, and I move there, but (5,4) is occupied, but rule allows moving to tail cell.\n> \n> After head moves to (5,4), the snake moves: head now at (5,4), then the body segments follow. Since no eat, tail is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,4), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, then (6,5), then (6,4). Tail was (5,4), which is now head, so the last segment (6,4) is now tail? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: segments: 0: (5,5) head, 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (5,4) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4): new head at (5,4), but (5,4) was tail, so now segments: new head (5,4), then (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,4) is new tail? Since no eat, the last segment (tail) is removed, but when head moves to a new cell, the body shifts.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail end is removed.\n> \n> So from positions: [head, seg1, seg2, tail] = [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ]\n> \n> Move head to (5,4). Since (5,4) was tail, but now head moves there, and no food, so the new head is at (5,4), then the first body is (5,5), then (6,5), and the tail (5,4) is gone, so new tail is (6,4)? Let's index:\n> \n> After move: head to (5,4), which is the previous tail position, but since we move, the segment that was at (5,4) is now head, and the segment at (6,4) is now the last, and since no eat, it remains, but the tail is removed, so the new snake should be [ (5,4) head, (5,5), (6,5) ] and (6,4) is removed because tail moves forward? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Perhaps better to think: the snake moves forward, head to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So when head moves to a new cell, all segments shift: the new head position, then the previous head position becomes the new first body, and so on, and the last position (tail) is removed if no eat.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves from (5,5) to (5,4), new head at (5,4), then the body at (6,5) moves to (5,5), the body at (6,4) moves to (6,5), and the tail at (5,4) is left, but since head moved to (5,4), and it was occupied, but we're moving to it, so the segment at (5,4) is replaced? I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, the snake grows: the new head is at the new position, and all previous positions remain, so the tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> - If no food, the new head is at the new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, for moving to the tail cell:\n> \n> If head moves to the current tail position, and no food, then after move, the head is at that position, and the tail was there but moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, positions before: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ] with (5,4) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (5,4). Since (5,4) has no food (food was at (5,5), eaten earlier), so no eat.\n> \n> New head at (5,4), then the first body segment is the previous head (5,5), so it moves to (5,5)? No.\n> \n> The segments: the new position of segment 0 is the new cell (5,4).\n> \n> Then segment 1 is at the old position of segment 0, which is (5,5).\n> \n> Segment 2 is at the old position of segment 1, which is (6,5).\n> \n> Then segment 3 (tail) is at the old position of segment 2, which is (6,4).\n> \n> But there is no segment 3 anymore because length is 4, but after moving with no eat, length should be 4? No, when no eat, length remains the same, but the tail moves.\n> \n> Before move, 4 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell with no eat: new head at new position, then segment 1 at old head position, segment 2 at old segment 1 position, and the old tail position is removed, so only three segments? No.\n> \n> Positions: let's label:\n> \n> At time t, positions: P0(t) = head, P1(t), P2(t), P3(t) = tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell C:\n> \n> If C has food, then P0(t+1) = C, P1(t+1) = P0(t), P2(t+1) = P1(t), P3(t+1) = P2(t), P4(t+1) = P3(t)  new tail, so length +1.\n> \n> If no food, P0(t+1) = C, P1(t+1) = P0(t), P2(t+1) = P1(t), and P3(t) is removed, so no P3(t+1), new tail is P2(t+1) = P1(t), so positions: [C, P0(t), P1(t)] with length 3.\n> \n> In this case, before move at turn 7 to (5,5): positions were [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ] length 3.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5) and eating, positions: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ] length 4.\n> \n> Then at turn 8, from (5,5), move to (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) has no food, so no eat.\n> \n> New head at (5,4), then P1(t+1) = old head (5,5), P2(t+1) = old P1 (6,5), P3(t+1) = old P2 (6,4), and the old tail (5,4) is gone, but new head is at (5,4), which was old tail, so new positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), body (6,5), tail (6,4).\n> \n> Length still 4, no change.\n> \n> And (5,4) was tail, but now it's head, and tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> No collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (4,5) from (5,5), etc.\n> \n> Back to turn 7 decision.\n> \n> At turn 7, from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> If I move L to (5,5), I eat the food, grow to length 4, and from there, I can move D to (5,4) or L to (4,5) at turn 8.\n> \n> (5,4) is where the tail was, but after eating, it's body.\n> \n> Now, other option: move U to (6,6) at turn 7.\n> \n> (6,6) is not food, no food there, so no eat.\n> \n> After move: new head at (6,6), then body at (6,5), tail at (6,4).

Let's see: new head (5,4), then since no eat, the segments shift: the first body is at previous head position (5,5), second body at previous first body position (6,5), and the previous second body (6,4) becomes the new tail? But since no eat, the last segment is removed, so positions should be [ (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) ] with tail at (6,5).

So if life span is given as 2 at turn t, it means:\n> \n> - At turn t, countdown is 2\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes 1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t+2? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N at turn t:\n> \n> - It can be eaten on turns where countdown > 0.\n> \n> - Countdown decreases by 1 each turn, starting from the turn it is present.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown = N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: countdown = 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: countdown = 0, disappears; cannot be eaten on or after this turn.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (1,6): at turn 8, life span 2, so countdown=2 on turn 8. Can be eaten on turn 8 or 9. On turn 10, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): value 1, life span 2, same as above.\n> \n> (2,4): value 1, life span 9, so it will last a long time, until turn 8 + 9 - 1? Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn 8, life span 9, so:\n> \n> - Turn 8: countdown=9\n> \n> - Turn 9: countdown=8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 16: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 17: countdown=0, disappears.\n> \n> But since life span is long, it's not urgent.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,5), direction L (left). So last move was left to (5,5).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn. Because \"no instant reverse\".\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5): U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions.\n> \n> First, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,6) – is this a wall or obstacle?\n> \n> Walls: border x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. (5,6): y=6, which is not 0 or 7? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is fine. x=5, not 0 or 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (5,6) is an obstacle! So (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, down: (5,4) – but (5,4) is the tail position. Is it safe to move there?\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is safe, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Left: (4,5) – what is there? Currently, snake positions are (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). So (4,5) is empty? Let me see the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), tail (5,4)\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5):\n> \n> - U: (5,6) – but (5,6) is an obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> - D: (5,4) – this is the tail. Since tail will move, it should be safe.\n> \n> - L: (4,5) – let's check: not a wall, not an obstacle, not a body part except tail which is at (5,4), so (4,5) is empty? Current snake positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). So (4,5) is free.\n> \n> (4,5) is not occupied by snake or obstacle.\n> \n> - R: (6,5) – but (6,5) is the body segment. Rule: head touches any body segment except tail is collision. (6,5) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is (5,4). So moving to (6,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Also, cannot move right anyway because it's opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,6): value +1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 9 (since turn 8 or 9)\n> \n> - (5,1): value +1, life span 2, same, must be eaten by turn 9\n> \n> - (2,4): value +1, life span 9, plenty of time\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,4). Is there food on tail? No, food positions are (1,6), (5,1), (2,4), none on (5,4).\n> \n> But if we eat food, the snake grows, so tail moves differently.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for visualization.\n> \n> Grid 8x8:\n> \n> y=7: top\n> \n> y=0: bottom\n> \n> x=0 left, x=7 right\n> \n> Obstacles:\n> \n> (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake: (5,5) head, (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail\n> \n> Food: (1,6), (5,1), (2,4)\n> \n> Current turn: 8\n> \n> Life spans: (1,6) life span 2, so after turn 8, if not eaten, countdown to 1 on turn 9, gone turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,1).\n> \n> (2,4) life span 9, so many turns.\n> \n> Now, possible actions at turn 8:\n> \n> - Move L to (4,5)\n> \n> - Move D to (5,4)\n> \n> If move D to (5,4): head moves to (5,4), which is current tail. Then the snake body moves: new head (5,4), then (5,5) becomes body, (6,5) becomes body, (6,4) becomes tail? Let's see.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So if head moves to (5,4), which was tail, then:\n> \n> - New head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then next segment: previous head position (5,5)\n> \n> - Then (6,5)\n> \n> - Then (6,4) should be the tail, but (6,4) was the third segment, now it moves to where (6,5) was?

(5,3) to (5,1) is two more moves, turn 10, but on turn 10 it disappears, so cannot eat (5,1) at all?

It's turn 9. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6). Snake positions are: head at (4,5), then body at (5,5), (6,5), and tail at (6,4). Head direction is left, so from (4,5), it was moving left to (5,5)? No, the positions are listed as [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)], so head is at (4,5), next segment is (5,5), then (6,5), then tail at (6,4). Since head direction is L (left), that means it's moving towards decreasing x, so from (5,5) to (4,5)? Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is first, so at turn 9, head is at (4,5). Previous position was (5,5) at turn 8, I assume, since it moved left to (4,5). But the direction given is the current head direction, which is L, meaning it's facing left, so from (4,5), it can move left, up, or down, but not right because that would be instant reverse. Since it moved left to get to (4,5), it came from (5,5), so it cannot move right to (5,5) because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 1\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 1\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life span 8? Value is 1 for all, but life span: (1,6) life span 1, (5,1) life span 1, (2,4) life span 8 and value 1? The format is (x,y, life_span, value), I think. Let's see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 6, 1, 1) - (5, 1, 1, 1) - (2, 4, 8, 1)\" So for (1,6), it's at (1,6), life span 1, value 1; similarly (5,1) life span 1, value 1; (2,4) life span 8, value 1. All positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6) and (5,1), life span is 1, meaning they disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 9, life span 1 means it will disappear at the end of turn 9 if not eaten. So if I don't eat it this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) has life span 8, so it will last until turn 9 + 8 - 1? Let's think: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so after turn t + N - 1? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> For example, food with life span 1 at turn t: it is present at turn t, and disappears after turn t, so not available for turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 2: present at turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> So for (1,6) at turn 9, life span 1: it will disappear after this turn, so must be eaten on turn 9 or not at all.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,1), life span 1, must be eaten on turn 9 or gone.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 8, so it will be available from turn 9 to turn 16 inclusive, since after 8 turns: turn 9 to 16 is 8 turns? From turn 9 to turn 16 is 8 days, but let's count:\n> \n> At turn 9, life span 8: it decreases by 1 each turn.\n> \n> After turn 9, life span 7; after turn 10, life span 6; ... after turn 16, life span 0, disappears after turn 16. So it can be eaten from turn 9 to turn 16.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,5), direction left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5): U (up, to (4,6)), D (down, to (4,4)), L (left, to (3,5)), R (right, to (5,5)). But R is to (5,5), which is the body segment, but since it's the neck, and the snake will move, we need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> In snake games, moving into the cell where the neck is might be okay because the neck moves away when the head moves, but only if it's the immediate next segment.\n> \n> Standard rule: the head can move to the tail cell because the tail moves, but not to other body cells.\n> \n> Here, positions: head (4,5), next segment (5,5), then (6,5), tail (6,4).\n> \n> So if head moves right to (5,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. But when the snake moves, if head goes to (5,5), the body segments follow: the segment at (5,5) would move to where? Let's simulate.\n> \n> If snake moves right to (5,5), then the new head is at (5,5). The previous head was (4,5), which becomes part of body? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (5,5), which was occupied by the first body segment, but since the first body segment will move away, it should be okay, as long as it's not colliding with another body part.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to the cell that will be vacated by the tail or the moving body is safe.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) is the position of the first body segment. When head moves to (5,5), the first body segment (which was at (5,5)) will move to the previous head position? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Current positions: head (4,5), body1 (5,5), body2 (6,5), tail (6,4).\n> \n> If head moves right to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head position: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then body1 moves to where head was, (4,5)\n> \n> - Body2 moves to where body1 was, (5,5)? But (5,5) is now the head, so body2 moves to (5,5), which is occupied? Conflict.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> But for collision: during the move, the head should not collide with any body segment except possibly the tail, because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,5) which is currently body1: after the move, body1 will have moved to (4,5), so the cell (5,5) is now the head, and body1 is at (4,5), body2 at (6,5) moves to where body1 was, which is (5,5)? No.\n> \n> Positions before move:\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,5)\n> \n> Index 1: body1 (5,5)\n> \n> Index 2: body2 (6,5)\n> \n> Index 3: tail (6,4)\n> \n> After head moves to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then body1 moves to the position of previous head, which is (4,5)\n> \n> - Body2 moves to the position of previous body1, which was (5,5) — but (5,5) is now occupied by new head? So when body2 tries to move to (5,5), it collides with head.\n> \n> That's a collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving directly into a body segment that is not the tail causes collision because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> But the tail is different because it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) is body1, not the tail. Tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> So moving to (5,5) would cause head to be at same position as body1 after move, but since body1 moves to (4,5), the cell is vacated, but during the move sequence, it might be considered collision.\n> \n> Typically, in snake games, the head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> Here, (5,5) is not the tail; it's the first body segment.

Also, internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6). I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). So the snake is horizontal, facing left, with head at (3,5), tail at (6,5). Since it's moving left, the direction is L, so from (4,5) to (3,5) is left, which matches.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 1.

So I can eat it only on turn 10 if I move there now.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (5,1) with life span 1 on turn 10, that means it will be present only on turn 10. After turn 10, it's gone. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (5,1): value 1, life span 1 → only available on turn 10.\n> \n> Food at (2,4): value 7, life span 1? Wait, the input says: (2,4,7,1) – I think that's (x,y,value,life_span).

Life span 10 on turn 10 means it will disappear after turn 19? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, if life_span is N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + N - 1? I need to think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span L.

Let's check: not border wall, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (3,4) is not listed, and not border, so should be free. Also not occupied by snake? Snake is at (3,5), (4,5), etc., all at y=5 except head is at x=3,y=5, so (3,4) is empty.\n> \n> - L: (2,5) - x=2,y=5.

If I move right, head goes to (4,5), which is occupied by the body, so collision, death. But there's a rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But (4,5) is not the tail; tail is at (6,5). The segments are: head (3,5), then body (4,5), body (5,5), tail (6,5). So (4,5) is a body segment, not tail. If I move to (4,5), it's a body collision, since head touches body segment.\n> \n> Only the tail cell is safe to move into because when head moves to tail, tail moves away, so no collision. But here, moving to (4,5) which is the neck or something, it's not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, R is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Also, U is invalid because (3,6) is wall.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5) are D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) and (2,4) must be eaten this turn or they disappear.

(2,4) is at (2,4), head at (3,5). Possible moves: to (2,5) or (3,4) or (4,5) but (4,5) is body, invalid. (3,5) to (2,4) is diagonal? No, moves are only up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) wall, (3,4) down, (2,5) left, (4,5) body invalid. None of these is (2,4). So indeed, I cannot reach (2,4) in one move; it's not adjacent. Similarly, (5,1) is far away.\n> \n> Therefore, food at (2,4) and (5,1) cannot be eaten on turn 10; they will disappear after this turn.

There are also internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6). So I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments at (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5). So the snake is four segments long. Head direction is down, which means it was moving downward to (3,4) from (3,5)? Positions are listed head first: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. Since head is at (3,4) and direction is D, that means it moved down to (3,4) from the previous head position. But the previous head position was probably (3,5) before moving down to (3,4). Let's see the positions: (3,4) is head, then (3,5) is the next segment, which was the head before, and so on. Direction D means the last move was downward, so from (3,5) to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life span 7. Life span 7 means it disappears after 7 turns, including this one, so it will vanish after turn 17 (11 + 7 - 1? Let's calculate: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 11, life span is 7, meaning it has 7 turns left including turn 11. After turn 11, it will have 6 left, and so on, until turn 17 it has 0 and disappears. Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 9, so it will disappear after turn 19 (11 + 9 - 1? Turn 11: life=9, turn 12:8, ..., turn 19: life=1, then after turn 19 it disappears? No: life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, life span N means it will be there for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - On turn t, it exists, life span N\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes N-1\n> \n> - So it exists until turn t + N - 1, because on turn t + N - 1, life span is 1, and after that turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.

Also, direction U is opposite to D, so it's not allowed anyway. So U is invalid.\n> \n> - D: down to (3,3). Is (3,3) safe? Let's check: walls? x=3, y=3. Border walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so y=3 is not border. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,3) is not listed, so it should be free. Snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), so (3,3) is not occupied. So D to (3,3) seems possible.\n> \n> - L: left to (2,4). (2,4) is where the food is! But let's check if it's safe.

Snake positions: (2,4) is not in the list, so it's empty except for the food. So moving to (2,4) would eat the food.\n> \n> - R: right to (4,4). (4,4): not wall, not obstacle, not snake position, so should be free.\n> \n> So possible moves: D, L, R. U is invalid.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (2,4), I eat the food, since head moves there.

Length 5, tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, is head adjacent to tail? Head at (2,4), tail at (5,5). Distance: |2-5|=3, |4-5|=1, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (2,4) and (5,5) are not adjacent; (2,4) to (5,5) is two steps away horizontally and one down, so not adjacent. Safe.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> The food at (2,4) has life span 7, so it will be there for a while, but I might want to eat it soon or later, depending on strategy.\n> \n> There's another food at (4,2) with longer life span.\n> \n> But let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, I should consider the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. But walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the snake can be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so moving to any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall collision. So the valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So let's list all obstacles:\n> \n> - All border cells: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x.\n> \n> - Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> Food: (2,4), (4,2)\n> \n> I need to maximize score, so eat both if possible, but with survival first.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so it might block paths.\n> \n> Current turn 11.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 11:\n> \n> - Move L to (2,4): eat food, snake grows to length 5, new head (2,4)\n> \n> - Move D to (3,3): no food, head to (3,3), snake moves, tail moves to (4,5)?

Walls: not border. Obstacles: no. Snake: after move, positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So (2,5) is free? Let's see: (2,5) not in positions, not obstacle.

It's turn 12. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume. Walls at all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with internal obstacles blocking some cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So, cells to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,4), then body: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So, the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,4) from previous position.\n> \n> Food: only one food at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Since current turn is 12, it will disappear after 8 turns, so at turn 20. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 12, life span becomes 7, then 6, and so on, until turn 20 when it disappears.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) is positive, value +1, so eating it would increase snake length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid for clarity. Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6)\n> \n> (2,1) is at bottom, (1,3) left, (2,3) also left, (3,6) top, (5,6) top.\n> \n> Snake: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So, from head: (2,4) ← L direction, then (3,4) which is right of head? Let's list positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,4)  // this is to the right of head, since head is at (2,4), and direction is L, so head moved left to (2,4), meaning previous head was at (3,4) or something? No.\n> \n> Snake positions are given in order: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> With head first. Head direction is L, so the snake was moving left when it arrived at (2,4). That means from turn 11, head was at (3,4), and moved left to (2,4) on turn 12.\n> \n> But on turn 12, positions are given, so head at (2,4), which it just moved to by going left from previous position.\n> \n> The body segments: after head, (3,4) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position. Then (3,5), which might have been the head before that, etc.\n> \n> To understand the snake's shape: from (2,4) to (3,4) is east, since x increased from 2 to 3? No: positions: (2,4), then (3,4) — that's increasing x, so right direction, but head direction is left, so at this moment, the segment from head to next is from (2,4) to (3,4), which is east, so the snake is bending.\n> \n> Let's plot coordinates:\n> \n> - (2,4): head\n> \n> - (3,4): neck, directly right of head\n> \n> - (3,5): up from neck? y=5 > y=4, so north, assuming y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but since walls are at y=0 and y=7, and no indication, I think we can assume y increases upwards, like standard coordinates.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if y+1 is up, then y increases upwards. So (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (2,4), then (3,4) at same y, x+1, so east.\n> \n> Then (3,5): same x, y+1, so north from (3,4).\n> \n> Then (4,5): x+1, same y, east from (3,5).\n> \n> Then (5,5): x+1, same y, east from (4,5).\n> \n> So the snake: head at (2,4), then body goes to (3,4) (east), then to (3,5) (north), then to (4,5) (east), then to (5,5) (east). So it's like a short snake with a bend.\n> \n> Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (2,4) from (3,4), but since (3,4) is now the neck, the direction is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,2), which is at x=4, y=2. Since y=0 is bottom, y=2 is two above bottom, but walls at y=0, so playable from y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> y=2 is row 2.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 12 and beyond, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current turn t1=12, so I need to output actions for turn 12, 13, 14, etc., but since I have to think ahead, I should simulate possible moves.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current head position (2,4) with direction L (left).\n> \n> Since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1).\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> Current position: (2,4)\n> \n> Move U: to (2,5)\n> \n> Is (2,5) valid? Not a wall and not body except possibly tail.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,5) is within 1-6 in x and y, x=2, y=5, both between 1 and 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6). (2,5) not in this list, so no obstacle.\n> \n> Body positions: (2,4) is head, moving away, so not occupied after move. Body segments: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). (2,5) not in these, so safe to move to.\n> \n> Move D: to (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3): is it wall or body? Internal obstacle at (2,3)? Yes, internal obstacles include (2,3), so (2,3) is an obstacle, cannot move there. Also, it might be wall, but specifically listed as internal obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> Move L: to (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4): x=1, y=4. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is playable, not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,3) is obstacle, but (1,4) not listed, so should be ok? List: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (1,3) is obstacle, but (1,4) is not mentioned, so it should be free.\n> \n> Body positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). (1,4) not in these, so safe.\n> \n> Now, move R is not possible because instant reverse, current direction L, opposite R not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, L. D is invalid because obstacle.\n> \n> D to (2,3) is obstacle, so only U or L possible for turn 12.\n> \n> But I need to plan sequence, not just one move.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,2) with life span 8, so from turn 12, it has 8 turns left, including turn 12? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 12, life span 8, after turn 12, it becomes 7, and so on, until turn 19 it has 1, then after turn 19, on turn 20 it disappears. But eating happens when head moves onto food, so as long as head moves to it before or on turn 19, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 12: life span 8, after turn 12, life span 7 (before turn 13), turn 13: life span 6, ..., turn 19: life span 1, after turn 19, life span 0, so on turn 20 it's gone. So to eat, head must be on (4,2) on turn 13 to 19 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The food is present as long as life span > 0. At turn t, if life span S, after the turn, S decreases by 1. So on turn t, if head moves to food, it can eat it if S > 0 for that turn.\n> \n> Typically, the food is available during the turn if life span > 0 at start of turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"eating\" happens when head moves onto the cell during a turn.\n> \n> So, at start of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present. After the turn, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> If head moves to food cell on turn t, it eats it, and L becomes 0 or something, but since it disappears after, it's gone.\n> \n> For this food, at turn 12, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 12 to turn 19. On turn 20, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, position: head at (2,4), food at (4,2). Distance: x from 2 to 4, delta x=2, y from 4 to 2, delta y=-2, so Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| = 2 + 2 = 4. So at least 4 moves to reach, but with obstacles, might be longer.\n> \n> I need to go towards food but safely.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake body changes.\n> \n> Current snake length 5, after eating positive food, length increases by 1, so new segment added when it eats.\n> \n> Now, for turn 12, possible moves: U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U to (2,5).\n> \n> After move U to (2,5), new head position (2,5), body becomes: since head moved, tail moves? When snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead.\n> \n> After move: positions: new head (2,5), then previous head (2,4) becomes neck, then (3,4), then (3,5), then (4,5), and tail (5,5) moves to (4,5)? Let's sequence.\n> \n> Initial positions: [head: (2,4), s1: (3,4), s2: (3,5), s3: (4,5), tail: (5,5)]\n> \n> After moving head to (2,5), the new positions: head: (2,5), then s1 takes (2,4) (previous head), s2 takes (3,4) (previous s1), s3 takes (3,5) (previous s2), and tail takes (4,5) (previous s3). Previous tail (5,5) is left, so snake is now [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] with tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Length still 5, no food eaten.\n> \n> Head direction now U, since moved up.\n> \n> Now, from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n> \n> But current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n> \n> Also, check walls and body.\n> \n> (2,6): y=6, not border, y=7 wall, so y=6 ok. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Body: after move, positions (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). (2,6) not occupied, so U possible.\n> \n> D to (2,4): but (2,4) is now the neck position, occupied by body. So moving to (2,4) would collide with body. Also, since current direction U, D is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> L to (1,5): x=1,y=5. Not wall, no obstacle, body not there, so possible.\n> \n> R to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied by body segment s3, which is at (3,5) after move? After move, positions: head (2,5), s1 (2,4), s2 (3,4), s3 (3,5), tail (4,5). So (3,5) is occupied by s3, so moving to (3,5) would collide with body. Also, not opposite direction, but occupied.\n> \n> So from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5).

Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food: two pieces.\n> \n> - First: at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 7. Since life span decreases each turn, including current, it will disappear after 7 more turns? Life span is given as 7 at turn 13, so it disappears when countdown reaches 0, which would be after 7 turns, so at turn 20? Let me clarify the life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, disappearing when countdown reaches 0. At turn 13, life_span is 7, so after 7 turns, at turn 20, it should be gone? Countdown decreases every turn including current, but when we say \"disappears after N turns\", it might mean it lasts for N turns from now.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think \"disappears after N turns\" means it will vanish after N more turns. For example, at turn t with life_span N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, ..., to 0 at turn t+N, and disappears before turn t+N+1 or something. But since countdown decreases on the turn it's present, I think it's visible for N turns starting from the turn it's spawned.\n> \n> But in this case, at turn 13, life_span 7 means it has 7 turns left, including turn 13. So after 7 decreases, it will be gone. So it exists from turn 13 to turn 19 (since at turn 13 countdown=7, turn 14 countdown=6, ..., turn 19 countdown=1, turn 20 countdown=0 and it disappears). But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> To be precise: let's assume that at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it is present during turn t. At the end of turn t, life_span decreases by 1. If after decrease, life_span=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to know when it's available.\n> \n> Since the countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, I think for food at (4,2) with life_span 7 at turn 13:\n> \n> - Turn 13: life_span=7, present\n> \n> - Turn 14: life_span=6, present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 19: life_span=1, present\n> \n> - Turn 20: life_span=0, disappears, not present\n> \n> Similarly for the other food at (6,6) with life_span 10: present from turn 13 to turn 22 (since 10 turns: 13 to 22 inclusive? Let's count: turn 13:10, 14:9, ..., 22:1, 23:0 disappear. So present turns 13 to 22.\n> \n> But at turn 13, we are deciding action for turn 13, so food is present now.\n> \n> Second food: (6,6) value 1, life_span 10.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,4), direction L, so last move was left to (1,4) from (2,4)? Positions are [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)], so head at (1,4), which it moved to from (2,4) by going left. So current direction is L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because reverse is not allowed? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But since current head direction is L, I cannot move R (opposite) on this turn.\n> \n> So for turn 13, possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 rows and 8 columns, with borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Food: (4,2) and (6,6)\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.

Usually y=0 at bottom, but in coordinates, it might not matter, but let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top for simplicity, but since movement is defined with U as (x,y+1), so y increases up.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n> \n> Similarly, D is (x,y-1), down.\n> \n> L (x-1,y), left.\n> \n> R (x+1,y), right.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.

Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n  \n- **Snake Position and Direction**: \n  - Head at (1,5), direction is Up (U).\n  - Body segments: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)] (head first, tail last).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,2): value +1, lifespan 6 (can be eaten until Turn 19).\n  - (6,6): value +1, lifespan 9 (can be eaten until Turn 22).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 14\n\nFrom the head position (1,5) with current direction U, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (1,6)**:\n   - (1,6) is within bounds and not obstructed by walls or obstacles.\n   - Snake body: (1,6) is not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (1,4)**:\n   - (1,4) is the second segment of the snake's body.\n   - Collision rules: Moving into a body segment that is not the tail causes a collision.\n   - Invalid move (would collide with body).\n\n3. **Left (L) to (0,5)**:\n   - x=0 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid move (wall collision).\n\n4. **Right (R) to (2,5)**:\n   - (2,5) is within bounds and not obstructed.\n   - Snake body: (2,5) is not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n**Valid Moves**: U or R.\n\n### Evaluating Move U to (1,6)\n\nIf we choose U:\n\n- New head position: (1,6), direction U.\n- Snake body updates: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)], tail at (3,4) (since (3,5) is removed).\n  \nAt Turn 15 from (1,6), direction U:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (1,7) is y=7 (wall) → invalid.\n  - D: (1,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (0,6) is x=0 (wall) → invalid.\n  - R: (2,6) is free → valid.\n\nOnly move is R to (2,6).\n\nAt Turn 16 from (2,6), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (2,7) is y=7 (wall) → invalid.\n  - D: (2,5) is free → valid.\n  - L: (1,6) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (3,6) is obstacle → invalid.\n\nOnly move is D to (2,5).\n\nContinuing this path leads the snake towards the top-right but may not reach any food before they expire. Specifically, reaching (4,2) by Turn 19 seems unlikely from this path.\n\n### Evaluating Move R to (2,5)\n\nIf we choose R:\n\n- New head position: (2,5), direction R.\n- Snake body updates: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)], tail at (3,4).\n\nAt Turn 15 from (2,5), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (2,6) is free → valid.\n  - D: (2,4) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (1,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (3,5) is free → valid.\n\nChoose R to (3,5) to head towards the center.\n\nAt Turn 16 from (3,5), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (3,6) is obstacle → invalid.\n  - D: (3,4) is free → valid.\n  - L: (2,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (4,5) is free → valid.\n\nChoose D to (3,4) to start descending towards (4,2).\n\nAt Turn 17 from (3,4), direction D:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (3,5) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (2,4) is free → valid.\n  - R: (4,4) is free → valid.\n  - D: Not applicable (no reverse).\n\nChoose R to (4,4) to continue towards (4,2).\n\nAt Turn 18 from (4,4), direction R:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (4,5) is free → valid.\n  - D: (4,3) is free → valid.\n  - L: (3,4) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - R: (5,4) is free → valid.\n\nChoose D to (4,3) to approach (4,2).\n\nAt Turn 19 from (4,3), direction D:\n\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (4,4) is body segment → collision → invalid.\n  - L: (3,3) is free → valid.\n  - R: (5,3) is free → valid.\n  - D: (4,2) is food → valid and can be eaten (lifespan 1 at Turn 19).\n\nChoose D to (4,2) to eat the food, increasing score by +1 and snake length by 1.\n\n### Comparing Both Paths\n\n- **U Path**: Leads snake towards top, may not reach food in time, higher risk of getting stuck.\n- **R Path**: Efficiently moves towards (4,2), ensuring the food is eaten before it expires, with a clear and safe path.\n\n### Avoiding Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (3,4) when moving towards (4,2), which is not adjacent to the head at any point where food is eaten, so no danger.\n- **Collisions**: All moves avoid body segments except the tail when safe.\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: All moves are checked against walls and internal obstacles.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe optimal immediate action at Turn 14 is to move **Right (R)** to (2,5), initiating a path that safely leads to eating the positive food at (4,2) by Turn 19, maximizing the score while ensuring the snake's survival.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nTo clearly outline the planned moves:\n\n1. **Turn 14**: R to (2,5)\n2. **Turn 15**: R to (3,5)\n3. **Turn 16**: D to (3,4)\n4. **Turn 17**: R to (4,4)\n5. **Turn 18**: D to (4,3)\n6. **Turn 19**: D to (4,2) (eat food)\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the immediate action at Turn 14, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 14 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 6), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 2, 6, 1)\n\t- (6, 6, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 14 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 14. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, minus the obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n> \n> Food: two pieces. First at (4,2) with life span 6 and value +1. Second at (6,6) with life span 9 and value +1. Both are positive food.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a 7x7 grid since walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (1,5), body (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), tail (3,5). Head direction U, so it came from below, meaning it was at (1,4) before moving to (1,5)? No.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed as [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)]. Since head is first, at turn 14, head is at (1,5), and it moved to there from (1,4) because the positions show the current segments. Head direction is U, which is (x,y+1), so moving up increases y.\n> \n> Standard coordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, but in grid terms, y often increases upwards or downwards. The movement U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I think. Let's confirm.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) – so if y+1, and we start from y=0 at bottom, then U is up. But walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I assume. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In the state, border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells like (0,y) or (x,0) are walls.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now obstacles: (3,6), but y=6 is the top row, since y=7 is wall, y=6 is the highest playable y? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6 are playable, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Let's define.\n> \n> Assume (x,y) with x increasing right, y increasing up. So:\n> \n> - Bottom row: y=1\n> \n> - Top row: y=6 (since y=7 is wall)\n> \n> Similarly, left column x=1, right column x=6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (3,6): x=3, y=6 – top row\n> \n> (2,1): x=2, y=1 – bottom row\n> \n> (1,3): x=1, y=3\n> \n> (2,3): x=2, y=3\n> \n> (5,6): x=5, y=6 – top row\n> \n> Now snake: positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). So let's plot:\n> \n> - (1,5): head\n> \n> - (1,4): below head\n> \n> - (2,4): right of (1,4)\n> \n> - (3,4): right of (2,4)\n> \n> - (3,5): above (3,4) – so tail is at (3,5)\n> \n> From the positions, the snake is like: from (1,5) down to (1,4), then right to (2,4), right to (3,4), then up to (3,5). So it's a bit bent.\n> \n> Head direction is U, meaning it just moved up to (1,5) from (1,4), I assume, since positions show current, and direction is the last move.\n> \n> Food: (4,2) with life span 6, value +1. (4,2) is x=4, y=2, which is near bottom.\n> \n> (6,6) with life span 9, value +1. (6,6) is top-right corner.\n> \n> Life span: food disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So for (4,2), life span 6 at turn 14, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's see: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at the turn when food is spawned, life_span is given. After that turn, life_span decreases by 1 each turn. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something. But for eating, as long as it's present, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is L at turn t, it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> But in this case, turn t_1 = 14.\n> \n> For food at (4,2): life_span 6, so at turn 14, it has life_span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 more turns? \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N full turns from now.\n> \n> Let's interpret: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the turn it's presented, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after k turns, countdown is N - k. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,2): life_span 6 at turn 14. After turn 14, countdown becomes 5, and so on. It can be eaten as long as countdown > 0.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6): life_span 9 at turn 14.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 14 and beyond, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current possible moves: from head position (1,5), with head direction U (up). Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since head direction is U, which is up, the opposite is D (down), so I cannot move down on the next turn. So from (1,5), I can move U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (1,5):\n> \n> - U (up): (1,6) – y=6, which is playable? y=6 is within 1 to 6, so yes, but is it blocked? Obstacles: (3,6) and (5,6), but (1,6) is not an obstacle, so it should be free, but let's check walls.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,6) is x=1,y=6, which is not a border wall, and no internal obstacle there, so should be free.\n> \n> But is there snake body? Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). So (1,6) is not occupied by snake or obstacle, so moving U to (1,6) is possible.\n> \n> - D (down): to (1,4). But (1,4) is the second segment of the snake. If I move down, head goes to (1,4), which is currently occupied by the body.\n> \n> But the rule about collisions: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Important: if I move to a cell where the tail is, and the tail moves away, it might be ok, but I need to see the tail position.\n> \n> Current tail is at (3,5). If I move to (1,4), which is the neck, not tail.\n> \n> Let's list all body segments: index 0: head (1,5), index 1: (1,4), index 2: (2,4), index 3: (3,4), index 4: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move down to (1,4), which is occupied by index 1 segment. After the move, the head would be at (1,4), and the body segments shift. The new head is at (1,4), but the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, and if food eaten, tail not removed, length increases.\n> \n> But for collision, when moving, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But in this case, (1,4) is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). So moving to (1,4) would cause collision because it's a body segment that isn't the tail.\n> \n> Let me confirm the rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only the tail cell is safe to move into if it moves away. Here, (1,4) is the second segment, not tail, so moving to (1,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move down to (1,4).\n> \n> Similarly, moving left: L is (x-1,y), so from (1,5) to (0,5). But x=0 is a wall, since border x=0 is wall. So moving to (0,5) is wall collision, not allowed.\n> \n> Moving right: R to (2,5). Is (2,5) free? Check obstacles: internal obstacles are (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6). (2,5) is not listed, and not border, so should be free. Snake body: positions are (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). (2,5) not occupied, so moving R to (2,5) should be possible.\n> \n> Moving up: U to (1,6). (1,6) is y=6, which is top, but not border wall (y=7 is wall), and no obstacle at (1,6), snake not there, so possible.\n> \n> So possible moves from (1,5) at turn 14: U, R, or L but L to (0,5) wall, not possible. D not possible due to body collision. So only U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid 6x6, cells (x,y) with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders not included, but obstacles:\n> \n> - (1,3): occupied\n> \n> - (2,1): occupied\n> \n> - (2,3): occupied\n> \n> - (3,6): occupied\n> \n> - (5,6): occupied\n> \n> Also, snake occupies: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> Food: (4,2) and (6,6)\n> \n> Free cells: all others.\n> \n> Now, life span: (4,2) life 6 at turn 14, so if not eaten, disappears after countdown to 0. Countdown: after turn 14, it decreases to 5, then 4, etc. It can be eaten until countdown >0.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6) life 9.\n> \n> I need to maximize score, so I should eat positive food when possible, but avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, there might be negative food, but in this state, both are positive, value +1.\n> \n> Now, plan actions.\n> \n> Current turn 14, head at (1,5), direction U.\n> \n> Options: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n> \n> If I go U to (1,6), then at (1,6), which is top row. From there, possible moves: since moved U, head direction U, so cannot move D next.\n> \n> From (1,6), y=6, which is top, so cannot move U further, only L, R, or D.\n> \n> But L to (0,6) wall, not possible. R to (2,6), or D to (1,5).\n> \n> (1,5) is where the neck was, but after move, when head moves to (1,6), the body moves: head to (1,6), segment 1 (was (1,4)) moves to (1,5)? Let's think snake movement.\n> \n> After move: if head moves to new cell, say (1,6), then the new positions: head (1,6), then the previous head becomes body, so (1,5) becomes segment 1, (1,4) becomes segment 2, (2,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, and tail (3,5) is removed since no food eaten? When no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, no food at (1,6), so after moving to (1,6), new snake positions: head (1,6), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). Tail was (3,5), but since no food, the tail cell is vacated, and the new tail is the last segment, which was (3,4)? Positions: after move, the segments shift: new head at (1,6), then the first body segment is the old head (1,5), then (1,4), then (2,4), then (3,4) as tail. So tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Original: [ (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After move U to (1,6): head to (1,6), so new positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ] and (3,5) is removed. So tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (2,5): new positions [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ], tail at (3,4), (3,5) removed.\n> \n> Back to turn 14 choice.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (1,6) at turn 14.\n> \n> Then at (1,6), head direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 15, from (1,6), possible moves: since direction U, cannot move D. U not possible (y=6 top). L to (0,6) wall, impossible. So only R to (2,6) or D to (1,5).\n> \n> D to (1,5): (1,5) is now occupied by the body segment (since after move, (1,5) is body). In the new positions, (1,5) is the second segment. Moving to (1,5) would cause collision because it's a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,4) now. So (1,5) is not tail, so cannot move D.\n> \n> Thus only possible move from (1,6) is R to (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is free? Check: obstacles: (3,6) and (5,6), not (2,6). Snake not there.

It's turn 16. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So the snake has 5 segments.

Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn. So for (4,2), life span 4 at turn 16, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's clarify: life span decreases every turn, so at turn 16, it has 4 turns left, meaning it disappears at the start of turn 20 or something. I need to be careful with the counting.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists for N more turns. So at turn t, it has N turns left including turn t. After N turns, it disappears. For example, at turn 16, life span 4: it will be there on turns 16,17,18,19, and disappear before turn 20. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 16.

Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (3,4) is within bounds, and not an internal obstacle listed. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).

Distance: |4-3|=1, |4-5|=1, so it's diagonal, not adjacent for movement. Movement is only horizontal/vertical, so to reach (4,4) from (3,5), I need at least two moves, e.g., right then down, or down then right.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is at (4,2), from (3,5), that's further.\n> \n> (6,6) is far.\n> \n> Since I need to plan 5+ turns, I should consider paths to food while avoiding dead ends or collisions.\n> \n> Also, the tail situation. Tail is at (2,4). Head is at (3,5). Are they adjacent? Positions: (3,5) and (2,4). |3-2|=1, |5-4|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right, not diagonal. So (3,5) adjacent cells: (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5). (2,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal.\n> \n> So no immediate tail collision risk.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the snake's body. After moving, the tail will move when the snake moves, unless it eats food. If no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be free later.\n> \n> Current tail is (2,4). When snake moves, if no food, tail moves to next segment, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Snake positions: indices: head [0]=(3,5), [1]=(2,5), [2]=(1,5), [3]=(1,4), [4]=(2,4) tail.\n> \n> When snake moves, new head position based on action, and if no food eaten, tail is removed, so new body: [1] becomes new [0] position? Standard snake movement: when moving, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So for example, if I move to a new cell, head moves there, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, and tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So after move, if no food, snake length same, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If eat food, tail stays, new head added, so length increases.\n> \n> Now, for turn 16, possible actions: D to (3,4) or R to (4,5).\n> \n> I need to evaluate both options for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving R to (4,5).\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5) on turn 16:\n> \n> New head position: (4,5)\n> \n> New snake positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (2,4) is removed? No: the body segments: after head moves to (4,5), the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,5), then second to where first was (2,5), third to (1,5), fourth to (1,4), and since no food, tail (2,4) is not part of new body, so removed. Snake had 5 segments, after move no food, new snake: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ]? Let's list:\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (1,5), 3: (1,4), 4: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After move right to (4,5):\n> \n> New head: (4,5)\n> \n> Then new body:\n> \n> - Segment 1 (immediately after head) moves to old head position: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position: (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position: (1,4)\n> \n> And old tail (2,4) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> But old segment 3 was (1,4), which is now moved to by segment 4? Positions:\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: new position (4,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: old head position (3,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: old segment 1 position (2,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: old segment 2 position (1,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: old segment 3 position (1,4)\n> \n> Since there were 5 segments, and we add a new head, but no food, so we remove the tail, which was old segment 4 at (2,4). So new snake has segments: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). So tail is now at (1,4).\n> \n> (1,4) was previously segment 3, now it's the tail.\n> \n> And the cell (2,4) is now free.\n> \n> Direction: since moved right, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, from (4,5), possible moves: U (4,6), D (4,4), L (3,5), R (5,5).\n> \n> But L is reverse to current direction R? Current direction after move is R, so reverse is L, so cannot move L to (3,5) because that would be back, but (3,5) is now a body segment, so it's occupied anyway, so collision if try to move there.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (4,6): is it free? (4,6) is within bounds, not a border. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) not listed, so should be free. Not occupied by snake? New snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). (4,6) not there, so free.\n> \n> D to (4,4): (4,4) has food! Value 1, life span 10. But we didn't eat on this move, since we moved to (4,5), not (4,4).\n> \n> D to (4,4) is possible? From (4,5), D is down to (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is free? It has food, but food can be eaten if head moves there. But we are not moving there yet.\n> \n> For turn 17, from (4,5), we can move to (4,4).\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, back to turn 16 choice.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5), I'm closer to (4,4) food, which is at (4,4), life span 10, plenty of time.\n> \n> (4,4) is at (4,4), from (4,5), it's directly down, so I can move down to it on turn 17 if I want.\n> \n> But I need to think if it's safe.\n> \n> Now, other option: move D to (3,4) on turn 16.\n> \n> If move D to (3,4):\n> \n> New head: (3,4)\n> \n> New body: segment 1 to (3,5), segment 2 to (2,5), segment 3 to (1,5), segment 4 to (1,4)\n> \n> Tail (2,4) removed.\n> \n> New snake: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Tail at (1,4)\n> \n> Direction: moved down, so new direction D.\n> \n> From (3,4), possible moves: U (3,5), but (3,5) is now body segment, occupied, so collision if move there. Also, reverse direction? Current direction D, so up is reverse? Moving to (3,5) is up, which is opposite to down, so reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> L (2,4): (2,4) is now free? After move, (2,4) was tail and removed, so should be free unless something else.\n> \n> R (4,4): (4,4) has food, and is free.\n> \n> D (3,3): (3,3) within bounds, not obstacle, not occupied.\n> \n> So from (3,4), possible moves: L to (2,4) or R to (4,4) or D to (3,3).

Standard: when eat, head moves to food, and we don't remove the tail, so length increases by one.\n> \n> After eating: new positions: head at food cell, then the previous head, then previous body.\n> \n> So previous: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> After move to (4,4) and eat: new head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail still (1,4), but now it's segment 5, and length 6.\n> \n> Body segments: index 0: (4,4) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4) tail.\n> \n> Direction: moved down, so new direction D.\n> \n> Now, from (4,4), possible moves: U (4,5), but (4,5) is now body segment, occupied, and also reverse direction?

Snake has (4,5), (3,5), etc., not (5,5), so free.\n> \n> Left: (3,5) but (3,5) is the body segment, but since direction is R, I cannot move left anyway because of no reverse.\n> \n> But even if I could, moving to (3,5) would be body collision, except for the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,4), so (3,5) is not tail, it's the second segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4) tail.\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) would be moving to a body segment that is not the tail, so collision.\n> \n> But since I cannot move left, it's not an option.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - U: to (4,6)\n> \n> - D: to (4,4)\n> \n> - R: to (5,5)\n> \n> - L: not allowed.\n> \n> Now, (4,4) has food, which is positive.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, special case: food under body. Here, (4,4) is not under body; it's empty except for food.\n> \n> (4,4) is free cell with food.\n> \n> Now, if I move down to (4,4), I eat the food, snake grows to length 6, so new tail position... when I eat, the head moves to (4,4), and the tail stays or moves?\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So after eating, snake grows.\n> \n> Positions: if head moves to food, the body follows, but since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so new position: new head at food, body segments shift, tail remains where it was, and new segment added at tail? No.\n> \n> In snake game, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the head is now on that cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So positions become: new head at food, then previous head, then body, and tail stays.\n> \n> For example, current: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> If I move down to (4,4), which has food, I eat it. So new head at (4,4), then previous head (4,5) becomes first body, then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and tail (1,4) doesn't move, but since it grows, a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the snake grows immediately, so after moving to food, the head is at food, and the tail remains in place, so the snake has an extra segment.\n> \n> So positions: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and tail (1,4) still there? No.\n> \n> The segments: after move, head moves to (4,4), then the segment that was head becomes body, so (4,5) is now part of body, then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and tail (1,4). But since I ate food, I add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move, meaning (1,4) stays, and new segment is added after the tail? No.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, you don't remove the tail that turn, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So from positions: before move: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] length 5.\n> \n> After moving down to (4,4) and eating: head to (4,4), then the body is (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and tail (1,4) remains, so positions: [ (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] length 6.\n> \n> (1,4) is still tail, and (1,5) is now second last.\n> \n> If no food, tail moves off.\n> \n> But here with food, tail stays.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to empty cell, head moves, tail moves off.\n> \n> But in this case, (4,4) has food, so eating.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> Also, I need to consider Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (1,4), head at (4,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so (4,5) and (1,4) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = 3 + 1 = 4, not 1. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate options for turn 17.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Down to (4,4) - eat food immediately. Score +1, snake grows to length 6.\n> \n> Then positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> Direction: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n> \n> But I need to think future turns.\n> \n> Option 2: Move Right to (5,5) - no food there, so just move, no eat. Snake moves: head to (5,5), tail moves off (1,4), so positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] and (1,4) is gone. Tail was (1,4), after move, tail becomes (1,5)? Let's see: head moves to (5,5), then body segments: previous head (4,5) becomes first body, then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and tail (1,4) is removed, so positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] length 5, tail at (1,5).\n> \n> Direction now R, since moved right.\n> \n> Option 3: Move Up to (4,6) - no food, so move to (4,6), positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] tail (1,4) removed, so [ (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] tail at (1,5).\n> \n> Direction U.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5 turns ahead, so turns 17 to 22 or so.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (4,2) life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 19.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 6, by turn 22.\n> \n> (4,4) life span 9, by turn 25, but if I eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> Walls: all border x=0,7 y=0,7, but since grid is 1-6, only internal obstacles matter for movement.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So blocked: (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6)\n> \n> Free cells except snake and food.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Food at: (4,2), (6,6), (4,4)\n> \n> (4,4) is food, not occupied yet.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I want to eat all food, but need to survive.\n> \n> (4,2) is at y=2, x=4, life short, only 3 turns left.\n> \n> (6,6) at top-right, life longer.\n> \n> (4,4) is below head, easy to eat.\n> \n> But if I eat (4,4) now, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver later, but also, I get score.\n> \n> Since all food is +1, no negative food here, so all good to eat if possible.\n> \n> But I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake longer, harder to move.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the area.\n> \n> The snake is currently on the top row? y=5 and y=4.\n> \n> y=5: snake from x=1 to 4, but (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (1,4) tail.\n> \n> Below, at y=4, only (1,4) is snake, and (4,4) is food.\n> \n> Left side x=1, y=4 and y=5 occupied.\n> \n> Obstacles at (1,3) and (2,3), so row y=3 is blocked at x=1 and x=2.\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) blocked.\n> \n> Also (2,1) blocked, but far.\n> \n> (3,6) and (5,6) blocked at y=6.\n> \n> y=6 is top row, but (3,6) and (5,6) blocked, so only (4,6), (6,6) are free? x=1 to 6, y=6.\n> \n> (3,6) blocked, (5,6) blocked, so (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (6,6) free?

There are also internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n\n2. **Snake**: The snake's positions are given as [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)], with the head at (4,4) and the tail at (1,4). The head's current direction is \"D\" (down).\n\n3. **Food**: There are two pieces of food:\n   - (4,2) with value +1 and life span 2 (disappears after turn 20).\n   - (6,6) with value +1 and life span 5 (disappears after turn 23).\n\n### Goal\n\nMaximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the opposite move (Up, U) is not allowed in the next turn.\n\n**Current Position**: Head at (4,4), direction D.\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n1. **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n   - Check if (4,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n   - Check validity:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Part of the snake's body (second segment).\n   - Conclusion: Invalid (collision with body).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Food Options\n\nThere are two pieces of food:\n1. **(4,2)**: Life span 2 means it disappears after turn 20. It's two moves away (D to (4,3), then D to (4,2)).\n   - Can be eaten on turn 19.\n\n2. **(6,6)**: Life span 5 means it disappears after turn 23. It's four moves away (R to (5,4), R to (6,4), U to (6,5), U to (6,6)).\n   - Can be eaten on turn 21.\n\n### Step 3: Planning the Path to (4,2)\n\n**Turn 18**: Move D to (4,3).\n**Turn 19**: Move D to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\n**After Eating**:\n- The snake's length increases by 1.\n- New head at (4,2), body extends to include the previous tail.\n\n**Subsequent Moves**:\n- **Turn 20**: From (4,2), possible moves:\n  - D to (4,1): Valid but risky as it's near the bottom wall.\n  - L to (3,2): Valid.\n  - R to (5,2): Valid.\n- **Turn 21**: From (3,2) or (5,2), continue moving to open space.\n\n### Step 4: Planning the Path to (6,6)\n\n**Turn 18**: Move R to (5,4).\n**Turn 19**: Move R to (6,4).\n**Turn 20**: Move U to (6,5).\n**Turn 21**: Move U to (6,6) to eat the food.\n\n**After Eating**:\n- The snake's length increases by 1.\n- New head at (6,6), body extends.\n\n**Problem**:\n- From (6,6), the snake is trapped:\n  - U to (6,7): Wall.\n  - D to (6,5): Body segment.\n  - L to (5,6): Obstacle.\n  - R to (7,6): Wall.\n- No valid moves left → death.\n\n### Step 5: Comparing Both Options\n\n1. **Option 1: Eat (4,2)**\n   - Pros: +1 score, safe path.\n   - Cons: (6,6) is left uneaten, but it's a trap anyway.\n\n2. **Option 2: Eat (6,6)**\n   - Pros: +1 score.\n   - Cons: Leads to immediate death.\n\n**Conclusion**: Option 1 is better because it's safe and ensures survival.\n\n### Step 6: Finalizing the Action Sequence\n\nBased on the analysis, the best immediate action is to move Down (D) towards (4,2).\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n1. **Turn 18**: D → (4,3).\n2. **Turn 19**: D → (4,2) → eat food.\n3. **Turn 20**: L → (3,2).\n4. **Turn 21**: U → (3,3).\n5. **Turn 22**: U → (3,4).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats the food and then moves towards open space to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Turn 18**: Move D to (4,3). Valid.\n- **Turn 19**: Move D to (4,2). Valid and eat food.\n- **Turn 20**: Move L to (3,2). Valid.\n- **Turn 21**: Move U to (3,3). Valid.\n- **Turn 22**: Move U to (3,4). Valid.\n\nAll moves are safe and avoid collisions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the immediate action for Turn 18 is to move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) because moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would hit the wall.

Head direction is D, meaning down, so moving downwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 2. Life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including current, so after turn 18 and 19, it's gone by turn 20? Let's see: life span N, decreases every turn including current. So at turn 18, life span is 2, meaning:\n> \n> - Turn 18: present, life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 19: present, life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 20: gone, since after decreasing to 0.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) with value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1, so they increase length when eaten.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,4), direction down. So from (4,4), moving down would go to (4,3), but direction is down, so y decreases? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? The problem doesn't specify, but since head direction is down and positions: head (4,4), then (4,5) which is above if y increases upwards? Let's see snake positions: [(4,4), (4,5), ...]\n> \n> If head is at (4,4) and moving down, to (4,3) I assume? But the next segment is (4,5), which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, then (4,5) is above (4,4), so moving down from (4,4) would decrease y to (4,3).\n> \n> Confirming:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — so y+1 is up or down? The definition: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Or vice versa?\n> \n> The problem says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> It doesn't specify the coordinate system, but typically in such games, y=0 might be top or bottom. However, from snake positions: head (4,4), then (4,5). If head is moving down, from (4,4) to (4,3), but (4,5) is the next segment, which suggests that (4,5) is behind the head.\n> \n> Since head is at (4,4) and direction down, it was previously at (4,5)? Positions are given in order: head first, so [(4,4), (4,5), ...] means head is at (4,4), and the segment behind it is at (4,5). If direction is down, that means from (4,5) to (4,4), so moving down to (4,4), so y decreased.\n> \n> Therefore, moving down decreases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, head is at (x,y), and direction down, then at turn t+1, it moves to (x,y-1).\n> \n> Here, at turn 18, head at (4,4), direction down, so it came from (4,5) at turn 17? Positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]\n> \n> So the snake was at turn 17: head at (4,5), moving down to (4,4) at turn 18. Direction is given as current head direction, which is down, meaning it moved down to current position.\n> \n> For the next move, from (4,4), it can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Available moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U: up, to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by the body?

Positions: indices: 0: (4,4) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4) tail.\n> \n> So from (4,4), moving:\n> \n> - U: to (4,5) — this is occupied by segment 1, so collision, deadly.\n> \n> - D: to (4,3) — is this free?\n> \n> - L: to (3,4) — is this free?\n> \n> - R: to (5,4) — is this free?\n> \n> Also, need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,3) is within bounds? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x: 1 to 6, y:1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cannot move there. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (4,3): x=4, y=3, which is between 1 and 6, so ok.\n> \n> (3,4): x=3, y=4, ok.\n> \n> (5,4): x=5, y=4, ok.\n> \n> Now obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (4,3) is not an obstacle.\n> \n> (3,4) not obstacle.\n> \n> (5,4) not obstacle.\n> \n> But (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite direction instantly.

It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments at (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). So the snake is 6 units long. Head direction is Down, which is D. Since direction is D, moving down means increasing y? Let me confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). But in typical grid systems, y+1 might be up or down. Let's see: U is (x,y+1), which is up if y increases upwards, but in many games, y increases downwards. I need to be careful.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1) – if y+1 is up, then U is up. But in the state, snake positions: head at (4,3), direction D (down). From the positions, (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5), and (4,5) has higher y than (4,4), so if y increases as we go up, then moving from (4,4) to (4,5) is up, but direction is given as D? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)]. Head is (4,3), then next is (4,4), which has same x, y increased by 1. Then to (4,5), y increased by 1 again. So from head to body, y is increasing, but direction is D, which is down? That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> Perhaps I have the direction wrong. Head direction is D, meaning the snake is facing down. But if it's facing down, moving down should decrease y if y=0 is top. But in positions, from (4,3) to (4,4), y increased, so if y=0 is top, y=4 is down, so (4,4) is below (4,3) if y increases downward.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders.

But walls are y=0 and y=7, and it says \"border cells\", so likely y=0 is one edge, y=7 is opposite.\n> \n> I think I should look at the positions. Snake head at (4,3), body at (4,4), (4,5). If y=0 is top, then (4,3) is row 3, (4,4) row 4 below it, (4,5) row 5, so moving from head to tail, y increases, meaning the snake is moving downward? But head direction is D, which is down, so moving down to (4,4) from (4,3)? (4,3) to (4,4) is +y, which if y down, is moving down, but D is defined as (x,y-1), which is -y, up.\n> \n> Inconsistency.\n> \n> Let's read the movement constraints: \"U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`\"\n> \n> And head direction is D, meaning last move was down.\n> \n> From positions: from previous head, it must have been at (4,2) or something, but we don't have previous.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), ...] so the head is at (4,3), and the first body segment is at (4,4), which is directly below if y increases down. So the snake was moving down to reach (4,3) from above? But (4,3) is current head, so before that, head was at (4,2) if moving down, but (4,2) is not in positions; positions start from (4,3).\n> \n> The list is head first, so at some point, head moved to (4,3), and tail was at (4,4) or something.\n> \n> I think I need to think of the movement.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, head is at pos, then at t+1, head moves to new position.\n> \n> Direction is the current facing direction, so from head position, it can move in that direction or adjacent, but no instant reverse.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it is facing down, meaning if it moves down, it would go to (x,y-1) since D is (x,y-1)?

The available moves are U, D, or R (cannot reverse to L). \n\n1. **Move R to (6,3)**:\n   - Safe: No wall/body collision (tail is at (2,5), far away).\n   - Strategic: Positions the snake closer to the high-value food at (6,5), which has a long life span (9 turns). \n   - Avoids the risky (6,6) food, which could trap the snake after eating (head at (6,6) would have no escape).\n\n2. Alternatives:\n   - U to (5,4): Less direct path to food, same eventual outcome but slower.\n   - D to (5,2): Moves away from food, risking missing (6,6) before it expires.\n\nThus, **R is the optimal immediate action** to maximize score and survival.",

It's turn 20, and I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> The grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and these borders are walls. Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So, I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), then body segments at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is R, meaning it's moving right, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is left? Let me plot this.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), next is (4,3), which is left of head, so the snake is moving left? But head direction is given as R, which is right. That might be a mistake. Head direction is the direction it moved to get to the current head position. So from previous position to current head.\n> \n> Current head is at (5,3), and the direction is R, meaning it came from the left, so previous head was at (4,3)? But snake positions are [(5,3), (4,3), ...], so (5,3) is head, then (4,3) is the first body segment. So if head is at (5,3) and it moved right to get there, that means it was at (4,3) before and moved right to (5,3). But (4,3) is now the neck, I think. Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically in snake, the positions list has head first. So at turn t, head is at position 0, and it moved from position 1 to position 0 in the direction given.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: (5,3) head, index 1: (4,3), index 2: (4,4), index 3: (4,5), index 4: (3,5), index 5: (2,5). Head direction is R, meaning it moved right to reach (5,3), so from (4,3) to (5,3). So current movement direction is right.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive foods, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for (6,6), life span 4 at turn 20, so it will disappear after turn 23? Let's see: at turn 20, life span 4, so after 4 turns, it should be gone. Countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, then at turn t, countdown is L, turn t+1 it's L-1, ..., down to 0, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n> \n> For example, if life span is 4 at turn 20, then:\n> \n> - Turn 20: countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 21: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 22: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 23: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 24: countdown 0, disappears? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", so after 4 turns from turn 20, it would be gone at turn 24.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, countdown = L, then turn t+1: L-1, ..., turn t+L-1: 1, turn t+L: 0 and disappears. So it exists from turn t to turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For food at (6,6): position (6,6), value 1, life span 4 at turn 20. So it exists until turn 20 + 4 - 1 = turn 23? Turn t with life span L: present at turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1. Disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): life span 9, so from turn 20 to turn 20+9-1 = turn 28, disappears at turn 29.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake. Current head at (5,3), direction R (right). Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse: since current direction is R, I cannot move left (L) next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible actions from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: to (5,4)\n> \n> - D: to (5,2)\n> \n> - R: to (6,3)\n> \n> L is not possible because reverse.\n> \n> Now, I have to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So for possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,4): is this wall? x=5, y=4. Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=4 is not border. Internal obstacles: none at (5,4), so ok.\n> \n> - D to (5,2): y=2, not border, no internal obstacle, ok.\n> \n> - R to (6,3): x=6, y=3. x=7 is border, but x=6 is not x=7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,3) not listed, so should be ok.\n> \n> x=6, y=3: not in border or internal obstacles, so free.\n> \n> Now, body segments: snake positions: (5,3) head, (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> After move, the snake will move, so the tail will move away from (2,5), and head to new position.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it from the previous state.\n> \n> So after moving left:\n> \n> - Head was (6,3), moves to (5,3)\n> \n> - Then, the segment that was at (5,3) moves to where? It should move to the position that the head was at, but the head moved away. Actually, all body segments shift forward.\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,3)  // previous head position\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,3) // but (5,3) is now the head, conflict.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard: when the head moves to a new cell, the segment that was immediately behind the head moves to the old head position, and so on down the body.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position: (5,3)\n> \n> - Then, the first body segment (s1) moves to the old head position: (6,3)\n> \n> - Second body segment (s2) moves to the old position of s1: (5,3) but (5,3) is now the head? No, positions are changing.\n> \n> Old positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - s1: (5,3)\n> \n> - s2: (4,3)\n> \n> - s3: (4,4)\n> \n> - s4: (4,5)\n> \n> - Tail: (3,5)\n> \n> After head moves to (5,3):\n> \n> - New head: (5,3)\n> \n> - s1 moves to where head was: (6,3)\n> \n> - s2 moves to where s1 was: (5,3) but (5,3) is now occupied by new head? At this moment, the cell (5,3) is being vacated by s1, so it's free for the new head.\n> \n> The positions are updated simultaneously.\n> \n> So after move:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - s1: (6,3)  // from old head\n> \n> - s2: (5,3)  // from old s1 position? Old s1 was (5,3), but now it's moved to (6,3), so s2 moves to (5,3)? But (5,3) is the new head position, which is occupied.\n> \n> This is messy.\n> \n> I recall that in Snake, the body follows the head. When the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> For collision: when moving, the head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied by any body segment after the move, except the tail cell if it's moving away.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, for other body segments, if head moves to a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,3): (5,3) is currently occupied by s1, which is not the tail. The tail is at (3,5), so moving to (5,3) would be colliding with the body, which is deadly.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,3) is occupied by the first body segment, not the tail. So moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (6,2) or up to (6,4), but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current position (6,3) with head direction R.\n> \n> Possible directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> But cannot do instant reverse, which would be L, since current direction is R, reverse is L? No, reverse of R is L, but instant reverse is not allowed only on the next turn, meaning if I was moving R, I cannot immediately move L, but I can change to U or D.\n> \n> The constraint is: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from current direction R, I cannot move L for the next turn. But for turn 21, I can choose U, D, or R, but R is to (7,3), which is x=7, border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: to (6,4)\n> \n> - D: to (6,2)\n> \n> - L: to (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied by s1, and it's not the tail, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> - R: to (7,3) wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only U and D are possible? But L might be possible if it's the tail, but here (5,3) is not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5), far away.\n> \n> So moving to (5,3) would be into a body segment, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only U and D are safe moves.\n> \n> Confirming the grid:\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> (6,3): U to (6,4), D to (6,2)\n> \n> Now, check obstacles: internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). None at (6,4) or (6,2), so both should be free.\n> \n> (6,4) is not listed as obstacle, similarly (6,2).\n> \n> Food at (6,6) and (6,5), both on x=6.\n> \n> (6,6) and (6,5), so on the same column.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (6,6) has life span 3, so if not eaten by turn 23, it disappears. Current turn 21, so after turn 21, life span decreases by 1? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 21, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left including this one? Or after this turn?\n> \n> It says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for (6,6), life span 3 at turn 21: after turn 21, it goes to 2, after turn 22 to 1, after turn 23 it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 21, 22, or 23.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 8, so it has until turn 28 to be eaten.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 21: only U or D, since L and R are invalid.\n> \n> If I go U to (6,4), or D to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, I have to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks like getting trapped.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> So the snake is like: from (6,3) left to (5,3), then down? (5,3) to (4,3) is left, then (4,3) to (4,4) up, then (4,4) to (4,5) up, then (4,5) to (3,5) left, so tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, the area around: let's sketch a grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, walls on borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) are obstacles, so column x=1,2 y=3 blocked.\n> \n> (3,6) obstacle, (5,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) and (6,5).\n> \n> Now, from (6,3), if I go U to (6,4), that is one step closer to food at (6,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (6,5) is directly above at (6,4) then (6,5).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is at (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) has short life span.\n> \n> If I go D to (6,2), I go away from food.\n> \n> But going down might be safer or have other options.\n> \n> I need to survive and eat food.\n> \n> Also, consider the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (3,5), head at (6,3), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a side, so (6,3) and (3,5) are not adjacent; distance is large.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> Now, plan for 5 turns.\n> \n> First, for turn 21, I must choose U or D.\n> \n> Option 1: Go Up to (6,4)\n> \n> Then positions after turn 21:\n> \n> Head moves to (6,4)\n> \n> Then body: s1 to (6,3), s2 to (5,3), s3 to (4,3), s4 to (4,4), tail to (4,5)?

So next move, I can go Up, Left, or Right, but not Down.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, walls at borders, so cells outside x=0-7 or y=0-7 are invalid, but walls are given as borders, so I think only (0,0) to (7,7) are playable, with walls blocking outside.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,4) head, then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Food: (6,6), (6,5), (4,6)\n> \n> (6,6) life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 22, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 23? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1? Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 22, life span 2, so:\n> \n> - Turn 22: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 23: countdown 1 (still present)\n> \n> - Turn 24: countdown 0, disappears? Or after countdown reaches 0?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn\".\n> \n> Probably, countdown starts at life_span, decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, the food disappears. So for (6,6) at turn 22, life span 2, so:\n> \n> - Turn 22: countdown 2 (present)\n> \n> - Turn 23: countdown 1 (present)\n> \n> - Turn 24: countdown 0, disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 7, so will last until turn 28? Turn 22: countdown 7, turn 23:6, ..., turn 28: countdown 1, turn 29:0 disappear? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, countdown = L at turn t.\n> \n> After each turn, countdown decreases by 1.\n> \n> When countdown = 0, food disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,6): L=2 at t=22, so present at t=22 and t=23, disappears at t=24.\n> \n> For (6,5): L=7 at t=22, present from t=22 to t=28 (7 turns: 22,23,24,25,26,27,28), disappears at t=29.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): L=10, present from t=22 to t=31, disappears at t=32.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns, but since food has limited life, I should consider which food to target.\n> \n> First, let's see immediate options from head position (6,4).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (6,5)\n> \n> - Left: to (5,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (7,4), but x=7 is a border wall? Walls: x=0 or x=7 are walls, so (7,4) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0 or y=7 walls.\n> \n> So from (6,4):\n> \n> - Up: (6,5) - is this free? (6,5) has food, but let's check if it's occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — so (6,5) is not occupied by snake, and it has food (6,5,7,1), so it's a food cell.\n> \n> But moving to (6,5) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,4) — is (5,4) free? Snake: no snake at (5,4), obstacles: internal obstacles are (3,6),(2,1),(1,3),(2,3),(5,6), not (5,4). Walls: not border, so (5,4) should be free.\n> \n> - Right: to (7,4) — but x=7 is border wall, so invalid, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: to (6,3), but (6,3) is the second segment of snake, and also, moving down is instant reverse from Up, which is not allowed. So Down is invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: Up or Left.\n> \n> Now, if I go Up to (6,5), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, so snake grows, length increases by 1. After eating, the new head is at (6,5), and tail stays, so snake becomes: head (6,5), then previous head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), etc. So positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] — length 7 now.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> If I go Left to (5,4), no food there, so snake moves, head to (5,4), tail moves off (4,5)? Let's see.\n> \n> When no food eaten, snake moves: head to new position, tail segment is removed, so new positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — and (4,5) is removed, so length remains 6.\n> \n> Snake positions after move Left: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] — since tail was (4,5), it moves off, and (4,4) is now the tail? Positions: original: [ (6,4) head, (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail ]\n> \n> After move Left to (5,4): new head (5,4), then the body: the first body segment was (6,4), which is now behind head, so new positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — and (4,5) is removed, so now snake is [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] length 6.\n> \n> (4,4) is now the tail.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,6) which has short life, only 2 turns left including current, so it disappears after turn 23? At turn 22, life span 2, so present turn 22 and 23, gone at 24.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) has longer life, 7 turns.\n> \n> (4,6) has very long life, 10 turns.\n> \n> But (6,6) is about to disappear soon, so if I want to eat it, I need to get there quickly.\n> \n> From current position (6,4), if I go Up to (6,5), I am at (6,5) on turn 23? Turn 22: I move, so if I move Up on turn 22, head to (6,5), eat food there.\n> \n> Then on turn 23, I can move from (6,5).\n> \n> From (6,5), possible moves: Up to (6,6), Left to (5,5), Right to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid, Down to (6,4) but (6,4) is now body segment? After eating at (6,5), positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), etc.\n> \n> So from (6,5), moves:\n> \n> - Up to (6,6): which has food, and it's free? (6,6) is not snake body, not wall, so I can go there.\n> \n> - Left to (5,5): should be free, no snake or obstacle.\n> \n> - Down to (6,4): but (6,4) is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision, since head touches body. Deadly.\n> \n> - Right: invalid.\n> \n> So from (6,5), I can go Up or Left.\n> \n> If I go Up to (6,6) on turn 23, I eat that food too, since it's still present (life span, at turn 23, countdown 1 for (6,6), so present).\n> \n> Then I eat two foods in a row.\n> \n> But let's see the risk.\n> \n> There's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (6,5), tail is at (4,5)? After moving to (6,5) and eating, snake is: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Head at (6,5), tail at (4,5), not adjacent. (6,5) and (4,5) are not adjacent; distance in x and y.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (x,y) adjacent if |dx| + |dy| = 1.\n> \n> (6,5) and (4,5) have |dx|=2, |dy|=0, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Then if I go to (6,6) on turn 23, eat food, grow to length 8.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> First, if I go Left from (6,4) to (5,4) on turn 22.\n> \n> Then at (5,4), no food eaten.\n> \n> Then on turn 23, from (5,4), head direction would be Left? Last move was Left, so direction Left.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up to (5,5), Down to (5,3), Left to (4,4), Right to (6,4).\n> \n> But (5,3) is a body segment? Snake positions after turn 22 move Left: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — so (5,3) is body, (6,4) is body, (4,4) is tail? Positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> So from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up to (5,5): free? No snake, no obstacle.\n> \n> - Down to (5,3): (5,3) is body segment, so collision.\n> \n> - Left to (4,4): (4,4) is the tail segment, but moving to tail is allowed because when head moves to tail, tail will move away, so no collision, as long as it's only the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So Left to (4,4) is possible and safe, since tail moves.\n> \n> - Right to (6,4): (6,4) is body segment, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> So from (5,4), possible moves: Up to (5,5) or Left to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, (4,4) is currently tail, and if I move there, since no food, tail moves, so it's ok.\n> \n> But (4,4) might have food?

But internal obstacles also block cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (3,6): x=3,y=6\n> \n> (2,1): x=2,y=1\n> \n> (1,3): x=1,y=3\n> \n> (2,3): x=2,y=3\n> \n> (5,6): x=5,y=6\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (6,5)\n> \n> Body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail.\n> \n> (4,5) is the tail, and head is at (6,5), both at y=5, x=6 and x=4.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) and (4,6).\n> \n> (6,6) is directly above head? Head at (6,5), up would be (6,6), but there's an obstacle? (5,6) is an obstacle, but (6,6) is a different cell.\n> \n> (6,6) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) has food.\n> \n> But (5,6) is an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, so current movement is upwards.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) next. So possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) = (6,6)\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) = (5,5)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) = (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. x=7 is border wall, so cannot move right to (7,5).\n> \n> Similarly, down is opposite and not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Up to (6,6) or Left to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, (6,6) has food with value 1, life span 1.\n> \n> (5,5): what is there? Not occupied by snake or obstacle, I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (5,5) is not in snake, and obstacles are (3,6),(2,1),(1,3),(2,3),(5,6). (5,6) is obstacle, but (5,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) has food, but that's not adjacent to head directly.\n> \n> Head at (6,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (6,6) - has food, value 1\n> \n> - Down: (6,4) - but that's the body segment, and also opposite direction not allowed\n> \n> - Left: (5,5) - empty?\n> \n> - Right: (7,5) - wall, invalid\n> \n> So only two choices: Up to (6,6) or Left to (5,5).\n> \n> If I go up to (6,6), I eat the food. Value is +1, so snake length increases by 1, to 8 segments.\n> \n> But life span is 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. Since turn 23, and life span 1, it disappears after this turn, meaning if not eaten on turn 23, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,6), life span 1, disappears after turn 23 if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, if I eat (6,6), I move to (6,6), and since I eat, a new segment is added, so the tail stays where it is for now? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, meaning tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so tail stays, else tail moves away.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move without eating, head to new cell, each body segment shifts, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> After move with eating, head to new cell, body segments shift, but since growth, tail cell is not vacated, new tail is the old last body segment position? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: before move: head, seg1, seg2, ..., segN-1, tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: new head position, then old head, seg1, ..., segN-1, and tail position is vacated.\n> \n> After move with eating: new head position, then old head, seg1, ..., segN-1, and tail position remains occupied because of growth, so new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> In terms of list: positions [head, body1, body2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move to new cell without eating: new positions [new_head, old_head, body1, body2, ..., body_last] where body_last was the segment before tail, and tail cell is empty.\n> \n> After move to new cell with eating: [new_head, old_head, body1, body2, ..., tail] and tail position stays, so the list has one more element.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 7 segments: indices 0 to 6, head=0, tail=6.\n> \n> If move to (6,6) and eat, new head is (6,6), then body: old head (6,5) becomes segment after head, then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and tail was (4,5), but since eating, tail stays, so new positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] so tail now at (4,5), which was previous tail.\n> \n> (4,5) was tail, and it stays.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,6) is eaten.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,5), no food there, so snake moves: head to (5,5), then body: old head (6,5) becomes next, then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and tail (4,5) moves away, so (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] so tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about risks and future moves.\n> \n> Also, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,5), head at (6,5). Are they adjacent? (4,5) and (6,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so distance 1 in x or y. Here, x differs by 2, y same, so not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, both foods have life span 1, so they disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) can be eaten this turn by moving up.\n> \n> Food at (4,6) is not adjacent; head is at (6,5), (4,6) is two cells away: left and up or something.\n> \n> (6,5) to (4,6): delta x -2, delta y +1, so not adjacent.\n> \n> To reach (4,6), I need multiple moves.\n> \n> But since life span 1, if not eaten on turn 23, it's gone. So I can only eat it this turn if I were adjacent, but I'm not, so I cannot eat (4,6) this turn. It will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6), only if I move up this turn.\n> \n> Now, value of (4,6) is 9, which is high, but I can't reach it this turn. So it will be gone after turn 23.\n> \n> (6,6) has value 1, I can eat it by moving up.\n> \n> But should I? I need to think long-term.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving up to eat (6,6).\n> \n> After eating, positions as above: head at (6,6), body down to (6,5), (6,4), etc., tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, from (6,6), possible moves: current direction after move would be U, since I moved up.\n> \n> After moving up, head direction is U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,6): U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to U, which is D, so not D.\n> \n> U: (6,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> L: (5,6)\n> \n> R: (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: down to (6,5), but that's the body segment, and also opposite direction not allowed? After moving up, direction is U, so cannot move D next.\n> \n> So from (6,6), only possible move is Left to (5,6).\n> \n> But (5,6) is an internal obstacle! (5,6) is listed as internal obstacle.\n> \n> So (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,6), I can only move left to (5,6), but it's obstacle, so I die if I try to move there? Collision with wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Movement constraints: cannot move to wall or obstacle cells.\n> \n> So from (6,6), no valid moves? U to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, D not allowed (opposite and also (6,5) is body), L to (5,6) obstacle.\n> \n> So indeed, if I move to (6,6), I eat the food, but then on the next turn, I have no place to go, so I die.\n> \n> That's bad. Immediate death after eating.\n> \n> But on turn 23, I move to (6,6), eat, then on turn 24, I must move, but no possible moves, so collision or wall hit, game over.\n> \n> So moving up to (6,6) is suicide.\n> \n> Therefore, I should not do that.\n> \n> Only other choice is to move left to (5,5).\n> \n> Move left to (5,5), no food eaten.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) as tail.\n> \n> Tail was (4,5), but since no eat, it moved, so (4,5) vacated.\n> \n> Now, direction: I moved left, so new head direction is L (left).\n> \n> Food: (6,6) and (4,6) both disappear after this turn since life span 1 and not eaten on turn 23.

I think for this decision, I have to work with current state only, and since no food mentioned for future, I assume no food until it spawns, but I need to survive.\n> \n> But the goal is to maximize score, so I need to find food, but for now, no food, so I need to move safely.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Current position: head at (5,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction L, cannot move right (opposite).\n> \n> So possible: U, D, L.\n> \n> L: left to (4,5)\n> \n> U: up to (5,6)\n> \n> D: down to (5,4)\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> (4,5): is it free?

It's turn 25, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. So the inner grid where the snake can move is from (1,1) to (6,6). But there are also internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles are cells that are blocked, so I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So the snake has 7 segments. Head is at (5,4) and direction is down. Direction D means down, so moving downwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is 1.\n> \n> Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including current turn. So for (4,6), it will disappear after turn 25 + 8 - 1? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 25, life span is 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including this one. So it will be gone after turn 32? Let's calculate.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. For example, at turn t, life span N, it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is given as N at turn t, it means it has N turns left, so it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, life span N, after this turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears. So it exists for turns t to t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For food at (4,6): at turn 25, life span 8, so it will disappear at turn 25 + 8 = 33. Turn 33 it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 10, disappears at turn 25 + 10 = 35.\n> \n> But we need to think only a few turns ahead, like 5+ turns.\n> \n> Now, head direction is down, so current movement is downwards.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn.

Let's see.\n> \n> The positions are: head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So (5,3) is the sixth segment, not the tail. Tail is (4,3).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> But for collision, if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides. Because when the head moves, the tail also moves, so if head moves to the tail cell, it's ok only if the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves, so it doesn't occupy that cell anymore.\n> \n> But moving to any other body cell causes collision.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> From (5,4):\n> \n> - Down to (5,3): (5,3) is currently occupied by snake body.

So (4,4) not in list, so free.\n> \n> But is it a wall or obstacle? Walls: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7. (4,4) is x=4,y=4, not border. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (4,4) not in that list, so free.\n> \n> Right to (6,4): (6,4) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (6,4) is the fourth segment, not tail. Tail is (4,3).

Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,4), then body segments: (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3).

Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,5)\n> \n> - Down: (4,3)\n> \n> - Left: (3,4)\n> \n> - Right: (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> But I need to consider if moving to a cell causes collision.\n> \n> General rule: moving to a cell with a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment and the tail moves away.\n> \n> The tail segment is at (5,3). When the head moves, the tail also moves, so the cell that was tail becomes free, unless the head moves to it and the snake grows.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If I move to a cell:\n> \n> - If it's a wall, collision.\n> \n> - If it's a body segment, collision, except if it's the tail segment and the head moves to it only when eating food and growing, but that might cause collision if it's adjacent.\n> \n> There's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,3). Head is at (4,4), which is adjacent? (4,4) to (5,3): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent; adjacent means same x or same y, differing by 1.\n> \n> Adjacency: up, down, left, right, so same row or column, adjacent cells.\n> \n> (4,4) and (5,3): not same row or column, so not adjacent. Distance is sqrt(2), not adjacent in grid terms. Only orthogonal, not diagonal.\n> \n> So head (4,4) and tail (5,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,3)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,4)\n> \n> But (5,4) is occupied by the first body segment, which is not tail. Tail is (5,3), so (5,4) is a body segment. If I move right to (5,4), that's a collision because it's not the tail, and the tail is at (5,3), not moving to (5,4) yet.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at (5,4) will move to (4,4), and so on, tail moves away from (5,3).\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If I move to a cell with no food, snake doesn't grow, so tail moves away, and the cell that was tail is freed.\n> \n> - If I move to a cell with food, snake grows, so tail stays, new segment added.\n> \n> But collision: head collides if it moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, except if that body segment is the current tail and the head moves to it only when eating food, but due to growth, it collides.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Ah, important: I can move to the tail segment's cell because the tail will move away, so after move, it's not occupied.\n> \n> But only if it's the tail segment, and only if I'm not eating food there or something.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> And if I eat food at the tail cell, there's Tail Reward Danger if head was adjacent, but here not adjacent.\n> \n> For now, from (4,4), moving to cells:\n> \n> - (4,5): what is there? Not in snake positions except head and body. Snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So (4,5) is not occupied by snake. Is it a wall? Walls are borders and obstacles. (4,5): x=4, y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles: internal obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (4,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - (4,3): similarly, not in snake positions, not wall. Snake has (6,3) and (5,3), but (4,3) is free. Not obstacle.\n> \n> - (3,4): not in snake, not wall. Obstacles: (3,6) is at y=6, not y=4. (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> - (5,4): is occupied by the first body segment. But since it's not the tail, I cannot move there; it would be collision.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3), so (5,4) is a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (5,4) would cause collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> But according to rule, I can only move to tail segment safely.\n> \n> So from (4,4), possible safe moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4). R to (5,4) is invalid because collision.\n> \n> Now, also, cannot move opposite direction. Current direction is L, so moving R (right) is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So only U, D, L are possible for turn 26.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and plan ahead.\n> \n> Food at (4,6) and (2,2).\n> \n> (4,6) is above the head at (4,4), so (4,5) and (4,6) are above.\n> \n> (4,6) has life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 33 (26+7=33, but since life span decreases every turn including current, after turn 26, life span 7 means it has 7 turns left including this one, so it disappears at the end of turn 26 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 26, life span is 7, meaning after 7 turns, it disappears. After turn 26, countdown becomes 6; after turn 27, countdown 5; ... after turn 32, countdown 1; after turn 33, it disappears, so it is present from turn 26 to 32 inclusive? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 26, life span 7: after turn 26 (now), it has 7 turns left including this turn. After we process turn 26, countdown decreases to 6, so at start of turn 27, life span is 6. Similarly, at start of turn 33, life span would be 0, so it disappears before turn 33 or after? \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – but in state, it's given as current life span.\n> \n> At turn 26, food at (4,6) has life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns, so after turn 26+7=33, it is gone for turn 33 and beyond. So it can be eaten from turn 26 to turn 32 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 9, disappears after turn 26+9=35, so can be eaten from 26 to 34 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns, but the action sequence should be for immediate turns, starting from turn 26.\n> \n> The answer format says: Action Sequence for turns t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point, but it doesn't specify how many turns; it says \"in order\" and \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence for at least 5 turns or until a key decision.\n> \n> But since the grid is small, I can plan a path.\n> \n> First, let's find a way to get food safely.\n> \n> Food at (4,6): to reach it, I need to go up from (4,4) to (4,5), then to (4,6).\n> \n> But (4,6) might have issues?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (4,6), then the previous head position (4,5) becomes first body segment, then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and the tail (6,5) stays, so now 8 segments: head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> (6,5) was the last body before, and it stays because no tail movement.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, is (4,6) safe?

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and moving to any x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision.\n> - Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,3), then body segments: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). Let me list them in order:\n> - Head: (3,3)\n> - Segment 1: (3,4)\n> - Segment 2: (4,4)\n> - Segment 3: (5,4)\n> - Segment 4: (5,5)\n> - Segment 5: (6,5)\n> - Segment 6: (6,4)  // This should be the tail since it's last.\n> \n> The snake has 7 segments: positions from index 0 to 6.\n> \n> Snake head direction is \"D\", which means down. So the snake is moving downward, but the head is at (3,3), and moving down would be to (3,2), but let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, increasing y might be up or down. Here, it says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So:\n> - U: (x, y+1) — moving up increases y\n> - D: (x, y-1) — moving down decreases y\n> - L: (x-1, y)\n> - R: (x+1, y)\n> \n> So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? No, let's see the border: y=0 and y=7 are walls. But in terms of movement, D is (x,y-1), so decreasing y is down, meaning y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top? Actually, it doesn't specify the orientation, but for movement, D to (x,y-1) means if head is at (3,3), moving D would go to (3,2), which is below if we think y=0 as bottom.\n> \n> But in the snake positions, head is (3,3), and next segment is (3,4). Since the segments are listed head first, and the next one is (3,4), which has higher y, so if head was moving to (3,4) before, but direction is given as D, meaning down, which is decreasing y.\n> \n> There might be inconsistency. Head direction is D, down, so it should have come from a higher y. But let's see the positions: snake positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), ...] so head is (3,3), and the next segment is (3,4), which has y=4, higher than 3, so if y increases upward, then (3,4) is above (3,3), so if head is at (3,3) and was moving to it, but direction is given as current head direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, down. But the previous position must be where it came from. Positions are head first, so the head is at index 0, and the body follows. So at some point, the head moved to (3,3) from a previous position.\n> \n> Since direction is D, down, that means it moved down to (3,3). So from where? If it moved down to (3,3), it came from (3,4), because D is (x,y-1), so to reach (3,3) moving down, it must have been at (3,4) before. And indeed, the next segment is (3,4), which is the position behind the head. So that makes sense. The snake was at (3,4) and moved down to (3,3), so head is now at (3,3), direction down.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (6,4), and when the snake moves, the tail will move forward, so if head moves, the tail segment is left.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 7\n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive, since value is +1 for all, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so after turn 28, it has 5 turns left? Let's read: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t, with life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone, but it can be eaten up to turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns where countdown >0.\n> \n> For (4,6) at turn 28, life span 5, so countdown 5 at turn 28.

Other cells may be freed if the body moves, but since segments are connected, only the tail cell is freed when no growth.\n> \n> When no food is eaten, only the tail cell is freed; other body cells are still occupied but the segments move to new positions.\n> \n> For example, when head moves from A to B, segment 1 moves from C to A, segment 2 moves from D to C, etc., so the cell that was occupied by tail is freed, and the new head is at B, new positions.\n> \n> So in this case, for cell (4,4), it is currently occupied. After a move, the segment that was at (4,4) moves to a new position, so (4,4) is freed if no other segment moves to it, but since each segment moves to a specific cell, (4,4) will be empty after the segment leaves it, and no one moves to it because the segments move to the previous position.\n> \n> In the move, when segment i moves to the position where segment i-1 was, so the position where segment i was is left empty, except for the tail position, which is left empty.\n> \n> For any body segment, when it moves, its previous position is left empty, and it moves to the position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> But since the segments are moving, the cell is freed.\n> \n> Let's take an example.\n> \n> Current after turn 28 move to (4,3): positions: H: (4,3), B1: (3,3), B2: (3,4), B3: (4,4), B4: (5,4), B5: (5,5), T: (6,5)\n> \n> Cell (4,4) occupied by B3.\n> \n> Now, if I move head to (5,3), then:\n> \n> New H: (5,3)\n> \n> B1 moves to old H position: (4,3)\n> \n> B2 moves to old B1 position: (3,3)\n> \n> B3 moves to old B2 position: (3,4)\n> \n> B4 moves to old B3 position: (4,4)\n> \n> B5 moves to old B4 position: (5,4)\n> \n> T moves to old B5 position: (5,5)\n> \n> Old T position (6,5) freed.\n> \n> So now, B3 was at (4,4), moved to (3,4)\n> \n> B4 was at (5,4), moved to (4,4)\n> \n> So cell (4,4) is now occupied by B4, who moved from (5,4) to (4,4).\n> \n> So (4,4) is still occupied, by B4 now.\n> \n> Previously B3 was at (4,4), now B4 is at (4,4), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> The cell (4,4) is not freed; it's still part of the body, just a different segment.\n> \n> To free (4,4), the snake needs to move in a way that no segment is at (4,4), which requires that the segment that is there moves away and no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> In this case, since the body is connected, it's hard; (4,4) might be occupied for several turns until the tail passes or something.\n> \n> The position (4,4) will be occupied as long as there is a body segment there, which depends on the path.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head down or right, the body may shift, but (4,4) could remain occupied for a while.\n> \n> Specifically, in the current configuration, the segment at (4,4) is B3, which is 3 behind head.\n> \n> When the head moves, B3 moves to where B2 was.\n> \n> B2 is at (3,4), so if I move head, B3 will move to (3,4), so (4,4) is left, and then B4 moves to (4,4), so (4,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> If I move in a direction that the body moves away from (4,4), but it's difficult.\n> \n> For instance, if I move the head down to (4,2), then B3 might move to a different cell.\n> \n> After move to (4,3), if I move D to (4,2), then:\n> \n> New H: (4,2)\n> \n> B1 to (4,3)\n> \n> B2 to (3,3)  -- old B1 position\n> \n> B3 to (3,4)  -- old B2 position\n> \n> B4 to (4,4)  -- old B3 position\n> \n> B5 to (5,4)  -- old B4 position\n> \n> T to (5,5)  -- old B5 position\n> \n> Old T (6,5) freed.\n> \n> B3 moved to (3,4), so left (4,4), but B4 moved to (4,4), so (4,4) still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, only the tail cell is freed each turn when no growth.\n> \n> So to free (4,4), I need to have the tail be at (4,4) at some point, but the tail is currently at (6,5), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (4,4), and it may not go there.\n> \n> Therefore, (4,4) will be occupied for the foreseeable future, so I cannot go to (4,4) directly; I have to go around or wait for it to be free, but it might take too long for the food at (4,6) which has short life.\n> \n> (4,6) can only be accessed from (4,5), since (3,6) and (5,6) are obstacles.\n> \n> (4,5) is currently free, but to reach (4,5), from (3,3) or (4,3), I can go to (4,4) but it's occupied, or to (5,4) occupied, or to (3,4) occupied, so no direct way.\n> \n> I can go to (4,5) from other directions, like from (4,6) but that's the food, or from (5,5) or (3,5), etc.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3,y=5, not wall, not obstacle?

I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Typically in snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail position is freed.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to previous position of ahead, but the tail does not move, so the last position is not freed, and a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the tail stays, and the new segment becomes the new tail at the same position, so effectively, the snake grows by one, and the tail cell remains occupied.\n> \n> The new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, but since the tail doesn't move, it's the same.\n> \n> For example, before move, tail at T.\n> \n> After move with eat, head to new, body shifts, tail remains at T, and a new segment is added at T, so now there are two segments at T, but that can't be; it's the same cell.\n> \n> I think it's: after moving with eat, the snake has the new head position, the body positions shifted, and the tail position is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Better to think: the body segments include the old tail, and a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> So the positions are: new head, then the old head position becomes new body, and so on, up to the old tail position, and then a new segment at the old tail position, so the old tail position has two segments for a moment, but in practice, the new segment is added, so the tail is now at the old tail position, and it doesn't move.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the cell that was tail is still occupied by the new tail.\n> \n> For example, in this case:\n> \n> Turn 28 after move: snake positions: P0=(3,2), P1=(3,3), P2=(3,4), P3=(4,4), P4=(5,4), P5=(5,5), P6=(6,5)\n> \n> Tail at (6,5)\n> \n> Turn 29, move L to (2,2), eat food.\n> \n> New head: (2,2)\n> \n> Then, P1 moves to old P0: (3,2)\n> \n> P2 moves to old P1: (3,3)\n> \n> P3 moves to old P2: (3,4)\n> \n> P4 moves to old P3: (4,4)\n> \n> P5 moves to old P4: (5,4)\n> \n> P6 moves to old P5: (5,5)\n> \n> And since food eaten, a new segment is added at old P6 position: (6,5)\n> \n> So new snake: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)  -- 8 segments, tail at (6,5)\n> \n> Old P6 was (6,5), and new segment at (6,5), so tail is still (6,5), but it's the same cell, so it's fine.\n> \n> Positions are: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)  -- all distinct.\n> \n> (6,5) is tail.\n> \n> Direction: after moving left, new direction L.\n> \n> Now, (2,2) is at (2,2), which has obstacles nearby: (2,1) below is obstacle, (2,3) above is obstacle, so I can only move to (1,2) or (3,2), but (3,2) is now body, occupied.\n> \n> After move, positions: (2,2) head, (3,2) body, so (3,2) occupied.\n> \n> Also, (1,2) is free, (3,2) occupied, so only move to (1,2) left, or down to (2,1) but (2,1) obstacle, or up to (2,3) obstacle, so only possible move L to (1,2).\n> \n> Direction is L, so can move L, D, U, but D to (2,1) obstacle, U to (2,3) obstacle, R to (3,2) occupied, so only L to (1,2) possible.\n> \n> Then on turn 30, move L to (1,2).\n> \n> But (1,2) is not wall, x=1 not 0, y=2 not 0 or 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,3) is obstacle, but (1,2) not, so free.\n> \n> Move to (1,2), no food, so snake moves: head to (1,2), body shifts, tail (6,5) moves to old (5,5), so (5,5) becomes new tail, etc., but (6,5) freed.\n> \n> But I am at (1,2), which is cornered, with (1,3) obstacle above, (2,2) body behind, so I can only move down to (1,1) or left to (0,2) but x=0 wall, so only down to (1,1).\n> \n> (1,1) not obstacle, but (2,1) is obstacle, so (1,1) is free.\n> \n> Move to (1,1), then from there, only to (1,0) but y=0 wall, or up to (1,2) body, or right to (2,1) obstacle, so stuck, dead end.\n> \n> Oh, problem.

Snake positions: (4,3) head, then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), etc. So (4,4) is the fourth segment?

Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 29, life span 4, so it will disappear at the end of turn 32? Countdown: turn 29: countdown 4, after turn, countdown 3? Or at start of turn?\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's like: at the beginning of turn, if food has life span L, it decreases to L-1 during the turn, and if L-1=0, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves onto food during a turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> Standard: at turn t, food with life span L: if L >1, after turn, it becomes L-1.

On turn 32, if eaten, it should be before disappearance.\n> \n> I think it can be eaten as long as life span >0 when the head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 6, so available for 6 turns.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 9, available for 9 turns.\n> \n> Now, back to current position.\n> \n> Head at (4,3), moving right.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (4,2) or R to (5,3).\n> \n> If I move R to (5,3), new head position (5,3), tail moves from (6,5) to? After move, snake positions: head to (5,3), then body segments shift, so the new body is (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). Tail was (6,5), but after move, the segment that was at index 6 (tail) is removed or shifted? When snake moves, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: old positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)]\n> \n> After moving head to (5,3): new positions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).

Tail is (5,5), so (4,3) is body, collision.\n> \n> But can I move to tail? Only if the head moves to the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,3), moving L to (4,3): (4,3) is the position that will be occupied by index 1 after the move? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is the current tail position, and we don't eat, then the tail moves, so it's safe because the tail vacates.\n> \n> But here, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is (5,5).\n> \n> In the new positions after move, (4,3) is part of the body, not tail.\n> \n> So moving to (4,3) would cause collision since head touches body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is occupied.\n> \n> Now (5,2): is it free? y=2, x=5, within 1-6, not in snake or obstacles, so free.\n> \n> (6,3): x=6, y=3, walls at x=7, so x=6 is ok, not wall.

It's turn 31. The grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include borders and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then body segments: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4).

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 31, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 32 if not eaten? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will be present until turn T + L - 1, and disappear at turn T + L. For example, life span 2 at turn 31: it will be there on turn 31 and 32, and disappear after turn 32 or at turn 33? Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so if N=2, it disappears after 2 turns, so on turn 33 it's gone. But let's see the countdown.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 31, life span is 2; after turn 31, countdown becomes 1; after turn 32, countdown 0, so it disappears before turn 33? I think I need to be precise.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so when we are at turn T, and food has life span L, at the start of turn T, life span is L. After the snake moves on turn T, the life span decreases to L-1 for the next turn. Then on turn T+1, it decreases to L-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and the food disappears before the next turn or something. But for eating, it can be eaten on any turn as long as life span >0.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,6): life span 2 at turn 31, so it can be eaten on turn 31 or 32, and disappears after turn 32.\n> \n> (2,2): life span 4, can be eaten on turns 31,32,33,34, disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> (6,2): life span 7, eaten turns 31-37.\n> \n> (6,1): life span 10, eaten turns 31-40.\n> \n> All food has value 1, positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Current direction R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L on next turn. So possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't move there. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake body: positions [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> So let's sketch the grid.

prioritizing long-term survival and flexibility to consume the high-life-span food at (6,2) and (6,1) later. The food at (4,6) and (2,2) is unreachable within their life spans due to distance and obstacles, so the sequence focuses on safe navigation to open areas for future scoring.\n",

So, I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> **Snake Positions:** Head is at (6,4), then body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,4)\n> \n> The snake has 7 segments.

No negative food mentioned. Life_span: for (4,6), life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.

If I eat it on turn 32, great. If not, after turn 32, life_span becomes 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) has life_span=3, so it will be there for turns 32,33,34, and disappear after turn 34 if not eaten.\n> \n> Life_span decreases at the end of the turn, I think. The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at the start of turn 32, for (4,6), life_span=1.

So I can move U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move down on this turn.\n> \n> Possible actions on turn 32: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does.\n> \n> First, if I move U: from (6,4) to (6,5). Is that safe?\n> \n> (6,5): is it a wall? Borders: y=7 is wall, y=5 is not border. x=6, not border. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), etc., (6,5) not listed, so not obstacle. Snake body: current positions are (6,3),(5,3), etc., (6,5) is empty. So (6,5) is free. Moving to (6,5) is safe for now.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake grows only if I eat food. If I don't eat, tail moves, so positions update.\n> \n> Similarly, move L: from (6,4) to (5,4). (5,4): not wall, not obstacle, not snake body? Body has (5,3), (4,4), etc. (5,4) is not occupied, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). So (5,4) is empty. Yes.\n> \n> Move R: from (6,4) to (7,4). x=7 is border wall, so (7,4) is wall, cannot move there. Invalid.\n> \n> So on turn 32, possible moves: U or L (since R is wall, D is reverse, not allowed).\n> \n> U: to (6,5)\n> \n> L: to (5,4)\n> \n> Now, I need to consider food.\n> \n> There's food at (4,6) with life_span 1, so I must eat it now or lose it.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n> \n> Can I reach it this turn? From (6,4) to (4,6) in one move? No, I can only move one cell per turn.\n> \n> So I cannot eat it this turn directly; it's two cells away.\n> \n> But I need to plan to eat it if possible, but with life_span 1, if I don't eat it this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Current turn 32, I can only move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> From (6,4), I can go to (6,5) or (5,4), neither is (4,6), so I cannot eat (4,6) on turn 32. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> (4,6) has life_span 1, and I can't reach it now, so it will be gone. No point in considering it.\n> \n> So food at (4,6) is not achievable; ignore it.\n> \n> Now other food:\n> \n> (2,2) with life_span 3, so available for turns 32,33,34.\n> \n> (6,2) with life_span 6, available turns 32 to 37.\n> \n> (6,1) with life_span 9, available longer.\n> \n> Head at (6,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (6,5), I'm going away from the food below.\n> \n> If I move L to (5,4), I'm closer to the left side.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the tail and possible collisions.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4), and it will move when I move, depending on if I eat or not.\n> \n> Since I don't eat food this turn, when I move, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> So after turn 32:\n> \n> If I move U to (6,5), new head (6,5), body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (4,4) moves away?

Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (6,4), tail at (4,4), not adjacent; (5,4) is between, but empty. Distance: x diff 2, y same, so not adjacent.

It's turn 33, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since walls occupy these, the snake can only be on cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, the border cells are walls, so cells like (0,0) to (7,7) exist, but (0,y), (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. So the snake can be on (1,1) to (6,6), I believe.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)]. So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (5,4) from previous position.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,2) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for (2,2), life span 3 at turn 33. After turn 33, life span becomes 2, then turn 34 it becomes 1, turn 35 it becomes 0 and disappears? Or does it disappear when life span reaches 0?\n> \n> Let me read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". I think after N turns from now, it disappears. So for (2,2) at turn 33 with life span 3, it will be there for turns 33, 34, 35, and disappear at the start of turn 36? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, life span is N, it can be eaten on turn t if head moves there, then at turn t+1, if not eaten, life span becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on the turn it's spawned, life span decreases immediately? But for food that is present, at the current turn, life span is given, and it decreases each turn.\n> \n> For (2,2) at turn 33, life span 3. So on turn 33, it can be eaten, and after turn 33, if not eaten, life span becomes 2 for turn 34, and so on. After turn 35, life span becomes 0, and it disappears before turn 36. So it can be eaten on turns 33, 34, or 35.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 5, can be eaten turns 33 to 37.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 8, turns 33 to 40.\n> \n> All food is positive, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,4), direction L, so it came from (6,4) to (5,4) moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head direction is L, it can move L, U, or D, but not R because of no instant reverse.

Positions: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,4). So (5,3) is position 3, which is body.\n> \n> But can I move to (5,3)?

Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 34, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 35? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (2,2) with life span 2 at turn 34: after turn 34, life span becomes 1; after turn 35, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 34 or 35, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (6,2) value 1, life span 4: can be eaten until turn 37 (since 34,35,36,37? Life span 4 at turn 34: after 34, 3; 35, 2; 36, 1; 37, 0 gone. So available turns 34,35,36.\n> \n> - (6,1) value 1, life span 7: available longer.\n> \n> - (3,5) value 1, life span 10: available even longer.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? Value is given as 1 for all, and no negative food mentioned. Let me check: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (2,2,2,1) – I think the format is (x,y, life_span, value). In the input it says: \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the list it's written as (2,2,2,1) which might be confusing.\n> \n> Looking back: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2,2,2,1)\" – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly for others. So:\n> \n> - (2,2): life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2): life_span=4, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1): life_span=7, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,5): life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Good.\n> \n> Snake is at: head (4,4), direction L (left). So current direction is left, meaning it came from right? Snake positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), ...] so head at (4,4), next is (5,4), so it moved from (5,4) to (4,4), so direction left. Yes.\n> \n> Now, the grid size: from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake body: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Tail is (3,3).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,4) with direction L (left). Since direction is L, I cannot move right (R) next turn because of no instant reverse rule. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,4)\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,5) – is this valid? Check walls and body.\n> \n> Walls: border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (4,5) not listed. Obstacles are: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So (4,5) is free? But snake body might be there.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) – so (4,5) is not occupied by snake. Similarly, not wall. So (4,5) is free.\n> \n> - Down: (4,3) – but (4,3) is part of snake body. Is it the tail? Tail is (3,3), and (4,3) is the second last? Positions: index 0: (4,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (3,3) tail. So (4,3) is position 5, body segment, not tail. If I move down to (4,3), it's a body collision, since it's not the tail that will move away. The tail is (3,3), which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated. But for collision, head cannot touch any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because the tail will move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, (4,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment. Tail is (3,3). So moving to (4,3) would cause collision because it's a body part that won't move away immediately; only the tail can be moved into safely.\n> \n> Similarly, left: (3,4) – is this free? x=3,y=4. Walls: not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (3,6) etc., not (3,4)). Snake: not in positions, so free.\n> \n> Right: (5,4) – but (5,4) is the second position, body segment. Also, since current direction is L, moving right is reverse, which is not allowed. So cannot move right.\n> \n> So from (4,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,5) – free, no issue\n> \n> - D: to (4,3) – occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (3,4) – free, valid\n> \n> - R: to (5,4) – occupied by body and reverse direction, invalid\n> \n> So only U or L are possible without immediate death.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 35 (since at turn 34, life span 2, after turn 34: life span 1, after turn 35: gone). So can be eaten on turn 34 or 35.\n> \n> - (6,2): life span 4, available turns 34,35,36,37\n> \n> - (6,1): life span 7, available longer\n> \n> - (3,5): life span 10, available longer\n> \n> All value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and snake grows.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, consider the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. For example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7).\n> \n> - Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake occupies: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Food at: (2,2), (6,2), (6,1), (3,5)\n> \n> Now, from head (4,4), I can go U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n> \n> If I go L to (3,4), that might be towards food (2,2) or (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is food, but (3,5) is at y=5, x=3.\n> \n> (3,4) to (3,5) is up, but (3,5) is food, but is there an obstacle? (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) should be free except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go U to (4,5), that might be towards (3,5) or other.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple steps.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (3,3), and if I move, the tail will move to the next position? When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, since I might eat food, length changes.\n> \n> But for now, let's consider paths.\n> \n> First, let's find a safe path to eat food.\n> \n> Food (2,2) is about to expire; life span 2, so must eat soon if possible.\n> \n> Distance from head (4,4) to (2,2): |4-2| + |4-2| = 2+2=4 Manhattan, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Direct path: (4,4) to (3,4) to (2,4) but (2,4) might be free? But then to (2,3) or (2,2)? (2,3) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle (2,3) is listed, so (2,3) is blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (2,3) is one, so (2,3) is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) and (2,1) etc.\n> \n> So from (4,4) to (2,2):\n> \n> - Cannot go directly left because (2,3) is blocked.\n> \n> Possible path: (4,4) to (3,4) – free\n> \n> Then from (3,4), can go to (3,3)? But (3,3) is current tail, but when I move to (3,4), the snake moves, so tail moves from (3,3) to where? After move, positions change.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current turn 34, head at (4,4), direction L.\n> \n> Suppose I move L to (3,4).\n> \n> New head position: (3,4)\n> \n> Then the body follows: the segment that was at (5,4) moves to (4,4), (6,4) to (5,4), (6,3) to (6,4)? Positions: after moving head to (3,4), the body segments shift: the second segment moves to where head was, (4,4), then third to where second was, (5,4), and so on, tail moves to where the last body was.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4), new positions: head (3,4), then body: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) – tail was (3,3), which is removed, and new tail is (4,3)?

Let me check.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall.

So from head, moving down would be to (3,2), but let's list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,4) – since head is moving down, and previous position was up, but positions are given in order, so (3,3) is head, then (3,4) is next, which is above, so snake was moving down to (3,3), so from (3,4) to (3,3) is down, so direction is down, meaning next move could be to (3,2) if possible.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, and positions are head first: (3,3), then (3,4), which is north of head? Let's think coordinates.\n> \n> Assume (x,y), with (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? Usually in such games, (0,0) is top-left, but direction U is (x,y+1), which might be down if y increases downward, or up if y increases upward.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> In standard grid, if (0,0) is top-left, then U (y+1) would be down, D (y-1) up? That seems counterintuitive.\n> \n> Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in programming, for 2D grids, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, so U (up) would decrease y, D (down) would increase y. But here, U is defined as (x,y+1), which if y increases downward, y+1 is down, so U would be down? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps y increases upward? But that's less common.\n> \n> Let's read the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So if U is up, then y+1 should be increasing y when moving up, so probably y=0 is bottom, y increases upward.\n> \n> In many games, it varies, but to avoid confusion, let's look at the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Head at (3,3), next segment at (3,4). Since head direction is D (down), and down is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> From (3,4) to (3,3), y decreased from 4 to 3, so that is down. So y=3 is below y=4. Therefore, y increases as we go up, so (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume. Or top-left with y increasing down? Let's see.\n> \n> If from (3,4) to (3,3), y from 4 to 3, and it's moving down, so decreasing y.

(5,3) is the last segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), tail (5,3)\n> \n> So the tail is at (5,3), and head at (3,3), so they are not adjacent; (3,3) to (5,3) is two cells away in x, same y.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,3) adjacent to (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3), etc.\n> \n> (5,3) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's two steps away.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,2), which is below (6,3) and left of (6,4)? (6,4) is body, (6,3) is body, (6,2) is food.\n> \n> If head moves to (6,2), it eats food, snake grows, so new tail is added, but since it grows, the tail doesn't move immediately; when you eat, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move that turn, and new position is head moved, and body follows, but tail stays put.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after moving to food, the new head is at food cell, and the body includes the previous head, etc.\n> \n> But for tail, if head moves to a cell adjacent to tail, and that cell has food, but the tail will move or not depending.\n> \n> Special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Here, at (6,2), is it adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,3). (5,3) and (6,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonal? Adjacent means up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (6,2) adjacent cells: (6,1) down, (6,3) up, (5,2) left, (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so (5,2) and (6,3), (6,1).\n> \n> (6,3) is body segment, (5,3) is tail, which is at (5,3), not (5,2) or (6,3) directly adjacent to (6,2).\n> \n> (6,2) has neighbors: (6,1), (6,3), (5,2), (7,2) wall.\n> \n> (5,3) is at (5,3), which is not a neighbor of (6,2); neighbors are (5,2) and (6,3), etc.\n> \n> (6,3) is a body segment, not the tail.

Therefore, eating (6,2) should be safe, no tail reward danger.\n> \n> Similarly, for other food.\n> \n> Now, to eat (6,2), head needs to move to (6,2).\n> \n> From current position (3,3), I can go R to (4,3), then from there, possible moves to get to (6,2).\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), new head position (4,3), direction R.\n> \n> Then from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (4,4) – but (4,4) is body, occupied.\n> \n> D to (4,2) – down, y-1 to (4,2). Is it free? Walls: no. Obstacles: no. Body: snake has positions, (4,2) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> L to (3,3) – but (3,3) is now the neck, since head moved to (4,3), so (3,3) is part of body, so moving L to (3,3) would collide with body.\n> \n> R to (5,3) – (5,3) is tail? After move, the tail might move, but let's see.\n> \n> When head moves to (4,3), the body moves: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> At turn start: positions [head: (3,3), seg1: (3,4), seg2: (4,4), seg3: (5,4), seg4: (6,4), seg5: (6,3), tail: (5,3)]\n> \n> If head moves to (4,3), then new positions: head at (4,3), then seg1 moves to previous head position (3,3), but (3,3) is now head new position? No.\n> \n> After move: head is at new position, then the first body segment moves to where head was, second to where first was, and so on, tail to where second last was.\n> \n> So initial: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,3): new head at (4,3). Then body: seg1 (was at (3,4)) moves to where head was, (3,3). But (3,3) is now occupied? No, head moved, so (3,3) is free for seg1 to move to.\n> \n> Then seg2 (was at (4,4)) moves to where seg1 was, (3,4).\n> \n> Seg3 (was (5,4)) moves to where seg2 was, (4,4).\n> \n> Seg4 (was (6,4)) moves to where seg3 was, (5,4).\n> \n> Seg5 (was (6,3)) moves to where seg4 was, (6,4)? Seg4 was at (6,4), but seg4 moves to (5,4), so where seg4 was is now for seg5.\n> \n> Seg5 was at (6,3), moves to where seg4 was, which is (6,4).\n> \n> Then tail seg6 was at (5,3), moves to where seg5 was, which is (6,3).\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) — and tail at (6,3)? Seg6 moved to (6,3), but (6,3) was where seg5 was.\n> \n> List: new snake: head at (4,3), then body: position 1: (3,3) [previous head], position 2: (3,4) [previous seg1], position 3: (4,4) [previous seg2], position 4: (5,4) [previous seg3], position 5: (6,4) [previous seg4], position 6: (6,3) [previous seg5], and the tail was previous seg6 at (5,3), but it moves to where previous seg5 was, which is (6,3), but (6,3) is now occupied by position 6?

It's turn 37, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's 8x8? No, x=0 to x=7 means 8 cells in width, but typically we consider the playable area. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and moving to those coordinates is a wall collision.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So I need to avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,2), then body segments at (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up? U is (x,y+1), so if y+1, that means higher y is up, I think. But let's confirm with the positions.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,2), direction D, which is down, so moving to (x,y-1). From (3,2) moving down would go to (3,1), but let's see the positions: after head (3,2), next is (3,3), which has higher y, so if head is at (3,2) and body at (3,3), that means the snake is moving upwards? I'm confused.\n> \n> List the positions in order: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). So from head (3,2) to (3,3), that's an increase in y, so moving up. But head direction is given as D, which is down. That can't be right.\n> \n> Head direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" – D for down. But if the snake is moving down, from where? The positions show head at (3,2), then next segment at (3,3), which is above it if y increases upwards. So (3,2) to (3,3) is moving up, but direction is down? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps y=0 is the bottom, so y increases upwards. U is (x,y+1) meaning up, D is (x,y-1) meaning down. So (3,2) to (3,3) is moving up, but the head direction is given as D, down. That doesn't match.\n> \n> Current head position is (3,2), and the segment behind it is (3,3). Since the head is first, and body follows, so the head is moving away from the body. If body is at (3,3), and head at (3,2), that means the head was at (3,3) and moved to (3,2), so it moved down to (3,2). Direction D means it was moving down to get to (3,2). Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> So at turn 37, the snake just moved to (3,2) by moving down from (3,3)? Positions: snake positions are listed as [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), ...], so (3,2) is head, (3,3) is the first body segment. So the snake moved to (3,2) from previous position, which must have been above, so it moved down to (3,2). Therefore, head direction is D, down, meaning it is facing down, so it can move down, left, or right, but not up because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so cannot move U (up) on this turn. Possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But D would be to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,2), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Turn t1=37, so for (6,2), life span 2, it will disappear after turn 38? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 37, countdown is 2, meaning after turn 37, it decreases to 1, then after turn 38, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 4: countdown 4 at turn 37, decreases to 3 after turn 37, to 2 after 38, etc., disappears after turn 40? After N turns from now.\n> \n> Life span N means it will disappear after N turns, including the current one? The rule: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, after turn t, countdown becomes L-1; after turn t+1, L-2; ... after turn t + (L-1), countdown becomes 0, and it disappears, so it can be eaten up to and including turn t + (L-1). For example, life span 2 at turn 37: after turn 37, countdown=1; after turn 38, countdown=0 and disappears. So it exists on turn 37 and 38, can be eaten on those turns.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 4: exists on turns 37,38,39,40; disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake.

No: the tail position before move is (4,4), and it stays, and a new segment is added, so the positions become: [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ] and the new segment is at (4,4), but that would be duplicate? No, I think I have mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail leaves last cell.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, tail does not leave, new segment added at tail, so the tail cell remains occupied, and length increases.\n> \n> In this case, before move turn 40, positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ] so head (5,1), tail (4,4)\n> \n> Move to (6,1) and eat: head now (6,1), the body segments: (5,1) becomes first body, (4,1) second, (4,2) third, (3,2) fourth, (3,3) fifth, (3,4) sixth, (4,4) seventh, and add new eighth segment at the previous tail position, which is (4,4), so now (4,4) has two segments? No.\n> \n> The segments: the new head is (6,1), then the previous head (5,1) is now first body, then (4,1) second body, (4,2) third, (3,2) fourth, (3,3) fifth, (3,4) sixth, and the previous tail (4,4) is now seventh body, and a new segment is added at (4,4), so it becomes eighth segment at (4,4), but that means (4,4) is occupied twice? I think I confused.\n> \n> Actually, when eating, the tail does not move, so the previous tail position remains, and a new segment is added there, but since the tail was at (4,4), it stays, and a new cell is added at (4,4), so it's the same cell, but it's one segment.\n> \n> The list should be: after move, the positions are: new head at (6,1), then the entire previous body in order, and since growth, the last segment is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Better: the snake body includes all previous segments, and the tail segment stays, so the position (4,4) is still occupied by the same segment, and a new segment is added at that position? No.\n> \n> Standard: the new snake has the head at the new position, followed by all the previous positions except the tail is not removed, so the previous tail position is still part of the body, and a new segment is added at that position, meaning the tail doesn't advance, so the length increases by one, with the new segment at the old tail position.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell that was tail remains occupied, and no new cell is vacated.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, head at (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — and the (4,4) is still there, so it's 8 segments: indices 0: (6,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,4), 7: (4,4)\n> \n> Yes, tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, back to action sequence.\n> \n> For turn 41: head at (6,1), direction R (since moved right to it), can move U, D, R, but D and R invalid, L to (5,1) body, so only U to (6,2).\n> \n> Move U to (6,2)\n> \n> Then positions: no food, so head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail (4,4) vacated?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1 or something?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases by one. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Example: food with life span 1 at turn t: at turn t, countdown=1, if not eaten during turn t, after turn t, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 3 at turn t: countdown=3, after turn t, countdown=2, after turn t+1, countdown=1, after turn t+2, if not eaten, disappears before turn t+3.\n> \n> Standard: at the start of turn, food is present if countdown > 0. When head moves to it during the turn, it is eaten. After the turn, countdown decreases.\n> \n> But in the description: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: for food at turn t with life span L, it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1, and after turn t+L-1, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,2) at turn 38, life span 1: can be eaten only during turn 38, not later.\n> \n> But as above, I can't reach it on turn 38, so it will disappear.\n> \n> For (6,1): life span 3, so can be eaten during turn 38, 39, or 40.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): life span 6, turns 38 to 43.\n> \n> (5,3): life span 9, turns 38 to 46.\n> \n> Now, back to moves for turn 38.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R (since L is opposite, not allowed).\n> \n> Move to:\n> - U: (4,3)\n> - D: (4,1)\n> - R: (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are safe, i.e., not wall and not body except tail.\n> \n> (4,3): not wall, not in body positions. Body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). (4,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (4,1): not wall, not obstacle, not in body. Body at y=2,4, not y=1. Obstacle at (2,1), but (4,1) different.\n> \n> (5,2): not wall, not in body. Body has (5,4) but y=4.\n> \n> All seem safe.\n> \n> Now, food: no food at (4,3), (4,1), or (5,2). Food is at (6,2), (6,1), (3,5), (5,3). None at these positions.\n> \n> So moving to any of these won't eat food immediately.\n> \n> I need to think ahead to plan for food and avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,4). Currently, head is at (4,2), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent would be same x or y diff 1.\n> \n> (4,2) to (6,4): delta x=2, delta y=2, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> But if I move towards tail, might become adjacent.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid with obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x.\n> \n> So cells: (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) — but (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) are corners.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Now, snake: head (4,2), body segments.\n> \n> I need to find a path to eat food safely.\n> \n> Available food: (6,1) at y=1, near bottom; (3,5) at top; (5,3) near center.\n> \n> (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, which might be accessible.\n> \n> Also, (6,1) is below.\n> \n> But head at (4,2), so (5,3) is one step up-right? From (4,2) to (5,3) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,3), (5,2), etc.\n> \n> To reach (5,3): from (4,2), I can go to (5,2) or (4,3), then to (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Option 1: Move right to (5,2) on turn 38.\n> \n> Then at (5,2), head direction was R, so now direction R, can move U, D, R (not L).\n> \n> From (5,2), possible moves:\n> - U to (5,3) — there is food at (5,3)!

Eat it, snake grows to 8 segments.\n> \n> After eating, length increases, so tail doesn't move that turn? No, in Snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to food cell, it eats, and the tail doesn't move, so new segment added at head position, effectively the tail stays put.\n> \n> But positions: when moving, head moves to new cell, if food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows. Else, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,3) on turn 39, I eat the food there.\n> \n> But let's sequence.\n> \n> Also, need to check if moving to (5,3) is safe.\n> \n> At turn 39, if I move to (5,3), what are positions.\n> \n> First, turn 38: move R to (5,2). Head to (5,2), body: previous head (4,2) becomes new body segment, so snake positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) — tail still (6,4), but since no food eaten, tail should move? Let's clarify movement.\n> \n> Standard Snake movement: each turn, head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the last segment (tail) is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at head, net increase in length.\n> \n> If not, tail moves away.\n> \n> So for turn 38: move head to (5,2). Since no food at (5,2), tail moves: the segment at (6,4) is removed, so new tail is (5,4)? Positions: after move, head at (5,2), then body: the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,2), so (4,2) is now part of body, then (3,2) to (3,2)? Let's list.\n> \n> Initial positions: head (4,2), body: segment 1: (3,2), seg2: (3,3), seg3: (3,4), seg4: (4,4), seg5: (5,4), seg6: (6,4) — tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,2): new head (5,2). Then body segments: seg1 moves to where head was, (4,2); seg2 moves to where seg1 was, (3,2); seg3 to where seg2 was, (3,3); seg4 to where seg3 was, (3,4); seg5 to where seg4 was, (4,4); seg6 to where seg5 was, (5,4). And since no food, tail (6,4) is removed, so the new tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> New positions: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) — tail at (5,4).\n> \n> (6,4) is gone.\n> \n> Now turn 39: head at (5,2), direction from previous move was to (5,2) from (4,2), so direction R (since x increased).\n> \n> Now, I can move U to (5,3), D to (5,1), or R to (6,2).\n> \n> (5,3) has food, so if I move U to (5,3), I eat the food.

It's turn 39, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? The walls are defined by border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls occupy those, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall and can't be moved to. Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these are also walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which makes sense since it's moving from (4,1) to (4,2) next? Positions are given in order: head first, so at turn 39, head is at (4,1), and it just moved down to there? Head direction is D, meaning it's facing down, so from previous position, it must have come from above? Let's see the positions: [(4,1), (4,2), ...] so from (4,2) to (4,1), which is down? (4,2) to (4,1) is decreasing y, so moving down if y increases up? I need to define coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that means y=0 is bottom, and y increases as you go up? But in the wall, y=0 and y=7 are borders. Similarly, U (x,y+1) should be moving up, so y increases upward.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (4,1), then (4,2). If head is at (4,1) and direction is D, down, meaning it was at (4,2) before and moved down to (4,1)? Positions list: [(4,1), (4,2), ...] so index 0 is head, so at current turn, head is at (4,1), and the next segment is (4,2), which means the snake was at (4,2) previously and moved down to (4,1). But direction is given as current head direction, which is D, down.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All positive food, since value is 1.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (6,1), life span 3 at turn 39, so it will disappear after turn 41? Let's see: at turn 39, life span is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including turn 39.

Also, there are internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). I need to avoid these cells as well.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4).

So for (6,1), life span 2 at turn 40: after turn 40, it will have 1 left, and after turn 41, it will disappear, so it can be eaten on turn 40 or 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) life span 4: disappears after turn 43? Turn 40: life span 4, after turn 40, 3 left; turn 41, 2 left; turn 42, 1 left; turn 43, 0, disappears.

Disappears before turn 44.\n> \n> (5,3): L=6, can be eaten turns 41 to 46.\n> \n> (1,4): L=9, turns 41 to 49.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,1), direction R. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite, which would be left, but since direction is right, opposite is left, so cannot move L immediately).\n> \n> Movement constraints: no instant reverse. Current head direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on this turn. Possible moves: U (up, to (6,2)? y+1 is up, I think. Coordinates: let's define.\n> \n> Typically, in grids, (x,y) with x increasing right, y increasing up or down? The movement says U: (x,y+1) which is up if y increases up, but in many games, y increases down. But here it says U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases as we go up.\n> \n> In the state, snake positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc. (4,1) to (4,2) is moving up? (4,1) to (4,2) is y from 1 to 2, which is y+1, so U. Similarly, (3,2) to (3,3) is U, (3,3) to (3,4) is U, then (3,4) to (4,4) is R? (3,4) to (4,4) is x from 3 to 4, so right, R.\n> \n> Yes, so y increases as we go up, so (x,y) with y=1 bottom, y=7 top? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so playable y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But internal obstacles, so not all cells are free.\n> \n> For example, snake head at (6,1), which is x=6, y=1. Since x=7 is wall, so x=6 is playable, y=1 is playable since y=0 wall.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5), (5,3), (1,4), all within 1-6 in x and y.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - U: (6,1+1) = (6,2)\n> \n> - D: (6,1-1) = (6,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: (6-1,1) = (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (6,1) head, then (5,1) is the next segment, so moving left to (5,1) would be moving into the body, but it's the tail? Let's see.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when you move, the tail moves, so it's ok to move to the tail's current position if the tail will move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, from (6,1), moving L to (5,1): (5,1) is currently occupied by the second segment of the snake. The snake positions are: index 0: head (6,1), index 1: (5,1), index 2: (4,1), index 3: (4,2), etc.\n> \n> When we move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,1), which is currently occupied by the segment at index 1. After move, head moves to (5,1), and the tail, which is (4,4) I think, moves to the next position.\n> \n> Let's list snake positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> So segments: head: (6,1), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail: (4,4)? Tail is last, (4,4).\n> \n> If I move left to (5,1), which is currently occupied by the second segment. After moving, the head will be at (5,1), and the tail will move, so the segment that was at (5,1) will move to where? When head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if head moves to a new position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (5,1), then the segment that was at (5,1) moves to where? The new head is at (5,1), but (5,1) was previously occupied by index 1.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head position: (5,1)\n> \n> - Then new body: the old head position (6,1) becomes the new position for index 1? No.\n> \n> The body segments follow: the segment that was at index 1 moves to the old head position? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to a new cell. Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions: before move: segment 0: (6,1), seg1: (5,1), seg2: (4,1), seg3: (4,2), seg4: (3,2), seg5: (3,3), seg6: (3,4), seg7: (4,4) tail.\n> \n> If head moves left to (5,1), which is the current position of seg1. After move:\n> \n> - New head at (5,1)\n> \n> - Then seg1 moves to where seg0 was, (6,1)? But (6,1) is now empty? No: the movement is: head moves to new position, then each body segment from neck to tail-1 moves to the position of the next segment, but since the list shifts.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, the tail segment is removed, but if no food eaten, tail is removed; if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,1), which has food? (5,1) is not a food position, foods are at (3,5), (5,3), (1,4). So (5,1) is empty? No, it's occupied by snake body seg1.\n> \n> But according to rule, moving to tail is allowed, but (5,1) is not the tail; tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> (5,1) is the neck, the first body segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But here, (5,1) is not the tail; tail is (4,4). So moving to (5,1) would cause collision with body, because it's not the tail.\n> \n> Let me read: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only the tail cell is safe to move into; other body segments are deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,1), moving L to (5,1) is invalid because (5,1) is a body segment and not the tail.\n> \n> Moving D to (6,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving R to (7,1) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving U to (6,2) is possible, since not wall and not occupied? (6,2) is not in snake positions, and not wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — no (6,2), so empty.\n> \n> Also, not a wall, since walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, and internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) — (6,2) not among them.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that right?

Let's see.\n> \n> After head moves to (6,2):\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then the body segments: the first body segment moves to old head position (6,1)\n> \n> - Second body segment moves to old first body position (5,1)\n> \n> - Third to (4,1)\n> \n> - Fourth to (4,2)  // old (4,2) was position\n> \n> Positions before move: seg0: (6,1), seg1: (5,1), seg2: (4,1), seg3: (4,2), seg4: (3,2), seg5: (3,3), seg6: (3,4), seg7: (4,4)\n> \n> After move to (6,2), no food eaten, so snake shortens?

Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize:\n> \n> - Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> - Walls: borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> - Snake: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).

Internal obstacles? (3,6) etc., not (6,3). So (6,3) should be free, but I need to check if it's occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are [(6,2) head, (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. So (6,3) is not in this list, so it's empty.\n> \n> Similarly, move L to (5,2): x=5,y=2. Not border, not internal obstacle? Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) — (5,6) is wall, but (5,2) is not listed, so free. Snake body? (5,1) is body, but (5,2) is not occupied, so should be ok.\n> \n> Move R to (7,2): but x=7 is border wall, so invalid. Cannot move there.\n> \n> Move D: to (6,1) but (6,1) is the first body segment. Is this a collision?\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail in some cases. But when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by body, it's collision.\n> \n> But specifically, it says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, (6,1) is the neck, not the tail. Tail is at (3,4). So moving to (6,1) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is occupied by snake body, so moving D to (6,1) is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (6,2): U to (6,3) or L to (5,2). R and D are invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, there's food to consider.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (3,5): life span 2, so disappears after 2 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 42, life span 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 43? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,5) with life span 2 on turn 42. After turn 42, life span becomes 1. After turn 43, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 42 or 43, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 5, so available until turn 46 (42 to 46, 5 turns: turn 42,43,44,45,46? Countdown: at turn t, life span L, after turn t, L decreases by 1, so if L=2 at turn t, after t it becomes 1, after t+1 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it exists during turn t and t+1, can be eaten on turn t or t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, L=5 at turn 42, exists until turn 46 (42,43,44,45,46), disappears after turn 46.\n> \n> L=8 at (1,4), exists until turn 49.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's see where the snake is and where food is.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,2), body going down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), up to (4,1)? (4,1) to (4,2) is up, then (4,2) to (3,2) left, (3,2) to (3,3) up, (3,3) to (3,4) up. So tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Food at (3,5), which is directly above the tail? (3,4) is tail, so (3,5) is one cell above tail. Also, (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, and (1,4) at x=1,y=4.\n> \n> (3,5) has short life, only 2 turns, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But to eat food under body or near tail, there are special cases.\n> \n> First, (3,5) is not under snake body currently. Snake body is at (3,2),(3,3),(3,4), so (3,5) is adjacent to tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> But here, the food is at (3,5), not on the tail cell. Tail cell is (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) has no food, I think. Food is only at the positions listed.\n> \n> So for (3,5), if head moves to (3,5), it can eat it, but only if the food is there and head moves onto it.\n> \n> But also, since the tail is at (3,4), and if head eats (3,5), snake grows, so new tail position after move.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows: head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat food, head moves to food, new segment added at head, tail stays or moves? In most snake games, when you eat, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> Rule says: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> And \"the tail will also move forward\" only when not eating, I assume.\n> \n> From the description: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" and \"newly grown tail\".\n> \n> Also, in movement, tail moves every turn unless eating.\n> \n> I think it's standard: each turn, snake moves one cell in direction, if it eats food, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was or something? No.\n> \n> Typically: when snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail leaves its cell. If no food eaten, tail cell becomes empty. If food eaten, after moving, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving, so tail doesn't advance, and length increases.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and since food is eaten, that cell becomes head, and the body follows, but tail doesn't move, so a new segment is effectively added at the old tail position.\n> \n> For collision: after move, if head is at same position as any body segment, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,5): if head moves to (3,5) when tail is at (3,4), and (3,5) has food, so it eats it. Then, after eating, head is at (3,5), and since it ate, tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail at (3,4) is still there, and a new segment is added? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Assume standard snake mechanics:\n> \n> - Each turn, the snake moves one step in the chosen direction.\n> \n> - The head moves to the new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> - If the head moves to a cell with food, then after the move, the snake grows: the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, and the tail remains there for this turn. Thus, length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, tail moves forward, so the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose positions at time t: head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new position, seg1 at old head, seg2 at old seg1, ..., tail at old second last, and old tail position empty.\n> \n> With eating: new head at food position, seg1 at old head, ..., but tail does not move, so tail stays, and a new segment is added where? Actually, the tail segment remains, so positions: new head, then old head becomes new seg1, old seg1 becomes new seg2, ..., and the old tail is still there, so the segment that was tail is now the second last, and a new segment is not added per se; instead, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> For example: snake at turn t: A (head), B, C (tail)\n> \n> Move to new cell D (with food): then at t+1, head at D, then B (which was behind head), then C (tail). But since ate food, tail doesn't move, so C remains tail. Positions: D (head), B, C (tail). Length was 3, now 3, but should be +1? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Better to think: the body segments follow the head. When moving to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to new cell (food), and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail position doesn't change, and the new segment becomes the new tail? No.\n> \n> Standard: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move; that is, the last segment remains, so the snake grows by one segment at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: before move: head, body..., tail\n> \n> After move and eat: head moves to new position (food), the first body segment moves to old head, and so on, but the tail segment does not move; it stays in place. So the new position list is: new head, old head, old body1, ..., old tail. And since tail didn't move, old tail is still there, so the snake has one more segment; the old second last is now part of body, and old tail is still tail.\n> \n> For example: positions at t: H, B, T (length 3)\n> \n> Move to F (food) with direction to F.\n> \n> Then at t+1: head at F, B at H, and T stays at T, so positions: F (head), H (body), T (tail), length 3, but should be 4? Mistake.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Upon eating food, the tail does not move for that turn, so the segment that was the tail remains, and a new head position is added, so the length increases.\n> \n> So from: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n> \n> After moving to food: head moves to food cell, B1 moves to old H, B2 to old B1, ..., Bk to old B_{k-1}, and T does not move, so T stays, and the new position list is: new head (food), old H (now body), old B1 (body), ..., old Bk (body), old T (tail). But old Bk was the second last, now it moves to old B_{k-1}, so positions are: food, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T. Length increased by one, with T still at its position.\n> \n> In this case, for a snake with segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n> \n> After move to new cell with food: S0 moves to new position, so new head is new position, then S1 is at old S0, S2 at old S1, ..., Sk at old S_{k-1}, and since eating, a new segment is added at old Sk, so new positions: new position (head), old S0, old S1, ..., old S_{k-1}, old Sk (new tail).\n> \n> So the tail moves to old S_{k-1}, and a new segment is at old Sk position.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after the move, the head is at new position, and it collides if that position is occupied by any body segment.\n> \n> For the food at (3,5), which is above tail at (3,4).\n> \n> If head moves to (3,5) and eats the food, then the new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head position becomes body, and so on.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail was at (3,4), and if head moves to (3,5), which is adjacent, and eats, then after move, head is at (3,5), and the body includes the old tail position if it wasn't moved, but in the growth, the tail moves to the second last position, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> Let's simulate with current snake.\n> \n> Current turn 42, positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail.

B6 was at (3,3), moved to old B5 position (3,2), and T was at (3,4), moved to old B6 position (3,3), so new position: (5,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), and new segment at (3,4).\n> \n> But (3,4) is where the tail was, so it's occupied.\n> \n> Now, back to the immediate choice.\n> \n> At turn 42, from (6,2), I can:\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (6,3)\n> \n> Then head at (6,3), body at (6,2), (6,1), etc., tail at (3,4). No food eaten, so tail moves: the segment at (3,4) moves to old B6 position, which is (3,3), but B6 was at (3,3), moves to (3,2)? Positions: after move U, head to (6,3), then B1 to (6,2), B2 to (6,1), B3 to (5,1), B4 to (4,1), B5 to (4,2), B6 to (3,2), T to (3,3).

So (5,1) is occupied, so moving D to (5,1) is collision.\n> \n> So from (5,2), can move U to (5,3) or L to (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) is body? (4,2) is in the list, occupied, so cannot move to (4,2).\n> \n> Positions: (5,2) head, then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).

From there, it would take more turns to reach (3,5), but (3,5) disappears after turn 43, so I can't eat it on turn 44. So impossible to eat (3,5) if I don't go directly.\n> \n> But from (6,2) on turn 42, if I move U to (6,3), then on turn 43, head at (6,3), I can move to (6,4), (5,3), or (7,3) but x=7 wall, or (6,2) but reverse not allowed if direction U.\n> \n> From (6,3), after moving U, direction U.\n> \n> Then turn 43, move U to (6,4), or L to (5,3), or R to (7,3) invalid, D not allowed.\n> \n> (5,3) has food, but I can eat it.\n> \n> (3,5) is at (3,5), from (6,3) to (3,5) is three left and two up, not reachable in one move.

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. The cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, but let's confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are occupied by walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, and y=0 and y=7 are walls. But there are also internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 1, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (5,2) is where the snake head is currently? Snake positions start with (5,2) as head, and food at (5,2) is listed. But according to the rules, food can be under the snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (5,2), and there's food at (5,2) with life span 10. But since the head is already on it, can it be eaten? The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Here, the head is on (5,2), but the body is also there? No, the head is a separate segment. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> At turn t1=43, snake positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n> \n> So (5,2) is the head, and (6,2) is the first body segment, etc. Food at (5,2) is under the head. But to eat it, the body must move away first? The rule says \"the body moves away\", meaning the segment that was on that cell moves away, then the head can move back to eat it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, since the head is currently on (5,2), if I move the head away, then later if I move back when no body is there, I can eat it. But right now, since the head is on it, I might be able to eat it immediately? The rule doesn't specify if head moving onto it while on it counts.\n> \n> Let me read the rule again: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> It says \"the body moves away\", implying that if food is under a body segment, not the head. For the head, if food is under the head, it might be eaten immediately when spawned, but in this case, the food is at (5,2) with life span 10, so it was probably just spawned or has been there.\n> \n> In the state, at turn t1, the head is at (5,2), and food is at (5,2). But in Snake, when you move onto a food, you eat it and grow. But here, since it's under the head, I think I need to move away and back to eat it, because the rule specifies the body must move away first.\n> \n> This is confusing. Let me think.\n> \n> Perhaps for food under the head, it can be eaten only if the head moves off and then back on after the body has moved.\n> \n> But that seems odd. In standard Snake, if food appears under head, you might eat it immediately, but here the rule is specific about body moving away.\n> \n> Let's look at the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body\" — body includes all segments except head? Or including head? Typically, \"body\" might refer to non-head parts.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the body moves away\" and \"the head moves onto the food cell\".\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> For now, at position (5,2), there is food, and head is on it. Since the head is on it, and it's the current position, I think I might not have eaten it yet; it needs to be eaten when I move onto it, but I'm already on it.\n> \n> I think the state is given at the start of the turn, so at turn t1=43, the snake is at positions, and food is listed, including at (5,2). So the food is under the head, but since the head just moved there or something, it hasn't been eaten yet. So to eat it, I need to move the head off and then back when the cell is free, or something.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\" So for food under head, since head is not body, I need to move the head away, then when the body (which is now on that cell) moves away, then head moves back to eat.\n> \n> Let's clarify with an example.\n> \n> Suppose at some turn, food is under a body segment. Then when that body segment moves away (say, when the snake moves forward), the cell becomes empty, but food is still there if life span >0. Then if head moves to that cell later, it can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, if food is under head, when head moves away, the body segment that was behind might be on that cell now, so it's under body, not head. Then to eat, that body must move away, and head move back.\n> \n> In this case, at turn t1, head at (5,2), so food at (5,2) is under head. When I move the head to a new position, the next segment (6,2) will move to (5,2) in the next turn, so the food will be under the body at (5,2) after the move.\n> \n> Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> At turn t1, positions: head (5,2), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc.\n> \n> I choose an action: U, D, L, or R.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so I can move L, U, D, but not R directly opposite? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: L (left), U (up), D (down). R is not allowed because it's opposite to L.\n> \n> Now, if I move, say, L to (4,2), then the snake will be: head to (4,2), then body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc., but when the head moves to (4,2), the segment that was at (5,2) is now the new position for the first body segment, which was (6,2), so it moves to (5,2), and so on.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,2), the positions become: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)? No.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: new head position, then the previous head becomes first body, previous first body becomes second, etc., but the tail moves off.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (5,2), 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: tail (3,3)\n> \n> If I move head to (4,2), but (4,2) is currently occupied by segment 5, which is at (4,2). Oh, collision! (4,2) is a body segment, so if I move to (4,2), it's a body collision and I die.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (5,3), or D to (5,1), or L to (4,2).\n> \n> Let's list possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - L: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is occupied by snake body (segment 5), so collision, death.\n> \n> - R: to (6,2) — but (6,2) is occupied by segment 1, and also R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - U: to (5,3) — what is at (5,3)? Not in snake positions, and not a wall, so possible.\n> \n> - D: to (5,1) — (5,1) is occupied by segment 3, so collision.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (4,2) is occupied\n> \n> - (5,1) is occupied\n> \n> - (6,2) is occupied and opposite direction\n> \n> - (5,3) is not occupied, and no wall there? Walls are borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is within 1-6,1-6, and internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) — none at (5,3), so (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, is there another move? Only U is possible? What about D? (5,1) is occupied, so no. L to (4,2) occupied, R not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (5,3).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since borders are walls.\n> \n> (5,3): x=5, y=3, both between 1 and 6, not in obstacles, not occupied by snake except possibly.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> (3,3) is the tail, but (5,3) is not in the list, so empty.\n> \n> Also, food at (5,3) is listed with life span 4, value 1.\n> \n> So if I move U to (5,3), I will eat the food there, since head moves onto it, and it's positive food, so I grow: length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so new positions: head at (5,3), then the previous head (5,2) becomes new body, so body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail stays? No, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the next move, the tail doesn't advance, so you gain a segment.\n> \n> At the start of turn, before move, positions given.\n> \n> I choose to move to (5,3), which has food, so after moving, head is at (5,3), and since food is eaten, the body grows: so the tail segment remains, and new segment added at the end.\n> \n> Positions after move and eat: head (5,3), then previous positions: (5,2) becomes body, (6,2) body, (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), and (3,3) remains tail, but since we ate, we add a new segment, so tail is still (3,3), and we have a new segment? No.\n> \n> After moving to a food cell, the snake grows, so the length increases by one. Mechanically: the head moves to the new cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the last position is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Typically: when head moves to new cell with food, the head is now there, the body segments move to the previous positions, but the tail stays, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to a cell with food: new head position P, then the body is [H, B1, B2, ..., T], so positions become [P, H, B1, B2, ..., T], and since we ate, length increases, so the tail T is still there, and we have the same number of segments but with head at P and previous head now body.\n> \n> But the length increases, so there is an extra segment.\n> \n> Initial: 8 segments.\n> \n> After move to food: head moves to new position, say P, then the body consists of the previous head position and all previous body positions except the tail might stay or something.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position, but the tail does not move, so the last position is occupied by two segments for that turn? No, in terms of positions, when you eat, the tail position remains, and a new segment is added there, so the snake grows.\n> \n> For positions: before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] for k body segments.\n> \n> After move without eat: new positions [H_new, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] so T is gone, and H_new is head.\n> \n> After move with eat: [H_new, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] so T remains, and we have one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, initial: indices: 0:H(5,2), 1:B1(6,2), 2:B2(6,1), 3:B3(5,1), 4:B4(4,1), 5:B5(4,2), 6:B6(3,2), 7:T(3,3) — so 8 segments, positions from 0 to 7.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3) and eat, then new positions: head at (5,3), then previous H at (5,2) becomes B1, then B1 at (6,2) becomes B2, B2 at (6,1) becomes B3, B3 at (5,1) becomes B4, B4 at (4,1) becomes B5, B5 at (4,2) becomes B6, B6 at (3,2) becomes B7, and tail T at (3,3) remains, so new positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] — 9 segments, with (3,2) and (3,3) both occupied, but (3,2) was B6, now B7, and (3,3) is tail.\n> \n> In the list, (3,2) is now the second last segment, and (3,3) is tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if no eat, after move, positions would be [H_new, H, B1, ..., B6] so T is not included, length decreases? No, without eat, the tail moves, so positions become [H_new, H, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6] since B6 was (3,2), and T (3,3) is left, so snake has 8 segments still.\n> \n> Back to the point: at turn t1, from (5,2), I can only move U to (5,3) because other moves are invalid or cause collision.\n> \n> L to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by B5, collision.\n> \n> D to (5,1): (5,1) is occupied by B3, collision.\n> \n> R to (6,2): occupied by B1 and opposite direction, not allowed.\n> \n> U to (5,3): free, and has food.\n> \n> So I must move U to (5,3) and eat the food there.\n> \n> But the action sequence is for multiple turns, and I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> The current turn is t1=43, and I need to output actions for turn 43, 44, 45, etc., but probably not too many, but since it's a sequence, I should plan a few moves.\n> \n> First, for turn 43: I have no choice but to move U to (5,3).\n> \n> After this move, I eat the food at (5,3), so snake grows to 9 segments.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,3), body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> Head direction after move: since I moved U, direction is now U.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is eaten, so it should be removed, but life span was 4, but eaten, so gone.\n> \n> Other food: (3,5) life span 1, (1,4) life span 7, (5,2) life span 10, but (5,2) is now occupied by body, so food under body.\n> \n> Also, after move, the food at (5,2) is still there, under the body segment at (5,2).\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current?

Let's see:\n> \n> After head moves U to (5,4):\n> \n> - New head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (5,2)) moves to old head position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (6,2)) moves to old segment 1 position (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (6,1)) moves to old segment 2 position (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (5,1)) moves to old segment 3 position (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was at (4,1)) moves to old segment 4 position (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was at (4,2)) moves to old segment 5 position (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was at (3,2)) moves to old segment 6 position (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was at (3,3)) moves to old segment 7 position (3,2)\n> \n> - Old tail was segment 8 at (3,3), which moved to (3,2), so cell (3,3) is free.\n> \n> Now, cell (5,2) is now occupied by segment 2, which moved there from (6,2). Food is at (5,2), and it's now under segment 2? But food can be under body, it's just not eaten yet.\n> \n> To eat it, we need head to move to (5,2) when it's free.\n> \n> But after this move, (5,2) is occupied by a body segment, not free.\n> \n> Let's see the positions after move U:\n> \n> Head: (5,4)\n> \n> Body: (5,3) [was head], (5,2) [was seg1, now moved to (5,3)? No:\n> \n> List new positions:\n> \n> - Index 0: head at (5,4)\n> \n> - Index 1: at (5,3)  // old head\n> \n> - Index 2: at (5,2)  // old seg1, was at (5,2), but moved? No: when snake moves, each body segment takes the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - New position 0: new head position\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New position k: old position k-1 for k=1 to len-1\n> \n> Then the last position (old tail) is removed.\n> \n> So here, length 9, positions old: idx 0: (5,3), 1: (5,2), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3)\n> \n> After head moves to (5,4):\n> \n> - New idx 0: (5,4)\n> \n> - New idx 1: old idx 0 = (5,3)\n> \n> - New idx 2: old idx 1 = (5,2)\n> \n> - New idx 3: old idx 2 = (6,2)\n> \n> - New idx 4: old idx 3 = (6,1)\n> \n> - New idx 5: old idx 4 = (5,1)\n> \n> - New idx 6: old idx 5 = (4,1)\n> \n> - New idx 7: old idx 6 = (4,2)\n> \n> - New idx 8: old idx 7 = (3,2)  // old idx 8 (3,3) is gone\n> \n> So new snake: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> Cell (5,2) is now occupied by idx 2, which is a body segment. Food is at (5,2), so it's still under the body.\n> \n> To eat it, we need the body to move away so (5,2) is free, then head moves to it.\n> \n> But currently, after one move, (5,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> In fact, since the snake is long, and (5,2) is a body segment, it will take several moves for that cell to be free.\n> \n> Specifically, the food at (5,2) can be eaten only when the segment that is there moves away and the head comes later.\n> \n> But the head is at (5,3) now, moving to (5,4), so (5,2) is behind.\n> \n> Perhaps we can move in a way that the head circles back, but it's risky.\n> \n> There's another food at (1,4) with life span 7.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 44, life span 7 means it disappears after 7 turns, so on turn 51 it will be gone? Life span decreases each turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N, I think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 44, food has life span 7, so after 7 turns, on turn 44 + 7 = 51, it will disappear. Similarly for the other food, life span 9, disappears on turn 44 + 9 = 53.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score with survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - All cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Plus (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction U, so can move U, L, R (not D).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,4)\n> \n> - D: forbidden (reverse)\n> \n> - L: to (4,3)\n> \n> - R: to (6,3)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid, no collision.\n> \n> First, U to (5,4): is this free? Current positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (6,2), etc. (5,4) is not in snake positions, and not a wall? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,4) is within, and internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) — (5,6) is a wall, but (5,4) is not listed, so should be free. Similarly, not border, so ok.\n> \n> L to (4,3): (4,3) not in snake positions? Snake: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — (4,3) not listed, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> R to (6,3): (6,3) not in snake, not wall? Internal obstacles: (5,6) is wall, but (6,3) not listed, borders ok, so free.\n> \n> But (6,3) might be close to body, but since tail moves, it could be ok.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,4) and (5,2)\n> \n> (5,2) is on the body, so not immediately eatable. We need to free that cell first.\n> \n> To free (5,2), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (5,2) moves away and no body is there when head comes.\n> \n> But the food has life span 9, so until turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,4) with life span 7, until turn 51.\n> \n> Now, (1,4) is far away, at x=1,y=4.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), so we need to go left and up.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate moves.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (3,3). Head is at (5,3), which is not adjacent; adjacent cells would be (4,3), (5,4), (5,2), (6,3). Tail at (3,3), so not adjacent. Distance is |5-3| + |3-3| = 2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, for food at (5,2): it's on the body, so to eat it, we need to have the head move to (5,2) after it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied by segment 1. When the snake moves, depending on direction, the segment moves.\n> \n> For example, if we move U, as before, (5,2) becomes occupied by segment 2 (which was (6,2)).\n> \n> If we move L to (4,3), let's see what happens.\n> \n> If head moves L to (4,3):\n> \n> New head: (4,3)\n> \n> New idx 1: old idx 0 = (5,3)\n> \n> New idx 2: old idx 1 = (5,2)\n> \n> New idx 3: old idx 2 = (6,2)\n> \n> etc., down to new idx 8: old idx 7 = (3,2)\n> \n> Old tail (3,3) gone.\n> \n> So (5,2) is now idx 2, still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (6,3):\n> \n> New head: (6,3)\n> \n> New idx 1: (5,3)\n> \n> New idx 2: (5,2)  // old idx 1\n> \n> Still occupied.\n> \n> So after one move, (5,2) is still part of the body, just a different segment.\n> \n> It will take multiple moves to free (5,2).\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be free when the tail moves away from it.\n> \n> Current tail is at (3,3). When the snake moves, the tail position changes.\n> \n> For example, if we keep moving, the tail will move to (3,2) or something.\n> \n> But to free (5,2), we need the snake to move so that the segment that is at (5,2) is the tail at some point, and when it moves, (5,2) is free.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is idx 1, not tail. Tail is idx 8 at (3,3).\n> \n> The distance from head to tail in the chain.\n> \n> Positions: head (5,3), then (5,2) is next, so it's very close to head.\n> \n> If we move in a way that the snake doesn't grow, the tail will eventually reach (5,2) after some moves, but since the snake is long, it takes time.\n> \n> Let's estimate how many turns to free (5,2).\n> \n> The segment at (5,2) is idx 1. When the snake moves, idx 1 moves to the old head position, and so on. The position (5,2) will be occupied until the tail passes through it.\n> \n> The tail is currently at (3,3), which is idx 8.\n> \n> The path from head to tail: from (5,3) to (5,2) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (3,3).\n> \n> So the cell (5,2) is the second cell from head.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed, but (5,2) is not tail.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be freed when the segment that is currently at (5,2) becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> Currently, idx 1 at (5,2). After one move, it moves to (5,3) or something, but the position (5,2) is still occupied by another segment.\n> \n> In fact, the position (5,2) will be occupied as long as there is a body segment there, which will be until the tail end reaches that point.\n> \n> The tail is 8 segments away in the chain.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, it will take approximately 8 moves for the tail to reach the position where (5,2) is now, but as the snake moves, the positions shift.\n> \n> Let's think of the snake as a queue. Each move, head moves to new cell, tail is dequeued if no growth.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) is currently occupied by the body, and it will remain occupied until that \"slot\" is at the tail.\n> \n> Since the segments move forward, the cell (5,2) will be free when the segment that is now at the tail has moved to (5,2), but that's not how it works.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to simulate.\n> \n> Suppose we don't eat any food and just move. After k moves, the cell that was at position m will be at position m-k or something.\n> \n> Initial: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P8 with P0 head, P8 tail.\n> \n> After one move to new head Q, new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P7\n> \n> So the old P1 is now at index 1, position P0.\n> \n> The cell that was P1 (e.g. (5,2)) is no longer occupied if no segment is there, but in new positions, P0 is now at index 1, so the position P0 is occupied, position P1 is now occupied by the segment that was at P1, but it moved to P0? No.\n> \n> The new position list has: new head at some cell, then P0, then P1, then P2, ..., up to P7.\n> \n> So the physical cell that was P1 is not in the new list; it was occupied by old P1, but in new positions, old P1 is at index 2, at position P1? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's use coordinates.\n> \n> At turn t, cell C = (5,2) is occupied by segment at index 1.\n> \n> After one move, the segment that was at index 1 is now at index 2, at the position that was old index 0, which is (5,3) if head moved U, for example.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at old index 2, which was (6,2), so now at new index 3 at (6,2)? From earlier simulation:\n> \n> After move U: new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), then (5,2), then (6,2), etc. So (5,2) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at (6,2), which is new index 2 at (5,2).\n> \n> So the cell (5,2) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> It will continue to be occupied until the tail passes through it.\n> \n> The tail is currently at (3,3). When the snake moves, the tail moves to the position of the previous tail-1, but eventually, the cell (5,2) will be the tail position after some moves.\n> \n> The current tail is at (3,3). The position (5,2) is part of the body, and the distance from tail to that cell in the path.\n> \n> The snake body from tail to head: tail (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) head.\n> \n> So from tail to (5,2): it's the seventh segment from tail or something.\n> \n> Positions in order from head to tail: idx 0: (5,3), 1: (5,2), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3)\n> \n> So (5,2) is idx 1.\n> \n> The tail is idx 8 at (3,3).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail index decreases.\n> \n> After one move with no growth, new tail is old idx 7 at (3,2).\n> \n> After two moves, new tail old idx 6 at (4,2), and so on.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be the tail when the index of that position is 8.\n> \n> Currently, idx 1 is at (5,2).

Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn 45, life span 8, turn 46:7, ..., turn 52: life span 1, turn 53:0, disappears, so on turn 52, it is still there with life span 1.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn 52, if head moves to (5,2), it can be eaten.\n> \n> But we need to ensure that on turn 52, (5,2) is free and head can move there.\n> \n> From above, on turn 51, tail is at (5,2), so on turn 52, when snake moves, tail leaves (5,2), so it is free, and head can move to it if possible.\n> \n> But we need to control the snake's position to be able to move to (5,2) on turn 52.\n> \n> First, we need to survive until then and have a path.\n> \n> Also, during these 7 turns, we might eat other food or not.\n> \n> But there's another food at (1,4) with life span 7, disappearing at turn 51.\n> \n> If we go for (1,4), we might not be back for (5,2).\n> \n> We need to decide which food to target.\n> \n> Also, we must avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the grid with obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> Borders: x=0, y=0; x=0,y=1; ... x=0,y=7; similarly x=7,y=0 to 7; y=0,x=0 to 7; y=7,x=0 to 7.

It's turn 45, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2).

Food can be under the snake body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied by a body segment, and there's food there. So, if the snake moves such that this segment moves away and later the head moves to (5,2), it can be eaten. But I need to be careful because of the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (3,2). Let's see the snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,3)\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,2)\n> \n> 3: (6,2)\n> \n> 4: (6,1)\n> \n> 5: (5,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,1)\n> \n> 7: (4,2)\n> \n> 8: tail (3,2)\n> \n> So tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Food at (5,2) is on segment index 2, which is not the tail. The tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Also, food at (1,4).\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,3), moving left (L), so from (4,3), moving left would go to (3,3)? Let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,3)\n> \n> Direction: L (left), so last move was left, but I can change direction except instant reverse. Since moving left, I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,4) but y+1?

No walls or obstacles, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,3) head, (5,3), (5,2), etc. (4,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (4,2): is it free? (4,2) is a body segment, index 7, so occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> (5,3) is body segment index 1, occupied.\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,4): free\n> \n> - D to (4,2): occupied, invalid\n> \n> - L to (3,3): free\n> \n> - R to (5,3): occupied, invalid\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction.

To eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto it.\n> \n> The body will move as the snake moves. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, for (5,2), which is the second segment, when the snake moves forward, this segment will move to where the next segment is or something. Let's think about the snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail position is vacated, except when eating food, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can only be eaten if that cell is free when head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied. As the snake moves, if the segment at (5,2) moves away, then (5,2) becomes free, and if later the head moves to (5,2), it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food has a life span; it disappears after N turns.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,4).\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it is deadly.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2). Head is at (4,3), which is adjacent? (4,3) and (3,2): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so not adjacent horizontally or vertically; it's diagonal. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (4,3) and (3,2): |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n> \n> Adjacent cells would be (4,3) to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3).\n> \n> (3,2) is down-left, not directly adjacent.\n> \n> So head is not adjacent to tail currently.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2), and it has no food on it; the food is at (5,2) and (1,4), not on tail.\n> \n> Food at (5,2) is on a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2), no food mentioned there.\n> \n> So no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves for turns 45,46,47,48,49 at least, but since food has life span, I might want to eat them within their life.\n> \n> Food at (1,4): life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 45+5=50? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N -1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for L turns including the current one.\n> \n> For example, at turn 45, life_span 6, so it is present on turns 45,46,47,48,49,50. After turn 50, it disappears, so last chance to eat is on turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,2) life_span 8, present until turn 45+7=52? Turns: 45 to 45+7=52 inclusive? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn t, food with life_span L:\n> \n> - On turn t, countdown = L, decreases to L-1 after the turn.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown decreases, so at start of turn t, countdown is L.\n> \n> After the turn, if not eaten, countdown becomes L-1.\n> \n> It disappears when countdown reaches 0 after the turn.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's: at the beginning of turn t, food has countdown C.\n> \n> During the turn, if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n> \n> After the turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases by 1.\n> \n> If countdown was 1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (1,4) at turn 45: life_span=6, so countdown=6 at start of turn 45.\n> \n> After turn 45, if not eaten, countdown=5.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 50, if not eaten, countdown=0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 45 to 50 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,2): life_span=8, can be eaten on turns 45 to 52 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, to eat (5,2), since it's under the body, I need the body to move away first.\n> \n> The body segment at (5,2) will move when the snake moves. Depending on the movement, it might move soon or late.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (5,2) is the third segment?

Let's see:\n> \n> After move U:\n> \n> - Head was (4,3), moves to (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (5,3) moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (5,2) moves to (5,3)  // since segment 1 moved to head old position\n> \n> - Segment 3 (6,2) moves to (5,2)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> After move U to (4,4):\n> \n> New positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2)? Tail was (3,2), but when moving, the last segment moves to where the second last was.\n> \n> List old positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (4,3) head\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,2)\n> \n> 3: (6,2)\n> \n> 4: (6,1)\n> \n> 5: (5,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,1)\n> \n> 7: (4,2)\n> \n> 8: (3,2) tail\n> \n> After move U, head to (4,4)\n> \n> Then new position 0: (4,4)\n> \n> 1: old position 0, (4,3)\n> \n> 2: old position 1, (5,3)\n> \n> 3: old position 2, (5,2)\n> \n> 4: old position 3, (6,2)\n> \n> 5: old position 4, (6,1)\n> \n> 6: old position 5, (5,1)\n> \n> 7: old position 6, (4,1)\n> \n> 8: old position 7, (4,2)  // tail is now (4,2)\n> \n> Old tail (3,2) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, the cell (5,2) was occupied by segment 2, which moved to (5,3), so (5,2) is now occupied by segment 3, which moved from (6,2) to (5,2)? In the new positions, index 3 is at (5,2), because segment 3 moved to where segment 2 was.\n> \n> From above:\n> \n> New index 3: old position 2, which is (5,2)\n> \n> So (5,2) is still occupied by the body, now by segment index 3.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (3,3):\n> \n> Head from (4,3) to (3,3)\n> \n> New positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> So (5,2) is still occupied by index 3.\n> \n> In both cases, (5,2) remains occupied after one move.\n> \n> The food at (5,2) is under the body, and it will take several moves for that cell to be free.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be free when the segment that is there moves away, which happens when that segment is no longer part of the snake, i.e., when the tail moves past it.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied by segment index 2. The tail is index 8 at (3,2).\n> \n> The distance from head to that segment is 2 segments away.\n> \n> To free (5,2), the snake needs to move such that the tail moves beyond that point, but since eating food adds length, it might take longer.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, the snake length remains, so to free (5,2), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (5,2) becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> Currently, segment at (5,2) is index 2, tail is index 8. So there are 6 segments after it (indices 3 to 8), so it will take at least 6 moves for that segment to become the tail, and on the 7th move, the tail moves away from (5,2).\n> \n> Let's think.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was at position i will be at position i - k if k < i, or moved down.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) is occupied as long as there is a body segment there. The segment that is currently at (5,2) will move to the position of the previous segment each time, so it stays occupied until that segment is the tail and moves away.\n> \n> The segment at index 2 will be the tail after 6 moves, because there are 6 segments after it (indices 3 to 8, that's 6 segments).\n> \n> After 6 moves:\n> \n> - The head has moved 6 times.\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 2 will be at index 2 - 6? No.\n> \n> After each move, all segments shift down.\n> \n> After first move, the segment that was index 2 becomes index 1 if head moved, etc.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was at initial index i will be at index i - k for i >= k, or if i < k, it is no longer in the snake if k > i, but since we add segments only when eating, length constant.\n> \n> With no eating, length constant.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was at initial position i is now at position i - k in the new list, for i >= k.\n> \n> For example, after 1 move, initial index 1 is now index 0? No.\n> \n> Initial positions:\n> \n> Time t: indices 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n> \n> After one move to new head, new indices 0 (new head), 1 (old 0), 2 (old 1), 3 (old 2), ..., 8 (old 7)\n> \n> So the segment that was at initial index i is at new index i+1 for i from 0 to 7, and initial index 8 is gone, new tail is old index 7.\n> \n> For the cell (5,2), it is occupied by initial index 2.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was initial index 2 is at position 2 + k in the snake, but since the snake has fixed length, after k moves, it is at index min(2+k, something), but when 2+k >= length, it becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> Length is 9 segments.\n> \n> Initial index 2.\n> \n> After k moves, it is at index 2 + k.\n> \n> When 2 + k = 8, it is the tail (since indices 0 to 8, tail is 8).\n> \n> When it is the tail, on the next move, when the snake moves, the tail moves away from that cell.\n> \n> So when 2 + k = 8, k = 6.\n> \n> After 6 moves, the segment that was initial index 2 is at index 8, the tail.\n> \n> Then on the 7th move, when snake moves, the tail moves to a new position, so (5,2) is vacated.\n> \n> After 6 moves, at turn 45+6=51, the segment is at (5,2) as tail.\n> \n> Then on turn 52, when I move, the tail moves away, so (5,2) is free at the beginning of turn 52.\n> \n> But food at (5,2) has life span 8, so at turn 45, countdown 8, after turn 45, 7, ..., after turn 51, countdown 8 - 7 =1?

Head direction is L, which means it was moving left to (3,3) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and it was moving left to (3,3), so previous head was at (4,3), but (4,3) is the second position, which is the first body segment.

It's turn 47, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,4), then body segments: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is Up, which is (x,y+1). But since it's moving Up, and head is at (3,4), moving Up would go to (3,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1 and life span 4. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 47, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is given as the remaining life, I think. Let me read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (1,4), life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 47+4 = turn 51? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 47, it has 4 turns left, meaning it disappears at the end of turn 50? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t when it's spawned, life_span=N, after turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So for food at (1,4) with life_span=4 on turn 47:\n> \n> - Turn 47: life_span=4 (can be eaten now)\n> \n> - After turn 47, life_span decreases to 3\n> \n> - Turn 48: life_span=3\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 50, life_span=0, so it disappears before turn 51? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is life_span. But with countdown including current turn.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life_span L, and after the turn, if not eaten, life_span becomes L-1. When life_span reaches 0 after a turn, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten during the turn if head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life_span=6. So on turn 47, life_span=6, will disappear after turn 52 or something.\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life_span=9. Disappears later.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? Value is given as 1 for all, so no negative food here. But let's confirm: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and for (1,4) it's (1,4,4,1) — I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). In the input: \"(1, 4, 4, 1)\" so (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, \"(5, 2, 6, 1)\" and \"(1, 2, 9, 1)\". All value=1, so all positive food.\n> \n> But (5,2) is a food position, but looking at snake positions, (5,2) is occupied by the snake's body. Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), ...] so (5,2) is the 5th segment, which is the body, not the tail. Tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> But food is at (5,2), which is currently occupied by the snake. The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,2), it's under the snake body now, so to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (5,2), and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,4) and (1,2) are not occupied by snake, I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So (1,4) is free, (1,2) is free, but (5,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacles (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> So let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls? No, the input says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" so yes, all border cells are walls. And internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,4), direction Up. So from (3,4), moving Up would go to (3,5).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, reverse is D, so I cannot move Down next turn. So allowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their positions:\n> \n> - Food A: (1,4) value 1, life_span 4, so must be eaten by turn 50 or it disappears. Since after turn 47, life_span dec to 3; after turn 48, to 2; after turn 49, to 1; after turn 50, to 0 and disappears. So last chance to eat is on turn 50? On turn 50, if head moves to it, it can be eaten before life_span decreases to 0. Let's see the countdown.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — but for eating, if head moves to it during the turn, it is eaten before countdown decrease? I think so.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when head moves to food, it eats it at that turn.\n> \n> But for life_span, \"disappears after N turns\" with countdown decreasing each turn.\n> \n> To be safe, assume that on a turn when life_span > 0, it can be eaten; after that turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> For (1,4), life_span=4 at turn 47, so:\n> \n> - Turn 47: can be eaten, life_span will dec to 3 after\n> \n> - Turn 48: life_span=3, can be eaten, dec to 2 after\n> \n> - Turn 49: life_span=2, can be eaten, dec to 1 after\n> \n> - Turn 50: life_span=1, can be eaten, after eaten or not, dec to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So must be eaten by turn 50 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life_span=6: can be eaten from turn 47 to 52 inclusive.\n> \n> (1,2) life_span=9: longer time.\n> \n> But (5,2) is under snake body, so it can only be eaten if body moves away first.\n> \n> Now, snake body: segments: 0: head (3,4), 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,1), 7: (5,1), 8: tail (4,1)\n> \n> Food at (5,2) is exactly where segment 4 is.\n> \n> To eat it, segment 4 must move away, and then head moves to (5,2).\n> \n> But (5,2) is not adjacent to head right now. Head is at (3,4), (5,2) is two moves away, but with body in between.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,1), and no food there, so not an issue now.\n> \n> Now, possible actions at turn 47.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction U, so can move U, L, R.\n> \n> - Move U: to (3,5)\n> \n> - Move L: to (2,4)\n> \n> - Move R: to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> First, (3,5): is it wall or body? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 borders, so (3,5) is within, y=5<7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) is not listed, so free? Obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), so (3,5) should be free. Snake body: positions: (3,4) head will move, (3,3), (4,3), etc. (3,5) not occupied by body, so safe to move U to (3,5).\n> \n> Move L to (2,4): not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (2,1) and (2,3), but (2,4) not listed, so free. Snake body: (2,4) not in positions, so safe.\n> \n> Move R to (4,4): not wall, not obstacle, not body, so safe.\n> \n> All possible moves are safe immediately.\n> \n> Now, long-term: I need to eat food, especially (1,4) which has short life.\n> \n> (1,4) is at x=1,y=4.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), so same y, different x. Distance |3-1|=2 in x, same y, so if I go left, I can reach it.\n> \n> But there might be obstacles.\n> \n> Path to (1,4): from (3,4), to (2,4) to (1,4), but is (2,4) safe? Yes, as above. (1,4) is food, not wall.\n> \n> But there is obstacle at (1,3) and (2,3), but (1,4) and (2,4) are clear.\n> \n> (2,3) is obstacle, but (2,4) is above, so should be fine.\n> \n> So I can go L to (2,4) on turn 47, then on turn 48, move L to (1,4) to eat it.\n> \n> But head direction: current direction U, if I move L, new direction L.\n> \n> Then next turn, from (2,4), I can move L to (1,4), which is allowed since not reverse (reverse of L is R, but I'm moving L, so not reverse).\n> \n> But I need to think about the body. When I move to (1,4) on turn 48, I eat the food, so snake grows, length increases.\n> \n> Currently length 9, after eating, length 10.\n> \n> But (1,4) life_span 4, so on turn 48, if I eat it, it should be fine.\n> \n> Turn 47: I move to (2,4), then turn 48: move to (1,4) and eat.\n> \n> On turn 47, after moving to (2,4), the food at (1,4) still has life_span? After turn 47, life_span decreases to 3, so on turn 48, it has life_span 3, can be eaten.\n> \n> But is there any risk?\n> \n> Also, I need to consider the whole snake movement.\n> \n> After moving to (2,4) on turn 47, snake positions: head to (2,4), then the body: previous head was (3,4), which becomes body, so segments: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), tail (4,1).\n> \n> Tail is at (4,1), which will move to (5,1) or something?

So coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning I can't move to cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6). I need to avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (1,4), and the body segments are: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So the head is at (1,4), and the tail is at (5,1). The snake has 10 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left. So currently moving left.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life span 4. But life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 49, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns, so it will be gone by turn 53 if not eaten.\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 7. So disappears after turn 56.\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1 and life span 10. Disappears after turn 59.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a mental grid.\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So the tail is at (5,1).\n> \n> Food at (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied by the snake's body! Let's see: snake segments include (5,2), which is the 7th segment? Positions: index 0: (1,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,1), 9: (5,1). So (5,2) is occupied by segment 6.\n> \n> But food is at (5,2) with life span 4. How can that be? The rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So here, food is under the body at (5,2). To eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (5,2), and then later the head moves to (5,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,2) and (3,2) are free, I think. Let me check if they are occupied.\n> \n> (1,2): not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (3,2): not in snake positions, free.\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied, but food is there, so it's under the body.\n> \n> Now, head is at (1,4), moving left. Current direction is L, so from (1,4), moving left would go to (0,4), but x=0 is a wall, so I can't move left because it's a wall. Head direction is L, but I can choose to move in other directions, I think? No, the head direction indicates the current moving direction, but I can change direction, except no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so I cannot move right on the next turn, because that would be instant reverse. But I can move up, down, or left, but left is blocked by wall.\n> \n> Available moves from head position (1,4):\n> \n> - Up: (1,5) — y=5, is that within bounds? y from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=5 is fine, but I need to check if it's occupied or obstacle.\n> \n> (1,5): not in snake positions? Snake has y=4,3,2,1, so (1,5) is free? Also, obstacles: (1,3) is an obstacle, but (1,5) is not listed as obstacle. Obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So (1,3) is obstacle, but (1,5) is not, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, down: (1,3) — but (1,3) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> Left: (0,4) — x=0 is wall, cannot move.\n> \n> Right: (2,4) — but (2,4) is the second segment of the snake, so if I move right, head would go to (2,4), which is occupied by the body, so collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, from current position (1,4), with head direction L, possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (1,5) — seems free, no wall, no obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,4) is head, but when I move, the head moves, and body follows, so (2,4) is currently occupied, but after move, it will be different.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail end moves off, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> But for collision, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, from (1,4), moving to:\n> \n> - Up: (1,5) — what is at (1,5)? Not in snake positions, not wall (x=1, y=5, x from 1 to 6 is ok, y from 1 to 6? Walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls. So (1,5) has x=1, y=5, both not 0 or 7, so not wall. Obstacles: (1,3) is obstacle, but (1,5) not listed, so free. Snake: not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> - Down: (1,3) — (1,3) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there, death.\n> \n> - Left: (0,4) — x=0 is wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - Right: (2,4) — (2,4) is occupied by the second segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision with body, death. The tail is at (5,1), which is different.\n> \n> So only possible move is Up to (1,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Head direction is L, but since left is blocked, I have to choose another direction. But I can only choose directions that are not opposite to current, but up and down are not opposite to left; opposite would be right. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. I cannot move right, but since right is invalid anyway, it's fine.\n> \n> Available moves: I can move U, D, or L, but L and D are blocked, so only U is possible? D is to (1,3) which is obstacle, blocked. L to wall, blocked. R to body, blocked and also opposite direction, but since it's invalid anyway.\n> \n> So only possible action is U to (1,5).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> List all occupied cells.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n> \n> Food: (5,2) but under snake, (1,2), (3,2)\n> \n> From (1,4):\n> \n> - North/Up: (1,5) — x=1,y=5: not wall, not obstacle (obstacles are (1,3) etc, not (1,5)), not snake occupied? Snake has y=4,3,2,1, so (1,5) free. Yes.\n> \n> - South/Down: (1,3) — obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - West/Left: (0,4) — wall, blocked.\n> \n> - East/Right: (2,4) — occupied by snake body, segment at index 1, not tail, so collision if head moves there.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Up to (1,5).\n> \n> But the action is for turn 49, and I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, for the sequence, I need to provide actions for turn 49, 50, 51, etc., but since the state changes, I have to simulate based on actions.\n> \n> The answer should include an action sequence starting from turn 49, for at least 5 turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the sequence might be for multiple turns, but I need to specify actions for each turn.\n> \n> It says: \"Action Sequence (in order): Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n> \n> And t1=49, so I need to provide actions for turn 49, 50, 51, etc. But how many? It doesn't specify, but since I think 5+ ahead, probably at least 5 actions.\n> \n> But I have to decide based on the state.\n> \n> First, for turn 49, only possible move is U.\n> \n> So action for turn 49 must be U.\n> \n> Then, after moving U, new head position (1,5), and direction is now U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Snake positions: head moves to (1,5), then the body: the second segment was (2,4), but since head moved, the new body will be: head (1,5), then previous head (1,4) becomes first body segment, then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), and tail (5,1) moves off? When head moves, the tail end is removed.\n> \n> Snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move U to (1,5):\n> \n> New snake positions: head (1,5), then body: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1). Tail (5,1) is removed, so snake has 9 segments? Original 10 segments, after move, head new position, tail removed, so length same unless food eaten.\n> \n> No food eaten, since (1,5) has no food.\n> \n> Food positions: (5,2) has food but under body, (1,2), (3,2).\n> \n> (1,5) is not food, so no eat, length remains 10? After move, snake has one less segment because tail moves off, but if no food, length decreases? No.\n> \n> Rule: when you move, if you don't eat food, the tail moves off, so length stays the same. But initially snake has 10 segments. After move, head to new cell, each body segment to previous position, tail cell vacated. So new snake has head at new position, and body from index 0 to 8 of previous, so 9 segments.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: (1,4) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,1), 9: (5,1) tail.\n> \n> After move head to (1,5): new head (1,5), then body: previous head (1,4) now body segment 1, then (2,4) seg 2, (3,4) seg 3, (3,3) seg 4, (4,3) seg 5, (5,3) seg 6, (5,2) seg 7, (6,2) seg 8, and (6,1) seg 9? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions: head at (1,5), then:\n> \n> - Segment 1: previous head position (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: previous segment 1 position (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: previous segment 2 position (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: previous segment 3 position (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: previous segment 4 position (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: previous segment 5 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: previous segment 6 position (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 8: previous segment 7 position (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: previous segment 8 position (6,1)\n> \n> Previous segment 8 is (6,1), but (6,1) was position of index 8, which is (6,1), and tail was index 9 (5,1), which is removed. So new snake has segments: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1) — that's 10 positions? (1,5) head, then 9 body segments? Let's count: positions: 1. (1,5), 2. (1,4), 3. (2,4), 4. (3,4), 5. (3,3), 6. (4,3), 7. (5,3), 8. (5,2), 9. (6,2), 10. (6,1). Oh, (6,1) is the last, which was previously index 8, but now it's the tail. Previously index 8 was (6,1), index 9 was (5,1), so (5,1) is gone, and (6,1) is now the tail. So new snake: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1)] — 10 segments? (1,5) to (6,1) that's 10 cells. But when no food eaten, length should stay same, 10 segments. Yes.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Food: (5,2) has food under segment 8? New positions: (5,2) is segment 8, which is body, not head. Food at (5,2) is still under body.\n> \n> (1,2) and (3,2) food.\n> \n> Life span: for food at (5,2), life span was 4 at turn 49, after turn 49, it decreases, so at turn 50, life span 3.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 7 at t49, so t50:6, etc.\n> \n> Now, head at (1,5), direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Now, for turn 50, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,5):\n> \n> - Up: (1,6) — y=6, not wall? y=6, y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not 0 or 7, so ok. Check obstacles: obstacles include (3,6), but (1,6) not listed, so free. Snake: not occupied, so can move.\n> \n> - Down: (1,4) — now (1,4) is the first body segment. If I move down to (1,4), which is occupied by body, but it's the segment just behind head? In new positions, head at (1,5), body segment 1 at (1,4). So (1,4) is adjacent to head, but it's body, not tail. If I move down, head to (1,4), which is occupied, so collision, death. Cannot move to a body segment except tail.\n> \n> - Left: (0,5) — x=0 wall, cannot.\n> \n> - Right: (2,5) — not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake has positions with x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but y=5 only (1,5) head, so (2,5) free? Yes.\n> \n> Also, direction: current direction U, so opposite is D. I cannot move down, because it's opposite, but down is invalid anyway due to body. I can move up, right, or left, but left blocked.\n> \n> Available: U to (1,6), R to (2,5), D to (1,4) invalid, L to (0,5) invalid.\n> \n> So can move U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and survival.\n> \n> Food: (1,2) at (1,2), which is below, but I'm at (1,5), so I might go down later, but down is not possible now.\n> \n> (3,2) at (3,2)\n> \n> And (5,2) under body.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (6,1), which is near (5,2) food.\n> \n> But to eat (5,2), the body must move away first.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied by segment 8?

side of the grid to avoid immediate dead ends near walls and obstacles, ensuring long-term survival by positioning the snake to access the positive food at (3,2) after clearing body segments. The food at (5,2) is ignored due to its short remaining lifespan (disappears by turn 53) and inaccessibility, while the path to (1,2) is blocked by obstacles.\n",

It's turn 50, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,5), then body segments: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,2) with life span 3, value +1. But (5,2) is currently occupied by the snake's 8th segment? Let's see the snake positions: index 0 is head (1,5), 1: (1,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,2), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1). So (5,2) is the 7th segment? Positions list: index 0: head, so (1,5), index 1: (1,4), index 2: (2,4), index 3: (3,4), index 4: (3,3), index 5: (4,3), index 6: (5,3), index 7: (5,2), index 8: (6,2), index 9: (6,1). So (5,2) is position index 7, which is part of the body.\n> \n> But food at (5,2) is listed. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. Here, (5,2) is occupied by the snake, so this food is under the body and can be eaten only if that segment moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,2) with life span 6, value +1, and (3,2) with life span 9, value +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,2) it's 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including this turn. So at turn 50, life span 3: it will be there for turns 50, 51, 52, and disappear after turn 52 or at start of turn 53? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+L. For (5,2) at turn 50, life span 3, so present on turns 50, 51, 52, gone at turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 6, present turns 50 to 55, gone at 56.\n> \n> (3,2) life span 9, present turns 50 to 58, gone at 59.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,5), direction Up. From direction Up, possible moves: since no instant reverse, cannot go Down. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right? Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> Current position (1,5), moving Up would be to (1,6). But let's check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=7 is wall, y=6 is possible? Grid from y=0 to y=7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 or x=7.\n> \n> So (1,5): possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (1,6) - y=6, which is not 7, so should be ok, but need to check if it's a wall cell. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,6) is not a wall cell.\n> \n> - Down: (1,4) - but (1,4) is the body segment, and since head direction is Up, moving Down is reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so cannot move Down.\n> \n> - Left: (0,5) - but x=0 is wall, so cannot move Left.\n> \n> - Right: (2,5) - x=2, not 0 or 7, should be ok.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (1,3) is an obstacle, but we're at (1,5), so not immediate.\n> \n> So from (1,5), possible moves: Up to (1,6), or Right to (2,5). Cannot go Down or Left.\n> \n> Now, need to think about food and plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for visualization.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1). So tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Food: (5,2) - but this is currently occupied by snake segment at (5,2), which is index 7.\n> \n> (1,2) and (3,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is under the snake, so to eat it, we need the snake to move so that the segment at (5,2) moves away, and then head moves to (5,2).\n> \n> Currently, at turn 50, the segment at (5,2) is part of the body. When the snake moves, the tail will move, but let's see the movement.\n> \n> In each turn, the head moves to a new position, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can be eaten only if head moves there after the body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (5,2) has food, but it's occupied. So to eat it, we need that cell to be free when head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 50, positions include (5,2). When we move on turn 50, the head moves to a new position, say to (1,6) or (2,5), then the body segments follow: the segment at (1,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail end is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell with food, snake grows, so tail stays, and new head position, body segments shift.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves, body shifts, tail is removed.\n> \n> But for food under body: the food is at (5,2), which is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position based on the movement direction.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 50, we move Up to (1,6).\n> \n> Then new head position: (1,6)\n> \n> Then body segments: the first body segment (index 1, (1,4)) moves to where head was, (1,5). Then index 2 (2,4) moves to where index 1 was, (1,4)? No.\n> \n> Positions: after head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> Initial positions: [ (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1) ]\n> \n> If head moves to (1,6), then new positions: head at (1,6), then body: segment that was at (1,4) moves to (1,5) (previous head), segment that was at (2,4) moves to (1,4) (previous position of first body segment), and so on.\n> \n> Generally: new head position, then for i from 1 to len-1, new position i is old position i-1.\n> \n> So after move to (1,6):\n> \n> New positions: head: (1,6)\n> \n> Then body: (1,5)  // old head\n> \n> Then (1,4)  // old (1,4)?

It's turn 51, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so snake can only be in cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? Not necessarily, because snake positions include (2,5), (1,5), etc., and (1,5) has x=1, which is not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Let's confirm: walls are border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. So the inner grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). Yes.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)]. So these cells are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2). So the snake is 10 segments long.

(5,2), (6,2). (5,2) is the second last segment, and (6,2) is the tail. Food at (5,2): value 1, life span 2. But the snake is on (5,2), so according to the rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,2) with value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> And (3,2) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> All foods have value 1, so all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,2), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,2), life span 2 at turn 51.

It's turn 52, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and some internal obstacles.\n> \n> **Walls**: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and moving to any of these border coordinates is a wall collision. Also, internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). I need to avoid these.\n> \n> **Snake Positions**: Head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). So the tail is at (5,2). The head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> **Food**:\n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life span 1. But (5,2) is the tail position! The snake is currently on (5,2) for the tail. So this food is under the snake's body, specifically the tail.\n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 4\n> - (3,2) with value 1 and life span 7\n> - (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, the food at (5,2) is under the tail. To eat it, the body must move away, and then the head moves onto it. But since it's the tail, when the snake moves, the tail will move, so if the head moves to (5,2) after the tail leaves, it could be eaten. But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, the head is at (3,5), tail at (5,2). Are they adjacent? Let's see the positions: (3,5) to (5,2) – difference in x is 2, y is 3, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, like |dx| + |dy| = 1.\n> \n> (3,5) and (5,2): |3-5| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5, which is greater than 1, so not adjacent. Therefore, eating the food at (5,2) might be possible if we can get to it after the tail moves.\n> \n> But the life span of that food is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn, including current turn? \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,2), life_span=1, meaning at the end of turn 52, it will disappear. Since we're at turn 52, if we don't eat it this turn, it's gone. But to eat it, the head needs to move to (5,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (5,2). When the snake moves, the tail will move only if the head moves and the snake grows or not. Since eating food increases length, but not eating keeps length same.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves:\n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves away from current tail position.\n> - If food eaten, head moves to food position, tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> But for food under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away first.\n> \n> Here, food at (5,2) is under tail. At turn 52, if we move the head, the tail will move only if we don't eat food this turn.\n> \n> Let me denote the current state: turn 52.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), tail (5,2). So 10 segments? Let's count: indices 0 to 9: 0:(3,5), 1:(2,5), 2:(1,5), 3:(1,4), 4:(2,4), 5:(3,4), 6:(3,3), 7:(4,3), 8:(5,3), 9:(5,2). Yes, 10 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so moving right, meaning last move was to increase x.\n> \n> Possible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse: since head direction is R, I cannot move L (left) on this turn, because that would be opposite direction. So allowed moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it's reverse.\n> \n> Current head at (3,5). Moving:\n> \n> - U: (3,6)\n> \n> - D: (3,4)\n> \n> - R: (4,5)\n> \n> - L: not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (3,6): is this a wall? Internal obstacles include (3,6), which is a wall. So (3,6) is occupied by wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - (3,4): this is a body segment, position index 5: (3,4). So moving to (3,4) would be body collision, deadly.\n> \n> - (4,5): what is here? Looking at snake positions, (4,5) is not listed. Snake has (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), so (4,5) is empty? Also, walls: x=4,y=5, not a border or internal obstacle listed. Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (4,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it free? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So (4,5) is not in snake, not wall, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is wall, cannot go.\n> \n> (3,4) is body, cannot go.\n> \n> So only possible move at turn 52 is R to (4,5).\n> \n> Is that right? U to (3,6) is wall, D to (3,4) is body, L not allowed, R to (4,5) free.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So for turn 52, I must move R to (4,5).\n> \n> But let's confirm the food situation.\n> \n> Food at (5,2) has life span 1, so after turn 52, it disappears. Since we're moving to (4,5), not eating any food this turn, so the tail at (5,2) will move away. Specifically, since no food eaten, the head moves to (4,5), and the tail moves away from (5,2). The new tail position depends on the movement; since the snake moves, the segment that was at (5,2) will not be there anymore after the move.\n> \n> After moving to (4,5), the new snake positions: head at (4,5), then the previous head (3,5) becomes second segment, and so on, up to (5,3) becomes the new tail? Let's trace.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2) ]\n> \n> After move R to (4,5): head moves to (4,5), then the body segments shift: the first body segment takes (3,5), which was head, then (2,5) to (2,5), no: the segments move: the new head is (4,5), then the segment that was at index 0 (old head) is now at index 1, so (3,5) becomes body, index 1: (3,5), then index 2: (2,5), index 3: (1,5), index 4: (1,4), index 5: (2,4), index 6: (3,4), index 7: (3,3), index 8: (4,3), index 9: (5,3).

Yes, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Food at (5,2) was under tail, but tail moved to (5,3), so (5,2) is now empty?

(5,6) is a wall, but (5,5) is not listed, so not a wall. Snake body: positions are (3,5), (2,5), etc. (5,5) is not in snake positions, so empty? Let's list all snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (5,5) is free? (5,5) is not occupied by snake or wall, so should be safe to move, unless it causes collision later, but for immediate move, it's ok.\n> \n> Moving to (5,5): after move, head moves to (5,5), and tail moves away from (5,3), so the body segments shift. When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed. So after moving to (5,5), the new snake positions would be: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). Tail was (5,3), which is now gone, so (4,3) is the new tail? Let's index: old positions: index 0 head (4,5), 1 (3,5), 2 (2,5), 3 (1,5), 4 (1,4), 5 (2,4), 6 (3,4), 7 (3,3), 8 (4,3), 9 (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving right to (5,5), new head is (5,5), then body: old head becomes segment 1, so (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). The last segment (5,3) is gone, so new tail is (4,3). Snake has 10 segments, after move, it still has 10 segments unless it eats food. Since no food at (5,5), length unchanged, so tail is removed, new positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). Yes, tail at (4,3).\n> \n> But (5,5) is empty, so no collision.\n> \n> Now, move U to (4,6): (4,6) is it wall? y=6, not 0 or 7, x=4 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is wall, but (4,6) is not listed, so not wall. Snake positions: is (4,6) occupied? No, so should be ok.\n> \n> Move D to (4,4): (4,4) not wall, not snake, ok.\n> \n> But move L to (3,5) is not allowed because reverse, and (3,5) is body, but since reverse not allowed, we don't consider it.\n> \n> (3,5) is the first body segment, but moving left would go to (3,5), which is occupied, but since reverse not allowed, we skip.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (1,2), (3,2), (5,4)\n> \n> (5,4) is at (5,4), which is close to head (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) to (5,4) is not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (4,6) U, (4,4) D, (3,5) L, (5,5) R.\n> \n> (5,4) is down-right from (4,5), but not adjacent; from (4,5), adjacent are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5).\n> \n> (5,4) is diagonal, not directly reachable in one move. To reach (5,4), I need to go to (5,5) or (4,4) first, but (5,4) is below (5,5) or right of (4,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is at (3,2), which is down-left from head, but not adjacent.\n> \n> (1,2) is further.\n> \n> Life spans: (1,2) has life 4, so it will disappear after turn 53+4-1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn t, life span is L, then after this turn, it becomes L-1 for next turn. When L=1, after this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> For (1,2): life span 4 at turn 53. So:\n> \n> After turn 53, life span becomes 3 (for turn 54)\n> \n> After turn 54, life span 2\n> \n> After turn 55, life span 1\n> \n> After turn 56, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 57? Let's see.\n> \n> Typically: at start of turn, life span is current value. After the turn, it decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (x,y) with life span L at turn t:\n> \n> - It can be eaten on turns where L >=1\n> \n> - After being eaten or after L becomes 0, it's gone.\n> \n> For (1,2): L=4 at turn 53. So it can be eaten on turns 53,54,55,56. After turn 56, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): L=6, can be eaten turns 53 to 58.\n> \n> (5,4): L=9, turns 53 to 61.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns ahead. So for turns 53,54,55,56,57 at least.\n> \n> Current turn 53, so actions for turn 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, etc.\n> \n> But I need to output an action sequence starting from turn 53.\n> \n> Also, think about the grid to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Walls: all border, so:\n> \n> - Left: x=0, y=0 to 7\n> \n> - Right: x=7, y=0 to 7\n> \n> - Bottom: y=0, x=0 to 7\n> \n> - Top: y=7, x=0 to 7\n> \n> Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) are walls, and (2,1), (3,6), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake occupies: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Now, available food: (1,2), (3,2), (5,4)\n> \n> (1,2) is at (1,2), which is below (1,3) and (1,4), but (1,3) is wall, (1,4) is snake body.\n> \n> (1,4) is part of snake, index 4 or something.\n> \n> To eat (1,2), I need to move head to (1,2) when it's not occupied by body.\n> \n> Currently, (1,2) is empty, but to reach it, I need to go through (1,3) or (2,2), but (1,3) is wall, so I cannot go to (1,3).\n> \n> Access to (1,2): adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2).\n> \n> But (1,3) is wall, (0,2) is border wall, so only (1,1) and (2,2) are possible, but (1,1) is border? y=1 not 0, x=1 not 0, but (1,1) is not border? Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

It's turn 54, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (1,1) to (6,6) for playable cells, I think. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) are all possible, but the borders are walls, so snake can only be in (1,1) to (6,6), I believe. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls include border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So snake cannot move to these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. Since head is at (4,4) and direction is D, that means it moved down to (4,4) from (4,5)? Positions are head first: (4,4) is head, then (4,5), which is above it? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,5)  // directly above head? y=5 is above y=4? Usually in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U is y+1, that means y increases as we go up, I assume. Standard is often y=0 at bottom, but here it might be different. U: (x,y+1) means moving up increases y, so y=0 is bottom? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall, then U (y+1) moves towards higher y, which is up, towards y=7.\n> \n> Similarly, D (y-1) moves down towards y=0.\n> \n> In snake positions: head at (4,4), next segment (4,5). Since (4,5) has higher y, it's above (4,4). But head direction is D, which is down, towards decreasing y. So if head is at (4,4) and moving down, it came from (4,5)? Positions: [(4,4), (4,5), ...] so (4,4) is head, (4,5) is the first body segment. Since direction is D (down), that means the head was at (4,5) on previous turn and moved down to (4,4), so the body follows.\n> \n> Current head position is (4,4), direction is D, so last move was down to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn? The description says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (1,2), life span 3 at turn 54, so it will disappear after turn 56? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 54, life span is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including this one. After turn 54, it has 2 left; after turn 55, 1 left; after turn 56, it disappears, so it can be eaten on turns 54, 55, or 56.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): life span 5 at turn 54, so disappears after turn 58.\n> \n> (5,4): life span 8, disappears after turn 61.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food has life spans, I should consider when they expire.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid collisions and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So list of blocked cells:\n> \n> - All border cells: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x.\n> \n> - Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (2,1) is on the border? y=1, but x=2, y=1 is not a border wall unless y=0 or y=7. Walls are only at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are not borders, similarly x=1 to x=6 not borders except where obstacles. Border walls are the lines, not the cells? \"Cells occupied by walls\" : border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell. So for example, (0,1) is wall, (1,0) is wall, etc.\n> \n> But for playable area, cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6 are free, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (3,6): x=3,y=6\n> \n> (2,1): x=2,y=1\n> \n> (1,3): x=1,y=3\n> \n> (2,3): x=2,y=3\n> \n> (5,6): x=5,y=6\n> \n> y=6 is not border, since border is y=7, so y=6 is playable except obstacles.\n> \n> Now snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Head: (4,4)\n> \n> Body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> So the snake is on: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> From head to tail: (4,4) head, then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2), (3,2), (5,4)\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so last move was down to (4,4).\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (4,4):\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by the body, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (4,3) but (4,3) is the tail? (4,3) is a body segment, but it's the tail. When we move, the tail will move away, so moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, as long as it's not a body segment at that moment.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail position is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> But (4,3) is the current tail position. If head moves to (4,3), and tail moves to the next, but the cell (4,3) will be occupied by head, and tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, body collision only if head touches a body segment that doesn't move away.\n> \n> In this case, (4,3) is tail, so moving to it is safe.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) = (3,4) but (3,4) is occupied by body, segment before tail? Positions: (3,4) is the 8th segment? Let's index.\n> \n> Snake segments: 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4), 6: (2,4), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> So (3,4) is segment 7, not tail. Tail is (4,3).\n> \n> If head moves to (3,4), which is occupied by segment 7, but when head moves, the body will also move, but segment 7 is at (3,4) now, and if head moves to (3,4), it would be on the same cell before the body moves, so collision.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment. But when moving, the head moves first, then body follows. So if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment (except tail), it collides because that segment is still there.\n> \n> Only for tail, it moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Here, (3,4) is not tail; tail is (4,3). So moving to (3,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) = (5,4)\n> \n> (5,4) has food, but let's see if it's free.\n> \n> Food at (5,4), and it's a cell. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). No (5,4), so (5,4) is free, and has food.\n> \n> Also, is it a wall? x=5, y=4, between 1 and 6, not border, and not internal obstacle listed: obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), not (5,4), so (5,4) is free and has food.\n> \n> D: (4,3) is tail, so can move there.\n> \n> U: (4,5) is body segment 1, so cannot move there.\n> \n> L: (3,4) is body segment 7, cannot move there.\n> \n> R: (5,4) is free, with food.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,4) with direction D:\n> \n> - D: to (4,3) - tail, safe\n> \n> - R: to (5,4) - free, with food\n> \n> U and L are invalid due to collision.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: current direction is D, so opposite is U, which we cannot do anyway since it's blocked. But even if it were free, we couldn't move opposite.\n> \n> Here U is blocked, so only D and R are possible.\n> \n> D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, if we move R to (5,4), we eat the food at (5,4), since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake grows, new tail is added or something. When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays, meaning after moving head to food, the body follows but tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when eaten, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In terms of movement: if head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, so the segment that was tail remains, and head is on new position.\n> \n> If not, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, length same.\n> \n> Now, for (5,4), if we move there, we eat it, grow to 11 segments.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, current head (4,4), tail (4,3). Are they adjacent? (4,4) and (4,3) are adjacent vertically, since y differs by 1.\n> \n> x same, y=4 and y=3, so yes, adjacent.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (4,3), but is there food on tail? Food positions are (1,2), (3,2), (5,4), not on (4,3). (4,3) is tail, no food there. So no danger.\n> \n> The danger is only if tail cell has food, and head is adjacent to tail, then if head moves to tail to eat, but since tail has food, eating it would grow, so head is on that cell, and the new tail is where the old tail was, but since head was adjacent, after eating, the head is on the food cell, which was tail, and the body includes the previous segments, so if head was adjacent, after moving to tail/food, the head is there, and the segment that was behind head is now adjacent, but it might cause collision if not careful.\n> \n> Specifically: suppose head is at A, tail at B, and B has food. Head moves to B to eat. After eating, head is at B, and the new tail is added, so the segment that was tail stays, but since head moved to B, and B was tail, now head is at B, and the body has the previous position, so the segment that was adjacent to head (say position C) is now next to head at B. If C is adjacent to B, then after head moves to B, and the body doesn't move since we ate, so the segment at C is still there, and if C is adjacent to B, head is at B, so they are adjacent but not colliding yet? Collision if head touches body, so if C is adjacent to B, and head is at B, they are not on same cell, so no collision. Only if head moves to a cell occupied by body.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to B, which was tail, but tail is moving away only if we don't eat. If we eat, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, head moves to food, body follows but tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions: before move, head at H, body segments, tail at T.\n> \n> If head moves to a food cell F, then after move: head is at F, body segments shift: segment 1 moves to H, segment 2 to old pos of seg1, ..., tail stays at its position, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Typically, when snake grows, after moving head to food, all body segments move except the tail doesn't advance; instead, the tail remains, and a new segment is effectively added. But in terms of positions, the tail cell doesn't change; we keep the tail where it is for that turn.\n> \n> For example: suppose snake length L, positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1} (tail).\n> \n> Head moves to new position N.\n> \n> If N is food, then new head is N, and body: P0 becomes segment 1, P1 becomes segment 2, ..., P_{L-2} becomes segment L-1, and P_{L-1} (tail) remains tail, so positions: N, P0, P1, ..., P_{L-1}, so length L+1.\n> \n> If not food, then new head N, body: P0, P1, ..., P_{L-2}, and tail moves to P_{L-2}? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - If no food eaten, tail segment is removed from old position.\n> \n> - If food eaten, tail segment stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> - New head position: move to adjacent cell.\n> \n> - Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> - After all segments moved, if food was eaten, the last segment (tail) does not move, so it stays, effectively adding a segment.\n> \n> - If no food eaten, the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In the case where head moves to a cell that was occupied by tail: only possible if tail is adjacent and we move to it.\n> \n> If we move to tail and eat food there, but tail has food only if food spawned under it.\n> \n> In this state, no food on tail.\n> \n> Back to possible moves.\n> \n> From (4,4), can move:\n> \n> - D to (4,3): which is current tail. If we move there, and (4,3) has no food (no food listed there), so we don't eat, so after move, head moves to (4,3), then body: segment 1 (was at (4,5)) moves to (4,4), segment 2 ( (3,5) ) moves to (4,5)?

This sets up the snake to eat the positive food at (3,2) in the next turn, which has a limited lifespan and is a high-priority target. \n\nHere’s the reasoning summarized:\n1. **Current State**: Snake head at (4,3), direction Down (D). Possible moves: D, L, or R (cannot reverse to U).\n2. **Food Priorities**: \n   - (3,2) has a lifespan of 4 (will disappear after turn 58), so it must be eaten soon. \n   - (1,2) is unreachable before it disappears.\n   - (5,4) and (3,1) have longer lifespans and can be targeted later.\n3. **Move Selection**:\n   - **D (to (4,2))**: Best choice to set up eating (3,2) next turn. Safe (no collisions) and leaves (3,3) free for future flexibility.\n   - L (to (3,3)): Also viable but less optimal for long-term space.\n   - R (to (5,3)): Takes the snake away from high-priority food.\n4. **Sequence**: After moving D at \\( t_0 = 55 \\), the next steps will be:\n   - Turn 56: L to (3,2) to eat the food.\n   - Turn 57: D to (3,1) to eat another food.\n   - Subsequent moves right to avoid trapping.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells go from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. But the snake and food positions are given, so I need to see where they are.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So head is at (4,3), and tail is at (3,3). Let's list the segments:\n> \n> - Head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Then: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — that's 10 segments, so length 10.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down, meaning moving down. But head is at (4,3), and direction is D, so it was moving down to (4,3)? Let's see the positions: from (4,4) to (4,3) would be down? y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom?\n> \n> I need to clarify the coordinate system. The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U is y+1, that probably means y increases upwards, so U is up, D is down. But let's confirm with snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,3), previous was (4,4) since it's the second segment. Positions are head first, so [ (4,3), (4,4), ... ] so head at (4,3), and next is (4,4), which has higher y, so if y increases, (4,4) is above (4,3)? Direction is D, down.\n> \n> If head is at (4,3) and direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (4,3) from the previous position. Previous head was at (4,4) I think? Positions list is current: head (4,3), then body segments. So before moving, head was at (4,4), it moved down to (4,3), so now direction is D.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U would go to (x,y+1), which might be north if y increases up.\n> \n> But in terms of grid, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is probably bottom or top? It doesn't matter, as long as I use the directions consistently.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)]\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 2 (since (x,y, life_span, value) I think? The input is (x1,y1, value1, life_span1) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see: \" (1, 2, 2, 1) \" — it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the text it's written as (1,2,2,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value). I need to parse.\n> \n> In the state: \" (1, 2, 2, 1) \" and it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (x1,y1, value1, life_span1)\" no, look: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the text it's written without parentheses for each, but it says \" (1, 2, 2, 1) \" which is likely (x,y, life_span, value) or what?\n> \n> Read carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 2, 2, 1)\" and the description says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but here it's four numbers. Probably it's (x, y, life_span, value).\n> \n> Similarly, others: (3,2,4,1), (5,4,7,1), (3,1,10,1)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Food at (1,2): life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2): life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> - (5,4): life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> - (3,1): life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> All positive food, no negative mentioned, so all are +1.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 55, life_span=2 means it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life_span is the remaining life, I think.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at current turn t=55, for food at (1,2) with life_span=2, it will disappear after turn 56? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 55, life_span=2, after turn 55, it decreases to 1, then after turn 56, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 55 or 56, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, others: (3,2) life_span=4, so disappears after turn 58 (since t55, t56, t57, t58: after t58 it should be gone, so last chance to eat is t58).\n> \n> Countdown: at turn t, life_span L, after the turn, it becomes L-1. When L=0, after that turn it disappears. So if L=2 at turn 55, after turn 55, L=1; after turn 56, L=0, and it disappears, so can be eaten on turn 55 or 56.\n> \n> Similarly, L=4 at t55, after t55 L=3, after t56 L=2, after t57 L=1, after t58 L=0 and disappears, so can be eaten up to turn 58.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), direction D (down).

It's turn 56. The grid has walls: border cells from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the edges. Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6). So I should avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then body segments at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So the snake is 10 cells long. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1), so moving downward.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake: head at (4,2), direction down. So from (4,2), moving down would go to (4,1), but let's see what's around.\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (4,2) with head direction down (D). Since head direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U (because no instant reverse). Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,3) – but (4,3) is occupied by the snake body (second segment). So moving up would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,1) – is this within bounds? y=1, x=4. Walls: y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not border wall? Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is not wall. Also, check internal obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) is not listed, so should be free? But let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So (4,1) has no obstacle mentioned, and not a border wall, so should be empty.\n> \n> - Left (L): (3,2) – (3,2) has food, but let's see if it's free. Food is at (3,2), but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: from (4,2) head, then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So (3,2) is not in snake body, and no obstacle, so should be free except for food.\n> \n> - Right (R): (5,2) – not in snake body, no obstacle, free? Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (5,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,2) is available, life span 3, so it will be there for a few turns.\n> \n> But first, I need to choose an action for turn 56.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,2) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> But to eat (1,2), I need to move left twice or something, but from (4,2), moving left once to (3,2), then if I move left again to (2,2), but (1,2) is not adjacent directly.\n> \n> From (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (4,1)\n> \n> - L: to (3,2) which has food\n> \n> - R: to (5,2)\n> \n> U is invalid because body at (4,3), and also reverse not allowed?

No food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> (5,2): empty, no food.\n> \n> (3,2): has food with value 1.\n> \n> If I move to (3,2), I eat the food, snake grows to 11 segments.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (1,2) with life span 1, so only this turn to eat it or it's gone.\n> \n> (1,2) is at x=1,y=2.\n> \n> Current head at (4,2), so to reach (1,2) in one turn? Not possible; only adjacent moves.\n> \n> From (4,2), I can only move to adjacent cells: (4,1), (3,2), (5,2). (1,2) is not adjacent; it's two left and same y, so not reachable directly.\n> \n> To eat (1,2) on turn 56, I need to be at (1,2) or adjacent and move to it, but since I'm at (4,2), I can't move to (1,2) directly. So impossible to eat (1,2) on this turn. It will disappear after this turn since life span 1 decreases to 0.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (1,2), life span 1, at turn 56, after this turn (turn 56), countdown decreases to 0 and disappears. So if not eaten on turn 56, it's gone.\n> \n> But since I can't reach it from (4,2) in one move, I can't eat it this turn. So it will be gone after this turn. No point in considering it further.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (3,2) life span 3, so after turn 56, it has 2 turns left? Let's clarify.\n> \n> At turn t1=56, food has life span L. After turn t1, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (1,2): life span 1 at turn 56. After turn 56, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> For (3,2): life span 3 at turn 56. After turn 56, life span 2; after turn 57, life span 1; after turn 58, life span 0 and disappears if not eaten by then.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life span 6, (3,1) life span 9.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (4,2), possible actions: D, L, or R.\n> \n> U is invalid because body at (4,3) and also reverse direction not allowed.\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each move.\n> \n> First, move down to (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is empty, no food. After moving, snake head at (4,1), direction D. Body moves, tail moves away from (3,4) to (2,4)?

The tail was at (3,4), and since no tail movement, the snake now has positions: new head (3,1), then previous head (3,2) becomes second segment, and so on, up to (3,4) still there, and since length increased, (3,4) remains, and a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> When head moves to food:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell (with food)\n> \n> - Food is eaten\n> \n> - Since positive food, tail does not move, so the body from second segment to tail remains, but the tail position stays, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head is at new position, and the previous head is now body, and all body segments stay, tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> So initial positions: S0, S1, S2, ..., S10 where S0=head (3,2), S1=(4,2), ..., S10=tail (3,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,1) and eating food:\n> \n> New head: (3,1)\n> \n> Then, the body: S0 becomes new segment 1: (3,2), S1 becomes segment 2: (4,2), S2: (4,3), ..., up to S10: (3,4) is now segment 11?

No, in the list, (3,4) is the last, so tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Before, tail was (3,4), after growth, tail is still at (3,4), but the snake is longer because we added a new head position, and the tail didn't move, so all positions shift, but tail cell remains until next move without food.\n> \n> In this case, after move, tail is at (3,4), head at (3,1).\n> \n> Distance between head and tail is (3,1) to (3,4), which is |dy|=3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> No immediate danger.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,4) with life span 6, so it will disappear in 6 turns if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 57, life span 6, so after turn 57, if not eaten, life span becomes 5, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1), life span 8.\n> \n> Since (3,1) is close, I might eat it now, but let's see options.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 57:\n> \n> - U to (3,3)\n> \n> - D to (3,1)  // eat food\n> \n> - L to (2,2)\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each.\n> \n> First, if I move D to (3,1), eat food, score +1, snake grows to 12 segments.

So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive? x=0 to x=7 means 8 cells wide (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7), similarly for y. So it's an 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then body segments: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4).

But the head is at (3,1) and moving down would be to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't move down directly. Head direction is D, but since it's at (3,1), moving down to (3,0) would hit the wall, but the current state is before movement, I think.

Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), so (4,1) not in that list. And not occupied by snake, since snake has (4,2) etc., but not (4,1). So (4,1) is free?

It's turn 59. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,1), and the body segments follow: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). That's 12 segments, so the snake is length 12.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which means right, so last move was to the right to (4,1). Since head is at (4,1) and direction is R, it came from left, so previous position was (3,1), but (3,1) is the second segment, which matches.\n> \n> Food positions: two foods given.\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive foods since value is +1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So, plan a sequence of actions for turns 59, 60, 61, etc., but since the food has life spans, I need to consider when they disappear.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) disappears after 4 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 59 + 4 = 63? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 59, life span is 4, so it decreases to 3 on turn 60, 2 on 61, 1 on 62, and gone on turn 63. Similarly, (2,6) has life span 9, so it will be around for a while.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,1), direction R. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left immediately. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Similarly, (2,6) not occupied.\n> \n> Now, for turn 59, head at (4,1), direction R. Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,1) head, (3,1) next, then (3,2), then (4,2). (4,2) is the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: (4,1) head, index 1: (3,1), index 2: (3,2), index 3: (4,2), index 4: (4,3), etc.\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied by the snake body. Moving to (4,2) would cause collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, D: down to (4,0). But y=0 is wall, so moving to (4,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> R: right to (5,1). Is (5,1) valid? x=5, y=1. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x=5 is not border, y=1 not border. Internal obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6). (5,1) not in obstacles. Snake positions: (5,1) not in snake, so should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm snake positions: all positions are listed, (5,1) not there.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R but U to (4,2) is body, D to (4,0) is wall, so only R to (5,1) is possible?\n> \n> U: (4,1) up to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by snake body segment at index 3.\n> \n> D: (4,1) down to (4,0), y=0 is wall.\n> \n> L: left to (3,1), but (3,1) is the second segment, and also opposite direction, since current direction is R, moving L is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> R: right to (5,1), which seems free.\n> \n> Is (5,1) within bounds? x=5, y=1, min x=0, max x=7, min y=0, max y=7, so (5,1) is on grid, not wall, not obstacle, not snake body? Snake body: positions are (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), etc., no (5,1), so yes, (5,1) is empty.\n> \n> But let's list all occupied cells: snake occupies: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)\n> \n> Walls: borders and (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (2,1) is an internal obstacle, which is a wall, so (2,1) is occupied by wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6) are walls.\n> \n> For (5,1): x=5, y=1, not border, not in internal obstacles, not snake, so free.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move at turn 59 is R to (5,1).\n> \n> But is that right? What about U and D? U to (4,2) is snake body, D to (4,0) is wall, L not allowed, so yes, only R.\n> \n> But let me double-check the snake positions. Head (4,1), moving up to (4,2): (4,2) is part of the body, specifically the fourth segment. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves, so if I move to (4,2), which is currently occupied, but after move, the tail will move away, but in terms of collision, it's the head touching a body segment that isn't the tail at that moment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is not the tail; the tail is (2,4). (4,2) is somewhere in the middle. So moving to (4,2) would cause collision because it's touching a body segment that isn't the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is free, so moving there is safe.\n> \n> D to (4,0) is wall.\n> \n> So for turn 59, only possible action is R to (5,1).\n> \n> Then, after moving, head is at (5,1), and direction is now R, since we moved right.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,4) with life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, so by turn 63 it's gone. Since we're at turn 59, it has life span 4, so it will be there for turns 59,60,61,62, gone on 63.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has life span 9, so many turns.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (5,1), head at (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) but y=0 wall, L to (4,1) but (4,1) is now the second segment? After move, snake positions: head moves to (5,1), then body: previous head (4,1) becomes first body segment, then (3,1), (3,2), etc., and tail (2,4) moves? Let's think snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves right to (5,1), new head is (5,1), then the body segments follow: the segment that was at (4,1) is now at the position where head was, but since head moved, the body shifts. Positions: old positions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ]\n> \n> After moving right: head to (5,1), then the body: the first body segment goes to (4,1), which was the old head position, then (3,1) goes to where (3,1) was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,1), then the segment that was at index 1 (3,1) moves to where head was, (4,1)? Indices: let’s say positions list: index 0: head, index 1: neck, etc.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,1), then the segment that was index 0 is now at index 1, but position: it moves to the new position based on the move.\n> \n> Typically, the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (5,1): new head (5,1), then the body segments are: (4,1) now at index 1, (3,1) at index 2? Positions: the segment that was at position (4,1) is now at the position of the old head? No.\n> \n> Let's think: the snake was at positions S = [P0, P1, P2, ..., P11] where P0 = (4,1), P1 = (3,1), P2 = (3,2), P3 = (4,2), etc. up to P11 = (2,4)\n> \n> After moving to a new position Q, the new snake is [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P10] because the tail P11 is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head Q = (5,1), then P0 = (4,1), then P1 = (3,1), P2 = (3,2), P3 = (4,2), P4 = (4,3), P5 = (4,4), P6 = (4,5), P7 = (3,5), P8 = (2,5), P9 = (1,5), P10 = (1,4). P11 (2,4) is gone.\n> \n> The body segments are from index 1 to 11: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Now, for turn 60, head at (5,1), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite L not allowed.\n> \n> U to (5,2): is (5,2) free? Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (5,2) not. Snake positions: (5,2) not in new snake positions. New snake: (5,1) head, (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), etc. (5,2) not there, so free.\n> \n> D to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (4,1): (4,1) is now the first body segment, so moving left to (4,1) would be collision with body, and also opposite direction, but opposite not allowed anyway.\n> \n> R to (6,1): x=6, y=1, not border, not obstacle, not snake?

(5,4) is free.\n> \n> Food can be eaten if head moves onto it.\n> \n> But there's a rule: if food is under body, it can only be eaten when body moves away and head moves in.

So for (4,5), it's occupied by the snake now, so to eat it, the snake needs to move so that (4,5) is free, then head moves there. But life span is 9, so it might be possible.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is not occupied by snake, I think. Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> So (5,4) is not in this list, so it's free. (2,6) is not in list, free. (4,5) is occupied by snake.\n> \n> Now, head is at (6,2) and direction is Up. From the positions, it was at (6,1) before, moved up to (6,2), so direction U is consistent.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,2): Up to (6,3), Down to (6,1) but (6,1) is the neck, so moving down would cause collision? No, because when I move, the tail moves, so it might be ok. Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Movement: when I move, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed. So if I move down to (6,1), which is currently occupied by the neck, but after move, that cell will be the new head position, and the old head becomes part of body, but since the snake moves, (6,1) will be vacated when the segment moves forward.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is left.\n> \n> So from positions: head (6,2), next is (6,1), then (5,1), etc.\n> \n> If I move Up to (6,3), new head is (6,3), body: (6,2) becomes first body, then (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (2,5) but tail (2,5) is removed? Positions: current snake has 12 segments. After move, if I don't eat food, length same, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move Down to (6,1): (6,1) is currently occupied, but after move, head moves to (6,1), which was the neck, but now it's head, and the old head (6,2) becomes part of body. But (6,1) was occupied by the second segment, which moves to where the first segment was, but it's shifting.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> Current positions: [H: (6,2), B1: (6,1), B2: (5,1), B3: (4,1), B4: (3,1), B5: (3,2), B6: (4,2), B7: (4,3), B8: (4,4), B9: (4,5), B10: (3,5), T: (2,5)]\n> \n> If I move Down to (6,1): new head is (6,1). Then, B1 moves to old head position (6,2), B2 moves to (6,1) but (6,1) is now head? No.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,1) — but (6,1) was B1, so B1 position is now taken by head? Confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: the new head is at the new cell. Then the first body segment goes to where head was, second to where first was, and so on, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> So if move Down to (6,1): new head at (6,1). But (6,1) was occupied by B1. After move, B1 will move to (6,2), which was head. Then B2 moves to (5,1) position? Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,1)  (new position)\n> \n> - Then body: segment that was head is now at (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment that was B1 is now at (6,1)? No.\n> \n> The positions shift: the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 for i>0, and head goes to new cell.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (6,1)\n> \n> - New body segment 1: position of old head (6,2)\n> \n> - New body segment 2: position of old B1 (6,1) — but (6,1) is the new head, so it's occupied? No, the positions are the cells.\n> \n> Cells: after move down:\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,1)\n> \n> - The cell (6,2) now has the segment that was head, so it's body\n> \n> - The cell that had B1 (6,1) is now empty because B1 moves to (6,2)? Let's think of the snake as a list.\n> \n> Current list: [ (6,2) head, (6,1) B1, (5,1) B2, (4,1) B3, (3,1) B4, (3,2) B5, (4,2) B6, (4,3) B7, (4,4) B8, (4,5) B9, (3,5) B10, (2,5) tail ]\n> \n> After moving Down to (6,1):\n> \n> - New head: (6,1)  (since moving down from (6,2) to (6,1))\n> \n> - Then the new body segments:\n> \n> - The old head (6,2) becomes the first body segment\n> \n> - Then old B1 (6,1) becomes the second body segment, but it moves to where the old head was, which is (6,2)\n> \n> - Similarly, old B2 (5,1) becomes third body segment at position of old B1 (6,1)\n> \n> - And so on, up to old B10 (3,5) becomes the eleventh body segment at position of old B9 (4,5)\n> \n> - The tail (2,5) is removed since no food eaten, so new tail is at old B10 position (3,5)\n> \n> New positions: head (6,1), body1 (6,2), body2 (6,1)? No:\n> \n> - Head at (6,1)\n> \n> - Body1 at old head position (6,2)\n> \n> - Body2 at old B1 position (6,1) — but (6,1) is where head is now, so body2 is at (6,1), which is the same as head? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to the new cell. Then, each subsequent segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was. So the first body segment moves to where the head was, the second body segment moves to where the first was, and so on.\n> \n> For cells:\n> \n> - New head cell: (6,1)\n> \n> - Cell (6,2) is now occupied by the segment that was the head (now body)\n> \n> - Cell (6,1) was occupied by B1, but B1 moves to (6,2), so cell (6,1) is now head, and cell (6,2) has the old head segment.\n> \n> - Then B2 was at (5,1), it moves to where B1 was, which is (6,1), but (6,1) is now head, so it moves to the cell that had B1, which is now empty because B1 moved to (6,2).\n> \n> After head moves to (6,1), the cell (6,1) is occupied by head.\n> \n> The cell that had the head, (6,2), is now occupied by the segment that was B1, because B1 moves to the head's old position.\n> \n> Then, the segment that was B2 moves to the position that B1 was in, which is now empty, so B2 moves to (6,1)? No, B1 was at (6,1), so B2 moves to (6,1), but (6,1) is head, conflict.\n> \n> Positions:\n> \n> - Before move: head at P0, B1 at P1, B2 at P2, ..., tail at Pn\n> \n> - After move to new cell C:\n> \n> - New head at C\n> \n> - New body1 at P0\n> \n> - New body2 at P1\n> \n> - New body3 at P2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New tail at P_{n-1}  (since last segment is removed if no growth)\n> \n> So in this case, moving to (6,1):\n> \n> - New head at (6,1)\n> \n> - New body1 at (6,2)  (old head position)\n> \n> - New body2 at (6,1)  (old B1 position) — but (6,1) is the new head, so body2 at (6,1) and head at (6,1) same cell? Impossible.\n> \n> The old B1 position is (6,1), and new body2 is at that position, but new head is also at (6,1), so collision.\n> \n> But that can't be right because in snake games, you can move back on yourself if the tail moves away.\n> \n> For example, if the snake is moving right: head at (x,y), body at (x-1,y), tail at (x-2,y). If you move left to (x-1,y), new head at (x-1,y), which was body, but after move, the body moves to (x,y), so new head at (x-1,y), new body at (x,y), and tail at (x-1,y)? Let's simplify.\n> \n> Suppose snake of length 2: head at (1,1), tail at (1,2). Direction right, say.\n> \n> If move left to (1,0): new head at (1,0), new body at (1,1) (old head), and tail removed, so only head and body at (1,0) and (1,1), no problem.\n> \n> If move down to (2,1): new head at (2,1), new body at (1,1), tail removed.\n> \n> But if head at (1,1), body at (1,2), and you move up to (1,0) or something.\n> \n> In our case, head at (6,2), body1 at (6,1), so it's vertical.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,1), new head at (6,1), which was body1 position. But after move, new body1 is at (6,2) (old head position), and the segment that was body1 is now body2 at its new position, which is where? New body2 is at the old position of body1, which is (6,1), but new head is at (6,1), so both at same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> In terms of cells: new head occupies (6,1), and new body2 also wants to occupy (6,1), but new body2 is the segment that was body1, and it moves to the position that body1 was in, which is (6,1), but since head moved there, it's occupied, so yes, collision.\n> \n> But in standard snake, if you move directly back into the neck, it causes a collision because the neck doesn't move away fast enough.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But here, (6,1) is not the tail, it's the neck, the first body segment.\n> \n> So moving to a body segment other than the tail causes collision.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for (6,1), it is a body segment, not the tail, so moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5), far away.\n> \n> So from (6,2), moving down to (6,1) is invalid because it causes immediate collision with body segment at (6,1).\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (5,2) or right to (7,2), but right to (7,2): x=7 is border wall? Walls: x=0 or x=7, so x=7 is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> y=0 or y=7 walls.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,2):\n> \n> - Up: to (6,3)\n> \n> - Down: to (6,1) but (6,1) is body, collision, so invalid\n> \n> - Left: to (5,2)\n> \n> - Right: to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> So only possible moves: Up to (6,3) or Left to (5,2)\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so moving down would be reverse, but since down is invalid anyway, no issue with reverse rule.\n> \n> Reverse rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. But here, current direction is U, so opposite is D, which is invalid, so only Up or Left possible.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,4): value 1, life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> - (2,6): value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (4,5): value 1, life span 9, but currently under snake body.\n> \n> To eat (5,4), which is at (5,4), not occupied.\n> \n> But head is at (6,2), so how to get to (5,4) in one move? Not possible, since adjacent cells are (6,3), (5,2), (6,1), (7,2) but (7,2) wall, (6,1) invalid.\n> \n> So (5,4) is two moves away at least.\n> \n> From (6,2), I can go to (5,2) or (6,3).\n> \n> If I go to (5,2), then from there, I can go to (5,3), then to (5,4), but (5,4) life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn, so if not eaten on turn 62, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> So for (5,4), life span 1, so at turn 62, if not eaten, it disappears at the end of turn 62, I think.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So when food is present, it has a life span counter. At the turn it is spawned, counter = N. Each turn, counter decreases by 1. When counter reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> For (5,4), life span 1, so at turn 62, counter=1. After turn 62, counter becomes 0, and it disappears, so it can only be eaten on turn 62.\n> \n> But head is at (6,2), and (5,4) is not adjacent, so impossible to eat it this turn. Therefore, (5,4) will disappear after this turn and cannot be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 6, so can be eaten in next 6 turns.\n> \n> (4,5) life span 9, on body segment.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (6,2)\n> \n> Body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> Tail: (2,5) is last?

After a move, if the segment that was there moves to another cell, and no new segment moves to it, it becomes free.\n> \n> In the move, the only way (4,5) is vacated is if the segment that was there moves away and it is not the new position for another segment.\n> \n> In general, for a body cell, it is vacated when the segment there moves to the position of the previous segment, and since the tail is removed, if it was the tail position.\n> \n> But for an internal body segment, the cell is only vacated when that segment becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> For example, the cell (4,5) will be occupied as long as there is a segment assigned to it.

It's turn 63. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food: two items. First is at (2,6) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive). Second is at (4,5) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive). But (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake, since the snake positions include (4,5) as the 11th segment? Let me list the snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (5,2), 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5)\n> \n> So (4,5) is position 10, which is part of the body. And food is at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 8. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (2,6) with life span 6.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,2), direction L, so last move was left to (5,2). From (6,2) to (5,2), so yes, direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from L, opposite is R, so I can't move R. I can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,2)\n> \n> Possible next positions:\n> \n> - Left (L): (4,2)\n> \n> - Up (U): (5,3)\n> \n> - Down (D): (5,1)\n> \n> But I need to check if these are valid, meaning not walls and not colliding with body, except tail is ok if it moves.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,2) is within bounds, (5,3) within, (5,1) within? y=0 is wall, so (5,1) has y=1, which is not y=0, so should be ok? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not border wall? Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (5,1): x=5 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). None of these are (5,1) or (4,2) or (5,3), so all possible moves are not walls.\n> \n> Now, body collision: snake positions: (5,2) head, then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> If I move to (4,2): (4,2) is position 7 in the list, which is a body segment. But it's not the tail; tail is (3,5). Since the snake moves, if I move to (4,2), which is currently occupied, but after moving, the tail might move away, but in terms of collision, when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body part except the tail, it collides. But the tail is special because it moves.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is the current tail, it's ok because the tail moves, so the head and tail swap or something. But if it's not the tail, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is position 7, which is not the tail; tail is (3,5). So moving to (4,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is position 3 in the list, also a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> (5,3) is not in the snake positions? Let's see: positions are (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). (5,3) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> (4,3) is position 8, but (5,3) is not occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (4,2): but (4,2) is body segment (index 7), so collision! Not possible.\n> \n> - U to (5,3): not occupied, so ok.\n> \n> - D to (5,1): (5,1) is body segment (index 3), so collision, not possible.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Up to (5,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Head at (5,2), direction L. Moves: L to (4,2) - occupied by body (4,2), so invalid. U to (5,3) - empty, valid. D to (5,1) - occupied by (5,1), body, invalid. R to (6,2) - but R is opposite to L, so instant reverse not allowed, and also (6,2) is the first body segment, so definitely collision.\n> \n> So only U is possible? But that can't be right; let me double-check.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,2), then next is (6,2), which is to the right, so body segment. (5,1) is below, body. (4,2) is left, body. (5,3) is above, not occupied.\n> \n> Yes, so from (5,2), moving up to (5,3) is the only safe move.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7. Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). None at (5,3).\n> \n> Food: (2,6) and (4,5), but (4,5) is under snake body.\n> \n> For turn 63, I must choose an action.

No, when snake moves, the head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after move U: new positions: head at (5,3), then the previous head (5,2) becomes part of body, so the segment that was at (6,2) moves to (5,2), and so on.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (5,2), 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (5,3):\n> \n> - New head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Then body: position 0 becomes (5,2) (since head was there, now it's the neck)\n> \n> - Position 1 moves to where position 0 was, which is (5,2)\n> \n> - Position 2 moves to where position 1 was, (6,2)\n> \n> - Position 3 moves to where position 2 was, (6,1)\n> \n> - And so on, up to position 11 moves to where position 10 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - Then the tail, position 11, was at (3,5), but since it moves to (4,5), the cell (3,5) is vacated.\n> \n> The new positions after move U:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Body: (5,2)  // previous head\n> \n> - Then (6,2) moves to (5,2)?

Let's understand the movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and if no food eaten, tail moves away, so the cell is free.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the snake grows, and the food cell becomes part of snake.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move, head is at new position, if food eaten, the new tail is the old tail, else tail is removed.\n> \n> But for food under body: if food is under a body segment, when that segment moves away, the food is revealed, and can be eaten by moving head there later.\n> \n> Now, for (4,5), it's the tail, so when the snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves away from (4,5), freeing it, and food is there, so head can move to (4,5) to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,1), which is not tail, but a body segment. When the snake moves, segments shift, so (4,1) might move if the segment before moves, but it's not tail, so it only moves when the snake advances.\n> \n> To free a body cell, the snake needs to move so that the segment on that cell moves to another cell.\n> \n> For example, (4,1) is index 5, which is occupied. When the snake moves, if the head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So after one move, index 5 will be where index 4 was, etc., but the cell (4,1) might be occupied by a different segment or freed, depending on the move.\n> \n> It's messy; I should simulate possible moves.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: 6x6, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, but cells (0,y) etc. not playable, so focus on (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So mark obstacles:\n> \n> - (1,3): obstacle\n> \n> - (2,1): obstacle\n> \n> - (2,3): obstacle\n> \n> - (3,6): obstacle\n> \n> - (5,6): obstacle\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head (5,3)\n> \n> Body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, with head at (5,3) moving up.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,6): free, at top-left\n> \n> - (4,5): under tail, at (4,5)\n> \n> - (4,1): under body at (4,1), which is index 5, but (4,1) is occupied, and it's not tail.\n> \n> (4,1) is index 5 in positions, but it's a body segment.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (2,6) must be eaten within 5 turns (t64 to t68), (4,5) within 7 turns (t64-70), (4,1) within 10 turns (t64-73).\n> \n> I should prioritize eating (2,6) because it has shorter life span, but need to see if it's reachable safely.\n> \n> Also, (4,5) might be easy to eat since it's under tail; when tail moves, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> For (4,5), tail is at (4,5), food is there. If head moves to (4,5) when it's free, but at that moment, tail is moving away, so when head moves to (4,5), it eats the food, and since it was tail, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, meaning the cell (4,5) now has the head, and the new segment is added, so the tail is still at (4,5)? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify snake growth.\n> \n> When head moves to a food cell:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell (food cell)\n> \n> - Food is eaten, snake grows, so the body segments move, but tail does not move; the new length means that the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the snake increases in length by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions: [head, ..., tail]\n> \n> After moving to food: new head at food cell, the body segments shift, but since food eaten, tail is not removed, so the new positions are [new_head, old_head, ..., old_tail] with one more segment.\n> \n> So the cell where the tail was remains occupied by the tail, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> Example: positions before: [A, B, C] with C tail. Head at A.\n> \n> Move head to F (food), eat food, new positions: [F, A, B, C] so C is still tail, at its position.\n> \n> The cell where C was is still occupied by C, but now it's not tail anymore? No, in this case, C is still the tail.\n> \n> In the new list, positions [F, A, B, C], so head at F, tail at C.\n> \n> The cell that was C's position is still C, occupied.\n> \n> But in terms of the grid, the tail cell doesn't change immediately.\n> \n> For Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, but food is under tail, so when tail moves away, food is revealed, then head can move to it.\n> \n> But if head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food under it, when tail moves, food is revealed, and if head moves to that cell, it eats it. But after eating, since head is now where tail was, and tail was there, but tail moved, so the cell was freed, then head moves in.\n> \n> The danger is when head moves to the tail cell immediately after tail moves, but since tail moved, it's free, so no collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Ah, so when head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food (meaning food is under tail), if you eat that food, after eating, head is on that cell, and a new segment is added, but since the tail was there, and you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail position, but head is now there, so head and new tail are on the same cell?

That can't be.\n> \n> I think there's a misunderstanding.\n> \n> In standard snake, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not advance, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So positions: before: [H, S1, S2, ..., T] with T at position P.\n> \n> Head moves to F (which is T, in this case), eats food.\n> \n> New positions: [F, H, S1, S2, ..., T] but F is T, so [T, H, S1, S2, ..., T] — T is duplicated, which is impossible.\n> \n> Ah, that's the problem: if head moves to the tail cell to eat food, but tail was there, so after eating, the head is at T, and the tail is still at T, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> So, if head is adjacent to tail and moves to the tail cell which has food, it causes collision because after growth, head and tail are on same cell for that moment.\n> \n> Therefore, it's deadly.\n> \n> But if the tail moves away first, then the cell is free, and head can move to it without issue, as long as head wasn't adjacent when moving in.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,5), tail is at (4,5), food there.\n> \n> Head is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to (4,5).

That can't be.\n> \n> I think I confuse.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head to new, each segment to previous position, tail leaves.\n> \n> With eating, head to new, each segment to previous position, but tail does not leave, so the new tail is at the old tail position, and there is an extra segment there.\n> \n> So the position that was tail is now occupied by the new last segment, and the new second last is at the previous position of the old second last.\n> \n> In this case, before move, positions: 0: (5,5) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,2), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (3,2), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - New position 1: old head (5,5)\n> \n> - New position 2: old pos1 (5,4)\n> \n> - New position 3: old pos2 (5,3)\n> \n> - New position 4: old pos3 (5,2)\n> \n> - New position 5: old pos4 (6,2)\n> \n> - New position 6: old pos5 (6,1)\n> \n> - New position 7: old pos6 (5,1)\n> \n> - New position 8: old pos7 (4,1)\n> \n> - New position 9: old pos8 (3,1)\n> \n> - New position 10: old pos9 (3,2)\n> \n> - New position 11: old pos10 (4,2)\n> \n> - New position 12: old pos11 (4,3)  // this was tail, now it is the new position 12\n> \n> - And since ate, a new position 13 is added at old tail position (4,3), so both position 12 and 13 at (4,3)? No, that's wrong.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Correct: when the snake eats, after moving the head to the food cell, the body moves as usual, but the tail does not move, so the segment that was at the tail position stays there, and a new segment is added there, so the tail position is occupied, and the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the new position list is: new head position, then the old head position, then the old position 1, and so on, up to the old tail position, and then the old tail position again for the new segment.\n> \n> So for example, new positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,3) for the new tail segment. So (4,3) has two segments? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think: the body segments move to the next position only if not the tail when eating. When no eat, all segments move, tail leaves. When eat, head moves, body segments move to their next, but the tail does not move, so the last position is occupied by the tail, and a new segment is added at that position, so the snake has the same positions plus the new head, but the tail remains.\n> \n> Positions before move: list of cells, e.g. [A, B, C, D] with A head, D tail.\n> \n> Move head to E with food: new positions [E, A, B, C, D] because tail D stays, so new head E, then old head A, then B, C, D, so D is now the tail again, but with an extra segment.\n> \n> From [A,B,C,D] to [E,A,B,C,D] with E new head, D new tail.\n> \n> Length increased.\n> \n> In this case, before turn 66 move, positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] with head (5,5), tail (4,3).\n> \n> Move head to (4,5) with eat: new positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] with head (4,5), tail (4,3).\n> \n> So (4,3) is tail, and it is occupied.\n> \n> Now at (4,5), for turn 67, possible moves:\n> \n> From (4,5), last direction L (since moved left to here).\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,5), R to (5,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4).\n> \n> (3,5): x=3,y=5, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (3,6) but y=5, so free), not in snake positions above, so empty.\n> \n> (5,5): is in positions, seg1 at (5,5), so occupied, collision if move there.\n> \n> (4,6): as before, dead end, only connected to (4,5), and surrounded by walls or obstacles.\n> \n> (4,4): is in positions, seg2 at (5,4)? Positions: head (4,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), etc., so (4,4) not in list? Seg2 is (5,4), not (4,4). (4,4) is not occupied; in new positions, we have (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), etc., no (4,4), so (4,4) is free.\n> \n> At turn 66 after move, positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2),

prioritizes eating the accessible positive food at (4,5) by turn 66 for immediate score gain, then moves left and downward to avoid the high-risk area near obstacles and the short-lived food at (2,6), which is unreachable within its lifespan. Long-term survival is emphasized by steering toward open spaces to minimize collision risks.\n",

It's turn 66. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) since borders are walls, but with obstacles blocking some cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3). So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it just moved up to (5,5) from (5,4), I assume.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 8, value +1? Wait, it says \"value1\" but in the list, for (2,6,3,1), I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). Value is 1 for all, since it says value1, etc. But (4,1,8,1) – let's confirm the format.\n> \n> It says: Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) etc. So for (2,6,3,1), it might be (x,y, life_span, value), but it's written as ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so I think it's (x,y), value, life_span.\n> \n> Looking: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for first food: position (2,6), value 1, life_span 3.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5), value 1, life_span 5\n> \n> (4,1), value 1, life_span 8\n> \n> All are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, life span: decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 66, life_span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is how many turns it remains, including the current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for food at (2,6) with life_span 3 on turn 66, it will disappear after turn 68? Let's think:\n> \n> - On turn 66: life_span 3, so after this turn, it decreases to 2.\n> \n> - Turn 67: life_span 2, decreases to 1.\n> \n> - Turn 68: life_span 1, decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 66, 67, 68, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life_span 5: can be eaten from turn 66 to 70.\n> \n> (4,1) life_span 8: turns 66 to 73.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,5), direction Up. Current possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be instant reverse (opposite to current direction). Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> So from Up, I can go U, L, R, but not D.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls at borders, so playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Playable cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except:\n> \n> - (3,6) obstacle\n> \n> - (2,1) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,3) obstacle\n> \n> - (2,3) obstacle\n> \n> - (5,6) obstacle\n> \n> Also, snake body occupies: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n> \n> Food at: (2,6), (4,5), (4,1)\n> \n> But (4,1) has food, but snake body is at (4,1)?

Walls: x=7 is border, so x=6 is not border, and no obstacle listed at (6,5). Snake body: positions include (6,2), (6,1), but not (6,5). (6,5) seems free? But let's list all snake positions: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3). So (6,5) not occupied.\n> \n> Also, no obstacle at (6,5). So (6,5) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): x=4,y=5. Not border, no obstacle listed, snake not occupying except head is at (5,5), so (4,5) should be free.

But direction is given as L, which is current head direction.

Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So for (2,6), life span 2 at turn 67: after turn 67, countdown becomes 1, then after turn 68, it disappears.

And it's the next segment, so if I move right, head goes to (5,5), which is occupied by the body, but in snake games, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is body, it collides unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Rules: deadly collisions include body collision, except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

No: when the head moves, the entire snake shifts.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.

No, the no instant reverse is about input: I cannot choose to move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot choose R on this turn.

I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed if no food eaten.

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's safe, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,5): (4,5) is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, the head moves to (4,5), and the body shifts, so the segment that was at (4,5) moves to (4,4), and so on. But when head moves to (4,5), at that moment, (4,5) is occupied by the body, but since it's the segment that will move away, it might be okay? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At the start of turn, before move, positions are fixed. When you choose to move head to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell is not occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, it's safe. If it is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides. If it is the tail, and the tail moves away, it's safe.\n> \n> In this list, the tail is at (4,2). Positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (3,2), 12: (4,2) – that's the tail.\n> \n> So, from (4,4), moving:\n> \n> - U to (4,5): (4,5) is segment 1, which is not the tail. If head moves there, it would be colliding with body segment before movement. But after movement, the segments shift, so when head moves to (4,5), segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,4), so (4,5) is now head, and the old segment there is gone? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if that cell was occupied by a body segment, it might cause collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell that is occupied, if it is the tail cell, and tail moves away, no collision; otherwise, collision.\n> \n> Here, (4,5) is occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail (tail is at (4,2)), so moving to (4,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D to (4,3): (4,3) is not in the positions, so it might be free or wall? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Current occupied cells by snake: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y), (7,y) for y=0 to 7, (x,0), (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But since grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, I assume.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U: (4,5) - occupied by snake body, not tail, so deadly.\n> \n> - D: (4,3) - let's check if wall or obstacle or snake. (4,3): not in snake positions, not border wall (since x=4, y=3, between 0 and 7), not internal obstacle (obstacles are (3,6),(2,1),(1,3),(2,3),(5,6)), so (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> - L: (3,4) - similarly, (3,4) not in snake, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles: (3,6) is different, (2,1) etc., (3,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - R: (5,4) - (5,4) is occupied by snake segment 3? Positions: index 3 is (5,4), which is body, not tail. So moving to (5,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,4), possible safe moves are only D to (4,3) or L to (3,4). Cannot go U or R because of body, and cannot go reverse to U since last direction was D, but U is reverse anyway and also occupied.\n> \n> Last direction is D, so reverse would be U, which is not allowed and also deadly. R is to (5,4) which is body, deadly. So only D or L.\n> \n> D to (4,3) or L to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 6, life_span 1? Wait, food: (2,6,1,1) – probably (x,y,value,life_span)\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1,6,1) and (1,5,9,1)\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (2,6): value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (4,1): value 6, life_span 1\n> \n> - (1,5): value 9, life_span 1\n> \n> Life_span 1 for all? That means they disappear after this turn or next? \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food with life_span N, it appears and lasts for N turns, including the current turn. So if life_span=1, it disappears after this turn, meaning it can be eaten only on this turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, if food has life_span L, it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0, and after countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Typically, when spawned, countdown starts at N, decreases each turn, and when it becomes 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something. But here it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's interpret: suppose at turn t, food has life_span N. Then on turn t, countdown = N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. It can be eaten as long as countdown >0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves to food cell on a turn, it is eaten at that time.\n> \n> For food with life_span N:\n> \n> - On turn when it appears, countdown = N\n> \n> - After each turn, countdown decreases by 1\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, after the turn, it disappears.\n> \n> - So it can be eaten on turns where countdown >=1.\n> \n> Here, all foods have life_span 1 at turn 68. So for (2,6,1,1): at turn 68, life_span=1, so after this turn, it will disappear. It can be eaten only on turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1,6,1): life_span=1, disappears after turn 68, can be eaten only on turn 68.\n> \n> (1,5,9,1): same, life_span=1, can be eaten only on turn 68.\n> \n> But turn 68 is the current turn, and I need to choose the action for turn 68.\n> \n> In the action sequence, I need to output for turn t1=68, then t1+1, etc.\n> \n> But for turn 68, I need to move the snake now.\n> \n> Current head at (4,4), and I can move to (4,3) or (3,4).\n> \n> Now, if I move to (4,3), that's down, which is same direction, or to (3,4) left.\n> \n> But there is food at (4,1), which is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (4,1), which is segment 9 or something.\n> \n> Positions: (4,1) is in the list, index 9: (4,1)\n> \n> And food is at (4,1) with value 6, life_span 1.\n> \n> But (4,1) is occupied by the snake body. Specifically, it's segment 9, which is not the tail; tail is (4,2)? Positions: index 12 is (4,2), tail.\n> \n> Index 9 is (4,1), which is part of the body.\n> \n> Now, rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> For food at (4,1), it is under the snake body, segment at (4,1).\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (4,4), far from (4,1).\n> \n> But life_span is 1, so it can only be eaten on this turn, turn 68.\n> \n> If I don't eat it now, it disappears.\n> \n> But to eat it, I need to have the head move to (4,1) this turn, but that's impossible because (4,1) is 3 cells away, and I can only move one step per turn.\n> \n> So, it's impossible to eat (4,1) on this turn because head is at (4,4), and (4,1) is three moves away. Even if I move directly, it would take 3 turns, but life_span is 1, so after this turn, it disappears. So I cannot eat (4,1) at all; it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,6) and (1,5), but they might be reachable?\n> \n> First, (4,1): since it's occupied and I can't reach it in one move, and it disappears after this turn, I cannot eat it.

So:\n> \n> - Turn 69: life span 6, can be eaten\n> \n> - After eating or not, at end of turn, life span decreases to 5\n> \n> - Turn 70: life span 5, can be eaten\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 74: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 74, it disappears, so not available on turn 75.\n> \n> Similarly, for other food.\n> \n> Second food: (1,5) with value 1 and life span 8. So available from turn 69 to 76 (since 8 turns: 69 to 76 inclusive? Life span 8 at turn 69, so decreases each turn, so available until turn 69 + 7 = 76? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 69: life span 8\n> \n> - Turn 70: life span 7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 76: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 77: disappears\n> \n> So can be eaten from turn 69 to 76.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,4), moving left (L). So possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R because of no instant reverse.

It's turn 70, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't explicitly given, but from the wall borders, it seems like x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so an 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is bounded by these walls; moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision.\n> - Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). These are fixed obstacles; snake can't go there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,3), and the body segments follow: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> - Segment 1: (3,4)\n> - Segment 2: (4,4)\n> - Segment 3: (4,5)\n> - Segment 4: (5,5)\n> - Segment 5: (5,4)\n> - Segment 6: (5,3)\n> - Segment 7: (5,2)\n> - Segment 8: (6,2)\n> - Segment 9: (6,1)\n> - Segment 10: (5,1)\n> - Segment 11: (4,1)\n> - Segment 12: (3,1)\n> \n> That's 13 segments? Let me count: positions given: 13 positions. Snake length is 13.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down. So current movement is downward, meaning increasing y? No, in grid coordinates, usually y increases up, but in the movement definition:\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — so y+1 is up? That might be confusing.\n> \n> Movement definitions:\n> - U: (x, y+1) — so if y increases, it's upward.\n> - D: (x, y-1) — y decreases, downward.\n> - L: (x-1, y)\n> - R: (x+1, y)\n> \n> And head direction is D, so moving down, decreasing y.\n> \n> Current head at (3,3), direction D, so moving to (3,2) or something? But let's see the positions: from head (3,3) to next segment (3,4). (3,4) has higher y, so if head was at (3,4) and moved down to (3,3), that makes sense.\n> \n> Previous head position: since the body is given head first, and direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,3). Before that, head was at (3,4), moved down to (3,3). Yes.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> - (4,1,5,1) — I think this means (x,y, life_span, value). Format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but here it's given as (4,1,5,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's check.\n> \n> It says: Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (4,1,5,1), (1,5,7,1), (1,1,10,1)\n> \n> Probably it's (x, y, life_span, value) since value should be +1 or -1, and all are 1, so positive food? But it says \"Value and Life Span\", so for (4,1,5,1) it might be x=4,y=1, life_span=5, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5,7,1) : x=1,y=5, life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (1,1,10,1) : x=1,y=1, life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> All have value=1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 70, so for food at (4,1): life_span=5, so it will disappear after turn 70 + 5 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> If life_span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if food has life_span L, then:\n> \n> - On turn t, it is present, countdown L\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown L-1, and so on, until countdown reaches 0, and after that it disappears. \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" means it will be present for N turns including the current one, or not?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at turn t, countdown is L, then at turn t+1, it's L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, countdown=1, then at turn t + L, it disappears? Or after N turns from now.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: when food is spawned, it has life_span N. On each turn, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, the food disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? But for movement, we care if it's present when we move.\n> \n> But for simplicity, since we move on a turn, and food is eaten if head moves onto it on that turn.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" — I think it means that after N turns from the current, it will be gone. So with countdown decreasing each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear at the start of turn t + L. So it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1.\n> \n> Countdown: at turn t, countdown is L; turn t+1, L-1; ... turn t+L-1, countdown=1; then on turn t+L, it's gone.\n> \n> In the input, life_span is given, and current turn is t=70.\n> \n> For food at (4,1): life_span=5, so countdown at turn 70 is 5, so it will disappear after turn 74? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 70: countdown=5\n> \n> - Turn 71: countdown=4\n> \n> - Turn 72: countdown=3\n> \n> - Turn 73: countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn 74: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 75: countdown=0, disappears? But \"disappears after N turns\" — N=5, so after 5 turns from now, meaning at the start of turn 75 it disappears. So it is present on turns 70 to 74 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But we don't need to worry about exact turns yet.\n> \n> Food at (4,1): x=4,y=1, life_span=5, value=1\n> \n> But look at snake positions: (4,1) is part of the snake! Specifically, it's the 11th segment: positions are [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] so (4,1) is the 12th segment? Index: head is index 0: (3,3), then 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,5), 4:(5,5), 5:(5,4), 6:(5,3), 7:(5,2), 8:(6,2), 9:(6,1), 10:(5,1), 11:(4,1), 12:(3,1). So (4,1) is position 11, which is the body.\n> \n> But food is at (4,1), which is under the snake's body. According to rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (3,3), direction D, so moving down.\n> \n> Other food: (1,5,7,1) — x=1,y=5, life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (1,1,10,1) — x=1,y=1, life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> And borders: x=0,7; y=0,7 are walls.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8x8 cells, with walls on boundaries.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action for turn 70 and a sequence for at least 5 turns ahead.

Since current direction is D, reverse is U, so I cannot move U on next turn. So possible moves: D, L, R. (since U is opposite of D)\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from D, I can go D (continue down), L (left), R (right), but not U.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid around head.\n> \n> Head at (3,3)\n> \n> Neighbors:\n> \n> - Up: (3,4) — but y+1 is up? U: (x,y+1), so from (3,3), U to (3,4)\n> \n> But (3,4) is occupied by snake body, segment 1.

Let's see if it's wall or obstacle or snake.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, y=2 is not wall, but internal obstacles? Obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) — none at (3,2). Snake positions: snake is at (3,3), (3,4), etc., not at (3,2). So (3,2) should be free, but let's list all snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So (3,2) is not occupied by snake. No obstacle, not wall (y=2 >0), so (3,2) is free.\n> \n> Left: L: (x-1,y) to (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3): is it free? Walls: x=0 and x=7 walls, x=2 not wall.

When snake moves, that segment will move to where the previous segment was, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake body.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (3,3)\n> \n> 1: (3,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (4,5)\n> \n> 4: (5,5)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (5,3)\n> \n> 7: (5,2)\n> \n> 8: (6,2)\n> \n> 9: (6,1)\n> \n> 10: (5,1)\n> \n> 11: (4,1)\n> \n> 12: tail (3,1)\n> \n> When snake moves, say to a new head position, then each segment from 1 to 12 moves to the position of the previous index.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (3,2), then:\n> \n> New head: (3,2)\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to old head (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to old segment1 (3,4)\n> \n> Segment 3 to old seg2 (4,4)\n> \n> ...\n> Up to segment 12 moves to old segment11 (4,1)\n> \n> And old tail (3,1) is abandoned.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to (4,3), then:\n> \n> New head: (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 1 to (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 2 to (3,4)\n> \n> Segment 3 to (4,4)\n> \n> And so on.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) is currently occupied by segment 11. After one move, if no eat, segment 11 will move to where segment 10 was, which is (5,1), and (4,1) will be occupied by segment 12 moving to it? Let's see:\n> \n> After move, new positions:\n> \n> If head moves to (3,2):\n> \n> - New pos0: (3,2)  // new head\n> \n> - New pos1: old pos0 = (3,3)\n> \n> - New pos2: old pos1 = (3,4)\n> \n> - New pos3: old pos2 = (4,4)\n> \n> - New pos4: old pos3 = (4,5)\n> \n> - New pos5: old pos4 = (5,5)\n> \n> - New pos6: old pos5 = (5,4)\n> \n> - New pos7: old pos6 = (5,3)\n> \n> - New pos8: old pos7 = (5,2)\n> \n> - New pos9: old pos8 = (6,2)\n> \n> - New pos10: old pos9 = (6,1)\n> \n> - New pos11: old pos10 = (5,1)\n> \n> - New pos12: old pos11 = (4,1)  // new tail\n> \n> Old pos12 (3,1) abandoned.\n> \n> So (4,1) is now occupied by new tail, segment 12.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is still under the snake, now the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to (4,3):\n> \n> New head: (4,3)\n> \n> New pos1: (3,3)\n> \n> New pos2: (3,4)\n> \n> New pos3: (4,4)\n> \n> New pos4: (4,5)\n> \n> New pos5: (5,5)\n> \n> New pos6: (5,4)\n> \n> New pos7: (5,3)\n> \n> New pos8: (5,2)\n> \n> New pos9: (6,2)\n> \n> New pos10: (6,1)\n> \n> New pos11: (5,1)  // old pos10\n> \n> New pos12: (4,1)  // old pos11\n> \n> Again, (4,1) is occupied by new tail.\n> \n> So in both cases, after one move, (4,1) is still occupied by the tail.\n> \n> To free (4,1), we need the tail to move away from it. Since tail is at (3,1) now, and after move, new tail is at (4,1), so (4,1) is occupied.\n> \n> The food at (4,1) has life_span 5, so it will disappear after turn 74, present until turn 74.\n> \n> To eat it, we need to have (4,1) free and head move to it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,1) is body, and after moves, it might stay occupied.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,1), and the segment before tail is at (4,1), so when the snake moves, the tail moves to (4,1) if head moves in a way that the body shifts.\n> \n> But to free (4,1), we need the snake to move such that the segment at (4,1) moves away and no one moves to it, but since it's not the tail, when it moves, the cell is freed only if it was the tail position, but here it's not tail.\n> \n> Let's think differently.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) is currently occupied by segment 11. When the snake moves, segment 11 will move to a new position, so (4,1) is freed only if no other segment moves to it immediately, but in the new position, segment 11 moves to where segment 10 was, so (5,1), and the cell (4,1) is left empty, but then segment 12 moves to (4,1)? No.\n> \n> In the movement:\n> \n> Before move: positions: ..., seg10: (5,1), seg11: (4,1), seg12: (3,1)\n> \n> After head moves to new position, say (3,2):\n> \n> Then new seg1: (3,3)  // old head\n> \n> new seg2: (3,4)  // old seg1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> new seg11: (5,1)  // old seg10\n> \n> new seg12: (4,1)  // old seg11\n> \n> So the cell (4,1) is now occupied by new seg12 (tail).\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves elsewhere.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) is never freed because the tail moves to it.\n> \n> To free (4,1), we need the tail to be at a different position, but currently tail is at (3,1), and it will move to (4,1) on the next move.\n> \n> Unless we eat food, but if we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But we can't eat food at (4,1) now because it's under body.\n> \n> Perhaps we can move in a way that the tail doesn't move to (4,1).\n> \n> Current tail at (3,1). The previous segment is seg11 at (4,1).\n> \n> When we move, if we don't eat, the new tail will be at old seg11 position, which is (4,1).\n> \n> If we do eat food somewhere, then tail doesn't move, so new segment added at head, and tail stays, so old tail position is still occupied, but the cell where we ate is new head.\n> \n> But for (4,1), it's under body, not accessible.\n> \n> The only way to free (4,1) is to have the snake move such that the segment at (4,1) moves and no one replaces it, but since it's not the tail, when it moves, the cell is freed, but in the new configuration, the cell that was seg11 position is now occupied by seg12 moving to it.\n> \n> In standard snake movement, when the snake moves forward, the tail cell is abandoned, and all body cells are occupied continuously.\n> \n> For a body cell not the tail, when the snake moves, that cell is vacated and the segment moves to the next position, so the cell is free for a moment, but in terms of grid state at the beginning of turn, it's occupied until the move.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can be eaten only if at some point the cell is free and head moves to it.\n> \n> In this case, since (4,1) is not the tail, after the snake moves, (4,1) is occupied by the new tail, so it's still occupied, so the food is not accessible.\n> \n> Unless the tail is at (3,1), and we move in a way that the new tail is not at (4,1), but that only happens if we eat food.\n> \n> Suppose on this turn, we move and eat food at some other location, then the tail doesn't move, so the cell (4,1) is still occupied by seg11, but now it's not the tail, and in the new position, seg11 is still at (4,1) if we don't move in that direction, but let's see.\n> \n> If we eat food, the snake grows, so when head moves to new position, a new segment is added at the head position, and the body segments move, but the tail stays where it is.\n> \n> For example, if we move to a cell with food, say we move to (3,2) and there is food there, but (3,2) has no food, only food at (4,1), (1,5), (1,1).\n> \n> (3,2) is free, no food.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is free, no food.\n> \n> So if we move to (3,2) or (4,3), we don't eat food, so no growth, tail moves to (4,1).\n> \n> If we could move to a cell with food, but no food at possible moves.\n> \n> So for now, after one move, (4,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> Then on subsequent moves, the tail will move, but (4,1) might be occupied by different segments.\n> \n> But since the food is at (4,1), and it's under the snake, to eat it, we need the head to be able to move to (4,1) when it's free.\n> \n> But with the current snake position, (4,1) is always occupied because the snake is long and covering it.\n> \n> Let's list the positions: the snake is from (3,3) to (3,1) with a path.\n> \n> From head (3,3) down to (3,2)?

But tail moving away means that after the snake moves, the tail will be at a different position.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,1).

Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 71, life span 4, after turn 71, it becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then on turn 74, after move, if not eaten, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 71, 72, 73, or 74.\n> \n> But to eat it, head must be on (4,1) when it moves there.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,3). Moving to (4,1) directly isn't possible because (4,1) is two steps down, but we move one step at a time.\n> \n> Path to (4,1): from (4,3), to go to (4,1), I need to move down twice, but there might be obstacles or body in the way.\n> \n> Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Head at (4,3). Body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So the cell below head, (4,2), is free?

From snake positions, not listed, obstacles not listed, so (4,2) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) has food and tail.\n> \n> To eat food at (4,1), I need to move head to (4,1) after the tail moves away.\n> \n> When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves, so (4,1) becomes free with food, and head can go there later.\n> \n> But if on a move, head goes to a food, it eats and grows, so tail doesn't move, the food is consumed and snake grows, so tail stays, but new segment added.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, snake grows by one, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Otherwise, no food, head moves, tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (4,1), which is current tail position.\n> \n> If head moves directly to (4,1) now, is that possible?\n> \n> From (4,3), moving down to (4,2), but (4,1) is tail, so if I move down to (4,2), that's fine, but (4,2) is free, I think.\n> \n> Then from (4,2), I can move down to (4,1), but when I move to (4,1), if the food is still there, I eat it.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Currently, head at (4,3), tail at (4,1). Are they adjacent? (4,3) and (4,1) are two cells apart, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,3) and (4,2) would be adjacent, or (4,3) and (3,3), etc.\n> \n> (4,3) and (4,1) are not adjacent; they are separated by (4,2).\n> \n> So currently, head is not adjacent to tail.

No.\n> \n> When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, the food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail doesn't move.

No.\n> \n> The snake body: before move, positions: head (4,2), then previous body, and tail (4,1).\n> \n> After moving down to (4,1), which has food, so head moves to (4,1), consumes food, and a new segment is added to the tail. Since tail was at (4,1), and head moves to (4,1), but (4,1) was tail, now head is there, so the new segment is added, meaning the tail position becomes the previous tail, but since head is on the food cell, the new tail segment is added after the current tail, but in terms of positions.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - If no food eaten: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> - If food eaten: head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to a cell with food, the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added, so the cell that was tail remains occupied by the new segment.\n> \n> But here, the food is at the tail cell (4,1).\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,1), which is the current tail position, and eats the food, then: head moves to (4,1), consumes food, the body segments shift, but the tail (4,1) was occupied, now head is there, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but the tail was at (4,1), which is now the head, so the new segment is added after the current last segment.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [ (4,2), ..., (4,1) ] with (4,1) tail.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (4,1), but (4,1) was tail, so when head moves to (4,1), it's moving to the tail cell. Since it eats food, the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the end, so the snake becomes: new head at (4,1), then the previous head (4,2) becomes the next segment, and so on, and the tail (4,1) is replaced by the new head, but a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is now head? Confusing.\n> \n> Let's think with smaller snake.\n> \n> Suppose snake positions: [A, B] with A head, B tail. If head moves to a food cell, say to C, which has food, then new positions: [C, A] and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so it becomes [C, A, B], with B as new tail.\n> \n> But in this case, C is a new cell.\n> \n> In our case, if head moves to the current tail cell.\n> \n> Current positions: head at (4,2), tail at (4,1). Head moves down to (4,1), which is the tail cell and has food.\n> \n> So head moves to (4,1), which was tail, so the new head position is (4,1). Since food eaten, the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position. But the previous tail position is (4,1), which is now the head, so adding a new segment at (4,1) would cause collision? No.\n> \n> The new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, which is (4,1). But after the move, the head is at (4,1), so if we add a new segment at (4,1), it would be on the same cell as head, which is impossible.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard implementation: when head moves to a food cell, the head occupies that cell, the body segments move forward, so the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1, but since tail doesn't move, the last position remains, and a new segment is added at the last position, so the tail extends.\n> \n> But when head moves to the tail cell, it's a problem.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, if head is adjacent to tail, and head moves to tail cell to eat the food, then after eating, head is on that cell, and a new tail segment is added at the old tail position, but since head moved to it, the old tail position is now head, so the new segment is added at the same position, causing collision.\n> \n> But in our situation, when head is at (4,2) and tail at (4,1), they are adjacent. If head moves down to (4,1) to eat the food, then it should cause death because after eating, the new segment is added at (4,1), but head is already there, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the danger.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (4,1) when head is adjacent to it; I need to eat it when head is not adjacent, so that after moving to it, the tail has moved away.\n> \n> For example, if head is not adjacent, and I move to the food cell after the tail has moved away.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,1), since it's the tail, when the snake moves without eating, the tail will move away, freeing the cell, and the food is there.

Also internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake: positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Then: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)  // tail\n> \n> Since head is at (4,2) and direction is D (down), last move was down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is head, and previous position is (4,3), which is above, so if head was at (4,3) and moved down to (4,2), that makes sense, direction D.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life_span 3\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life_span 5\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life_span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? Value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"value1\" etc., but in the food list, it's (x,y, life_span, value), I think. Let me check.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 1, 3, 1) - (1, 5, 5, 1) - (1, 1, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> So for (4,1): x=4, y=1, life_span=3, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5): x=1,y=5, life_span=5, value=1\n> \n> (1,1): x=1,y=1, life_span=8, value=1\n> \n> All value=1, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Life_span: for (4,1), life_span=3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including current turn. So on turn 72, it has 3 turns left; after turn 72, it has 2 left, and so on, until turn 75 it disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) has 5 turns, disappears on turn 77.\n> \n> (1,1) has 8 turns, disappears on turn 80.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,2), direction D (down). Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move down, left, or right, but not up (because no instant reverse).\n> \n> Current direction is D, so I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - Down: to (4,1)\n> \n> - Left: to (3,2)\n> \n> - Right: to (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> (4,1): is this occupied? Snake positions: tail is at (5,1), but (4,1) is not listed in snake positions. Snake: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So (4,1) is not occupied by snake body. Also, is it a wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, but y=1 is not a border wall. x=4, y=1 is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) — (2,1) is an obstacle, but (4,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> (4,1) has food with value 1.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,1). Head is at (4,2), which is adjacent to tail? (4,2) and (5,1) are diagonally adjacent? Adjacency: up, down, left, right, not diagonally. So (4,2) and (5,1) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so same x or y differing by 1.\n> \n> From (4,2), adjacent cells: (4,1) down, (4,3) up, (3,2) left, (5,2) right.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to head; it's diagonal. (5,1) is below and right of (4,2), but not sharing an edge.\n> \n> The tail segment itself: (5,1) is the tail, but head is not adjacent to it. Adjacent to tail would be if head is next to the tail cell.\n> \n> But (5,1) has no food; food is at (4,1), (1,5), (1,1). (4,1) has food, but (5,1) is tail and has no food listed.\n> \n> Food positions are separate; (5,1) is snake tail, not food.\n> \n> So for moving to (4,1): it has food, and if I eat it, snake grows, so new tail will be added, but since it's eaten, the tail doesn't move immediately? Standard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the snake extends.\n> \n> But in terms of collision: when you move to a food cell, you eat it, so the head moves to that cell, and since you grow, the tail doesn't move, so the new length is old length +1, and tail remains.\n> \n> But collision is checked after the move.\n> \n> Now, specifically for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, head is at (4,2), tail at (5,1), not adjacent. And (5,1) has no food; food is at (4,1).\n> \n> If I move down to (4,1), I eat the food there.\n> \n> Then, after moving, head is at (4,1), and since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake body includes the old tail (5,1) still.\n> \n> Now, positions: head moves to (4,1), body: the segment that was at (4,2) becomes new body, and so on, but since growth, the tail (5,1) stays, so snake positions become: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)] — (5,1) is still there because tail didn't move.\n> \n> Then, is there collision? Head at (4,1), and body segments: (4,2) is adjacent, but (4,2) is the neck, so when you move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the segment that was behind head moves to head's old position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, new head position, and a new body segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and the segment before tail becomes part of body.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move: head at P0, body at P1, P2, ..., P_k tail.\n> \n> After moving to food: head moves to new cell F, which has food, so new head at F. Then, the body: P0 becomes new segment at position P0, P1 moves to P0, P2 to P1, ..., P_k (tail) stays at P_k, and since growth, a new segment is added at P_k? No.\n> \n> Typically, when snake eats, the tail doesn't move, so the length increases. So positions: new head at F, then the old head P0 becomes next segment, P1 becomes next, ..., up to old tail P_k remains, so the snake has segments: F, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_k.\n> \n> So in this case, before move: positions [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]  // head (4,2), tail (5,1)\n> \n> If move down to (4,1) and eat food: new head at (4,1), then old head (4,2) becomes next, then (4,3), (3,3), ..., down to tail (5,1) which stays. So new positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n> \n> Now, is head at (4,1) colliding with any body? (4,2) is adjacent and occupied, but (4,2) is the segment right behind head, which is fine; collision is only with other body parts, not the immediate neck.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" but typically, the head can be adjacent to the neck without issue; it's only a problem if it hits a segment that is not the immediate successor.\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) and (4,2) are adjacent, but (4,2) is the new neck, so no collision. Other segments: (4,3) is at (4,3), not adjacent to (4,1). (3,3) etc. are farther. Tail at (5,1) is diagonal to (4,1)? (4,1) and (5,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> (4,1) and (5,1) share the same y, x differs by 1, so yes, adjacent.\n> \n> In the new positions, head at (4,1), and (5,1) is a body segment (the tail), so head is at (4,1), body includes (5,1), which is adjacent to head.\n> \n> (4,1) and (5,1) are adjacent cells.\n> \n> And (5,1) has no food; it's a body segment.\n> \n> But the tail reward danger rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> Here, after moving, head is adjacent to the tail at (5,1), but (5,1) does not have food; it's a body segment. The food was at (4,1), which was eaten.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, (5,1) is the tail, but it doesn't have food.\n> \n> So moving to (4,1) should be safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the positions: after move, head at (4,1), tail at (5,1), which are adjacent, but since no food on tail, it should be ok.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\", but here tail cell has no food, so not applicable.\n> \n> So eating (4,1) should be fine.\n> \n> Now, life_span of (4,1) is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including turn 72. So if I don't eat it now, it might disappear.\n> \n> Turn 72: if I move to it, I eat it.\n> \n> If I don't, after turn 72, life_span decreases to 2, and so on.\n> \n> But since it's close, and I can eat it now.\n> \n> Now, other options: move left to (3,2) or right to (5,2).\n> \n> First, (3,2): is it free? Snake positions: (4,2) is head, (4,3) is above, (3,3) is left and up, etc. (3,2) not in positions. Obstacles: internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) — (3,2) not listed, so should be free. No food there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2): is it occupied? Snake has (5,2) as a body segment? Positions: (5,2) is in the list: after (5,3), before (6,2), so (5,2) is occupied by body. Specifically, index: head (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), then (5,2), then (6,2), etc. So (5,2) is a body segment, so I cannot move to (5,2) because it would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is free, (3,2) is free.\n> \n> (4,1) has food, (3,2) has no food.\n> \n> Moving to (5,2) is invalid because occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves: down to (4,1) or left to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to (4,1) now.\n> \n> Turn 72: move D to (4,1), eat food, value +1, snake grows.\n> \n> After move: head at (4,1), positions: as above, length increases by 1, tail at (5,1) remains.\n> \n> Life_span of that food was 3, but since eaten, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, direction: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, from (4,1), possible moves: down to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Left to (3,1), right to (5,1), or up to (4,2).\n> \n> But (4,2) is now a body segment, occupied.\n> \n> (5,1) is tail, but occupied.\n> \n> (3,1): is it free? Check obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) not listed. Snake: (3,1) not in positions, so should be free.\n> \n> (4,0) is wall.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible moves: left to (3,1) or up to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by body, so cannot move there. Only left to (3,1) or right to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied, so only possible move is left to (3,1)?\n> \n> (4,1) to (3,1): that's left.\n> \n> (4,1) to (5,1): right, but (5,1) occupied.\n> \n> (4,1) to (4,0): down, wall.\n> \n> (4,1) to (4,2): up, but (4,2) occupied.\n> \n> So only possible move is left to (3,1).\n> \n> Is (3,1) free? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) is not listed, so no obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions after eating (4,1): head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n> \n> So (3,1) not occupied, so I can move to (3,1).\n> \n> Then turn 73: move L to (3,1).\n> \n> No food there, so no growth, tail moves.\n> \n> After move: head to (3,1), then body: (4,1) becomes new segment, then (4,2), (4,3), etc., and tail (5,1) moves away?

Since head is at (3,2) and direction is L, it came from (4,2), which is the next segment, so that makes sense.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 2\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Priority is long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. But borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are inaccessible.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So, cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Snake body: positions from head to tail: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> Since the snake moves, when it moves, the tail will move away, so cells that are body now might be free later, except for the head which moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,2)\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can't move right (opposite) instantly. So possible moves: Up, Down, Left. But Left is the current direction, so moving left is fine.\n> \n> From (3,2), possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,3) – but (3,3) is occupied by snake body (it's the 4th segment in the list, index 3? Positions: index 0: head (3,2), index 1: (4,2), index 2: (4,3), index 3: (3,3), so (3,3) is body, so moving up to (3,3) would cause collision because head touches body immediately.\n> \n> Moving to a cell occupied by body is deadly, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away, but in this case, (3,3) is not the tail; tail is (6,1).\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a body segment, if it's not the tail, moving there causes collision. Only the tail cell is safe to move into because after move, tail moves forward and that cell is free.\n> \n> Let's identify the tail. Snake positions: (3,2) head, then (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n> \n> So tail is at (6,1). The segment before tail is (6,2), so when snake moves, tail will leave (6,1), so (6,1) will be free after move.\n> \n> But for other body segments, they don't move away immediately; only the tail does when snake grows or moves.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move; else, tail moves forward.\n> \n> But for collision, during movement: if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by body after the move, it's collision.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it's only safe if that body segment is the current tail, because after move, tail moves and that cell is free. If it's any other body segment, after move, that segment will still be there, so head collides with it.\n> \n> In this case, from head at (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left: (2,2) – is this occupied? Current positions: (3,2), (4,2), etc. (2,2) is not in the list, so probably free.\n> \n> List all occupied cells: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> So (2,2) is not there, so free? But we also have obstacles and walls.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (2,2) is x=2,y=2, which is within bounds, not border.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6) – none at (2,2), so (2,2) should be free.\n> \n> - Up: (3,3) – but (3,3) is in snake body, position index 3, and it's not the tail. Tail is (6,1). So moving to (3,3) would cause collision because after move, (3,3) will be the new position of the segment that was at (3,2), I think? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So:\n> \n> - New head position: where we move\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (was head) moves to where segment 1 was? Better to think indices.\n> \n> Let positions: S0: head, S1, S2, ..., S12: tail.\n> \n> After move, new S0 is the new head position, then S1 is old S0, S2 is old S1, ..., S12 is old S11, and old S12 (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by S_k, then after move, that cell will be occupied by S_{k-1} or something.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell that is currently S_k, for k=1 to 12, then after move, S_k moves to S_{k-1} position, so the cell is now occupied by S_{k-1}, which is body, so head collides with body.\n> \n> - Only if head moves to the current tail position S12, then after move, S12 is vacated, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,2), moving to:\n> \n> - Up: (3,3) – (3,3) is currently S3 (since S0:(3,2), S1:(4,2), S2:(4,3), S3:(3,3)). So moving to (3,3) which is S3 position. After move, head would be at (3,3), but S3 would move to where? Old positions: S0 to new head, S1 to old S0, S2 to old S1, S3 to old S2, etc. So the cell (3,3) will now have S3 which is moving to old S2 position? Messy.\n> \n> After move to (3,3):\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Then S1 (old head) moves to old S0 position: (3,2)? No.\n> \n> Standard: after moving head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So: new positions:\n> \n> - Head: new position, say P\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head position\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 position\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Segment k: old segment k-1 position\n> \n> - Tail: old second last segment position\n> \n> So the cell that was occupied by segment m will now be occupied by segment m-1 for m>0, and segment 0 (head) is gone.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by segment k (k >=1), then after move, that cell will be occupied by segment k-1 (which is still body, unless k-1=0 but k-1 >=0, for k=1, it would be segment 0, but segment 0 is head, which moved).\n> \n> Let's take k:\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell occupied by segment 1 (the neck), then after move, segment 1 moves to old head position, so that cell is now empty? No.\n> \n> Example: current head at H, segment 1 at P1.\n> \n> If head moves to P1, then after move:\n> \n> - New head at P1\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to H (old head position)\n> \n> - So the cell P1 now has new head, and H has segment 1.\n> \n> But P1 was occupied by segment 1, now it has head, so no issue? Head is at P1, and segment 1 is at H, so no collision at P1 because only head is there now.\n> \n> I think I confused myself.\n> \n> Collision happens if after the move, the head is on the same cell as a body segment.\n> \n> After move, for the new positions, if head cell is same as any body segment cell, then collision.\n> \n> In the case where head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment:\n> \n> - If that body segment was the tail, say T, then after move, tail moves away, so head is at T and no body segment is there, so no collision.\n> \n> - If that body segment was not the tail, say B, then after move, B moves to a new position, but the cell where head is now was B, and since B was not tail, there is some segment that moves to B's position? No.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - The cell where head moved to is now occupied only by head.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> So, the cell that was occupied by body segment k is now occupied by body segment k-1, for k from 1 to len-1, and the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - The cell that was head is now occupied by segment 1 (the neck)\n> \n> - The cell that was segment 1 is now occupied by segment 2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - The cell that was segment m is now occupied by segment m+1 for m < tail index\n> \n> - The cell that was tail is now empty.\n> \n> Therefore, if head moves to a cell that was:\n> \n> - Empty: no problem\n> \n> - Food: eat it, grow\n> \n> - Wall or obstacle: collision\n> \n> - Body segment:\n> \n> - If it was the tail cell, then after move, that cell is empty, so head can be there safely, and since tail moves, no collision.\n> \n> - If it was any other body segment, say segment k, then after move, that cell will be occupied by segment k-1 (which is body), so head and body segment k-1 are both on that cell, collision.\n> \n> In this case, for head at (3,2), moving to (3,3): (3,3) is currently segment S3 (index 3, not tail). Tail is S12 at (6,1). So (3,3) is occupied by S3. After move, if head goes to (3,3), then the cell (3,3) will be occupied by new head, but since S3 was there, S3 will move to where S2 was, which is (4,3), so (3,3) now has head, and no other segment is there, so it should be fine? I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Let's list current positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (3,2) head\n> \n> 1: (4,2)\n> \n> 2: (4,3)\n> \n> 3: (3,3)\n> \n> 4: (3,4)\n> \n> 5: (4,4)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)\n> \n> 9: (5,3)\n> \n> 10: (5,2)\n> \n> 11: (6,2)\n> \n> 12: (6,1) tail\n> \n> If head moves to (3,3), which is current position of S3.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head at (3,3)\n> \n> - S1 moves to old S0 position: (3,2)\n> \n> - S2 moves to old S1 position: (4,2)\n> \n> - S3 moves to old S2 position: (4,3)\n> \n> - S4 moves to old S3 position: (3,3) but (3,3) is now head, so S4 moves to (3,3)? No, S4 moves to old S3 position, which was (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by new head? Conflict.\n> \n> Positions after move:\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - New S1: old S0 = (3,2)\n> \n> - New S2: old S1 = (4,2)\n> \n> - New S3: old S2 = (4,3)\n> \n> - New S4: old S3 = (3,3)  but (3,3) is already new head position, so S4 cannot move to (3,3) because it's occupied, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, so moving to a body cell that is not the tail causes collision because the body segment that was there needs to move to that position, but it's taken by head.\n> \n> Only for tail, when head moves to tail position, after move, tail moves away, so no conflict.\n> \n> So in this case, for (3,2), moving up to (3,3) is invalid because (3,3) is body and not tail.\n> \n> Moving down: (3,1) – is this free?

Moving right to (4,2) would be moving to segment 1, which is not tail, so collision. Also, since current direction is L, moving right is opposite, which is not allowed instantly. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" so since current head direction is L, I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,2) with direction L:\n> \n> - U: (3,3) but occupied by body, not tail, so deadly\n> \n> - D: (3,1) – let's check if free and safe\n> \n> - L: (2,2) – free and safe?\n> \n> - R: not possible, reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> So only D or L are possible.\n> \n> Now, (3,1): is it accessible?

This is mandatory because:\n  - The food at (4,1) will disappear after this turn.\n  - No other moves are possible (all other directions are blocked by walls or the snake's body).\n  - Eating the food increases the snake's length by 1 (no tail reward danger since the tail is far away at (6,2)).\n\n### Verification of Safety:\n- After moving to (4,1), the new head position is (4,1), and the snake's body grows to length 14.\n- The next move (Turn 75) will be from (4,1), direction Right (since the snake just moved Right).

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2).

So it will disappear after turn 76 (since turn 74 current, so turns left: 74,75,76? Countdown: at turn 74, life span 1, so after turn 74, it's gone. Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N, it appears at some turn, and disappears after N turns from now or from spawn? The state gives current life span, so for (4,1), life span 1, meaning at the end of turn 74, it will disappear if not eaten. Similarly, (1,5) life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 76? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose food spawns at turn S with life span L. At turn T, remaining life is L - (T - S). But here, we're given the current life span at turn 74. For (4,1), life span 1, so at turn 74, it has 1 turn left, meaning after this turn (turn 74), it disappears. Similarly, (1,5) life span 3, so it has 3 turns left including current, so it will disappear after turn 76.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn including current, so for (4,1), life span 1: at turn 74, countdown is 1, after turn 74, it becomes 0 and disappears. For (1,5), life span 3: at turn 74, countdown 3; turn 75, countdown 2; turn 76, countdown 1; after turn 76, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 74, 75, or 76.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 6, disappears after turn 79.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 9, disappears after turn 82.\n> \n> All food has value 1, positive, since it says value1 for all, and in the description, positive food is +1, negative is -1, but here all are value1, so all positive? Let's check: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (4, 1, 1, 1) - (1, 5, 3, 1) - (1, 1, 6, 1) - (2, 5, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> The format is (x, y, value, life_span) I think. For (4,1): x=4,y=1,value=1,life_span=1\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5,3,1) is x=1,y=5,value=3? No, it says value and life span, but in the text: \"(4, 1, 1, 1)\" and it says \"value1, life_span1\", but for (1,5,3,1), it might be x=1,y=5, value=3, life_span=1? That doesn't make sense because value should be +1 or -1, but here it says 3? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 1, 1, 1) - (1, 5, 3, 1) - (1, 1, 6, 1) - (2, 5, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think there's a misunderstanding. Probably, it's (x, y, life_span, value) or (x, y, value, life_span)? In the first one, (4,1,1,1) could be x=4,y=1, value=1, life_span=1 or x=4,y=1, life_span=1, value=1? But for (1,5,3,1), if value=3, that might be possible, but in the core rules, food has value +1 or -1, but it doesn't say it can't be other values? Let's check core rules.\n> \n> \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\", so values are +1 or -1. But here, for (1,5,3,1), the third number is 3, which might be life_span, and fourth is value? Let's see the pattern.\n> \n> First food: (4,1,1,1) — likely x=4,y=1, value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> Second: (1,5,3,1) — x=1,y=5, value=3? But value should be +1 or -1, 3 is odd. Or perhaps it's x=1,y=5, life_span=3, value=1? That makes sense because it says \"Life Span and Value\", so probably (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)?\n> \n> In the first one, (4,1,1,1), if value=1, life_span=1, or life_span=1, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5,3,1) — if life_span=3, value=1, or value=3, life_span=1.\n> \n> But value=3 contradicts core rules. Core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1. So likely, it's (x,y, life_span, value), so for (1,5,3,1) means x=1,y=5, life_span=3, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1,6,1) x=1,y=1, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (2,5,9,1) x=2,y=5, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> And (4,1,1,1) x=4,y=1, life_span=1, value=1\n> \n> Yes, all value 1, positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,1), direction Down. Moving down would go to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down is invalid because it hits the wall.\n> \n> Current head position (3,1), direction Down. If I move Down, to (3,0), but y=0 is border wall, so it's a wall collision, which is deadly. So I cannot move Down.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is Down, I cannot move Up next, because Up is opposite to Down.\n> \n> Current head direction is Down, so possible moves: since I cannot reverse to Up, and Down is wall, so I can only move Left or Right? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Head at (3,1). Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,2) - but that's the snake's body, second segment.

Snake positions: all from (5,1) to (3,1) etc., (6,1) not listed, so should be empty.\n> \n> But let's confirm snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), ... no (6,1), so (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Also, walls: border x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok, y=1 is between 0 and 7, but y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is ok.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - U: to (5,2) - currently tail, will be safe as tail moves\n> \n> - D: to (5,0) - y=0 wall, invalid, death\n> \n> - L: to (4,1) - body segment, collision, death\n> \n> - R: to (6,1) - empty, safe\n> \n> But also, since current direction is R, I cannot move L, which is opposite, so L is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U, R.

From (5,1) to (1,5) is distance |5-1| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8 moves away, impossible to reach this turn. So it will disappear after this turn if not eaten, but since no one can eat it probably, it will vanish.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,1) is closer, at (1,1), which is left and down, but from (5,1), it's |5-1| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away, but with obstacles.\n> \n> (2,5) at (2,5), |5-2| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves.\n> \n> (6,3) at (6,3), |5-6| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3 moves, but not direct path.\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, head at (5,1), so to go to (6,3), I need to move right or up, etc.\n> \n> But let's consider options for turn 76.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (5,2)\n> \n> After moving to (5,2), the snake head is at (5,2), which was the tail. The tail was (5,2), but when head moves to (5,2), since it eats nothing (no food there), the snake moves, tail moves away, so the new head is (5,2), and the segment that was at (5,2) is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is removed. But here, since head moves to a cell that was tail, but tail will move, so the cell is free after move.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new position. If it eats food, tail doesn't move (snake grows), else tail moves (snake length same).\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,2): (5,2) is currently occupied by tail, but there is no food at (5,2), so when head moves to (5,2), it does not eat food (since no food there), so the tail should move, meaning the last segment is removed, and head is at (5,2). But (5,2) was the tail, so it's a bit confusing.\n> \n> Typically: the snake moves forward. The head goes to a new cell. If that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and length increases. If no food, the tail is removed, so length same.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell that was occupied by tail, since tail is about to be removed, it's ok, no collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,1) to (5,2): (5,2) is the current tail position. After move, head is at (5,2), and since no food eaten (assuming no food at (5,2)), the tail is removed. The tail was at (5,2), so it's removed, and the new tail is the previous second-last segment, which is (5,3)? Let's list snake positions.\n> \n> Current snake: positions in order: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,5), 10: (5,5), 11: (5,4), 12: (5,3), 13: (5,2) tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (5,2), which is current tail position. Since no food at (5,2), after move, the new head is (5,2), and tail is removed, so the new snake positions: head (5,2), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) — (5,3) is now tail? Previous positions: after head moves to (5,2), the segments shift: the new body includes (5,1) as first body segment, and (5,3) becomes the new tail, since (5,2) was tail and removed.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the second segment moves to where head was, and so on, tail moves to where second-last was.\n> \n> So after moving head to (5,2):\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Then new body: (5,1) [previous head], then (4,1) [previous second], then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and tail: (5,3) [previous second-last]\n> \n> Previous positions: head (5,1), body: (4,1), (3,1), ..., (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> After move U to (5,2): new head (5,2), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and tail (5,3). So length is 14, same as before.\n> \n> (5,3) is now tail.\n> \n> Direction: head was moving R to (5,1), but after move U, new direction is U.\n> \n> If move R to (6,1): new head (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), etc., tail (5,3).\n> \n> Now, for turn 76, I have two choices: U or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2), what happens? Head at (5,2), direction U.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is now the tail? In new position, (5,3) is tail, so moving to (5,3) is safe.\n> \n> D to (5,1), but (5,1) is now body segment (first body), so collision.\n> \n> L to (4,2), what is at (4,2)? In new positions, (4,2) is a body segment? Let's see new positions after move U:\n> \n> Head: (5,2)\n> \n> Body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), tail (5,3)\n> \n> So (4,2) is the 5th segment, body, so moving L to (4,2) would be collision.\n> \n> R to (6,2), which is empty, I assume.\n> \n> (6,2) not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so safe.\n> \n> So from (5,2) after U move, possible moves: U to (5,3) - tail, safe; R to (6,2) - empty; D and L not possible or collision.\n> \n> D to (5,1) is body, collision; L to (4,2) is body, collision.\n> \n> So only U or R.\n> \n> If I move R on turn 76 to (6,1): head at (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> Then from (6,1), possible moves: U to (6,2), D to (6,0) wall, invalid; L to (5,1) which is now body segment (since after move, body includes (5,1)), so collision; R to (7,1) which is x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move from (6,1) is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (6,3) where there is food.\n> \n> But let's think about food and risks.\n> \n> First, (1,5) food with life span 1: it will disappear after this turn since no one can eat it now. Distance too far.\n> \n> (1,1) food at (1,1), life span 4, so it will disappear in 4 turns if not eaten.\n> \n> From current position (5,1), to reach (1,1), I need to go left. But with obstacles at (2,1), which is on the way.\n> \n> (2,1) is obstacle, so from (5,1), I can't go directly left because (4,1) is body, (3,1) is body, and (2,1) is obstacle, so the only way to (1,1) is to go around, but it might take more than 4 turns, and life span is 4, meaning it disappears after turn 76+4=80, so if not eaten by turn 80, it vanishes. But turn 76 current, so it can be eaten on turn 76,77,78,79? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,1), life span 4, at turn 76, it has 4 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 79? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, when we are about to move, the food has a life span L, then after this turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard: at the start of turn t, food has life span L, then after the snake moves (and if it eats, food is consumed), if not eaten, at end of turn, life span decreases by 1. If it reaches 0, it disappears before next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if snake head moves to the cell on its turn, it eats it.\n> \n> For (1,1) at turn 76, life span 4, so it can be eaten on turns 76,77,78,79. After turn 79, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 1, can be eaten only on turn 76, else disappears.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 7, can be eaten from turn 76 to 82.\n> \n> (6,3) life span 10, many turns.\n> \n> Now, (6,3) is close, at (6,3), head at (5,1), distance |6-5| + |3-1| =1+2=3, so I can reach it in 3 moves if I go directly.\n> \n> For example, from (5,1), move R to (6,1), then U to (6,2), then U to (6,3), and eat on turn 78? Turn 76: move to (6,1), turn 77: move to (6,2), turn 78: move to (6,3) and eat.\n> \n> But after moving to (6,1), on turn 77, from (6,1), only U to (6,2) is possible, as we saw earlier.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), head at (6,2), direction U (since moved up from (6,1)?

No, length same, tail moves.\n> \n> After head moves to (6,1), the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to previous head position (5,1), second to where first was, and so on, so the tail segment (5,2) is left, removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,1), then body: (5,1) [previous head], (4,1) [previous first body], (3,1) [previous second], (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and new tail (5,3) [previous second-last].\n> \n> So positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) — 14 segments, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Then on turn 77, move U to (6,2): new head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), tail (5,3)?

So U is possible.\n> \n> - Down: (6,0) – y=0, which is border wall. Cannot go down.\n> \n> - Right: (7,1) – x=7, which is border wall. Cannot go right.\n> \n> - Left: (5,1) – but (5,1) is the first body segment. Also, cannot go left because it's instant reverse from current direction R.\n> \n> Cannot go left or right or down? Only up is possible?\n> \n> Current direction is R, so moving to (5,1) would be left, which is opposite, so not allowed. Similarly, down to (6,0) is wall, right to (7,1) is wall. Only up to (6,2) seems possible.\n> \n> But let's confirm: from (6,1), moving up to (6,2).\n> \n> Is (6,2) occupied? Snake positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). No (6,2), so yes, free.\n> \n> Also, no wall there.\n> \n> So only possible move is U? That can't be right, or is it?\n> \n> Perhaps I missed something. Direction constraint: no instant reverse, so from R, cannot go L. U and D are perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> But down is wall, right is wall, so indeed only up is possible? But that seems risky because after moving up, I might be trapped.\n> \n> Current position (6,1), head direction R.\n> \n> After moving, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves, so the body changes.\n> \n> If I move up to (6,2), then new head position (6,2), and the tail (5,3) will move away? Let's see.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So if I move up to (6,2), new positions: head (6,2), then body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). The last segment (5,3) is gone, since tail moves.\n> \n> Original positions: indices from head: 0: (6,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (5,4), 13: (5,3)\n> \n> After moving U to (6,2):\n> \n> New head: (6,2)\n> \n> Then new body: position of old head becomes new segment 1: (6,1)\n> \n> Old segment 1 becomes new segment 2: (5,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to old segment 12 becomes new segment 13: (5,4)\n> \n> Old segment 13 (5,3) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> Length still 14, no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, from (6,2), what can I do?\n> \n> But I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, at turn 77, only U seems possible? But let's double-check.\n> \n> From (6,1), with direction R.\n> \n> - Move U: to (6,2) - possible\n> \n> - Move D: to (6,0) - y=0, wall, invalid\n> \n> - Move R: to (7,1) - x=7, wall, invalid\n> \n> - Move L: to (5,1) - but (5,1) is body, and also instant reverse, since current direction R, moving left is opposite, so invalid.\n> \n> So indeed, only U is possible for turn 77. I have to go up.\n> \n> Then for turn 78, head at (6,2), direction now U (since I moved up).\n> \n> From (6,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But direction U, so cannot move D (down, opposite).\n> \n> - U: to (6,3) - is there food? (6,3) is a food position! Food at (6,3) with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> But is (6,3) safe? Let's see.\n> \n> (6,3): not a wall. Snake positions after move to (6,2): head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), etc. as above. (6,3) is not in the body list, so it should be free.\n> \n> But (6,3) has food, so if I move to (6,3), I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> Also, check if adjacent to tail: tail is at (5,4) after the move? After moving to (6,2), tail is (5,4).\n> \n> (6,3) and (5,4) are not adjacent; (6,3) is up from head, (5,4) is left and down? Positions: (6,3) and (5,4): delta x=1, delta y=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, distance 1.\n> \n> So not adjacent to tail, so eating should be fine.\n> \n> But let's confirm the move sequence.\n> \n> First, turn 77: must go U to (6,2). No choice.\n> \n> Then turn 78: from (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Can go:\n> \n> - U to (6,3): possible, and has food.\n> \n> - L to (5,2): need to check if free.\n> \n> - R to (7,2): x=7, border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (6,1): but (6,1) is now the second segment, after moving to (6,2), (6,1) is the neck, so moving down would be to (6,1), which is body, collision. Also, direction U, moving D is opposite, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> Direction U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> Cannot move R to wall.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2): is it free? After move to (6,2), snake positions: head (6,2), segments: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> (5,2) not in list, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> Also, no food at (5,2), I think.\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (2,5), (6,3).\n> \n> So from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) to eat food, or L to (5,2) to avoid eating for now.\n> \n> But eating food is good, but I need to think long-term.\n> \n> (6,3) has life span 9, so it will be there for a while, but since I'm close, I can eat it now.\n> \n> But let's see the risks.\n> \n> If I eat at (6,3), snake grows to length 15.\n> \n> After eating, new head at (6,3), and the tail doesn't move, so body segments: head (6,3), then previous head (6,2) becomes segment 1, then (6,1), (5,1), etc., and tail remains (5,4) since no move, growth.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when head moves to food, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> So after moving to (6,3) and eating:\n> \n> Head: (6,3)\n> \n> Then: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and a new segment added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell with food, the new head is at food cell, and the body follows as usual, but since tail didn't move, the segment before tail is now the new tail, but we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so length increases.\n> \n> Initial positions before move: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), ..., (5,4) as tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,3):\n> \n> New head: (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head position (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 2: old segment 1 (6,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 14: old segment 13 (5,4)\n> \n> Then, since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position of the old tail, so new segment 15: (5,4) — but (5,4) is now segment 14? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: segments S0: (6,2) head, S1: (6,1), S2: (5,1), ..., S13: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After move without food: head to new cell, say C, then S0 to C, S1 to old S0, S2 to old S1, ..., S13 to old S12, and old S13 vacated.\n> \n> But with food, after moving head to food cell, the tail does not vacate; instead, the tail stays, and we add a new segment at the tail position, so the new tail is the old tail, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> So positions: new S0: (6,3)\n> \n> New S1: old S0 (6,2)\n> \n> New S2: old S1 (6,1)\n> \n> New S3: old S2 (5,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New S14: old S13 (5,4)  // this was the tail\n> \n> Then, since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, which is now occupied by S14, so new S15: same as S14 position?

That can't be.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, head moves to food cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not move, meaning that the last segment (tail) stays in place, and a new segment is added at that position, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> So in terms of positions:\n> \n> After moving to (6,3) with food:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,2)  // old head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (6,1)  // old segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,1)  // old segment 2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Segment 14: (5,4)  // old segment 13 (which was the tail before, but now it's segment 14)\n> \n> - Segment 15: (5,4)  // new segment added at old tail position\n> \n> But two segments at (5,4)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Perhaps: when eating, the head moves to food, the body follows, but the tail does not advance, so the segment that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added there, but in the chain, the positions are updated.\n> \n> Let's think differently.\n> \n> Before move: positions: H: (6,2), B1: (6,1), B2: (5,1), B3: (4,1), B4: (3,1), B5: (3,2), B6: (4,2), B7: (4,3), B8: (3,3), B9: (3,4), B10: (4,4), B11: (4,5), B12: (5,5), B13: (5,4)  tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,3) without eating: new H: (6,3), B1: (6,2), B2: (6,1), B3: (5,1), ..., B13: (5,5), and tail at (5,5), (5,4) vacated.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to (6,3), then the body segments move to the previous positions, so B1 to (6,2), B2 to (6,1), ..., B13 to (5,4), but since eating, the tail doesn't move, so B13 stays at (5,4), and a new segment is added at (5,4), so now the snake has head at (6,3), then segments at (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and new segment at (5,4), so two at (5,4)? No.\n> \n> The new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, which is (5,4).\n> \n> After the move, the position (5,4) is still occupied by the tail, but the tail is now the new segment.\n> \n> Let's read the rules.\n> \n> From the core rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food. And \"the tail will also move forward\" except when eating.\n> \n> But in the description, it says for food under body, it can be eaten when body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> But for growth, I think when head eats food, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by keeping the tail in place and adding a new segment there.\n> \n> So in this case, before move, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> After head moves to (6,3), the body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,2) moves to (6,3)? No.\n> \n> The head moves to new position, each body segment takes the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So after move to (6,3) with eating:\n> \n> - New head position: (6,3)\n> \n> - New position of first body segment: old head position (6,2)\n> \n> - New position of second body segment: old first body position (6,1)\n> \n> - New position of third body segment: old second body position (5,1)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New position of 14th body segment: old 13th body position (5,4)  // this was the tail\n> \n> Then, because of eating, a new segment is added, so there is a 15th segment at the position of the old tail, which is (5,4). But (5,4) is now occupied by the new 14th segment? No.\n> \n> The new 14th segment is at (5,4), and the new segment is added at the same position? That's duplicate.\n> \n> I think I have it: when eating, the tail does not move, so the last position is not vacated; instead, the new tail is at the old tail position, and the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Positions after eating:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,2)  // old head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (6,1)  // old segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,1)  // old segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,1)  // old segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,1)  // old segment 4\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,2)  // old segment 5\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,2)  // old segment 6\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,3)  // old segment 7\n> \n> - Segment 9: (3,3)  // old segment 8\n> \n> - Segment 10: (3,4)  // old segment 9\n> \n> - Segment 11: (4,4)  // old segment 10\n> \n> - Segment 12: (4,5)  // old segment 11\n> \n> - Segment 13: (5,5)  // old segment 12\n> \n> - Segment 14: (5,4)  // old segment 13 (tail, now segment 14)\n> \n> - Segment 15: (5,4)  // new segment at old tail position\n> \n> But segment 14 and 15 both at (5,4), which is impossible.\n> \n> That can't be right.\n> \n> I think the correct way is: when the snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments move as usual, but the tail segment does not advance, so it stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position before the move, but since the tail doesn't move, it's like the tail is duplicated or something.\n> \n> I recall that in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> For example, if tail is at P, after move, tail is still at P, and the new position is added.\n> \n> In terms of positions list, when you eat, you do not remove the tail position; you keep it and add the new head position.\n> \n> Before move: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to a new cell C with food: new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  // T is kept, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Yes, that's it.\n> \n> So in this case, before move to (6,3): positions [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]  head (6,2), tail (5,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,3) and eating: new positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]  head (6,3), tail (5,4)\n> \n> Tail is still (5,4), but now it's the last segment, and there is an additional segment at (5,5)? Let's see: the new list has (6,3) as head, then old head (6,2), then old B1 (6,1), old B2 (5,1), ..., old B12 (5,5), old tail (5,4). So positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> So tail at (5,4), and (5,5) is also occupied.\n> \n> No duplicate, all positions unique.\n> \n> Now, back to the decision.\n> \n> At turn 78, from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) to eat food, or L to (5,2).\n> \n> If I go U, I eat the food at (6,3), and snake grows to 15.\n> \n> Then from there, I need to move.\n> \n> If I go L to (5,2), no food, snake doesn't grow, tail moves.\n> \n> But (6,3) food has life span 9, so it will be there for a while, but since I'm at (6,2), I can eat it now or later.\n> \n> But later might be risky.\n> \n> Also, there are other foods: (1,1) with life span 4, so only 4 turns including turn 77, so it disappears after turn 80. Turn 77 is current, so life span 4 means: after 4 turns, it disappears. If life span N, it disappears after N turns, including current, so on turn t, food with life span L will disappear on turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, then at turn t, countdown L, turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., turn t+L-1, countdown 1, then on turn t+L, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (1,1), life span 4, turn 77: countdown 4, turn 78:3, turn 79:2, turn 80:1, turn 81: gone?

It's turn 78. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with some internal blocks.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,2), then body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4).

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 78, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 80? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after (t + L - 1) or something? Better to think: at turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N turns, it's gone. For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it becomes N-1; after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t+N-1, it has 1, then after turn t+N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n> \n> In this case, turn 78:\n> \n> - Food at (1,1): value 1, life span 3. So can be eaten on turns 78, 79, 80. Disappears after turn 80? Turn 78: life span 3, after turn 78: life span 2, after turn 79: life span 1, after turn 80: life span 0, gone.

But even if allowed, (6,1) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail? Tail is at (5,4), so (6,1) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (6,1) would cause collision, death.\n> \n> But since reverse is not allowed, we can skip D.\n> \n> - L: (5,2) – what is at (5,2)? Not in snake positions: positions are (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), etc., no (5,2). Also not an obstacle. Obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6), not (5,2). So (5,2) should be free.\n> \n> - R: (7,2) – but x=7 is wall, since border cells x=7 are walls. So (7,2) is out of bounds, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, food: (6,3) has food with life span 8, so plenty of time.

In fact, impossible because even if all cells were free, Manhattan distance is 5 in x and 1 in y, so 6 moves, but we have only 2 moves after this turn (turn 79 and 80) to be there on turn 80, but on turn 78 I am at (6,2), after move on turn 78, I can be at (6,3) or (5,2), both not closer really.\n> \n> From (5,2), still far from (1,1).\n> \n> So it's impossible to eat the food at (1,1) because I can't reach it in time.

Food at (3,4) and others, but not (5,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is food but occupied by body.\n> \n> So from (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (5,4): empty, safe\n> \n> - Left to (4,3): but (4,3) is body segment, collision, not safe\n> \n> - Right to (6,3): food, and not occupied by body? (6,3) not in snake positions, so safe to move there, and eat food.\n> \n> But need to check if eating is possible. Since (6,3) is not under body, it should be eatable directly.\n> \n> Now, down is not possible due to reverse.\n> \n> So only two possible moves: Up or Right.\n> \n> Right to (6,3) has food, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n> \n> Up to (5,4) no food, just move.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,1) with life span 1, meaning if not eaten this turn, it disappears. But (1,1) is far, I'm at (5,3), and I can only move one step, so impossible to reach (1,1) this turn. So it will disappear anyway; no point considering it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, let's list all foods and their positions:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 1 (gone after this turn)\n> \n> - (2,5): value 1, life span 3 (gone after turn 82)\n> \n> - (6,3): value 1, life span 6 (gone after turn 85)\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life span 9 (gone after turn 88)\n> \n> But (3,4) is currently occupied by snake body at position 11. So to eat it, the body must move away and head move there.\n> \n> Now, current turn 80.\n> \n> I need to plan sequence for at least 5 turns: turn 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, etc.\n> \n> But since life spans, I should consider up to turn 85 or so.\n> \n> First, at turn 80, from head (5,3), I can go:\n> \n> Option A: Right to (6,3) to eat the food there.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new head at (6,3), and tail stays, but since it grows, a new segment is added at tail? When you eat, length increases, so after move, head moves to (6,3), and since ate food, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes longer.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, and tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Then next turn, when you move, tail moves, etc.\n> \n> But here, when you eat, the new segment is added, but the tail position doesn't change immediately; it stays for that turn, then when snake moves, tail moves.\n> \n> But for collision, we need to see the positions after move.\n> \n> Now, if I move right to (6,3), I eat the food, so new snake head at (6,3), and the body: the previous head (5,3) becomes new segment 1, and so on, tail (4,5) still there, but since I ate, the tail doesn't advance, so positions: new head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — and since ate, length is now 15, so tail is still (4,5), but after this move, when I move next, the tail will move.\n> \n> For the state after move, positions are updated.\n> \n> After moving to (6,3) and eating, the snake positions become: head (6,3), then the previous segments from index 0 to 13, but since head moved, the new list is: new head (6,3), then the old head (5,3) becomes neck, then (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). So 14 segments? Original 14, ate one, so should be 15 segments.\n> \n> Original positions: 14 segments.\n> \n> After eating: head moves to new position (6,3), and the tail does not move, so the body includes all previous positions plus the head moved, so the segment that was head is now body, and tail stays. So positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) ] — that's 15 positions, yes.\n> \n> Tail is (4,5).\n> \n> Direction: since I moved right, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, if I go up to (5,4), no food, so snake moves, head to (5,4), tail moves away, so positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ] — tail was (4,5), which moves off, so the new tail is (4,4)? Let's see: after moving up, head to (5,4), the segment (5,3) becomes body, (5,2) body, ..., up to (4,4), and (4,5) is removed since no growth. Original positions: head (5,3), then 13 body segments ending with tail (4,5). After move without eating, head moves to (5,4), and tail moves off, so the new positions are [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ] — so 14 segments, tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Direction U.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 80 choices.\n> \n> If I go right to (6,3), I eat food, get +1, and snake longer.\n> \n> But (6,3) is available now, life span 6, but I can eat it now.\n> \n> If I go up to (5,4), no food, but I might go for other foods later.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (3,4) under body, which I might eat later if I can.\n> \n> But (3,4) is current body segment, and life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) life span 3, so need to eat by turn 82.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid to plan path.\n> \n> I should sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls on borders, so accessible x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7 for all y; all y=0, y=7 for all x.\n> \n> Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So free cells: from (1,1) to (6,6) minus obstacles.\n> \n> (1,1) is food, but also, is (1,1) accessible? y=1, x=1, not wall, not obstacle?

It's turn 81, and I'm the AI playing Snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6). So I must avoid those cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,3), then body segments at (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). That's 15 segments, so the snake is 15 units long.\n> \n> The head direction is R, which means right, so the snake is moving to the right. Last move was to the right, so current head is at (6,3), moving right.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - One at (2,5) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 81, it will disappear after turn 83? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 81, life span is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left: turn 81, 82, 83. After turn 83, it's gone. Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> - Another food at (3,4) with value 1 and life span 8. Value is 1 for both, so both are positive food, since value is +1. The notation says \"value1\" and \"value2\" are both 1, so positive.\n> \n> But look at the food at (3,4): (3,4) is listed in the snake positions. Snake positions include (3,4) as the 13th segment? Let's list the snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index: 0: (6,3) head\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,2)\n> \n> 3: (6,2)\n> \n> 4: (6,1)\n> \n> 5: (5,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,1)\n> \n> 7: (3,1)\n> \n> 8: (3,2)\n> \n> 9: (4,2)\n> \n> 10: (4,3)\n> \n> 11: (3,3)\n> \n> 12: (3,4)  <-- here\n> \n> 13: (4,4)\n> \n> 14: (4,5)\n> \n> And food is at (3,4) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> But (3,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body segment. Specifically, it's the 12th segment in the list, which is position (3,4).\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So this food at (3,4) is under the snake now. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body segment leaves (3,4), and then the head moves to (3,4).\n> \n> But the life span is 8, so it has 8 turns left, including this one. Turn 81 to 88? Life span 8 at turn 81 means it will be there until after turn 88? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it has N turns left: it will disappear after N turns, so last chance to eat is on turn t + N - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span is 1, it disappears after this turn, so must eat on turn t. If life span is 2, it has this turn and next turn, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> General: with life span L at turn t, the food is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive. It disappears at the start of turn t + L.\n> \n> For (2,5): life span 3 at turn 81, so available on turns 81, 82, 83. Disappears at turn 84.\n> \n> For (3,4): life span 8 at turn 81, so available turns 81 to 88, disappears at turn 89.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,4) is under the snake body. Specifically, at position (3,4), which is occupied by a body segment.\n> \n> To eat it, we need that segment to move away, and head to move in.\n> \n> But currently, head is at (6,3), which is far from (3,4). So it might take several moves to get there.\n> \n> Also, there's a Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail position: the last segment is (4,5), which is the tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) is not on the tail; it's on a body segment. (3,4) is position 12, and tail is (4,5) position 14. So it's not the tail.\n> \n> But if we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows. But the danger is only if food is on tail and head adjacent.\n> \n> Here, food is not on tail, so no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, but since the grid is small and snake is long, I need to think about survival and pathing.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake positions: let's plot them to see the shape.\n> \n> Head: (6,3)\n> \n> Then: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so from (6,3), moving right would go to (7,3), but x=7 is a wall, so moving right is invalid? x=7 is border wall, so (7,3) is out of bounds, can't go there.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0,7 etc.\n> \n> So at (6,3), possible moves: since head direction is R, but we can change direction, except no instant reverse, so cannot go left (opposite of right).\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so last move was right, so we cannot move left immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1), but R to (7,3) is wall, so not possible.

Old seg12 was at (3,4), and now it's new seg13 at (3,4), so (3,4) is still occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> New seg13 is at (3,4), which is from old seg12.\n> \n> So (3,4) is still occupied by the snake.\n> \n> The food is at (3,4), so it remains under the body.\n> \n> To eat it, we need to move so that this segment leaves (3,4).\n> \n> But it might take time.\n> \n> Now, after turn 81, we moved U to (6,4), head now at (6,4), direction is U (since we moved up).\n> \n> Now, for turn 82, we need to choose next action.\n> \n> But I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (2,5) with life span 3, but at turn 81, life span 3, so after turn 81, at turn 82, what is the life span?\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current turn when we get the state.\n> \n> The state is given at turn 81, with food having life spans.\n> \n> After we move, it's turn 82, and all food life spans decrease by 1.\n> \n> So at turn 82, food at (2,5) will have life span 2, and (3,4) has life span 7.\n> \n> But let's focus on the immediate situation.\n> \n> At turn 81, we must move U to (6,4), as it's the only choice.\n> \n> Then at turn 82, head at (6,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: since last move was U, we cannot move D (down, reverse).\n> \n> Possible: U (up to (6,5)), D (down to (6,3), but reverse, not allowed), L (left to (5,4)), R (right to (7,4), but x=7 wall, invalid).\n> \n> So possible: U or L.\n> \n> Now, (6,5): is it free? Current positions after move: head (6,4), seg1 (6,3), etc. (6,5) not in positions, not wall or obstacle. Obstacles: (3,6), etc., (6,5) not among, so should be free.\n> \n> (5,4): similarly, not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> So both U and L are possible.\n> \n> I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) is at (2,5), which is near the top-left.\n> \n> (2,5): x=2,y=5.\n> \n> Current head at (6,4), so we need to go left and up.\n> \n> But there are obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3) are obstacles, but (2,5) is at y=5, so above.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,4) is under snake, at (3,4), which is occupied.\n> \n> (3,4) is currently seg13 in new positions, but we need to free it.\n> \n> The segment at (3,4) will move when the snake moves, but it depends on the path.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, moving to eat (2,5) might be tricky due to life span.\n> \n> At turn 82, after we move to (6,4), food (2,5) has life span 2 left, meaning it can be eaten on turn 82 or 83, disappears at turn 84.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But (2,5) is urgent.\n> \n> Path to (2,5): from (6,4) to (2,5).\n> \n> Possible moves: we can go left or up from (6,4).\n> \n> If we go up to (6,5), then from there, we can go left to (5,5), etc., but need to avoid walls and self.\n> \n> Grid: let's list free cells or something.\n> \n> Since time is short, let's see if we can reach (2,5) in 2 moves.\n> \n> From (6,4) to (2,5): Manhattan distance |6-2| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5, so at least 5 moves away, but we have only 2 turns to eat it? Turn 82 and 83 to eat, since disappears at turn 84.\n> \n> At turn 82, head at (6,4), if we move towards it, but in 2 moves, we can reach at best (4,5) or (5,5), not (2,5).\n> \n> For example, from (6,4), move L to (5,4), then turn 83 move U to (5,5), but (5,5) is not (2,5).\n> \n> Or from (6,4) move U to (6,5), then L to (5,5).\n> \n> (5,5) is far from (2,5).\n> \n> To go left, we need multiple left moves.\n> \n> But the grid has obstacles: for example, to go to (2,5), we might go via (4,4), but (4,4) is currently occupied? After turn 81 move, positions include (4,4) as tail? New tail is at (4,4), so occupied.\n> \n> At turn 82, after possible moves.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, at turn 81, we must do U.\n> \n> Then for turn 82, we have choices.\n> \n> But for the food at (2,5), since it's 5 cells away, and we have only 2 turns (82 and 83) to eat it, it's impossible to reach in 2 moves. Minimum moves needed: from (6,4) to (2,5), Δx = -4, Δy = +1, so at least 5 moves if we move directly, but we can only make 2 moves by turn 83, so we can only reach, say, (4,5) or (5,5), which are not (2,5). So it's impossible to eat (2,5) before it disappears. Therefore, we should ignore it and focus on other things.\n> \n> Life span at turn 81: 3, so available turns 81,82,83.\n> \n> At turn 81, head is at (6,3), which is not adjacent to (2,5), and we move to (6,4), still not adjacent.\n> \n> Then turn 82, head at (6,4), we can move, but to (2,5) is too far. Even if we could go directly, it takes 4 left and 1 up, but in two moves, we can do at most two left or one left and one up, reaching (4,5) or (5,5), not (2,5). So indeed, impossible to eat (2,5). So forget about it.\n> \n> Now, focus on the food at (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is currently occupied by snake body, and it has life span 8, so available until turn 88.\n> \n> We need to free the cell (3,4) and then move head there.\n> \n> (3,4) is occupied by a body segment, which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> The segment at (3,4) is part of the body, and its position will change as the snake moves.\n> \n> To free (3,4), we need to move in such a way that the segment leaves that cell.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so to free (3,4), we need that the segment that is currently at (3,4) moves to a different position, and no other segment moves to (3,4) immediately, but since segments move sequentially, when a segment leaves a cell, it might be free for a moment.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail leaves its cell, so cells can be freed.\n> \n> But for (3,4), it's not the tail; it's an internal segment.\n> \n> In this case, after the move at turn 81, (3,4) is still occupied by new seg13.\n> \n> At turn 82, when we move again, that segment will move to a new position.\n> \n> Let's denote the positions after turn 81 move:\n> \n> Head: (6,4)\n> \n> Seg1: (6,3)\n> \n> Seg2: (5,3)\n> \n> Seg3: (5,2)\n> \n> Seg4: (6,2)\n> \n> Seg5: (6,1)\n> \n> Seg6: (5,1)\n> \n> Seg7: (4,1)\n> \n> Seg8: (3,1)\n> \n> Seg9: (3,2)\n> \n> Seg10: (4,2)\n> \n> Seg11: (4,3)\n> \n> Seg12: (3,3)\n> \n> Seg13: (3,4)  // this is the one with food\n> \n> Seg14: (4,4)  // tail\n> \n> Now, at turn 82, we move the head from (6,4) to a new position.\n> \n> Suppose we move U to (6,5).\n> \n> Then new head: (6,5)\n> \n> Seg1: old head (6,4)\n> \n> Seg2: old seg1 (6,3)\n> \n> Seg3: old seg2 (5,3)\n> \n> Seg4: old seg3 (5,2)\n> \n> Seg5: old seg4 (6,2)\n> \n> Seg6: old seg5 (6,1)\n> \n> Seg7: old seg6 (5,1)\n> \n> Seg8: old seg7 (4,1)\n> \n> Seg9: old seg8 (3,1)\n> \n> Seg10: old seg9 (3,2)\n> \n> Seg11: old seg10 (4,2)\n> \n> Seg12: old seg11 (4,3)\n> \n> Seg13: old seg12 (3,3)  // new position for this segment\n> \n> Seg14: old seg13 (3,4)  // now tail?

That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think there's a confusion.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So the new head position is the food cell, and the tail remains in place, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> But if the food is on the tail cell, then head moves to tail cell, eats food, and since tail doesn't move, the new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail position is the same as the new head position, so it would have two segments at the same point, which is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, it's not allowed to eat food that is on the tail cell, because it causes immediate collision.\n> \n> The rule mentions: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\" But for tail, it might be special.\n> \n> The \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifically: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, head is on food, tail doesn't move, new segment added at tail, so head and new segment are adjacent or something.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, this is when head is adjacent to tail, not on the same cell.\n> \n> For example, if head is next to tail, and tail has food, if head moves to tail cell to eat, then after eating, head is at tail position, tail is still there, but since we add a new segment at tail, the old tail becomes a body segment, and the new segment is added at the old tail position, so now head and the new segment (which is the new tail?) no.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Before move: head at H, tail at T, and food at T.\n> \n> - Head moves to T to eat food.\n> \n> - After move: head is now at T, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which is T, so now there are two segments at T: the head and the new segment. This is a collision, so the snake dies.\n> \n> Therefore, it's invalid to eat food on the tail cell.\n> \n> Similarly, if food is on a body cell, we can only eat it after the body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,4), after turn 81 move, at turn 82, it is the tail, so we cannot eat it directly because it's on tail.\n> \n> Moreover, head is not adjacent, so no danger, but we can't eat it yet.\n> \n> We need to move so that the tail moves away, freeing (3,4), and then head can move to it later.\n> \n> But there is food there, so once freed, it might be eaten if head goes there.\n> \n> But also, the food is on the cell, so when the snake moves and the tail leaves, the cell is free with food, then head can move to it.\n> \n> At turn 82, after move, (3,4) is tail with food.\n> \n> If we move the snake, the tail will move away from (3,4) to the position of the previous segment, and (3,4) becomes free with food, unless we eat it immediately.\n> \n> But head is far.\n> \n> So, for example, at turn 82, we move from (6,4).\n> \n> Say we move U to (6,5).\n> \n> Then as above, new tail is at (3,4), but after the move, the old tail at (3,4) is gone, and new tail is at (3,4)?

So the snake is 15 units long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,4) with life span 7, value 1 (positive) – but (3,4) is occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions include (3,4) as the 14th segment. Let me check: positions are head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). So (3,4) is the 14th segment, meaning it's part of the body. But food at (3,4) can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive).\n> \n> Current head direction is Up, so from (6,4), moving Up would go to (6,5), but I need to check if that's valid.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): Up to (6,5), Down to (6,3), Left to (5,4), Right to (7,4).\n> \n> But Right to (7,4) might be a wall? x=7 is border, so (7,4) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down. So cannot move Down to (6,3) on the next turn? No, the rule is \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since we're deciding for turn 82, the current direction is from previous move, which is Up, so we cannot choose Down for turn 82.\n> \n> Action sequence starts from turn 82.\n> \n> Current head direction is given as U, meaning the snake is facing Up, so for turn 82, we can choose any direction except the opposite, which is Down. So cannot move Down.\n> \n> Available moves: Up, Left, Right. But Right to (7,4) is wall, so invalid. Left to (5,4), Up to (6,5).\n> \n> (5,4) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,4) head, (6,3) next, etc. (5,4) is not in the list, so should be free, but let's confirm.\n> \n> List all snake positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). So (5,4) is not listed, so it's empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) should be empty.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders and obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (2,1) and (2,3) are obstacles, but (5,6) is an obstacle.\n> \n> (6,5): is it wall? y=5, x=6, not border or obstacle? Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,5) is within, and no internal obstacle there, so should be free.\n> \n> (5,4): similarly, free.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,5) at (2,5), life span 2, so it will disappear after 2 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 82, life span 2, after turn 82 it becomes 1, after turn 83 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it must be eaten by turn 83.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) at (3,4), life span 7, so it has more time.\n> \n> (5,5) at (5,5), life span 10.\n> \n> But (3,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, it's the 14th segment.

At turn 82, it has life span 2, so after turn 82, it will have life span 1, and after turn 83, it disappears. So to eat it, the head must be at (2,5) on turn 83 or earlier. But turn 82 is current, so on turn 82 or 83.\n> \n> On turn 82, head is at (6,4), so to reach (2,5) in one move? Not possible, since (2,5) is 4 units away in x and 1 in y, so at least 4 moves away? Manhattan distance.\n> \n> From (6,4) to (2,5): Δx=4, Δy=1, so min 5 moves?

(6,5) to (5,5), then (4,5), but (3,5) might be free? (3,5) not listed as obstacle, but let's see path.\n> \n> Similarly, from (5,4) to (2,5).\n> \n> But after turn 82, life span decreases to 1, so it must be eaten on turn 83.\n> \n> So head must be at (2,5) on turn 83.\n> \n> Currently turn 82, head at (6,4).

That's 4 moves, but we need to reach by turn 83, which is one move from the position after turn 82.\n> \n> After turn 82, head at new position, say P.\n> \n> Then on turn 83, move from P to (2,5) only if adjacent.\n> \n> (2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (2,4)\n> \n> (1,5): x=1,y=5, not border?

Border walls: x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so not border. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) not listed, so should be free.

If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because after eating, snake grows, so the new tail is where the old tail was, but head moves there, so it collides with the new tail? Let me read.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, head is at (6,5), tail at (3,4).

(6,5) to (3,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal or farther.\n> \n> So head not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> But the food at (3,4) can be eaten only if tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, for turn 83, I need to choose action: U or L.\n> \n> If I go L to (5,5), that's the food position, so I can eat it immediately.\n> \n> (5,5) has food with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> If I eat it, snake grows, so length increases by 1, and the food is consumed.\n> \n> Then snake positions: new head at (5,5), and body extends, so the tail doesn't move yet? When snake eats, it grows, so on the next move, when head moves to new cell, the tail stays or moves depending on growth.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so length increases, and the tail doesn't move that turn. So the new position has head at food cell, and the previous body segments, tail remains.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the head is at the food cell, and the body includes all previous segments, so tail is still there, but since it grew, the tail doesn't advance until the next move without eating.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,5), which has food, I eat it, so snake grows to 16 segments. Positions: head at (5,5), then the previous head (6,5) becomes second, then (6,4), and so on, up to tail (3,4). Tail remains (3,4) for this turn, since it didn't move.\n> \n> Then on next turn, when I move, the tail will move only if I don't eat food.\n> \n> But here, I eat, so tail stays.\n> \n> Now, if I go U to (6,6), no food there, so no eat, snake moves, head to (6,6), tail moves forward, so tail position changes.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn.

I must avoid these walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,4), and the direction is L (left). So the snake is moving left.

It's turn 87. The grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include borders and internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,5), and direction is Up.

That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Food: There are two food items:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1 and life span 3.

Let's calculate: from turn 87, after 8 turns it disappears, so on turn 95 it's gone? Life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if life span is 8 on turn 87, it will be there for turns 87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94, and gone on turn 95. But since we're on turn 87, it has 8 turns left including this one. So it lasts until turn 94 inclusive, I think. The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for life span L on turn T, it will be gone by turn T+L. For (3,4), life span 3 on turn 87, so after 3 turns: turn 87,88,89, gone on turn 90. Similarly, (1,6) life span 8, gone on turn 87+8=95.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,5) facing Up. From Up, possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since it's facing Up, reverse is Down, so I cannot move Down immediately. So valid moves from (4,5) are U, L, R. Down is invalid because it would be reverse.\n> \n> Current position: (4,5). Moving Up would go to (4,6). Moving Left to (3,5), Right to (5,5). But (5,5) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), so (5,5) is the fourth segment, which is part of the body. So moving to (5,5) would cause a collision because head touches body segment, except for the tail.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, but other body segments are not.\n> \n> Let's list all snake positions: indices 0 to 15: 0:(4,5) head, 1:(4,4), 2:(5,4), 3:(5,5), 4:(6,5), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,3), 7:(5,3), 8:(5,2), 9:(6,2), 10:(6,1), 11:(5,1), 12:(4,1), 13:(3,1), 14:(3,2), 15:(4,2) tail.\n> \n> After any move, the tail will move, but only if no food is eaten. If food is eaten, tail doesn't move, and snake grows.\n> \n> But for collision check, when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's deadly.

No: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so internal cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? But y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

So if head moves to (5,5), it would collide with body segment there, since that segment will not move away immediately; only tail moves away when snake moves forward without eating.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment other than tail, it dies immediately, because collision.\n> \n> If it moves to tail, and tail moves, it's ok.\n> \n> Here, (5,5) is occupied by segment 3, which is body, not tail, so moving right to (5,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, right is invalid.\n> \n> Also, Down: to (4,4). But (4,4) is occupied by snake segment 1, which is body, not tail. So moving down to (4,4) would cause collision.

After moving Up, direction is U, so cannot move Down next.\n> \n> (4,6) to north: (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot move Up. y=7 is wall, so from (4,6), moving Up to (4,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6): since direction now U, but Up is invalid, so can move Left, Right, or Down? Down is reverse, so cannot move Down because current direction is U.\n> \n> After moving, the head direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> So after moving Up to (4,6), head direction is U.\n> \n> Then next turn, from (4,6), direction U.\n> \n> Moves: Up to (4,7) - invalid, wall.\n> \n> Down to (4,5) - reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Left to (3,6) - (3,6) is an obstacle, so collision.\n> \n> Right to (5,6) - (5,6) is an obstacle, so collision.\n> \n> (3,6) and (5,6) are internal obstacles, so moving there causes collision.\n> \n> So from (4,6), with direction U, possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (4,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: reverse, not allowed\n> \n> - Left: to (3,6) obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - Right: to (5,6) obstacle, invalid\n> \n> Therefore, if I move to (4,6), I am trapped and die on the next turn because no valid moves! That's terrible.\n> \n> So moving Up to (4,6) is suicide.

Specifically, the last segment (4,2) is removed, and new positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), ..., up to (3,2) or something. Let's not list all unless needed.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction L, cannot move Right (reverse).\n> \n> So can move Up, Down, Left.\n> \n> - Left to (2,5): is (2,5) valid? x=2,y=5.

First, (3,4) is not occupied by body? After moving to (3,5), the body includes (4,5), (4,4), etc. (3,4) is not in the current body positions before move, but after moving to (3,5), the positions are: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) and tail was (4,2), but since no food eaten, tail moves away, so new tail is (3,2)?

It's turn 88. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those coordinates are walls, so the snake can be from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6. Also, there are internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body follows: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). That's 16 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it's moving left from (3,5) to, wait no, at turn 88, head is at (3,5) and direction is L, so it just moved left to (3,5)? Let's see the positions: snake positions are listed as [(3,5), (4,5), ...]. Since head is first, and it was moving left, that means it came from (4,5) to (3,5) on the previous move. Direction is given as current head direction, which is L, so for the next move, it can go U, D, L, R, but not reverse, which would be R (since L is left, reverse is right).\n> \n> No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so cannot move R on the next turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 88, life span 2, so it will be gone after turn 89? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it lasts until turn t + L - 1? For example, if at turn t, life span N, then on turn t, it's there, countdown to N-1; on turn t+1, if N-1 >0, it's there, countdown to N-2, and so on, until countdown 0, then disappears after that turn. The food is present as long as life span >0. So for (3,4), at turn 88, life span 2, so it will be present on turn 88 and 89, and disappear after turn 89 (so gone on turn 90).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) value 1, life span 7, so present for 7 turns including current, so until turn 94.\n> \n> (5,1) value 1, life span 10, present until turn 97.\n> \n> All food has value +1, no negative food mentioned in this state.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but probably more since the sequence should cover multiple turns, and I have to think 5+ turns ahead for strategy.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So blocked cells: (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6).\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, but since playable area is 1-6, x=0 and x=7 are out of bounds, similarly y=0 and y=7. So cells like (0,y) or (x,0) are invalid.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).

Snake has (5,1) as the 13th segment. But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake body. So to eat it, the snake needs to move so that (5,1) is vacated, then later head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (3,4) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), etc. (3,4) is not in the list, so it's free.\n> \n> (1,6) is free, not occupied.\n> \n> (5,1) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), direction L (left).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): but reverse is not allowed, since current direction is L, moving right would be opposite, so cannot.\n> \n> Cannot move right.\n> \n> Now, check what cells are available:\n> \n> - (3,6): is it blocked? Internal obstacles include (3,6), which is blocked. So cannot move there.\n> \n> - (3,4): down, is it free? (3,4) is food, and not occupied by snake, so yes, can move there.\n> \n> - (2,5): left, what is there? x=2,y=5. Is it wall? x=2, between 1 and 6, y=5 between 1 and 6. Obstacles: (2,1), (2,3), but not (2,5), so should be free. Snake positions: head at (3,5), body at (4,5), (4,4), etc. (2,5) not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n> \n> If I move D to (3,4), that would eat the food since (3,4) has positive food.

Tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Head at (3,5), so not adjacent.

When snake eats, on the next move, when head moves, a new segment is added, but tail doesn't move, so snake gets longer.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Then next turn, when head moves, tail moves, etc.\n> \n> In terms of positions: if head moves to food cell, it consumes the food, and the snake grows, meaning that the new position is added, but the tail remains in place for that turn. Then on subsequent moves, tail moves.\n> \n> But for collision, body includes all segments except the head, I think.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid map.\n> \n> I should sketch the grid.\n> \n> Let me make a 6x6 grid, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> - (1,3)\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> Also, borders are walls, but since we're only in 1-6, we don't consider x=0,7 etc.\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> (3,2) is tail.\n> \n> Food: (3,4), (1,6), (5,1)\n> \n> But (5,1) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Now, at turn 88, head at (3,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (3,4) or L to (2,5)\n> \n> If I move D to (3,4), I eat the food. Then snake grows: new head at (3,4), body adds, so positions become: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), etc., and tail at (3,2) still? When head moves to (3,4) and eats, the segment at (3,5) becomes part of body, and since it ate, tail doesn't move, so the snake now has 17 segments: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2).\n> \n> Tail is still (3,2).\n> \n> Now, after this move, at turn 89, head at (3,4), direction would be D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Current direction after move: I moved D, so new direction is D.\n> \n> Then possible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body, so collision if move there.\n> \n> D to (3,3), what is (3,3)?

Let's clarify the tail movement.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - When snake moves and does not eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves off last cell.\n> \n> - When snake eats, head moves to food cell, consumes food, tail does not move, so snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Turn 88: head moves to (3,4) and eats food. So new positions: head at (3,4), body: previous head (3,5) becomes segment, and all body, tail at (3,2) remains. So snake now 17 segments.\n> \n> Turn 89: head moves from (3,4) to, say, (3,3). Since no food at (3,3), so head moves to (3,3), tail moves off (3,2), so new tail is the previous segment, which was (3,1) or something. Positions: before move turn 89, head (3,4), segments: (3,5), (4,5), ..., down to (3,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,3): head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), ..., up to (4,1), (3,1), and tail (3,2) is removed. So tail now is (3,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if I had not eaten, tail would move each turn.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> So at turn 88, moving down to (3,4) seems necessary to get the food, as it will disappear soon.\n> \n> Then, at turn 89, from (3,4), direction D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision.\n> \n> D to (3,3) - free.\n> \n> L to (2,4) - free.\n> \n> R to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, collision.\n> \n> Cannot move up since opposite?

Walls are at:\n> \n> - All cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 (borders)\n> \n> - Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,4), and the body segments follow: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> Head direction is Down (D), meaning it's moving downwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Life span: For (1,6), it disappears after 6 turns, including this one, so it will be gone after turn 89 + 6 - 1 = turn 94? Let's calculate life span.\n> \n> Life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn including current. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the start of turn t + L.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 6 at turn 89, so it will be present on turns 89,90,91,92,93, and disappear at turn 94.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): life span 9, present from turn 89 to 97, disappear at turn 98.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,4) moving down. Down means increasing y, so from (3,4) down would be to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), etc. So the head is at (3,4), and moving down to (3,5) would be into the body, which is deadly unless it's the tail and we're eating or something. But in this case, (3,5) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> List of positions: indices 0 to 16, I think? Count: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). That's 17 segments.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction down. But (3,5) is directly below, which is occupied by the body. Moving down would cause a collision immediately. That can't be right.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread the positions. Snake positions are listed from head to tail: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n> \n> So head at (3,4), next segment at (3,5), which is directly below. Since head is moving down, it must have just moved to (3,4) from above, but above is (3,3)? But (3,3) is not in the list. Let's see the positions: from (3,4) to (3,5) is down, but (3,5) is the second segment, so if head moves down to (3,5), it would collide.\n> \n> But head direction is given as D, down. So on the next move, if it moves down, it would go to (3,5), which is occupied, so it would die.\n> \n> That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the head direction is the direction it was moving when it arrived at the current position. So from previous position to current.\n> \n> Current head position is (3,4), and it came from (3,3), I assume, but (3,3) is not in the positions. Positions start from (3,4) as head.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions include the current state, with head at (3,4), and it was moving down to get there, so previous position was (3,3), but (3,3) is not listed because it's not part of the snake anymore? No, the snake positions are all segments, so if it was at (3,3) before, it should be in the list if it's part of the body.\n> \n> Let's list all positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,4) head\n> \n> Index 1: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 3: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 4: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 5: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 6: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 7: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 8: (6,3)\n> \n> Index 9: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 10: (5,2)\n> \n> Index 11: (6,2)\n> \n> Index 12: (6,1)\n> \n> Index 13: (5,1)\n> \n> Index 14: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 15: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 16: (3,2) tail\n> \n> The head is at (3,4), and the next segment is at (3,5), which is directly below. Since the head direction is down, it means that in the previous move, it moved down to (3,4) from (3,3), but (3,3) is not in the positions, so it must have been the previous position that is not part of the snake anymore, or perhaps it's an error.\n> \n> If the snake was at (3,3) at turn 88, and moved down to (3,4) at turn 89, then the new head is at (3,4), and the tail might have moved, but in this case, the tail is at (3,2), so it didn't grow, so tail moved from previous position.\n> \n> At turn 89, positions are given, so head is at (3,4), which it just moved to, and it was moving down to get there, so from (3,3) to (3,4).\n> \n> But (3,3) is not occupied now, so it's fine. For the next move, from (3,4), possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Head direction is down, so it cannot instantly reverse to up; that would be illegal. So possible moves are D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> Now, from (3,4), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,3) - is this free? Let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is within bounds, x=3 between 1 and 6, y=3 between 1 and 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free? No, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 or x=7.\n> \n> But internal obstacles also.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> But since borders, it's the same as x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Plus internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So for (3,3): x=3, y=3, not on border, not in internal obstacles, so it should be free, but we need to check if snake is occupying it.\n> \n> Snake positions: from above, (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), etc., (3,3) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions from (3,4):\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) - occupied by snake body (index 1)\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) - x=2, y=4, not wall, not in obstacles? Internal obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), so (2,4) is not listed, so free? But need to check snake.\n> \n> Snake has (3,4), (3,5), etc., no (2,4), so free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) - occupied by snake body (index 3)\n> \n> Index 3 is (4,4), which is part of the body.\n> \n> So from (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,3) - seems free\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - occupied by body, deadly\n> \n> - L: (2,4) - free?\n> \n> - R: (4,4) - occupied by body, deadly\n> \n> Also, cannot move up because head direction is down, and moving up would be instant reverse? No, the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So moving up is not allowed; it would be invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: only left or right? Down is occupied, up is reverse not allowed, right is occupied, left might be free.\n> \n> But head direction is down, so moving left or right is perpendicular, so allowed. Moving up is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So from (3,4), with head dir down, possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (3,5) but occupied, collision\n> \n> - L: to (2,4)\n> \n> - R: to (4,4) but occupied, collision\n> \n> - U: not allowed, reverse\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (2,4)? Is (2,4) free?\n> \n> Check if (2,4) is wall or occupied.\n> \n> Walls: not border, not internal obstacle listed. Internal obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6). (2,4) is not among them.\n> \n> Snake positions: no (2,4), so yes, (2,4) is free.\n> \n> But is it safe? Moving to (2,4) might be ok, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> The snake has to move somewhere, and left is the only option? But down and right are blocked, up not allowed, so only left is possible without dying immediately.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> I should make a grid map.\n> \n> Create an 8x8 grid, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells are walls.\n> \n> Internal walls: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> So mark walls:\n> \n> - (0,0) to (0,7) wall\n> \n> - (7,0) to (7,7) wall\n> \n> - (0,0) to (7,0) wall? (x,0) for all x, so row y=0 all wall.\n> \n> Similarly y=7 all wall.\n> \n> Then internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> Tail: (3,2)\n> \n> Now food: (1,6) and (5,1)\n> \n> (5,1) is also occupied by snake? Snake has (5,1) at index 13, which is a body segment, not the head.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> But (5,1) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is free? Let's see, (1,6): x=1, y=6, not wall, not snake position? Snake positions have (3,4) to (3,2), etc., no (1,6), so it should be free.\n> \n> But it's food with positive value.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: from (3,4), head dir down, only possible safe move is to (2,4) by moving left.\n> \n> Moving down to (3,5) is body collision.\n> \n> Moving right to (4,4) is body collision (index 3).\n> \n> Moving up to (3,3) is not allowed due to reverse.\n> \n> So must move left to (2,4).\n> \n> But is (2,4) safe? For this turn, yes, but I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> The instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, food: (1,6) and (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is under snake body, so it can be eaten only if snake moves away and back.\n> \n> (1,6) is free, at (1,6).\n> \n> Life span: (1,6) disappears at turn 94 (since turn 89 + 6 -1? Life span 6 at turn 89, so present turns 89,90,91,92,93, gone at 94.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) present until turn 97, gone at 98.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), moving to (2,4) this turn.\n> \n> Then from there, I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> But first, let's confirm the move for turn 89.\n> \n> Action on turn 89: must be L (left) to (2,4).\n> \n> Then head direction will be left.\n> \n> Now, think ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Possible to go for food at (1,6) or (5,1).\n> \n> (1,6) is at (1,6), which is top-left, y=6 is near the top, since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is second row from top.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall, so y increases upwards? Typically in coordinates, y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, towards y=7.\n> \n> In the position, head at (3,4), moving down to (3,5) would be y+1? Let's see.\n> \n> Coordinate system: U (x,y+1) — that means increasing y is up.\n> \n> For example, from (3,4) U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n> \n> In this case, head at (3,4), if it moves down to (3,5), y increases? D is (x,y-1)? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Look at the core rules:\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> And walls at y=0 and y=7, with y=0 and y=7 being walls.\n> \n> Also, in positions, head at (3,4), and (3,5) is directly above if y increases up.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Assume standard: (0,0) bottom-left, (7,0) bottom-right, (0,7) top-left, (7,7) top-right.\n> \n> So U: (x,y+1) — up, towards higher y\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — down, towards lower y\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) — left, lower x\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) — right, higher x\n> \n> Head at (3,4), moving down to (3,3) would be D, but it was moving down to (3,4), so from (3,3) to (3,4) is U? I'm confused.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning it was moving down to reach (3,4), so it came from (3,3) to (3,4) by moving down? Movement: if moving down, from (x,y) to (x,y-1) for D.\n> \n> If head was at (3,3) and moved down to (3,2)? Let's think.\n> \n> If current position is (3,4), and head direction is D (down), that means it arrived at (3,4) by moving down, so from (3,5) to (3,4)? Because D is (x,y-1), so from (x,y) to (x,y-1) for down.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Movement: when you move in a direction, you go to the adjacent cell in that direction.\n> \n> So if you move U from (x,y), you go to (x,y+1)\n> \n> Move D to (x,y-1)\n> \n> Move L to (x-1,y)\n> \n> Move R to (x+1,y)\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it moved to reach the current position.\n> \n> So for current head at (3,4), head direction D means it moved down to get there, so it came from (3,5) to (3,4) by moving down (D).\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense with the positions: the next segment is (3,5), which is above it, so it came from (3,5) to (3,4) by moving down.\n> \n> So current head (3,4), direction D, so it cannot move up (U) next, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - D: to (3,3) — y-1, so (3,3)\n> \n> - L: to (2,4)\n> \n> - R: to (4,4)\n> \n> - U: not allowed, reverse\n> \n> Now, (3,3): is it free? Not wall, not snake. Snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), etc., no (3,3), so free.\n> \n> (2,4): free, as before.\n> \n> (4,4): occupied by snake body, index 3, (4,4), so collision if move there.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (3,3) or L to (2,4)\n> \n> Both are possible.\n> \n> I missed the down move earlier.\n> \n> So from (3,4), with head dir D, can move D to (3,3) or L to (2,4), or R to (4,4) but occupied, so not possible.

Tail is at (3,2), but when snake moves, tail moves, so it might be ok if we eat or not.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,2). If we move to (3,3), we don't eat, so snake moves, head to (3,3), tail moves from (3,2) to the previous position, but in this case, since no food, length same, so tail moves away.\n> \n> After move, head to new position, and tail removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> So if move to (3,3), no food there, so snake: new head at (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), ..., up to (3,2) is tail, but tail moves to where? The segment before tail was (3,1), I think.\n> \n> Positions after move: head moves to (3,3), then the body segments: the first body segment was (3,5), but since head moved to (3,3), the new body starts from previous head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), etc., up to the tail (3,2). But since no food, tail is removed, so the new tail is the second last segment.\n> \n> Current positions: 17 segments.\n> \n> After moving to (3,3) without eating, new positions: head at (3,3), then body: [ (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ] and tail was (3,2) but removed, so new tail is (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is now the last, which is index 15 in original, but after move, positions are head (3,3) and segments 0 to 15 except head is new, so body: (3,4) as index 1, (3,5) index 2, ..., up to (3,1) as index 15, and (3,2) gone. So 16 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if move to (2,4).\n> \n> But back to decision.\n> \n> At (3,3), from there, can move D to (3,2), but (3,2) is not occupied now, since tail moved?

the inevitable risk of getting trapped in the top-left corner after eating due to wall and body constraints. Moving left immediately avoids the body collision at (3,5) and positions the snake to reach the food efficiently, but long-term survival is compromised by the limited escape routes after consumption.\n",

Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,4), and direction is L, which is left.

Walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. (1,6) should be playable, but let's check obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).

So (5,1) is position 14, which is not the tail; tail is (3,1).\n> \n> Since food is under the body at (5,1), it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,6), it's free, I think.\n> \n> Life span: food at (1,6) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn. So if not eaten by turn 95, it's gone. Turn 90 now, so it will disappear after turn 90+5=95? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 90, life span is 5, after turn 90 it becomes 4, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it exists for turns 90,91,92,93,94; gone at turn 95.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,1) life span 8, so exists until turn 97.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,4), direction L (left).

Border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (1,4) should be within playable area since x=1 is not wall, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6).

Left would be to (0,4), but x=0 is wall, so cannot. Down to (1,3), but (1,3) is obstacle. Up to (1,5).\n> \n> So from (1,4), only possible move is up to (1,5), since left and down blocked.\n> \n> Then from (1,5), I can go up to (1,6) to eat food, or right to (2,5), or down to (1,4) but that's previous, now body.\n> \n> (1,6) is food, so if I go to (1,6), I eat it.\n> \n> But life span: if I go directly, I can reach (1,6) in two moves: turn 90: L to (1,4), turn 91: U to (1,5), turn 92: U to (1,6) to eat.\n> \n> At turn 90 move to (1,4), turn 91 to (1,5), turn 92 to (1,6).\n> \n> Life span of (1,6) is 5 at turn 90, so after turn 90, it becomes 4, then 3,2,1,0. After turn 90, countdown decreases, so at start of turn 90, life span 5, after the turn, it decreases to 4. So it can be eaten on turns 90,91,92,93,94.\n> \n> On turn 92, it is still there, life span 3? Let's clarify.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it means it will disappear after L more turns, including the current turn.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn t, life span is L. After the turn, it decreases by 1.\n> \n> The food can be eaten during turn t if head moves onto it.\n> \n> If life span is L at start of turn, after eating or not, at end of turn, life span becomes L-1.\n> \n> If L=1 at start, after turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for (1,6) at turn 90, life span=5, so it can be eaten on turn 90,91,92,93,94. On turn 95, it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life span 8, can be eaten turn 90 to 97.\n> \n> In my plan, if I go to (1,6) on turn 92, it should be fine.\n> \n> But when I eat food, snake grows, so length increases.\n> \n> Now, if I go up from (2,4) to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (1,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is free, (1,5) free.\n> \n> Then to (1,6) from (1,5) or (2,6).\n> \n> From (2,5), to (1,5), then to (1,6).\n> \n> Or to (2,6), then to (1,6) or (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, so only to (1,6) or down to (2,5) but not possible.\n> \n> From (2,6), can go to (1,6), (2,5) but (2,5) now body, or (3,6) obstacle, so only to (1,6).\n> \n> Similarly.\n> \n> But going via (2,5) might take an extra turn.\n> \n> From (2,4) to (2,5) on turn 90, then turn 91 to (2,6) or (1,5), say to (1,5), then turn 92 to (1,6). Same as before.\n> \n> Or to (2,6) on turn 91, then turn 92 to (1,6).\n> \n> So minimum two moves to reach (1,6) from (2,4), but with different paths.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (5,1) is under the body. To eat it, I need to have the head move to (5,1) after the body has moved away.\n> \n> Currently, (5,1) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position, so (5,1) becomes free if no other part is there, but since it's a body segment, when it moves, the cell is vacated.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to (5,1) on the same turn or later, it can eat the food, provided the food is still there.\n> \n> But the food life span decreases.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 90, (5,1) has life span 8.\n> \n> The segment at (5,1) is position 14 in the list. When the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After moving, the tail moves forward, so the cell (5,1) will be vacated when that segment moves.\n> \n> Let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> At turn 90, before move, head at (2,4), tail at (3,1).\n> \n> After moving, say to a new position, the head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts to the position of the next segment towards head, and tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> But when no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, if not food, then tail is removed, so snake shortens? No, when no food eaten, the tail cell is vacated, but the snake doesn't grow, so length same.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to empty cell, tail moves, so the cell that was tail is now empty.\n> \n> When head moves to food, tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,1), it is not the tail; tail is (3,1).\n> \n> When snake moves, the segment that was at (5,1) will move to where the previous segment was. Let's trace.\n> \n> The body segments: let's index from head: 0: (2,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,4), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,2), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (3,1) tail.\n> \n> When head moves to a new position, say to cell X, then segment 0 is now at X.\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, (2,4).\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (3,4).\n> \n> And so on, down to segment 16, the tail, moves to where segment 15 was, (4,1), and the previous tail cell (3,1) is vacated.\n> \n> For cell (5,1), it is occupied by segment 14. After move, segment 14 will move to where segment 13 was, which is (6,1).\n> \n> So (5,1) is vacated after the move, because segment 14 moves to (6,1), and no segment is at (5,1) anymore, unless head or something moves there.\n> \n> After the move, the cell (5,1) is empty and has food, since food is there.\n> \n> So on the next turn, (5,1) is free with food.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to (5,1), it can eat the food.\n> \n> But head is at (2,4), far away.\n> \n> To reach (5,1) from (2,4), it's several moves.\n> \n> Distance: delta x=3, delta y= -3, so at least 6 moves with turns, but with obstacles, it might be longer.\n> \n> Moreover, the food at (5,1) has life span 8, so it can be eaten until turn 97.\n> \n> But I need to survive and think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,1), and food at (5,1), not on tail, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate choice: at turn 90, from (2,4), move U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n> \n> If I move L to (1,4), then as I said, from (1,4), only move is U to (1,5), then to (1,6) to eat on turn 92.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,5), then I can go to (1,5) or (2,6), then to (1,6).\n> \n> But (2,6) is free, I can go there.\n> \n> But to eat (1,6), it's similar.\n> \n> But after eating (1,6), snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n> \n> Then the tail doesn't move, so the body stays longer.\n> \n> Now, what about the other food at (5,1)? It might be eaten later, but I need to see if it's worth it.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid dead ends or traps.\n> \n> Now, let's look at the snake body. The snake is long, 17 segments, and the grid has obstacles, so space is limited.\n> \n> Playable cells: grid 6x6 has 36 cells, obstacles: 5 internal, so 31 free cells, but snake occupies 17, so only 14 free cells? 36 - 5 obstacles = 31, snake 17, so 14 free, but when snake moves, cells change.\n> \n> At any time, number of free cells is total cells minus obstacles minus snake occupied.\n> \n> Total cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, 36 cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: 5, so 31 accessible cells when no snake.\n> \n> Snake occupies 17, so 31 - 17 = 14 free cells.\n> \n> But as snake moves, free cells change.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) and (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied, so not free yet.\n> \n> After turn 90, when snake moves, (5,1) might be vacated.\n> \n> Let's simulate turn 90.\n> \n> First, I need to decide the move.\n> \n> I should consider the risks.\n> \n> If I go to (1,4) or (2,5).\n> \n> If I go to (1,4), then I am forced to go up to (1,5), then to (1,6). So I will eat the food on turn 92.\n> \n> Then snake grows to 18 segments.\n> \n> After eating at (1,6), head is at (1,6), and body includes the new segment.\n> \n> From (1,6), possible moves: down to (1,5), but (1,5) is body after move, or right to (2,6), or up? y=6, up to y=7 is wall, so cannot. Left to (0,6) wall, cannot. So only right to (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is free, I think.\n> \n> So after eating at (1,6), head at (1,6), then must move to (2,6) on next turn.\n> \n> Then from (2,6), I can go to (2,5), or (3,6), but (3,6) obstacle, or (1,6) body, or down to (2,5)?

Head is at (1,4), moving left, so previous position was to the right, which is (2,4), yes.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (1,4) head, index 1: (2,4), index 2: (3,4), index 3: (3,5), index 4: (4,5), index 5: (4,4), index 6: (5,4), index 7: (5,5), index 8: (6,5), index 9: (6,4), index 10: (6,3), index 11: (5,3), index 12: (5,2), index 13: (6,2), index 14: (6,1), index 15: (5,1), index 16: (4,1) tail.\n> \n> Since direction is L, and head at (1,4), it was at (2,4) before, moving left to (1,4).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span), Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,6), life span 4 at turn 91. That means it will disappear after turn 91 + 3? Let's see: at turn 91, life span 4, so after this turn, it decreases to 3, then to 2 at turn 92, to 1 at turn 93, and gone at turn 94. So it can be eaten on turns 91,92,93,94? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it exists for N turns, including the current one.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, life span becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn 91, food has life span 4. After the turn, it decreases to 3, and so on. So it can be eaten on any turn when life span >0.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 4 at turn 91, so can be eaten on turns 91,92,93,94? After turn 91, life span 3; after turn 92, life span 2; after turn 93, life span 1; after turn 94, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 91,92,93,94? Turn 94: if eaten on turn 94, when life span is 1 before the turn, after eating, it decreases to 0, but since it's eaten, it's gone.\n> \n> But for planning, we care about when it exists.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life span 7 at turn 91, so exists until turn 97? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 91: life span 7\n> \n> - After turn 91: life span 6\n> \n> - After turn 92: 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 97: life span 0, disappears. So can be eaten from turn 91 to 97.\n> \n> Turn 97: if eaten on turn 97, life span before turn is 1? Let's see the count.\n> \n> At turn t, before action, life span is L.\n> \n> After turn, it decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for eating, it can be eaten as long as life span >0 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> For (1,6): at turn 91, L=4, can be eaten turn 91.\n> \n> Turn 92: L=3 (after decrease from turn 91), can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 93: L=2, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 94: L=1, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 95: L=0, disappeared, cannot be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): L=7 at turn 91, can be eaten turn 91 to 97.\n> \n> Turn 97: L=1 at start, can be eaten.\n> \n> (4,3): L=10, can be eaten turn 91 to 100.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,4), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite, which would be right, but current direction left, so opposite is right, not allowed).\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 92, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let me clarify the life span.\n> \n> The description says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (1,6) with life span 3 on turn 92, it will disappear at the end of turn 95, I think. Because on turn 92, countdown is 3; after turn 92, it becomes 2; after turn 93, it becomes 1; after turn 94, it becomes 0, and it disappears before turn 95 or after? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L turns starting from t. So on turn t, countdown L; after turn t, L-1; ... after turn t+L-1, countdown 1; after turn t+L, countdown 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 3 at turn 92, so it can be eaten on turns 92, 93, 94. After turn 94, it disappears before turn 95.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) with value 1 and life span 6: can be eaten from turn 92 to 97.\n> \n> (4,3) with value 1 and life span 9: can be eaten from turn 92 to 100.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food.

Snake head is at (1,5), so (1,6) is directly above head.\n> \n> - (5,1) is at (5,1), and snake positions include (5,1), which is the tail. Tail is at (5,1), and food is at (5,1), so this food is under the tail segment.\n> \n> - (4,3) is at (4,3), which is not under snake body?

Similarly, (1,6) is not occupied. (5,1) is occupied by the tail.\n> \n> For (5,1), since it's under the tail, I can eat it only if the tail moves away and then head moves onto it. But the tail is at (5,1), and when the snake moves, the tail will move only if the snake doesn't eat food. If I eat food, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> But for food under the body, I can eat it only when the body part moves away, freeing the cell, and then head moves in.\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) is the tail. If I move such that the tail moves away, then on the next turn, (5,1) is free, and I can move head there to eat it, but only if head can reach it.\n> \n> But there's a Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food at (5,1) is on the tail. Tail is at (5,1). Head is at (1,5), which is not adjacent to (5,1). Adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (1,5) to (5,1) is not adjacent; it's far away.\n> \n> So no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> First, I need to decide where to move on turn 92.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,5), direction U (up, so y+1).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is U, so opposite is D (down). So I cannot move down on next turn. So possible moves: U, L, R.

Snake positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), etc. (2,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (2,5) not in obstacles, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): is it free? (1,6) has food, and not occupied by snake or wall. Snake is at (1,5) and (1,4), but not (1,6).

No other moves are valid.\n- **At Turn 94**: Only possible move is L to (1,6). No other moves are valid.\n  \nThus, the sequence leading to the snake's death is unavoidable given the current state.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nGiven the analysis, the only possible actions are:\n\n- **Turn 93**: Move U to (2,6).\n- **Turn 94**: Move L to (1,6).\n\nAfter these moves, the snake has no valid moves left and will die on Turn 95.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U} (for Turn 93)",

It's turn 93, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,5), and it's moving right (R). The body segments follow: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1). Let me list all positions in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (2,5)\n> \n> 2. (1,5)\n> \n> 3. (1,4)\n> \n> 4. (2,4)\n> \n> 5. (3,4)\n> \n> 6. (3,5)\n> \n> 7. (4,5)\n> \n> 8. (4,4)\n> \n> 9. (5,4)\n> \n> 10. (5,5)\n> \n> 11. (6,5)\n> \n> 12.

Head direction is right, so from (2,5), moving right would go to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by the body segment at position 6. That can't be right because moving right from (2,5) to (3,5) would cause a collision if the body is there.\n> \n> Current head position is (2,5), direction R, so next move if I go right would be to (3,5). But (3,5) is the 6th segment in the list. Since the snake moves, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves off, so positions shift. But at the start of turn, before moving, all cells are occupied except the tail might move.\n> \n> I need to think about the state before any move. At turn 93, the snake occupies all these cells. If I move the head to (3,5), which is currently occupied by the body, but since the tail will move, it might be okay if (3,5) is not the immediate next segment.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), tail (6,1).\n> \n> From head (2,5), the adjacent body segment is (1,5), which is left, not right. Right of (2,5) is (3,5), which is occupied but it's a few segments away. In snake, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail moving, it's okay, but only if it's the tail cell specifically.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that is the current tail position is safe because the tail moves off. But moving to any other body segment cell causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is not the tail; tail is (6,1). So if I move right to (3,5), it's occupied by the 6th segment, which is not tail, so it would be a collision. But let's confirm the positions.\n> \n> (3,5) is listed as position 6: (3,5). And head is at (2,5), moving right to (3,5) would collide with body segment there.\n> \n> But that doesn't make sense because if the snake is moving, the body should be connected. Let's plot this.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7).

That's inconsistent.\n> \n> Head direction is the current moving direction, which is R, meaning it was moving right to reach (2,5)? No.\n> \n> The head direction is the direction the head is facing for the next move. Let's read the input.\n> \n> \"Snake Head Direction: R\" and it's at position (2,5). So for the next move, it can go in direction R, which is (x+1,y), so to (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) is occupied by the body at position 6. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause a collision.\n> \n> But that can't be right for the game state; probably I misread the positions.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, so at turn 93, the snake is on these cells, and head is at (2,5), and it was moving right to get there? Let's think about the previous move.\n> \n> The head direction is the direction it is currently moving, so for the current turn, it can move in that direction or change, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> \"Snake Head Direction: R\" means the head is facing right, so it can move right, or up or down, but not left, since left is opposite to right.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L (left) on this turn because it's instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4), R to (3,5), L to (1,5). But L is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L. Also, (1,5) is occupied by body, so moving L would collide, but even if not, it's not allowed due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, check what cells are occupied or walls.\n> \n> First, U to (2,6): y=6, x=2. Walls: borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is at (3,6), not (2,6). (2,6) is free? Let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,5) head, then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), etc. No (2,6), so (2,6) is empty.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (2,6) is not an obstacle.\n> \n> So U to (2,6) is possible? But (2,6) is y=6, and walls are at y=7, so y=6 is within bounds.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) to (7,7), walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (2,6) are valid unless occupied or obstacle.\n> \n> (2,6) not in snake positions, not in obstacles, so free.\n> \n> D to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied by body segment at position 4. Not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> R to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied by body segment at position 6. Not tail, collision.\n> \n> So from (2,5), moving U to (2,6) is the only possible move? Because D and R are both occupied by body, and L is not allowed.\n> \n> But let's confirm the positions.\n> \n> Position 4 is (2,4), which is directly below (2,5), so if I move D to (2,4), it's the next segment, definitely collision.\n> \n> Similarly, position 6 is (3,5), which is right of (2,5), so moving R to (3,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> U to (2,6) is empty, as per above.\n> \n> But is there any other move? What about down? D to (2,4) is occupied. Left is not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (2,6)? But that seems forced, but let's see the food and other things.\n> \n> First, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All positive food, since value 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 93, life span 2, so it will disappear at the end of turn 94? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1? Or at turn t it has L turns left, including turn t.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, with life_span N, it has N turns left, including the current turn. So after N turns, it is gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn 93, food at (1,6) has life_span 2, so it will be there for turn 93 and 94, and disappear after turn 94, so not available on turn 95.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life_span 5, so available from turn 93 to 97, gone after 97.\n> \n> (4,3) life_span 8, available from 93 to 100, gone after 100.\n> \n> Now, back to moves. From (2,5), current direction R, possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> But D to (2,4) is occupied by snake body at (2,4), position 4.\n> \n> R to (3,5) is occupied by snake body at (3,5), position 6.\n> \n> U to (2,6) is empty, as per snake positions and obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6). (2,6) not among them.\n> \n> Walls: borders, (2,6) is x=2,y=6, not border.\n> \n> So U to (2,6) is the only possible move without collision? But is that right? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: all 17 cells occupied, so any cell not in that list and not wall/obstacle is free.\n> \n> Free cells: let's find empty cells in the grid.\n> \n> Grid size 8x8, 64 cells.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. But borders are lines, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n> \n> In terms of cells, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> So number of wall cells: top row y=7: 8 cells, bottom row y=0: 8 cells, but corners shared, so 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28? Left column x=0, y=1 to 6: 6 cells, right column x=7, y=1 to 6: 6 cells, top row x=0 to 7, y=7: 8 cells, bottom row x=0 to 7, y=0: 8 cells. But corner cells (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) are included in both row and column, so total walls: 2*8 + 2*6 - 4 = 16 + 12 - 4 = 24 cells? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> Cells with x=0: y from 0 to 7, 8 cells.\n> \n> x=7: y from 0 to 7, 8 cells.\n> \n> y=0: x from 1 to 6 (since x=0 and x=7 already counted), so 6 cells.\n> \n> y=7: x from 1 to 6, 6 cells.\n> \n> Total wall cells: 8 (x=0) + 8 (x=7) + 6 (y=0 middle) + 6 (y=7 middle) = 28 cells.\n> \n> But y=0 at x=0 and x=7 are included in x=0 and x=7, so for y=0, we add x=1 to 6, similarly for y=7.\n> \n> So yes, 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 wall cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: 5 cells: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake: 17 cells.\n> \n> Total occupied: walls 28 + internal obstacles 5 + snake 17 = 50 cells.\n> \n> Grid 8x8=64 cells, so free cells: 64 - 50 = 14 cells.\n> \n> But we don't need all, just around head.\n> \n> From (2,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (2,6) - y+1\n> \n> - Down: (2,4) - y-1\n> \n> - Left: (1,5) - x-1\n> \n> - Right: (3,5) - x+1\n> \n> (2,4) is occupied by snake (position 4)\n> \n> (1,5) is occupied by snake (position 2)\n> \n> (3,5) is occupied by snake (position 6)\n> \n> (2,6) is not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle, so it is free.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move from (2,5) is U to (2,6), since D and R are occupied, and L is not allowed due to no instant reverse (current direction R, opposite L not allowed).\n> \n> So for turn 93, I must move U to (2,6).\n> \n> But the action sequence should be for multiple turns, and I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Perhaps I have no choice for this turn.\n> \n> But let's confirm the head direction. Current head direction is R, and I'm moving U, which is not reverse, so it's allowed.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (2,6), the snake will grow only if it eats food, but (2,6) has food? Food positions: (1,6), (5,1), (4,3). (2,6) is not a food position, so no food eaten, so length unchanged, tail moves off.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,1), so after move, head moves to (2,6), body shifts, tail at (6,1) moves off, so new tail is the previous segment, (6,2)? Positions: after move, head is at (2,6), then the old head (2,5) becomes new position 2, then (1,5) position 3, (1,4) position 4, and so on, down to (6,1) is removed, so new tail is (6,2), which was position 16.\n> \n> But we need to think about future turns.\n> \n> First, for turn 93, action must be U, since no other choice.\n> \n> Then, on turn 94, snake head is at (2,6), and the direction was U (since I moved up), so current direction is U.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,6): U to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so collision, cannot move there.\n> \n> D to (2,5) - now (2,5) is occupied?

The current turn is 94. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), and (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,6), then body segments: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2). So the tail is at (6,2). Snake length is 17 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> But (6,4) is also a part of the snake's body. The snake positions include (6,4), which is the 13th segment. Since food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Here, (6,4) has food with life span 10, so it might be possible to eat it later if the snake moves such that this cell is vacated and then the head moves there.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead, to maximize score while avoiding risks.

Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so new head at (1,6), and tail doesn't move this turn? No, when you eat food, the snake grows, so the head moves to the food cell, and the tail stays where it is, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat food, head moves to food, new segment added, tail doesn't move that turn. So after eating, the tail remains, and next turn the tail moves if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,6), I eat the food. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn anyway, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone forever.\n> \n> But moving Left is the only possible move?

(1,6) not there, so it's safe to move to, and has food.\n> \n> But after moving to (1,6), what happens? Head is now at (1,6), and since I ate food, the snake grows, so the new position will be head at (1,6), and the body: the previous head was (2,6), which becomes body, then (2,5), (1,5), etc., and tail at (6,2) stays because growth.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (1,6), then (2,6) (which was head, now body), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), ..., up to (6,2), and since length increases, (6,2) is still tail, not moved.\n> \n> Now, direction: I moved Left from Up, so new head direction is L?
