The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe car update rules: \n  - For a car moving right: at time t, the car's span is [tau, h] (with tau <= h). At time T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)].\n  - For a car moving left: at time t, the car's span is [h, tau] (with h <= tau). At time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t), tau - s*(T-t)].\n\nBut note: the given car states are at turn t1=0.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only on freeway y_T at turn T. So at the moment of the move, we only check the freeway we are leaving (if we move) or staying (if we stay). Actually, note the rule: \n  - If at turn T we are at y_T, then we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nAlso, when we are at a freeway at turn T, we check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that exact turn T.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 0. We are on freeway 0? But note: the freeways that have cars are y=1 to 8. The player starts at y=0 and the goal is y=9. So we don't have to worry about cars at y=0 and y=9.\n\nThe problem: we must avoid collisions when we are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are at turn 0 at (0,0). We can take actions: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1, but we are at 0 so we cannot go below 0), S (stay).\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nWe are going to plan a sequence of moves. Since we want minimal turns, we would prefer to go up as much as possible. However, we must avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nNote: when we are at a freeway at a given turn, we must check the car positions at that turn for that freeway.\n\nLet me write down the car information for each freeway at turn 0 (current turn):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> this is a right-moving car. At turn 0, the span is [tau, h] = [-83, -48] (since right-moving: tail is -83, head is -48). \n  - At time T, the car will be at: [ -83 + 36*T, -48 + 36*T ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [ -83 + 36*T, -48 + 36*T ]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [ -83 + 36*T, -48 + 36*T ]\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> [ -71 + 24*T, -48 + 24*T ]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4: [ -71 + 24*T, -48 + 24*T ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 4: [ -71 + 24*T, -48 + 24*T ]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: \n  - (48, 37, right, 4) -> wait, this seems inconsistent: head=48, tail=37? But for a right-moving car, we expect tail <= head. Actually, the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] meaning [tail, head]. So if we see (48,37) and direction right, then we must interpret as head=48 and tail=37? But that would be [37,48] at turn0? However, the problem states: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". \n\nBut note: the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway7, car1: head=48, tail=37? Then at time0: [37,48]? But wait, the problem says the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So for a right-moving car, the head is the front (higher x) and tail is the back (lower x). So the span is [tail, head] = [37,48] at turn0? But the data says (48,37) meaning head=48, tail=37. So that makes sense: [37,48]. \n\nSimilarly, car2: (12,1,right,4) -> [1,12]\ncar3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> [-35,-24]\n\nSo freeway7 at time T: \n  car1: [37+4T, 48+4T]\n  car2: [1+4T, 12+4T]\n  car3: [-35+4T, -24+4T]\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7: three cars with the same parameters.\n\nWe must avoid having 0 in any of these spans when we are on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We start at y0=0 at turn0.\n\nWe must end at y=9. The minimal number of moves if there were no cars: we would go up 9 times (9 turns: from turn0 to turn8, we do 9 moves: at turn8 we would be at y=8, then at turn9 we move to y=9? Actually, let's clarify:\n\nAt turn0: we are at y0=0.\nAfter an action at turn0, we move to y1 at turn1.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at the last turn. So if we do H turns (meaning H actions from turn0 to turn0+H-1), then at turn H we are at y_H.\n\nWe require y_H = 9.\n\nThe minimal H without cars: we do 9 moves of U. Then H=9: \n  turn0: action U -> turn1: y=1\n  turn1: U -> turn2: y=2\n  ...\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn9. Then we stop at turn9? But note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=H-1, and we require that after H actions (at time t1+H-1, which is turn0+H-1) we are at (0,9). Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (which we don't take an action) we are at y=9? Actually, no: the state after the last action is at turn t1+H-1 + 1? Let me see:\n\nWe are at turn t1 (which is 0) at position (0, y0). Then we take an action a_{t1} (at turn0) and move to (0,y1) at turn1.\n\nThen at turn1 we take action a_{t1+1} and move to turn2, etc.\n\nSo after H actions, we have gone through turns: \n  turn0: start\n  turn1: after first action\n  ...\n  turnH: after H actions.\n\nBut the problem says: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. However, the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (the turn when we take the last action) we are at (0,9)? \n\nWait, no: the requirement is: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? Actually, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions ... such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nBut note: the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then the next state (at turn t+1) is y_{t+1}. So:\n\n  At turn0: we are at y0=0.\n  We take a0 at turn0 -> then at turn1 we are at y1 = y0 + delta(a0).\n\nThen we take a1 at turn1 -> at turn2 we are at y2 = y1 + delta(a1).\n\n...\n\nWe take a_{H-1} at turn (H-1) -> then at turn H we are at y_H = y_{H-1} + delta(a_{H-1}).\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. Note that t1=0, so we want y_{H-1} = 9? That would mean that at turn H-1 we are already at 9. Then why take the last action? \n\nActually, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions: at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after these actions is at time t1+H. But the requirement is that at the time of the last action? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is ambiguous. Let me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut note: the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t? Or after the action? Actually, the update rule is: at turn t we take action a_t and then we update to y_{t+1}. So at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning we are at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? \n\nThe requirement: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. But then we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nLet me index:\n\nTurn: t1 (which is 0) -> state: y_{t1} = 0.\nThen we take action a_{t1} (at turn0) -> then at turn1 (which is t1+1) we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nSo after k actions, we are at turn t1+k (with state y_{t1+k}).\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 0+H-1 = H-1) we are at y_{H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn0 (state y0=0). Then:\n\n  After 0 actions: we are at turn0 -> y0=0 (not 9).\n  After 1 action: at turn1 -> y1 = ... \n  ...\n  After k actions: at turn k -> y_k.\n\nWe want to find the minimal H such that after H-1 actions? That doesn't make sense because H is the number of turns? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1. And then we require that at the state at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn H-1) we are at 9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn0. Then we take H actions: at turn0, turn1, ..., turnH-1. Then the state after the last action (which is at turnH) is y_H. But the requirement is about y_{H-1} (the state at the beginning of turn H-1). \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the example: without cars, we would do:\n\n  Turn0: take U -> then at turn1 we are at y1=1.\n  Turn1: take U -> at turn2: y2=2.\n  ...\n  Turn8: take U -> at turn9: y9=9.\n\nSo at turn9, we are at 9. But the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 = 0+H-1 = H-1 we are at 9. So we require y_{H-1}=9. In the example, we want y_{H-1}=9. But in the example, at turn9 we are at 9, so we would set H-1=9? Then H=10? But that would be 10 actions? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that we take H actions and then at the state after the last action we are at 9. But the state after the last action is at turn H. So we require y_H=9. Then without cars, we take 9 actions: from turn0 to turn8, and then at turn9 we are at 9. Then H=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions. And we require that at the state at the turn after the last action (turn0+H = H) we are at 9? But the requirement is written as: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThis discrepancy is critical. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo after H actions (taken at t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1), we have:\n\n  y_{t1+H} = ... \n\nBut the requirement is: we want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\nHowever, the problem explicitly states: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis suggests that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. But then we have taken (t1+H-1) - t1 = H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1. \n\nThis is inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, the index of the state: \n  At turn t1: state is (0, y_{t1})\n  Then we take action a_{t1} -> leads to state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}\n\nWe want to find H and a sequence of H actions (so the last action is at turn t1+H-1) such that at the next state (turn t1+H) we are at 9? But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me look at the answer format: it lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1. And then we stop. So the last state we care about is at turn t1+H? But the requirement is that we are at (0,9) at that last state? \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9. Then we take an action at that turn? But why would we take an action if we are already at 9? \n\nAlternatively, the state y_t is defined AFTER the action of turn t-1? \n\nThe update rule: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nThis implies that at turn t, we are at y_t, and then we take action a_t, which determines Delta y_t, and then we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we take an action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn. The problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThat means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? But the sequence is of H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nI think there is an off-by-one issue. Let me assume that the problem means that after H actions, we are at y=9 at the next turn. That is, at turn t1+H we are at y=9. Then the minimal H without cars is 9: we take 9 actions (U at each of turns0 to 8) and then at turn9 we are at 9.\n\nThen the requirement should be y_{t1+H} = 9. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, without cars, we could do:\n\n  We start at turn0: y0=0.\n  We take action U at turn0 -> turn1: y1=1.\n  ...\n  We take action U at turn8 -> turn9: y9=9.\n\nThen we have taken 9 actions (from turn0 to turn8) and then at turn9 we are at 9. So we want to be at 9 at turn9. The problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. Here, t1=0, so we want y_{H-1}=9. So if H=9, then we want y_8=9? But we are at y8=8 at turn8. \n\nSo we would need to take one more action: at turn8 we are at 8, then we take U at turn8 to go to 9 at turn9. But then we are at 9 at turn9. So we want y_{H-1}=y_8=8? That is not 9.\n\nTherefore, the requirement must be that after H actions, we are at 9 at turn t1+H. But the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem means that we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. And the minimal H without cars is 9 actions (H=9), leading to y9=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions. So H is the number of actions. And then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis does not match. \n\nAnother possibility: the state y_t is defined at the end of turn t? Then:\n\n  At turn0: we start and then take action a0, then at the end of turn0 we are at y0? But the problem says initial position (0, y_{t1}) at current turn t1. So it must be at the beginning.\n\nI think the problem has a typo. Given that in the car update rule, they use T>t1, and they say \"at turn T\", I think the state is at the beginning of the turn.\n\nTo resolve, let me look at the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\nAnd note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn T, you are at y_T, and you are on freeway y_T for the entire turn T? And then you move at the end of turn T to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo the collision check at turn T is for the entire turn T, and you are at y_T.\n\nTherefore, we require that for every turn T from t1 to the turn when we are at 9, we are safe.\n\nBut note: when we reach y=9, we are at freeway 9, which has no cars. So we only care from turn0 to turn8 (if we are on freeways 1 to 8).\n\nNow, the requirement: we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn. The problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? But the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nThen at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn? But then we might move away? \n\nThe problem doesn't say we stop immediately. It only says we must reach (0,9). So once we are at (0,9), we can stop. But the actions are given for H turns. \n\nAlternatively, we can stop as soon as we reach (0,9). So the last action is the one that gets us to 9. But then we would be at 9 at the next turn. \n\nI think the safest is to assume that the requirement is to have y_{t1+H} = 9. And then H is the number of actions. And the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nGiven the confusion, and since the problem is from a contest, I will assume that the intended meaning is that after H actions, we are at y=9 at the next turn, i.e., at turn t1+H we are at 9. Then the minimal H without cars is 9. \n\nBut then the requirement should be y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nHowever, to match the problem's statement, I will try to find a sequence such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. This means we are at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1, and then we take an action at turn H-1 (which might be S, U, or D) but we are already at 9. If we go U, we would go to 10, but y is capped at 9, so it would be 9. Similarly, D would go to 8. So if we are at 9, we should do S to stay.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", so once we are at 9, we can stop. But the sequence must be given for H actions, and the last action might be at a turn when we are already at 9.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the minimal H is the number of turns that we are in the game including the starting turn? But then without cars, we would be at turn0:0, turn1:1, ..., turn9:9. So we need 10 turns? Then H=10, and we take actions from turn0 to turn9? But then at turn9 we take an action, and then at turn10 we are at y10. But we want to be at 9 at turn9? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". With t1=0, so y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIf H=10, then y_{9}=9. So we are at 9 at turn9. Then the actions are from turn0 to turn9: 10 actions. But then after the action at turn9, we would be at turn10: y10 = y9 + action. But we are at y9=9 at the beginning of turn9. Then we take an action at turn9 (the 10th action) and then at turn10 we are at y10. But the requirement is only on y_{9}=9, not on y10.\n\nSo we would do:\n\n  Actions at turn0 to turn8: to get to y9=9 at the beginning of turn9.\n  Then at turn9, we take any action (say S) to complete the sequence.\n\nBut then the last action is at turn9, and we are at 9 at turn9.\n\nThis matches the requirement: y_{t1+H-1} = y_{0+10-1}=y9=9.\n\nAnd we took 10 actions.\n\nWithout cars, we can do:\n  turn0: U -> y1=1 at turn1\n  turn1: U -> y2=2 at turn2\n  ...\n  turn8: U -> y9=9 at turn9\n  turn9: S (or any, but we are at 9) -> then at turn10: y10=9.\n\nBut the requirement is only that at turn9 (which is t1+H-1=0+10-1=9) we are at 9. So it's satisfied.\n\nMinimal H without cars: H=10.\n\nBut intuitively, we might think it's 9 actions to get to 9, but here we need an extra action at the end? That seems odd.\n\nGiven the problem's explicit requirement: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", we will design for that.\n\nSo we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn H-1 (since t1=0).\n\nAnd we take H actions: at turns0 to H-1.\n\nThe minimal H without cars: we want to be at 9 at turn H-1. We start at turn0 at 0. So we need to go from 0 to 9 in H-1 turns? Because from turn0 to turn H-1, there are (H-1) - 0 = H-1 steps.\n\nEach step we can increase by at most 1. So we need at least 9 steps. So the earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn9. Therefore, we need H-1>=9 => H>=10.\n\nSo minimal H without cars is 10. Then we are at 9 at turn9 (H-1=9), and we took 10 actions: from turn0 to turn9.\n\nSo now, with cars, we will try to achieve being at 9 at turn9 (i.e., at the beginning of turn9) with a sequence of 10 actions (from turn0 to turn9).\n\nBut note: we may take more than 10 actions if we have to wait.\n\nHowever, the minimal H might be more than 10 if we have to wait for cars.\n\nWe are to minimize H.\n\nWe are at turn0: y0=0.\nWe will simulate turns 0 to 9 (at turn9 we must be at y9=9).\n\nBut note: at each turn t, we are at y_t, and then we choose an action that determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at turn t if there is a car on freeway k at turn t that covers x=0.\n\nWe need to find a path from y0=0 to y9=9 in 9 steps (because from turn0 to turn9, there are 9 state transitions) such that for every turn t from 0 to 9, when we are at y_t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on that freeway at turn t and ensure 0 is not in any of their spans.\n\nNote: at turn9, we are at y9=9, which is safe.\n\nAt turn0, we are at y0=0, safe.\n\nSo we care about turns 1 to 8: when we are at freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe will simulate the car positions at each turn for each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's precompute for each freeway and for each turn t (from 0 to, say, 20) whether freeway k is safe at turn t.\n\nFreeway k is safe at turn t if for every car on freeway k, 0 is not in its span at turn t.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: right-moving, initial span at turn0: [ -83, -48] (because tail=-83, head=-48). \n  At turn t: [ -83 + 36*t, -48 + 36*t ]\n\nWe need to know when 0 is in [ -83+36t, -48+36t ].\n\n  -83+36t <= 0 <= -48+36t  ?\n\n  =>  36t <= 83  => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> t<=2\n      36t >= 48  => t>=48/36 = 4/3≈1.333 -> t>=2\n\n  So only at t=2: \n      lower = -83+36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n      upper = -48+72 = 24\n      -11<=0<=24 -> yes.\n\n  Also, check t=1: \n      lower = -83+36 = -47\n      upper = -48+36 = -12 -> 0 is not in [-47, -12]? Actually, no because -47<=0 is true, but 0<=-12 is false. So not in.\n\n  t=3: \n      lower = -83+108=25\n      upper = -48+108=60 -> 0 not in [25,60].\n\n  So freeway1 is unsafe only at turn2.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1 -> unsafe only at turn2.\n\nFreeway3: same -> unsafe only at turn2.\n\nFreeway4: car: [ -71 + 24*t, -48 + 24*t ]\n\n  Check when 0 is in [ -71+24t, -48+24t ]:\n\n  -71+24t <= 0 <= -48+24t\n\n  => 24t<=71 -> t<=71/24≈2.958 -> t<=2\n      24t>=48 -> t>=2\n\n  So at t=2: \n      lower = -71+48 = -23\n      upper = -48+48=0\n      -23<=0<=0 -> true.\n\n  But note: the interval is inclusive, so 0 is included.\n\n  At t=3:\n      lower = -71+72=1, upper= -48+72=24 -> 0 not in [1,24].\n\n  At t=1:\n      lower = -71+24 = -47, upper=-48+24=-24 -> 0 not in [-47,-24].\n\n  So freeway4 unsafe only at turn2.\n\nFreeway5: same as 4 -> unsafe at turn2.\n\nFreeway6: same -> unsafe at turn2.\n\nFreeway7: three cars:\n\n  car1: [37+4t, 48+4t] -> always positive for t>=0, and since 37+4*0=37>0, so 0 is never in this interval.\n\n  car2: [1+4t, 12+4t] -> at t=0: [1,12] -> doesn't include 0.\n        t=1: [5,16] -> no\n        always positive, so never includes 0.\n\n  car3: [-35+4t, -24+4t] \n        Check when 0 is in [-35+4t, -24+4t]:\n        -35+4t <= 0 <= -24+4t\n        => 4t<=35 -> t<=8.75\n            4t>=24 -> t>=6\n        So for t=6,7,8:\n\n          t=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n          t=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4] -> includes 0.\n          t=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8] -> includes 0.\n\n        And t=5: [-35+20, -24+20] = [-15,-4] -> no.\n        t=9: [1,12] -> no.\n\n        So car3 is unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\n  Therefore, freeway7 is unsafe at t=6,7,8 (because of car3).\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways at each turn:\n\n  turn0: all freeways safe? \n      freeways1-6: at t0: \n          freeway1: [ -83, -48] -> 0 not in (since -83<=0<=-48 is false) -> safe.\n          similarly, freeway2,3: safe.\n          freeway4: [-71,-48] -> safe.\n          freeway5,6: safe.\n          freeway7: car1: [37,48] -> safe; car2: [1,12] -> safe; car3: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n          freeway8: same.\n\n  turn1: similarly, freeways1-6: \n          freeway1: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12] -> safe.\n          freeway4: [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24] -> safe.\n          freeway7: car3: [-35+4, -24+4] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\n\n  turn2: \n          freeway1: [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24] -> unsafe (0 is in).\n          freeway2: same -> unsafe.\n          freeway3: same -> unsafe.\n          freeway4: [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23,0] -> unsafe (0 is included).\n          freeway5: same -> unsafe.\n          freeway6: same -> unsafe.\n          freeway7: car3: [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n          freeway8: same.\n\n  turn3: \n          freeway1: [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> safe.\n          freeway4: [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24] -> safe.\n          freeway7: car3: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  turn4,5: safe for all.\n\n  turn6:\n          freeway7: car3: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> unsafe (0 included).\n          freeway8: same -> unsafe.\n          others: safe.\n\n  turn7:\n          freeway7: car3: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n          freeway8: same.\n\n  turn8:\n          freeway7: car3: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n          freeway8: same.\n\n  turn9: \n          freeway7: car3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe.\n          others safe.\n\nSo unsafe moments:\n\n  freeway1: turn2\n  freeway2: turn2\n  freeway3: turn2\n  freeway4: turn2\n  freeway5: turn2\n  freeway6: turn2\n  freeway7: turn6,7,8\n  freeway8: turn6,7,8\n\nWe need to be at y_t at turn t, and we want to avoid being on freeway k at turn t if freeway k is unsafe at turn t.\n\nWe start at turn0: y0=0 (safe).\nWe need to be at turn9: y9=9 (safe).\n\nWe make moves: at each turn t (0 to 8), we choose an action (U, D, S) that determines y_{t+1}.\n\nConstraints: \n  0 <= y_{t} <= 9.\n\nAnd for t from 0 to 9, we must be safe at (0, y_t) at turn t.\n\nBut note: at turn0: y0=0 (safe).\nAt turn9: y9=9 (safe).\n\nWe care about turns t=1 to 8: y1 to y8 must be safe (if in 1..8) or 0 or 9 (which are safe).\n\nOur goal: y9=9.\n\nWe want to minimize H, the number of actions. But we've established that minimal H without obstacles is 10, so we aim for H=10.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of 10 actions: a0 to a9, such that:\n\n  y0 = 0\n  y1 = y0 + a0 (which is 0,1, or -1? but at y0=0, D would leave at 0? Actually, D: y1 = 0-1 = -1? but then capped to 0? The rule: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go below 0, we stay at 0.\n\nBut note: the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then clamped to [0,9]? The problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 0 and choose D, then y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, at 9, U leaves at 9.\n\nSo we can model:\n\n  y_{t+1} = clamp(y_t + a_t, 0, 9)\n\nwhere a_t: U -> +1, D->-1, S->0.\n\nWe need to be at y9=9.\n\nWe have unsafe conditions at specific turns for specific freeways.\n\nWe want to be at y9=9 at turn9.\n\nWe can do a BFS or dynamic programming over the turns and positions.\n\nStates: (turn, y) for turn in [0,9] and y in [0,9]. We start at (0,0). We want to be at (9,9).\n\nAt each state (t,y), we choose an action a in {U, D, S} and then:\n\n  next_y = clamp(y + delta(a), 0, 9)\n\nThen we go to state (t+1, next_y).\n\nBut note: we also need to check that at state (t,y) we are safe. That is, at turn t, being at y must be safe.\n\nHowever, at the next state (t+1, next_y) we will check safety at turn t+1.\n\nSo the safety check for a state (t,y) is: if y is between 1 and 8, then we must check that freeway y is safe at turn t.\n\nWe do not check safety for y=0 or y=9.\n\nWe simulate from t=0 to t=9.\n\nAt t=0: we start at (0,0) -> safe.\n\nThen we choose an action -> leads to (1, y1).\n\nAt (1,y1): we check safety at turn1: \n  if y1 in [1,8], then we check the freeway y1 at turn1. But we know all freeways are safe at turn1.\n\nThen we continue.\n\nWe want to reach (9,9).\n\nWe are going to do a BFS for the minimal H? But H is fixed at 10? We are forced to take 10 actions? \n\nBut note: we might take more than 10 actions if we cannot reach by turn9. However, the problem says minimal H. We start at H=10 and see if we can achieve. If not, we try H=11, etc.\n\nBut let's first try to see if we can do it in 10 actions.\n\nWe have 9 steps to go from y0=0 to y9=9. We must have at least 9 U moves. But we have 10 actions, so we can have 9 U and 1 S, or 9 U and 1 D (but then we might drop and have to go up again).\n\nBut we cannot afford to go down because we need to be at 9 at turn9.\n\nWe must have net +9 in 9 steps (from turn0 to turn9: 9 moves). But we have 10 moves? \n\nWait: we have 10 actions: a0 to a9. These 10 actions will determine y1 to y10. But we require y9=9? \n\nBut the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=y9=9. So we require at turn9 (which is the 9th turn) we are at 9.\n\nThe state at turn9 is y9. How is y9 determined? \n  y1 = y0 + a0\n  y2 = y1 + a1\n  ...\n  y9 = y8 + a8\n\nNote: the action a9 is taken at turn9, which determines y10, but we don't care about y10.\n\nSo we require y9=9.\n\nThe actions a0 to a8 determine y1 to y9. The action a9 is taken at turn9 but doesn't affect y9 (it affects y10).\n\nSo to have y9=9, we only care about a0 to a8. \n\nThe net effect of a0 to a8: \n  y9 = y0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a8) [clamped at each step, but since we are moving from 0 to 9 and we are only going up and possibly down, we must have at least 9 U in these 9 actions? \n\nBut we have 9 actions (a0 to a8) and we start at 0. We need to end at 9. So the net change must be +9. \n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo the sum of the deltas for a0 to a8 must be 9.\n\nThe only way is to have 9 U and 0 D and 0 S? \n\nBut then we have 9 U's: then y1=1, y2=2, ..., y9=9.\n\nBut we have an extra action a9 at turn9. We can do anything: S, U, or D. But we are at 9, so if we do U, we stay at 9. If we do D, we go to 8. But the requirement is only y9=9, not y10. So we can do a9 = S.\n\nSo the minimal sequence without cars is: \n  a0 to a8: U, and a9: S.\n\nBut now we have obstacles. We must avoid being on an unsafe freeway at the turn when it is unsafe.\n\nWith the sequence of 9 U's: \n  turn0: at y0=0 (safe) -> then we go to y1=1 at turn1.\n  turn1: at y1=1 -> we are on freeway1 at turn1. But freeway1 is safe at turn1? Yes, as we computed earlier.\n  turn2: at y2=2 -> freeway2 at turn2: unsafe! (because freeway2 is unsafe at turn2)\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1 to 6 at turn2? But we are at y2=2 at turn2 -> freeway2 -> unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on freeways 1 to 6 at turn2.\n\nWe also must avoid freeways7 and 8 at turns6,7,8.\n\nSo we need to design a path that:\n\n  - At turn2, we are not on any freeway in {1,2,3,4,5,6}. \n    That means at turn2, we must be at y2=0 or y2=9? But we start at 0, and we are at turn2: we can only be at 0,1,2. So we cannot be at 9. So we must be at 0 at turn2? \n\n    Alternatively, we could be at freeway7 or 8? But freeway7 and 8 are safe at turn2.\n\n    So at turn2, we can be at freeway7 or 8? But we start at 0, and we have two moves: \n        turn0: from 0, we can go to 1 (U) or stay at 0 (S) or go down (but still 0).\n        turn1: from y1, we choose an action.\n\n    How to be at freeway7 or 8 at turn2? \n\n        freeway7 is y=7, freeway8 is y=8.\n\n        We start at 0. In two moves (turn0 and turn1), we can go up to 2 at most. So we cannot be at 7 or 8 at turn2.\n\n    Therefore, the only safe option at turn2 is to be at y2=0.\n\nSo we must be at 0 at turn2.\n\nThen we have:\n\n  y0=0\n  y1 = ? \n  y2 = 0\n\nFrom y0=0, to have y2=0:\n\n  Option1: \n      a0: S -> y1=0\n      a1: S -> y2=0\n  Option2:\n      a0: D -> y1=0 (because clamped)\n      a1: S -> y2=0\n  Option3:\n      a0: S, a1: D -> y1=0, y2=0\n  Option4:\n      a0: D, a1: D -> y1=0, y2=0\n  Option5:\n      a0: U -> y1=1\n      then a1: D -> y2=0\n\nBut note: at turn1, we are at y1. If we choose a0=U, then at turn1 we are at y1=1. Then freeway1 at turn1: safe? yes. Then a1=D: then at turn2 we are at y2=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we do a0=S, then at turn1 we are at 0 (safe), then a1=S: turn2 at 0.\n\nBut we also have to eventually get to 9 at turn9.\n\nWe have 7 moves (from turn2 to turn9: actions a2 to a9) to go from y2=0 to y9=9. That requires net +9 in 7 moves? \n\nBut 7 U's would get us to 7, but we need 9. So we need at least 9 moves from 0 to 9. But we only have 7 moves? \n\nWait, from turn2 to turn9: \n  We are at turn2: y2=0.\n  We take actions a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9: 8 actions? \n\nBut note: the actions from a2 to a9 are 8 actions, and they will determine y3 to y10. But we only care about y9.\n\n  y3 = y2 + a2\n  y4 = y3 + a3\n  ...\n  y9 = y8 + a8\n  y10 = y9 + a9\n\nWe require y9=9.\n\nSo the actions a2 to a8 (7 actions) determine y3 to y9. \n\nWe start at y2=0, and we need y9=9. So we need to cover 9 in 7 moves. The net of a2 to a8 must be 9.\n\nEach action can give at most +1. So the maximum we can get is 7. So we cannot get to 9.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at 0 at turn2 and then get to 9 at turn9 with only 7 actions (a2 to a8).\n\nWe need more than 10 actions.\n\nWe must increase H.\n\nWe try H=11. Then we require y_{11-1}=y10=9.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at turn10.\n\nThen we take 11 actions: a0 to a10.\n\nThe net from a0 to a9 must be 9 (since y10 = y0 + sum_{i=0}^{9} a_i = 0 + net).\n\nWe have 10 actions (a0 to a9) to get from 0 to 9. So net +9: so we need 9 U's and 1 S (or 9 U's and 1 D? but then net would be 8, not 9).\n\nSo we must have exactly 9 U's and 1 S (or 1 extra action that is not U, but we have 10 actions) in the first 10 actions (a0 to a9). Then the 11th action (a10) can be anything (but we are at 9, so S).\n\nNow, we have more flexibility: we can delay our ascent.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n  - At turn2: being on freeway 1-6 -> so we must be at 0 or 7 or 8 or 9 at turn2. But we start at 0, so in two moves we can be at 0,1,2. We cannot be at 7 or 8 or 9. So we must be at 0 or 1? But freeway1 at turn2 is unsafe, so we cannot be at 1. Freeway2 at turn2 is unsafe, but we won't be at 2? We are limited to 0,1,2. So only 0 is safe.\n\n  Therefore, we must be at 0 at turn2.\n\nThen from turn2 to turn10: we have 8 moves (actions a2 to a9) to go from 0 to 9. That is 8 actions for 9 steps? We need net +9 in 8 actions: then we can do 9 U's and -1 (one D) or 8 U's and 1 extra? But 8 U's only give 8. So we need 9 U's and one non-U that doesn't cost a step? We have 8 actions. We need to gain 9. Impossible.\n\nWe need 9 gains. But with 8 actions, the maximum gain is 8.\n\nSo we must be at 0 at turn2, and then we have from turn2 to turn10: 8 state changes (y2 to y10) to go from 0 to 9. We need to cover 9 units in 8 steps: that is possible if we have 8 U's and 1 wait? But we only have 8 actions. \n\nWe have 8 actions: a2 to a9. They will determine y3 to y10. We require y10=9.\n\n  y3 = y2 + a2\n  ...\n  y10 = y9 + a9\n\nWe start at y2=0, and we want y10=9.\n\nThe net of a2 to a9 must be 9.\n\nWith 8 actions, the net can be at most 8. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at 0 at turn2. We must find a safe haven.\n\nBut we concluded that at turn2, the only safe freeways are 0,7,8,9. And we can only be at 0,1,2. So 0 is the only safe haven.\n\nBut then we are stuck.\n\nWhat about being on freeway7 or 8 at turn2? We can't because we can't reach them in two moves.\n\nUnless we use a different strategy: maybe we go down? But we are at 0, and down leaves us at 0.\n\nSo the only states at turn2 are 0,1,2.\n\nAnd 1 and 2 are unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at 0.\n\nBut then we cannot reach 9 at turn10 either.\n\nSo we try H=12.\n\nThen we require y_{12-1}=y11=9.\n\nActions: 12 actions: a0 to a11.\n\nNet of a0 to a10 must be 9 (since y11 = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{10} a_i).\n\nWe have 11 actions to net +9: so we can have 9 U's and 2 S's, for example.\n\nAnd we must be at turn11 at 9.\n\nNow, at turn2, we still must be at 0.\n\nThen from turn2 to turn11: we have 9 actions (a2 to a10) to net 9 (because y2=0, and we want y11=9, and y11 = y2 + a2 + a3 + ... + a10).\n\nSo net of a2 to a10 must be 9. With 9 actions, we can do 9 U's.\n\nSo we can do: a0: U, a1: D -> then at turn2: y2=0.\n        then a2 to a10: 9 U's.\n\nBut then at turn11: y11=9. And then a11: S.\n\nNow, we need to check safety:\n\n  turn0: y0=0 (safe)\n  turn1: y1 = y0 + a0 = 0+1=1 -> freeway1 at turn1: safe.\n  turn2: y2 = y1 + a1 = 1-1=0 (safe)\n  turn3: y3 = 0+U=1 -> freeway1 at turn3: safe (only unsafe at turn2)\n  turn4: y4=2 -> freeway2 at turn4: safe (only unsafe at turn2)\n  turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3 at turn5: safe\n  turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4 at turn6: safe (freeway4 only unsafe at turn2)\n  turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5: safe\n  turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6: safe\n  turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7 at turn9: safe? freeway7 is unsafe at turn6,7,8, but turn9 is safe.\n  turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8 at turn10: we haven't computed for turn10. \n\n  Let's check freeway8 at turn10: \n      car3 on freeway8: at turn10: [-35+4*10, -24+4*10] = [5,16] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n  turn11: y11=9 (safe)\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nAnd we are at y11=9 at turn11.\n\nThe actions:\n\n  a0 = U\n  a1 = D\n  a2 = U\n  a3 = U\n  a4 = U\n  a5 = U\n  a6 = U\n  a7 = U\n  a8 = U\n  a9 = U\n  a10 = U  # because we need 9 U's from a2 to a10: that's 9 actions: a2 to a10.\n  a11 = S  # to complete the 12 actions.\n\nBut wait, from a2 to a10 is 9 actions: a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10 -> 9 U's.\n\nThen a11: S.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns0 to 11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We have H=12. But we could try to see if we can do it in 11 or 10 by being at a safe freeway at turn2 that we can reach. We already ruled out freeway7 and 8 at turn2 because we can't reach them.\n\nAlternatively, could we be at freeway7 or 8 at turn2 if we use a teleport? No.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let me double-check the net: \n  a0: U -> +1\n  a1: D -> -1\n  a2 to a10: 9 U's -> +9\n  a11: S -> 0\n  total net: 1-1+9=9 -> y11 = 0+9=9.\n\nAnd the safety at each turn:\n\n  turn0: y0=0: safe.\n  turn1: y1=1: freeway1 at turn1: safe.\n  turn2: y2=0: safe.\n  turn3: y3=1: freeway1 at turn3: safe.\n  turn4: y4=2: freeway2 at turn4: safe.\n  turn5: y5=3: freeway3 at turn5: safe.\n  turn6: y6=4: freeway4 at turn6: safe.\n  turn7: y7=5: freeway5 at turn7: safe.\n  turn8: y8=6: freeway6 at turn8: safe.\n  turn9: y9=7: freeway7 at turn9: safe (since freeway7 unsafe at 6,7,8 but not 9).\n  turn10: y10=8: freeway8 at turn10: safe (as computed: [5,16]).\n  turn11: y11=9: safe.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could have done:\n\n  a0: S, a1: D (but D from 0 is 0) -> then a0=S: y1=0, a1=D: y2=0.\n  then a2 to a10: 9 U's -> then y11=9.\n\nThen:\n  turn0:0 safe.\n  turn1:0 safe.\n  turn2:0 safe.\n  turn3:1 (freeway1 safe)\n  ... same as above.\n\nBut then we used a0=S and a1=D, which is the same net as a0=U and a1=D: net 0.\n\nBut in the first two actions, we have one U and one D, or two S's, or one S and one D, etc., as long as at turn2 we are at 0.\n\nBut the net for the entire journey is still 9.\n\nWe choose the first option: a0=U, a1=D, then 9 U's, then a11=S.\n\nNow, the answer format:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}   (t1=0)\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+11: a_{t1+11}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut we have 12 actions. Is there a way with 11 actions? We argued that at turn2 we must be at 0, and then from turn2 to turn11 (9 steps) we need to go from 0 to 9, which requires 9 U's. So 9 actions. Then the first two actions and the last action? \n\nIn the above, we have 12 actions. But if we want H=11, then we would be at turn11: and we require y_{11-1}=y10=9.\n\nThen we take actions a0 to a10 (11 actions).\n\nThe net of a0 to a9 must be 9 (since y10 = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{9} a_i).\n\nWe must be at 0 at turn2.\n\nFrom turn2 to turn10: we have actions a2 to a9 (8 actions) to net 9? Impossible.\n\nSo H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could avoid being at 0 at turn2 by being at a safe freeway. But there is none in the range we can reach.\n\nOne more idea: could we be at freeway7 or 8 at turn2 by going down? But we start at 0 and can only go up or stay. So no.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence.\n\nBut note: at turn9: we are at y9=7? In our sequence:\n\n  turn0:0 -> a0=U -> turn1:1\n  turn1:1 -> a1=D -> turn2:0\n  turn2:0 -> a2=U -> turn3:1\n  turn3:1 -> a3=U -> turn4:2\n  turn4:2 -> a4=U -> turn5:3\n  turn5:3 -> a5=U -> turn6:4\n  turn6:4 -> a6=U -> turn7:5\n  turn7:5 -> a7=U -> turn8:6\n  turn8:6 -> a8=U -> turn9:7\n  turn9:7 -> a9=U -> turn10:8\n  turn10:8 -> a10=U -> turn11:9\n  turn11:9 -> a11=S -> turn12:9 (but we don't care)\n\nBut at turn9: y9=7, which is freeway7, and we said freeway7 is safe at turn9? \n  freeway7 at turn9: car3: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [1,12] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nAt turn10: freeway8: car3: [-35+40, -24+40] = [5,16] -> safe.\n\nSo it's okay.\n\nBut note: we require to be at 9 at turn11 (which is the beginning of turn11). We are at 9 at turn11 (because after a10 at turn10, we go to y11=9).\n\nSo the sequence has 12 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=12.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut note: the initial turn is t1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut we have 12 actions. The last action is at turn11.\n\nWe could possibly avoid the last action? But we need 12 actions because H=12.\n\nAlternatively, could we do without the last action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and we have to specify 12 actions.\n\nBut note: after the 12th action (at turn11), we are at turn12: y12=9. But we don't care about y12. The requirement is y_{11}=9 (because for H=12, we want y_{0+12-1}=y11=9). And we are at y11=9 at the beginning of turn11? \n\nWait, no: \n\n  At the beginning of turn11, we are at y11. How did we get y11? \n      y11 = y10 + a10.\n\n  We had y10=8 (at the beginning of turn10) and then we did a10=U at turn10 -> then at turn11, we are at y11=9.\n\n  Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. Then we take a11=S at turn11 -> then at turn12, y12=9.\n\n  But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn11 (y11) we are at 9. And we are. So the action a11 is taken after we are already at 9. \n\n  We could possibly not take that action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions. And H=12.\n\n  However, if we can achieve being at 9 at turn11 with only 11 actions, then we would set H=11. But we cannot because we need 9 U's after turn2, and that requires 9 actions (a2 to a10) which are 9 actions. Then a0 and a1 are 2 actions, so total 11 actions. \n\n  But then we would be at turn11: and we want y_{11} = 9. How is y11 determined? \n        y11 = y10 + a10.\n        But y10 = y9 + a9 = ... and we have a0 to a10: 11 actions.\n\n  In this case, we don't need a11.\n\n  So if we set H=11, then the sequence is a0 to a10, and we require y_{11}=9.\n\n  How do we get y11? \n        We start at y0=0.\n        y1 = y0+a0\n        ...\n        y11 = y10 + a10.\n\n  We want y11=9.\n\n  In our plan: \n        a0: U -> y1=1\n        a1: D -> y2=0\n        a2: U -> y3=1\n        a3: U -> y4=2\n        a4: U -> y5=3\n        a5: U -> y6=4\n        a6: U -> y7=5\n        a7: U -> y8=6\n        a8: U -> y9=7\n        a9: U -> y10=8\n        a10: U -> y11=9\n\n  Then we stop. We don't need a11.\n\n  And we are at y11=9 at turn11.\n\n  Safety: \n        turn0:0 safe.\n        turn1:1 safe.\n        turn2:0 safe.\n        turn3:1 safe.\n        ...\n        turn10:8 -> freeway8 at turn10: safe (as computed: car3: [5,16] at turn10).\n        turn11:9 safe.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  Therefore, we can do with H=11.\n\n  The sequence has 11 actions: a0 to a10.\n\n  Then the minimal H is 11.\n\n  We output:\n\n      Turn 0: U\n      Turn 1: D\n      Turn 2: U\n      Turn 3: U\n      Turn 4: U\n      Turn 5: U\n      Turn 6: U\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n\n  This gets us to y11=9 at turn11.\n\n  And we avoid all unsafe moments.\n\n  So we don't need the extra S at the end.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nLet me confirm the turns:\n\n  turn0: start at 0.\n        a0=U -> then at turn1: y1=1.\n  turn1: at y1=1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn1 is safe). Then a1=D -> then at turn2: y2=0.\n  turn2: at y2=0 -> safe. Then a2=U -> turn3: y3=1.\n  turn3: y3=1 -> freeway1 at turn3: safe. Then a3=U -> turn4: y4=2.\n  turn4: y4=2 -> freeway2 at turn4: safe. Then a4=U -> turn5: y5=3.\n  turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3 at turn5: safe. Then a5=U -> turn6: y6=4.\n  turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4 at turn6: safe. Then a6=U -> turn7: y7=5.\n  turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5 at turn7: safe. Then a7=U -> turn8: y8=6.\n  turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6 at turn8: safe. Then a8=U -> turn9: y9=7.\n  turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7 at turn9: safe. Then a9=U -> turn10: y10=8.\n  turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8 at turn10: safe. Then a10=U -> turn11: y11=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the answer is 11 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=10 or less? \n\nWe require y_{H-1}=9. For H=10, we require y9=9. Then we must net 9 in 9 actions (a0 to a8). \n\nBut at turn2, we must be at 0. \n\nFrom turn0 to turn2: we have two actions, and we must end at 0. The net for a0 and a1 must be 0. \n\nThen from turn2 to turn9: we have 7 actions (a2 to a8) to net 9. But maximum net is 7. So impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the following sequence of actions is determined. The unsafe conditions are as follows:\n- Freeways 1 to 6 are unsafe at turn 2.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8.\n\nThe strategy is:\n- At turn 0, move up to y=1 (safe, as freeway 1 is safe at turn 1).\n- At turn 1, move down to y=0 (safe, as y=0 has no cars), avoiding being on freeways 1-6 at turn 2.\n- From turn 2 to turn 10, move up consecutively to reach y=9 by turn 11.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 2, y=0 (safe).\n- From turn 3 to turn 5, moving through freeways 1-5 (safe, as these freeways are only unsafe at turn 2).\n- At turn 6, y=4 (freeway 4 is safe at turn 6).\n- At turn 7, y=5 (freeway 5 is safe at turn 7).\n- At turn 8, y=6 (freeway 6 is safe at turn 8).\n- At turn 9, y=7 (freeway 7 is safe at turn 9, as it is unsafe only at turns 6-8).\n- At turn 10, y=8 (freeway 8 is safe at turn 10, as car spans do not include 0).\n- At turn 11, y=9 (goal reached, and y=9 has no cars).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11, as fewer turns (e.g., 10) cannot achieve y=9 by turn 9 while avoiding unsafe conditions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: D \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 2. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollisions happen only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T, and at that turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span. The span is the positions occupied by the car at that turn.\n\nCars move horizontally: left-moving cars have decreasing positions, right-moving have increasing. The span is given as [head, tail] or [tail, head], but I need to be careful with the order.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so positions decrease. For right-moving, it's [τ, h] and moves right, positions increase. But in the update, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)], which since h > τ for left-moving, I assume, because head is at higher position? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36). Since direction is right, and it's given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, it should be [tail, head]? No, let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]. Since it's left-moving, h should be greater than τ, I think, because head is leading to the left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]. And for right-moving, τ should be less than h, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a car, head and tail might not be in order.\n\nLook at freeway 7 and 8: they have multiple cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4). Since direction is right, and for each, head and tail: for (56,45,right,4), 56 and 45, with direction right, so since it's moving right, the head should be at higher position? But 56 > 45, so if head is 56 and tail is 45, and moving right, that would mean the car is from 45 to 56, so tail at 45, head at 56, so τ=45, h=56, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [45,56] for t_1=2.\n\nSimilarly, for (20,9,right,4), head=20, tail=9, so τ=9, h=20, Span=[9,20].\n\nFor (-16,-27,right,4), head=-16, tail=-27, so τ=-27, h=-16, Span=[-27,-16].\n\nAnd all moving right.\n\nNow for freeway 1: (24,-11,right,36), direction right, head=24, tail=-11. Since moving right, and head=24, tail=-11, but -11 < 24, so τ should be min, h max? In the notation, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h. Here tail=-11, head=24, so τ=-11, h=24, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11,24].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars given are right-moving, I think.\n\nCheck freeways 1 to 6: all have direction right, and freeways 7 and 8 also right.\n\nFreeway 1: right, freeway 2: right, etc. All are right-moving cars.\n\nNo left-moving cars in this state.\n\nt_1 = 2, current turn.\n\nPlayer at (0,0).\n\nWe need to reach (0,9).\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, to move from y=0 to y=9, we need to pass through y=1 to 8, but we can skip some by moving up or down, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, we need to go up, but we might stay or move down to avoid cars.\n\nBut moving down might not help since we need to reach 9.\n\nAlso, time matters because cars are moving.\n\nThe key point is that at each turn when we are on a freeway y, we need that for that y, at that turn, 0 is not in the car span for any car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that when we move to a new y, we are not on that y until the next turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, when you take an action at turn T, it affects your position at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn T, you are at position y_T.\n\nYou choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are at y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T for your position y_T.\n\nFor that y_T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nSince cars move over time, we need to compute for each turn and each freeway where the cars are.\n\nt_1 = 2 is the current turn.\n\nAt turn t=2, player is at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible at t=2.\n\nNow, we start from t=2, position y=0.\n\nWe take actions from t=2 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn starting from t=2.\n\nSet t=2 as time zero for simplicity? But the car positions are given at t_1=2.\n\nDefine the time relative to t_1.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t_1=2.\n\nPlayer position: at τ=0, y=0.\n\nThen after action a_{t_1 + τ} for τ from 0 to H-1, we reach y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we should be at y=9.\n\nStart at turn t_1: position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we move to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nGenerally, at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want that at some turn T = t_1 + H, y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H, since we start actions at t_1, and after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, at t_1, we are at position, we take action a_{t_1}, then at t_1+1, we are at new position.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + k} =9 for some k, and minimal k.\n\nk is the number of turns from start.\n\nH is the number of actions, so after H actions, we have taken H steps, and at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we need to specify the actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1 for actions.\n\nNow, back to cars.\n\nFirst, list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nSince dir right, at turn t_1=2, span is [τ, h] = [min, max], but tail=-11, head=24, so τ = tail = -11, h = head =24, so Span(2) = [ -11, 24 ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: same car: (24, -11, right, 36), so Span(2) = [-11, 24]\n\nFreeway y=3: same, (24,-11,right,36), Span(2) = [-11,24]\n\nFreeway y=4: (0,-23,right,24), so head=0, tail=-23, dir right, so τ = tail = -23, h = head =0, Span(2) = [ -23, 0 ]\n\nSimilarly, y=5: same, (0,-23,right,24), Span(2) = [-23,0]\n\ny=6: same, (0,-23,right,24), Span(2) = [-23,0]\n\nNow freeway y=7: three cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nFor each, since right dir:\n\nFirst car: head=56, tail=45, so τ=45, h=56, Span(2) = [45,56]\n\nSecond car: head=20, tail=9, τ=9, h=20, Span(2) = [9,20]\n\nThird car: head=-16, tail=-27, τ=-27, h=-16, Span(2) = [-27,-16]\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4), so same spans at t=2.\n\nNow, at time T, for a given freeway, the span of each car at turn T is as above with T instead of t_1.\n\nSince t_1=2, for any turn T, the span for a car is computed based on T - 2.\n\nFor example, for a right-moving car with τ, h, s at t_1=2, at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car on y=k, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the car is a continuous span, but positions are discrete? The span is given as intervals, so I think we consider real positions, and 0 is a point.\n\nSo if 0 is between min and max inclusive.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each turn, we need to know if it is safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut since we control the player's movement, we need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, the minimal vertical moves would be 9 steps up, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not be efficient.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9, since we need to increase y from 0 to 9, each U increases by 1, S or D doesn't help to increase, so we need at least 9 U actions. But we can have S or D, but that would increase H, so for minimal H, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, with possible S to wait if needed.\n\nBut we can also move down, but that seems counterproductive, so likely we only use U and S, not D, except possibly to retreat, but since cars are moving, and we need to go up, D might not be useful. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is in some car span.\n\nBut since the player is at x=0 always, we care about when 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nSo for each freeway y, and for each turn T, we can compute if y is unsafe at T.\n\nBut T is absolute turn number.\n\nSet t_1=2 as reference.\n\nLet Δt = T - 2, so at Δt=0, turn 2.\n\nFor freeway y=1: car with τ=-11, h=24, s=36, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span = [ -11 + 36*(T-2), 24 + 36*(T-2) ]\n\nSimilarly for y=2 and y=3, same car, so same span.\n\ny=1,2,3 all have the same car configuration: (24,-11,right,36), so for each, at time T, span is [ -11 + 36*(T-2), 24 + 36*(T-2) ]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, i.e., -11 + 36*(T-2) <= 0 <= 24 + 36*(T-2)\n\nSince s=36, the car is moving fast to the right.\n\n-11 + 36*(T-2) <= 0 and 0 <= 24 + 36*(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -11 + 36*(T-2) <= 0 => 36*(T-2) <= 11 => T-2 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so for T-2 <= 0, since T integer, T-2 =0, Δt=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 24 + 36*(T-2) always true since 24 + something >=24>0 for T>=2.\n\nNow, min <=0: -11 + 36Δt <=0 => 36Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/36 <1, so for Δt=0 only, since Δt integer.\n\nΔt=0: min = -11 +0 = -11 <=0, max=24+0=24>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor Δt=1: min = -11 +36*1 = 25? T-2=1, Δt=1.\n\nmin = -11 + 36*1 = 25? -11 +36 = 25, yes.\n\nmax = 24 + 36*1 = 60\n\nSo span [25,60], 0 not in, since 0<25.\n\nSimilarly for Δt>=1, min increases, so 0 not in span.\n\nFor Δt=0, min=-11<=0<=24, yes.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe only at Δt=0, i.e., turn T=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=2 and y=3, same, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nBut at T=2, player is at y=0, not on freeway, so for player, when on y=1,2,3, it might be later turns.\n\nFor example, if player is on y=1 at turn T>2, then since for T>2, Δt>=1, span min= -11 +36*(T-2) >= -11 +36*1=25>0 for T>=3? T=2+Δt, Δt>=1, T>=3.\n\nmin = -11 +36*Δt\n\nFor Δt=0, min=-11\n\nΔt=1, min=25\n\nΔt=2, min=61, etc., all >0 for Δt>=1.\n\nAnd max always large, but min>0 for Δt>=1, so 0 not in span for T>2.\n\nSo for freeway y=1, it is unsafe only at turn T=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=2 and y=3.\n\nNow freeway y=4: car (0,-23,right,24)\n\nhead=0, tail=-23, dir right, so τ=tail=-23, h=head=0, s=24.\n\nAt time T, span = [ τ + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2) ] = [ -23 + 24*(T-2), 0 + 24*(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<=max, i.e., -23 +24*(T-2) <=0 and 0 <= 24*(T-2)\n\nFirst, 0 <= 24*(T-2) always true for T>=2, since T-2>=0.\n\nSecond, -23 +24*(T-2) <=0 => 24*(T-2) <=23 => T-2 <= 23/24 <1, so T-2=0, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, min=-23 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nAt Δt=1, min= -23 +24*1 =1, max=0 +24=24, span [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 and y=6, same, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway y=7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4) so τ=45, h=56, s=4\n\nAt T, span = [45 +4*(T-2), 56 +4*(T-2)]\n\nSince min=45 +4Δt, at Δt=0, min=45, max=56, both >0, so 0 not in span for this car, ever, since min increases.\n\nSecond car: (20,9,right,4), τ=9, h=20, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [9 +4*(T-2), 20 +4*(T-2)]\n\nmin=9+4Δt >=9>0 for all t, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-16,-27,right,4), head=-16, tail=-27, so τ=tail=-27, h=head=-16, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [ -27 +4*(T-2), -16 +4*(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<=max, i.e., -27 +4*(T-2) <=0 and 0 <= -16 +4*(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -27 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=27 => Δt <= 27/4 = 6.75, so Δt <=6\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -16 +4Δt => 4Δt >=16 => Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 6 inclusive.\n\nThat is, at T-2=4,5,6, so T=6,7,8.\n\nCompute:\n\nAt Δt=4: min= -27 +4*4 = -27+16= -11, max= -16 +16=0? -16+4*4= -16+16=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], so min=-11<=0, max=0<=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=5: min= -27 +20= -7, max= -16+20=4, span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=6: min= -27+24= -3, max= -16+24=8, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=3: min= -27+12= -15, max= -16+12= -4, span [-15,-4], all negative, 0 not <= min? min=-15<=0 but max=-4<0, so 0 > max, not in span.\n\nAt Δt=7: min= -27+28=1, max= -16+28=12, span [1,12], 0<1, not in.\n\nSo for third car, 0 in span at T=6,7,8 (since Δt=4,5,6, T=2+4=6, 2+5=7, 2+6=8)\n\nNow, for freeway y=7, there are three cars, but only the third car can have 0 in span, at T=6,7,8.\n\nThe other cars never have 0 in span.\n\nSo y=7 is unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same cars, so also unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow for other freeways:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=2: same, unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=5: same\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nNow, at T=2, player is at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSince we start at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe take actions at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, choose a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at T if y_T between 1-8 and unsafe at T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we choose a_2, which determines y_3.\n\nAt T=3, we are at y_3, and so on.\n\nWe want to reach y_T=9 for some T.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be there any time.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nThe shortest time is 9 turns if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait or adjust.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeways y=1 to 6 are only unsafe at T=2, which has passed, so for T>2, y=1 to 6 are always safe, because no cars cover 0 after T=2.\n\ny=1: unsafe only T=2, so for T>=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4,5,6 all safe for T>=3.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo the only dangers are on y=7 and y=8 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to pass through y=8 or go directly, but since we move one step at a time, we must be on y=8 before going to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so positions: we start at y=0, then to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe can skip levels by moving multiple steps, but each action changes y by at most 1, so we must visit each integer y in between if we go up continuously.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, so we might not visit all, but to go from 0 to 9, we must reach each y from 0 to 9 at some point, but not necessarily consecutively if we move down, but since moving down increases time, for minimal time, we go up directly.\n\nIn minimal time, we should go up as much as possible, with possible stay to avoid bad times.\n\nNow, the unsafe periods: at T=6,7,8, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nThat means, if we are on y=7 or y=8 at turn 6,7, or 8, we collide.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nFor other y and times, safe.\n\nNow, we start at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, we can be at y=1 at T=3, y=2 at T=4, ..., up to y=9 at T=11? Let's compute.\n\nAt T=2, y=0\n\nAfter action a_2, at T=3, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2, but y_2=0.\n\nSet T and y_T.\n\nT=2: y=0\n\nNow, if we choose U at T=2, then at T=3, y=1\n\nIf U at T=3, at T=4, y=2\n\n...\n\nContinue, at T=3, y=1; T=4, y=2; T=5, y=3; T=6, y=4; T=7, y=5; T=8, y=6; T=9, y=7; T=10, y=8; T=11, y=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7, and T=9 is not 6,7,8; T=9 is later.\n\nT=6,7,8 are unsafe for y=7 and 8, but here at T=9, y=7, which is after, so should be safe.\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=6: y=4 (since T=2:0, T=3:1, T=4:2, T=5:3, T=6:4)\n\ny=4 at T=6.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is safe at T=6 since only unsafe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, T=7: y=5, safe.\n\nT=8: y=6, safe.\n\nT=9: y=7, but y=7 is unsafe at T=6,7,8, but T=9 is later, so safe? T=9, Δt from t1=2 is 7, for y=7, unsafe only at T=6,7,8, so T=9>8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: y=8, T=10>8, safe.\n\nT=11: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at T=11, with 9 up moves from T=2 to T=10? Actions from T=2 to T=10.\n\nActions: at T=2: U, to y=1 at T=3\n\nT=3: U, to y=2 at T=4\n\n...\n\nUp to T=10: U, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=2 to T=10, that's 9 actions: a2 to a10, and at T=11, y=11=9? T=11, y=9.\n\nT=2 to T=10 is 9 turns, actions a2 to a10.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at T=11, y=9.\n\nH=9 turns? H is number of actions, so 9 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9, since we need 9 up moves.\n\nCan we do it faster? No, because each U increases by 1, from 0 to 9, 9 steps.\n\nIf we use S, we stay, which takes extra time, so H larger.\n\nD would decrease, worse.\n\nSo minimal H should be 9.\n\nIn this case, with all U, we avoid the unsafe times because at the critical turns T=6,7,8, we are on y=4,5,6, which are safe.\n\nT=6: y=4\n\nT=7: y=5\n\nT=8: y=6\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen T=9: y=7, safe since T=9>8\n\nT=10: y=8, safe\n\nT=11: y=9, done.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nActions: from turn t_1=2 to turn 2+H-1, with H=9.\n\nSo actions at turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nAll U.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions for y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9, Δt=7.\n\nFor y=7, third car: at Δt=7, span min= -27 +4*7 = -27+28=1, max=-16+28=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=10, y=8, same.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=9, we are at y=7, but we take action at T=9 to go to y=8 at T=10.\n\nBut collision is at the position when we are on it, so at T=9, y=7, if unsafe, but here safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster? For example, if we start earlier, but we start at T=2, fixed.\n\nMinimal H=9 seems possible.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by T=10 or something.\n\nAt T=2, y=0.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nT=3: y=1\n\nT=4: y=2\n\nT=5: y=3\n\nT=6: y=4\n\nT=7: y=5\n\nT=8: y=6\n\nT=9: y=7\n\nT=10: y=8\n\nT=11: y=9\n\nTo reach at T=10, y=9, that means at T=10, we are at y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=10, we must have been at y=8 at T=9, and taken U at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, if we are at y=8, but T=9 is not unsafe for y=8? y=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8, T=9>8, safe.\n\nIn the above, at T=9, y=7, then to y=8 at T=10.\n\nCan we be at y=9 at T=10?\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=10, we need to be at y=8 at T=9, and take U at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, position y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 at T=9: T=9, Δt=7, for y=8, same as y=7, unsafe only at T=6,7,8, so T=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at T=9, we need to be at y=7 at T=8, and take U at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, if we are at y=7, T=8 is unsafe for y=7, since unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=8, y=7: unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=7 at T=8.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=8, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nIf we want to reach earlier, say at T=10, y=9.\n\nThat requires at T=9, y=8, and at T=8, y=7 or something.\n\nBut to have y=8 at T=9, we need y_{T=8} =7 or 8 or 9, but since we come from below, likely y=7 at T=8, then U to y=8 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=8, y=7: unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at T=8, but how? From below.\n\nAt T=7, if we are at y=7 or 8 or 6, etc.\n\nSuppose at T=7, y=7: but T=7, y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=7, y=6, take U to y=7 at T=8, but T=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at T=7, y=8, but y=8 at T=7 unsafe.\n\nSo, it is impossible to be on y=7 or y=8 at turns 6,7,8 without collision.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, we must not be on y=7 or y=8 during turns 6,7,8.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=4,5,6 at T=6,7,8, which are safe, and then proceed.\n\nBut we reach at T=11.\n\nCan we reach earlier by going faster? But we can only move one step per turn, so from 0 to 9, min 9 moves, 9 actions, from T=2 to T=10, reaching at T=11.\n\nT=11 is the earliest possible, since start at T=2 y=0, after k up moves, at T=2+k y=k.\n\nSet y=9, so 2+k= T, y=k=9, so T=11.\n\nSo minimal T to reach is 11, with H=9 actions.\n\nIn the path above, it works with all U.\n\nBut at T=9, we are at y=7, which is after unsafe period, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=10.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions: at each turn from t_1=2 to 10, action U.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so t=2 to 10.\n\nBut in the box, it should be listed.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAt turn T=6, we are at y=4? Let's list positions:\n\nTurn T=2: position y=0 (before any action, I think)\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nStart: turn 2, y=0\n\nAction a_2: say U, then turn 3, y=1\n\na_3: U, turn 4, y=2\n\na_4: U, turn 5, y=3\n\na_5: U, turn 6, y=4\n\nNow, at turn 6, y=4, which is freeway 4, but as we said, unsafe only at T=2, so at T=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_6: U, turn 7, y=5 (freeway 5, safe)\n\na_7: U, turn 8, y=6 (freeway 6, safe)\n\na_8: U, turn 9, y=7 (freeway 7)\n\nAt turn 9, T=9, y=7, which is after unsafe period T=6,7,8, so safe.\n\na_9: U, turn 10, y=8 (freeway 8, T=10>8, safe)\n\na_10: U, turn 11, y=9, done.\n\na_10 is the last action, to go to y=9 at T=11.\n\nH=9 actions, from t=2 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=2 to t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, action a_10=U, to reach y=9 at next turn.\n\nNow, but in the freeway y=7 at T=9, we are on it, and it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars on other rows? No, since we are not on them.\n\nAnother thing: at turn T=9, when we are on y=7, the cars on y=7: at T=9, as computed, the third car has span [1,12], not covering 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car list, for y=7, there are three cars, but only the third one matters, and it doesn't cover 0 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=10.\n\nBut let's double-check the unsafe times for y=7.\n\nEarlier: unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6: Δt=4, span min=-11, max=0? For third car: at Δt=4, min=-27+16=-11, max=-16+16=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=7: Δt=5, min=-27+20=-7, max=-16+20=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=8: Δt=6, min=-27+24=-3, max=-16+24=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=9: Δt=7, min=-27+28=1, max=-16+28=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, with 9 up moves, we can reach in 9 actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be minimal H, which is 9.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=8? That would mean reaching y=9 at T=10.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=10, we must be at y=8 at T=9 and take U at T=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=9, we must be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at T=8, but y=9 not yet, so y=7 or y=8 at T=8.\n\nIf at T=8, y=7, then take U to y=8 at T=9, but at T=8, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIf at T=8, y=8, then to be at y=8 at T=8, we need to be there from previous, but at T=8, y=8 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 at T=9 without being on y=7 or y=8 at unsafe time.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y=8 at T=9, we must have been on y=7 at T=8 or earlier, but if on y=7 at T=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we were on y=8 at T=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we skip, but we can't, since we move step by step.\n\nSuppose at T=7, we are at y=6, take U to y=7 at T=8, but T=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at T=7, we are at y=8, but how? From above, but we start from below.\n\nAt T=6, if we are at y=6, take U to y=7 at T=7, but T=7 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, any path that has y=7 or y=8 at T=6,7,8 will collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on those rows at those times.\n\nIn the direct path, we avoid by being on lower rows.\n\nTo reach earlier, impossible since min 9 moves.\n\nPerhaps we can start later or something, but no, we need to start from now.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 and y=9 are safe, we could stay at y=0 for some turns, but that increases H, worse.\n\nOr move down, but that also worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 9 with all up.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it works.\n\nBut let's list the actions for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter action at turn 10, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nWith H actions.\n\nt_1=2, so:\n\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 + 8, since t_1=2, t_1 +0=2, t_1+1=3, ..., t_1+8=10.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=9, so t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nt_1+8=2+8=10.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd actions all U.\n\nBut is there any need to change? For example, at some point, but in this case, no collision, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with H=9 but different timing, but same.\n\nBut let's confirm if at turn 6, when we are at y=4, is it safe?\n\nFreeway y=4 at T=6.\n\ny=4 has car: at t1=2, span [-23,0], but at T=6, Δt=4.\n\ns=24, right-moving.\n\nSpan: [ -23 + 24*4, 0 + 24*4 ] = [ -23 + 96, 0 + 96 ] = [73, 96], since min=-23+96=73, max=0+96=96, so [73,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nIn the sequence, all U.\n\nBut perhaps we should write it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeways 1,2,3 and 4,5,6, they have cars, but after T=2, they are far away.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8, unsafe only at T=6,7,8, which we avoid.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all up actions.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 2 to turn 10, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as it is not a freeway) at turn 2.\n- Moving up once per turn increases \\(y\\) by 1 each turn, requiring exactly 9 up moves to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) have cars that could cause collisions, but the critical unsafe periods are:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\): Unsafe only at turn 2 (which has passed), so safe for turns \\(\\geq 3\\).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\): Unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8.\n- In the sequence:\n  - At turns 6, 7, and 8, the player is at \\(y = 4\\), \\(y = 5\\), and \\(y = 6\\) respectively, all of which are safe during these turns.\n  - The player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10, both after the unsafe period (turns 6–8), so no collision occurs.\n- Any sequence with fewer than 9 actions is impossible, as 9 up moves are required to increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2 + 9 - 1 = 10\\) is all U (up).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: The player updates position at the same time as the cars move. When the player moves (at turn T), they are on the freeway corresponding to their y-coordinate at the start of the turn. Then they move to a new y (if U or D) and then at the next turn, they will be on that new y.\n\nHowever, note the collision rule: at turn T, we check the freeway y_T (the y-coordinate at the beginning of the turn) and if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T, then collision.\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from y to y+1 (for example) at turn T, then at turn T they are still on y (so they check for collision on freeway y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, they are on y+1.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=4.\n\nWe must compute the car positions at any future turn T (>=4) for each freeway.\n\nWe'll denote T = t1 + t = 4 + t, where t is the number of steps from the current turn (starting at t=0 for the current turn).\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. We start at y=2 at turn 4.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state: (turn, y) but note that the turn number can be large? However, the minimal H should be at least 7 (because we need to go from 2 to 9, which is 7 steps up without waiting) but we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? But since we are at 2 and need to go to 9, down is not helpful unless we avoid a car and then go up? However, we cannot go below 0. So we must be cautious.\n\nGiven the car states, we need to compute for each freeway and each car, the position at any turn T (>=4).\n\nLet me write down the car states at turn 4:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> this car is moving right, so at turn 4: head= -48, tail=-83? But note: the representation for right-moving is [tau, h]? Actually, the problem says:\n- Right-moving: [tau, h] -> at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). This seems odd because -48 is greater than -83? So head is -48 and tail is -83? But the problem says for right-moving: the car span is [tau, h] meaning tau <= h? But here -48 > -83? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that tau is the leftmost and h is the rightmost? But then in the example: (-48, -83) -> if tau is -83 and h is -48? Then that would be a car from -83 to -48? But the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, ...). \n\nI think there is a confusion in the notation. Let me re-read:\n\nThe update rules:\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (with tau <= h). But in the table, it's written as (head, tail, ...). \n\nIn the table for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). If we interpret the first two numbers as (head, tail) then for a right-moving car, we have head = -48 and tail = -83? But then tail < head, so the span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48]. \n\nBut the update rule for right-moving uses [tau, h] and then moves by adding s*(T-t1). So if we let tau = tail and h = head, then for right-moving: \n   initial span at t1=4: [tau, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: (48,25,right,24) -> but 25<48, so if we take tail=25, head=48? Then the span is [25,48] at t1=4.\n\nBut wait: the table says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\"? Actually, the table header says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nSo yes: for a car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nTherefore, for a right-moving car: the span is [tail, head] (if tail <= head) OR if tail>head then it would be [head, tail] but that doesn't make sense? Actually, the representation should be consistent: the head is the front of the car and tail is the rear.\n\nFor a right-moving car: the head is at the right end, and tail at the left. So the span is [tail, head]. Similarly, for left-moving: head is at the left end, tail at the right? Then the span would be [head, tail] but then head <= tail? \n\nBut the problem states:\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> meaning h is the head (leftmost) and tau is the tail (rightmost), so h <= tau? Then the update: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> so the entire car moves left.\n\nIn the given data, all cars are right-moving? Except that the representation for freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-83 -> so tail=-83, head=-48 -> so tail < head, so for a right-moving car, the span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48]. \n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: head=48, tail=25 -> so tail=25, head=48 -> span [25,48].\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> head=-48, tail=-59 -> since tail=-59 < head=-48, so span = [-59, -48]\n  car2: (28, 17, right, 4) -> head=28, tail=17 -> span=[17,28]\n  car3: (-8, -19, right, 4) -> head=-8, tail=-19 -> span=[-19,-8]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, we are only concerned with when the car spans cover 0 at the exact turn when the player is on that freeway.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if any car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe start at turn 4 at y=2. So at turn 4, we are on freeway 2? Actually, the freeways are from 1 to 8, and the player is at y=2 -> so freeway 2? But note: the grid has vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. The freeways are y=1,...,8. So when the player is at y=0,1,...,9, then if y is in [1,8] they are on a freeway.\n\nAt turn 4: y=2 -> freeway 2. We must check freeway 2 at turn 4: is there a car that covers 0?\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 4: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> so tail=-83, head=-48 -> span [-83,-48] at turn 4. Does 0 fall in [-83,-48]? No, because 0 is positive.\n\nBut we are at turn 4, so we are safe at the start.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nWe can only change by -1,0,+1 per turn.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (for k=1..8) at a turn T when any car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nWe'll compute the car positions for each freeway and each future turn.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously: for a car on freeway k, at turn T (>=4), the position is:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   span = [tau + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4)]\n\nFor a left-moving car (none in this problem): \n   span = [h - s*(T-4), tau - s*(T-4)]\n\nWe need to know for each freeway and each turn T, whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times when it is blocked (i.e., 0 is in the span of at least one car).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: right-moving, tail=-83, head=-48, speed=36.\n   At turn T: \n        left_end = -83 + 36*(T-4)\n        right_end = -48 + 36*(T-4)\n   We require: left_end <= 0 <= right_end\n        => -83 + 36*(T-4) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-4)\n\n   Solve the first inequality: -83 + 36*(T-4) <= 0\n        36*(T-4) <= 83\n        T-4 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n        T <= 4 + 2.305 = 6.305 -> so T <= 6 (since T integer)\n\n   Second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-4)\n        48 <= 36*(T-4)\n        (T-4) >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n        T >= 4 + 1.333 = 5.333 -> so T>=6\n\n   Therefore, both inequalities hold only for T=6? \n        T>=6 and T<=6 -> T=6.\n\n   Check T=6:\n        left_end = -83 + 36*(2) = -83+72 = -11\n        right_end = -48+72 = 24\n        So 0 is between -11 and 24 -> blocked at T=6.\n\n   Also, are there other T? T=5: \n        left_end = -83+36= -47\n        right_end = -48+36 = -12 -> 0 is not in [-47,-12] -> safe.\n   T=7: \n        left_end = -83+36*3 = -83+108=25\n        right_end = -48+108=60 -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\n   So freeway 1 is blocked only at turn 6.\n\nFreeway 2: same car as freeway1? \n   | 2 | (-48, -83, right, 36) | -> same as freeway1: blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3: same: blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,25,right,24) -> head=48, tail=25, so for right-moving: tail=25, head=48 -> so at turn4: [25,48]\n   At turn T: \n        left_end = 25 + 24*(T-4)\n        right_end = 48 + 24*(T-4)\n\n   Blocked when: 25+24*(T-4) <= 0 <= 48+24*(T-4)\n\n   First inequality: 25+24*(T-4) <=0 -> 24*(T-4) <= -25 -> T-4 <= -25/24 ≈ -1.04 -> impossible.\n\n   Second inequality: 0<=48+24*(T-4) -> always true for T>=4.\n\n   So no T satisfies both? Actually, the first inequality is never satisfied. Therefore, freeway4 is never blocked? \n\n   But note: the car is at [25,48] at T=4 and moves right. So it will never cover 0? Indeed, at T=4: [25,48] -> all positive. Then moves to the right. So freeway4 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway4 -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway4 -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars.\n\nCar1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> head=-48, tail=-59 -> so tail=-59, head=-48 -> span at T=4: [-59,-48]\n   At turn T: \n        left_end = -59 + 4*(T-4)\n        right_end = -48 + 4*(T-4)\n\n   Blocked when: -59+4*(T-4) <= 0 <= -48+4*(T-4)\n\n   First inequality: -59+4*(T-4) <=0 -> 4*(T-4) <=59 -> T-4<=59/4=14.75 -> T<=18 (integer)\n   Second inequality: 0<=-48+4*(T-4) -> 48<=4*(T-4) -> T-4>=12 -> T>=16.\n\n   So for T in [16,18]? Let's check:\n\n   T=16: left_end=-59+4*12=-59+48=-11, right_end=-48+48=0 -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> blocked.\n   T=17: left_end=-59+4*13=-59+52=-7, right_end=-48+52=4 -> 0 in [-7,4] -> blocked.\n   T=18: left_end=-59+4*14=-59+56=-3, right_end=-48+56=8 -> 0 in [-3,8] -> blocked.\n   T=19: left_end=-59+60=1, right_end=-48+60=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n   So freeway7 is blocked at T=16,17,18.\n\nCar2: (28,17,right,4) -> head=28, tail=17 -> span [17,28] at T=4.\n   At T: left_end=17+4*(T-4), right_end=28+4*(T-4)\n   Blocked: 17+4*(T-4)<=0<=28+4*(T-4)\n   First: 17+4*(T-4)<=0 -> 4*(T-4)<=-17 -> impossible? because T>=4 -> so never blocked.\n\nCar3: (-8,-19,right,4) -> head=-8, tail=-19 -> span [-19,-8] at T=4.\n   At T: left_end=-19+4*(T-4), right_end=-8+4*(T-4)\n   Blocked: -19+4*(T-4)<=0<=-8+4*(T-4)\n   First: -19+4*(T-4)<=0 -> 4*(T-4)<=19 -> T-4<=4.75 -> T<=8\n   Second: 0<=-8+4*(T-4) -> 8<=4*(T-4) -> T-4>=2 -> T>=6.\n\n   So T in [6,8]:\n        T=6: left_end=-19+4*2=-19+8=-11, right_end=-8+8=0 -> 0 in [-11,0] -> blocked.\n        T=7: left_end=-19+12=-7, right_end=-8+12=4 -> 0 in [-7,4] -> blocked.\n        T=8: left_end=-19+16=-3, right_end=-8+16=8 -> 0 in [-3,8] -> blocked.\n        T=9: left_end=-19+20=1, right_end=-8+20=12 -> not blocked.\n\n   So car3 blocks freeway7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, freeway7 is blocked at:\n   T=6,7,8 (from car3) and T=16,17,18 (from car1). \n\nBut note: at a given turn, if any car blocks, then the freeway is blocked.\n\nSo freeway7 is blocked at T in {6,7,8,16,17,18}.\n\nFreeway8: same cars as freeway7 -> same blocking times: T in {6,7,8,16,17,18}.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nFreeway1: blocked at T=6\nFreeway2: blocked at T=6\nFreeway3: blocked at T=6\nFreeway4: always safe\nFreeway5: always safe\nFreeway6: always safe\nFreeway7: blocked at T=6,7,8,16,17,18\nFreeway8: blocked at T=6,7,8,16,17,18\n\nWe are starting at turn4 at y=2.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T if T is in the blocked set for that freeway.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8, and we start at y=2 (freeway2) and need to get to y=9 (which is above freeway8, so not on any freeway? note: y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision check at y=9).\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn. At that turn, we are at y=9 -> not on any freeway, so no collision check. But we must have arrived at y=9 at some turn.\n\nWe can represent the state by (turn, y). The turn starts at 4 and we are at y=2.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns. We can use BFS (since the grid is small: y in [0,9] and turns might be bounded because we don't want to wait too long).\n\nBut note: we can wait arbitrarily? But we want minimal turns. Also, the blocking times are only in the near future (like 6,7,8) and then again at 16,17,18). Since we start at turn4 and we can get to 9 in 7 moves (if we go up every step: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 7 steps, so ending at turn 4+7=11). The next blocking is at turn16 which is far, so we might not need to wait that long.\n\nLet's try to go up as fast as possible:\n\nWe are at turn4: y=2 -> freeway2. Is freeway2 blocked at turn4? No (blocked only at T=6). So safe.\n\nAction at turn4: U -> then at turn5, we are at y=3.\n\nBut note: at turn4 we are on freeway2 at turn4 -> safe.\n\nAt turn5: we are at y=3 -> freeway3. Check freeway3 at turn5: blocked? freeway3 is blocked only at T=6 -> so at T=5: safe.\n\nAction at turn5: U -> turn6: y=4 -> freeway4.\n\nAt turn6: freeway4 is always safe -> so safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn6, we are on freeway4, which is safe. However, we must note that we are moving from y=3 to y=4 at turn5: \n   Turn5: we are at y=3 (freeway3) at the beginning of turn5 -> we check freeway3 at turn5: safe (only blocked at T=6). Then we move to y=4 at the end of the turn. Then at turn6, we start at y=4 -> freeway4 -> safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are not on them.\n\nNow, action at turn6: U -> turn7: y=5 -> freeway5, which is always safe.\n\nAction at turn7: U -> turn8: y=6 -> freeway6, always safe.\n\nAction at turn8: U -> turn9: y=7 -> freeway7.\n\nNow, at turn9: freeway7 is blocked? We have freeway7 blocked at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> so at T=9: safe.\n\nAction at turn9: U -> turn10: y=8 -> freeway8.\n\nAt turn10: freeway8 is blocked at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> so at T=10: safe.\n\nAction at turn10: U -> turn11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: from turn4 to turn11 -> that's 7 actions: turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nBut wait: we are at turn4: we start at y=2. Then we do 7 moves: \n   turn4: U -> y=3 at turn5\n   turn5: U -> y=4 at turn6\n   turn6: U -> y=5 at turn7\n   turn7: U -> y=6 at turn8\n   turn8: U -> y=7 at turn9\n   turn9: U -> y=8 at turn10\n   turn10: U -> y=9 at turn11.\n\nSo at turn11, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we must check for every turn we are on a freeway, we are safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n   Turn4: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (only blocked at T=6) -> safe.\n   Turn5: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (only blocked at T=6) -> safe.\n   Turn6: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n   Turn7: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n   Turn8: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n   Turn9: y=7 -> freeway7: blocked at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> T=9 is not in that set -> safe.\n   Turn10: y=8 -> freeway8: same -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence of 7 Ups works.\n\nBut is there a problem? We are going through freeway7 at turn9 and freeway8 at turn10, which are safe.\n\nHowever, note that at turn6, we are on freeway4, but freeway1,2,3 are blocked at turn6? But we are not on them. So safe.\n\nBut what if we had to be on freeway2 at turn6? Then we would be blocked. But we are at freeway4 at turn6.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns is 7.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We need to go from 2 to 9: that's 7 steps up. Without waiting, we cannot do it in less than 7 moves. So 7 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we go down? That would make the path longer, so not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\n\nBut wait: the actions are for turns starting at t1=4, then t1+1, etc. for H=7 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at turn4, and we take an action at turn4 to move to the next state.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: U -> then at turn5 we are at y=3.\nTurn 5: U -> at turn6: y=4.\nTurn 6: U -> at turn7: y=5.\nTurn 7: U -> at turn8: y=6.\nTurn 8: U -> at turn9: y=7.\nTurn 9: U -> at turn10: y=8.\nTurn 10: U -> at turn11: y=9.\n\nSo we have 7 actions: from turn4 to turn10 (inclusive) and we reach at turn11? \n\nBut the problem says: we are to provide a sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action we should be at (0,9).\n\nAt the end of the action at turn10, we are at (0,9). So that is the last turn we act.\n\nSo H=7, and the actions are for turns: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so t from 0 to H-1: that is 7 actions: t=0,1,...,6.\n\nSo:\na_{4+0} = a4 = U\na_{4+1} = a5 = U\n...\na_{4+6} = a10 = U\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait: what about the cars on freeway7 and freeway8 at turn9 and turn10? We said they are safe. But let me double-check freeway7 at turn9:\n\nFreeway7: blocked at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> turn9 is 9, which is not in this set -> safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway8 at turn10: 10 is not in {6,7,8,16,17,18} -> safe.\n\nBut note: the car3 on freeway7: at turn9: \n   car3: (-8,-19,right,4) -> at turn9: \n        T-4=5, so left_end=-19+4*5=-19+20=1, right_end=-8+20=12 -> [1,12] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, car1: at turn9: \n        left_end=-59+4*5=-59+20=-39, right_end=-48+20=-28 -> [-39,-28] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\ncar2: [17+20,28+20]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut what if we had gone faster? We start at turn4 at y=2. We cannot skip any step. So 7 moves is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could also do some S (stay) and then go? But that would take more moves. So 7 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 7 Ups.\n\nBut wait: is there any danger at turn6? We are at freeway4, which is safe. But what if we had to pass through freeway2 at turn6? Then we would be blocked. But we are at freeway4 at turn6.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut let me check the starting freeway: at turn4, we are at freeway2. We do U to go to freeway3 at turn5. Then U to freeway4 at turn6. So we skip freeway2 at turn5 and freeway3 at turn6? \n\nAt turn4: we are at freeway2 -> safe (only blocked at turn6, but we are at turn4).\nAt turn5: we are at freeway3 -> safe (blocked only at turn6, but we are at turn5).\nAt turn6: we are at freeway4 -> safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7 and the sequence is seven Ups.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nBut note: the player update: we start at turn t1=4, and we take H actions: at turn4, turn5, ... up to turn4+H-1. Then after the last action, we are at the next state. So at the turn after the last action we are at the goal? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action (which is at the beginning of turn t1+H) we are at the goal? \n\nBut the update rule: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nIn our case: H=7, so we are at turn4+7=11? But we said after the action at turn10 (which is 4+6) we are at y=9 at turn11? \n\nActually, let's index:\n\nTurn4: start at y2. Then we do a4: U -> at turn5: y3.\n...\nTurn10: a10: U -> at turn11: y9.\n\nSo the state at turn11 is (0,9). We have taken 7 actions: from turn4 to turn10.\n\nSo the sequence is for turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut note: the example of the answer format: it starts at t1 and then t1+1, ... until the last action at t1+H-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut wait: what if we try to go faster? We cannot. We must move 7 steps up.\n\nBut what if we go down at some point to avoid a block and then go up? That would take more turns. So no.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at some safe freeway to avoid a block. But in our case, we don't encounter any block in the path. So no need.\n\nBut let me check if there is a block at freeway7 at turn9? We already did: no.\n\nOne more thing: the freeway4,5,6 are always safe? Yes, as computed.\n\nBut note: freeway7 and 8 are safe at turn9 and 10? Yes.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 4 in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and any car on that freeway has a span that includes the x-coordinate 0 at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Blocking Times:\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3**: Blocked only at turn 6 (cars cover x=0).\n- **Freeways 4, 5, 6**: Always safe (cars never cover x=0).\n- **Freeways 7, 8**: Blocked at turns 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18 (cars cover x=0 at these turns).\n\n### Path to Goal:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2) at turn 4.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must move upward 7 times (since \\(9 - 2 = 7\\)).\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7, as moving downward or staying would increase \\(H\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 4**: Player at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). Freeway 2 is safe at turn 4 (blocked only at turn 6). Action: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5.\n- **Turn 5**: Player at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Freeway 3 is safe at turn 5 (blocked only at turn 6).

Action: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n- **Turn 7**: Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is always safe. Action: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n- **Turn 8**: Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is always safe. Action: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9**: Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is safe at turn 9 (blocked at 6,7,8,16,17,18; turn 9 not blocked). Action: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10**: Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is safe at turn 10 (blocked at 6,7,8,16,17,18; turn 10 not blocked). Action: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, the player reaches (0, 9). The sequence of 7 actions (all \\(U\\)) ensures no collisions and achieves the goal in minimal turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are applied from turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 7 - 1 = 10\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 5. I'll use t to represent the turn number starting from t1=5.\n\nThe player's y-position changes based on actions: U (up, +1), D (down, -1), S (stay, 0). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on each freeway, and collision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y-position, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you're only considered on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on freeway y_T at that exact turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top row, and since y=9 has no cars (freeways are y=1 to 8), once we're on y=9, we're safe. But we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway with cars, so no collision possible there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we start at y=3 and need to get to y=9.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t1=5.\n\nFor each freeway k (y=k), there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. Based on the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so head increases.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nDirection is right, so it's right-moving. Since right-moving, the span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) is [τ, h], which might be confusing because τ is tail, h is head, but in the span, it's [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h since it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] with h > τ.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so span is [tail, head].\n\nFor left-moving, it's [head, tail] but head is left, tail is right? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nTypically, head is the front, so for left-moving, head is on the left, tail on the right.\n\nBut in the span notation, [h, τ] with h > τ for left-moving? The problem says:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSince it's moving left, both decrease, so if at t1, h is larger than τ? For example, if h = 10, τ = 5, then [10,5]? But that would be from 10 to 5, which is decreasing, but usually we write intervals with min to max.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nBut [h, τ] could have h > τ or h < τ? The problem doesn't specify which is larger.\n\nFrom the example, let's take freeway 7: (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-55, -44]? τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so if moving right, tail < head, so span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so head < tail, span is [head, tail].\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, head > tail, since head is right.\n\nFor left-moving, head < tail, since head is left.\n\nLet's confirm with the values.\n\nFreeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nhead = -12, tail = -47, since right-moving, tail should be less than head? -47 < -12, yes, so tail = -47, head = -12, so span at t1 is [ -47, -12 ] for right-moving? But the problem says for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-47, -12].\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 36(T-5), -12 + 36(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be Span(t1) = [h, τ] with h < τ? But in the data, all seem to have head and tail such that for right, head > tail, and for left, it might be different, but in this case, all cars are right-moving except... let's see the directions.\n\nAll cars in the list have direction \"right\", no left-moving? Freeway 7 has three cars, all right, freeway 8 same, and others all right.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: all (-12,-47,right,36) so same for all.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: (72,49,right,24) but 72 and 49, 49<72, so tail=49, head=72? But in the tuple it's (head,tail) so (72,49), head=72, tail=49, direction right, so tail=49, head=72, span at t1: [49,72] for right-moving? But the problem says for right-moving Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [49,72].\n\nBut in the list, for freeway 4, it's (72,49,right,24), so head=72, tail=49, so τ=49, h=72.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (-44,-55,right,4), head=-44, tail=-55, since -55 < -44, so τ=-55, h=-44, span at t1: [-55,-44]? And direction right.\n\nAlso (32,21,right,4), head=32, tail=21, 21<32, τ=21, h=32.\n\nAnd (-4,-15,right,4), head=-4, tail=-15, -15<-4, τ=-15, h=-4.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, so I need to consider all of them for collision.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nSpan at time T for a car on freeway k at time T.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we check at integer turns.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t=5, y=3.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, so from t=5 to t=5+H-1, we have H actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is from t=5 to t=5+H-1, so H actions, and at turn (5+H-1), we have y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn 5+H, with y_{5+H} =9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are on y_t, and we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, no collision, but we need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe actions are taken from t=5 onwards, so for turns t=5,6,7,... up to when we reach y=9.\n\nLet T be the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nThen H is the number of turns from start to T, so if we start at t=5, reach at t=T, then H = T - 4? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 5, we are at y=3.\n\nAfter 0 actions, we are still at turn 5, not moved.\n\nAfter first action a_5, at turn 6, we are at y_6.\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T >=5.\n\nIf at turn 5, y=3, which is not 9, so we need to take actions.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after that, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with a_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAlso, at each intermediate turn, for τ from t1 to t1+H-1, we need no collision at turn τ, meaning when at y_τ, no car on that freeway has 0 in span at time τ.\n\nAt turn t1+H, we are at y=9, no cars, so no collision check needed or it's safe.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and collision is only on freeways y=1-8, so at y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, since we start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, we need to increase y by 6. Each U action increases by 1, D decreases, S stays. So minimally, we need at least 6 U actions, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so probably we should go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to know for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, for the freeway the player is on.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, the collision depends on the x=0 position at the turn when the player is on that row.\n\nFor each freeway k (y=k), and for each turn t, I can compute if at time t, there is a car on freeway k with 0 in its span.\n\nThen, when the player is on row y at turn t, if for that (y,t), there is a car, collision, else safe.\n\nBut y is the freeway number.\n\nIn this case, freeways are fixed, y=1 to 8, each with its own cars.\n\nNow, for a given freeway k and time t (from t1=5), I can compute the span of each car at time t and see if 0 is covered.\n\nt is absolute turn number.\n\nLet t1 = 5.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and their span at time t.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one, (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nDirection right, so at time t, span: [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] with τ = tail = -47, h = head = -12, s=36, t1=5.\n\nSo Span(t) = [-47 + 36(t-5), -12 + 36(t-5)]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -47 + 36(t-5) <= 0 <= -12 + 36(t-5)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut let's compute for each t when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1:\n\nSet L(t) = -47 + 36(t-5)\n\nU(t) = -12 + 36(t-5)\n\n0 in [L(t), U(t)] if L(t) <= 0 <= U(t)\n\nSince L(t) <= U(t) always.\n\nL(t) <= 0 <= U(t)\n\nNow, L(t) = -47 + 36(t-5) <= 0 ⇒ 36(t-5) <= 47 ⇒ t-5 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305 ⇒ t <= 6.305, so t <= 6 since t integer.\n\nt-5 <= 47/36 = 47÷36≈1.305, so t-5 <=1 since t integer? t-5 <=1.305, so for t-5=0,1\n\nSimilarly, U(t) = -12 + 36(t-5) >=0 ⇒ 36(t-5) >=12 ⇒ t-5 >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333, so t-5 >=1 since t integer? t-5 >=0.333, so t-5 >=1 for integer t? Let's list:\n\nFor t=5: t-5=0, L(5) = -47 +0 = -47, U(5)= -12, so [-47,-12], 0 not in, since -12 <0? -12 <0, so 0 not <= U(5), U(5)=-12<0, so 0 > U(5), not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, L(5)= -47 <=0, but U(5)= -12 <0, so 0 not in [ -47, -12] because both negative.\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <=0 and U >=0.\n\nHere L=-47<=0, but U=-12<0, so U<0, not >=0, so 0 not in.\n\nt=6: t-5=1, L(6)= -47 +36(1) = -47+36= -11, U(6)= -12 +36=24\n\nSo [ -11, 24], -11 <=0 <=24, yes, 0 in.\n\nt=7: t-5=2, L(7)= -47+72=25, U(7)= -12+72=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nt=8: even larger, not.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at t=6 only.\n\nAt t=5: not, t=6: yes, t=7: no, etc.\n\nt=6 is the only time when 0 is covered for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, cars: (-12,-47,right,36), identical, so same as above, collision only at t=6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, collision only at t=6.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4, cars: (72,49,right,24)\n\nhead=72, tail=49, direction right, s=24.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)] = [49 + 24(t-5), 72 + 24(t-5)]\n\nL(t) = 49 + 24(t-5)\n\nU(t) = 72 + 24(t-5)\n\n0 in span if L(t) <=0 <= U(t)\n\nBut L(t) =49 +24(t-5) >=49 >0 for t>=5, since t-5>=0, L(t)>=49>0, so L(t)>0 always, U(t)>L(t)>0, so 0 never <= U(t) since U(t)>0? 0 <= U(t) is true since U(t)>0, but L(t) <=0? L(t) >=49>0 for all t, so L(t) >0, thus 0 < L(t) <= U(t), so 0 not in [L,U] because L>0.\n\nFor example t=5: L=49, U=72, [49,72], 0 not in.\n\nt=6: [49+24=73, 72+24=96], etc, all positive, so 0 never covered for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same cars, so no collision ever.\n\nFreeway 6: same, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, has three cars: (-44,-55,right,4), (32,21,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, so for each, compute span at time t.\n\nFirst car: head=-44, tail=-55, s=4\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-5), h + s(t-5)] = [-55 +4(t-5), -44 +4(t-5)]\n\nSecond car: head=32, tail=21, s=4, span: [21 +4(t-5), 32 +4(t-5)]\n\nThird car: head=-4, tail=-15, s=4, span: [-15 +4(t-5), -4 +4(t-5)]\n\nNow, collision if for any of these, 0 is in the span at time t.\n\nSo let's compute for each t from 5 onwards.\n\nt=5:\n\nFirst car: [-55 +0, -44 +0] = [-55,-44], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [21+0,32+0]=[21,32], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-15+0,-4+0]=[-15,-4], 0 not in (since -4<0).\n\nt=6:\n\nFirst car: [-55 +4(1) = -51, -44 +4= -40], [-51,-40], both <0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [21+4=25, 32+4=36], [25,36], >0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-15+4= -11, -4+4=0], [-11,0], now L=-11<=0, U=0>=0, so 0 is included, since 0<=0 and 0>=0.\n\nU=0, so 0 <= U, and L<=0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0].\n\nSo at t=6, for third car, 0 in span.\n\nThus collision on freeway 7 at t=6.\n\nt=7:\n\nFirst car: [-55 +4(2)= -55+8= -47, -44+8= -36], [-47,-36], <0, no\n\nSecond car: [21+8=29,32+8=40], [29,40], >0, no\n\nThird car: [-15+8= -7, -4+8=4], [-7,4], L=-7<=0, U=4>=0, so 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nt=8:\n\nFirst car: [-55+12= -43, -44+12= -32], [-43,-32], no\n\nSecond car: [21+12=33,32+12=44]? 21+12=33, 32+12=44, [33,44], no\n\nThird car: [-15+12= -3, -4+12=8], [-3,8], 0 in, yes.\n\nt=9:\n\nFirst car: [-55+16= -39, -44+16= -28], no\n\nSecond car: [21+16=37,32+16=48], no\n\nThird car: [-15+16=1, -4+16=12], [1,12], now L=1>0, U>0, so 0 not in since 0<1.\n\nSo for third car, at t=9, L=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, t=10: even larger.\n\nNow first car: when does it cover 0?\n\nL(t) = -55 +4(t-5) <=0 ⇒ 4(t-5) <=55 ⇒ t-5 <=55/4=13.75, so t<=18.75\n\nU(t) = -44 +4(t-5) >=0 ⇒ 4(t-5) >=44 ⇒ t-5 >=11, t>=16\n\nSo for t from 16 to 18, first car covers 0? Let's see.\n\nU(t) >=0 when t-5 >=11, t>=16\n\nL(t) <=0 when t-5 <=13.75, t<=18 since t integer, t-5<=13, t<=18? t-5 <=13.75, so t<=18 for L<=0.\n\nt-5=13: L= -55+52= -3? 4*13=52, L= -55+52= -3 <=0, U= -44+52=8>=0\n\nt-5=14: L= -55+56=1>0, U= -44+56=12>0, L>0 so not.\n\nSo first car: 0 in span for t-5 from 11 to 13? U>=0 when t-5>=11, L<=0 when t-5<=13.\n\nt-5=11: U= -44+44=0>=0, L= -55+44= -11<=0, so yes\n\nt-5=12: U= -44+48=4>=0, L= -55+48= -7<=0, yes\n\nt-5=13: U= -44+52=8>=0, L= -55+52= -3<=0, yes\n\nt-5=14: L= -55+56=1>0, not\n\nSo t=16,17,18\n\nSimilarly, second car: L(t)=21 +4(t-5) >=21>0, always, so never covers 0.\n\nThird car: as above, 0 in span for t-5 from 1 to 3? Earlier: t=6,7,8\n\nt=6: t-5=1, [-11,0] or [-11,0]? At t=6: [-15+4= -11, -4+4=0], so [ -11,0]\n\nt=7: [-7,4]\n\nt=8: [-3,8]\n\nt=9: [1,12] not\n\nSo freeway 7 has collision at t=6,7,8 from third car, and also at t=16,17,18 from first car, but t=16 is far, we might not care if we can reach fast.\n\nBut for now, near future.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8, same cars as freeway 7: (-44,-55,right,4), (32,21,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4)\n\nIdentical to freeway 7, so same collision times: at t=6,7,8, and later t=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 2 and 3 same as 1, but y=2 and y=3.\n\nFreeway 2 is y=2, which has cars same as y=1, collision at t=6.\n\nSimilarly y=3 collision at t=6.\n\nNow let's summarize for each freeway and each turn t, if it has collision (i.e., if 0 is covered by some car).\n\nt starts from 5.\n\ny=1: collision only at t=6\n\ny=2: same, only t=6\n\ny=3: same, only t=6\n\ny=4: no collision ever\n\ny=5: no collision ever\n\ny=6: no collision ever\n\ny=7: collision at t=6,7,8\n\ny=8: collision at t=6,7,8\n\ny=0 and y=9 no freeway, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=5, y=3.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, which has collision? For y=3, collision at t=6, but at t=5?\n\nFor y=3, freeway 3, at t=5: we computed, for freeway 3, same as y=1, at t=5 no collision, since [ -47,-12] not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y=3 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nMinimal actions: since we need +6 in y, at least 6 up actions.\n\nBut we might need to avoid rows at certain times.\n\nNow, let's list for each turn, which rows are safe.\n\nSince the player moves, we need to plan the path.\n\nStart at t=5, y=3. Safe, since no collision at t=5 for y=3.\n\nNow, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=4 at next turn.\n\nBut at turn t, we choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t, and we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are on y_{t+1}, and check collision for that turn.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, we should go up when possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row when it has collision.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times:\n\nFor y=1,2,3: unsafe only at t=6\n\ny=4,5,6: always safe, no cars or no coverage.\n\ny=4,5,6 have no collision ever, as computed.\n\ny=4: no, y=5: no, y=6: no.\n\ny=7 and 8: unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\nNow, at t=5: we are at y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=4,5,6 are always safe, we can stay there or move through.\n\ny=7 and 8 are unsafe from t=6 to t=8.\n\nt=6,7,8 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nAfter t=8, y=7 and 8 might be safe, depending.\n\nFor y=7 and 8, after t=8, at t=9, we saw for third car, not covered, and first car later, but we can reach before t=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9, we need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=4,5,6 safe always.\n\ny=7 and 8 only unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at t=5, we are at y=3.\n\nIf we go up at t=5, action U, then at t=6, we are at y=4.\n\ny=4 is always safe, so at t=6, y=4, no collision.\n\nThen we can go up again at t=6, to y=5 at t=7.\n\ny=5 safe.\n\nAt t=7, go up to y=6 at t=8.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we are at y=6.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=7, but at t=8, y=7 is unsafe? At t=8, for y=7, collision, as per above.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=8.\n\nIf we go up from y=6 at t=8, to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=7.\n\nNow, for y=7 at t=9: earlier, for freeway 7, at t=9, third car span [1,12], L=1>0, so 0 not in, safe. First car not yet, so y=7 safe at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=9: same as y=7, since identical cars, at t=9, third car [1,12] not cover 0, so safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=8 at t=9? Let's sequence.\n\nStart: t=5, y=3\n\nAction at t=5: if U, then y_6 = y_5 +1 =4\n\nAt t=6, position y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen action at t=6: U, then y_7 =5\n\nAt t=7, y=5, safe.\n\nAction at t=7: U, then y_8 =6\n\nAt t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nNow action at t=8: if U, then y_9 =7\n\nAt t=9, position y=7, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen action at t=9: U, then y_10=8\n\nAt t=10, position y=8.\n\nNow y=8 at t=10: freeway 8, at t=10, t-5=5, first car: [-55+20= -35, -44+20= -24]? span: L(t)= -55 +4(t-5), t=10, t-5=5, L= -55+20= -35, U= -44+20= -24? U= h + s(t-t1) = -44 +4(5) = -44+20= -24, so [ -35, -24] <0, no\n\nSecond car: [21+20=41,32+20=52], no\n\nThird car: [-15+20=5, -4+20=16], [5,16]>0, no\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen action at t=10: U, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, y=9, safe, reached.\n\nBut we reached at t=11, with y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=5 to t=11, that's 6 turns later? Let's see actions.\n\nActions: at t=5,6,7,8,9,10: all U, so 6 actions.\n\nStarted at y=3, after 6 U, y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, y=9.\n\nNow, did we avoid collisions?\n\nAt t=5: y=3, safe\n\nt=6: y=4, safe\n\nt=7: y=5, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, safe (as above)\n\nt=10: y=8, safe (as above)\n\nt=11: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is there a faster way? Minimal H.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, starting from y=3, difference 6, so at least 6 up actions, so minimal H=6 actions, reaching at turn t=5+6=11.\n\nt=5 start, after first action at t=5, to t=6 y=4, ..., after sixth action at t=10, to t=11 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used all U, and it worked.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, but in this path, we were on y=7 at t=9, which is after t=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no need to go down or anything.\n\nBut let's confirm if at t=6, if we were on y=7, it would be unsafe, but we were on y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIs there a way with H<6? No, because we need to increase y by 6, each U only +1, so minimum 6 actions.\n\nThus H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have actions from t=5 to t=10.\n\nt=5 to t=10, that's 6 actions: a5 to a10.\n\nThen at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t1=5.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=5.\n\nSo actions: at turn 5: U, turn 6: U, turn 7: U, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nThen after that, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + 0} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nHere t1=5, H=6, so actions a5 to a10, y11=9.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn 5: a5, Turn 6: a6, ..., Turn 10: a10.\n\nBut in the format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1 + H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nHere H-1=5, so up to turn 10.\n\nAnd each action U.\n\nBut is this correct? At turn 8, we are at y=6, and go to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at turn 8, position y=6, which is safe.\n\nCould we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up faster, but we start at y=3, need to go to y=9, 6 steps, no faster.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 3.\n\nPerhaps at t=5, we stay or something, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nOr go down, but that increases H, so not minimal.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 3, at t=6, it is unsafe, but in our path, at t=6 we are on y=4, not on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly, but with S actions, but that would delay.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nThe player position: t=5: y=3\n\na5=U, t=6: y=4\n\na6=U, t=7: y=5\n\na7=U, t=8: y=6\n\na8=U, t=9: y=7\n\na9=U, t=10: y=8\n\na10=U, t=11: y=9\n\nAll safe as above.\n\nIn the action, at turn t, we are on y_t, and after action, to y_{t+1}.\n\nIn collision check, at each turn, for the position at that turn.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, safe; not on y=1,2,3 which have collision but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, at t=6,7,8 unsafe, but we are on y=7 at t=9, which is safe.\n\nt=9>8.\n\nNow, but in the car for freeway 7, third car at t=6: span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nBut at t=9, [1,12], not include.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for each turn starting from t1=5.\n\nH=6, so turns from 5 to 10.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial position.\n\nCurrent turn t1=5, position (0,3).\n\nAfter actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 10? How?\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nIf at turn t=5, y=3.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay, y=3, but not 9.\n\nTo reach at turn T, with y_T=9.\n\nEarliest possible: if all U, from y=3 at t=5, after first U at t=5, y6=4; ... at t=10, y=9? Let's see:\n\nt=5: y=3\n\na5=U: y6=4\n\na6=U: y7=5\n\na7=U: y8=6\n\na8=U: y9=7\n\na9=U: y10=8\n\na10=U: y11=9\n\nSo at turn 11, y=9.\n\nCan we be at y=9 at turn 10?\n\nAt turn 10, y10=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, y10 is set by action at t=9.\n\ny10 = y9 + a9\n\nIf y10=9, and y9 <=8, so a9 must be U if y9=8, or if y9=9, but we start from lower.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need y9=8 and a9=U.\n\ny9=8 at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, y9 is set by action at t=8: y9 = y8 + a8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=5, to y=9 at t=10, that would require increasing by 6 in 5 steps? From t=5 to t=10, that's 5 turns later, but positions: at t=5, y=3; after actions at t=5,6,7,8,9, we have y at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAfter k actions, we have y_{t1 + k}\n\nTo have y_{t1 + k} =9.\n\nt1=5, y5=3.\n\ny6 = y5 + a5\n\ny7 = y6 + a6 = y5 + a5 + a6\n\n...\n\ny_{5+m} = y5 + sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_{5+i} for i from 0 to m-1.\n\ny_{5+m} = 3 + sum_{t=5}^{5+m-1} Δy_t\n\nTo have y_{5+m} =9, so 3 + sum =9, sum Δy =6.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so at least 6 steps, so m >=6, thus y_{5+6} = y11=9 is earliest.\n\nIf some Δy=0, it takes more actions.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is all U for t=5 to t=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=5 to t=10.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at t=9, which is safe.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn our case, it doesn't apply, since we only care about the row we are on at each turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, we are on y_T, check cars on that row.\n\nWhen we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, then action changes y for T+1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIn this path, we never on y=7 or 8 at t=6,7,8, so safe.\n\nThus minimal H=6 with all U actions.\n\nBut the car states for freeway 1,2,3 at t=6 unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 5: U\\\\ Turn 6: U\\\\ Turn 7: U\\\\ Turn 8: U\\\\ Turn 9: U\\\\ Turn 10: U }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nSince t1=5, and H=6, so actions from t=5 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, it's for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify H, but in the answer, it's the sequence, and H is minimal.\n\nIn the box, only the sequence.\n\nThe format says: Turn t_1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to go to y=4 at t=6, but we did.\n\nIf we stay at t=5, S, then at t=6, still y=3, but y=3 at t=6 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=3 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, to y=2 at t=6, but y=2 at t=6 also unsafe.\n\nSo only choice is to go up to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen similarly, we can go up all the way.\n\nAt t=8, we are at y=6, if we go to y=7 at t=9, as we did.\n\nIf we go earlier, but we cannot, because at t=8, if we go to y=7 immediately, but at t=8, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at t=8.\n\nIn our action, at t=8, we are on y=6, and we go to y=7 at t=9, so at t=9, y=7, which is safe.\n\nIf we had arrived earlier, but we started late.\n\nAnother path: suppose at t=5, we go up to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, we could go down or stay, but that would delay, not minimal.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nThus the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn 5 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\n- **Freeways y=1, y=2, y=3**: Each has a car with initial span \\([-47, -12]\\) at turn 5, moving right at speed 36. Collision occurs only at turn 6, where the span is \\([-11, 24]\\), containing 0. Safe at all other turns.\n- **Freeways y=4, y=5, y=6**: Each has a car with initial span \\([49, 72]\\) at turn 5, moving right at speed 24. Since the span is always positive, 0 is never in the span. No collision at any turn.\n- **Freeway y=7**: Has three cars:\n  - Car 1: Initial span \\([-55, -44]\\), moving right at speed 4. Collision at turns 16-18 (not relevant for minimal path).\n  - Car 2: Initial span \\([21, 32]\\), moving right at speed 4. Always positive, no collision.\n  - Car 3: Initial span \\([-15, -4]\\), moving right at speed 4. Collision at turns 6, 7, 8, where spans are \\([-11, 0]\\), \\([-7, 4]\\), and \\([-3, 8]\\) respectively, all containing 0. Safe at turn 9 and beyond.\n- **Freeway y=8**: Identical to y=7, with collision at turns 6, 7, 8, and safe at turn 9 and beyond.\n\n### Safe Path to Minimize Turns\n- The player must increase y from 3 to 9, a difference of 6. Each \"U\" action increases y by 1, so at least 6 turns are required.\n- At turn 5, the player is at y=3 (safe, as no collision at turn 5 for y=3).\n- To avoid collision on y=1, y=2, y=3 at turn 6, the player must not be on these rows at turn 6. The only safe action is \"U\" to move to y=4 at turn 6.\n- y=4, y=5, y=6 are always safe, so \"U\" actions can be used consecutively:\n  - Turn 6: At y=4 (safe), action \"U\" to y=5 at turn 7.\n  - Turn 7: At y=5 (safe), action \"U\" to y=6 at turn 8.\n  - Turn 8: At y=6 (safe), action \"U\" to y=7 at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, y=7 is safe (no collision, as span for y=7 at turn 9 is \\([1, 12]\\) for the relevant car, not containing 0). Action \"U\" to y=8 at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, y=8 is safe (no collision, as span for y=8 at turn 10 is \\([5, 16]\\) for the relevant car, not containing 0). Action \"U\" to y=9 at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, y=9 is reached (no cars, safe).\n\nThis path uses 6 actions (H=6) and reaches y=9 at turn 11. No shorter path is possible, as 6 \"U\" actions are required to increase y by 6.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 5: U (move to y=4 at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: U (move to y=5 at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: U (move to y=6 at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: U (move to y=7 at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move to y=8 at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move to y=9 at turn 11)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). Note that y must be in [0,9]. We start at y=0 and want to reach y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T) and then moves to y' for the next turn. Therefore, when we are at turn T and we are at position (0, y_T), we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T. If we move to a new freeway at the next turn, we will not be on that new freeway until turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=8. We need to compute the car spans at future turns T (>=8) for each freeway.\n\nNote: The car update rules:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire span shifts left by s*(T-t1). But note: the representation for left-moving is given as (head, tail) and then the update: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the table gives for each car: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nBut looking at the table, all cars in this problem are right-moving. For example, freeway 7 and 8 have three cars each with direction 'right'. The others are also right.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the update is:\n  At turn t1: span is [tau, h] (because head is at the right end) -> but note the table gives (head, tail) and then for right-moving, the update is: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, the problem states for right-moving: \n  \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail). Let me check the example for freeway 7: \n  It has three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor the first car: at t1=8, the span is [37, 48]? But the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, head]. So for (48,37): tau=37, head=48 -> [37,48]. Then at time T, it becomes [37 + 4*(T-8), 48 + 4*(T-8)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1) -> [1,12] at t1=8, then [1+4*(T-8), 12+4*(T-8)].\nThird car: (-24,-35) -> [-35,-24] at t1=8, then [-35+4*(T-8), -24+4*(T-8)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which is the y-coordinate) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn T (starting from 8). We need to plan a sequence of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 (at turn 8). We cannot collide at y=0 because the freeways are from 1 to 8. So we are safe at y=0.\n\nWe need to move up to y=9. Since we can only change by at most 1 per turn, the minimal number of turns is 9 (if we go straight up: 9 moves of U). But we have to avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe must check for each freeway at the time we are on that freeway whether there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nLet me denote T0 = 8. We are at turn T0=8 at position (0,0). We are going to simulate turns T=8,9,10,... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe have to choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) so that we end at (0,9). Since we start at 0 and must go to 9, the minimal H is 9 if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut we have to check for each freeway we step on: at the turn when we are on that freeway, is there a car that covers x=0?\n\nNote: We are only on one freeway per turn. When we are at turn T, we are at y_T. We check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nLet's compute the positions of the cars at arbitrary turn T (>=8) for each freeway.\n\nWe'll denote T_rel = T - 8 (relative turn from the current turn 8).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> at T_rel = T-8, the span is:\n  [tau + s*(T-8), head + s*(T-8)] = [-83 + 36*(T-8), -48 + 36*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [-83+36*(T-8), -48+36*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [-83+36*(T-8), -48+36*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> [-71+24*(T-8), -48+24*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4: [-71+24*(T-8), -48+24*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 6: same: [-71+24*(T-8), -48+24*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,4) -> [37+4*(T-8), 48+4*(T-8)]\n  Car2: (12,1,right,4) -> [1+4*(T-8), 12+4*(T-8)]\n  Car3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> [-35+4*(T-8), -24+4*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: three cars with the same spans.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving. We start at turn 8 at y=0. Then we choose an action for turn 8, which will lead to y9 at turn 9, and so on.\n\nWe want the minimal H. So we try to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the freeways when there is a car at x=0.\n\nLet me check for each freeway and for each relative turn (starting from T_rel=0, i.e., T=8) when the car spans cover 0.\n\nBut note: we might not step on a freeway at the same time as when the car is at 0. We step on a freeway at a specific turn.\n\nWe are going to step on freeway y at a specific turn T. We must avoid T such that for freeway y, at turn T, 0 is in one of the car spans on that freeway.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and for each T (starting from T=8) whether there is a car covering 0.\n\nBut T can be large? However, we are only going to consider T until we reach 9. Since we can only move 1 per turn, we are going to consider T from 8 to at most 8+ (some turns). The minimal H is 9, so T from 8 to 16 (if we go straight up: at turn 8: y=0, turn 9: y=1, ..., turn 16: y=8, then turn 17: y=9? Actually, we need to be at y=9 at the last turn. So if we start at turn 8 at y=0, then:\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. The turns are t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. We start at turn t1 (8) at y=0, then we take H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (relative to t1). So:\n\nAt time t1 (T=8): we are at (0,0). Then we take action a_{t1} (for turn 8) and then at turn 9 we are at y1 = y0 + Δy0, and so on until at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and we are at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn) at position (0,9). The minimal H is 9: we need to go from 0 to 9, which requires 9 moves up. So the minimal H is 9, meaning we do 9 actions: U every time. Then we would be at:\n\nTurn 8: start at 0\nTurn 9: y=1 (after first U)\nTurn 10: y=2\n...\nTurn 16: y=8\nTurn 17: y=9 -> so at turn 17 we are at y=9. Therefore, H=9? But note: the last action is taken at turn 16 (which is t1+8) and then at turn 17 (t1+9) we are at y=9. But the problem says: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (relative to t1). So:\n\nWe have actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at the next state. But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWait: the player update: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t1 (8), we are at y_{t1}=0. Then we choose a_{t1}. Then at turn t1+1 (9), we are at y_{t1+1} = 0 + Δy_{t1}. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. We require that y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nTherefore, the last action is taken at turn t1+H-2, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns from the start (turn t1) until the turn we are at 9. How many turns? We start at 0 at turn t1, and we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So we have H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1? But the problem says: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H (but we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1). \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nAt turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=0. Then we choose a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}. \n\nThen at turn t1+1: we choose a_{t1+1}, and then at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAt turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H-1}. We require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nBut how did we get to y_{t1+H-1}? It is the result of the action at turn t1+H-2. The action at turn t1+H-1 is not taken until after we have already achieved y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nActually, the requirement is that at the turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. So we must have achieved 9 by the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or at the end of the turn? \n\nThe problem states: \"at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)\". And the update rule: at turn t, we choose a_t and then we move to y_{t+1} at the next turn. \n\nBut note: the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are at a freeway. And at turn t, we are at y_t and then we choose a_t to move to y_{t+1}. So the state at turn t is (0, y_t). \n\nTherefore, we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). This means that we must have arrived at 9 by the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Actually, the state at the start of the turn is (0, y_t). And then we choose an action for that turn? But the problem doesn't require an action after we are at 9? \n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (relative to t1) meaning actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1. But if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? However, the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut note: the action at turn t1+H-1 would then move us to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy_{t1+H-1}. But we don't want that. We want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nTherefore, we must have already been at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or we get to 9 by the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\nLet me reexamine:\n\n- At turn t: we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, which moves us to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn t, we must have y_t = 9.\n\nTherefore, we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nHow did we get to 9? We got to 9 by the action at turn t1+H-2. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we still have to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the problem requires that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. We are, so that's fine. But then we take an action at that turn? And then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy. But we don't care about what happens after we have achieved 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions, and at the end of these H actions, we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut note: after taking the last action (the H-th action) at turn t1+H-1, we move to the next state at turn t1+H. But we don't require anything about turn t1+H. We only require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nWait, that is inconsistent because the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the start of the turn. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we go to turn t1+H. \n\nTo be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, we must have reached 9 by the action at turn t1+H-2. \n\nSo the sequence of actions for H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1) will result in the state at turn t1+H being 9 + ... but we don't care. \n\nBut the problem says: we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nThis means that the last action (at turn t1+H-2) must have moved us to 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at 9. Then after that action, we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy. \n\nBut we don't care about that. \n\nHowever, note that when we are at 9, we are safe because the freeways are 1-8. So we can be at 9 and take any action? \n\nBut the problem only requires that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo the minimal number of actions H: we start at 0 at turn t1. We need to get to 9. The minimal number of moves is 9 moves of U. Then:\n\nWe take 9 actions: \n  At turn t1: U -> turn t1+1: y=1\n  ...\n  At turn t1+8: U -> turn t1+9: y=9\n\nThen at turn t1+9, we are at y=9. But we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. Therefore, we set H-1 = 9? Then H=10? \n\nBut wait: \n  Turn t1 (8): we are at 0 -> we take action a_{t1} (first action) and then at turn 9 (t1+1) we are at 1.\n  ...\n  At turn t1+8 (16): we are at 8 -> we take action a_{t1+8} (the 9th action) and then at turn t1+9 (17) we are at 9.\n\nBut we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So we want at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. That happens at turn 17. Therefore, t1+H-1 = 17 -> 8 + H - 1 = 17 -> H = 10.\n\nSo we need 10 actions? But then we are at 9 at turn 17 (t1+9). \n\nAlternatively, if we can get to 9 in fewer turns? But we can only move one step per turn. The minimal number of moves is 9, so the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 8 at y=0. We want to be at y=9 at some turn T. The earliest T is 17 (if we move up every turn). So H (the number of actions) is 9? But the problem says the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nWe are at 9 at turn T = t1 + 9 = 17. And the last action we took was at turn 16 (t1+8). So the sequence of actions is from t1 (8) to t1+8 (16) -> that's 9 actions. So H = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So if H=9, then t=0 to 8: actions at turns 8 to 16. Then at turn 17 we are at 9. But we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 8+9-1 = 16. \n\nBut we are at 9 at turn 17, not 16. \n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at turn 16. How? We start at 0 at turn 8. We need to be at 9 at turn 16. That is 8 turns later. We can only move 8 steps? So we can only get to 8 at turn 16? \n\nBut wait: \n  Turn 8: y0 = 0\n  Turn 9: y1 = 0 + Δy8 -> if U, then 1\n  Turn 10: y2 = 1 + Δy9 -> 2\n  ...\n  Turn 16: y8 = 7 + Δy15 -> 8\n\nSo at turn 16, we are at 8. Then we need to take one more action to get to 9 at turn 17.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at 9 at turn 16. The earliest is turn 17.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we must be at 9. So t1+H-1 = 17 -> 8+H-1=17 -> H=10.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+9 (10 actions). The last action is at turn 17? Then at turn 18 we move to 9 + Δy. But we want to be at 9 at turn 17? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me reread the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnd the sequence of actions is for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the player update: at turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t, then we go to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we require that the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nHow did we get there? By the action at turn t1+H-2. \n\nBut then we also take an action at turn t1+H-1? And then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy.\n\nSo the minimal H is the number of actions we take until we have achieved being at 9 at the start of a turn. But we start at turn t1 at 0. We need to be at 9 at the start of some turn T. The earliest T is t1+9 = 17. Then we have taken 9 actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+8) to get to 9 at turn t1+9. But then we are at 9 at turn t1+9, so we set H-1 = 9? Then H=10, and the sequence of actions is 10 actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+9. But the last action (at turn t1+9) is taken when we are at 9, and then we move to 10? But we don't want that.\n\nAlternatively, we can stop once we are at 9. But the problem requires a sequence of exactly H actions that result in being at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWe are at 9 at turn t1+9 (17). We want this to be turn t1+H-1. So 8 + H - 1 = 17 -> H=10.\n\nBut then we are taking 10 actions. The first 9 actions (from turn 8 to 16) get us to 9 at turn 17. Then we take one more action at turn 17? But then at turn 18 we are at 9+Δy. \n\nThe problem does not say we stop when we reach 9. It says we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So for H=10, we are at 9 at turn 17 (t1+9 = 17). Then we take an action at turn 17, which is the 10th action. What action? It doesn't matter for the requirement, but we must provide one. And we are allowed to go beyond 9? But the rule says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and we choose U, then we stay at 9? Because the rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, but then clamped to [0,9]. The problem says: y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and choose U, we stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly, D would go to 8, but we don't want that. So we should choose S or U? But the goal is already achieved at the start of turn 17, so we can choose S at turn 17 to stay at 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We want minimal H. If we can achieve being at 9 at an earlier turn with a different path? But we cannot because we have to make 9 moves up. The earliest turn to be at 9 is 17. So H must be 10.\n\nBut let me confirm with a smaller example: if we start at y=0 and want to be at y=1, then:\n  At turn t1: we are at 0. \n  We take an action U at turn t1: then at turn t1+1, we are at 1.\n  We require to be at 1 at turn t1+H-1 = t1+1 -> so H-1=1 -> H=2.\n  Actions: two actions? But we only need one action to get to 1.\n\nThe problem: we are at y=0 at turn t1. We take action a_{t1} (U) and then at turn t1+1 we are at 1. We want to be at 1 at turn t1+H-1. So we set t1+H-1 = t1+1 -> H=2.\n\nThen the sequence is two actions: \n  Turn t1: U \n  Turn t1+1: ? \n\nBut then at turn t1+1, we are at 1, and then we take an action. We can choose S, for example.\n\nSo for our problem, we will have 10 actions: 9 Ups and then one more action (S or U) at the last turn when we are at 9.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is defined as the minimal number of turns (the sequence length) such that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. The earliest turn we can be at 9 is 17, so we set H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\nSo we will simulate until turn 17.\n\nNow, we must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8 when we are on them.\n\nWe will simulate the player's path from turn 8 to turn 17, and we hope to go straight up: \n  Turn 8: y=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\n  Turn 9: y=1 -> check freeway 1 at turn 9\n  Turn 10: y=2 -> freeway 2 at turn 10\n  ...\n  Turn 16: y=8 -> freeway 8 at turn 16\n  Turn 17: y=9 -> safe\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway i (1..8) at turn (8+i) whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway and for the required turn:\n\nFirst, T_rel = T - 8.\n\nFreeway 1 at turn 9: T_rel=1\n  Car: [-83+36*1, -48+36*1] = [-47, -12] -> 0 is not in [-47,-12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 10: T_rel=2\n  Car: [-83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? -> yes, 0 is in the interval. So collision!\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 2 at turn 10 if we go straight up.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway 2 at turn 10.\n\nWe have to adjust: we might need to wait at some freeway or move down and then up.\n\nWe need to find a path that avoids collisions.\n\nWe can use BFS or dynamic programming. Since the grid is small (y in 0..9) and the time we care about is from turn 8 to about 8+ (a few more than 9), we can simulate.\n\nWe are at (turn, y) and we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWe start at (8,0). We can choose U, D, S.\n\nConstraints:\n- y must be in [0,9].\n- If y is in [1,8] at turn T, then we must check the cars on freeway y at turn T: if any car's span covers 0, then we collide.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 8+H-1 = 7+H. And we want minimal H.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with turns from 8 onward.\n\nWe can do a BFS by turns.\n\nLet me denote:\n  state = (t, y)\n\nWe start: (8,0) with path [].\n\nThen we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe generate (t+1, y') where y' = y + dy.\n\nWe check for each next state (t+1, y'):\n\n  - If y' is in [1,8], then at turn t+1, we are on freeway y', and we must check the cars on freeway y' at turn t+1: if 0 is in any car's span, then we cannot go there.\n\n  - If y' is 0 or 9, then safe.\n\nWe stop when we are at y=9 at any turn T, and then we set H = T - 8 + 1? \n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 8+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nWhen we are at (T,9), then we set: 8+H-1 = T -> H = T-7.\n\nAnd we want minimal H, i.e., minimal T.\n\nThe minimal T for being at 9 is 17 (by going straight up), but we saw that freeway 2 at turn 10 (T=10) is not safe. So we need to avoid that.\n\nWe must find a path that avoids collisions.\n\nWe'll do a BFS over time.\n\nWe'll let T from 8 upwards.\n\nWe mark states (T,y) that we can reach without collision.\n\nWe start:\n  T=8: y=0 -> safe.\n\nAt T=8, we can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut we want to go up, so D to -1 is invalid, so we can only do U or S.\n\nIf we do S: then at T=9, we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nIf we do U: then at T=9, we are at y=1 -> we check freeway1 at T=9: as above, [-47,-12] -> 0 not in there, safe.\n\nSo from T=8, we have two options: \n  (9,0) by S\n  (9,1) by U\n\nAt T=9:\n  If at (9,0): actions: U (to1), S (to0), D (invalid, so only U and S)\n  If at (9,1): actions: U (to2), D (to0), S (to1)\n\nBut we need to check the next state:\n\nFor (9,0): \n  - If we do U: then T=10, y=1 -> check freeway1 at T=10: \n        freeway1: T_rel=10-8=2 -> [-83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-11,24] -> 0 in there -> collision! So not safe.\n  - If we do S: then T=10, y=0 -> safe.\n\nFor (9,1):\n  - U: T=10, y=2 -> freeway2 at T=10: same car as freeway1? freeway2 has the same car: at T=10, [-11,24] -> 0 in there -> collision!\n  - D: T=10, y=0 -> safe.\n  - S: T=10, y=1 -> freeway1 at T=10: collision (as above for (9,0) doing U) -> so not safe.\n\nSo at T=10, we can only be at y=0 (by two ways: from (9,0) by S, or from (9,1) by D).\n\nBut we want to go up, so we might need to wait.\n\nAt T=10, we are at y=0. Then we can do U or S.\n\nWe need to check further.\n\nBut note: we want minimal H, so we want to arrive at 9 as soon as possible. The earliest is 17, but we are already delayed.\n\nWe need to see if we can get to 9 by T=17 by an alternate path.\n\nWe'll do a BFS and record the minimal time to reach 9.\n\nWe'll use a queue: (T, y, path) but we don't need to store the entire path, we can store the actions and the previous state.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the minimal T for each (T,y) and then backtrack.\n\nBut since the grid is small, we can simulate until T is large enough.\n\nWe'll let T go up to say 25.\n\nWe want to avoid collisions by possibly waiting at y=0 or moving down temporarily.\n\nLet me try to compute the car positions for freeway2 at later turns to see when it is safe.\n\nFreeway2: car span at T: [-83+36*(T-8), -48+36*(T-8)]\n\nWe want 0 not in [L, R] = [ -83+36*(T-8), -48+36*(T-8) ]\n\nSo we want either 0 < L or 0 > R.\n\nThat is: \n  Case 1: 0 < -83+36*(T-8)  => 36*(T-8) > 83 => T-8 > 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T-8>=3 -> T>=11\n  Case 2: 0 > -48+36*(T-8) => 36*(T-8) < 48 => T-8 < 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> T-8<=1 -> T<=9.\n\nBut T>=8. So at T=8: T_rel=0: L=-83, R=-48 -> safe.\n    T=9: T_rel=1: L=-47, R=-12 -> safe.\n    T=10: T_rel=2: L=-11, R=24 -> unsafe (0 in between).\n    T=11: T_rel=3: L= -83+108=25, R= -48+108=60 -> 0 < 25 -> safe.\n\nSo freeway2 is safe at T=11 and after.\n\nTherefore, if we can be on freeway2 at T=11 or later, then safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 and freeway3 have the same car, so same behavior: unsafe only at T=10.\n\nFreeway4,5,6: \n  Freeway4: car: [-71+24*(T-8), -48+24*(T-8)]\n  We want to know when 0 is in the interval.\n\n  Solve: \n    -71+24*k <= 0 <= -48+24*k  (where k=T-8)\n    => \n      24*k >= 71 -> k>=71/24≈2.96 -> k>=3\n      24*k <= 48? -> k<=2. \n    But k>=3 and k<=2 is impossible. So when is 0 in the interval?\n\n    Actually, we need:\n        L <= 0 <= R\n        -71+24*k <= 0 and 0 <= -48+24*k\n        => 24*k >=71 and 24*k>=48 -> the binding constraint is 24*k>=71 -> k>=3\n        and 0<=-48+24*k -> 24*k>=48 -> k>=2.\n\n        But also, we require L<=0 and 0<=R.\n\n        At k=2: L = -71+48 = -23, R = -48+48=0 -> then 0 is in [ -23,0] -> yes, because R=0.\n        At k=3: L = -71+72=1, R= -48+72=24 -> then 0 is not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\n    So only at k=2 (T=10) and k= ? \n        k=2: T=10 -> unsafe (because 0 in [-23,0])\n        k=1: T=9: L=-71+24=-47, R=-48+24=-24 -> 0 not in [-47,-24] -> safe.\n        k=0: safe.\n\n    But wait: at k=2, R=-48+24*2 = -48+48=0, so [ -23, 0] -> 0 is included.\n\n    And at k=3: [1,24] -> safe.\n\n    So freeway4 is unsafe only at T=10.\n\n    Similarly, freeway5 and 6 are the same.\n\nNow freeway7 and 8: they have three cars each.\n\nFreeway7 at turn T: \n  Car1: [37+4*(T-8), 48+4*(T-8)]\n  Car2: [1+4*(T-8), 12+4*(T-8)]\n  Car3: [-35+4*(T-8), -24+4*(T-8)]\n\nWe need to know for which T, 0 is in one of these intervals.\n\nWe'll compute for T from 8 to 20.\n\nT_rel = T-8.\n\nCar1: [37+4*k, 48+4*k] -> for k>=0, this is always positive and increasing, so 0 is never in it.\n\nCar2: [1+4*k, 12+4*k] -> also always positive for k>=0, so 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [-35+4*k, -24+4*k]\n\nWe want 0 in [-35+4*k, -24+4*k] \n  => -35+4*k <= 0 and 0 <= -24+4*k\n  => 4*k <=35 -> k<=8.75\n     4*k>=24 -> k>=6\n\nSo for k=6,7,8: \n  k=6: L=-35+24=-11, R=-24+24=0 -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> unsafe at T=8+6=14\n  k=7: L=-35+28=-7, R=-24+28=4 -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe at T=15\n  k=8: L=-35+32=-3, R=-24+32=8 -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe at T=16\n  k=9: L=1, R=12 -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 is unsafe at T=14,15,16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 is the same.\n\nSummary of unsafe (freeway, turn):\n  Freeway1: T=10\n  Freeway2: T=10\n  Freeway3: T=10\n  Freeway4: T=10\n  Freeway5: T=10\n  Freeway6: T=10\n  Freeway7: T=14,15,16\n  Freeway8: T=14,15,16\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway i at turn T if (i,T) is in the above list.\n\nNow, we plan the path:\n\nWe start at T=8, y=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9 as fast as possible, avoiding:\n\n  - At T=10, we cannot be on freeways 1 to 6 (so we must be at y=0 or y>=7? but y=7 and 8 are freeways 7 and 8, which are safe at T=10).\n\nAt T=10, freeway7 and 8 are safe? \n  Freeway7 at T=10: T_rel=2 -> \n      Car1: [37+8,48+8]=[45,56] -> safe\n      Car2: [1+8,12+8]=[9,20] -> safe\n      Car3: [-35+8,-24+8]=[-27,-16] -> safe\n  Similarly freeway8.\n\nSo at T=10, we can be at y=0,7,8,9? but we are at T=10, and we start at 0 at T=8, so we can only be at y<=2+? Actually, we can be at most at y=2 (if we go up at T=8 and T=9). But we saw that if we go up twice we get to y=2 at T=10 and then we collide on freeway2. \n\nBut if we can get to y=7 at T=10, that would be safe. However, from y=0 at T=8, to y=7 at T=10, we need to go up 7 in 2 moves: impossible.\n\nTherefore, at T=10, we must be at y=0 (by not moving up at T=8 or T=9) or y=1 by moving up only once? but y=1 at T=10 is freeway1 -> unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at T=10: freeway2 -> unsafe.\n\ny=3: freeway3 -> unsafe.\n\ny=4: freeway4 -> unsafe.\n\ny=5: freeway5 -> unsafe.\n\ny=6: freeway6 -> unsafe.\n\ny=7: freeway7 -> safe.\n\ny=8: freeway8 -> safe.\n\nBut we cannot reach y=7 or 8 in two moves from 0. The maximum we can go is 2 moves: y=2.\n\nTherefore, the only safe y at T=10 is 0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=10.\n\nHow to get there?\n\nAt T=8: we are at 0. We can choose:\n  Option1: S -> then at T=9, y=0.\n  Option2: U -> then at T=9, y=1.\n\nBut then at T=9:\n  If we are at 0: then we can choose S (to stay at 0) -> then T=10, y=0: safe.\n  If we are at 1: then we can choose D (to go to 0) -> then T=10, y=0: safe.\n\nSo two ways:\n\nPath1: \n  T8: S -> T9:0 -> T10:0 (by S again at T9)\n\nPath2:\n  T8: U -> T9:1 -> T10:0 (by D at T9)\n\nWe choose the one that leads to the minimal total time. Both get to T=10 at y=0.\n\nNow, from T=10, y=0, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the unsafe turns for freeway7 and 8 at T=14,15,16.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the earliest turn. The earliest we can be at y=9 is T=10 + 9 = 19? But we might be able to do it faster if we go up without stopping? But we are at 0 at T=10, and we need 9 moves up: T=10:0, T=11:1, T=12:2, T=13:3, T=14:4, T=15:5, T=16:6, T=17:7, T=18:8, T=19:9.\n\nBut we have to avoid:\n\n  - At T=14: we are at y=4 (if we go straight up) -> freeway4: is it safe? \n        We know freeway4 is unsafe only at T=10? and safe otherwise? \n        But our summary: freeway4 only unsafe at T=10. So safe.\n\n  - But we also have to avoid freeway7 and 8 at T=14,15,16? but we are not on freeway7 or 8 until we get to y=7 or 8.\n\n  At T=16: we are at y=6 (freeway6) -> freeway6 is unsafe only at T=10? so safe.\n\n  At T=17: y=7 -> freeway7: and T=17: T_rel=17-8=9 -> freeway7: \n        Car3: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [1,12] -> 0 not in there? safe? \n        Actually, at k=9: Car3: [1,12] -> does not cover 0. \n        So safe.\n\n  At T=18: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7 at T=18: T_rel=10 -> Car3: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\n  Then T=19: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo if we go straight up from T=10 to T=19, we get to 9 at T=19.\n\nBut is there a faster way? We are at 0 at T=10, and we go up every turn, then we get to 9 at T=19. \n\nBut can we be faster? We cannot because we need 9 moves.\n\nBut we might be able to avoid the delays by taking a different route? We are already at T=10, and we need 9 moves, so T=19 is the earliest.\n\nBut we started at T=8, so the total turns from start: T=19. Then H-1 = 19 - 8 = 11? \n  We require at turn 8+H-1 we are at 9: 8+H-1=19 -> H=12.\n\nBut we took 11 actions: from T=8 to T=18 (11 actions) and then at T=19 we are at 9.\n\nBut let me count:\n\n  Actions at turns: 8,9,10,...,18: that's 11 actions (H=11) and then at turn 19 (which is 8+11) we are at 9? \n  But the last state is at turn 8+H-1 = 8+11-1 = 18. We are at 9 at turn 18? \n\nNo: \n  At turn 18: we are at y=8 (if we went up every turn from T=10 to T=18: that's 8 moves, so from 0 to 8 at T=18). Then we take an action at T=18: U, and then at T=19 we are at 9. \n\nBut we require to be at 9 at turn 8+H-1. So we want at turn 18 to be at 9? That would be if we got to 9 by the action at T=17. \n\nBut from T=10 (y=0) to T=18 (8 turns) we can only get to 8. \n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at T=19. So 8+H-1=19 -> H=12.\n\nSo we have 12 actions.\n\nBut we might find a path that gets to 9 earlier? How? We cannot get to 9 in fewer than 9 moves from y=0. And we are at y=0 at T=10, so the earliest is T=19.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe freeway7 and 8 at T=14,15,16? In the straight path, we are not on freeway7 or 8 until T=17 (y=7) and T=18 (y=8), and we saw that at T=17 and T=18, freeway7 and 8 are safe.\n\nSo the straight up path from T=10 is safe.\n\nBut we have two ways to get to T=10 at y=0: \n  Path1: T8:S, T9:S -> then T10:0\n  Path2: T8:U, T9:D -> then T10:0\n\nWhich one to choose? Both are safe and both get to the same state at T=10. Then from T=10, we go straight up: U every turn.\n\nWe want the minimal H, and both will have the same H: 12.\n\nBut let's write the full path for both.\n\nOption1 (waiting at 0 for two turns):\n  T8: S -> y=0\n  T9: S -> y=0\n  T10: U -> y=1\n  T11: U -> y=2\n  T12: U -> y=3\n  T13: U -> y=4\n  T14: U -> y=5\n  T15: U -> y=6\n  T16: U -> y=7\n  T17: U -> y=8\n  T18: U -> y=9\n\nBut then at T18, we are at 9? But we require to be at 9 at turn 8+H-1. \n  At T18: we are at 9? How? \n  At T17: we are at 8, then we take U at T17, then at T18 we are at 9. \n  So we are at 9 at T18. Then we set: 8+H-1=18 -> H=11.\n\nWait, I see a confusion in the counting.\n\nWe start at T=8 at y=0.\n\nWe take action at T=8: S -> T=9: y=0.\nAction at T=9: S -> T=10: y=0.\nAction at T=10: U -> T=11: y=1.\n...\nAction at T=17: U -> T=18: y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at T=18.\n\nTherefore, 8+H-1=18 -> H=11.\n\nThe actions: from T=8 to T=17: 10 actions? \n  T=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: that's 10 actions.\n\nBut we have 10 actions: \n  T8: S\n  T9: S\n  T10: U\n  T11: U\n  T12: U\n  T13: U\n  T14: U\n  T15: U\n  T16: U\n  T17: U\n\nThen at T18, we are at 9. And T18 = 8+10? But 8+10=18. And we require to be at 9 at turn 8+H-1. So 8+H-1=18 -> H-1=10 -> H=11.\n\nAnd the sequence has 11 actions? But we have 10 actions above. \n\nThe problem: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: that's H actions. So we need to specify H actions. \n\nBut we have 10 actions that get us to 9 at T=18. Then we must also specify an action for T=18? because the sequence goes to t=H-1=10 (if H=11, then t from 0 to 10, which is 11 actions). \n\nWe have only taken 10 actions so far (T=8 to T=17). We need one more action at T=18? \n\nBut then at T=19, we are at 9+Δy. \n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at turn 8+H-1=8+11-1=18. We are at 9 at T=18. Then we take an action at T=18. We can choose S to stay at 9.\n\nSo the full sequence for H=11:\n\n  T8: S\n  T9: S\n  T10: U\n  T11: U\n  T12: U\n  T13: U\n  T14: U\n  T15: U\n  T16: U\n  T17: U\n  T18: S   (this action doesn't change the position)\n\nThen at T=18, we are at 9 (from the previous action) and then we take S and remain at 9 at T=19? But we only care that at T=18 we are at 9.\n\nActually, the state at the start of T=18 is 9. Then we take action S, and then at T=19 we are at 9. But the requirement is satisfied at the start of T=18.\n\nBut note: the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). At turn 18 (which is t1+10) we are at 9. And we set H=11, so t1+H-1=8+11-1=18. Correct.\n\nSo we have 11 actions.\n\nBut we have another option: \n  T8: U\n  T9: D\n  T10: U\n  ... but then we are also at 0 at T10.\n\nAnd then the same as above.\n\nBut in this case, we do:\n  T8: U -> to y=1 at T9\n  T9: D -> to y=0 at T10\n  Then T10: U -> y=1 at T11\n  ... and then we go up.\n\nBut then at T11: y=1 -> freeway1 at T11: T_rel=3 -> [-83+36*3, -48+36*3]=[-83+108, -48+108]=[25,60] -> safe.\n  Then we can go up normally.\n\nBut we are one turn behind: we get to y=1 at T11 (instead of T10 in the first option). Then we need 8 more moves: from T11 to T18: \n  T11:1 -> T12:2 -> ... T18:8 -> then T19:9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at T19, not T18. Then H would be 12: because we require 8+H-1=19 -> H=12.\n\nThis is worse. So we prefer the first option: wait at 0 for two turns (by doing S,S) and then go up.\n\nBut we have to check the entire path for collisions.\n\nFirst option (S at T8 and T9, then U from T10 to T17, then S at T18):\n\n  T8: y=0 (safe)\n  T9: y=0 (safe)\n  T10: y=0 (safe) -> action U: then at T11: y=1\n  T11: y=1 -> freeway1: T=11 -> safe (as above, [25,60])\n  T12: y=2 -> freeway2: T=12: T_rel=4 -> [-83+36*4, -48+36*4]=[-83+144, -48+144]=[61,96] -> safe\n  T13: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway1 and 2: safe at T>=11.\n  T14: y=4 -> freeway4: T=14: T_rel=6 -> [-71+24*6, -48+24*6]=[-71+144, -48+144]=[73,96] -> safe\n  T15: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4: safe\n  T16: y=6 -> freeway6: safe\n  T17: y=7 -> freeway7: T=17: T_rel=9 -> \n        Car3: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9]=[1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe\n  T18: y=8 -> freeway8: T=18: T_rel=10 -> Car3: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16] -> safe\n  Then we take S at T18: then at T19: y=8+0=8? But we were at y=8 at T18, and we take S, so we stay at 8? \n\nWait, no: at T18, we are at y=8 (because at T17 we were at 7 and then we took U at T17 to go to 8 at T18). Then at T18, we take action S, so we stay at 8? Then at T19 we are at 8. \n\nBut we need to be at 9 at T18? \n\nI see the mistake.\n\nIn the first option, we did:\n\n  T10: U -> T11:1\n  T11: U -> T12:2\n  T12: U -> T13:3\n  T13: U -> T14:4\n  T14: U -> T15:5\n  T15: U -> T16:6\n  T16: U -> T17:7\n  T17: U -> T18:8   [we are at 8 at T18, not 9]\n\nThen we need one more U:\n\n  T18: U -> T19:9\n\nSo we are at 9 at T19.\n\nTherefore, we need to go up at T18 to get to 9 at T19.\n\nSo the full actions:\n\n  T8: S -> T9:0\n  T9: S -> T10:0\n  T10: U -> T11:1\n  T11: U -> T12:2\n  T12: U -> T13:3\n  T13: U -> T14:4\n  T14: U -> T15:5\n  T15: U -> T16:6\n  T16: U -> T17:7\n  T17: U -> T18:8\n  T18: U -> T19:9\n\nThen we are at 9 at T19. Then we set H such that 8+H-1=19 -> H=12.\n\nBut we have 11 actions? from T8 to T18: that's 11 actions. Then we need one more action at T19? \n\nBut we are at 9 at T19. So we require to be at 9 at turn 8+H-1=19 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nThen we take 12 actions: T8 to T19.\n\nAt T19, we are at 9, and then we take an action (say S) to stay at 9.\n\nBut we can also stop earlier? \n\nWe are at 9 at T19. So the action at T18 (U) got us to 9 at T19. Then at T19, we are at 9. We then take an action at T19 (the 12th action) and we choose S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  T8: S\n  T9: S\n  T10: U\n  T11: U\n  T12: U\n  T13: U\n  T14: U\n  T15: U\n  T16: U\n  T17: U\n  T18: U   -> this moves us to 9 at T19\n  T19: S   -> we are at 9 at the start of T19, and we take S to stay.\n\nBut then at T19, we are at 9, and we take S, and then at T20 we are at 9. But the requirement is satisfied at the start of T19.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nBut is there a faster way? We are at 0 at T10. We need 9 moves up. The earliest we can be at 9 is T19.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to go faster by not waiting the full two turns? But we have to be at 0 at T10.\n\nAnother idea: after T10, we might be able to go up faster? but we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr use a different path that avoids the freeways at the unsafe times by waiting at other freeways? \n\nFor example, at T=14,15,16, freeway7 and 8 are unsafe. But we are not on them until T17 and T18. And we saw they are safe at T17 and T18.\n\nBut what if we get to y=7 earlier? \n\nFrom T=10 at y=0, we go up every turn: \n  T10:0 -> T11:1 -> T12:2 -> T13:3 -> T14:4 -> T15:5 -> T16:6 -> T17:7 -> T18:8 -> T19:9.\n\nWe cannot be faster.\n\nBut we might be able to be at y=7 at T=17 (as above) and y=8 at T=18, then y=9 at T=19.\n\nBut note that freeway7 is unsafe at T=14,15,16. We are on freeway7 at T=17, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at T=18 is safe.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nBut we have to check freeway7 at T=17: we did: safe.\n\nNow, is there a way to be at y=9 at an earlier turn? Only if we can reduce the waiting. But we have to be at 0 at T=10. \n\nWhat if we do not wait the full two turns? But we must be at 0 at T=10.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down? But that would make it worse.\n\nOr we could go up to y=9 by a different route that avoids being on freeways 1-6 at T=10, but we cannot because we can't jump.\n\nAnother idea: after T=10, we could move up and then down to avoid being on freeway7 at T=14,15,16? But we are not on freeway7 until we get to y=7, which is at T=17, which is safe.\n\nSo no need.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at 9 at T=18.\n\nHow? We start at T=8 at 0. We need to be at 9 at T=18. That requires 9 moves up in 10 turns (from T=8 to T=17: 10 actions?).\n\nThe number of Up moves must be 9, and we have 10 actions (from T=8 to T=17) or 11 actions (if we include T=18) for H=12.\n\nTo be at 9 at T=18, we must have taken 9 Ups and 1 other move (which could be a down or a stay) in the 10 actions from T=8 to T=17. But we also have to avoid collisions.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on freeway1-6 at T=10. So at T=10, we must be at y=0.\n\nThat means that in the first two actions (T=8 and T=9), we must have a net change of 0. So we can do:\n  Option1: S, S\n  Option2: U, D\n\nThen from T=10 (0) to T=18, we have 8 actions. We need 9 Ups? impossible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at 9 at T=18. The earliest is T=19.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nNow, we have two ways to get to T=10 at 0: \n  A: S at T8, S at T9\n  B: U at T8, D at T9\n\nBoth are safe. We can choose either.\n\nLet me choose option A: S, S.\n\nThen the actions from T=10 to T=18: we need to go from 0 to 9 in 9 moves, so 9 Ups. But we have 9 actions: T10 to T18. Then at T19 we are at 9.\n\nBut then we need one more action at T19 (the 12th action). \n\nSo the full actions:\n\n  T8: S\n  T9: S\n  T10: U\n  T11: U\n  T12: U\n  T13: U\n  T14: U\n  T15: U\n  T16: U\n  T17: U\n  T18: U  -> moves to 9 at T19\n  T19: S  -> to stay at 9\n\nBut we can also do option B:\n\n  T8: U\n  T9: D\n  T10: U\n  T11: U\n  T12: U\n  T13: U\n  T14: U\n  T15: U\n  T16: U\n  T17: U\n  T18: U\n  T19: S\n\nThis also gets to 9 at T19.\n\nBoth have the same length.\n\nI'll choose option A.\n\nBut we must verify that the entire path is collision-free.\n\nWe already did for the up part from T10 onward. Now verify the first part:\n\n  T8: y=0 -> safe\n  T9: y=0 -> safe\n  T10: y=0 -> safe\n\nThen T10 action U: at T11: y=1 -> freeway1 at T11: [25,60] (safe)\nT11: U -> T12: y=2 -> freeway2: T12: [61,96] (safe)\nT12: U -> T13: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway1: safe (T13: T_rel=5 -> [-83+36*5, -48+36*5]=[97,132] -> safe)\nT13: U -> T14: y=4 -> freeway4: T14: T_rel=6 -> [73,96] (safe)\nT14: U -> T15: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4: safe\nT15: U -> T16: y=6 -> freeway6: safe\nT16: U -> T17: y=7 -> freeway7: T17: T_rel=9 -> \n      Car1: [37+36, 48+36]? no, freeway7 update: \n          Car1: [37+4*9, 48+4*9] = [37+36,48+36]? no, 4*9=36? -> [73,84] -> safe\n          Car2: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> safe\n          Car3: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12] -> safe\nT17: U -> T18: y=8 -> freeway8: T18: T_rel=10 -> \n      Car3: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16] -> safe\nT18: U -> T19: y=9 -> safe\n\nThen T19: S -> stays at 9.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1, so turns 8 to 8+11 = 19? \n  H=12, so t from 0 to 11: \n      t=0: a_{8}\n      t=1: a_{9}\n      ...\n      t=11: a_{19}\n\nBut we have actions for turns 8 to 19: that's 12 actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, we list:\n\nTurn 8: a_8\nTurn 9: a_9\n...\nTurn 19: a_19\n\nBut the last turn we list is 19.\n\nWe have to write the actions for turns 8 to 19.\n\nBut note: the player is at (0,0) at turn 8. Then we take action at turn 8: S, then at turn 9 we are at 0, then action S, then at turn 10 at 0, then U, and so on.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut is there a shorter H? We don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the other option for the first two moves: U then D. That would be:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: U\n... same as above from T10.\n\nBut then the total actions are the same.\n\nWe choose the first option.\n\nSo the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial state at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 8 and 9, then moving up consistently from turn 10 onwards, and finally staying at \\(y = 9\\) on turn 19.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initial Position (Turn 8):** The player is at \\((0, 0)\\), which is safe since freeways start at \\(y = 1\\).\n- **Avoiding Collision at Turn 10:** Freeways 1 to 6 are unsafe at turn 10 because cars cover \\(x = 0\\). To avoid this, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 8 and 9 (using actions `S`).\n- **Path to \\(y = 9\\):** From turn 10, the player moves up (`U`) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 19. The path is checked for collisions:\n  - **Turn 11 (y=1):** Freeway 1 at turn 11 is safe (car span [25, 60], 0 not in interval).\n  - **Turn 12 (y=2):** Freeway 2 at turn 12 is safe (car span [61, 96]).\n  - **Turn 13 (y=3):** Freeway 3 at turn 13 is safe (car span [97, 132]).\n  - **Turn 14 (y=4):** Freeway 4 at turn 14 is safe (car span [73, 96]).\n  - **Turn 15 (y=5):** Freeway 5 (same as 4) is safe.\n  - **Turn 16 (y=6):** Freeway 6 is safe.\n  - **Turn 17 (y=7):** Freeway 7 at turn 17 is safe (cars: [73, 84], [37, 48], [1, 12]; 0 not in any span).\n  - **Turn 18 (y=8):** Freeway 8 at turn 18 is safe (car 3 span [5, 16]).\n- **Reaching \\(y = 9\\):** At turn 18, moving up (`U`) places the player at \\(y = 9\\) for turn 19. The action at turn 19 is `S` to stay at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying the requirement of being at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 8 + 12 - 1 = 19\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 8 to 19 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: S\n}",

Importantly, when the player moves to a new row, they are not on that row until the next turn, so they only check for collision on the row they're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=10. For future turns, I need to compute where the cars will be based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out all the car states at t1=10:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48] at t1=10. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so positions increase over time.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so positions decrease.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so positions increase.\n\nFor freeway 1: direction right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)] since head and tail both increase.\n\nThe span at T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it's [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)].\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving based on the data.\n\nLet me confirm the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nHead is -48, tail is -83? That seems odd because usually head is ahead, but for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail.\n\n-48 is greater than -83, so head = -48, tail = -83, so since right-moving, the car is from x=-83 to x=-48 at t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: same: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) head -48, tail -71? -48 > -71, so from -71 to -48.\n\nTail -71, head -48, so span [-71, -48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor each: first car head 48, tail 37, so span [37,48] since right-moving.\n\nSecond: head 12, tail 1, span [1,12]\n\nThird: head -24, tail -35, span [-35,-24]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car where 0 is in its span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at turn t1=10. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so it's safe. But we need to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once there, no issue. But we have to pass through y=1 to 8, avoiding when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, we need to time the vertical moves so that when on a row, no car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, player position updates after action, so when we say at turn T, player is at y_T, that means after the action at T-1 or something? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nFrom the player update: at time t, position y_t. After action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 ∈ Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) is the car's position at turn T.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we start at turn t1=10, position y_{t1} = 0.\n\nWe need to find actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to some H, such that after H turns, y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but t is relative to t1.\n\nIn the action sequence: {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the player position, after H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1, the position at time t1+H should be considered.\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t is applied at time t, to move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at start of turn t, position y_t, then choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision checked at turn T: when position is y_T, and if y_T in 1-8, check if any car on that row has 0 in span at time T.\n\nWe start at t1=10, y_{10} = 0.\n\nWe need to reach a state where y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe target is to have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, but t1 + H - 1 is the time when position is 9.\n\nAfter H actions, the time is t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 1}, which are H actions, leading to position at time t1+H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at time t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 2}, we get y_{t1 + H - 1}, and then if we set a_{t1 + H - 1}, we get y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t1 + H - 1} to reach y_{t1 + H}, I think.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nLet's read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t1 + 0 to t1 + (H-1).\n\nAfter applying these H actions, the position changes from y_{t1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBecause after a_{t1}, y_{t1+1}, after a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, ..., after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9, I think.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's check: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nPerhaps the indexing is different.\n\nMaybe y_{t1 + H - 1} is the position after H-1 actions or something.\n\nAssume time starts at t1.\n\nAt time t1, position y_{t1} = 0.\n\nThen we apply action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at time t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter applying actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 1}, we have positions from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nThe position at time t1+H is y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want this to be 9 for some H.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\", which is the position at time t1 + H - 1.\n\nThat means after H-1 actions, from t1 to t1+H-2, we reach y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThen the action sequence has H actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, but if y_{t1+H-1} = 9, then a_{t1+H-1} is the action that might move from 8 to 9 or something, but it's the position at time t1+H-1 that is 9.\n\nLet's see the answer format: it lists actions starting from turn t1, so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\" so at time t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =0, which is not 9, so H must be at least 1.\n\nIf H=9, y_{t1+8} =9, so at time t1+8, position is 9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which affect positions from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nSo for instance, to have y_{t1+H-1} =9, the action a_{t1+H-2} is the one that sets it to 9 if from 8, or stays, etc.\n\nBut in terms of time, at time t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nAnd we apply actions up to a_{t1+H-1}, which sets y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that as long as we've reached 9 at t1+H-1.\n\nSince we want to be at (0,9), and once there, we can stop, so the sequence can end when we reach 9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is a_{t1+H-1}, and after that, at time t1+H, position is y_{t1+H}, but we want y_{t1+H-1} =9, so at time t1+H-1, we are at 9, and a_{t1+H-1} could be S to stay, or something, but the position is already 9 at that time.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of actions, which is H.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 moves up, but we can move down or stay, so H could be more than 9.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9 if we only go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars, so it might take more turns if we need to wait.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, when a car is at x=0, so that it is unsafe to be on that row at that turn.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, collision if for some car on k, 0 in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) depends on the car's initial position at t1 and speed.\n\nLet t = T - t1, so t is the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + t, for t >=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at time t1.\n\nSince all are right-moving, d=right.\n\nSpan at time T = t1 + t is [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nBecause for right-moving, span is [τ + s (T - t1), h + s (T - t1)]\n\nT - t1 = t, so [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nWhich means the car covers x=0 at time t.\n\nFor each car, we can find the time t when 0 is in [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nSo τ + s t <= 0 and 0 <= h + s t\n\nSince τ <= h usually, but in this case, for right-moving, τ is left end, h is right end, so τ <= h.\n\nSo 0 in [τ + st, h + st] iff τ + st <= 0 <= h + st\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h/s <= t <= -τ/s ? Let's solve.\n\nFrom τ + s t <= 0, so s t <= -τ, t <= -τ/s\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s t, so h + s t >=0, s t >= -h, t >= -h/s\n\nSince s >0.\n\nSo t >= ceil(-h/s) and t <= floor(-τ/s)? Need to be careful with inequalities.\n\nτ + s t <= 0 implies t <= floor(-τ/s) if s integer, but s is integer, t integer.\n\nSince t is integer, we need to find t such that max( ceil(-h/s) , something) let's think.\n\nThe interval for t is from t_low to t_high where t_low = ceil( -h/s ) and t_high = floor( -τ/s )\n\nBecause:\n\nt must satisfy t >= -h/s and t <= -τ/s\n\nSince t integer, t >= ceil(-h/s) and t <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nFor example, if -h/s is integer, ceil(-h/s) = -h/s, etc.\n\nSimilarly, floor(-τ/s).\n\nThen for that car, at times t where ceil(-h/s) <= t <= floor(-τ/s), 0 is in span.\n\nBut we need to consider all cars on the freeway, since any one can cause collision.\n\nFor a freeway, it is unsafe at time t if for any car on it, 0 is in span at that t.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: car: h = -48, τ = -83, s = 36, right-moving.\n\nt_low = ceil(-h/s) = ceil( -(-48)/36 ) = ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nt_high = floor(-τ/s) = floor( -(-83)/36 ) = floor(83/36) = floor(2.305...) = 2\n\n83/36 = 2.305, floor is 2.\n\nt_low = ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nt_high = floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo t from 2 to 2, so only at t=2, unsafe.\n\nt=2 means turn T = t1 + t = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nBut we care about t, the offset.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so also unsafe only at t=2.\n\nFreeway 3: same, unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: car: h = -48, τ = -71, s = 24\n\nt_low = ceil(-h/s) = ceil( -(-48)/24 ) = ceil(48/24) = ceil(2) = 2\n\nt_high = floor(-τ/s) = floor( -(-71)/24 ) = floor(71/24) = floor(2.958) = 2\n\n71/24 = 2.958, floor 2.\n\nSo t=2 only.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=4, right-moving.\n\nt_low = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-48/4) = ceil(-12) = -12\n\nt_high = floor(-τ/s) = floor(-37/4) = floor(-9.25) = -10? Let's compute.\n\n-τ/s = -37/4 = -9.25, floor is -10? Floor is greatest integer less than or equal.\n\n-9.25, less than -9, so floor is -10.\n\nSimilarly, -h/s = -48/4 = -12, ceil(-12) = -12.\n\nt must satisfy t >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-12) = -12\n\nt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-37/4) = floor(-9.25) = -10\n\nSo t from -12 to -10 inclusive.\n\nBut t is offset from t1, t >=0? t is number of turns after t1, so t >=0.\n\nt= -12 to -10, all negative, so for t>=0, this car never covers x=0. Because at t1, span [37,48], which is positive, and moving right, so always positive, never at 0. So no unsafe time for this car at t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 7: h=12, τ=1, s=4\n\nt_low = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-12/4) = ceil(-3) = -3\n\nt_high = floor(-τ/s) = floor(-1/4) = floor(-0.25) = -1\n\nt from -3 to -1, all negative, so no unsafe for t>=0.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=4\n\nt_low = ceil(-h/s) = ceil( -(-24)/4 ) = ceil(24/4) = ceil(6) = 6\n\nt_high = floor(-τ/s) = floor( -(-35)/4 ) = floor(35/4) = floor(8.75) = 8\n\nSo t from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nThus for freeway 7, unsafe when t=6,7,8 because of the third car.\n\nThe other cars don't contribute for t>=0.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars, so also unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, freeways 1 to 6 each have one car, unsafe only at t=2.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=0 is turn t1=10.\n\nWe need to be on row y at time t (offset) only when it is safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=0 (offset, time t1=10).\n\ny=0 is safe always, no cars.\n\nTarget y=9, safe always.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path must go through rows 1 to 8, but we can stay or move, so we might not be on every row.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t at time t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nPosition at time u is y_u.\n\nFor collision at time u, if y_u in 1-8, and freeway y_u is unsafe at time u.\n\nTime u corresponds to offset t = u - t1.\n\nSince we use offset t, time is t1 + t.\n\nAt offset t, position y_{t1+t}, but to simplify, let's use t as offset.\n\nAt time offset t, position y_t (meaning at turn t1+t).\n\nIn the state, at time offset t, position is y_t.\n\nThen action a_t is applied, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δa_t.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} and for freeway k=y_t, it is unsafe at time t.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\nFor freeway 1: unsafe at t=2\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at t=2\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at t=2\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at t=2\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at t=2\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at t=2\n\nAll freeways 1-6 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\nNow, y=1 to 8, but freeways are rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to ensure that when on row k at time t, it is safe, meaning not unsafe at that t.\n\nFor rows 1-6, they are unsafe only at t=2, so safe at all other times.\n\nFor rows 7 and 8, unsafe at t=6,7,8, so safe only when t not in {6,7,8}.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from 0 to 9, at least 9 up moves, so H at least 9.\n\nIf we go up every turn, we would be at y=t at time t, since start y=0 at t=0, after one up, y=1 at t=1, and so on, up to y=9 at t=9.\n\nNow, check if this path has collisions.\n\nAt time t, position y=t.\n\nFor t=1, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nIs it safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=1, safe.\n\nt=1, offset t=1.\n\nTime offset t=1, y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=2, not t=1, so safe.\n\nt=2, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at t=2, so collision! At time t=2, on row 2, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for any row 1-6, at t=2, if on that row, collision.\n\nIn this case, at t=2, y=2, row 2 unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, cannot be on any of rows 1-6 at t=2.\n\nSince all are unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow, for rows 7 and 8, unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=6, y=6, row 6, which is safe at t=6 since only unsafe at t=2.\n\nRow 6 is freeway 6, which is unsafe only at t=2, so at t=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=7, y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=7, collision.\n\nt=7, y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, t=8, y=8, row 8 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo in direct up move, collisions at t=2 (on row 2), and at t=7 (on row 7), and t=8 (on row 8).\n\nt=6: y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nBut t=7 and t=8 not safe if on row 7 or 8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 1-6 at t=2, and avoid being on rows 7 or 8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nSince we need to go up, we might need to delay or something.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some time.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we only care about rows 1-8 during the path.\n\nThe critical points are t=2 and t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=2, we must not be on any row 1-6. Since rows 1-6 are all unsafe at t=2, we must be either on y=0, or y=7,8,9, but y=9 not yet, or y>8 not possible, so only y=0 or y=7,8.\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=0, and we move, so at t=2, y could be from 0 to 2 if going up.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6,7,8, we must not be on row 7 or 8, so must be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the target.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, at t=2, we need to not be on rows 1-6, so must be on y=0, or y=7 or 8.\n\nBut at t=0, y=0. After one move, at t=1, y=0 or 1. After two moves, at t=2, y=0,1,2.\n\nWe cannot be at y=1 or 2 at t=2, because those are rows 1-2, unsafe.\n\nSo at t=2, we must be at y=0.\n\nBecause y=7 or 8 not possible by t=2, since max y=2.\n\nThus, at t=2, must be y=0.\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=2, that means we did not move up in the first two turns.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{t1} at t=0, y_{t1+1} = y_11.\n\nAt time offset t=1, position y_1.\n\nAfter a_1 at t=1, y_2 at t=2.\n\nWe need y_2 = 0.\n\nSince start y_0=0.\n\nTo have y_2=0, we must have done S or D, but D to -1 not possible, y>=0, so only S or U, but if U, y increases.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δa_0\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nIf a_0=D, y_1=0, since y=0, D not possible? y=0, D would be y-1=-1, but y>=0, so probably D not allowed at y=0, or it stays, but from the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} =0, similarly at y=9, U not increase.\n\nSo at y=0, D: Δy=-1, but y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) or something, but in the formula, it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D, y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSimilarly, a_t=S, y_{t+1}=y_t.\n\na_t=U, y_{t+1}=min(9, y_t +1)\n\nBut in this case, to have y_2=0, we need to not move up in the first two actions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt t=0: after a_0, y_1 = 0 if a_0 = S or D, or 1 if a_0=U.\n\nThen at t=1: after a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δa_1\n\nIf y_1=0, then y_2=0 if a_1=S or D, or 1 if a_1=U.\n\nIf y_1=1, then y_2=0 if a_1=D, or 1 if a_1=S, or 2 if a_1=U.\n\nTo have y_2=0, we need:\n\n- Either y_1=0 and (a_1=S or D)\n\n- Or y_1=1 and a_1=D\n\nBut since we start at y_0=0, if we do a_0=S or D, y_1=0, then to y_2=0, do S or D.\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1, then to y_2=0, do a_1=D.\n\nBut doing down might not be efficient.\n\nThe simplest is to stay at y=0 for first two turns: a_0=S, a_1=S, then y_1=0, y_2=0.\n\nOr a_0=S, a_1=D, but D at y=0, y still 0, same as S.\n\na_0=D, same.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nWe can do a_0=U, then a_1=D, but that moves to y=1 and back, which takes extra turns, not good for minimal time.\n\nSince we need to go to 9, we should avoid unnecessary down or stay.\n\nBut at t=2, we must be at y=0, so we need to waste two turns not moving up, or move up and down, but moving down costs extra.\n\nSo minimal is to stay at y=0 for t=0 and t=1, so at t=2, y=0.\n\nActions: at t=0: S, t=1: S, then at t=2, y=0.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go up to 9.\n\nBut we also have the issue at t=6,7,8 with rows 7 and 8.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nWe can start moving up.\n\nBut at t=6,7,8, we must not be on row 7 or 8.\n\nSo at those times, we need to be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1-6 are safe except at t=2, which is past.\n\nt=2 is done, now t from 2 onwards.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom t=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nIf we go up every turn, from t=2 to t=11, y=0 at t=2, after up at t=2, y=1 at t=3, ..., up to y=9 at t=11.\n\nt=2: y=0\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 at t=3.\n\nSet time offset:\n\nAt time t (offset), position y_t.\n\nt=2: y_2=0\n\nAfter a_2: if U, y_3=1; S, y_3=0; D, y_3=0\n\nThen at t=3, y_3, and so on.\n\nIf we do U every turn from t=2 to t=10:\n\nt=2: after a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3: position y_3=1, freeway 1? y=1 is row 1.\n\nAt t=3, row 1 safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at t=2, t=3>2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: y=2, row 2, unsafe at t=2, not t=4, safe.\n\n...\n\nUp to t=7: y_7= ? Let's see.\n\nt=2: y_2=0\n\na_2=U: y_3=1 at t=3\n\na_3=U: y_4=2 at t=4\n\na_4=U: y_5=3 at t=5\n\na_5=U: y_6=4 at t=6\n\na_6=U: y_7=5 at t=7\n\na_7=U: y_8=6 at t=8\n\na_8=U: y_9=7 at t=9\n\na_9=U: y_10=8 at t=10\n\na_10=U: y_11=9 at t=11\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt t=3: y=1, row 1, safe (unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=4: y=2, row 2, safe\n\nt=5: y=3, row 3, safe\n\nt=6: y=4, row 4, safe? Row 4 unsafe only at t=2, yes safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, row 5, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, row 7, now row 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8? t=9, which is not 6,7,8.\n\nUnsafe at t=6,7,8 for row 7.\n\nt=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=10: y=8, row 8, unsafe at t=6,7,8, t=10>8, safe.\n\nt=11: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo in this path, no collisions.\n\nBut we started moving from t=2.\n\nTime: we reached y=9 at t=11, offset.\n\nt=11, so time t1 + t = 10 + 11 = 21.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=10, actions a_0 to a_10, that's 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: actions from offset t=0 to H-1.\n\nWe have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at time offset t=11, y_11=9.\n\nTime is t1 + t, so at time t1 + 11, position is 9.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 = t1 + 11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=11? Let's list the times.\n\nStart: at time t1=10, y=0.\n\nWe need actions a_{10}, a_{11}, ..., up to a_{10 + H -1}\n\nAfter these, position at time t1 + H should be... but we want position at time t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nIn the path above, y at time t1 + 11 is 9, so T = t1 + 11.\n\nThus t1 + H -1 = t1 + 11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThe actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{10} to a_{10 + 11} = a_{21}? H=12, actions from t=0 to 11 relative, so a_{10} to a_{21}, but position at time t1 + H -1 = 10 + 11 =21 is y=9.\n\nIn terms of offset, we have actions at offset t=0 to t=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, we applied a_0 to a_10 to get to y_11.\n\na_0 at t=0 (time 10), sets y_1\n\n...\n\na_10 at t=10 (time 20), sets y_11 at time 21.\n\ny_11 at time 21 is 9.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{10 + 12 -1} = y_{21} =9, yes.\n\nNow, in this path, we did:\n\nAt t=0 (time 10): S (to stay at y=0)\n\nt=1 (time 11): S (stay y=0)\n\nThen t=2 (time 12): U, to y=1 at time 13\n\nIn offset:\n\nAt time offset t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y_0=0\n\na_0=S: y_1=0 at t=1\n\na_1=S: y_2=0 at t=2\n\na_2=U: y_3=1 at t=3\n\na_3=U: y_4=2 at t=4\n\na_4=U: y_5=3 at t=5\n\na_5=U: y_6=4 at t=6\n\na_6=U: y_7=5 at t=7\n\na_7=U: y_8=6 at t=8\n\na_8=U: y_9=7 at t=9\n\na_9=U: y_10=8 at t=10\n\na_10=U: y_11=9 at t=11\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nAt each time t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=1, row 1, unsafe only t=2, safe\n\nt=4: y=2, row 2, safe\n\nt=5: y=3, row 3, safe\n\nt=6: y=4, row 4, safe\n\nt=7: y=5, row 5, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, row 7, unsafe at t=6,7,8?

a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{10} to a_{10 + 11} = a_{21}, but a_{21} is applied at time 21 to set y_{22}, but we want y_{21}=9, which is set by a_{20}.\n\nI think the indexing is off.\n\ny_S =9 at time S.\n\nThe action that sets y_S is a_{S-1}.\n\nFor example, to have y_{11} = something, it is set by a_{10}.\n\nIn general, y_T is set by action at T-1.\n\nThus, to have y_S =9, we need actions up to a_{S-1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is a_{t1} to a_{S-1}, number of actions H = S - t1.\n\nThen S = t1 + H, so y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nProblem: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThat is, actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter applying these, position at time (t1+H-1) +1 = t1+H is set.\n\nBut we want position at time t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo at time t1+H-1, before any action, position is y_{t1+H-1}, and it should be 9.\n\nThen we apply a_{t1+H-1} to set y_{t1+H}, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is a_{t1+H-1}, but it is applied at time t1+H-1, which may change position, but the position at that time is before the action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn T, position is y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at the start of turn T, based on y_T and the car positions at time T.\n\nThen after action, we have y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nFor turn T, we are at position y_T, and if y_T in 1-8, check collision with cars at time T.\n\nThen we apply a_T to get y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1=10, y_{10}=0.\n\nWe apply actions a_{10}, a_{11}, ..., up to some point.\n\nWe want for some turn M, y_M =9.\n\nThen the actions to reach y_M=9 are a_{10} to a_{M-1}, and after a_{M-1}, y_M=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{10} to a_{M-1}, that's M - t1 actions.\n\nThen y_M = y_{t1 + (M - t1)} =9.\n\nSet H = M - t1, number of actions, so y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the turn numbering.\n\nAnother possibility: the position at turn T is after the action or before.\n\nI think it's standard to have at turn T, position y_T before action.\n\nBut in the problem, it says: \"current turn is t1, position (0, y_{t1})\"\n\nSo at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nThen action a_{t1} is applied, etc.\n\nAnd we want to reach (0,9), so y_{some turn} =9.\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThen the actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which are applied at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1} =9, then we apply a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nIn terms of reaching, we have reached at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn our earlier path, we have y at turn 21 =9, so if t1 + H -1 =21, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =21, 9 + H =21, H=12.\n\nThen actions from a_{10} to a_{10+11} = a_{21}? a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{10} to a_{10 + 11} = a_{21}, but a_{21} is at turn 21, which sets y_{22}, but we want y_{21}=9, which is set by a_{20}.\n\nLet's list turns.\n\nTurn 10: position y_{10}=0, apply a_{10}, sets y_{11}\n\nTurn 11: position y_{11}, apply a_{11}, sets y_{12}\n\n...\n\nTurn K: position y_K, apply a_K, sets y_{K+1}\n\nWe want y_M =9 for some M.\n\nThen at turn M, position is 9.\n\nTo achieve that, we apply actions from a_{10} to a_{M-1}.\n\nNumber of actions: (M-1) - 10 +1 = M -10.\n\nH = M - t1 = M -10.\n\nThen y_M = y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut problem says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, set S = t1 + H -1, y_S=9.\n\nThen H = (S - t1) +1.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from a_{t1} to a_{S-1}, since a_{S-1} sets y_S.\n\nBut the sequence given is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which for t from 0 to H-1, times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt time t1+H-1, we apply a_{t1+H-1}, which sets y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} =9, which is before applying a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} =9, it must be set by previous actions, up to a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nThen the action a_{t1+H-1} is applied, but it doesn't affect y_{t1+H-1}, it affects future.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t1+H-1}, but it is not necessary for reaching y_{t1+H-1}=9, but we include it as part of the sequence for H turns.\n\nPerhaps for the purpose, we can include it, and it can be S or something.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list the actions, and after that, we are at 9 at that turn.\n\nI think for simplicity, in our path, we can set H such that y at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nIn our path, we have y at turn 21 is 9.\n\nSet S =21, y_S=9.\n\nt1=10, so S = t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1 =21, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions from a_{10} to a_{10+11} = a_{21}? a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{10} to a_{21}.\n\nBut a_{21} is applied at turn 21 to set y_{22}, but at turn 21, position is y_{21}=9, which is already set.\n\nSo the action a_{21} is not needed for reaching y_{21}, but we include it in the sequence for H turns.\n\nSince we have reached at turn 21, we can set a_{21} to S, for example, to stay.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we might not need that extra action.\n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with H=12, actions from a_{10} to a_{21}, but a_{10} to a_{20} set y_{11} to y_{21}, so to have y_{21}=9, we need a_{10} to a_{20}, that's 11 actions, then a_{21} is extra.\n\nLet's count.\n\nTo have y_M=9, we need actions a_{10} to a_{M-1}, number of actions: M-10.\n\nFor example, to have y_{11}=9, actions a_{10} only, one action.\n\ny_{11} is set by a_{10}.\n\nIn general, to have y_M=9, actions from a_{10} to a_{M-1}, number H = M - 10.\n\nThen y_M = y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut problem wants y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, set K = t1 + H -1, y_K=9.\n\nThen K = t1 + H -1.\n\nTo have y_K=9, we need actions a_{10} to a_{K-1}, number of actions: (K-1) - 10 +1 = K -10.\n\nBut H is the number of actions in the sequence, which is from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so for times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt time t1+H-1, position y_{t1+H-1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nSo the actions that set y_{t1+H-1} are a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nThen a_{t1+H-1} is applied but doesn't affect y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nFor the sequence, we include a_{t1+H-1}, which can be S or whatever.\n\nIn our case, with the path, we have y at turn 21 is 9.\n\nSo set t1+H-1 =21, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =21, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions from a_{10} to a_{21}.\n\na_{10} to a_{20} set y_{11} to y_{21}, so for y_{21}=9, we need a_{10} to a_{20}, but a_{21} is also included, which sets y_{22}, not related.\n\nSo for the sequence, we can have a_{10} to a_{20} for moving, and a_{21} can be S.\n\nBut in the list, we need to specify all.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the offset from the beginning.\n\nIn our path, we wasted two turns at start, then moved up in 9 turns, total 11 turns to reach y=9 at turn 21.\n\nTurn 10 to turn 21 is 12 turns? Turn 10,11,12,...,21, that's 12 turns.\n\nPosition at turn 10: y=0\n\nTurn 11: y=0 (after a10=S)\n\nTurn 12: y=0 (after a11=S)\n\nTurn 13: y=1 (after a12=U)\n\n...\n\nTurn 21: y=9 (after a20=U)\n\nAt turn 21, y=9.\n\nActions: a10 to a20, that's 11 actions.\n\nThen for turn 21, we apply a21, but position is already 9.\n\nIn the sequence for H=12, we include a10 to a21.\n\na21 can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the path above with offset, we have actions a0 to a10 for 11 actions, reaching y11 at t=11.\n\nBut for the answer, we'll list the actions.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nH=12 for the sequence.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nEarlier I assumed we stayed at y=0 for two turns.\n\nBut at t=2, we could be at y=7 or 8, but it's impossible to reach y=7 by t=2 from y=0 at t=0.\n\nMax y=2, so only possible to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nSo we must spend at least two turns to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from there, moving up takes at least 9 more turns, so total at least 11 actions to reach y=9 at some turn, but with the turn count, H=12 for the sequence including the last action.\n\nMinimal H is 12.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by moving differently.\n\nFor example, at t=6,7,8, we need to not be on row 7 or 8.\n\nIn the path above, at t=9, y=7, which is safe, t=10, y=8 safe.\n\nBut if we can be faster.\n\nSince we stayed at start, we are late.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, we must be at y=0, so we have to stay or move down, but moving down is worse.\n\nSo staying is best.\n\nThen from t=2, y=0, we go up.\n\nBut at t=6,7,8, we are on lower rows, so safe.\n\nIn the path, at t=6, y=4; t=7, y=5; t=8, y=6; all <=6, so not on 7 or 8, safe.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=11 offset, turn 21.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we don't stay at start, but at t=2, we must be at y=0, so we cannot be higher, so we cannot start moving up earlier.\n\nUnless we move up and then down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, if we go D, to y=0 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=1, we are on y=1, row 1, at time t=1, which is safe, since unsafe only t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=0, safe.\n\nBut we used two actions: U and D, to be at y=0 at t=2, same as staying, but we moved unnecessarily.\n\nThen from there, we go up, same as before, but we are at t=2 y=0, same as staying.\n\nBut with U and D, at t=1 y=1, which is safe, no problem.\n\nBut it takes the same time to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from t=2 y=0, go up to y=9 at t=11, same as before.\n\nBut with U and D, the actions are different, but number of turns same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus minimal H is 12 with the stay-stay-up-up-... sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to list the actions.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, in this path, we are not on them at t=6,7,8, so fine.\n\nBut is there a way to be faster?\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 7 or 8 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nBut since we start late, we are late.\n\nSuppose at t=0, we go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, we go U to y=2 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2, row 2, which is unsafe! Collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at t=0 S, y=0 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1 U, to y=1 at t=2? At t=2, position y_2.\n\nIf at t=1, after action, y_2.\n\nAt t=0: y0=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nThen at t=1, y1=0, a1=U, then y2=1\n\nAt t=2, position y2=1, row 1, unsafe at t=2, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf a1=D, y2=0, but same as staying.\n\nSo only way to avoid collision at t=2 is to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThus, we must have y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from there, we go up as fast as possible.\n\nIn the up move, from t=2 y=0 to t=11 y=9, 9 steps.\n\nBut t=2 to t=11 is 9 steps in time, 9 actions.\n\nActions from a2 to a10, for example.\n\nOffset t=2 to t=10, actions a2 to a10, 9 actions, setting y3 to y11.\n\ny11 at t=11.\n\nBut we start from t=0.\n\nTotal from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions, to reach y11=9 at t=11.\n\nWith H=12, sequence 12 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by moving faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for freeway 7 and 8, since we pass them at t=9 and t=10, which are after t=8, safe.\n\nBut just to confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=7, row 7.\n\nUnsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=9>8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, the cars: for freeway 7, third car, span at time T=t1+t.\n\nt1=10, at t=9, T=19.\n\nCar: initial at t1=10, span [-35,-24], speed 4, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T=19: τ + s(T-t1) = -35 + 4*(19-10) = -35 + 4*9 = -35 + 36 =1\n\nh + s(T-t1) = -24 + 36 =12\n\nSo span [1,12] at T=19, which does not include 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10, T=20, y=8, row 8.\n\nCar on row 8, similar, span at T=20: for the car, τ + s(T-t1) = -35 + 4*10 = -35+40=5\n\nh + s(T-t1) = -24 + 40 =16, span [5,16], not 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt t=11, y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nH=12.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 10: S (stay, y=0)\n\nTurn 11: S (stay, y=0)\n\nThen start moving up:\n\nTurn 12: U (to y=1 at turn 13)\n\nIn terms of time:\n\nAt turn T, action a_T.\n\nTurn 10: a10=S, then y11=0\n\nTurn 11: a11=S, then y12=0\n\nTurn 12: a12=U, then y13=1\n\nTurn 13: a13=U, then y14=2\n\nTurn 14: a14=U, then y15=3\n\nTurn 15: a15=U, then y16=4\n\nTurn 16: a16=U, then y17=5\n\nTurn 17: a17=U, then y18=6\n\nTurn 18: a18=U, then y19=7\n\nTurn 19: a19=U, then y20=8\n\nTurn 20: a20=U, then y21=9\n\nNow, at turn 21, y21=9, which is what we want for y_{t1 + H -1} with H=12, t1=10, t1+H-1=10+12-1=21, y21=9.\n\nThen we need to include a21 as well, but a21 is applied at turn 21 to set y22, but since we have reached at turn 21, we can set a21=S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, it must have H=12 actions, so a10 to a21.\n\na21 can be S.\n\nIn the answer format, we list actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=12, turns 10 to 21.\n\nBut turn 21 action sets y22, but position at turn 21 is already 9.\n\nTo be precise, in the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = S\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = S\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = S  (since we are at y=9, stay)\n\nNow, for the car at t=2, we avoided by staying at y=0.\n\nIs there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go up faster at the end or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7 and 8 are unsafe only at t=6,7,8, and we are at lower rows, but if we could be at y=9 before t=6, but from start, at t=0 y=0, to y=9 at t=9, but at t=2 we have to be at y=0, so cannot reach y=9 before t=11 offset, turn 21.\n\nt=0 to t=9 is 10 turns, but at t=2 must be y=0, so if we go up continuously from t=0, but at t=2 we are at y=2, collision.\n\nIf we delay less, but we must be at y=0 at t=2, so we lose two turns.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 12 actions.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but in our case, we didn't have issue.\n\nPerhaps we can move down to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t1=10.\n\nH=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S  (to stay at 9)\n\nIn the last action, since we are at y=9 at turn 21, applying S is fine.\n\nWe could apply U, but y=9, U does nothing, y stays 9.\n\nBut S is also fine.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nTurn t1=10: action S\n\nThen position at turn 11: y=0\n\nTurn 11: action S, position turn 12: y=0\n\nTurn 12: action U, position turn 13: y=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 20: action U, position turn 21: y=9\n\nTurn 21: action S, position turn 22: y=9\n\nBut we reached at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 21 action is included.\n\nFor the minimal, since we reach at turn 21, we could have H=11 with actions up to turn 20, but let's see.\n\nIf we have actions from a10 to a20, 11 actions.\n\nThen after a20, y21=9, so at turn 21, position is 9.\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{10 + 11 -1} = y_{20}, but y20 is at turn 20, which in the path is y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem: with actions a10 to a20, 11 actions.\n\nAfter a20, y21=9.\n\nAt turn 20, position y20=8 (before action), then apply a20=U, to y21=9.\n\nSo at turn 20, y20=8, not 9.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=11, t1+H-1=10+11-1=20, y20 should be 9, but it is 8.\n\nNot satisfied.\n\nWith H=12, t1+H-1=10+12-1=21, y21=9, good.\n\nAnd we apply a21 at turn 21, which can be S.\n\nSo H=12 is correct.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal \\(H\\) is 12, meaning 12 actions are required from turn 10 to turn 21, resulting in the player being at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Avoiding collisions at \\(t = 2\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\))**: All freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(6\\) are unsafe at \\(t = 2\\) (turn 12) because cars cover \\(x = 0\\). To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 12. This requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two actions (turns 10 and 11).\n- **Avoiding collisions at \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\) (turns 16, 17, 18)**: Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(8\\) are unsafe at these times. In the sequence, the player is at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 16, \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17, and \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18, all below \\(y = 7\\), so no collision occurs.\n- **Minimal turns**: After the initial two stays, moving up continuously from turn 12 to turn 20 reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21. This takes 9 up actions, plus 2 initial stays, totaling 11 actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21. However, \\(H = 12\\) actions are required to satisfy \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{21} = 9\\), including the action at turn 21 to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n- **Car positions**: For all freeways, the car spans at critical times (e.g., \\(t = 2, 6, 7, 8\\)) are computed, confirming safety during the sequence. For example:\n  - At turn 16 (\\(t = 6\\) relative), freeway 7 cars have spans not covering \\(x = 0\\) (e.g., one car span is \\([-35 + 4 \\times 6, -24 + 4 \\times 6] = [-11, 0]\\), but \\(0\\) is only included if the span is inclusive; here, it may touch 0, but since the player is at \\(y = 4\\), no issue). Similarly for other times and freeways.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H = 12\\) and avoids all collisions:\n- Turn 10: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Turn 11: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (ensures safe at turn 12).\n- Turns 12-20: Up (U) each turn to move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 9 actions.\n- Turn 21: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\) (action included to complete \\(H = 12\\)).\n\n### Output in Required Format:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: S \\\\\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 12. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each action can be U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=12, and they move with constant speed. Left-moving cars go left (decreasing x), right-moving go right (increasing x). The span is given as (head, tail), and for left-moving, head > tail, I think? Let me see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\" and it says [h, τ] with h and τ, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the front, so for left-moving, head is larger, I think. Similarly for right-moving, [τ, h] → [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ], so in right-moving, head is the front, so h > τ.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). Direction is right, so it should be moving right. Span at t_1: head and tail. Since it's right-moving, head should be the front, so head = -48, tail = -83? That seems odd because -48 > -83, so if it's moving right, head should be on the right, but -48 is to the right of -83 since x decreases left, I assume? x-axis: smaller x is left, larger x is right.\n\nStandard: x increases to the right, so -83 is left of -48.\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head should be at the right end, tail at left. So for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -83. But -48 > -83, so head is at x=-48, tail at x=-83, so the car spans from x=-83 to x=-48? That would be length 35, since (-48) - (-83) = 35.\n\nSpeed is 36, but units? Probably per turn, but let's see.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but in this case, all cars given are right-moving except possibly, but in the table, all directions are right, I think. Freeway 7 has three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 7: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when a car has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, for each turn, we care about the y-position at that turn.\n\nStart at turn 12, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. But the player starts at (0,0) and needs to reach (0,9), so y=0 and y=9 are the start and end, no cars there, so no collision possible on y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut when the player is moving, they might be on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, and each move changes y by at most 1, we need at least 9 moves up. But we can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 9 if we detour or wait.\n\nBut to minimize H, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions, so we might need to wait or move down to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at the wrong time.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nLet's clarify the turn indexing.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is (0, y_t), then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1, and after H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAt turn t_1, we start at y_{t_1} = 0, and we take action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t_1 + H} should be 9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to be at y=9, the minimal number of up moves is 9, but if we move down or stay, H increases.\n\nTo minimize H, we should avoid moving down or staying if possible, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model when each freeway has a car that covers x=0 at each turn.\n\nx=0 is the position we care about.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, I can compute the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nThe span changes linearly with time.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t_1, where t_1=12.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span depends on direction.\n\nFirst, for a right-moving car: initial head h, tail τ, speed s.\n\nAt T, head = τ + s Δt? No.\n\nFrom the rule: for right-moving, initial span [τ, h] at t_1, then at T, [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, head is the front, so in freeway 1: (head=-48, tail=-83, right, 36)\n\nAt t_1, span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48], since it's moving right, so head is right end.\n\nIn the update: \"Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\" for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, based on the table.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3 have (-48,-83,right,36), freeways 4,5,6 have (-48,-71,right,24), freeway 7 and 8 have three cars each: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, at time T, the span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] where Δt = T - t_1.\n\n0 is in the span if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSince for right-moving, τ < h, so the span is [left end, right end] = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt].\n\n0 in span iff τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but none here.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know for which times T, there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span.\n\nThen, if the player is on that freeway at turn T, collision occurs.\n\nNow, player position: at turn T, y_T is determined by actions.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nStart at T=12, y=0.\n\nWe need to find actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1, such that y_{12+H} =9.\n\nMin H.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k=1 to 8, the set of times T where there is a collision risk, i.e., some car has 0 in span.\n\nSince multiple cars, we need when at least one car covers x=0.\n\nAlso, T is turn number, integer.\n\nΔt = T - 12, integer >=0.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: h=-48, τ=-83, s=36, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 + 36 Δt, -48 + 36 Δt ]\n\n0 in span iff -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nThat is:\n\n-83 + 36 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nSo:\n\n36 Δt <= 83  => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2 since integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 48 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt >= 2? 4/3=1.333, so Δt >= 2 since integer? Let's see:\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so 36 Δt >=48 when Δt >= 2 because 36*1=36<48, 36*2=72>=48.\n\nSimilarly, 36 Δt <=83: 36*2=72<=83, 36*3=108>83, so Δt <=2.\n\nSo for Δt=2, we have 36*2=72, so -83+72= -11, -48+72=24, so span [-11,24], 0 is between -11 and 24, yes.\n\nFor Δt=1: -83+36= -47, -48+36= -12, span [-47,-12], 0 not in, since -12<0.\n\nΔt=0: at t_1, span [-83,-48], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: -83+108=25, -48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=12+2=14, collision possible on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 are identical: same car parameters, so also only at T=14, collision on y=2 and y=3? Freeway k is the y-level.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1, I assume.\n\nThe table says \"Freeway k\", and k from 1 to 8, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nSo for freeway 1 (y=1), collision only at T=14.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 (y=2) same, only T=14.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3) same, only T=14.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (head=-48, tail=-71, right, 24)\n\nh=-48, τ=-71? In the table: \"(-48, -71, right, 24)\"\n\nSo head=-48, tail=-71, s=24.\n\nSpan at T: [ -71 + 24 Δt, -48 + 24 Δt ]\n\n0 in span iff -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-71 + 24 Δt <= 0 => 24 Δt <=71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <= 2\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt => 48 <= 24 Δt => Δt >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only Δt=2.\n\nAt Δt=2: -71+48= -23, -48+48=0, so span [-23,0], so 0 is included, yes collision.\n\nAt Δt=1: -71+24= -47, -48+24= -24, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: -71+72=1, -48+72=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=14 for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same, only T=14 for y=4,5,6? Freeway 4 is y=4.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 all have the same car: (-48,-71,right,24), so for each, only at T=14 collision possible.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) head=48, tail=37, s=4.\n\nBut tail=37, head=48, since right-moving, span at t_1: [37,48]? τ and h, but in the state it's given as (head, tail), so for this car, head=48, tail=37, so initial span [tail, head] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 4 Δt\n\nBut 37 + 4 Δt >=37>0, so left end >=37>0, so 0 cannot be <= left end, so never 0 in span for this car. Similarly for all Δt, since min is 37>0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1, s=4.\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 4 Δt\n\nBut 1 + 4 Δt >=1>0, so left end >0, so 0 not <= left end, impossible. Thus never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35, s=4.\n\nSpan at T: [-35 + 4 Δt, -24 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span iff -35 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 4 Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-35 + 4 Δt <= 0 => 4 Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/4 = 8.75, so Δt <=8\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 + 4 Δt => 24 <= 4 Δt => Δt >= 6\n\nAlso, since -24 + 4 Δt >=0 and -35 + 4 Δt <=0.\n\nSo Δt >=6 and Δt <=8.\n\nFor Δt=6: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=7: -35+28= -7, -24+28=4, span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=8: -35+32= -3, -24+32=8, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: -35+20= -15, -24+20= -4, span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=9: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, at Δt=6,7,8, i.e., T=18,19,20.\n\nNow for freeway 7, since other cars never cover 0, only this third car causes collision at T=18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same as freeway 7, all cars identical, so same collision times: T=18,19,20 for y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 is y=8.\n\nNow summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: collision at T=14\n\n- y=2: collision at T=14\n\n- y=3: collision at T=14\n\n- y=4: collision at T=14\n\n- y=5: collision at T=14\n\n- y=6: collision at T=14  (since freeway 6 same as 4,5)\n\nFreeway 6 has (-48,-71,right,24), same as 4 and 5, so y=6 collision at T=14.\n\n- y=7: collision at T=18,19,20\n\n- y=8: collision at T=18,19,20\n\nFor other times, no collision on any freeway.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 12, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, safe.\n\ny=0 also safe.\n\nThe dangerous turns are when on y=1 to 6 at T=14, or on y=7 or 8 at T=18,19,20.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nSince H is the number of actions to reach y=9, and we start at y=0, after H actions, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nFor each turn T, y_T must not be on a freeway with collision at T, unless y_T not in 1-8, but y=0 and 9 safe.\n\ny_T can be 0 to 9.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nThe player must go through y=1 to 8 to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical points are T=14 and T=18-20.\n\nAt T=14, all y=1 to 6 have collision, so if the player is on y=1,2,3,4,5, or 6 at turn 14, collision occurs.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18,19,20, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=14, we must not be on y=1 to 6 at turn 14.\n\nThat means at turn 14, y_14 must be 0,7,8, or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18,19,20, y_T must not be 7 or 8.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, but we may not be there yet.\n\nNow, we start at turn 12, y=0.\n\nWe need to plan actions.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nTurn 12: start, y=0\n\nAfter action a_12, y_13 = y_12 + Δy_12\n\nThen y_14 = y_13 + Δy_13, and so on.\n\ny_14 must be in {0,7,8,9} to avoid collision at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, for T=18,19,20, if y_T is 7 or 8, collision, so we need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nSince we want to minimize H, we should go up quickly, but we may need to delay or something.\n\nFirst, from turn 12, we can go up or stay or down, but down to y=0 is safe but we need to go up, so probably not down.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, we can go up every turn, so in 9 actions: from turn 12 to 20, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nTurn 12: y=0\n\nAfter a_12: if U, y_13=1; S, y_13=0; D, y_13=0 but y min 0, so D same as S.\n\nThen turn 13: y_13\n\nAfter a_13, y_14\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn the no-wait case: all U actions.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 12: y=0, action U, y_13=1\n\nTurn 13: y=1, action U, y_14=2\n\nBut at turn 14, y_14=2, which is on freeway y=2, and T=14 has collision for y=2, so collision! Not good.\n\nSimilarly, if we start at turn 12, go up to y_13=1, then at turn 13, if we stay, y_14=1, still on y=1 at T=14, collision.\n\nIf we go down at turn 13, y_14=0, which is safe, but we are back to 0.\n\nNot progress.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1-6 at T=14, we need y_14 to be 0,7,8,9.\n\ny=9 might be far.\n\nAt turn 12, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y_14 in {0,7,8,9} in two actions (from turn 12 to 14).\n\nFrom y=0, with two actions, possible y_14:\n\n- If both S: y_13=0, y_14=0\n\n- S then U: y_13=0, y_14=1\n\n- U then S: y_13=1, y_14=1\n\n- U then U: y_13=1, y_14=2\n\n- U then D: y_13=1, y_14=0\n\n- D then anything, but D at y=0 does nothing.\n\nSo possible y_14: 0,1,2\n\nBut we need y_14 in {0,7,8,9}, so only y_14=0 is possible with two actions from start.\n\ny_14=0 can be achieved by: at turn 12, S or D, then y_13=0; then at turn 13, S or D, y_14=0.\n\nOr at turn 12, U, then y_13=1; then at turn 13, D, y_14=0.\n\nSo y_14=0 is possible.\n\nBut y_14=1 or 2 not safe, since in {1,2} which are dangerous at T=14.\n\nWith two actions, we cannot reach y=7,8,9 from y=0, since max increase is 2, to y=2.\n\nSo only choice is to be at y_14=0.\n\nSo we must have y_14=0.\n\nThat means at turn 14, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we also have the later danger at T=18,19,20 on y=7 and 8.\n\nNow, y_14=0.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_14 + something to y=9.\n\ny_14=0 at turn 14.\n\nNow, we need to go up through y=1 to 8.\n\nBut at T=18,19,20, we need to avoid y=7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's see the time from turn 14.\n\nTurn 14 is done, position y=0.\n\nNow, we take actions from turn 14 onwards.\n\nTurn 14: y_14=0, we choose a_14, which sets y_15, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{12+H} =9 for some H.\n\nSince we are at turn 14, y=0, and need to reach y=9, minimal actions from here is 9 up moves, so at least 9 actions, reaching turn 14+9=23, y=9.\n\nBut we need to consider the collision at T=18,19,20 for y=7,8.\n\nT=18,19,20 correspond to turns from start.\n\nt_1=12, so T=18 is Δt=6, etc.\n\nNow from turn 14, time relative.\n\nSet t=14 as new reference, but keep absolute.\n\nTurn 14: y=0\n\nTurn 15: y_15\n\n...\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- At T=18, if y_18=7 or 8, collision\n\n- At T=19, if y_19=7 or 8, collision\n\n- At T=20, if y_20=7 or 8, collision\n\nAlso, no other dangers, since only those times have collisions.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf we go up every turn from turn 14:\n\nTurn 14: y=0, action U, y_15=1\n\nTurn 15: y=1, U, y_16=2\n\nTurn 16: y=2, U, y_17=3\n\nTurn 17: y=3, U, y_18=4\n\nAt turn 18, y_18=4, which is y=4, not 7 or 8, so safe. T=18 collision only for y=7,8.\n\ny=4 is fine.\n\nThen turn 18: y=4, U, y_19=5\n\nTurn 19: y=5, U, y_20=6\n\nTurn 20: y=6, U, y_21=7\n\nBut at turn 20, y_20=6, which is y=6, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nT=20 collision for y=7,8, y=6 is ok.\n\nThen turn 20: y=6, U, y_21=7\n\nNow turn 21: y=7, we need to go up, but at turn 21, T=21, which is not 18,19,20, so no collision on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, turn 22: y=8, if we go U, but let's see.\n\nFrom y_20=6 at turn 20.\n\nAction at turn 20: U, y_21=7\n\nTurn 21: y=7, action U, y_22=8\n\nTurn 22: y=8, action U, y_23=9\n\nNow, at which turns are we on y=7 and y=8.\n\ny_21=7 at turn 21\n\ny_22=8 at turn 22\n\nNow, T=21 and 22 are not 18,19,20, so no collision, since collision only at 18,19,20 for y=7,8.\n\nT=18,19,20 are the only dangerous times.\n\nSo at turn 21 and 22, it's safe.\n\nThen at turn 23, y=9, done.\n\nBut we started from turn 14 at y=0.\n\nIn this sequence, from turn 14: actions U at 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22? Let's list:\n\nTurn 14: y=0, U → y_15=1\n\nTurn 15: y=1, U → y_16=2\n\nTurn 16: y=2, U → y_17=3\n\nTurn 17: y=3, U → y_18=4\n\nTurn 18: y=4, U → y_19=5\n\nTurn 19: y=5, U → y_20=6\n\nTurn 20: y=6, U → y_21=7\n\nTurn 21: y=7, U → y_22=8\n\nTurn 22: y=8, U → y_23=9\n\nNow, at turn 23, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 14 to 22: turns 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22: that's 9 actions.\n\nBut we have to include the actions from turn 12 to 13 to get to turn 14.\n\nEarlier, to have y_14=0, we need actions at turn 12 and 13.\n\nFor example, at turn 12: we can do S or D, but since y=0, D same as S, so S: stay.\n\nThen y_13=0\n\nThen at turn 13: S or D, y_14=0\n\nOr at turn 12: U, y_13=1\n\nThen turn 13: D, y_14=0\n\nIn both cases, we use two actions to stay at y=0 until turn 14.\n\nNow, from turn 14 to 22, 9 actions to go to y=9, reaching at turn 23.\n\nTotal actions: from turn 12 to 22 inclusive? Let's see the turns.\n\nWe need to specify actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=12.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 12+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions at turn 12,13,14,..., up to when?\n\nFrom above, we have actions at turn 12 and 13 to set y_14=0.\n\nThen actions from turn 14 to 22 to go up to y_23=9.\n\nAction at turn 22 sets y_23.\n\nSo actions at turns: 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22\n\nThat's 11 actions: turns 12 to 22 inclusive.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at turn 23, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used two turns to wait at start.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by not waiting.\n\nBut earlier, with two actions, we can only be at y=0,1,2 at turn 14, and only y=0 is safe, so we must have y_14=0, so we must spend at least two turns to be at y=0 at turn 14, meaning we cannot progress in the first two turns.\n\nThus, minimal H must be at least 9 up moves plus the waiting, so at least 11 actions? 9 up moves but we have to start from y=0.\n\nFrom turn 12 to reach y=9 directly with no delay: 9 actions, turn 12 to 20, y_21=9? Turn 12 action to y_13=1, ..., turn 20 action to y_21=9, so after 9 actions, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut in that case, at turn 14, y_14=2 (if start U at 12), which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nThus, we need to delay.\n\nIn the sequence above, with H=11, we reach at turn 23.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y_14=7 or 8, but with two actions from y=0, impossible to reach y=7.\n\nMax y_14=2.\n\nSo y_14 must be 0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen from y_14=0 at turn 14, we go up.\n\nIn the sequence I have, we reach y_23=9 at turn 23.\n\nBut we need to check if during the up moves, we are safe at other times.\n\nIn the sequence from turn 14:\n\ny_15=1, turn 15\n\ny_16=2, turn 16\n\ny_17=3, turn 17\n\ny_18=4, turn 18\n\ny_19=5, turn 19\n\ny_20=6, turn 20\n\ny_21=7, turn 21\n\ny_22=8, turn 22\n\ny_23=9, turn 23\n\nNow, at turn 18,19,20, we have y=4,5,6 respectively, which are not 7 or 8, so no collision.\n\nAt turn 21, y=7, but T=21 not dangerous for y=7.\n\nSimilarly turn 22, y=8, safe.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, from y_14=0, if we go up faster, but we are going up one per turn.\n\nWe could stay or go down, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nSo minimal from here is 9 actions to y=9.\n\nBut total H=11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the later danger by timing.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we can be on y=7 or 8 before or after the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=7 earlier, say before turn 18.\n\nBut from y_14=0, turn 14.\n\nTo reach y=7 at turn 17, for example.\n\ny_14=0\n\nAfter 3 actions: if all U, y_17=3\n\nBut y=3 at turn 17, not 7.\n\nTo reach y=7 at turn 17, we need to increase by 7 in 3 actions? From turn 14 to 17, actions at 14,15,16 set y_15,y_16,y_17.\n\ny_14=0\n\na_14: to y_15\n\na_15: to y_16\n\na_16: to y_17\n\nMax y_17=3 with all U.\n\nCannot reach y=7 by turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to reach y=7 is at turn 21 with all up, as above.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only increase by 1 per turn, so no.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before turn 23.\n\nBut with the constraint that we must have y_14=0, and from there min 9 turns to y=9, so turn 23.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the first part.\n\nAt turn 12: we need to have y_14=0.\n\nOptions:\n\n- At turn 12: S (or D), then turn 13: S (or D), so y_13=0, y_14=0\n\n- Or turn 12: U, then turn 13: D, so y_13=1, y_14=0\n\nIn both cases, we can choose.\n\nTo minimize actions, but both use two actions.\n\nIn the second case, we go to y=1 and back, but it doesn't save time.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the up part, we go directly up.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point we are on a freeway when it has collision, but only at specific times.\n\nFor example, when we go up, at turn 15, y=1, turn 15.\n\nIs there collision on y=1 at turn 15?\n\nFrom earlier, for y=1, collision only at T=14, not at other times.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, only at specific times.\n\nAt turn 15, no collision on any y, since only T=14 for y=1-6 and T=18-20 for y=7-8.\n\nSo at turn 15, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 16, y=2, safe, and so on.\n\nOnly need to avoid the specific dangerous turns.\n\nIn our sequence, it seems fine.\n\nBut we have the later part.\n\nAt turn 20, y_20=6, we go up to y_21=7.\n\nBut at turn 20, T=20, which is dangerous for y=7 and 8, but we are on y=6, not 7 or 8.\n\nThen at turn 21, y=7, T=21, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIs there a problem at turn 21 or 22? No.\n\nBut we reach at turn 23.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 earlier if we start later, but we have to start from turn 12.\n\nAnother thought: we don't necessarily have to be at y=0 at turn 14; we could be at y=7 or 8, but impossible with two actions.\n\ny=9 also impossible.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at turn 14.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in the output, we need the action sequence from turn 12.\n\nNow, for the first two actions, we can choose how to achieve y_14=0.\n\nFor example, one way: at turn 12: S, then turn 13: S\n\nOr turn 12: U, turn 13: D\n\nIn terms of number of actions, same.\n\nPerhaps we can combine with the up moves, but since we have to wait, no saving.\n\nI think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the later danger by being on y=7 or 8 at safe times.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=7 at turn 17, but impossible from y_14=0.\n\ny_14=0, min y_17=3.\n\nMax y_17=3.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=6 or something and wait, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on y=7 or 8 during T=18-20.\n\nT=18,19,20.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at turn 17, but cannot.\n\nEarliest y=7 is turn 21 as above.\n\nAt turn 21, T=21, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be on y=8 or 9 during T=18-20.\n\nBut y=9 safe.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=9 by turn 18.\n\nBut from y_14=0 at turn 14, to y_18=9? Actions at 14,15,16,17 set y_15,y_16,y_17,y_18.\n\nMax y_18=4 with all U.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, to reach by turn 20: y_20=9, need from y_14=0, in 6 actions? From turn 14 to 19 actions set y_15 to y_20.\n\ny_14=0\n\na_14: y_15\n\n...\n\na_19: y_20\n\nWith 6 actions, max y_20=6.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before turn 23 with min up moves.\n\ny_20=6 at best, then need three more to y=9.\n\nSo turn 23 is earliest possible.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for the first part, we need to set y_14=0.\n\nWe can do it in different ways.\n\nFor example, let's choose to stay at turn 12 and 13.\n\nSo turn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nThen y_14=0\n\nThen from turn 14 to 22: all U to go up.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nThen y_23=9.\n\nBut turn 22 action sets y_23=9.\n\nActions from turn 12 to 22: 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from turn t_1=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nAfter last action at turn 22, y_23=9.\n\nBut is there a collision at any point?\n\nAt turn 14: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 15: y=1, but T=15, not dangerous, since only T=14 for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, turn 16: y=2, safe\n\n...\n\nTurn 18: y=4, T=18, but y=4 not dangerous at any time except T=14, which is past.\n\ny=4 collision only at T=14, not at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, turn 19: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 20: y=6, safe\n\nTurn 21: y=7, T=21, not 18-20, so safe\n\nTurn 22: y=8, T=22, safe\n\nTurn 23: y=9, reached.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe could have done turn 12: U, turn 13: D to get to y_14=0, but that might be unnecessary movement.\n\nS is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut the player position is given at (0,0) at turn 12, before action.\n\nThen actions from turn 12 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all S at 12 and 13, then U all the way.\n\nBut at turn 13, if we do S, y_14=0.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up later, but no benefit.\n\nAnother thing: during the up moves, when we are on y=1 to 6, at times other than T=14, it should be safe, which it is.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 and 8 except T=18-20.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at T=21, which is after 20, safe.\n\nT=21>20.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=22.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 with fewer actions by going through y=7 or 8 at safe times only.\n\nBut I don't think we can do better than H=11.\n\nSuppose we go up to some point and wait.\n\nFor example, from start, instead of staying, go up to y=3 or something by turn 13 or so, but at turn 14, if on y=1-6, collision.\n\nMust not be on 1-6 at T=14.\n\nSo only options are y=0,7,8,9 at T=14.\n\ny=7,8,9 unreachable with two actions from y=0.\n\nSo must be y=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow for the action sequence.\n\nIn the first part, instead of S and S, we can do U and D.\n\nBut S and S is simpler.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nWe need to output for each turn from t_1.\n\nt_1=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nBut after action at turn 22, y_23=9.\n\nHow many actions? Turns 12 to 22: 11 turns, H=11.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, but in terms of the turn index.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9)\n\nIn this case, a_{12} to a_{22}, that's 11 actions: t=0 to 10 for the index, H=11.\n\nThen at turn 12+11=23, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write:\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = S\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = S\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 22: a_{22} = U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can have a shorter sequence by avoiding the later wait, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are dangerous only at T=18,19,20, if we can be on y=7 before or after.\n\nBut from y_14=0, we can only reach y=7 at earliest turn 21.\n\nIf we go slower to y=6 or something and wait until after T=20 to go up.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=6 by some turn, then stay until T=20 is past, then go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from y_14=0.\n\nGo up all to y_20=6? y_14=0\n\na_14 U, y_15=1\n\n...\n\na_19 U, y_20=6\n\nAs before.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=6, we can go to y_21=7, etc.\n\nBut same as before, y_23=9.\n\nIf we reach y=6 earlier, but we can't, since min turns to y=6 from y=0 is 6 actions: y_14=0 to y_20=6 with 6 actions? Actions at 14 to 19 set y_15 to y_20.\n\ny_20 with 6 actions from y_14: max y_20=6.\n\nThen y_21=7, y_22=8, y_23=9.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 for one turn, then y_20=6, action S, y_21=6, then U to y_22=7, etc., worse.\n\nSo min is to go directly.\n\nThus the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for the actions at turn 12 and 13, I used S, but we can use other, but S is fine.\n\nIn the output, we need to write it.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars that might cover at other times? But we checked only at T=18,19,20 for them.\n\nFor example, on y=7, the car spans: we have one car that covers from T=18 to 20, others never.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nAnd no other freeways have other times.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nAction sequence:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut to write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and a car on that freeway has its span containing \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- **Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\)**: Collision occurs only at turn \\(T = 14\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = T - 12 = 2\\)).\n- **Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\)**: Collision occurs at turns \\(T = 18, 19, 20\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n- No collisions occur at other turns or on \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Strategy:\n- To avoid collision at \\(T = 14\\), the player must be at \\(y_{14} \\in \\{0, 7, 8, 9\\}\\).\n- From the starting position \\(y_{12} = 0\\), with two actions (at turns 12 and 13), the maximum achievable \\(y_{14}\\) is 2, so \\(y_{14} = 0\\) is the only safe option.\n- Achieving \\(y_{14} = 0\\) requires:\n  - Option 1: Stay at turn 12 (\\(a_{12} = S\\), \\(y_{13} = 0\\)) and stay at turn 13 (\\(a_{13} = S\\), \\(y_{14} = 0\\)).\n  - Option 2: Move up at turn 12 (\\(a_{12} = U\\), \\(y_{13} = 1\\)) and move down at turn 13 (\\(a_{13} = D\\), \\(y_{14} = 0\\)).\n- Option 1 (staying twice) is simpler and used here.\n- From \\(y_{14} = 0\\), the player must reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions at \\(T = 18, 19, 20\\) on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\).\n- The fastest way is to move up every turn starting from turn 14:\n  - At turn 20, \\(y_{20} = 6\\), which is safe since \\(y = 6\\) has no collision at \\(T = 20\\).\n  - At turns 21 and 22, \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are safe because \\(T = 21\\) and \\(T = 22\\) are not collision times for these freeways.\n- After 11 actions (turns 12 to 22), \\(y_{23} = 9\\), reaching the goal.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- Total turns: \\(H = 11\\) (actions from turn 12 to turn 22).\n- Sequence:\n  - Turn 12: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n  - Turn 13: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), ensuring \\(y_{14} = 0\\) (safe from collision at \\(T = 14\\)).\n  - Turns 14 to 22: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y_{23} = 9\\).\n\n### Collision-Free Verification:\n- \\(T = 14\\): \\(y_{14} = 0\\) (safe, not on freeway).\n- \\(T = 15\\): \\(y_{15} = 1\\) (safe, no collision on \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 15\\)).\n- \\(T = 16\\): \\(y_{16} = 2\\) (safe, no collision on \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 16\\)).\n- \\(T = 17\\): \\(y_{17} = 3\\) (safe, no collision on \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 17\\)).\n- \\(T = 18\\): \\(y_{18} = 4\\) (safe, not \\(y = 7\\) or \\(8\\)).\n- \\(T = 19\\): \\(y_{19} = 5\\) (safe, not \\(y = 7\\) or \\(8\\)).\n- \\(T = 20\\): \\(y_{20} = 6\\) (safe, not \\(y = 7\\) or \\(8\\)).\n- \\(T = 21\\): \\(y_{21} = 7\\) (safe, \\(T = 21\\) not collision time for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- \\(T = 22\\): \\(y_{22} = 8\\) (safe, \\(T = 22\\) not collision time for \\(y = 8\\)).\n- \\(T = 23\\): \\(y_{23} = 9\\) (goal reached, safe).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 11\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S \\\\\nTurn 13: S \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only vertical. The horizontal position is always 0.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that covers 0 (the player's horizontal position).\n\nImportant note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T at turn T, and then moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T and checks for collision with cars on that freeway at turn T. Then, after the move, at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1} and checks the cars on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nWe start at turn 14 at (0,0). We need to get to (0,9). Since we are at y=0 and we cannot go below 0 or above 9, we must move upward.\n\nThe cars are given for freeways 1 to 8. Note that at the starting turn (turn 14) we are at y=0, so we don't check for collision until we step onto a freeway (y>=1).\n\nWe have to compute for each freeway the positions of the cars at any future turn. The cars move according to their direction and speed.\n\nCar update:\n- For a left-moving car: the span at time T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? But note: the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: in the example, all cars are right-moving. However, let's check the data: all cars in the given state are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1 to 8, we have:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> right-moving\nFreeway 2: same\nFreeway 3: same\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\nFreeway 5: same\nFreeway 6: same\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\nFreeway 8: same as 7\n\nFor right-moving cars, the update is:\n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). So at time t1, the car spans from tail to head: [tail, head]. Then at time T, it becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, the problem says for right-moving: \n  \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So we must interpret: the first number is head, the second is tail? But the problem says for freeway 7: (48,37,right,4) -> that would mean head=48, tail=37? Then the span at t1 is from 37 to 48? Then as a right-moving car, it moves to the right.\n\nBut note: the problem states the representation as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, head is the front (so larger coordinate) and tail is the rear (smaller). Therefore, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [37,48] for the first car on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway 7: (12,1,right,4) -> [1,12]\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) -> tail=-35, head=-24 -> span [-35,-24]\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, we can compute the span at any turn T (relative to t1=14, so T>=14).\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway y at turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nOur plan: we want to move from y=0 to y=9 as fast as possible, but we must avoid the freeways when they are occupied at 0.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). So the minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves (if we move up every turn). But we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision, which would increase the number of turns.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe'll model the problem as a state-space search: state = (turn, y) and we simulate from turn 14 onward.\n\nThe state: \n  turn: starting at 14 and increasing.\n  y: integer in [0,9]\n\nWe start at (14,0) and goal is any state with y=9 (we can stop as soon as we reach y=9).\n\nBut note: when we are at (turn, y), we are at that turn at position (0,y). If y is between 1 and 8, we must check if at that turn, the freeway y has a car that spans 0.\n\nWe are given the initial state of cars at turn 14. We can compute the position of every car at any turn T.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the span at turn T.\n\nLet delta_t = T - 14.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial head=h, tail=τ at turn 14, speed=s:\n  at turn T: \n      tail_T = τ + s * (T-14)\n      head_T = h + s * (T-14)\n\nThen the span is [tail_T, head_T]. We need to check if 0 is in [tail_T, head_T].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars (though we don't have any) we would have:\n  tail_T = h - s*(T-14)   [but note the representation: for left-moving, the head is at the left? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: initial span [h, τ] and then [h - s*(T-14), τ - s*(T-14)]. So the head is the larger one? But for left-moving, the head would be the front which is at the left? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order. But we don't have left-moving, so we skip.\n\nSo for each freeway, we have a set of cars. For a given freeway y and turn T, we check each car on that freeway: if 0 is between tail_T and head_T (inclusive), then there is a collision if the player is on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute for each freeway (1-8) and for each car, the function that tells for a turn T (>=14) if the car covers 0.\n\n   For a car (h, τ, d, s) at freeway y (but note: the car is fixed on that freeway) and d='right':\n\n      tail_T = τ + s*(T-14)\n      head_T = h + s*(T-14)\n\n      The car covers 0 if: tail_T <= 0 <= head_T.\n\n   But note: for the car on freeway 7: (48,37,right,4) at T=14: \n        tail_14 = 37 + 0 = 37, head_14=48+0=48 -> [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48] -> safe.\n\n   However, as time passes, the car moves to the right. So at T=14, the car is at [37,48]. At T=15: [37+4,48+4] = [41,52] -> still not at 0.\n\n   We note that the cars that are at negative positions at T=14 will eventually move to the right and might cover 0.\n\n   For example, the third car on freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,4) at T=14: \n        tail_14 = -35, head_14 = -24 -> [-35,-24] -> 0 is not in there.\n        At T=15: [-35+4, -24+4] = [-31, -20] -> still negative.\n\n   When will it cover 0? \n        We need: tail_T <= 0 <= head_T\n        -35 + 4*(T-14) <= 0 <= -24 + 4*(T-14)\n\n        Solve the right inequality: 0 <= -24 + 4*(T-14) -> 24 <= 4*(T-14) -> T-14 >= 6 -> T>=20\n        and the left: -35+4*(T-14) <= 0 -> 4*(T-14) <= 35 -> T-14 <= 8.75 -> T<=22.75 -> so T<=22.\n\n        So at T=20,21,22: \n          T=20: tail_20 = -35 + 4*6 = -35+24=-11, head_20=-24+24=0 -> so 0 is included? [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included (at the endpoint).\n          T=21: [-35+4*7=-7, -24+28=4] -> [ -7,4] -> includes 0.\n          T=22: [-35+4*8=-3, -24+32=8] -> includes 0.\n\n        So at T=20,21,22, the third car on freeway 7 covers 0.\n\n   Similarly, the second car on freeway 7: (12,1,right,4) at T=14: [1,12]\n        We need: 1 + 4*(T-14) <= 0 <= 12+4*(T-14) -> but 1+4*(T-14) is at least 1 at T=14, so it's positive. Therefore, it never covers 0? Actually, the car is already to the right of 0 and moving right, so it will never cover 0.\n\n   The first car: (48,37,right,4) is even further right.\n\n   Similarly, for freeway 8: same cars as 7, so same coverage.\n\n   Now, let's look at freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> note: the representation is (head, tail). So head=-48, tail=-83? \n        Then at T=14: span = [tail, head] = [-83, -48] -> negative.\n\n        We need: -83 + 36*(T-14) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-14)\n\n        Solve: \n          Right: 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-14) -> 48 <= 36*(T-14) -> T-14 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ~ 1.33 -> T>=15.33 -> so T>=16\n          Left: -83+36*(T-14) <= 0 -> 36*(T-14) <= 83 -> T-14 <= 83/36 ~ 2.305 -> T<=16.305 -> so T<=16\n\n        Therefore, only T=16: \n          tail_16 = -83+36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n          head_16 = -48+72 = 24\n          So [-11,24] includes 0.\n\n        So at T=16, freeway 1 is blocked.\n\n        What about T=17? \n          tail_17 = -83+36*3 = -83+108=25 -> [25, ...] -> head_17=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] -> doesn't include 0.\n\n        So freeway 1 is blocked only at T=16.\n\n   Similarly, freeway 2 and 3: same as freeway 1 (same car parameters) -> blocked at T=16.\n\n   Freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n        head=-48, tail=-71, speed=24.\n\n        Check when it covers 0:\n          tail_T = -71 + 24*(T-14) <= 0 -> 24*(T-14) <= 71 -> T-14 <= 71/24 ~ 2.958 -> T<=16.958 -> T<=16\n          head_T = -48 + 24*(T-14) >=0 -> 24*(T-14)>=48 -> T-14>=2 -> T>=16\n\n        So at T=16: \n          tail_16 = -71+24*2 = -71+48 = -23\n          head_16 = -48+48 =0 -> so [ -23,0] -> includes 0.\n\n        At T=17: \n          tail_17 = -71+24*3 = -71+72=1 -> [1, ...] -> head_17=-48+72=24 -> [1,24] -> doesn't include 0.\n\n        So freeway 4 is blocked at T=16.\n\n        Similarly, freeway 5 and 6: same -> blocked at T=16.\n\n   Summary of dangerous turns for freeways:\n\n   Freeway 1: T=16\n   Freeway 2: T=16\n   Freeway 3: T=16\n   Freeway 4: T=16\n   Freeway 5: T=16\n   Freeway 6: T=16\n   Freeway 7: T=20,21,22\n   Freeway 8: T=20,21,22\n\n   So the only dangerous turns are 16 and 20,21,22.\n\n   But note: we are starting at turn 14 at y=0.\n\n   We need to get to y=9. The minimal path: 9 moves upward.\n\n   However, if we move upward without waiting, we would be:\n\n      Turn 14: at y=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\n      Turn 15: move U -> y=1 -> we are on freeway 1 at turn 15. Check freeway 1 at turn 15: \n          Freeway1: T=15 -> delta=1: tail_15=-83+36= -47, head_15=-48+36=-12 -> [-47,-12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n      Turn 16: move U -> y=2 -> on freeway2 at turn16: freeway2 is blocked at turn16 -> collision.\n\n   So we cannot do that.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid being on freeways 1-6 at turn16, and freeways 7-8 at turns 20,21,22.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n      Option 1: Wait at y=0 until after turn16? But we are at y=0 at turn14. We can stay at y=0 for a few turns.\n\n      Then we can go up.\n\n      For example:\n\n        Turn14: S -> y=0\n        Turn15: S -> y=0\n        Turn16: S -> y=0 (safe because at y=0, not on freeway) -> then we avoid the danger at turn16 for freeways1-6.\n\n        Then starting from turn17, we can move up.\n\n        How long to get to y=9? We start at turn17 at y=0. We need 9 moves: so we would be at y=9 at turn17+8 = turn25.\n\n        But we have to check the freeways 7 and 8 at turns 20,21,22. \n\n        When we are moving upward:\n\n          Turn17: U -> y=1 -> freeway1 at turn17: we computed freeway1 at turn17: [25,60] -> safe.\n          Turn18: U -> y=2 -> freeway2 at turn18: same as freeway1 at turn17? Actually, freeway2 at turn18: \n                 car: (-48,-83,right,36): \n                 tail_18 = -83+36*(18-14)= -83+36*4 = -83+144=61\n                 head_18 = -48+144=96 -> [61,96] -> safe.\n\n          Similarly, freeway3,4,5,6 at turn17 and beyond: they are beyond 0 and moving right, so safe.\n\n          Now, when we get to freeway7 and 8:\n\n          We will be at:\n            Turn17: y=1\n            Turn18: y=2\n            Turn19: y=3\n            Turn20: y=4 -> freeway4? But note: freeway4 is at y=4? Actually, freeways are by y: \n                    freeway1: y=1\n                    freeway2: y=2\n                    ...\n                    freeway7: y=7\n                    freeway8: y=8\n\n          So when we are at y=4 at turn20, we are on freeway4 -> which is safe (since we are past the danger of freeways1-6 and freeway4 at turn20 is safe).\n\n          The danger for freeway7 and 8 is at turns 20,21,22. But we are not on freeway7 until we get to y=7.\n\n          Let's compute the turn when we are at y=7:\n\n          We start at turn17: y=0\n          turn17: U -> y=1\n          turn18: U -> y=2\n          turn19: U -> y=3\n          turn20: U -> y=4\n          turn21: U -> y=5\n          turn22: U -> y=6\n          turn23: U -> y=7 -> at turn23 we are on freeway7.\n\n          But the danger for freeway7 is at turns20,21,22. At turn23, freeway7: \n            For the third car: at turn23: \n                tail_23 = -35 + 4*(23-14) = -35+4*9 = -35+36=1\n                head_23 = -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\n          Similarly, freeway8 at turn24 (when we are at y=8) would be:\n                turn24: we move to y=8 -> so at turn24 we are on freeway8.\n                For freeway8: same as freeway7, so at turn24: \n                    third car: tail_24=-35+4*10=5, head_24=-24+40=16 -> [5,16] -> safe.\n\n          Then turn25: U -> y=9 -> goal.\n\n          So total turns: from turn14 to turn25: that's 12 turns? But note: we start at turn14 and we take actions at turn14,15,...,24 (11 actions) and then at turn25 we are at y=9? \n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            Turn14: S (y=0)\n            Turn15: S (y=0)\n            Turn16: S (y=0)\n            Turn17: U (y=1)\n            Turn18: U (y=2)\n            Turn19: U (y=3)\n            Turn20: U (y=4)\n            Turn21: U (y=5)\n            Turn22: U (y=6)\n            Turn23: U (y=7)\n            Turn24: U (y=8)\n            Turn25: U (y=9) -> we reach at turn25.\n\n          But the problem: we are to output the actions from turn14 to the last action that gets us to y=9 at the next state. So we take H actions and then at the next state (after H actions) we are at y=9.\n\n          We start at (14,0). After 11 actions (from turn14 to turn24) we are at (14+11=25, y=9). So H=11.\n\n          However, we must check if we are safe at every step:\n\n            Turn14: at (14,0) -> safe (not on freeway)\n            Turn15: at (15,0) -> safe\n            Turn16: at (16,0) -> safe\n            Turn17: at (17,1) -> freeway1: at turn17: car: [-83+36*(17-14)= -83+108=25, -48+108=60] -> [25,60] -> safe.\n            Turn18: at (18,2) -> freeway2: same as freeway1 at turn17? Actually, freeway2: same car parameters: at turn18: [-83+36*4=61, -48+144=96] -> safe.\n            Turn19: at (19,3) -> freeway3: same: [-83+36*5=97, -48+180=132] -> safe.\n            Turn20: at (20,4) -> freeway4: car (-48,-71,right,24) at turn20: \n                   tail_20 = -71+24*(20-14)= -71+24*6= -71+144=73\n                   head_20=-48+144=96 -> safe.\n            Turn21: at (21,5) -> freeway5: same as freeway4: [-71+24*7=97, -48+168=120] -> safe.\n            Turn22: at (22,6) -> freeway6: same -> safe.\n            Turn23: at (23,7) -> freeway7: \n                   car1: (48,37,right,4): at turn23: [37+4*9=73, 48+36=84] -> safe.\n                   car2: (12,1,right,4): [1+36=37, 12+36=48] -> safe.\n                   car3: (-24,-35,right,4): [-35+4*9=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not included).\n            Turn24: at (24,8) -> freeway8: same as freeway7 at turn24: \n                   car1: [37+4*10=77, 48+40=88]\n                   car2: [1+40=41, 12+40=52]\n                   car3: [-35+40=5, -24+40=16] -> safe.\n            Then at turn25: we move to y=9 -> and we are done.\n\n          So this sequence is safe.\n\n          But is there a faster way? We used 11 actions. The minimal without waiting is 9, but we had to wait 3 turns (at y=0). So total 12 states? Actually, we have 11 actions and 12 states (from turn14 to turn25).\n\n          Can we do with 10 actions? That would mean we reach at turn24.\n\n          We start at turn14: y=0.\n          We need to be at y=9 at turn24 (after 10 actions: from turn14 to turn23, then at turn24 the state is y=9).\n\n          How? We must move up 9 times and have one extra action that is not up? Or we can wait less.\n\n          Alternatively, we might avoid the freeway1-6 at turn16 by not being on them at that turn without waiting the whole turn16 at y=0. For example, we could be at y=0 at turn16, but then we must have taken at least one step? \n\n          Actually, we started at y=0 at turn14. We can:\n\n            Option 2: \n              Turn14: U -> y=1 (turn15: at y=1) -> safe at turn15 (as we computed: freeway1 at turn15: [-47,-12] -> safe)\n              Turn15: U -> y=2 (turn16: at y=2) -> but at turn16, freeway2 is blocked -> collision.\n\n          So that doesn't work.\n\n          Option 3: \n              Turn14: U -> y=1 (turn15: safe)\n              Turn15: S -> stay at y=1 at turn16? -> then at turn16, we are on freeway1 -> and freeway1 is blocked at turn16 -> collision.\n\n          Option 4: \n              Turn14: U -> y=1 (safe at turn15)\n              Turn15: D -> back to y=0 at turn16 -> safe (because at turn16 we are at y=0, not on freeway). Then we avoid the collision.\n\n          Then we can proceed upward from turn16 onward.\n\n          Let's see:\n\n            Turn14: U -> at turn15: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn15: [-47,-12] -> safe)\n            Turn15: D -> at turn16: y=0 -> safe\n            Turn16: U -> at turn17: y=1 -> freeway1 at turn17: [25,60] -> safe.\n            Then we continue upward:\n\n            Turn17: U -> y=2 (turn18) -> freeway2: at turn18: [61,96] -> safe.\n            Turn18: U -> y=3 (turn19) -> freeway3: [97,132] -> safe.\n            Turn19: U -> y=4 (turn20) -> freeway4: at turn20: [73,96] -> safe.\n            Turn20: U -> y=5 (turn21) -> freeway5: safe.\n            Turn21: U -> y=6 (turn22) -> freeway6: safe.\n            Turn22: U -> y=7 (turn23) -> freeway7: [1,12] for the third car? Actually at turn23: \n                   car3: tail_23=-35+4*(23-14)= -35+36=1, head_23=-24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not included).\n            Turn23: U -> y=8 (turn24) -> freeway8: at turn24: car3: [5,16] -> safe.\n            Turn24: U -> y=9 (turn25) -> done.\n\n          Total actions: from turn14 to turn24: 11 actions? \n            Actions: \n              Turn14: U\n              Turn15: D\n              Turn16: U\n              Turn17: U\n              ... \n              Turn24: U -> that's 11 actions? \n            But we started at turn14 and we take 11 actions: turn14,15,...,24 -> then at turn25 we are at y=9.\n\n          How many moves? 11 moves. Same as the previous plan.\n\n          But we did an extra down move. However, we started moving earlier and then backed off.\n\n          Alternatively, we can try to be at y=7 and y=8 at turns that avoid the danger (turns 20,21,22). The danger is at turns20,21,22 for freeways7 and 8. So we must avoid being on freeway7 at turns20,21,22 and freeway8 at turns20,21,22.\n\n          We can also consider going faster: we can move up twice and then wait? \n\n          Since we have a long gap between turn16 and turn20, we can move up without waiting at y=0 for 3 turns. But the above two plans both take 11 actions.\n\n          Is there a way to do 10 actions? That would require 10 moves and we start at turn14 and end at turn24 (state at turn24: y=9). \n\n          We must be at y=9 at turn24. We start at y=0 at turn14. We have 10 moves: we must move up 9 times and then one extra move must be a down? But then we wouldn't get to 9.\n\n          Actually, we must have exactly 9 up moves to go from 0 to 9. So any sequence that has 9 up moves and any number of down or stay moves. The minimal number of actions is 9, but we saw we cannot do 9 because of the collision at turn16.\n\n          For 10 actions: we have 9 up moves and 1 extra move (which must be a down or a stay). But if we do a down, then we have to compensate with an extra up, so 10 up and 1 down? That would be 11 moves? \n\n          Actually, we need net +9. Each up is +1, down is -1, stay is 0.\n\n          So if we do U: 9 times, D: d times, S: s times, then we require: 9 - d = 9 -> d=0. And s can be arbitrary. But then the total moves = 9+s. To have 10 moves, we require s=1. So we must have 9 U and 1 S.\n\n          So we can have a sequence with 9 U and 1 S. The S can be at any time.\n\n          We need to avoid collisions. We must not be on freeways1-6 at turn16, and freeways7-8 at turns20,21,22.\n\n          We start at turn14: y=0.\n\n          We have 10 actions: 9 U and 1 S.\n\n          We must be at y=9 at the state after the 10th action (turn24).\n\n          The states:\n\n            turn14: y0=0\n            turn15: y1 = y0 + a0\n            ...\n            turn24: y10 = y9 + a9 -> must be 9.\n\n          And we know: y10 = 0 + (number of U - number of D) = 9 (since we have 9 U and 0 D, and 1 S: so y10=9).\n\n          So we have to use 9 U and 1 S.\n\n          Now, we must avoid:\n\n            At turn16 (which is the state at the beginning of turn16? Actually, the state at the end of the action at turn15 is the state for turn16? \n\n          Let me clarify: \n\n            At turn t, we are at state (t, y_t). Then we choose action a_t, and then we move to state (t+1, y_{t+1}).\n\n          So when we say \"at turn T\", we are at state (T, y_T). Then we take action a_T and move to (T+1, y_{T+1}).\n\n          The collision check is at the state (T, y_T): if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\n          We are concerned about:\n\n            turn16: y_16 must not be in {1,2,3,4,5,6} (because freeways1-6 are blocked at turn16)\n            turn20: y_20 must not be 7 or 8\n            turn21: y_21 must not be 7 or 8\n            turn22: y_22 must not be 7 or 8\n\n          How can we arrange the 9 U and 1 S?\n\n          We need to be at y=9 at turn24.\n\n          We can use the S to avoid being at a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\n          For example, we can use the S at turn16: then we would be at y_16 = y_15, and then we don't move at turn16. So we can be at y_16= some value that is safe. The safe values at turn16 are: \n            y=0: safe (not freeway)\n            y=7: but freeway7 is safe at turn16? \n                freeway7 at turn16: \n                  car1: [37+4*(16-14)=37+8=45, 48+8=56] -> safe.\n                  car2: [1+8=9,12+8=20] -> safe.\n                  car3: [-35+8=-27, -24+8=-16] -> safe.\n            y=8: similarly safe at turn16.\n            y=9: safe (goal, but we are not there yet).\n\n          But we start at y0=0. We have 15 moves to get to turn16? Actually:\n\n            turn14: action0 -> state at turn15: y1\n            turn15: action1 -> state at turn16: y2\n\n          So at turn16, we are at y2 (after 2 actions).\n\n          We have only 2 actions so far. The maximum we can get is y2=2 (if we do U,U). But then we are at y=2 at turn16 -> which is freeway2 -> blocked -> collision.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            turn14: U -> y1=1 (at turn15) -> then at turn15: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn15: safe (as computed: [-47,-12] -> safe)\n            turn15: S -> then at turn16: y2=1 -> freeway1 at turn16: blocked -> collision.\n\n          Or:\n\n            turn14: U -> y1=1 (safe at turn15)\n            turn15: U -> then at turn16: y2=2 -> blocked.\n\n          So we cannot be at y>=1 at turn16 without being on a freeway that is blocked.\n\n          Therefore, the only safe y at turn16 is 0.\n\n          So we must be at y=0 at turn16.\n\n          How? \n\n            We start at turn14: y=0.\n            turn14: we do S -> then at turn15: y=0.\n            turn15: we do S -> then at turn16: y=0.\n\n          Then we have 8 moves left (from turn16 to turn23) to get to y=9? But we have to do 9 U and we already used 0 U. So we have 9 U to do in 8 moves? That is impossible.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            turn14: we do nothing? But we have to use 9 U and 1 S. We have 10 actions.\n\n          We must be at y=0 at turn16. \n\n          The state at turn16: y_16 = 0.\n\n          How to achieve that? \n\n            We start at turn14: y14=0.\n            After turn14: action a14 -> y15 = y14 + delta(a14)\n            After turn15: action a15 -> y16 = y15 + delta(a15) = 0.\n\n          So we require: \n            y15 + delta(a15) = 0.\n\n          And y15 = 0 + delta(a14).\n\n          So: delta(a14) + delta(a15) = 0.\n\n          Possibilities:\n            a14 = U (+1), a15 = D (-1) -> then y16=0.\n            a14 = D (-1), a15 = U (+1) -> but we start at y=0: if we do D at turn14, we go to y=0 (because y must be >=0) -> so y15=0, then a15=U -> y16=1 -> not 0.\n            a14 = S, a15 = S -> then y16=0.\n            a14 = S, a15 = D -> then y15=0, y16=0-1 -> but then y16 would be -1 -> not allowed, so it becomes 0? Actually, the rule: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and do D, we stay at 0.\n\n          So the safe options for (a14, a15) to get y16=0:\n\n            (U, D): y15=1, then D -> y16=0 (but note: we are at freeway1 at turn15? \n                turn15: state (15,1) -> freeway1: at turn15: we computed [-47,-12] -> safe. Then at turn16: we do D -> then state at turn16: (16,0) -> safe.\n\n            (S, S): then we never leave 0.\n\n            (S, D): then at turn15: state (15,0) -> safe. Then D: but then we try to go below 0 -> so it becomes 0. Then state at turn16: (16,0) -> safe.\n\n            (D, U): not possible because at turn14: D from 0 -> becomes 0. Then at turn15: U -> becomes 1 -> then at turn16: 1 -> which is not 0.\n\n            (D, S): then y15=0, y16=0.\n\n          So we have several options to be at y=0 at turn16: \n            Option A: S, S\n            Option B: U, D\n            Option C: S, D\n            Option D: D, S\n\n          But note: we have to use exactly 9 U and 1 S in the entire 10 actions. \n\n          Option A: S at turn14 and S at turn15: then we have 8 moves left (turn16 to turn23) to do 9 U and 1 S? -> but we already used 2 S, and we need one more S? Then total S: 3, U:9 -> total actions: 12? But we are only allowed 10 actions. \n\n          Actually, we are planning 10 actions: turn14 to turn23.\n\n          We are to do 10 actions: 9 U and 1 S.\n\n          So we cannot do two S in the first two moves? \n\n          Therefore, only Option B: U and then D: that uses no S? But we need one S somewhere.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn14: U -> uses one U\n            turn15: D -> uses one D (so net 0 so far)\n            Then from turn16 to turn23: we have 8 moves. We need 9 U and 1 S? That would be 9 U and 1 S in 8 moves? Impossible.\n\n          Alternatively, we do:\n\n            turn14: U (U1)\n            turn15: D (D1) -> net 0 at turn16: y=0.\n            Then we have 8 moves: we need 9 more U and 1 S? That's 10 moves in total? But we only have 8 moves. \n\n          Total moves: 10 actions: \n            turn14: U\n            turn15: D\n            turn16 to turn23: 8 actions -> total 10 actions.\n\n          And we need 9 U and 1 S. So in the 8 actions from turn16 to turn23, we must have 8 U? Because we have already used 1 U and 1 D, so we need 8 more U to make total 9 U, and 0 more D, and then we need one S -> so 8 U and 1 S in 8 moves: that's 9 moves? 8 U and 1 S is 9 actions? \n\n          We have 8 moves: we can do 8 U -> that would be 8 U, so total U: 1 (from turn14) + 8 = 9, and total D: 1 (from turn15). And no S? But we need one S. \n\n          So we cannot get exactly 9 U and 1 S if we do U and D at the beginning? \n\n          We must use the S in the remaining 8 moves. Then we do 7 U and 1 S in the last 8 moves? Then total U: 1 (first) +7 =8 -> not enough.\n\n          Therefore, the only option to be at y=0 at turn16 and use exactly 9 U and 1 S is to do:\n\n            turn14: S (one S)\n            turn15: S? -> but then we have used two S, but we only need one S -> then we have 8 moves left and we need 9 U -> impossible.\n\n          So we cannot achieve 10 actions? \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid being at freeways7-8 at turns20,21,22 by timing differently. But we also have to avoid freeways1-6 at turn16.\n\n          But we already see that we must be at y=0 at turn16 to avoid freeways1-6. And then we have to climb 9 levels in 8 moves? impossible.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 11.\n\n          We have two sequences of 11 actions:\n\n          Sequence 1 (all safe):\n\n            Turn14: S\n            Turn15: S\n            Turn16: S\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U   -> then at turn25: y=9.\n\n          Sequence 2:\n\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: D\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U   -> then at turn25: y=9.\n\n          But note: in sequence 2, at turn16: we do U -> then at turn17: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn17: [25,60] -> safe). Then we do 8 U in a row.\n\n          However, we need to check freeway7 and freeway8:\n\n            We will be at freeway7 at turn23: \n                turn23: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn23: car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n            freeway8 at turn24: [5,16] -> safe.\n\n          So both sequences are safe.\n\n          But which one has minimal H? Both have H=11.\n\n          However, the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. H is the number of actions. So both have H=11.\n\n          We can output either. But let's see if we can find a sequence with H=10? We just argued it's impossible.\n\n          Therefore, we choose one.\n\n          Let's choose sequence 2 because it starts moving earlier and might be more natural.\n\n          Sequence 2:\n\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: D\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U\n\n          But wait: we have 11 moves? And we reach y=9 at turn25. \n\n          However, we must check the state at every turn:\n\n            Turn14: start at (14,0)\n            After action at turn14: U -> then at turn15: (15,1) -> check: freeway1 at turn15: [-83+36= -47, -48+36=-12] -> safe.\n            Turn15: action D -> then at turn16: (16,0) -> safe (not freeway)\n            Turn16: action U -> then at turn17: (17,1) -> freeway1: [-83+36*3= -83+108=25, -48+108=60] -> safe.\n            Turn17: U -> turn18: (18,2) -> freeway2: same as freeway1 at turn17? Actually, freeway2: same parameters: [-83+36*4=61, -48+144=96] -> safe.\n            Turn18: U -> turn19: (19,3) -> freeway3: same: [-83+36*5=97, -48+180=132] -> safe.\n            Turn19: U -> turn20: (20,4) -> freeway4: [-71+24*6= -71+144=73, -48+144=96] -> safe.\n            Turn20: U -> turn21: (21,5) -> freeway5: same as freeway4: [-71+24*7=97, -48+168=120] -> safe.\n            Turn21: U -> turn22: (22,6) -> freeway6: same -> safe.\n            Turn22: U -> turn23: (23,7) -> freeway7: \n                   car1: [37+4*9=37+36=73, 48+36=84] -> safe.\n                   car2: [1+36=37, 12+36=48] -> safe.\n                   car3: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> safe.\n            Turn23: U -> turn24: (24,8) -> freeway8: \n                   car1: [37+4*10=77, 48+40=88]\n                   car2: [1+40=41, 12+40=52]\n                   car3: [-35+40=5, -24+40=16] -> safe.\n            Turn24: U -> turn25: (25,9) -> goal.\n\n          So it is safe.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do sequence 1:\n\n            Turn14: S -> turn15: (15,0)\n            Turn15: S -> turn16: (16,0)\n            Turn16: S -> turn17: (17,0) -> but wait, we are at turn17: y=0 -> safe.\n            Then we do 9 U from turn17 to turn25? But we only have 8 moves from turn17 to turn24? \n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            Turn14: S -> state at turn15: (15,0)\n            Turn15: S -> state at turn16: (16,0)\n            Turn16: S -> state at turn17: (17,0)\n            Turn17: U -> state at turn18: (18,1)\n            ...\n            We need to do 9 U. So:\n\n            Turn17: U -> 1\n            Turn18: U -> 2\n            Turn19: U -> 3\n            Turn20: U -> 4\n            Turn21: U -> 5\n            Turn22: U -> 6\n            Turn23: U -> 7\n            Turn24: U -> 8\n            Then we need one more U to get to 9? But we have used 9 actions? \n\n          Total actions: \n            Turn14,15,16: 3 S\n            Turn17 to 24: 8 U -> total 11 actions? Then at turn25: state (25,8) -> and then we are not at 9.\n\n          Actually, after the 11th action (at turn24) we are at y=8. Then we would need a 12th action? \n\n          Let me count:\n\n            We start at turn14: state (14,0)\n            After turn14: state15 = (15,0) -> after S\n            After turn15: state16 = (16,0)\n            After turn16: state17 = (17,0)\n            After turn17: state18 = (18,1) -> U\n            After turn18: state19 = (19,2)\n            After turn19: state20 = (20,3)\n            After turn20: state21 = (21,4)\n            After turn21: state22 = (22,5)\n            After turn22: state23 = (23,6)\n            After turn23: state24 = (24,7)\n            After turn24: state25 = (25,8) -> we need to get to 9.\n\n          So we need one more U at turn25? Then we reach at turn26: y=9. That would be 12 actions.\n\n          But wait, we did 3 S and 8 U -> 11 actions. Then we need a 12th action to go from 8 to 9.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Turn14: S\n            Turn15: S\n            Turn16: S\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U   -> then at turn25: y=8? \n\n          How? We started at 0 at turn17. Then 7 U moves: turn17:1, turn18:2, turn19:3, turn20:4, turn21:5, turn22:6, turn23:7, turn24:8 -> then we need one more U to get to 9.\n\n          So we need 9 U moves. Therefore, we must do 9 U moves after the waiting. So we need 3 S and 9 U -> 12 actions.\n\n          Then the state at turn25: we are at y=8. Then we do the 12th action at turn25: U -> then at turn26: y=9.\n\n          So sequence1 would be 12 actions? \n\n          But in sequence1 we did 3 S and then 9 U -> 12 actions. Then H=12.\n\n          However, in sequence2 we did 11 actions and reached at turn25.\n\n          Therefore, sequence2 is better (H=11).\n\n          So we choose sequence2.\n\n          But note: in sequence2, we did 11 actions: 10 U and 1 D? \n\n          Count of U: \n            turn14: U\n            turn16: U\n            turn17: U\n            ... until turn24: U -> that's 10 U? \n\n          And one D at turn15. So net: 10 U - 1 D = 9? \n\n          Yes: 10 U and 1 D -> net +9.\n\n          So we have:\n\n            turn14: U -> count=1\n            turn15: D -> count=0\n            turn16: U -> count=1\n            turn17: U -> count=2\n            turn18: U -> count=3\n            turn19: U -> count=4\n            turn20: U -> count=5\n            turn21: U -> count=6\n            turn22: U -> count=7\n            turn23: U -> count=8\n            turn24: U -> count=9\n\n          So we have 9 U and 1 D, and 0 S? But the problem allows actions in {U, D, S}. And we used U and D.\n\n          And we reached y=9 at turn25.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: D\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U\n\n          This is 11 actions.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=11.\n\n          However, is there a sequence with H=10? We argued no, because we must be at y=0 at turn16 and then we cannot climb 9 levels in 8 moves? \n\n          But wait: we have 10 actions. We can do 9 U and 1 S. And we can be at y=0 at turn16 by doing:\n\n            turn14: U -> y15=1\n            turn15: D -> y16=0\n\n          Then we have 8 moves (turn16 to turn23) to do 7 U and 1 S? Then total U: 1 (turn14) + 7 = 8 -> not enough.\n\n          Alternatively, we do:\n\n            turn14: U -> y15=1\n            turn15: D -> y16=0\n            Then from turn16 to turn23: we do 8 U -> then total U: 1+8=9, and total D:1 -> net 8? -> y at turn24: 0 + 9 (from U) -1 (from D) = 8.\n\n          Then we need one more move? \n\n          So we see that 10 actions are not enough. Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n          We output the sequence for sequence2.\n\n          However, note that the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n          We found H=11 and a sequence.\n\n          Let me write the answer:\n\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: D\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U\n\n          But wait: at turn24 we are at y=8, then we do U to go to y=9 at turn25. So the last action is at turn24.\n\n          We started at turn14 and did 11 actions: from turn14 to turn24.\n\n          The sequence is for t from 14 to 24.\n\n          Format:\n\n            Turn14: a_{14}\n            Turn15: a_{15}\n            ...\n            Turn24: a_{24}\n\n          And H=11.\n\n          But note: the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Here t1=14, so t from 0 to 10 (since H-1=10) -> 11 actions.\n\n          So we write:\n\n            Turn14: U\n            Turn15: D\n            Turn16: U\n            Turn17: U\n            Turn18: U\n            Turn19: U\n            Turn20: U\n            Turn21: U\n            Turn22: U\n            Turn23: U\n            Turn24: U\n\n          This is the answer.\n\n          However, let me double-check the freeway7 at turn23 and freeway8 at turn24: we already did and it is safe.\n\n          But note: at turn23 we are at y=7: freeway7. We computed the third car at turn23: [1,12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n          Similarly, at turn24: y=8: freeway8: third car: [5,16] -> safe.\n\n          And we never are on freeways1-6 at turn16? \n\n          At turn16: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\n          And at turn17: freeway1: safe.\n\n          So we are good.\n\n          Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: D\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: U\n}\n\nBut note: we have 11 lines, which is H=11.\n\nAlternatively, we could have done the sequence that uses S at the beginning and then 9 U, but that would take 12 actions. So we choose the one with 11.\n\nHowever, let me check if there is a sequence with 11 that uses a stay? \n\nFor example, we could do:\n\n  Turn14: U\n  Turn15: D\n  Turn16: S   -> then at turn17: y=0? \n  Then we have 8 moves to get to 9: we need 9 U? so we do 9 U in 8 moves? impossible.\n\nSo we stick with the above.\n\nWe are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving up initially, then down to avoid the dangerous turn 16 on freeways 1-6, and then moving up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\n- At turn 14, moving up to \\(y = 1\\) is safe because freeway 1 at turn 15 is clear (car span \\([-47, -12]\\) does not include 0).\n- At turn 15, moving down to \\(y = 0\\) avoids freeways 1-6 at turn 16, which are dangerous (cars span 0 at turn 16).\n- From turn 16 onwards, moving up each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 25. Freeways 1-6 are safe after turn 16 (cars have moved past 0), and freeways 7-8 are safe at turns 23 and 24 (car spans at turn 23 for \\(y=7\\) are \\([73,84]\\), \\([37,48]\\), \\([1,12]\\); at turn 24 for \\(y=8\\) are \\([77,88]\\), \\([41,52]\\), \\([5,16]\\); none include 0).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: D\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: U\n```\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn14: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn15: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn16: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn17: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn18: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn19: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn20: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn21: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn22: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn23: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn24: U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=16, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. Each freeway has cars with positions given at turn t=16. For each car, I have the head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left or right moving, but in the span notation, it's given with head and tail.\n\nLet me decode the car states.\n\nFor freeways 1,2,3: each has one car: (24, -11, right, 36). Since it's right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]. Head h=24, tail τ=-11, speed s=36, direction right.\n\nIn the update rule for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all seem right-moving except I should check freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4) all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: each has (0,-23,right,24)\n\nAnd freeway 1,2,3: (24,-11,right,36)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, I think. Direction is given as \"right\" for all.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway. That is, if the car covers position x=0 at time T.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so when moving, at each turn, the player is at some y-coordinate, and we need that at that turn, for the freeway y_t, position x=0 is not occupied by any car on that row.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about the freeway you are currently on at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T, and you perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter action a_T, you move to y_{T+1} at the beginning of turn T+1, I assume.\n\nThe collision condition is at turn T, you are on y_T, and if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThe update: at turn T, position y_T, then you choose action, which sets y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision check is at the current turn, for the current position.\n\nSo, for turn T, when you are at y_T, we check if on freeway y_T, at time T, is there a car covering x=0.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nIf you move to a different y, you don't check the new y until the next turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t=16, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, as per avoiding collisions on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe initial position is (0, y_{t1}) which is (0,0) at t=16.\n\ny=0 might be safe, as it's not a freeway? But the collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8.\"\n\nAnd the player position is given as (0, y_t), with y_t from 0 to 9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe zones or something.\n\ny=9 is the target, and y=0 is start.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nCollision only when on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that at that turn, for freeway y_T, x=0 is not covered by any car.\n\nOtherwise, no issue.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nActions: U (up +1), D (down -1), S (stay same y).\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nSo from y=0, I can go to y=1 with U, or stay at 0 with S, but not down since y=0 min.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, I can go down or stay, but not up.\n\nTarget is to reach y=9.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0 at t=16, and I want to reach y=9, the minimal number of turns would be at least 9 if I always go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient, so probably I should go up as much as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each turn.\n\nCars move with constant speed, and we have their positions at t=16.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to consider all cars on that freeway.\n\nLet’s list the freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 24, tail -11, right, speed 36.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-16), h + s(T-16)] for right-moving, but τ and h given.\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nFor right-moving, at time T, position: left end is τ + s(T-16), right end is h + s(T-16).\n\nSince it's moving right, the head is the right end, tail is left end? In the notation, for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36). Head 24, tail -11. Since right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller, so at t=16, span is from -11 to 24.\n\nThen at time T, since right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-16), h + s(T-16)] = [-11 + 36(T-16), 24 + 36(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nx=0 is covered if the span includes 0, i.e., if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span)\n\nSince span is [left, right] with left <= right.\n\nFor right-moving, left = τ + s(T-t), right = h + s(T-t)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow for freeway 1: τ = -11, h=24, s=36, t=16\n\nSo at time T, left = -11 + 36(T-16)\n\nRight = 24 + 36(T-16)\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right\n\nSo -11 + 36(T-16) <= 0 <= 24 + 36(T-16)\n\nSince left <= right always.\n\nNow, 0 <= right: 0 <= 24 + 36(T-16) which is true for all T >=16 since 24>0.\n\nSimilarly, left <=0: -11 + 36(T-16) <= 0\n\nSo 36(T-16) <= 11\n\nT-16 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo T-16 <= 0 since T integer? T is turn, integer.\n\nT-16 <= floor(11/36) = 0 since 11/36<1.\n\nSo T-16 <=0, so for T=16, left = -11 +0 = -11 <=0, right=24>0, so 0 in span? Let's see.\n\nAt T=16, left = -11 +36(0) = -11, right=24, so -11 <=0<=24, yes, 0 is covered.\n\nBut at T=16, for freeway 1, is there a car at x=0?\n\nThe player is at y=0 at t=16, not on freeway, so no collision yet.\n\nBut for future turns.\n\nFor freeway 1, left <=0 when -11 +36(T-16) <=0\n\n36(T-16) <=11\n\nT-16 <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so for T=16, T-16=0, left=-11<=0\n\nFor T=17, T-16=1, left= -11+36=25>0, so left=25>0, so 0 not in span since min is 25>0.\n\nSimilarly, right=24+36=60>0, but min is 25>0, so 0 not covered for T>=17.\n\nAt T=16: left=-11, right=24, 0 in between.\n\nT=17: left= -11+36=25, right=24+36=60, both >0, 0 not covered.\n\nT=18: left=25+36=61, etc., all larger.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car covers x=0 only at T=16.\n\nBut at T=16, player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no issue.\n\nFor other turns, no coverage.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 are identical: same car, so same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: (24,-11,right,36) same as 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nSo for y=1,2,3, car covers x=0 only at t=16, which is past, and since player not on them, no problem.\n\nNow freeway 4: (0,-23,right,24)\n\nHead=0, tail=-23, right, s=24.\n\nAt T=16, span: left = τ + s(T-16) = -23 +24(0) = -23\n\nRight = h + s(T-16) = 0 +0 =0\n\nSo span [-23,0] at T=16, so 0 covered.\n\nAt T=17: left = -23 +24(1) = -23+24=1\n\nRight = 0 +24=24\n\nSo [1,24], 0 not covered.\n\nT=18: [25,48], etc.\n\nSo for freeway 4, car at x=0 only at T=16.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nAll with speed 4.\n\nAt time T, for each car:\n\nFirst car: head=56, tail=45, right, s=4\n\nAt T=16, span [45,56]\n\nAt T, left = 45 + 4(T-16)\n\nRight = 56 + 4(T-16)\n\n0 covered if left <=0 <= right\n\nLeft =45 +4(T-16) >=45>0 for T>=16, so always left>0, so 0 never covered for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=20, tail=9, right, s=4\n\nAt T, left =9 +4(T-16)\n\nRight=20+4(T-16)\n\nLeft min at T=16: 9>0, so always left>=9>0, so 0 never covered.\n\nThird car: head=-16? head=-16, tail=-27, right, s=4\n\nHead is -16, tail -27.\n\nSince right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -16 > -27, yes.\n\nAt T=16, span: left=τ + s(0) = -27, right=h + s(0) = -16\n\nSo [-27,-16], both negative, 0 not covered.\n\nAt T, left = -27 +4(T-16)\n\nRight = -16 +4(T-16)\n\n0 covered if left <=0 <= right\n\nNow, left <=0: -27 +4(T-16) <=0 => 4(T-16) <=27 => T-16 <= 27/4=6.75, so T-16 <=6 for integer.\n\nRight >=0: -16 +4(T-16) >=0 => 4(T-16) >=16 => T-16 >=4\n\nSo when T-16 >=4 and T-16 <=6, i.e., T=20,21,22? Let's see.\n\nSet k = T-16\n\nLeft <=0: -27 +4k <=0 => 4k <=27 => k <=6.75, so k<=6\n\nRight >=0: -16 +4k >=0 => 4k >=16 => k>=4\n\nSo for k=4,5,6\n\nThat is T=20,21,22\n\nAt these times, 0 covered for this car on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4), so same as freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8 has identical cars, so same coverage: at T=20,21,22, x=0 covered.\n\nNow, for other freeways, we have:\n\ny=1,2,3: only covered at T=16, not relevant for future.\n\ny=4,5,6: covered only at T=16.\n\ny=7 and 8: covered at T=20,21,22.\n\nNow, y=1,2,3,4,5,6 have no future coverage at x=0, except at T=16 which is past.\n\nFor y=7 and 8, dangerous at T=20,21,22.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, the player starts at t=16, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince from y=0 to y=9, min steps is 9 actions, e.g., all U.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=20,21,22.\n\nBecause at those times, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nNow, the turns: let t be the turn number.\n\nStart at t=16, y=16? No, position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t=16, y=0.\n\nThen after action a_{16}, at turn t=17, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}, and so on.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from a_{16} to a_{16+H-1} such that after H actions, at turn t=16+H, y_{16+H} =9.\n\nt=16+H, position y_{16+H}=9.\n\nAnd during the path, for each turn T from 16 to 16+H-1, when at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it should not be that x=0 covered on that freeway at time T.\n\nAt turn T, the position is y_T, and we check collision for that turn.\n\nFor example, at T=16, y_T=0, which is not between 1-8, so no collision.\n\nThen after action, at T=17, y_{17} is set, and we check for T=17, and so on.\n\nThe last turn is when we reach y=9.\n\nAt that turn, y_T=9, not between 1-8, so safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are only for y=7 and y=8 at t=20,21,22.\n\nFor other y and times, no danger.\n\ny=1 to 6 are safe at all future times except t=16, which is past, so for t>=17, y=1 to 6 are always safe to be on.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe except at t=20,21,22.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up directly, but I might need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=20,21,22.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I can adjust the timing.\n\nStart at t=16, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut if I go up directly, let's see when I would be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSuppose I always go up, U each turn.\n\nThen:\n\nt=16: y=0\n\na_{16}: U, so t=17: y=1\n\na_{17}: U, t=18: y=2\n\na_{18}: U, t=19: y=3\n\na_{19}: U, t=20: y=4\n\na_{20}: U, t=21: y=5\n\na_{21}: U, t=22: y=6\n\na_{22}: U, t=23: y=7\n\na_{23}: U, t=24: y=8\n\na_{24}: U, t=25: y=9\n\nNow, at which turns am I on which y.\n\nAt t=17: y=1\n\nt=18: y=2\n\nt=19: y=3\n\nt=20: y=4\n\nt=21: y=5\n\nt=22: y=6\n\nt=23: y=7\n\nt=24: y=8\n\nt=25: y=9\n\nNow, dangerous times for y=7 and 8 are t=20,21,22.\n\nBut in this path, at t=20, y=4, which is safe.\n\nt=21, y=5, safe.\n\nt=22, y=6, safe.\n\nt=23, y=7, but t=23 is not dangerous for y=7, since dangerous only at 20,21,22.\n\nt=23>22, so for y=7, dangerous at t=20,21,22, but t=23 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=24 y=8, safe.\n\nSo in this path, I never am on y=7 or 8 during t=20,21,22.\n\nI reach y=9 at t=25, with H=9 actions? From t=16 to t=25, that's 9 steps? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=16, after one action, at t=17, after H actions, at t=16+H.\n\nSet to 9 at t=16+H.\n\nIn this case, after 9 actions: from a_{16} to a_{24}, that's 9 actions, at t=25, y=9.\n\nAnd during t=17 to 24, all y from 1 to 8, but at safe times.\n\nSpecifically, at t=20, y=4, which is safe since y=4 only dangerous at t=16.\n\nt=21, y=5, safe.\n\nt=22, y=6, safe.\n\nt=23, y=7, but t=23 not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo this seems to work with H=9.\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster?\n\nMinimal H: from y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves up, but I could go up faster? No, each action changes y by at most 1, so min 9 actions to go from 0 to 9.\n\nUnless I start from 0, but I have to move to 1, etc.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with |Δy|<=1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 steps, yes.\n\nSo H=9 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, with all U, I avoid the dangerous times naturally.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor y=7 and 8, dangerous at t=20,21,22.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=7 at t=23, which is after, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=24, safe.\n\nAnd at t=20,21,22, I am on y=4,5,6, which are safe.\n\ny=4,5,6 have no cars at x=0 after t=16, so safe at all t>=17.\n\nSimilarly y=1,2,3 safe.\n\nSo yes, I can just go straight up with no issues.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nStart at t=16, y=0.\n\nAction a_{16}: U, go to y=1 at t=17.\n\nThen a_{17}: U, to y=2 at t=18.\n\na_{18}: U, to y=3 at t=19.\n\na_{19}: U, to y=4 at t=20.\n\na_{20}: U, to y=5 at t=21.\n\na_{21}: U, to y=6 at t=22.\n\na_{22}: U, to y=7 at t=23.\n\na_{23}: U, to y=8 at t=24.\n\na_{24}: U, to y=9 at t=25.\n\nNow at t=25, y=9, reached.\n\nH=9 turns.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=16 to t=24, actions a_{16} to a_{24}.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere t_1=16, H=9, so actions from a_{16} to a_{24}, which is t_1 to t_1 +8? t_1 + (H-1) =16+8=24.\n\nIndices: t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\na_{t} for t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nIn this case, t_1=16, after H=9 actions, at t=25, y=9.\n\nActions: a_{16}, a_{17}, ..., a_{24}.\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 24: U\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, player at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen for each subsequent turn, as above, no issue.\n\nBut in the path, at t=23, y=7, which is freeway 7, but at t=23, is x=0 covered?\n\nFor y=7, at t=23, which is k=T-16=23-16=7.\n\nFor the third car, dangerous when k=4,5,6, i.e., t=20,21,22.\n\nk=7, left = -27 +4*7 = -27+28=1\n\nRight = -16 +4*7 = -16+28=12\n\nSo [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly t=24, y=8, k=8, left= -27+32=5, right=-16+32=16, [5,16], not cover 0.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on freeway 7 and 8, but only the third one was dangerous, and only at t=20,21,22.\n\nBut in our path, we avoid y=7 and 8 at those times.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? No, 9 is minimum.\n\nBut start from y=0, to y=9, must increase by 9, each step at most +1, so min 9 moves.\n\nI could stay or go down, but that would only increase H, not decrease.\n\nSo H=9 is minimum.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 4,5,6 at t=16, car at x=0, but since player not on it, ok.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=4 at t=20, which is fine.\n\nAnother thing: at t=16, if I do S, stay at y=0, then I waste a turn, and reach later.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, not possible at y=0.\n\nSo best to go up directly.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for each turn.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=16.\n\nWe need actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, H=9, so t from 16 to 24.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut in the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nBut since H=9, and we reach at turn 25.\n\nBut the sequence is up to turn 24.\n\nNow, but in the car for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can be on y=7 or 8 at other times, but only dangerous at t=20,21,22.\n\nFor example, if I were to be on y=7 at t=20, collision, but in our path, not.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nLet me read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n\"turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nIn the context, \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nH is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach.\n\nAnd H is to be minimized.\n\nHere H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can do it with H=9.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I start by going up faster, but I can't, since I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nUnless I am already at y=9, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 and y=9 are safe, and I can stay, but staying would increase H.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn, then at t=17, y=0, then start going up, I reach later, say at t=26, with H=10, worse.\n\nSimilarly, going down not possible.\n\nSo H=9 is best.\n\nIn the sequence above, it works.\n\nBut let me check for y=7 at t=23: as above, safe.\n\nPerhaps I should write the actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for each turn starting from t1.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4,5,6, at t=16, car at x=0, but since player at y=0, no collision.\n\nAnd in our path, we are not on those rows at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that for freeway 7 and 8, at t=20,21,22, but we avoid.\n\nAnother thing: the player update: when I move, at turn T, I am at y_T, then I choose action, and move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision is only at the current turn for the current y.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, I am at y_T, and I move to y_{T+1}, at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so no collision for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, not relevant.\n\nI think the path is fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be boxed with the turns.\n\nSo for this, it would be:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 25, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? Impossible, since from 0 to 9, min 9 steps.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start from 0.\n\ny=0 to y=9, difference 9, each action changes by at most 1, so min 9 actions.\n\nThus, this should be minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 20, I am going to y=5? Let's list:\n\nAfter a_{16}: U, at t=17 y=1\n\na_{17}: U, t=18 y=2\n\na_{18}: U, t=19 y=3\n\na_{19}: U, t=20 y=4\n\na_{20}: U, t=21 y=5\n\na_{21}: U, t=22 y=6\n\na_{22}: U, t=23 y=7\n\na_{23}: U, t=24 y=8\n\na_{24}: U, t=25 y=9\n\nAt t=20, y=4, which is freeway 4, but at t=20, is x=0 covered?\n\nFor freeway 4, at t=20.\n\nFreeway 4: car (0,-23,right,24)\n\nAt T=20, k=20-16=4\n\nLeft = τ + s(k) = -23 + 24*4 = -23 + 96 = 73\n\nRight = h + s(k) = 0 + 24*4 = 96\n\nSo [73,96], 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=21, y=5, same thing, left = -23 +24*5= -23+120=97, etc, not 0.\n\nt=22, y=6, similar.\n\nt=23, y=7, as before.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to be careful at other points, but seems not.\n\nAnother thought: for freeway 7 and 8, at t=20,21,22, if I were on them, collision, but I am not.\n\nSuppose I go slower or faster.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can't.\n\nStart from t=16 y=0.\n\nIf I could jump, but no.\n\nSo I think H=9 with all U is fine.\n\nBut the problem might expect me to consider something else.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and 8, since multiple cars, but only the third one matters.\n\nIn freeway 7, cars: first car at [45+4k,56+4k], min 45>0, so never cover 0.\n\nSecond car [9+4k,20+4k], min 9>0, never cover 0.\n\nThird car, as above.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo only issue at t=20,21,22 for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn our path, we are on lower y at that time.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I start from higher, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since I am at y=0 at t=16, I can move to y=1 at t=17, but y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all.\n\nPerhaps at t=16, I do nothing, but then I waste a turn.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it ends at turn 24, and at turn 25 we are at y=9.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we need the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should output it.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 7 and 8, it has three cars, but only one is dangerous.\n\nBut I think I covered.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list for each freeway when x=0 is covered.\n\ny=1: only at t=16\n\ny=2: same, only t=16\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: car (0,-23,right,24), at t=16, span [ -23, 0], 0 covered.\n\nAt t=17, [1,24], not covered.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6 same.\n\ny=7: cars as above, only third car can cover 0, at t=20,21,22.\n\nAt t=20: k=4, left= -27+16= -11? s=4, k=4, left= -27 +4*4= -27+16= -11\n\nRight= -16 +16=0? -16 +4*4= -16+16=0\n\nSo at t=20, span for third car: left= -11, right=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly t=21: k=5, left= -27+20= -7, right= -16+20=4, [ -7,4], 0 covered.\n\nt=22: k=6, left= -27+24= -3, right= -16+24=8, [ -3,8], 0 covered.\n\nt=23: k=7, left= -27+28=1, right=12, not cover.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 same.\n\nSo yes.\n\nIn our path, at t=20, y=4; t=21,y=5; t=22,y=6; all not 7 or 8.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go up slower to avoid, but no need.\n\nOr faster, but can't.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut the sequence should be written.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: U \\\\ Turn 22: U \\\\ Turn 23: U \\\\ Turn 24: U }\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt_1=16, actions from t=16 to t=24, which is t_1 to t_1 + 8, since H=9, t_1 + H -1 =16+9-1=24.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd the actions are all U.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n\nSince the sequence is repetitive, but I think I need to list all.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I should write with the turn numbers.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists entirely of \"U\" (up) moves, as this direct upward path avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- Cars on freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) only cover \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(t = 16\\), which is the starting turn where the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway, so no collision occurs). For \\(t \\geq 17\\), these freeways are safe as \\(x = 0\\) is not covered.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) have cars that cover \\(x = 0\\) at turns \\(t = 20, 21, 22\\). In the path:\n  - At \\(t = 20\\), the player is at \\(y = 4\\), which is safe.\n  - At \\(t = 21\\), the player is at \\(y = 5\\), which is safe.\n  - At \\(t = 22\\), the player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe.\n- At \\(t = 23\\) and \\(t = 24\\), the player is on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) respectively, but these turns are outside the dangerous period (\\(t = 20, 21, 22\\)), so no collision occurs.\n\n### Path Summary:\n- Start at turn \\(t = 16\\), \\(y = 0\\).\n- After each \"U\" action, the player moves up by 1 unit per turn.\n- After 9 actions (turns 16 to 24), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 25.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16 + 9 - 1 = 24\\) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t1=18 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (+1 in y), D for down (-1 in y), or S for stay (0 change). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=18. The direction tells if it's left-moving or right-moving, but from the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so head increases.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1,2,3: (-48, -83, right, 36). But head is -48, tail is -83, and direction right. If direction is right, head should be the right end, so tail should be less than head? -83 is less than -48, so tail is left, head is right. So for right-moving, span is [tail, head] since tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). Since direction is right, and head=-48, tail=-83, so tail < head, so span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4,5,6: (48, 25, right, 24). head=48, tail=25, so tail=25 < head=48, so span [25,48] for right-moving.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4), (-8, -19, right, 4). Each is a separate car on the same freeway.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn. Meaning the car covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T. Only at turn T, you are on y_T, so you care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAt each turn, the player is on a specific row, and checks for collision only with cars on that row at that exact turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=2 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and we start at y=2, we need to move up, so probably mostly U actions, but might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements over time.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1, so at turn T = t1 + Δt.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars horizontally, the collision depends only on the row and the time.\n\nFor each row y from 1 to 8, and for each time Δt, I need to know if there is a car covering x=0 at that time on that row.\n\nThen, when the player is on row y at time Δt, it must not be a collision time for that row.\n\nThe time is from the perspective of turns, starting from t1=18.\n\nSet t1=18 as time zero for simplicity. So let τ = T - t1, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, player is at y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ=H-1, since actions from t=0 to H-1, position at t+H-1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1 + H - 1, so positions from y_{t1} to y_{t1 + H - 1}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn T from t1 to t1 + H - 1, when player is at y_T, no collision on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, since we start at τ=0, y=2.\n\nGoal is to have y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nτ is the step from start, so at step τ, turn is t1 + τ.\n\nPosition y_τ at step τ.\n\nDefine: let k be the step, from k=0 to k=H-1.\n\nAt k=0: turn t1, position y=2\n\nAfter action a_k, position at k+1.\n\nBut the position after action is for the next turn.\n\nClarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, player has position (0, y_T), and takes action a_T.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, position updates to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAnd at turn T, when position is (0, y_T), we check collision with cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nIn terms of k, let k be the turn index from start.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so τ=0: turn t1, position y=2\n\nτ=1: turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, the position at turn t1 + (H-1) should be 9.\n\ny_{t1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nAnd for each τ from 0 to H-1, at turn t1 + τ, position y_τ, no collision on row y_τ at time t1 + τ.\n\nNow, for the cars, at time T = t1 + τ.\n\nFor each car, given at t1, we can compute span at T.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but we only care when 0 is in the span at integer T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need the times when x=0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nStart with freeway 1: cars? Only one car: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span [τ, h] = [-83, -48] since tail=-83, head=-48.\n\nSpeed s=36.\n\nAt time T, span [ -83 + 36*(T-t1), -48 + 36*(T-t1) ] because right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nLet Δt = T - t1\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 + 36Δt, -48 + 36Δt ]\n\n0 is in span if -83 + 36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36Δt\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nFreeway 1 has only one car, so we solve for Δt:\n\n-83 + 36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36Δt ≤ 0 => 36Δt ≤ 83 => Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt ≤ 2 since Δt integer?

But at y=9, it's the goal, and no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start at y=2 and go up.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nCurrent y=2.\n\ny=2 is a freeway, so at τ=0, we are on y=2, need to check collision at τ=0.\n\nBut τ=0 is current time, and we are given the state, so at τ=0, is there collision on y=2?\n\ny=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: at τ=0, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 2, car: at t1, span [-83,-48], which is all negative, x=0 not in [-83,-48], so no collision at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows at τ=0.\n\nBut we are at y=2, so only care about y=2 at τ=0.\n\nNo collision.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 steps of U, since each U increases y by 1, so after 7 U actions, we go to y=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nLet’s think.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter first action a_0, at τ=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k, position y_k.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at y=2, to reach y=9, we need to increase y by 7, so minimal actions: if all U, then after 7 actions, at τ=7, y=2+7=9.\n\nAt τ=7, position y=9.\n\nNow, during the path, for each τ from 0 to 6, we are at some y_τ, and must not collide.\n\ny_τ must be between 0 and 9, and for each τ, if y_τ is between 1 and 8, it must not be a collision time for that row.\n\nIn the minimal path, we go directly up: y_τ = 2 + τ for τ=0 to 7? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0: y=2\n\nAfter a_0, at τ=1: y=2 + Δy_0\n\nIf a_0=U, y=3 at τ=1\n\nGenerally, if we go up each step, at τ, y_τ = 2 + τ, for τ=0 to 7.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2\n\nτ=1, y=3\n\n...\n\nτ=7, y=9\n\nAnd we need to check for τ=0 to τ=6, since at τ=7, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, y_τ from τ=0 to 6: y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nWe need no collision at each of these positions and times.\n\nNow, for each row and time, collision possibilities.\n\nFirst, row y=2: freeway 2.\n\nCollision only at Δt=2, as we found.\n\nΔt is the time from t1, which is τ.\n\nSo for row 2, collision at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, if player is on y=2, collision.\n\nBut in the path, at τ=2, if we go straight up, y_2 = 2 + 2 = 4? Let's index.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nIn straight up: τ=0: y=2\n\nτ=1: y=3\n\nτ=2: y=4\n\nτ=3: y=5\n\nτ=4: y=6\n\nτ=5: y=7\n\nτ=6: y=8\n\nτ=7: y=9\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nBut freeway 4 has no collision at any time, as we saw.\n\nNow, where are collisions:\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: collision only at τ=2.\n\nBut row 1,2,3 are different.\n\nFor row 2: collision at τ=2.\n\nBut in the path, at τ=2, we are on y=4, not on y=2, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, row 1: freeway 1, collision at τ=2.\n\nBut we are not on row 1 at τ=2.\n\nNow row 3: freeway 3, collision at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, in path, y=4, not 3.\n\nNow row 4,5,6: no collision ever.\n\nRow 7: freeway 7, collisions at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\nRow 8: freeway 8, same, collisions at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\nIn the straight up path:\n\nAt τ=2: y=4, row 4, no collision.\n\nτ=3: y=5, row 5, no collision.\n\nτ=4: y=6, row 6, no collision.\n\nτ=5: y=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 has collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14.\n\nAt τ=5, which is not in {2,3,4,12,13,14}, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, τ=6: y=8, row 8, collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14, τ=6 not in, so no collision.\n\nτ=0: y=2, row 2, at τ=0, no collision, as we saw.\n\nτ=1: y=3, row 3, collision only at τ=2 for row 3, so at τ=1, no collision.\n\nAll seem fine.\n\nBut at τ=2,3,4, row 7 and 8 have collisions, but at those times, in this path, we are on lower rows.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=2, y=4; τ=3, y=5; τ=4, y=6; all safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=7, τ=5 not collision time for row 7.\n\nSimilarly τ=6, y=8, safe.\n\nSo in 7 steps, all U: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U, we go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nH=7 actions? Let's confirm.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=6? No.\n\nThe sequence: actions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H actions, at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nWe want that position to be 9.\n\nStart at τ=0 (turn t1), position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_0 at τ=0, position at τ=1 (turn t1+1) is y1 = y0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k} at turn t1+k, position at turn t1+k+1 is y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nStandard: at turn T, position y_T, take action a_T, then at turn T+1, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo for T from t1 to t1 + H - 1, actions a_T.\n\nPosition at T: y_T for T = t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt T=t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAnd for each T from t1 to t1 + H - 1, no collision at (y_T, T).\n\nIn terms of τ, let τ = T - t1, so τ from 0 to H-1.\n\ny_τ at τ.\n\ny_τ =9 for some τ, but we need at the end, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nSince we start at y_0=2, and we want to reach y_{H-1}=9.\n\nThe minimal H is when we go up as fast as possible.\n\nWith all U, y_τ = 2 + τ for τ=0 to 7? y_0=2, y_1=3, ..., y_7=9, so at τ=7, y=9.\n\nSo we need H-1 =7? τ from 0 to H-1, so if y_{H-1}=9, and y_0=2, then with all U, y_k = 2 + k for k=0 to 7, so when k=7, y=9, so H-1=7, thus H=8.\n\nI think I confused the indices.\n\nSet τ from 0.\n\nAt time τ (turn t1 + τ), position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ is taken at time τ.\n\nThen y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nWe start with y_0 = 2.\n\nWe want for some H, y_H = 9? No.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at time H.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at time 0, position y_0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at time 0), position at time 1.\n\nAfter H actions (at times 0 to H-1), position at time H.\n\nWe want position at time H to be 9, so y_H =9.\n\nAnd for each time t from 0 to H-1, at position y_t, no collision at time t.\n\ny_t is the position at time t, before action or after?\n\nAt time t, position y_t, then we take action a_t, and at time t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at time t when position is y_t.\n\nSo for each t from 0 to H-1, we need no collision at (y_t, t).\n\nAnd y_H =9.\n\nStart: t=0, y_0=2.\n\nEnd: y_H=9.\n\nWith all U actions, y_t = 2 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H.\n\ny_t = 2 + t.\n\nThen y_H = 2 + H =9, so H=7.\n\nThen y_t = 2 + t for t=0 to 7.\n\ny_0=2, y_1=3, y_2=4, y_3=5, y_4=6, y_5=7, y_6=8, y_7=9.\n\nNow, collision check for t=0 to t=6, since at t=7, y=9, no check needed or safe.\n\nt from 0 to 6: positions y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at times t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nNow:\n\nt=0, y=2: row 2, at τ=0 (time from t1), no collision as before.\n\nt=1, y=3: row 3, at τ=1. Row 3 collision only at τ=2, so at τ=1, no collision.\n\nt=2, y=4: row 4, no collision ever.\n\nt=3, y=5: row 5, no collision.\n\nt=4, y=6: row 6, no collision.\n\nt=5, y=7: row 7, at τ=5. Row 7 collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14. τ=5 not in, so no collision.\n\nt=6, y=8: row 8, at τ=6, not collision time (2,3,4,12,13,14), so no collision.\n\nThus, all safe with H=7 actions: all U.\n\nBut is that possible? At t=5, y=7, τ=5, no car at x=0 on row 7.\n\nSimilarly t=6, y=8, τ=6, no issue.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have collisions at τ=2,3,4, but at those times, we are not on row 7 or 8.\n\nIn this path, at τ=2, we are on y=4; τ=3 on y=5; τ=4 on y=6; all safe rows.\n\nSo yes, with 7 up actions, we reach in 7 steps.\n\nBut the player position: from (0,2) at turn 18, after actions, to (0,9) at turn 18+7=25.\n\nActions at turn 18 to 24.\n\nSequence: a_{18} to a_{24}, all U.\n\nThen at turn 25, position y=9.\n\nBut we need to output the actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t1=18, actions from 18 to 24, all U.\n\nBut is there any problem?\n\nEarlier for row 7 at τ=5, which is turn 18+5=23, position y=7.\n\nCars on row 7: at τ=5, Δt=5.\n\nFirst car: [ -59 +4*5, -48 +4*5] = [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39,-28], all negative, x=0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [17+20,28+20]=[37,48], all positive, not.\n\nThird car: [-19+20, -8+20]=[1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSo no car covers x=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6, turn 24, y=8.\n\nRow 8 cars: same as row 7, at τ=6.\n\nFirst car: [-59+24, -48+24]= [-35,-24], negative.\n\nSecond: [17+24,28+24]=[41,52], positive.\n\nThird: [-19+24, -8+24]=[5,16], positive, 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nAnd at τ=2, when row 2 has collision, but we are on y=4, not y=2.\n\ny=4 at τ=2, row 4, no cars or no collision.\n\nFreeway 4 has car but never covers x=0.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the minimal H is 7? We can reach in 7 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can do faster.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=2, we need at least 7 steps up, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nWith S or D, it would take more turns, so minimal is 7 with all U.\n\nAnd in this case, it works with no collision.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and here it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 7 and 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, row 7 has collision? But we are not on it.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=4 at τ=2.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should list the collision times for each row.\n\nRow 1: collision at τ=2\n\nRow 2: collision at τ=2\n\nRow 3: collision at τ=2\n\nRow 4: no collision\n\nRow 5: no collision\n\nRow 6: no collision\n\nRow 7: collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\nRow 8: collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\nIn the path t=0 to t=6:\n\nt=0 (τ=0): y=2, row 2, collision at τ=2 only, not 0, safe.\n\nt=1 (τ=1): y=3, row 3, collision at τ=2 only, not 1, safe.\n\nt=2 (τ=2): y=4, row 4, no collision, safe.\n\nt=3 (τ=3): y=5, row 5, no collision, safe.\n\nt=4 (τ=4): y=6, row 6, no collision, safe.\n\nt=5 (τ=5): y=7, row 7, collision at 2,3,4,12,13,14; τ=5 not in, safe.\n\nt=6 (τ=6): y=8, row 8, collision at 2,3,4,12,13,14; τ=6 not in, safe.\n\nThen t=7 (τ=7): y=9, no car, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7 with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nActions: at turn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nThen at turn 25, position (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t1=18 to t1+H-1=18+6=24? H=7 actions, from t=0 to 6, turns 18 to 24.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=6, turns 18 to 24.\n\nPosition at turn 25 is y=9.\n\nBut the collision is only checked during the actions, up to turn 24, position y=8 at turn 24.\n\nAt turn 24, we are at y=8, which we checked safe.\n\nThen after action, at turn 25, y=9, no action or no need for collision check since we reached.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"a sequence of actions ... to reach\", so when we take the last action, we reach the position.\n\nIn this case, after 7th action at turn 24, we go to y=9 at turn 25.\n\nAnd for turns 18 to 24, we have positions y=2 to y=8, all checked.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? For example, if we start higher, but we start at y=2, so minimum 7 up moves.\n\nWith down or stay, it would take more turns, so H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car at τ=2,3,4, but we avoid by being on other rows.\n\nBut in this case, we are not on row 7 or 8 during τ=2,3,4; we are on them at τ=5 and 6, which are safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm τ=5 on row 7.\n\nτ=5, turn 23.\n\nCars on row 7:\n\nFirst car: at τ=5, position [ -59 +4*5, -48 +4*5] = [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39,-28], min x=-39, max x=-28, both <0, so x=0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: [17+20, 28+20] = [37,48] >0, not covered.\n\nThird car: [-19+20, -8+20] = [1,12], min x=1>0, so x=0 not covered.\n\nYes, safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 8 at τ=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut the output should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nH=7.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if we had to avoid something, but here not.\n\nPerhaps at τ=2, row 2 has collision, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nAnother thing: the player starts at (0,2) at turn 18, and we take action immediately.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less than 7. Impossible, since need to increase y by 7.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but Δy is at most 1, so no.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is seven U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal number of turns required to increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 9 is 7, as each \"U\" action increases y by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve this.\n- The direct path with all \"U\" actions is feasible, as collision checks at each position and turn confirm no collisions occur:\n  - At turn 18 (τ=0): y=2 (freeway 2), no collision (freeway 2 collision only at τ=2).\n  - At turn 19 (τ=1): y=3 (freeway 3), no collision (freeway 3 collision only at τ=2).\n  - At turn 20 (τ=2): y=4 (freeway 4), no collision (freeway 4 has no collision at any time).\n  - At turn 21 (τ=3): y=5 (freeway 5), no collision (freeway 5 has no collision at any time).\n  - At turn 22 (τ=4): y=6 (freeway 6), no collision (freeway 6 has no collision at any time).\n  - At turn 23 (τ=5): y=7 (freeway 7), no collision (freeway 7 collisions at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14; τ=5 not included).\n  - At turn 24 (τ=6): y=8 (freeway 8), no collision (freeway 8 collisions at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14; τ=6 not included).\n- At turn 25 (after the last action), y=9, which is the goal and has no cars, so it is safe.\n- Deviations (e.g., \"D\" or \"S\") would increase \\(H\\) beyond 7, so this is minimal.\n\n### Sequence of Actions (H=7):\n- Actions from turn 18 to turn 24 (7 actions) all \"U\" to move directly to y=9 by turn 25.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car that has a span including 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars are given at turn t_1 = 19, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, ending at y=9.\n\nThe player position is updated based on action: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). And y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nFor cars, the span is given for turn t_1, and for future turns T, it moves based on speed and direction.\n\nDirection: right means increasing x, so for right-moving, span moves to the right as time increases. Similarly, left-moving moves left.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1,2,3: all have (-12,-47, right, 36). But head and tail: for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me check the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at t_1 [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: span at t_1 [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since it's right-moving, head is to the right, so h > τ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h is head, τ is tail, and h > τ, but moving left so decreasing.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36). But -12 and -47, which is bigger? -12 > -47, so for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h, so here τ = -47, h = -12? But it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), I think.\n\nLook at the car state table:\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be greater than tail. Here h = -12, τ = -47, and -12 > -47, so head is -12, tail is -47, so the span is from -47 to -12, meaning from left to right? But direction is right, so it's moving right.\n\nAt t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -12] for right-moving? No.\n\nI need to clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nHere, given (h, τ) = (-12, -47), and since it's right, so τ should be the left end, h the right end.\n\n-47 < -12, so τ = -47, h = -12, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -12].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 36(T-19), -12 + 36(T-19)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-44, -55, right, 4), (32, 21, right, 4), (-4, -15, right, 4)\n\nFor each, we need to handle separately.\n\nFirst, for (-44, -55, right, 4): h = -44, τ = -55, since right, τ < h? -55 < -44, yes, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nSimilarly, (32, 21, right, 4): h=32, τ=21, 21<32, span [21,32]\n\nBut direction is right, so it should be moving right.\n\n(32,21), so τ=21, h=32, so at t_1, x from 21 to 32.\n\nThen (-4,-15, right,4): h=-4, τ=-15, -15<-4, span [-15,-4]\n\nNow for freeway 8 same.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: (72,49, right,24)\n\nh=72, τ=49, 49<72, span [49,72] at t_1.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSpan at T for a car is the set of x positions it occupies at that time.\n\nCollision if 0 is in that span for a car on the same row y at time T.\n\nAlso, important: when you move to a new row, at turn T, you are on y_T during turn T, and you move at the end of turn or something? Let's see the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on row y_T. If you move to a different row at turn T, you are not on the new row until turn T+1.\n\nSo for collision check at turn T, you are on row y_T, and we check if 0 is in the span of any car on row y at time T.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,3) at turn t_1=19.\n\nI need to get to (0,9), so y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and no cars above, I think y=9 is safe, as there are no freeways above, I assume freeways only from 1 to 8.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways at y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, both no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3), which is on row y=3, but row y=3 has cars? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so each row from 1 to 8 has cars potentially.\n\nAt turn t_1=19, player is at (0,3), so on row 3.\n\nNow, row 3 has cars: from the table, freeway 3 has (-12,-47,right,36), so one car.\n\nBut at turn T, we need to check if 0 is in span for that freeway.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince the cars move, the span changes with time.\n\nLet t_1 = 19.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and car on it, we can find the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway possible, like row 7 and 8.\n\nBut for row 1,2,3: each has one car with s=36, direction right.\n\nRow 1: car: h=-12, τ=-47, d=right, s=36\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T-19), h + s(T-19)] = [-47 + 36(T-19), -12 + 36(T-19)]\n\n0 is in span if -47 + 36(T-19) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 36(T-19)\n\nSimilarly for row 2 and 3, same car? The table says for row 1,2,3 all have the same: (-12,-47,right,36), so all have the same span at all times.\n\nBut they are on different rows, so for each row, we consider separately, but since same car spec, for row 1,2,3, the car positions are identical at each time, but on different rows, so for collision, we care per row.\n\nFor row 1, when is 0 covered: solve for T.\n\n-47 + 36(T-19) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 36(T-19)\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 36(T-19) ≤ 0 => 36(T-19) ≤ 47 => T-19 ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305 => T ≤ 19 + 1.305 = 20.305, so T ≤ 20 since T integer? Turns are integers, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -12 + 36(T-19) => 12 ≤ 36(T-19) => 12/36 ≤ T-19 => 1/3 ≤ T-19 => T-19 ≥ 1/3, so T ≥ 19 + 1/3 ≈ 19.333, so T ≥ 20\n\nT integer, so from first: T ≤ 20.305, so T ≤ 20\n\nFrom second: T ≥ 19.333, so T ≥ 20\n\nThus T=20\n\nSo for row 1,2,3, at turn T=20, 0 is in the span, so if player is on row 1,2, or 3 at turn 20, collision.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nNow, similarly for row 4,5,6: each has (72,49,right,24)\n\nh=72, τ=49, so span at t_1: [49,72]\n\nAt T: [49 + 24(T-19), 72 + 24(T-19)]\n\n0 in span: 49 + 24(T-19) ≤ 0 ≤ 72 + 24(T-19)\n\nFirst: 49 + 24(T-19) ≤ 0 => 24(T-19) ≤ -49 => T-19 ≤ -49/24 ≈ -2.0416 => T ≤ 19 - 2.0416 = 16.958, so T ≤ 16\n\nBut T ≥ t_1=19? We are at turn 19, and T>19 for future, but this is for when 0 is covered.\n\n49 + 24(T-19) ≤ 0, since 49>0 and 24>0, for T≥19, left side positive, so never ≤0. Similarly, 0 ≤ 72 + 24(T-19) always true for T≥19.\n\nSo 0 in span only if left inequality holds, but 49 + 24(T-19) >0 for all T, so 0 is never in the span for T≥19. Because the car is at x=49 to 72 at t=19, moving right, so for T>19, it's at higher x, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for row 5 and 6.\n\nSo row 4,5,6 are always safe for x=0, since cars are at positive x and moving away.\n\nNow row 7 and 8.\n\nFirst row 7: three cars.\n\nCar1: (-44,-55,right,4) so h=-44, τ=-55, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [-55,-44] since right, [τ + s(T-19), h + s(T-19)] = [-55 + 4(T-19), -44 + 4(T-19)]\n\nCar2: (32,21,right,4) h=32, τ=21, span [21 + 4(T-19), 32 + 4(T-19)]\n\nCar3: (-4,-15,right,4) h=-4, τ=-15, span [-15 + 4(T-19), -4 + 4(T-19)]\n\nNow, 0 in span for row 7 at time T if for any car, 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly for row 8, same cars, so same times.\n\nFirst, car1: [-55 + 4(T-19), -44 + 4(T-19)]\n\n0 in span: -55 + 4(T-19) ≤ 0 ≤ -44 + 4(T-19)\n\nLeft: -55 + 4(T-19) ≤ 0 => 4(T-19) ≤ 55 => T-19 ≤ 55/4 = 13.75 => T ≤ 19 + 13.75 = 32.75, so T≤32\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -44 + 4(T-19) => 44 ≤ 4(T-19) => 11 ≤ T-19 => T ≥ 30\n\nSo T from 30 to 32 inclusive.\n\nCar2: [21 + 4(T-19), 32 + 4(T-19)]\n\n21 + 4(T-19) ≤ 0 ≤ 32 + 4(T-19)\n\nLeft: 21 + 4(T-19) ≤ 0 => 4(T-19) ≤ -21 => T-19 ≤ -21/4 = -5.25 => T ≤ 13.75, which is less than 19, so for T≥19, always false. Thus never 0 in span for car2.\n\nCar3: [-15 + 4(T-19), -4 + 4(T-19)]\n\n0 in span: -15 + 4(T-19) ≤ 0 ≤ -4 + 4(T-19)\n\nLeft: -15 + 4(T-19) ≤ 0 => 4(T-19) ≤ 15 => T-19 ≤ 15/4 = 3.75 => T ≤ 22.75, so T≤22\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -4 + 4(T-19) => 4 ≤ 4(T-19) => 1 ≤ T-19 => T ≥ 20\n\nSo T from 20 to 22 inclusive.\n\nThus for row 7, 0 is covered:\n\n- By car3 at T=20,21,22\n\n- By car1 at T=30,31,32\n\nCar2 never.\n\nSo unsafe at T=20,21,22,30,31,32\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, row 1,2,3 unsafe only at T=20.\n\nRow 4,5,6 always safe.\n\nRow 7 and 8 unsafe at T=20,21,22,30,31,32.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 are always safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 19, y=3.\n\nAt turn 19, player is at (0,3), which is row 3.\n\nNow, row 3 is unsafe only at T=20, but at T=19, is it safe?\n\nWe need to check at each turn when player is on a row with cars.\n\nAt turn T=19, player is on y=3, row 3.\n\nFor row 3 at T=19: car span is [-47 +36(0), -12+36(0)] = [-47,-12], since T-19=0.\n\n0 is not between -47 and -12, since -47 < -12 < 0? -12 < 0, so 0 > -12, not in [-47,-12]. So 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows at T=19.\n\nBut player is only on row 3 at T=19.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut since we need to go up, D might not be useful, but perhaps to avoid, but let's see.\n\ny=3 to y=9, difference of 6, so min turns if no obstacles is 6 turns, all U.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times on the rows.\n\nPlayer path: at each turn, y position.\n\nStart turn 19: y=3\n\nAfter action, turn 20: y depends on action at 19.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe need y at turn t_1 + H -1 =9.\n\nt_1=19, so at turn 19 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSet t=0 at turn 19 for simplicity, so turns relative to start.\n\nLet τ = T - 19, so τ=0 is turn 19, τ=1 turn 20, etc.\n\nPlayer position at time τ: y_τ\n\ny_0 = 3\n\nAt time τ, after τ actions, y_τ = y_0 + sum of Δy up to τ.\n\nBut Δy depends on action at each step.\n\ny_{τ} = y_{τ-1} + a_{τ} where a_τ is action effect.\n\ny_τ: after τ steps, at turn 19+τ.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some step H, so at turn 19+H, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position is after H actions.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is (0, y_T)\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nThe state is at the start of turn.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAnd at turn T, we are on row y_T, and we check collision based on cars at time T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn T=t_1=19, y=3.\n\nWe perform actions from turn 19 to turn 19+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 19+H, we are at y_{19+H}.\n\nWe want y_{19+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each turn from 19 to 19+H-1, during the turn, we are on y_T, and must not collide, meaning for the row y_T at time T, 0 not in any car span on that row.\n\nAt turn 19+H, when we reach y=9, we are on row 9, which has no cars, so always safe, no need to check, or it is safe.\n\nNow, the last action is at turn 19+H-1, which sets y_{19+H}.\n\nIf y_{19+H} =9, and since row 9 safe, no issue.\n\nNow, min H such that we can reach.\n\nFirst, from y=3 to y=9, min steps: if all U, H=6, y at turn 19:3, turn20:4, turn21:5, turn22:6, turn23:7, turn24:8, turn25:9. So at turn25, y=9, so H=6 actions from turn19 to24, at turn25 y=9.\n\nTurns: actions at 19,20,21,22,23,24 (6 actions), position at turn25 is (0,9).\n\nNow, need to check safety at each turn when on row 1-8.\n\nIn this path:\n\nTurn 19: y=3, row 3, T=19, which is safe as we saw.\n\nTurn 20: y=4? After action at 19 U, y20=4.\n\ny at turn T: at turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nTurn 19: y=3\n\nAfter action U, at turn 20, y=4\n\nAt turn 20, y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4 is always safe, as we saw.\n\nTurn 21: after action U, y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nTurn 22: y=6, row 6, safe.\n\nTurn 23: y=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 at turn 23: T=23, which is τ=4.\n\nUnsafe times for row 7: T=20,21,22,30,31,32.\n\nT=23 is not in 20,21,22 nor 30-32, so safe? T=23, from above, car3 unsafe 20,21,22; car1 unsafe 30-32; so yes, safe at T=23.\n\nSimilarly, turn 24: y=8, row 8 at T=24.\n\nRow 8 same as row 7, unsafe at 20,21,22,30,31,32, T=24 safe.\n\nThen turn 25: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 20, y=4, which is row 4, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, all seem safe.\n\nBut at turn 20, y=4, row 4, safe.\n\nBut row 3 is unsafe at T=20, but at T=20, player is on row 4, not row 3.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 unsafe at T=20,21,22, but at those times, player is not on row 7.\n\nIn this path:\n\n- T=19: y=3, row 3, T=19 safe\n\n- T=20: y=4, row 4, T=20 safe\n\n- T=21: y=5, row 5, safe\n\n- T=22: y=6, row 6, safe\n\n- T=23: y=7, row 7, T=23 safe\n\n- T=24: y=8, row 8, T=24 safe\n\n- T=25: y=9, safe\n\nAll good? But row 7 is unsafe at T=20,21,22, but at T=20,21,22, player is on y=4,5,6, not 7.\n\nAt T=23, y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut H=6 turns, actions from turn19 to24.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\ny=3 to y=9, difference 6, so min 6 moves with only U, cannot be shorter unless we go down, but going down would take more turns, so min is 6.\n\nBut with S, we could stay, but that increases H, so for min H, we should not use S or D.\n\nSo H=6 seems possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the row 7 at T=23.\n\nT=23, τ=4, T-19=4\n\nFor row 7 car3: span [-15 +4(4), -4 +4(4)] = [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar1: [-55+16, -44+16] = [-39,-28], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [21+16,32+16]=[37,48], not.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=24, row8 same.\n\nBut in the path above, at turn 24, y=8, row8, T=24, T-19=5\n\ncar3: [-15+20, -4+20] = [5,16], 0 not in? -15+4*5= -15+20=5, -4+20=16, [5,16], 0 not in.\n\ncar1: [-55+20, -44+20]=[-35,-24], not.\n\ncar2: [21+20,32+20]=[41,52], not.\n\nSafe.\n\nNow, but at T=20, row3 is unsafe, but player not there.\n\nIn this sequence, player is on row3 only at T=19, which is safe.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=20 for other rows?\n\nRow4 at T=20: as we said, always safe.\n\nBut let me list the unsafe rows per turn:\n\nFor T=20:\n\nUnsafe rows: row1,2,3 (because of car at T=20)\n\nAlso row7 and8 because of car3 at T=20,21,22.\n\nSo row1,2,3,7,8 unsafe at T=20.\n\nBut row4,5,6 safe.\n\nIn the path, at T=20, player is on y=4, row4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly T=21: row1,2,3? Row1,2,3 unsafe only at T=20, not T=21.\n\nAt T=21, which rows unsafe?\n\nRow1: only unsafe at T=20, so at T=21 safe.\n\nSimilarly row2,3 safe at T=21.\n\nRow7 and8 unsafe at T=21 because of car3.\n\nAlso row4,5,6 safe.\n\nSo at T=21, unsafe rows: 7 and 8.\n\nIn path, player on row5, safe.\n\nT=22: similarly, row7 and8 unsafe, player on row6, safe.\n\nT=23: all rows safe except row7,8 at T=30-32, but T=23 safe, player on row7, but row7 safe at T=23 as above.\n\nT=24: player row8, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn25.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, with all U, we can do it in H=6.\n\nBut is there a way with H=5? y from 3 to 9, with 5 steps, net +6, but each step max +1, so impossible to gain 6 in 5 steps. Min steps is 6 with all U.\n\nIf we use D, it would take more steps, so H=6 is min.\n\nBut perhaps we can arrive earlier by being on row9 at an earlier turn, but from y=3, to y=9, must increase by 6, so at least 6 steps.\n\nUnless we start higher, but we start at 3.\n\ny_0=3, after k steps, y_k <= 3 + k, since max +1 per step.\n\ny_k = 3 + sum Δy, each Δy <=1, so to have y_k=9, 3 + sum <= 3 + k, so 9 <= 3+k, k>=6.\n\nSo min H=6.\n\nAnd with the sequence above, it seems safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 23, we are on row7, which is safe, but row7 is unsafe at T=20,21,22, but T=23 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we are on a row when unsafe.\n\nIn the path: turn19: row3, T=19 safe\n\nturn20: row4, T=20, row4 safe\n\nturn21: row5, T=21, row5 safe\n\nturn22: row6, T=22, row6 safe\n\nturn23: row7, T=23, row7 safe as above\n\nturn24: row8, T=24, row8 safe\n\nturn25: row9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the car on row3 at T=20: span at T=20: for row3, T=20, T-19=1, span [-47+36(1), -12+36(1)] = [-11, 24], so [ -11, 24], 0 is in this, since -11<=0<=24, yes, so if player on row3 at T=20, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at T=20, player on row4, not row3.\n\nSimilarly, row7 at T=20: car3 span at T=20: [-15 +4(1), -4 +4(1)] = [-11,0], T-19=1, -15+4= -11, -4+4=0, so [-11,0], and 0 is included, so yes, unsafe.\n\nBut player not on row7 at T=20.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but impossible.\n\nOr with stay, but that increases H.\n\nSo H=6 should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: at turn19, y=3.\n\nAction at turn19: U, to go to y=4.\n\nIn the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list actions starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=19.\n\nSo for turn19: action U\n\nThen turn20: action U (to y=5)\n\nIn the path:\n\nAfter action at turn19 U, y20=4\n\nThen action at turn20 U, y21=5\n\nAction at turn21 U, y22=6\n\nAction at turn22 U, y23=7\n\nAction at turn23 U, y24=8\n\nAction at turn24 U, y25=9\n\nSo actions: turn19: U, turn20: U, turn21: U, turn22: U, turn23: U, turn24: U\n\nH=6.\n\nBut is there any reason this might not work? Seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can use fewer by not going to row7 at T=23, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: at turn24, we are on row8, which is safe, but row8 at T=24 is safe, as above.\n\nBut let me confirm T=24 for row8.\n\nT=24, T-19=5\n\ncar3: [-15 +4*5, -4 +4*5] = [-15+20, -4+20] = [5,16], 0 not in.\n\ncar1: [-55+20, -44+20]=[-35,-24], not.\n\ncar2: [21+20,32+20]=[41,52], not.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car state for row7 and8, there is car2: (32,21,right,4), which at T=19 is [21,32], moving right, so always above 21, so never near 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it works.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in this case H=6.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother point: the player starts at (0,3) at turn19, which is on row3.\n\nNow, when we move, for example, if at some turn we are on a row and move away, but we only care about the row we are on during that turn.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for row7 at T=23, but it's safe.\n\nBut let me see if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is row9, no cars.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer turns by going directly, but impossible.\n\nOr perhaps by staying on some row to avoid unsafe times, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nSo min H=6.\n\nBut let me see the car on row1,2,3: they are unsafe at T=20 only.\n\nIn our path, we are not on them at T=20.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we go down, but that seems worse.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=2 or something, but row2 has cars and unsafe at T=20, so at T=19, if we go D, to y=2 at turn20, but at turn20, y=2, row2, which is unsafe at T=20, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at turn19, S, then at turn20 y=3, row3, unsafe, collision.\n\nSo at turn19, we must move up to avoid being on row3 at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nBut in our case, we move up immediately.\n\nAt turn19, action U, to y=4 at turn20, which is safe.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nCould we move up faster? No.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some rows, but no, each step changes by at most 1.\n\nSo I think H=6 with all U is fine.\n\nBut let me check row7 at T=23: T=23, τ=4.\n\ncar3: [-15 +4*4, -4 +4*4] = [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], 0 not in, good.\n\ncar1: [-55+16, -44+16]=[-39,-28], not.\n\ncar2: [21+16,32+16]=[37,48], not.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo a_{19}, a_{20}, ..., a_{24}\n\nEach U.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and in this case at turn25 (0,9).\n\nBut is there a way to be at (0,9) earlier? No, since at turn19, y=3, after 5 steps, max y=8, not 9.\n\nSo turn25 is earliest.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at turn24? How?\n\nStart turn19 y=3, after action at19, turn20 y=4, ..., after action at23, turn24 y=7? Let's see:\n\nAfter k actions, at turn19+k, y = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy for actions at turn19+i.\n\nTo have y_{19+H} =9 after H actions.\n\ny_{19+H} = y_{19} + sum_{t=0}^{H-1} Δy_{19+t} = 3 + sum of actions from t=19 to 19+H-1.\n\nEach action contributes +1,0,-1.\n\nTo have 3 + sum =9, so sum = +6, so at least 6 actions, each +1.\n\nSo impossible with less.\n\nThus H=6 min.\n\nAnd sequence all U.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn24, after action U, y=8 to y=9, so at turn25 y=9.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we pass through an unsafe state.\n\nFor example, when moving from row to row, but according to the note, when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps for row7, but we are not on it at unsafe times.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\) is 6. The sequence of actions is all \"U\" (up) moves, as this directly minimizes the number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- The player starts at row \\(y = 3\\) at turn 19. At this turn, row 3 is safe because the car span is \\([-47, -12]\\), and 0 is not in this interval.\n- Moving up each turn ensures the player is never on a row during an unsafe turn:\n  - Turn 20: Player is on row 4. Row 4 is always safe (cars at row 4 never cover x=0 for \\(T \\geq 19\\)).\n  - Turn 21: Player is on row 5. Row 5 is always safe.\n  - Turn 22: Player is on row 6. Row 6 is always safe.\n  - Turn 23: Player is on row 7. Row 7 is unsafe at turns 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, but turn 23 is safe (car spans: car1 \\([-39, -28]\\), car2 \\([37, 48]\\), car3 \\([1, 12]\\); 0 not in any span).\n  - Turn 24: Player is on row 8. Row 8 is unsafe at turns 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, but turn 24 is safe (car spans: car1 \\([-35, -24]\\), car2 \\([41, 52]\\), car3 \\([5, 16]\\); 0 not in any span).\n- Turn 25: Player reaches row 9, which has no cars and is always safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 19 to 24 (6 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 19: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 25 in the minimal number of turns (\\(H = 6\\)) without any collisions.",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=22, and I start at y=0. The cars are given for each freeway.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. For each car, at turn t, its position is given by the span [head, tail] for left-moving or [tail, head] for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ] and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]. Similarly for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h] and becomes [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says: (-48, -83, right, 36). Since it's right-moving, the span at t₁=22 is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" where τ is tail and h is head. So in the notation, when it says (h, τ, d, s), I think h is head and τ is tail, so for right-moving, the span is from tail to head, increasing.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). So h = -48, τ = -83? But -48 is greater than -83, so if it's right-moving, the tail is at -83, head at -48, so the span is from left to right, tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, I collide.\n\nAlso, important: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T. If I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nSpecifically: at turn T, I am at position (0, y_T). Collision happens if for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span at time T.\n\nThen, when I take action a_T, I move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, and at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I check for collision on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, I don't collide because I'm not there yet. I only care when I am on that row at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, when I leave a row, I don't care about future positions.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9 from y=0. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there. Cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, so I can be there safely.\n\nStart at (0,0) at turn t₁=22.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) at some turn T, meaning y_T = 9.\n\nAnd I need minimal H such that after H turns, I'm at y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t= t₁ to t₁ + H -1, actions a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1}, and position at turn t₁ + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\nLet t be the turn number starting from t₁.\n\nAt turn t relative to t₁, time is t₁ + t.\n\nSet t=0 at current turn.\n\nSo at turn t (relative), time absolute is T = t₁ + t.\n\nPosition y_t, with y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t=H, y_H should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=0: position y_0\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn t=1, position y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, at turn t=H, position y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1}\n\nAnd we want y_H = 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, and position at turn H should be 9.\n\nTurn indices: from turn t₁ to t₁ + H -1 for actions, and position at turn t₁ + H -1 is after action, so turn t₁ + H -1 has position y =9.\n\nSet τ = t - t₁, so τ from 0 to H, with y_τ at time t₁ + τ.\n\ny_0 at τ=0 (t=22)\n\ny_1 at τ=1 (t=23)\n\n...\n\ny_H at τ=H (t=22+H)\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nActions a_τ for τ from 0 to H-1, determining y_{τ+1} = y_τ + a_τ, with a_τ in {U,D,S}, U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ, with Δy from U,D,S.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and want to go to y=9, we need to go up, so U actions, but we have to avoid the cars on rows 1-8.\n\nWe can go down or stay, but since we need to go up, probably mostly U, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut minimal H, so we want to go as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so time steps.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible, but only if safe.\n\nNow, for each row and time, we need to know if at that time, position x=0 is occupied by a car on that row.\n\nFor each freeway k (row), and at each time T, if 0 is in the span of some car on row k at time T.\n\nCars are moving with constant speed.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each row.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head = -48, tail = -83, direction = right, speed = 36\n\nSince right-moving, at time t₁=22, span is [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-83 + 36(T-22), -48 + 36(T-22)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) so same car? No, each freeway has its own cars, I think. Freeway 1 and 2 both have identical cars? But different rows.\n\nFreeway 1: one car with those parameters.\n\nFreeway 2: also one car with same parameters.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, for each row, we need to find when x=0 is occupied.\n\nA position x is occupied at time T if for some car on that row, 0 is in the span, meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince the span is an interval.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] and since τ <= h, it's [left, right] with left <= right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet me check directions.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: right\n\n6: right\n\n7: all right\n\n8: all right\n\nNo left-moving cars, all right-moving.\n\nSo for all, at time T, for a car with initial head h, tail τ at t₁, speed s, right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd x=0 is occupied if τ + s(T-t₁) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t₁)\n\nSince τ <= h, this is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s(T-t₁) <= 0 and 0 <= h + s(T-t₁)\n\nWhich is:\n\ns(T-t₁) <= -τ and s(T-t₁) >= -h\n\nFrom τ + s(T-t₁) <= 0 => s(T-t₁) <= -τ\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s(T-t₁) => s(T-t₁) >= -h\n\nAlso, since τ and h are negative in many cases, but let's keep it.\n\nSet Δt = T - t₁, so time since t₁.\n\nThen for a car, occupied at Δt if:\n\n-τ >= s Δt and s Δt >= -h\n\nFrom above:\n\ns Δt >= -h  (since -h >=0 if h negative)\n\nand s Δt <= -τ\n\nBut -τ and -h are positive since τ and h negative.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: τ = -83, h = -48, s=36\n\nThen occupied when s Δt >= -h and s Δt <= -τ\n\n- h = -(-48) = 48\n\n-τ = -(-83) = 83\n\nSo 36 Δt >= 48 and 36 Δt <= 83\n\nSo Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >= 2 since integer? Δt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nT and t₁ are integers, I assume, so Δt integer.\n\nt₁=22, T integer, so Δt = T - t₁ integer.\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n\n36 Δt >= 48 and 36 Δt <= 83\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nΔt <= floor(83/36) = ? 36*2=72, 36*3=108>83, so 83/36≈2.305, floor=2\n\n36 Δt <= 83, Δt <= floor(83/36) = 2 since 36*2=72 <=83, 36*3=108>83\n\nAnd Δt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nAlso, 36 Δt <= 83, with Δt=2, 36*2=72, 72 <=83? 72 <=83 yes, and 0 <= h + s Δt = -48 + 72 = 24? Let's compute.\n\nAt Δt, position: left end: τ + s Δt = -83 + 36 Δt\n\nRight end: h + s Δt = -48 + 36 Δt\n\nOccupied when left <= 0 <= right, so -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nSo -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2 since integer\n\n0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 36 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >= 2\n\nThus for Δt=2, both: -83 + 72 = -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -48 +72=24 true, yes.\n\nFor Δt=1: -83 +36= -47 <=0 true, 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not occupied.\n\nΔt=0: -83 <=0 true, 0 <= -48 false.\n\nΔt=3: -83 +108=25 <=0? 25<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, occupied for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same parameters, so occupied only at Δt=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nτ= -71, h= -48, s=24\n\nOccupied when:\n\n-71 + 24 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt\n\nFirst: -71 +24 Δt <=0 => 24 Δt <=71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +24 Δt => 24 Δt >=48 => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 4) head=48, tail=37? For right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ=37? In the notation, it says (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this car, head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nSince right, tail should be left, head right, so τ=37, h=48.\n\nIn the list: (48, 37, right, 4), so I think first number is head, second is tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head is right end, tail is left end, so span [tail, head] = [37, 48] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12, 1, right, 4), so head=12, tail=1, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 4), head=-24, tail=-35, span [-35, -24]\n\nNow at time T, with Δt = T - t₁.\n\nFor first car: span [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt]\n\nOccupied if 37 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 4 Δt? But 37 +4Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 <= something positive always true, but 37 +4Δt <=0? 37+4Δt >=37>0, so never <=0, so this car never has left end <=0 since min is 37>0. So never occupied at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: span [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\n1 +4Δt >=1>0, so left end >0, never <=0, so never occupied at x=0.\n\nThird car: span [-35 + 4 Δt, -24 + 4 Δt]\n\nOccupied if -35 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst: -35 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/4 = 8.75, so Δt <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +4Δt => 4Δt >=24 => Δt >=6\n\nSo for Δt from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, same thing.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, when x=0 is occupied.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied at Δt=2\n\ny=2: freeway 2, occupied at Δt=2\n\ny=3: freeway 3, occupied at Δt=2\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied at Δt=2\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied at Δt=2\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied at Δt=2\n\ny=7: freeway 7, occupied when Δt=6,7,8 (from third car)\n\ny=8: freeway 8, occupied when Δt=6,7,8\n\nNow, at time Δt=0, which is t=22, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI must pass through rows 1 to 8, but I can stay on a row or move.\n\nCollision only when I am on a row at a time when it is occupied.\n\nFor example, if I am on row y at time Δt, and y is occupied at that Δt, I collide.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nI start at Δt=0, y=0.\n\nI take actions at each turn to change y.\n\ny_{τ} at time Δt=τ.\n\nSet τ as the time index from 0.\n\nAt time τ (relative), position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ taken at time τ, affects y_{τ+1}.\n\na_τ determines Δy to y_{τ+1}.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nAt time τ, I am on row y_τ, and I check if row y_τ is occupied at time τ.\n\nTime τ corresponds to absolute time t₁ + τ.\n\nFor collision at time τ, it depends on the row I am on at that time.\n\nI need for each τ and y, whether row y is occupied at time τ.\n\nBut y depends on my path.\n\nTo find a path with minimal H such that y_H =9, and for all τ from 0 to H-1, at time τ, when I am on y_τ, it is not occupied at that time τ.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ, row y_τ must not be occupied at time τ.\n\nThen at time H, y_H=9, which is safe.\n\nSince y_H=9, and we are at that position, but since no cars, it's fine.\n\nNow, the occupancy depends only on time, not on my position, for each row separately.\n\nFor each row and each time τ, we can compute if occupied.\n\nτ is relative to t₁.\n\nDefine for each row k and time τ (relative), occupied or not.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor row 1: occ at τ=2\n\nRow 2: occ at τ=2\n\nRow 3: occ at τ=2\n\nRow 4: occ at τ=2\n\nRow 5: occ at τ=2\n\nRow 6: occ at τ=2\n\nRow 7: occ at τ=6,7,8\n\nRow 8: occ at τ=6,7,8\n\nFor other times, not occupied.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=H.\n\nI can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since I need to go up, down might not help, but I might need to wait.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nThe shortest path would be to go up every turn, so from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, so H=9, at τ=9, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if during this path, I avoid collisions.\n\nAt each τ, I am on y=τ, since I start at y=0, and go up each turn.\n\ny_τ at time τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_0: U, so y_1 = y_0 +1 =1 at time τ=1.\n\nAt time τ=1, position y=1.\n\nIs row 1 occupied at τ=1? From above, row 1 occupied only at τ=2, not at τ=1, so safe.\n\nThen a_1: U, y_2=2 at time τ=2.\n\nAt time τ=2, y=2, row 2 occupied at τ=2? Yes, row 2 occupied at τ=2, so collision!\n\nOh, so at τ=2, if I am on row 2, it is occupied, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go straight up, at τ=2, I would be on row 2, which is occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nI need to avoid being on rows 1-6 at τ=2? Rows 1 to 6 are all occupied at τ=2.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt τ=2, rows 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all occupied.\n\nRow 7 and 8 not occupied at τ=2, since only at τ=6,7,8 for them.\n\nBut I start from y=0, at τ=0.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at τ=1, but at τ=1, row 1 is not occupied, as we saw.\n\nThen at τ=2, if I am on row 2, occupied.\n\nBut I can choose not to move up at that point.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, I am on y=1.\n\nInstead of going up to y=2 at τ=2, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSince all rows 1-6 are occupied at τ=2, I must not be on any of rows 1 to 6 at time τ=2.\n\nThat means at time τ=2, I must be on y=0 or y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but y=9 is target, I might not be there yet.\n\ny=0,7,8,9 are safe at τ=2.\n\ny=0: no cars\n\ny=7: at τ=2, not occupied, since occupied only at 6,7,8? τ=6,7,8 for row 7.\n\nAt τ=2, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\ny=9 no cars.\n\nBut I start at y=0, τ=0.\n\nNow, at τ=2, I need to be on a safe row: y=0,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is far, I might not reach by τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8.\n\nI could be on y=0.\n\nFor example, I could stay at y=0 for a few turns.\n\nBut that increases time.\n\nSince the danger is only at τ=2 for rows 1-6, and later at τ=6,7,8 for rows 7-8.\n\nFirst, let's handle τ=2.\n\nTo avoid being on rows 1-6 at τ=2, I have options:\n\n- Stay at y=0 until after τ=2.\n\n- Or go up quickly to y=7 or higher before τ=2.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=7, I need at least 7 up moves, but τ=2 is only 2 steps away.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter one action, at τ=1, y<=1\n\nAfter two actions, at τ=2, y<=2, so I can be at y=0,1,2 at τ=2.\n\ny=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are both occupied at τ=2 if I am on them.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo at τ=2, I can only be on y=0 to be safe, since y=1 and y=2 are occupied.\n\ny=2 is row 2, occupied at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at τ=2 would be occupied, but can I be on y=1 at τ=2?\n\nAt τ=2, position y_2.\n\nIf y_2=1, then row 1 occupied at τ=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly y_2=2, row 2 occupied, collision.\n\ny_2=0, safe.\n\nBut y_2 could be other values, but at τ=2, since I start from y=0, after two actions, y_2 <=2, so y_2 can be 0,1,2 only.\n\nThus, to be safe at τ=2, I must have y_2 = 0.\n\nThat means I must not move up in the first two turns.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt τ=0, action a_0: must be S or D, so that y_1 <=0, but y_1 >=0, so y_1=0 if S or D? y_0=0.\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nIf a_0 = U, y_1=1\n\nIf a_0 = S, y_1=0\n\nIf a_0 = D, y_1 = -1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=-1, not allowed, so I think D is not possible when y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U not possible.\n\nSo from y=0, possible actions: U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly to y=9, D or S, not U.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=0, a_0 can be U or S.\n\nIf U, y_1=1\n\nIf S, y_1=0\n\nThen at τ=1, if y_1=1, then a_1: U, S, or D.\n\nIf U, y_2=2\n\nIf S, y_2=1\n\nIf D, y_2=0\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=1, y_1=0, then a_1: U or S, y_2=1 or 0.\n\nNow, at τ=2, y_2 must be 0 to be safe, as above.\n\nSo y_2=0.\n\nHow to achieve y_2=0.\n\nPossibilities:\n\n- a_0 = S, y_1=0; then a_1 = S, y_2=0\n\n- a_0 = S, y_1=0; a_1 = D? But y_1=0, D to y_2=-1 not allowed, so only S.\n\n- Or a_0 = U, y_1=1; then a_1 = D, y_2=0\n\n- Or a_0 = U, y_1=1; a_1 = S, y_2=1 not good; a_1=U, y_2=2 not good.\n\nSo only two ways to have y_2=0:\n\n1. a_0 = S, a_1 = S: then y_1=0, y_2=0\n\n2. a_0 = U, a_1 = D: then y_1=1, y_2=0\n\nIn both cases, at τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, after that, I need to go up.\n\nBut there is another danger at τ=6,7,8 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's get past τ=2.\n\nSuppose I do one of these.\n\nI need minimal H, so I should choose the way that allows me to go up faster.\n\nIn option 1: stay at y=0 for two turns, then at τ=2, y=0.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nIn option 2: go up to y=1 at τ=1, then down to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, when I am on y=1, is it safe? Row 1 occupied only at τ=2, not at τ=1, so at τ=1, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, in terms of progress, in option 2, I was at y=1 at τ=1, but then back to y=0 at τ=2, so no net progress, same as staying.\n\nBut for minimal time, both have y=0 at τ=2, same position.\n\nNow, from τ=2, y=0, I need to go to y=9.\n\nI can start going up.\n\nBut I need to handle rows 7 and 8 which are occupied at τ=6,7,8.\n\nFirst, let's see the time.\n\nI need to be careful when I reach rows 7 and 8.\n\nSpecifically, row 7 and 8 occupied at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo I should not be on row 7 or 8 at times τ=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, I must avoid being on y=7 at τ=6,7,8 or y=8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, from τ=2, y=0, I need to go up.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 up moves, but I might need to wait.\n\nNow, let τ_current =2, y=0.\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut with constraints at τ=6,7,8 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nFirst, let's find when I can be on which rows.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only occupied at τ=2, and other times not, so after τ=2, they are safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7-8 occupied only at τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, from τ=2, y=0.\n\nI need to go through rows 1 to 8 to reach 9.\n\nThe critical part is around τ=6,7,8.\n\nI need to plan when to be on rows 7 and 8.\n\nSpecifically, I should not be on y=7 at τ=6,7,8; similarly for y=8.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 only at τ not in {6,7,8}, i.e., τ<=5 or τ>=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, since I need to go up, I might pass through them quickly or wait.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go up when possible.\n\nFirst, from τ=2, y=0, I can start going up.\n\nAt τ=2, I am at y=0, about to take action a_2.\n\nAfter a_2, at τ=3, y_3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some H.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9: if I go up every turn from τ=2, then:\n\nAt τ=2, y=0\n\na_2: U, y_3=1 at τ=3\n\na_3: U, y_4=2 at τ=4\n\na_4: U, y_5=3 at τ=5\n\na_5: U, y_6=4 at τ=6\n\na_6: U, y_7=5 at τ=7? y_τ at time τ.\n\nAfter action at τ, position at τ+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timeline.\n\nAt time τ (relative), position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ taken, determines y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nAt time τ, I am on y_τ, and collision check based on y_τ and time τ.\n\nThen move to y_{τ+1} at time τ+1.\n\nIn this path:\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0=0\n\nWe have actions for τ=0 and τ=1 to set y_2=0.\n\nSuppose we take option: a_0=S, a_1=S, so y_1=0, y_2=0\n\nThen at τ=2, y_2=0\n\nNow, take a_2: U, then y_3=1 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, position y=1, row 1: occupied only at τ=2, not at τ=3, so safe.\n\na_3: U, y_4=2 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, row 2: occ only at τ=2, not τ=4, safe.\n\na_4: U, y_5=3 at τ=5\n\nSafe.\n\na_5: U, y_6=4 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, row 4: occ only at τ=2, not τ=6, safe.\n\na_6: U, y_7=5 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, y=5, row 5 occ only τ=2, not τ=7, safe.\n\na_7: U, y_8=6 at τ=8\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, row 6 occ only τ=2, not τ=8, safe.\n\na_8: U, y_9=7 at τ=9\n\nNow at τ=9, y=7, row 7: occupied at τ=6,7,8? τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=9, not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen a_9: U, y_10=8 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, y=8, row 8: occupied at τ=6,7,8, not τ=10, safe.\n\na_10: U, y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nAt τ=11, y=9, safe.\n\nSo I reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nH is such that at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nHere τ=11, so H=11 turns? τ from 0 to 11, but actions from τ=0 to 10.\n\ny_11 at τ=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to 10, that's 11 actions? τ=0,1,2,...,10, that's 11 steps.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, which is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t₁ to t₁ + H -1, and position at t₁ + H -1 is after action.\n\nIn relative, actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, position at τ=H.\n\nHere, to reach at τ=11, actions a_0 to a_{10}, so H=11.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nIn this path, with a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2 to a_10 all U? a_2 to a_10 is 9 actions, but from y=0 to y=9 needs 9 ups, but here from τ=2 y=0 to τ=11 y=9, with 9 ups, but we had two stays at beginning, so total 11 actions.\n\na_0 to a_10: 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut we have the other option: a_0=U, a_1=D, then y_0=0, a_0=U, y_1=1 at τ=1; then a_1=D, y_2=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there same as above, a_2 to a_10 U, y_11=9.\n\nSame H=11.\n\nBut in this case, at τ=1, y=1, which was safe, as row1 not occupied at τ=1.\n\nAnd at τ=2, y=0 safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut now, at τ=9, y=7, which is safe since τ=9 not in {6,7,8}.\n\nSimilarly, τ=10, y=8, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on higher rows earlier.\n\nBut at τ=2, I have to be at y=0.\n\nFrom there, the first possible time to reach y=9 is with 9 up moves, so at τ=11.\n\nBut I could go faster through the upper rows.\n\nFor example, if I can avoid the danger at τ=6,7,8 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn the above, I passed y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, both after τ=8, so safe.\n\nBut if I go faster, I might reach y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, from τ=2, y=0.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\ny_3=1 at τ=3\n\ny_4=2 at τ=4\n\ny_5=3 at τ=5\n\ny_6=4 at τ=6\n\nNow at τ=6, if I go up, y_7=5 at τ=7? y_τ at time τ.\n\nAfter a_5: U at τ=5, y_6=4? Let's sequence:\n\nτ=2: y_2=0\n\na_2: U, y_3=1 at τ=3\n\na_3: U, y_4=2 at τ=4\n\na_4: U, y_5=3 at τ=5\n\na_5: U, y_6=4 at τ=6\n\na_6: U, y_7=5 at τ=7\n\na_7: U, y_8=6 at τ=8\n\na_8: U, y_9=7 at τ=9\n\na_9: U, y_10=8 at τ=10\n\na_10: U, y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, at τ=6, y=4, safe.\n\nBut if I want to be on y=7 earlier, say at τ=5.\n\nBut from τ=2 y=0, to y=7, need 7 up moves, so earliest at τ=9, as above.\n\ny_τ at τ: at τ=2, y=0\n\nAfter 0 moves, y=0\n\nAfter 1 move, y<=1 at τ=3\n\nAfter 2 moves, y<=2 at τ=4\n\n...\n\nAfter k moves, y <= k at τ=2+k\n\nTo be at y=7 at time τ, need at least 7 up moves from τ=2.\n\nSo earliest at τ=2+7=9, y_9=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nIn this case, at τ=9, y=7, which is after τ=8, so safe, since row7 occupied only up to τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, τ=10 y=8 safe.\n\nBut what about row 8 at τ=8?\n\nIn this path, at τ=8, I am at y=6? y_8=6 at τ=8.\n\nRow 6 is safe at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=7, safe.\n\nNow, but row 7 is occupied at τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=6,7,8, if I were on y=7, it would be bad, but I am not, I am on lower rows.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut in this path, I pass y=7 at τ=9, which is fine.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start going up immediately after τ=2, but I need 9 steps to go from 0 to 9, so minimum τ=11 if I start from τ=2 at y=0.\n\nBut at the beginning, I used two turns to stay or go up-down, so from τ=0 to τ=2, I am still at y=0.\n\nSo total from start, to reach y=9, minimum 11 turns if I go directly after.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y at τ=2?\n\nEarlier I thought at τ=2, I must be at y=0, because if I go up, I might be at y=1 or 2, which are occupied at τ=2.\n\nBut y=2 is possible only if I go up twice, but at τ=2, y=2 is occupied.\n\nSimilarly y=1 occupied.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11, with y reached at τ=11.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for the first two turns, I can do S,S or U,D.\n\nIn terms of number, same.\n\nBut perhaps U,D is better or worse, but same H.\n\nNow, but I need to check the later part for rows 7-8.\n\nIn the above path, it seems fine.\n\nBut at τ=6,7,8, rows 7 and 8 are occupied, but in the path, I am not on them at that time.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, I am on y=4, which is row 4, not occupied at τ=6.\n\nSimilarly τ=7, y=5, row5 safe.\n\nτ=8, y=6, row6 safe.\n\nThen τ=9, y=7, row7 not occupied.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way to save time?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 before τ=6 or after τ=8.\n\nBut since I start from y=0 at τ=2, earliest y=7 at τ=9.\n\nAfter τ=8, which is fine.\n\nIf I go slower, I might be later.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFirst, for the beginning: I need a_0 and a_1 such that y_2=0.\n\nOption 1: a_0 = S, a_1 = S\n\nThen at τ=0, y=0, action S, so y_1=0 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, y=0, action S, y_2=0 at τ=2\n\nOption 2: a_0=U, a_1=D\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, U to y_1=1 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, D to y_2=0 at τ=2? But y=1, D to y=0, which is allowed.\n\nAt τ=1, position y=1, which is safe since row1 not occupied at τ=1.\n\nThen D to y=0.\n\nIn terms of actions, both require two actions to be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there, 9 U actions to reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nSo total 11 actions.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=22.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, for the U,D option, I have a down action, but it might be acceptable.\n\nSince both work, I can choose either.\n\nBut to minimize actions or something, but H is the same.\n\nPerhaps the S,S is simpler.\n\nBut let's see if with U,D, I can save time later? No, same.\n\nAnother thing: at the end, when I reach y=9, I might stop, but in this case, at τ=11, y=9.\n\nNow, but I need to handle rows 7-8.\n\nIn the path above, it seems fine.\n\nBut let's check if at some point I might be on row 7 or 8 at wrong time.\n\nFor example, if I go slower, but I go fast, so no.\n\nSuppose at some point I stay, but that would make H larger, so not better.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 before τ=11.\n\nBut from τ=0, to y=9, minimum 9 up moves, but I had to spend two turns to stay at y=0 due to τ=2 constraint.\n\nIf I could be at higher y at τ=0, but I start at y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=7 before τ=6, but from τ=0, to y=7, need at least 7 up moves.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter 7 moves, at τ=7, y<=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, if y=7, row7 occupied at τ=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach y=7 at τ=5, but earliest τ=7 for y=7, since from τ=0, after 7 actions, at τ=7 y_7.\n\ny_τ at τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 at τ=1, <=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_k at τ=k.\n\nTo have y_k =7, need k>=7, so at τ=7, y_7=7 possible.\n\nBut at τ=7, if on y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach at τ=5, impossible, min τ=7 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at min τ=8, but at τ=8, row8 occupied.\n\ny=9 at min τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=9, if on y=9, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at τ=9, I need to start from y=0 at τ=0 with 9 up moves.\n\nBut at τ=2, if I am on y=2, occupied, so I cannot go straight up.\n\nIf I go up continuously, at τ=2, y=2, collision.\n\nSo I must not be on rows 1-6 at τ=2, but since I start low, I must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThus, I cannot reach y=9 before τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, I can be at y=9.\n\nWith the path.\n\nNow, but in the upper part, with rows 7-8 occupied at τ=6,7,8.\n\nIn my path, I pass y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, both safe.\n\nBut could I pass earlier if I arrange differently?\n\nFor example, suppose I stay longer at some point to avoid.\n\nBut that would make H larger.\n\nFor instance, if I reach y=6 earlier and wait, but then I need to go through y=7 and y=8 when safe.\n\nBut since the danger is until τ=8, I can be on y=7 at τ=9 or later.\n\nEarliest is τ=9 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=9 directly.\n\nAnother idea: after τ=2, I could go up slower to time the arrival at upper rows.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, going slower is worse.\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=6 by some time, then wait until after τ=8 to go to y=7.\n\nBut y=6 is safe after τ=2, since row6 only occupied at τ=2.\n\nIn my earlier path, I am at y=6 at τ=8, which is after τ=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, I am at y=6, I can go to y=7 at τ=9, etc.\n\nIf I reach y=6 earlier, say at τ=6, then at τ=6, y=6, which is row6, not occupied at τ=6, safe.\n\nBut then if I go to y=7 at τ=7, but at τ=7, y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nI have to wait at y=6 or go down, but going down not helpful.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=6 until τ=9? But at τ=8, I can still be at y=6.\n\nThen at τ=8, action: if I go U, y_9=7 at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=6, action U to y_9=7 at τ=9.\n\nI could stay at y=6.\n\nBut if at τ=6, y=6, I can stay: a_6=S, then y_7=6 at τ=7\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=6 at τ=8\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=7 at τ=9\n\nThen same as before, but I wasted two turns staying, so y=9 at later time.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I go directly, I reach y=7 at τ=9 as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus, the fastest is with H=11.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nI need to specify from turn t_1=22.\n\nActions: for τ=0 to 10.\n\nFirst, for the beginning, I can choose S,S or U,D.\n\nPerhaps S,S is simpler.\n\nIn U,D, I use a down action, but it might be fine.\n\nSince the problem might expect one, I can do S,S.\n\nBut let's write both.\n\nFirst, with S,S:\n\nTurn t_1 (22): S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nThen Turn 24: U  (to y=1 at time 23? Absolute time.\n\nTurn relative: τ=0: turn 22, action a_22\n\nAfter action, at turn 23, position.\n\nSet absolute turn.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=22, position (0,0)\n\nAction a_{22} at turn 22, determines position at turn 23.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, we write actions at each turn.\n\nSo for turn 22: action\n\nThen turn 23: action\n\netc.\n\nWith S,S:\n\n- Turn 22: S  (stay, so at turn 23, position y=0)\n\n- Turn 23: S  (stay, at turn 24, y=0)\n\nNow at turn 24, time absolute t=24, relative τ=2, since t_1=22, τ= t - 22.\n\nAt τ=2, t=24, y=0.\n\nThen:\n\n- Turn 24: U  (so at turn 25, y=1)\n\n- Turn 25: U  (at turn 26, y=2)\n\n- Turn 26: U  (at turn 27, y=3)\n\n- Turn 27: U  (at turn 28, y=4)\n\n- Turn 28: U  (at turn 29, y=5)\n\n- Turn 29: U  (at turn 30, y=6)\n\n- Turn 30: U  (at turn 31, y=7)\n\nNow, at turn 31, absolute time t=31, relative τ=31-22=9, y=7.\n\nRow 7: at τ=9, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen:\n\n- Turn 31: U  (at turn 32, y=8)\n\nAt turn 32, t=32, τ=10, y=8, row 8 not occupied at τ=10, safe.\n\n- Turn 32: U  (at turn 33, y=9)\n\nAt turn 33, τ=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, actions from turn 22 to turn 32, that's 11 actions: turns 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\nH=11, actions at t=22 to t=22+H-1 = t=22 to 22+10=32, position at t=32+1? Let's see.\n\nAction at t, determines position at t+1.\n\nAfter last action at t=32, position at t=33 is y=9.\n\nt=33 is turn 22 + 11, since τ=11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns: t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=22, H=11, so actions from 22 to 22+10=32.\n\nAnd position at turn t_1 + H -1 +1? After action at t, position at t+1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, position at (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nWe want position at t_1 + H to be 9.\n\nHere, after action at 32, position at 33 = 22 + 11 = t_1 + H, yes.\n\nWith U,D option:\n\n- Turn 22: U  (at turn 23, y=1)\n\n- Turn 23: D  (at turn 24, y=0)\n\nThen same as before from turn 24.\n\nAt turn 23, position y=1, time t=23, τ=1, row1 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen D to y=0 at t=24.\n\nThen from turn 24 same actions.\n\nBut with U,D, I have a down action, but it works.\n\nIn terms of number, same H.\n\nPerhaps I should output one.\n\nIn the car state, for rows 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but in this path, I didn't encounter issues.\n\nBut let's confirm if at some point I might be on a row when occupied.\n\nFor example, in the sequence above, at turn 31, position y=7 at t=31, τ=9, not occupied.\n\nBut is row 7 occupied at τ=9? No, only 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: when I am on a row, and move, but the collision is only when on the row at that time.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut can I reach in fewer than 11 turns?\n\nSuppose I use the U,D at beginning, but still same.\n\nAfter τ=2, if I could go faster, but I need 9 steps to go from 0 to 9.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at 0.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at τ=10 or something.\n\nBut from τ=2 y=0, min τ=11 for y=9.\n\ny at τ: at τ=2, y=0\n\nτ=3, y<=1\n\n...\n\nτ=10, y<=8\n\nτ=11, y<=9\n\nTo be at y=9 at τ=10, I need y=9 at τ=10, which requires at least 9 up moves from τ=2, so at τ=11, not τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y_10 <=10, but since y=9 max, y_10 <=9.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nTo have y_10=9, I need to be at y=8 or 9 at τ=9 and move accordingly.\n\nBut from τ=2 y=0, to y=9 at τ=10, I need to gain 9 in 8 steps (from τ=2 to τ=10, 8 actions?).\n\nActions from τ=2 to τ=9 for y_10.\n\ny_10 at τ=10.\n\nFrom y_2 at τ=2 to y_10 at τ=10, that's 8 actions.\n\nWith 8 actions, I can gain at most 8 in y, so y_10 <= y_2 + 8 = 0+8=8, so y_10 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 before τ=11.\n\nMinimal at τ=11.\n\nThus H=11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to write it.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions.\n\nAlso, for rows 7 and 8, in this path, no issue.\n\nBut let's list the actions clearly.\n\nI think S,S is fine.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U  // to y=7 at turn 31? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 22: action S, so at turn 23, position y=0? Position after action.\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nStart: turn 22, before action, position (0,0) I assume, but we take action.\n\nAt turn 22, position is (0,0), take action a_22.\n\nAfter action, at turn 23, new position.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn 22: take action S, so position at turn 23: (0,0)\n\n- At turn 23: take action S, position at turn 24: (0,0)\n\n- At turn 24: take action U, position at turn 25: (0,1)\n\n- At turn 25: take action U, position at turn 26: (0,2)\n\n- At turn 26: take action U, position at turn 27: (0,3)\n\n- At turn 27: take action U, position at turn 28: (0,4)\n\n- At turn 28: take action U, position at turn 29: (0,5)\n\n- At turn 29: take action U, position at turn 30: (0,6)\n\n- At turn 30: take action U, position at turn 31: (0,7)\n\nAt turn 31, position (0,7), time absolute t=31, relative τ=31-22=9.\n\nRow 7: occupied at τ=6,7,8, not 9, so safe.\n\n- At turn 31: take action U, position at turn 32: (0,8)\n\nAt turn 32, t=32, τ=10, y=8, row 8 not occupied at τ=10, safe.\n\n- At turn 32: take action U, position at turn 33: (0,9)\n\nReached.\n\nBut I need action at turn 32 to go to y=9, position at turn 33.\n\nActions from turn 22 to turn 32, that's 11 turns: 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 32, action U.\n\nIn the box, I need to write actions.\n\nWith U,D:\n\n- Turn 22: U, position at 23: (0,1)\n\n- Turn 23: D, position at 24: (0,0)\n\n- Turn 24: U, position at 25: (0,1)\n\n...\n\nSame as before, but at turn 23 I have D action.\n\nThen from turn 24 same.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 25 position (0,1), etc., same as above from turn 25.\n\nBut H still 11.\n\nI think S,S is cleaner.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nAnother point: in freeway 7, cars: I had one car that affects, but the others don't cover x=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and I have 11.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose I reach at τ=10.\n\nThen y_10=9 at τ=10.\n\nBut from start, at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, y_10=9.\n\nBut with actions from τ=0 to 9.\n\ny_10 at τ=10.\n\nNow, at τ=2, I need y_2=0.\n\ny_2 is at τ=2.\n\nWith actions a_0 to a_1 for y_2.\n\nIf I do U,D: a_0=U, a_1=D, then y_1=1, y_2=0.\n\nThen from there, I need to reach y=9 at τ=10, which is y_10=9.\n\nFrom y_2=0 at τ=2 to y_10 at τ=10, that's 8 actions.\n\nWith 8 actions, I can increase y by at most 8, so y_10 <= 0 + 8 =8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nIf I do S,S, y_2=0, same.\n\nThus impossible with H=10.\n\nH=10 means actions from t=22 to 22+9=31, position at t=32 should be y=9.\n\nt=32 is τ=10.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nBut to have y_10=9, I need to gain 9 from y_0=0 in 10 steps, but with the constraint at τ=2.\n\ny_10 = y_0 + sum of Δy from τ=0 to 9.\n\nBut y_0=0, y_10=9, so sum Δy =9.\n\nBut at τ=2, y_2 must be 0.\n\ny_2 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\nSince y_0=0, y_2 = Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\nAnd y_2=0, so Δy_0 + Δy_1 =0.\n\nThen y_10 = y_2 + sum_{τ=2 to 9} Δy_τ = 0 + sum_{τ=2 to 9} Δy_τ\n\nNow, from τ=2 to 9, that's 8 actions (τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), so 8 Δy, each at most +1, so y_10 <= 0 + 8 =8 <9.\n\nThus impossible to have y_10=9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nI think with S,S is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U  // to y=8 at turn 32? Let's list positions to confirm.\n\nTurn 22: action S, position at 23: (0,0)\n\nTurn 23: action S, position at 24: (0,0)\n\nTurn 24: action U, position at 25: (0,1)\n\nTurn 25: action U, position at 26: (0,2)\n\nTurn 26: action U, position at 27: (0,3)\n\nTurn 27: action U, position at 28: (0,4)\n\nTurn 28: action U, position at 29: (0,5)\n\nTurn 29: action U, position at 30: (0,6)\n\nTurn 30: action U, position at 31: (0,7)\n\nTurn 31: action U, position at 32: (0,8)\n\nTurn 32: action U, position at 33: (0,9)\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 31, action U, to go from y=7 to y=8.\n\nIn the list above, turn 30 action U to position (0,7) at turn 31.\n\nThen turn 31 action U to position (0,8) at turn 32.\n\nThen turn 32 action U to (0,9) at turn 33.\n\nActions: turn 22 to 32.\n\nFor the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 32: U\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars at τ=6,7,8, but I am not there.\n\nBut just to be thorough, for row 7 at τ=9, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid the dangerous time \\(\\tau = 2\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\)) when rows \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are occupied, and to avoid rows \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) during \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\) when they are occupied.\n\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 22), the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Actions \\(S\\) (stay) are taken for the first two turns to remain at \\(y = 0\\) during \\(\\tau = 2\\), avoiding collision with rows \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) which are occupied only at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- Starting from \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 24), the player moves up (\\(U\\)) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. This path ensures that the player is not on rows \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\) (when these rows are occupied), as the player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at \\(\\tau = 9\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 10\\), both safe times.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 22: \\(S\\) (stay, position at turn 23 is \\((0, 0)\\))\n- Turn 23: \\(S\\) (stay, position at turn 24 is \\((0, 0)\\))\n- Turn 24: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 25 is \\((0, 1)\\))\n- Turn 25: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 26 is \\((0, 2)\\))\n- Turn 26: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 27 is \\((0, 3)\\))\n- Turn 27: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 28 is \\((0, 4)\\))\n- Turn 28: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 29 is \\((0, 5)\\))\n- Turn 29: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 30 is \\((0, 6)\\))\n- Turn 30: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 31 is \\((0, 7)\\))\n- Turn 31: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 32 is \\((0, 8)\\))\n- Turn 32: \\(U\\) (up, position at turn 33 is \\((0, 9)\\))\n\nAt turn 33 (\\(t_1 + H = 22 + 11\\)), the position is \\((0, 9)\\), and no collisions occur during the sequence.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 22: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=24 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y=k, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only check the car on the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at any given turn, starting from t1=24.\n\nThe car positions are given at t1=24, and for future turns, I can calculate their spans.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T0 = 24.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T (for T >= T0) is:\n\nIf direction is right: span at T is [τ + s*(T - T0), h + s*(T - T0)]\n\nSince for right-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, and at T, it's [τ + s*(T-T0), h + s*(T-T0)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check the directions.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) — that seems odd. Head at -48, tail at -83? If it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Typically, for right-moving, we might think head is on the right, so if it's moving right, head should be larger.\n\nBut here, for freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -83. Since it's right-moving, and h = -48 > τ = -83, so head is at -48, tail at -83, so the car is from -83 to -48, which is length 35, I think? From -83 to -48 is 35 units? Let's calculate: difference is (-48) - (-83) = 35, so span length 35.\n\nThen at time T, position is [τ + s*(T-T0), h + s*(T-T0)] = [-83 + 36*(T-24), -48 + 36*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFor (48,37,right,4): head 48, tail 37? But 48 > 37, so if right-moving, head should be on the right, so tail at 37, head at 48, span [37,48] at T0.\n\nAt T, [37 + 4*(T-24), 48 + 4*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,4): tail 1, head 12, so [1,12] at T0, at T [1 + 4*(T-24), 12 + 4*(T-24)]\n\n(-24,-35,right,4): tail -35, head -24, so [-35,-24] at T0, at T [-35 + 4*(T-24), -24 + 4*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3 have the same car: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeways 4,5,6 have (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have the three cars each.\n\nI need to find when these cars have 0 in their span, meaning that at turn T, if I'm on that freeway, I collide if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nCollision if for freeway k at turn T, there is a car on k such that 0 is in [low, high] of its span at T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at T0=24, and I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so I can be there safely.\n\nThe game is to move from row to row.\n\nEach action changes my y position at the end of the turn.\n\nI need to minimize H, the number of turns, so I probably want to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the rows when cars are present at x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the times when x=0 is occupied change.\n\nFor each row, I need to find the times when it is safe to be on that row, meaning that at that turn, no car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, I need to plan a path from y=0 at T=24 to y=9 at some T, with minimal T-24.\n\nSince I move one row at a time, and each move takes one turn, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need at least 9 moves up, but I can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 9 if I have to wait.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, I should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably go up as fast as possible, only deviating if necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nBut I might need to stay or move down to wait for a safe time.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the set of turns when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we care about discrete turns.\n\nLet T be the turn number, starting from T0=24.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, compute for which T, 0 is in the car's span.\n\nThen, the row is unsafe at T if any car on it covers 0 at T.\n\nOtherwise, it is safe at T.\n\nThen, for the player to be on row y at turn T, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nNow, the player position: at turn T, after action, y_T is the position.\n\nThe action a_t determines Δy for turn t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nIn the update, y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nFor collision at turn T: if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and at that turn, for freeway k, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nAnd note that when I move, at the turn I move, I am on the starting row for collision check.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am at y_T, I choose action a_T, then I move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T, so collision check is for row y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on row y_{T+1}, check for that row at turn T+1.\n\nWhen I arrive at a row, I check at that turn.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=0 at T=24, no collision.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end, and at T_end, I am on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, to find minimal H such that I can go from T=24, y=0 to some T, y=9 in H turns, meaning T = 24 + t for t from 0 to H-1, with y_{24} = 0, and y_{24 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet me set the start as turn 0 for simplicity, relative to t1.\n\nSet τ = T - 24, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to find actions for τ=0 to τ=H-1, such that y_H = 9, with y_0 = 0.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H, with y_0=0, and after H turns, at time t=H, y_H=9.\n\nIn terms of indices: let t be the step, from t=0 to t=H-1, action a_t at time t, determines y_{t+1}.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time τ (relative), after τ actions, position y_τ.\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0 = 0\n\nAfter action a_0, at τ=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nGenerally, after action at τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nBut for collision: at time τ, position is y_τ, and we check if y_τ = k for k=1-8, and if 0 in car span on row k at time τ (absolute time T = 24 + τ)\n\nSince τ = T - 24, time from start.\n\nI'll use τ for simplicity.\n\nNow, for each row k=1 to 8, find for which τ, the row is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0 at time τ.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ_car = -83, dir right, s=36\n\nAt time τ (relative, τ=0 at T=24), absolute time T=24+τ\n\nSpan at T: since right-moving, low = τ_car + s*(T - 24) = -83 + 36*τ\n\nHigh = h + s*(T-24) = -48 + 36*τ\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high, i.e., -83 + 36τ <= 0 <= -48 + 36τ\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36τ <= 0 => 36τ <= 83 => τ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ <= 2 since τ integer\n\nτ <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2? But inequality is <=, so for τ <=2, -83+36τ <=0\n\n-83 +36τ <=0 when 36τ <=83, τ <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so for τ=0,1,2: -83 +36*0 = -83 <=0, -83+36= -47<=0, -83+72= -11<=0? 36*2=72, -83+72= -11 <=0 yes.\n\nτ=3: -83+108=25>0, so -83+36τ >0 for τ>=3.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36τ => 48 <= 36τ => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ >= 2 since τ integer? τ >= ceil(4/3)=2\n\n0 <= -48 +36τ => 36τ >=48 => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so for τ>=2, since τ=1: -48+36= -12 <0, not >=0; τ=2: -48+72=24>=0 yes.\n\nSo 0 in span when both: low <=0 and 0<=high.\n\nlow <=0: -83+36τ <=0 for τ <=2 (since τ=0,1,2)\n\n0<=high: 0<= -48+36τ for τ>=2 (τ=2,3,...)\n\nFor τ=2: low = -83+72= -11 <=0, high= -48+72=24 >=0, so yes.\n\nFor τ=1: low= -83+36= -47 <=0, high= -48+36= -12 <0, so 0 <= high false, 0 not <= -12? 0 > -12, so 0 not in [-47,-12], since -12<0.\n\nSimilarly, τ=0: low=-83, high=-48, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: low=-83+108=25>0, high= -48+108=60>0, so low>0, 0 not <= low? 0 < low, so not in [25,60].\n\nSo only at τ=2, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nτ=2 relative, absolute T=26.\n\nNow, freeway 2: same car as freeway 1? \"2 | (-48, -83, right, 36)\" same as freeway 1, so same thing, unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nh=-48? head -48, tail τ_car=-71\n\nRight-moving, so low = τ_car + sτ = -71 + 24τ\n\nHigh = h + sτ = -48 + 24τ\n\n0 in span if -71 +24τ <=0 <= -48 +24τ\n\nFirst, -71+24τ <=0 => 24τ <=71 => τ <=71/24≈2.958, so τ<=2 (since τ=0,1,2: -71<=0, -71+24=-47<=0, -71+48=-23<=0; τ=3: -71+72=1>0)\n\nSecond, 0<= -48+24τ => 24τ >=48 => τ>=2\n\nSo for τ=2: low=-71+48= -23 <=0, high=-48+48=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\n-48+24*2= -48+48=0, so high=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nFor τ=1: low=-71+24= -47<=0, high=-48+24= -24 <0, 0 not <= high.\n\nτ=3: low=-71+72=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only τ=2 unsafe for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) — head 48, tail 37? Since right, tail should be left, so if head=48, tail=37, then at T0, span [37,48]\n\nAt time τ, low = 37 + 4τ\n\nHigh = 48 + 4τ\n\n0 in span? low=37+4τ >0 for all τ>=0, since min at τ=0 is 37>0, so always positive, never covers 0. So safe for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4) tail=1, head=12, at τ, low=1+4τ, high=12+4τ\n\n1+4τ >=1>0 for τ>=0, so always positive, never 0, so safe.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) tail=-35, head=-24, at τ, low=-35 +4τ, high=-24 +4τ\n\n0 in span if -35+4τ <=0 <= -24+4τ\n\nFirst, -35+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=35 => τ <=35/4=8.75, so τ<=8\n\nSecond, 0<= -24+4τ => 4τ >=24 => τ>=6\n\nSo for τ=6,7,8\n\nτ=6: low=-35+24= -11 <=0, high=-24+24=0 <=0? 0<=0 true\n\nτ=7: low=-35+28= -7 <=0, high=-24+28=4 >=0\n\nτ=8: low=-35+32= -3 <=0, high=-24+32=8 >=0\n\nτ=9: low=-35+36=1>0, not\n\nτ=5: low=-35+20= -15<=0, high=-24+20= -4 <0, 0 not <= high\n\nSo unsafe at τ=6,7,8\n\nBut this is only for the third car. Since other cars don't cover 0, freeway 7 is unsafe when this car covers 0, so at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has the same cars as freeway 7, so same unsafe times: τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, unsafe at τ:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 2: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 3: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 4: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 5: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 6: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 7: unsafe at τ=6,7,8\n\nRow 8: unsafe at τ=6,7,8\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nFor row 1 to 6, only unsafe at τ=2, and rows 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nI need to go from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 moves up, but I can take more turns if I stay or move down.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, I should aim for H=9, meaning I move up every turn, from τ=0 to τ=8, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nCheck for each row and time.\n\nSuppose I move up at every turn: actions all U.\n\nThen y_τ = τ for τ=0 to 8? At τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, at τ=1, y=1\n\nAfter a_1=U, τ=2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_8=U, τ=9, y=9\n\nBut y_τ is position at time τ.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nFor collision at time τ, on row y_τ.\n\nNow, with all U:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nτ=1: y=1, row 1. Is row 1 unsafe at τ=1? From above, row 1 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=1, safe. So ok.\n\nτ=2: y=2, row 2. Row 2 unsafe at τ=2? Yes, row 2 is unsafe at τ=2. So if I am on row 2 at τ=2, I collide.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on any row 1-6 at τ=2, it would be unsafe, but since y=2 at τ=2, row 2 is unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 2 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on any row 1-6 at τ=2, but since I'm moving up, at τ=2 I am on row 2.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly up at τ=2.\n\nNow, at τ=6,7,8, rows 7 and 8 are unsafe.\n\nBut with all U, at τ=6, y=6, row 6 is not unsafe at τ=6 (only unsafe at τ=2, and row 6 unsafe only at τ=2, which is past), so at τ=6, row 6 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=7, y=7, row 7 unsafe at τ=7, so collision.\n\nWith all U:\n\nτ=6: y=6, row 6. Row 6 unsafe only at τ=2, not at τ=6, so safe.\n\nτ=7: y=7, row 7. Row 7 unsafe at τ=7? Yes, τ=6,7,8 unsafe for row 7. So at τ=7, unsafe, collide.\n\nSimilarly, τ=8: y=8, row 8 unsafe at τ=8, collide.\n\nτ=9: y=9, safe.\n\nSo with all U, I collide at τ=2, τ=7, τ=8.\n\nSpecifically at τ=2,7,8.\n\nBut τ=2 is early.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on rows 1-6 at τ=2, and avoid rows 7-8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only unsafe at τ=2, and rows 7-8 unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible, but skip the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, for τ=2, I need not to be on any row 1-6 at that time.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible ways: either I am below row 1 or above row 6 at τ=2.\n\nBut y=0 is below, or y=7 or above.\n\nBut at τ=2, if I am at y=0, that means I stayed or moved down, but I want to go up.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=7 at τ=2, but to reach y=7 at τ=2, I need to have moved up twice, but at τ=0 y=0, after one up, τ=1 y=1, after another up, τ=2 y=2, which is row 2, unsafe. I cannot be at y=7 at τ=2 because it takes at least 7 moves to get to y=7, but at τ=2, I can be at most y=2 if all up.\n\ny_τ: at τ=0, y=0\n\nτ=1, y<=1\n\nτ=2, y<=2\n\nSo at τ=2, possible y=0,1,2.\n\nNone of which is above 6, so the only safe position at τ=2 is y=0, since y=1 or 2 are rows 1 or 2, both unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, safe.\n\ny=1 or 2 are unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo to be safe at τ=2, I must be at y=0.\n\nThat means I need to stay at y=0 for τ=2 or move down, but since I start at y=0, I need to not move up at τ=0 or τ=1? Let's see the actions.\n\nAt τ=0, I take action a_0, which affects y_1.\n\nPosition at time τ is y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y_0=0, no action yet? Let's clarify the sequence.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt time τ=0 (absolute T=24), position y=0.\n\nI take action a_0.\n\nThen, after action, at time τ=1, position y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nSimilarly, at time τ, I take action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nCollision at time τ: based on y_τ and the cars at time τ.\n\nAt time τ=0, y_0=0, safe, no issue.\n\nAfter taking a_0, we go to τ=1 with y_1.\n\nAt τ=1, if y_1=k for k=1-8, and unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly for each τ.\n\nFor τ=2 specifically, at time τ=2, y_2 must not be in 1-6, but since y_2 <=2, only possible safe is y_2=0.\n\ny_2=0 means I didn't move up in the first two moves.\n\nSimilarly, for the later times.\n\nFirst, to avoid τ=2 issue, I must have y_2 = 0.\n\nThat means at τ=0 and τ=1, I must not move up, so either S or D.\n\nBut y_0=0, if I do S at τ=0, y_1=0\n\nThen at τ=1, if I do S or D, y_2=0 or -1, but y cannot be below 0, so if y_1=0, and I do D, y_2 = -1, not allowed, must stay >=0.\n\nSo possible: at τ=0, action S or D.\n\nIf D, y_1 = 0 + (-1) = -1, invalid, so I cannot do D at τ=0 because y=0, down to -1 not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, at any y=0, I cannot do D, only S or U.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot do U.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=0, possible actions: U or S.\n\nIf U, y_1=1\n\nIf S, y_1=0\n\nNow, for y_2 to be 0.\n\nIf I do S at τ=0, y_1=0\n\nThen at τ=1, I can do S, then y_2=0\n\nOr if I do U at τ=0, y_1=1, then at τ=1, I must do D to get to y_2=0, but from y=1, D to y=0, so y_2=0.\n\nBut at τ=1, when I am at y_1=1, and I take action, but collision at τ=1 is for position y_1.\n\nIf I go to y_1=1 at τ=1, row 1 at τ=1.\n\nIs row 1 unsafe at τ=1? From above, row 1 unsafe only at τ=2, not at τ=1. Earlier we have row 1 safe at τ=1, unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, row 1 is safe, since unsafe only τ=2.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, for row 1, unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, for row 1: low = -83 +36*1 = -47, high=-48+36= -12, both <0, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows at τ=1 are safe except possibly, but rows 1-6 all unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, all rows safe, since only τ=2 is issue for them.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7-8 unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo back to point.\n\nTo have y_2=0, I can:\n\n- Option 1: at τ=0, S, then y_1=0; then at τ=1, S, then y_2=0\n\n- Option 2: at τ=0, U, then y_1=1; then at τ=1, D, then y_2=0 (since from y=1 down to 0)\n\nIn option 2, at τ=1, y_1=1, which is row 1, but safe at τ=1, so no collision.\n\nThen y_2=0, safe.\n\nNow, for minimal time, option 2 takes me to y=1 and back, wasting time, whereas option 1 stays at y=0, also not progressing.\n\nBut in both cases, at τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nNow, I also have later issues at τ=6,7,8 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's get past τ=2.\n\nAfter τ=2, y=0, I need to go up.\n\nBut rows 1-6 are only unsafe at τ=2, so after that, they are always safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7 and 8 are unsafe at τ=6,7,8, but safe otherwise.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFrom τ=2, y=0, I can move up.\n\nBut I need to be careful around τ=6,7,8.\n\nSpecifically, I need to not be on row 7 or 8 at τ=6,7, or 8.\n\nThat means, at time τ=6, y_6 should not be 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly at τ=7, y_7 not 7 or 8.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8 not 7 or 8.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are the only ones unsafe at those times.\n\nNow, possible safe positions: at τ=6, y_6 can be 0-6 or 9, but since y=9 might not be reached yet, or 7,8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y_6 <=6 or y_6=9, but y=9 at τ=6 requires moving up 6 times from start, but with delay, it might not be possible yet.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nTo avoid collision at τ=2, I must have y_2=0.\n\nAs above.\n\nSo I need to spend the first two turns to stay at or return to y=0.\n\nMinimal way: I can do S at τ=0 and S at τ=1, so y_1=0, y_2=0.\n\nOr U at τ=0 then D at τ=1, y_1=1, y_2=0, but that takes me to y=1 and back, same time, but I have an extra move, but since I end at y=2=0, same as staying.\n\nBut in terms of position, at τ=1 I was at y=1, which is fine, but it doesn't progress.\n\nTo save time, better to just stay, so actions S,S for first two turns? But I need to specify.\n\nSince both options take two turns to be at y=0 at τ=2, and S,S is simpler, no move.\n\nBut with S,S: at τ=0, action S, y_1=0\n\nτ=1, action S, y_2=0\n\nAt τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nWith minimal turns.\n\nFrom τ=2, y=0, to y=9, at least 9 moves up, so minimum τ=11 to reach y=9? At τ=2, y=0.\n\nAfter k up moves, y = k, at time τ=2+k.\n\nSet when I start moving up.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0.\n\nI take action at τ=2, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 up moves, taking at least 9 turns from τ=2.\n\nSo earliest possible at τ=11, y=9? At τ=2, after action, y_{3} could be 1 if I move up.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action at τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nAt τ=2, y_2=0\n\nI take action a_2.\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nIf S, y_3=0, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some time.\n\nLet T_reach be the time when y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nT_reach >= τ=2 + 9 =11 if all up, but might be more.\n\nBut I have constraints at τ=6,7,8.\n\nτ=6,7,8 absolute from start, but since I delayed, τ=6 is later.\n\nτ is relative to start, so τ=6 corresponds to absolute T=24+6=30.\n\nBut in relative, τ=6.\n\nAt time τ=6, I need y_6 not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, τ=7, y_7 not 7 or 8.\n\nτ=8, y_8 not 7 or 8.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are unsafe only at these times, other times safe.\n\nNow, y_6, y_7, y_8 must each not be 7 or 8.\n\nPossible values: y can be from 0 to 9, but not 7 or 8 at those times.\n\nAlso, since I am moving up, y should be increasing roughly.\n\nNow, from τ=2, y=0, I can start moving up.\n\nSuppose I move up as much as possible.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\nNow at τ=6, y_6=4, which is row 4, but row 4 is safe at τ=6, since only unsafe at τ=2. And 4 not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nAt τ=7, y_7=5, row 5, safe, not 7 or 8.\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nAt τ=8, y_8=6, row 6, safe, not 7 or 8.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nAt τ=9, y_9=7, row 7 at τ=9.\n\nIs row 7 unsafe at τ=9? From above, row 7 unsafe at τ=6,7,8, not at τ=9.\n\nSince τ=9 >8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_9=U, y_{10}=8\n\nAt τ=10, y_{10}=8, row 8 at τ=10, unsafe? Row 8 unsafe at τ=6,7,8, τ=10>8, safe.\n\nThen a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9\n\nAt τ=11, y_{11}=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nList positions over time:\n\nτ=0: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\nτ=1: with actions, in this path, I need to specify actions from start.\n\nIn this path, I assumed from τ=2 onwards, but I have τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nEarlier to have y_2=0, I need to do something at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nFor example, I can do:\n\nAt τ=0: S (so y_1=0)\n\nτ=1: S (y_2=0)\n\nThen τ=2: U (y_3=1)\n\nτ=3: U (y_4=2)\n\nτ=4: U (y_5=3)\n\nτ=5: U (y_6=4)  // at τ=6, y=4\n\nτ=6: U (y_7=5)\n\nτ=7: U (y_8=6)  // at τ=8, y=6\n\nτ=8: U (y_9=7)\n\nτ=9: U (y_{10}=8)\n\nτ=10: U (y_{11}=9)\n\nNow, check at each τ:\n\nτ=0: y=0, safe\n\nτ=1: y=0 (since S at τ=0, y_1=0), not freeway, safe? y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision, safe.\n\nτ=2: y=0, safe\n\nτ=3: y=1, row 1. At τ=3, row 1 safe? Yes, only unsafe at τ=2.\n\nτ=4: y=2, row 2, at τ=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=5: y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nτ=6: y=4, row 4, safe (row 4 unsafe only τ=2)\n\nτ=7: y=5, row 5, safe\n\nτ=8: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nτ=9: y=7, row 7. At τ=9, row 7 unsafe? From above, row 7 unsafe at τ=6,7,8. τ=9>8, so should be safe.\n\nFor row 7, third car: unsafe when τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=9, low = -35 +4*9 = -35+36=1>0, high=-24+36=12>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 same.\n\nτ=10: y=8, row 8 at τ=10, low for cars: for example, third car low=-35+40=5>0, etc., safe.\n\nτ=11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo no collisions, and I reach at τ=11, y=11? y_{11}=9.\n\nTime from τ=0 to τ=11, so 11 turns? τ from 0 to 10 actions, 11 steps.\n\nNumber of turns H: from start to end, H actions to go from y_0 to y_H.\n\ny_0 at τ=0, y_H at τ=H.\n\nIn this case, y_0=0, y_{11}=9, so after 11 actions, reached at τ=11.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nEarlier I used two turns to stay at y=0 for τ=1 and τ=2.\n\nBut I could have gone up and down.\n\nFor example, at τ=0: U, so y_1=1\n\nThen at τ=1: D, so y_2=0 (from y=1 down to 0)\n\nThen at τ=2: y=0, same as before.\n\nThen same as above, I reach at τ=11.\n\nBut at τ=1, I was at y=1, which is safe, but I end up at same time.\n\nNo gain.\n\nNow, about the later part: at τ=6,7,8 I have y=4,5,6, all below 7, so not on rows 7 or 8, safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 faster.\n\nMinimum possible: without delays, 9 moves, but I had to delay 2 turns, so 11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the delay at start.\n\nAt τ=2, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision, as y=1 or 2 are unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be at y=0 or above, but above not possible, so only y=0.\n\nSo I must lose at least two turns at start.\n\nThen from there, 9 moves up, total 11 turns.\n\nBut in the up moves, I might be able to go faster, but since I can only move one per turn, no.\n\nPerhaps at the rows 7 and 8, since they are unsafe at τ=6,7,8, but if I can be at y=7 earlier or later.\n\nIn my path, I reach y=7 at τ=9, which is after τ=8, so safe.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start moving up immediately.\n\nBut I have to deal with τ=2.\n\nSuppose at τ=0: U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1: since at τ=1, y=1 safe, but at τ=2, if I stay or move, if I move U, y_2=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I move S, y_2=1, row 1 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I move D, y_2=0, safe, but I was at y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo way to avoid spending two turns to be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nPerhaps I can be at higher y at τ=2, but impossible since max y=2 at τ=2.\n\ny=2 is unsafe.\n\nSo no, I must have y_2=0.\n\nThus, minimum H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the path I have:\n\nActions:\n\nτ=0 (t1+0): S\n\nτ=1 (t1+1): S\n\nτ=2 (t1+2): U\n\nτ=3 (t1+3): U\n\nτ=4 (t1+4): U\n\nτ=5 (t1+5): U\n\nτ=6 (t1+6): U\n\nτ=7 (t1+7): U\n\nτ=8 (t1+8): U\n\nτ=9 (t1+9): U\n\nτ=10 (t1+10): U\n\nThen at τ=11, y=9.\n\nH=11 turns? From τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions? Indices.\n\nStart: at τ=0, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at τ=H, y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nWith H actions.\n\nIn this case, from τ=0 to H, with actions at t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, y_H.\n\nSet actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nWith H actions, we reach y_H.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAction at t=0: S, y1=0\n\nt=1: S, y2=0\n\nt=2: U, y3=1\n\nt=3: U, y4=2\n\nt=4: U, y5=3\n\nt=5: U, y6=4\n\nt=6: U, y7=5\n\nt=7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8: U, y9=7\n\nt=9: U, y10=8\n\nt=10: U, y11=9\n\nSo y11=9 after 11 actions (t=0 to t=10), so H=11.\n\nNow, but at t=9 action, y10=8 at τ=10.\n\nIn terms of collision, we checked all safe.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output for absolute turns.\n\nt1=24.\n\nSo actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=11, so turns from 24 to 24+10=34.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nThen at turn 35, position (0,9), but we reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at turn T, position at turn T+1? I think I have confusion in indexing.\n\nAbsolute turn.\n\nAt turn T=24, position y=0.\n\nTake action a_{24}.\n\nThen at turn T=25, position y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy_{24}\n\nGenerally, at turn T, take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nCollision at turn T: based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt T=24, take a_{24}, then y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy\n\nBut at T=24, position is y_{24}=0, we take action a_{24}, then y_{25} is set.\n\nCollision at T=24: y_{24}=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen at T=25, position y_{25}, which depends on a_{24}.\n\nIn my relative, τ=0 is T=24, y=0.\n\nAfter a_0 at τ=0, y_1 at τ=1 (T=25)\n\nSo:\n\nT=24: y=0, take a_{24} (which is relative a_0)\n\nThen T=25: y_{25} = y_{24} + Δa_{24}, take a_{25}\n\nThen T=26: y_{26} = y_{25} + Δa_{25}, etc.\n\nCollision at T: if y_T = k for k=1-8, and unsafe at T.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nWith a_{24} = S (so Δy=0), then y_{25} = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nAt T=25, position y_{25}=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nTake a_{25}=S, then y_{26} = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nAt T=26, position y_{26}=0, safe? But T=26 absolute, relative τ=2.\n\ny_{26}=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nTake a_{26}=U, then y_{27} = 0 + 1 =1\n\nAt T=27, position y_{27}=1, row 1. Absolute T=27, relative τ=3 (since T=24 is τ=0, T=25 τ=1, T=26 τ=2, T=27 τ=3)\n\nAt τ=3, row 1 safe, as before.\n\nSimilarly, continue.\n\nAt T=30: absolute T=30, relative τ=6 (T=24+6=30)\n\ny_{30}: in sequence, from above, y_{30} = ? Let's list y_T.\n\nT=24: y=0\n\nAfter a_{24}=S, y_{25}=0\n\na_{25}=S, y_{26}=0\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=1\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=2\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=3\n\na_{29}=U, y_{30}=4\n\nAt T=30, position y_{30}=4, row 4, absolute T=30, relative τ=6.\n\nCars at τ=6: row 4 is safe, as unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, T=31: y_{31}=5 (after a_{30}=U? In actions, after y_{30}=4, take a_{30}=U, y_{31}=5)\n\nAt T=31, y_{31}=5, row 5, τ=7? T=31, τ=31-24=7\n\nAt τ=7, row 5 safe.\n\nT=32: y_{32}=6 (after a_{31}=U), position y_{32}=6, row 6, τ=8\n\nSafe.\n\nT=33: y_{33}=7 (after a_{32}=U), position y_{33}=7, row 7, τ=9\n\nτ=9, row 7 safe.\n\nT=34: y_{34}=8 (after a_{33}=U), position y_{34}=8, row 8, τ=10, safe.\n\nT=35: y_{35}=9 (after a_{34}=U), position y_{35}=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach at some turn, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=35, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start, but start at T=24.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{24 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, after 11 actions: from T=24 to T=34 actions, y_{35}=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nT=24 to T=34 inclusive is 11 actions?

At τ=8, y=6 as above.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 require y=7 or 8, which I am not at, so safe.\n\nIf I could be at y=9 before τ=6, but from y=0 at τ=2, earliest y=9 at τ=11, which is after.\n\nτ=11>8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach in 10 turns.\n\nSuppose H=10, so after 10 actions, y_{34}=9? T=24 start, after 10 actions up to T=33, y_{34}=9.\n\nBut y_{34}=9 means at turn 34, position (0,9).\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0 in 10 actions, I need exactly 9 up and one other, but since I need to avoid collision, probably have to have a stay or down.\n\nBut with H=10, y_{34}=9.\n\nNow, from start, at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, y_{10 relative} =9.\n\nBut I need y_τ for τ=2 to be 0.\n\nNow, with 10 actions to go to y=9.\n\nThe net displacement must be +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and let S be stays.\n\nLet U, D, S actions.\n\nThen Δy sum = number of U minus number of D =9.\n\nTotal actions H = U + D + S.\n\ny_final - y_initial = U - D =9.\n\nH = U + D + S.\n\nMinimal H when D=0, S=0, U=9, H=9.\n\nBut we have constraints.\n\nWith H=10, possible, for example, U=9, S=1 or U=10, D=1, etc., but y change must be +9, so U - D =9, and H = U + D + S.\n\nIf S=0, then U - D =9, U + D =10, so 2U =19, U=9.5, impossible.\n\nThus must have S or extra moves.\n\nU - D =9\n\nH = U + D + S\n\nSince U =9 + D, then H = (9 + D) + D + S = 9 + 2D + S\n\nFor H=10, 10 = 9 + 2D + S, so 1 = 2D + S\n\nThus either D=0, S=1 or D=1, S=0? 2D + S =1.\n\nSince D and S integers, possible: D=0, S=1 or D=1, S= -1 impossible, or S=1, D=0; or S=0, 2D=1, D=0.5 no.\n\nSo only possibility: D=0, S=1, U=9.\n\nOr D=1, S= -1 no.\n\nSo must have one stay and 9 ups, or if D=1, U=10, then U-D=9, but H=U+D+S=10+1+S=11+S, which for S=0, H=11>10.\n\nWith U=9, D=0, S=1, H=10.\n\ny change: +9 with 9U and 1S.\n\nNow, I need to have y_2=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter actions.\n\ny_τ depends on the sequence.\n\nSuppose I have one stay somewhere.\n\nBut at τ=2, y_2 must be 0.\n\nNow, from τ=0 to τ=2, positions.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter a0, y1 = y0 + Δa0\n\nAfter a1, y2 = y1 + Δa1\n\ny2 must be 0.\n\nSince y0=0, y2=0.\n\nPossible actions: if both a0 and a1 are S, then y1=0, y2=0.\n\nOr a0=U, then y1=1; then a1=D, y2=0.\n\nIn both cases, with U=9, D=0, S=1 for H=10.\n\nBut in the first case, if I do S at τ=0 and S at τ=1, then I have one S already used? H=10 actions include these.\n\nFor H=10, actions from t=0 to 9.\n\ny10=9.\n\nNow, with U=9, D=0, S=1.\n\nThe S can be at some point.\n\nBut at τ=2, y2 must be 0.\n\nCase 1: S at τ=0 and S at τ=1: but that uses two S, but I have only one S, contradiction.\n\nI have only one S to place.\n\nIf I place S at τ=0, then a0=S, y1=0\n\nThen a1 must be something, but y2 must be 0.\n\nIf a1=S, y2=0, but then I used two S, but I have only one S, since U=9, S=1, but if I use S at τ=0 and S at τ=1, that's two S, but I need only one S for the whole sequence.\n\nFor the whole 10 actions, U=9, S=1, D=0.\n\nSo only one stay.\n\nIf I use S at τ=0, then y1=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I need y2=0, so I must do S again or D, but D not allowed since D=0, or U would make y2=1, not 0.\n\nIf a1=U, y2=1 ≠0\n\nIf a1=S, y2=0, but then I used S at τ=0 and S at τ=1, that's two S, but I should have only one S.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf I do not S at τ=0, but U at τ=0, y1=1\n\nThen at τ=1, to have y2=0, I must do D, but D=0, no down allowed, only U or S.\n\nIf a1=D, but I have D=0, so cannot.\n\nThus impossible to have y2=0 with only one S and no D.\n\nTherefore, with H=10 and U=9, D=0, S=1, I cannot achieve y2=0 because it requires either two S or one U and one D in the first two actions.\n\nBut with the constraints, I cannot.\n\nIf I have D=1, U=10, then U-D=9, H=U+D+S=10+1+S=11+S, minimum H=11 with S=0.\n\nThen U=10, D=1, net +9.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nFor example, at some point move down and up, but takes more actions.\n\nBut in any case, H=11 is achievable, and H=10 seems impossible because to have net +9 in 10 actions, must have U=9, S=1, D=0, but cannot satisfy y2=0 without extra actions.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn my sequence, I have two S at start, but for H=11, I have U=9, S=2, D=0, so net +9 with 11 actions.\n\nActions: two S and nine U.\n\nIn the sequence, S at t=0 and t=1, then nine U from t=2 to t=10.\n\nt from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nIn terms of the answer.\n\nNow, for the later part, in my sequence, I pass row 7 at τ=9 (T=33), which is safe, and row 8 at τ=10 (T=34), safe.\n\nBut row 8 is also unsafe at τ=8, but I am not on it then.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nTo output the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and in the sequence, after last action, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=11, so turns 24 to 34.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we analyzed that only the third one matters, and we are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut is there a shorter path considering the later constraints?\n\nSuppose I move up faster after start, but I can't because of τ=2.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 longer, but that would take more time, worse.\n\nOr, for rows 7 and 8, since they are unsafe at τ=6,7,8, if I can be at y=6 at τ=5 or something, but from y=0 at τ=2, at τ=5, y at most 3.\n\nThen at τ=6, I can go to y=4, etc.\n\nBut I need to be at y=7 after τ=8.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point.\n\nBut in my current path, I reach at τ=11.\n\nSuppose at τ=2, y=0, I start moving up, but at some point, to avoid being on row 7 or 8 too early, but since I start late, I am not on them during τ=6,7,8.\n\nIf I could be on row 7 before τ=6, but from τ=2 y=0, at τ=6, I can be at y=4, as above, not 7.\n\nSo impossible to be on row 7 before τ=6 with this start.\n\nThus, no shorter path.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two S at beginning, but I could have U then D, but same H.\n\nBut with S and S, it's fine.\n\nNow, output.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but only one affects, as we saw.\n\nAlso, for other rows, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows 1-6 at relative turn \\(\\tau = 2\\) (absolute turn 26) and not on rows 7-8 at relative turns \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\) (absolute turns 30, 31, 32).\n\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 26), rows 1-6 are unsafe due to cars covering position \\(x=0\\).

The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=26, and I need to find where it is at future turns to avoid collisions. A collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's a vertical movement game on a grid, and cars are on horizontal freeways. The player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, when the player is at position (0, y_T), if y_T is a freeway (1-8), then we check if x=0 is in any car's span on that freeway at turn T. If it is, collision.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are not on the new row until the next turn. So if at turn T you are at y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter at turn T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, then you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, current turn is t_1=26, player at (0,0). I need to go to (0,9), which is above, so probably moving up is better, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at t=26.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed 36. Since direction is right, and span is given as (h, τ) with h and τ, but for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h]? Let me read carefully.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nNow, is this (h, τ) or (τ, h)? It says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nHead and tail: I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor a right-moving car, if it's moving right, the head should be on the right side, so if direction is right, head should be greater than tail.\n\nHere for freeway 1: h=-48, τ=-83, and since -48 > -83, so head is at -48, tail at -83, and direction right, so it's moving to increasing x, so at time T, position will be [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-83 + 36(T-26), -48 + 36(T-26)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h] at t1, so τ to h with τ < h.\n\nIn the input, it's listed as (h, τ, d, s), but for right-moving, h should be greater than τ, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 1: h=-48, τ=-83, so h > τ, since -48 > -83, so for right-moving, at t1, span is from τ=-83 to h=-48.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: same: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) so h=-48, τ=-71, but -48 > -71? -48 is greater than -71, yes, so τ=-71, h=-48, so span from -71 to -48 at t1.\n\nτ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nHere τ=-71, h=-48, so τ < h, good.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 6: same: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor each, let's find the span at t1.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37? But 48 > 37, so for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [37, 48]? But it says (48, 37, right, 4), and head=48, tail=37, so since moving right, head is at higher x, so tail at 37, head at 48, so span [37,48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12, 1, right, 4), so tail=1, head=12, span [1,12] at t1.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 4), h=-24, τ=-35, and -24 > -35, so tail at -35, head at -24, span [-35,-24] at t1.\n\nAll moving right.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nNow, t1=26.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=26.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least 9, since from 0 to 9, moving up each turn would take 9 turns, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 9 turns.\n\nAt turn T, when player is at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, we need that at that turn, no car on that freeway has span containing 0.\n\nSince cars move with constant speed, I can compute for each freeway and each time when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so for each freeway, at each time, I need to check if any car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t1.\n\nSet t = 0 at t1, so current time is t=0.\n\nAt t=0, player at y=0.\n\nWe need to find actions for t=0 to t=H-1, so from time 0 to H-1, and after H actions, at time H, player is at y=9.\n\nAfter t actions, at time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at time 0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at time 0, at time 1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y_H =9.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0, and after H steps, at t=H, y_H=9.\n\nActions a_t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nNow, collision: at time t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, and on freeway y_t, at time t, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nTime t is absolute time from some reference, but since t1=26, and we set t=0 at t1, so time t means turn number t1 + t.\n\nIn the car update, at time T, which is absolute.\n\nBut since t1=26, and we use relative time, let τ = T - t1, so at time offset τ, which is turns after t1.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t1.\n\nAt τ=0, player at (0,0)\n\nCars at τ=0:\n\nFreeway 1: right, s=36, span [τ, h] = [-83, -48] since for right-moving, at τ=0, span [τ_tail, h_head] = [-83, -48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same, [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same, [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: right, s=24, τ=-71, h=-48, span [-71, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: same, [-71, -48]\n\nFreeway 6: same, [-71, -48]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n\nCar1: right, s=4, span [37,48] at τ=0\n\nCar2: [1,12] at τ=0\n\nCar3: [-35,-24] at τ=0\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, at time τ, the span for a car:\n\nFor right-moving car with initial span [τ0, h0] at τ=0, at time τ, span is [τ0 + s*τ, h0 + s*τ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for freeway 1 car: initial τ0 = -83, h0 = -48, s=36\n\nAt time τ, span: [-83 + 36τ, -48 + 36τ]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3 same.\n\nFreeway 4: τ0=-71, h0=-48, s=24, span at τ: [-71 + 24τ, -48 + 24τ]\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7:\n\nCar1: τ0=37, h0=48, s=4, span at τ: [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ]\n\nCar2: τ0=1, h0=12, s=4, span at τ: [1 + 4τ, 12 + 4τ]\n\nCar3: τ0=-35, h0=-24, s=4, span at τ: [-35 + 4τ, -24 + 4τ]\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same.\n\nNow, for a freeway k, at time τ, we need to know if x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for some car, low <= 0 <= high, where [low, high] is the span.\n\nPlayer at time τ is at y_τ, and if y_τ = k for k=1 to 8, then collision if 0 is in some car's span on k at τ.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H.\n\ny changes by -1,0,1 each step.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, moving up is preferable, but we may need to wait or move down to avoid being on a row when a car is at 0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time when it is dangerous, i.e., when 0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars move fast for freeway 1-3 and 4-6, but slow for 7-8.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: span at τ: [-83 + 36τ, -48 + 36τ]\n\n0 is in span if -83 + 36τ <= 0 <= -48 + 36τ\n\nSo -83 + 36τ <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36τ\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36τ <= 0 => 36τ <= 83 => τ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ <= 2 since τ integer\n\nτ <= floor(83/36) = 2? 36*2=72, 83-72=11, so -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 <=0, yes\n\n-83 + 36*3 = -83 + 108 = 25 >0, so not <=0\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36τ => 48 <= 36τ => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ >= 2 since τ integer\n\nτ >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nAnd τ <=2 from above.\n\nSo both: τ >=2 and τ <=2, so only at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2: low = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n\nHigh = -48 + 72 = 24\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 24, yes.\n\nAt τ=1: low = -83 + 36 = -47, high = -48 + 36 = -12, both negative, 0 not in [-47,-12]\n\nAt τ=3: low = -83+108=25, high= -48+108=60, both positive, 0 not in [25,60]\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same, so freeway 1,2,3 dangerous only at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: s=24, τ0=-71, h0=-48\n\nSpan at τ: [-71 + 24τ, -48 + 24τ]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24τ <= 0 <= -48 + 24τ\n\nFirst: -71 + 24τ <= 0 => 24τ <= 71 => τ <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so τ <= 2? 24*2=48, 71-48=23, -71+48= -23 <=0, yes; τ=3: -71+72=1>0\n\n-71+24τ <=0 for τ <=2 since at τ=2, -71+48= -23<=0, τ=3, -71+72=1>0\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 24τ => 48 <= 24τ => τ >= 2\n\nSince 48/24=2.\n\nSo τ >=2 and τ <=2? τ <=2 from first, but τ <=2.958, so τ=2 or τ=3? Let's see.\n\nFirst inequality: -71 +24τ <=0 for τ <= 71/24≈2.958, so τ<=2 since τ integer? τ=2: -71+48= -23<=0, τ=3: -71+72=1>0, not <=0, so only for τ<=2.\n\nBut τ=2: -23 <=0, yes; τ=3:1>0, so <=0 only for τ<=2.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 +24τ => 24τ >=48 => τ >=2.\n\nSo at τ=2, both true: low = -71+48= -23 <=0, high= -48+48=0 <=0? 0 <=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=2, high = -48 + 24*2 = -48+48=0, so 0 <=0, yes.\n\nAt τ=1: low = -71+24= -47, high= -48+24= -24, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=3: low = -71+72=1, high= -48+72=24, 1 to 24, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2 for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars.\n\nCar1: span [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ]\n\n0 in this? 37+4τ <=0? 37+4τ is always positive since τ>=0, min at τ=0 is 37>0, so 0 not in [37+4τ,48+4τ] for any τ.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [1 + 4τ, 12 + 4τ]\n\n0 in this if 1+4τ <=0 <=12+4τ\n\n1+4τ <=0? 4τ <= -1, impossible since τ>=0, so never.\n\nCar3: [-35 + 4τ, -24 + 4τ]\n\n0 in this if -35 +4τ <=0 <= -24 +4τ\n\nFirst: -35 +4τ <=0 => 4τ <=35 => τ <= 35/4 = 8.75, so τ <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +4τ => 4τ >=24 => τ >=6\n\nSo for τ=6,7,8\n\nAt τ=6: low = -35+24= -11? 4*6=24, -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=7: low= -35+28= -7, high= -24+28=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=8: low= -35+32= -3, high= -24+32=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=5: low= -35+20= -15, high= -24+20= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=9: low= -35+36=1, high= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 7, dangerous when car3 covers 0, at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as freeway 7.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 both have the same cars, so same dangerous times.\n\nSummarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- Freeway 3: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- Freeway 4: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- Freeway 5: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at τ=6,7,8\n\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at τ=6,7,8\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ=H.\n\ny can be 0 to 9.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=1 to 8 at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor freeways 1-6, dangerous only at τ=2. So we should not be on any of y=1,2,3,4,5,6 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 to 6 correspond to freeways 1 to 6.\n\nFreeway k is on row y=k.\n\nSo at τ=2, we should not be on y=1,2,3,4,5, or 6.\n\nThat is, at time τ=2, player should be at y=0,7,8, or 9.\n\ny=0,7,8,9 are safe at τ=2, since y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, and y=7 and 8 are freeways but not dangerous at τ=2, since dangerous only later.\n\nAt τ=2, freeway 7 and 8 are not dangerous, only at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 7 and 8, dangerous at τ=6,7,8, so we should not be on y=7 or 8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\ny=7 and 8 should be avoided at times τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, player at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: since from 0 to 9, 9 steps up would take to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut we have constraints.\n\nFirst, at τ=2, we need to be not on y=1 to 6.\n\nSo at τ=2, y_2 must be in {0,7,8,9}.\n\nBut at τ=0, y=0.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y clipped to [0,9].\n\nAt τ=0, we can choose a_0: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, at τ=1, y=1\n\nIf S, y=0\n\nIf D, y=0, since min 0.\n\nSimilarly, from y=1, etc.\n\nNow, at τ=2, we need y_2 in {0,7,8,9}.\n\nBut from τ=0, after two actions, at τ=2.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nStart y_0=0\n\nAfter a_0 and a_1, y_2.\n\ny_2 depends on a_0 and a_1.\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nThen if a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=1\n\nIf a_1=D, y_2=0\n\nSimilarly, if a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen if a_1=S, y_2=1\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nIf a_1=D, y_2=0\n\nIf a_0=D, y_1=0 (since y=0, D keeps at 0)\n\nThen same as a_0=S.\n\nSo from y_0=0, after two actions, y_2 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If both S or D, y_2=0\n\n- If first U, then S or D: y_2=1 (since U to y=1, then S or D stays at 1, D to 0? y_1=1, if a_1=D, y_2=0; if a_1=S, y_2=1; if a_1=U, y_2=2)\n\nCases:\n\n- a_0=S or D: y_1=0\n\nThen a_1=S or D: y_2=0\n\na_1=U: y_2=1\n\n- a_0=U: y_1=1\n\nThen a_1=S: y_2=1\n\na_1=D: y_2=0\n\na_1=U: y_2=2\n\nSo possible y_2: 0,1,2\n\nBut we need y_2 in {0,7,8,9}\n\nBut 7,8,9 are impossible to reach in two steps from 0, since max increase is 2, to y=2.\n\nSo only possible y_2=0 is in the set.\n\ny_2 must be 0.\n\nBecause 1 and 2 are not in {0,7,8,9}, and 7,8,9 unreachable.\n\nSo at τ=2, we must be at y=0.\n\nTherefore, we cannot move up in the first two turns; we must stay or move down, but since at y=0, down does nothing, so essentially, for τ=0 and τ=1, we must choose actions that keep us at y=0.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=0, we must choose S or D, so y_1=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, we must choose S or D, so y_2=0.\n\nSo we stay at y=0 for the first two turns.\n\nNow, after that, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAlso, we have constraints at τ=6,7,8 for y=7 and 8.\n\nDangerous at τ=6,7,8 for freeway 7 and 8, so we should not be on y=7 or 8 at times τ=6,7,8.\n\nThat means, at τ=6, y_6 should not be 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly at τ=7, y_7 not 7 or 8.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8 not 7 or 8.\n\nNow, y=7 and 8 are only dangerous at those times, but other times are ok, as long as no car at 0.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, only dangerous at τ=6,7,8, so at other times, it is safe to be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, only dangerous at τ=2, which we already handled.\n\nFreeways 1-6 only at τ=2 dangerous, and we are not on them at that time.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: from τ=2, y=0, to y=9, need at least 7 moves up, so at least 7 actions, arriving at y=9 at τ=9 or later.\n\nBut we have constraints at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSet τ=2 as new starting point, but time is absolute.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe time from τ=2 to some τ=H.\n\nAfter H-2 actions from τ=2? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, at time τ=2+k, y_{2+k}\n\nWe want y_{2+k} =9 for some k.\n\nk min is 7, if we move up each time, at τ=9, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nBut we need to check the path for collisions at times between τ=2 and τ=9.\n\nSpecifically, when we are on y=1 to 8, need to ensure that at that time, no car on that row has 0 in span.\n\nNow, for freeways 1-6, since dangerous only at τ=2, and at τ=2 we are at y=0, not on them, and for τ>2, are they safe?\n\nFor example, freeway 1: dangerous only at τ=2, so for τ≠2, it is safe to be on y=1, since no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIs that true?\n\nFor freeway 1, at τ=2, car at span including 0.\n\nAt other times, not, so for τ≠2, if we are on y=1, no collision.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4,5,6, all only dangerous at τ=2, so for τ≠2, safe to be on them.\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8: dangerous at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo for τ≠6,7,8, safe to be on y=7 or 8.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, freeway 7: car3 span [-35+20, -24+20] = [-15,-4], not include 0, and other cars not, so safe.\n\nτ=9: car3 [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at τ=2 to y=9 at some τ.\n\nMinimal time: if we go up every step, from τ=2 to τ=9, y from 0 to 7 in 7 steps? Let's see times.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0\n\nAfter action a_2 at time τ=2 (which is t= t1 +2, but relative τ)\n\nAt time τ, after action at τ, position at τ+1? No.\n\nRecall: at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, it affects y_{τ+1}.\n\nSo at time τ=2, we are at y_2=0.\n\nWe apply action a_2, then at time τ=3, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo to reach y=9, we need y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=2, if we move up each step:\n\na_2=U: y_3=1\n\na_3=U: y_4=2\n\na_4=U: y_5=3\n\na_5=U: y_6=4\n\na_6=U: y_7=5\n\na_7=U: y_8=6\n\na_8=U: y_9=7\n\na_9=U: y_10=8\n\na_10=U: y_11=9\n\nThis takes 9 actions from τ=2, arriving at y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut we can move faster.\n\nFrom y=0, to y=9, min 9 moves up.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0.\n\nAfter first up, at τ=3, y=1\n\nAfter second, τ=4, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k up moves, at τ=2+k, y=k\n\nSo to have y=9, need k=9, so at τ=2+9=11, y=9.\n\nWe can arrive earlier if we start from higher, but we start from y=0 at τ=2.\n\nIf we move up faster, but each move takes one turn.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y earlier by moving up multiple times, but each up increases y by one per turn, so min 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, delta 9, each U increases by 1, so min 9 U actions, taking 9 turns, arriving at τ=11 if start at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=11, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to check if during the path, we are safe.\n\nIn the above sequence:\n\nAt τ=3, y=1, on freeway 1.\n\nAt τ=3, is freeway 1 dangerous? Freeway 1 dangerous only at τ=2, not at τ=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=4, y=2, freeway 2, dangerous only τ=2, safe.\n\nτ=5, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nτ=6, y=4, freeway 4, dangerous only τ=2, safe.\n\nτ=7, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nτ=8, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nNow τ=9, y=7, on freeway 7.\n\nAt τ=9, is freeway 7 dangerous? Dangerous at τ=6,7,8, not at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, car3: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt τ=10, car3: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16], not include 0, safe.\n\nThen τ=11, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we have constraints at τ=6,7,8 to avoid y=7 and 8.\n\nIn this path, at τ=6, y=4, not 7 or 8.\n\nτ=7, y=5, not 7 or 8.\n\nτ=8, y=6, not 7 or 8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnd we reach at τ=11.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up faster, but we can't, min 9 steps.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 earlier by starting from higher, but at τ=2 we are at y=0.\n\nMaybe we can reach before τ=11.\n\nNo, from y=0 at τ=2 to y=9, min time is τ=11.\n\nBut we need to avoid the dangerous times for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn this case, we are not on y=7 or 8 at τ=6,7,8, since we are lower.\n\nBut we could be on y=7 or 8 at other times.\n\nBut in this path, we are on y=7 at τ=9, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at τ=10, safe.\n\nNow, but we have to output the actions from t_1, which is τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0 and τ=1, we must stay at y=0, so actions S or D.\n\nThen from τ=2 to τ=10, move up each time.\n\nActions:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t1=26): action a_{t1} , which is for time t1, but in the sequence.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t1.\n\nTurn t1: action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}\n\nIn terms of τ: at time τ, action a_τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nAt τ=0, action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAt τ=1, action a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\netc.\n\nIn this case, to stay at y=0 for τ=0 and τ=1:\n\nAt τ=0: since y_0=0, to have y_1=0, we need Δy_0=0, so a_0 = S (or D, but D would try to go down, but y=0, so y_1=0 still, but action D is possible, but it has same effect as S at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, to have y_2=0, a_1 = S or D.\n\nThen at τ=2, a_2=U, so y_3=1\n\nτ=3, a_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\nup to τ=10, a_10=U, y_11=9\n\ny_11=9 at τ=11.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to t=H-1 actions, position at t=H.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, position y_H.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at time τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, with 11 actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, actions, then at τ=11, y_11=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_10.\n\na_0: S or D, to stay at y=1=0? y_1=0.\n\nSimilarly a_1: S or D, y_2=0.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nNow, at τ=9, y=7, which is freeway 7, but at τ=9, not dangerous, safe.\n\nτ=10, y=8, freeway 8, at τ=10, not dangerous, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), which is at τ=11.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at τ=2, but we must be at y=0 at τ=2, so no.\n\nPerhaps we can move up earlier, but we cannot because at τ=2 we must be at y=0.\n\nAnother idea: after τ=2, we don't have to move up every time; we can stay or move down to avoid something, but in this case, there is no need, since the only constraints are at τ=6,7,8 for y=7,8, but in this path we are not on them.\n\nBut at τ=6,7,8, we are at y=4,5,6, which are freeways 4,5,6, but not dangerous at those times.\n\nFor example, τ=6, y=4, freeway 4: at τ=6, span: for freeway 4, initial [-71,-48] at τ=0, at τ=6, [-71 + 24*6, -48 + 24*6] = [-71 + 144, -48 + 144] = [73, 96], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut H=11, from τ=0 to τ=10 actions, 11 turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we start moving up immediately, but we cannot because we must stay at τ=2.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=0, we are at y=0, not freeway.\n\nWe need to be not on y=1-6 at τ=2.\n\nBut we could be on y=7,8,9 at τ=2, but impossible since from y=0, in two steps, max y=2.\n\nSo only y=0 possible.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=6, freeway 7: car3 span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]? 4*6=24, -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 included, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly τ=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nIn our path, at τ=6, y=4, not 7.\n\nBut suppose we want to go faster, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before τ=11.\n\nFor example, if at some point we are higher, but no.\n\nMinimal time is fixed.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=8, y=6, which is freeway 6, at τ=8.\n\nFreeway 6: at τ=8, span: initial [-71,-48] at τ=0, s=24, at τ=8, [-71 + 24*8, -48 + 24*8] = [-71 + 192, -48 + 192] = [121, 144], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 7 and 8, but we are not on them at τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, another constraint: at τ=6,7,8, we should not be on y=7 or 8, which we are not.\n\nBut we could be on other rows.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we are moving up steadily.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=7, which is safe, as [1,12] not include 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but the player might choose to stay or move down at some point, but no need, since no danger.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in less than 11 turns.\n\nFor example, if we start moving up at τ=0.\n\nBut if a_0=U, then at τ=1, y=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 1: span [-83 +36*1, -48 +36*1] = [-47, -12], not include 0, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can choose action.\n\nNow at τ=2, we need y_2 not on 1-6.\n\nBut if at τ=1, y=1, and we do a_1, if a_1=S, y_2=1, which is bad, since at τ=2, y=1 is dangerous.\n\nIf a_1=D, y_2=0, which is ok.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=2, which is dangerous at τ=2.\n\nSo if we move up at τ=0, then at τ=1 we must move down to be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nBut moving down from y=1 to y=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, same as before.\n\nThen we proceed up.\n\nBut now, from τ=0 to τ=2: a_0=U, y_1=1; then a_1=D, y_2=0.\n\nThen same as before, but we have an extra move: U then D, but y still 0 at τ=2, but we used two actions to stay, same as S S.\n\nBut in terms of time, we still need to go to y=9 from there.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0, same as if we did S at τ=0 and S at τ=1.\n\nBut with a_0=U and a_1=D, we end up at same place, but we moved and came back, which takes same time but unnecessary actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we should not do that; better to stay.\n\nSimilarly, if we do nothing.\n\nSo minimal actions: stay for first two turns, then up for nine turns.\n\nTotal 11 actions: two S (or D) and nine U.\n\nThen at τ=11, y=9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: from τ=0 to τ=10.\n\nFor the answer, we need to list actions for turns starting from t1=26.\n\nTurn t1: a_{26} for time t1, which affects position at t1+1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence: for turn t=26,27,28,... up to t=26+10=36? Let's see.\n\nt1=26.\n\nAt turn t1=26: action a_{26}, which is applied at time t1, so after a_{26}, position at time t1+1=27.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn terms of τ: τ=0 at t=26.\n\na_τ for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time τ=H, position.\n\nWe want position at time τ=H to be (0,9).\n\nWith H=11, at τ=11.\n\nτ=11 corresponds to absolute time t=26+11=37.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=10, i.e., turns t=26 to t=36.\n\nt=26 to t=36 is 11 turns? t=26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36: that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter last action at t=36, position at t=37.\n\nAt t=37, y=9.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nFor the first two, we can choose S or D, but since D at y=0 does nothing, same as S. Probably S is fine.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be faster.\n\nSuppose we go to y=9 in fewer steps, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps avoid the constraints by being at y=7 or 8 before or after the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, we could stay at some point to let the cars pass, but in this case, since we are not on y=7 or 8 during τ=6,7,8, it's fine.\n\nSuppose we want to be at y=9 earlier, but we can't because of the initial constraint.\n\nAnother idea: after τ=2, we move up, but at some point we stay to be at y=7 or 8 after τ=8.\n\nBut in the direct path, we are at y=7 at τ=9>8, which is fine.\n\nIf we go faster, we might be at y=7 earlier, but we cannot go faster than one per turn.\n\nFor example, if at τ=2, y=0, we move up to y=1 at τ=3, etc., as before.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, as above.\n\nIf we move up twice at some point, but we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 7 and 8 dangerous at τ=6,7,8, but we are not on them.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=7 at τ=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=7, freeway 7, and at τ=9, as computed, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7, there are three cars, but only car3 matters, and at τ=9, [1,12], not 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but let's list the actions.\n\nActions:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 26): a_0 = S (stay)\n\nAt τ=1 (turn 27): a_1 = S (stay)\n\nAt τ=2 (turn 28): a_2 = U (up)\n\nAt τ=3 (turn 29): a_3 = U\n\nAt τ=4 (turn 30): a_4 = U\n\nAt τ=5 (turn 31): a_5 = U\n\nAt τ=6 (turn 32): a_6 = U\n\nAt τ=7 (turn 33): a_7 = U\n\nAt τ=8 (turn 34): a_8 = U\n\nAt τ=9 (turn 35): a_9 = U\n\nAt τ=10 (turn 36): a_10 = U\n\nThen at τ=11 (turn 37), y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after a_10 at turn 36, position at turn 37 is (0,9).\n\nNow, H=11 turns? From turn 26 to turn 36, 11 actions.\n\nTurns: turn t for t=26 to 36 inclusive, that's 11 turns.\n\nAction at each turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1\n\nt_1 =26\n\nH=11, so actions from turn 26 to turn 26 + 10 =36? t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H.\n\nWe start at time t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action at t_1, position at t_1+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, position at t_1 + H.\n\nWe want position at t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nSo actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=26, H=11, so actions for turns 26 to 26+10=36.\n\nThen position at t=37 is (0,9).\n\nNow, in the sequence above, with a_0 to a_10 for τ=0 to 10.\n\nBut τ=0 is t=26, etc.\n\nNow, for the first two, I have S, but we could use D, but S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the action, for τ=0 and τ=1, we need to stay, so S.\n\nThen U for the next nine.\n\nIn the sequence, from τ=2 to τ=10, that's 9 actions? τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: that's 9 actions, but we need to go from y=0 to y=9, which takes 9 U actions.\n\nFrom τ=2, y=0, after a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nAfter a_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_10=U, y_11=9\n\na_2 to a_10 is 9 actions: τ=2 to τ=10, 9 actions.\n\nBut τ=10 is the 9th action? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_τ for τ from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\na_0: at τ=0, to set y_1\n\na_1: at τ=1, to set y_2\n\n...\n\na_10: at τ=10, to set y_11\n\nYes.\n\nIn terms of turns: turn 26: a_{26} = S (since τ=0)\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = S (τ=1)\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = U (τ=2)\n\nTurn 29: a_{29} = U (τ=3)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 36: a_{36} = U (τ=10)\n\nThen at turn 37, position (0,9)\n\nNow, but we need to reach (0,9), and H=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we don't stay the first two turns, but we must, to avoid collision at τ=2.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=1 is safe, as freeway 1 at τ=1: [-47,-12] not 0.\n\nThen at τ=2, we need to not be on y=1-6.\n\nIf we are at y=1 at τ=1, we can go down to y=0 at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, same as before.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut now, we have actions: at τ=0: U, then τ=1: D, then τ=2: U, etc.\n\nCompared to S,S,U,... we have the same number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, with U then D: at τ=0: U, y_1=1; τ=1: D, y_2=0; then from y=0 at τ=2, same as before, need 9 U to reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut we used U and D for first two, then 9 U, total 11 actions same.\n\nBut we moved unnecessarily, so S S is better, but same H.\n\nSimilarly, if we do nothing.\n\nSo no shorter.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in less than 9 up moves, but impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, about the dangerous times for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn our path, we are at y=6 at τ=8, then y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nAt τ=6,7,8, we are at y=4,5,6, not 7 or 8.\n\nAt τ=6: y=4 (if we start from τ=2 y=0, up each)\n\nτ=6: y=4\n\nτ=7: y=5\n\nτ=8: y=6\n\nAll not 7 or 8.\n\nIf we were to be on y=7 or 8 at other times, it would be fine, but we don't need to.\n\nNow, but in freeway 7 and 8, only dangerous at τ=6,7,8, so at τ=9, y=7 is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think that's the plan.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nSo for turn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nThen after turn 36 action, at turn 37, position (0,9)\n\nIn the sequence, turn 36 is the last action.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\n}\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nt_1=26\n\nActions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = 26 to 26+10=36, yes.\n\nH=11.\n\nMinimal number is 11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose we reach at τ=10, y=10, but y=10 is invalid, max y=9.\n\ny=9 at τ=10.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=0, to y=9 at τ=10.\n\nAfter 10 actions? At τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at τ=10, y_10.\n\nTo have y_10=9, need net +9 in 10 actions, so possible with 9 U and 1 S, for example.\n\nBut we have constraints.\n\nAt τ=2, we need y_2 not in 1-6.\n\nIf we use actions to move up most of the time.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=0: U, y_1=1\n\nBut at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1: we need to set y_2.\n\nIf we do S, y_2=1, but at τ=2, y=1 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf D, y_2=0, safe.\n\nIf U, y_2=2, dangerous at τ=2.\n\nSo must do D at τ=1, so y_2=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0.\n\nNow from there, to have y_10=9.\n\ny at τ=2 is 0.\n\nAfter actions from τ=2 to τ=9, 8 actions, to set y_10.\n\ny_10 = y_2 + sum_{i=2 to 9} Δy_i\n\ny_2=0, y_10=9, so sum Δy from i=2 to 9 must be +9.\n\nThere are 8 actions: a_2 to a_9, which affect y_3 to y_10.\n\na_2 at τ=2 affects y_3\n\n...\n\na_9 at τ=9 affects y_10\n\nSo with 8 actions, we need y_10 =9, so the sum of Δy from a_2 to a_9 must be +9.\n\nBut each Δy <=1, so max y_10 = y_2 +8 = 0+8=8 <9, impossible.\n\ny_2=0, after 8 actions (a_2 to a_9), we get y_3 to y_10, so y_10 <= y_2 + 8 = 8 <9, cannot reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nIf we start from τ=0.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=H, from y=0 at τ=0, we need at least 9 up moves, so H >=9, but with the constraint at τ=2 forcing us to be at y=0, which requires two stays or equivalent, so H=11 is minimal.\n\nWithout constraint, min H=9, with actions from τ=0 to 8, y_9=9.\n\nBut at τ=2, if we are not at y=0, we have collision.\n\nFor example, if we go up directly: a_0=U, y_1=1; a_1=U, y_2=2; but at τ=2, y=2, which is freeway 2, and dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if a_0=S, y_1=0; a_1=U, y_2=1; at τ=2, y=1, dangerous.\n\nOnly if a_0=S or D, y_1=0; then a_1=S or D, y_2=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 9 actions, total 11.\n\nThus, H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the output, for the actions, we can choose S or D for the first two, but S is simpler.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at τ=6,7,8 dangerous, but we avoid being on them.\n\nIn the sequence, all good.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 26\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions must ensure that:\n- At turn \\(T = t_1 + 2 = 28\\) (relative time \\(\\tau = 2\\)), the player is not on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) because cars on these freeways cover \\(x = 0\\) at this time, causing a collision.\n- At turns \\(T = t_1 + 6 = 32\\), \\(T = t_1 + 7 = 33\\), and \\(T = t_1 + 8 = 34\\) (relative times \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\)), the player is not on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) because cars on these freeways cover \\(x = 0\\) at these times.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 26), the player is at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe.\n- To avoid being on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 28), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at this time, as \\(y = 7, 8, 9\\) are unreachable in 2 steps from \\(y = 0\\). This requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two actions (turns 26 and 27) using the \"S\" (stay) action.\n- From \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 28) onwards, moving up (\"U\") every turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at \\(\\tau = 11\\) (turn 37) without being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\) (since the player is at \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) respectively) and avoids all other collisions, as no freeways are dangerous at other times.\n\nThe action sequence for turns 26 to 36 (11 actions) is:\n- Turns 26 and 27: \"S\" to stay at \\(y = 0\\) and avoid the collision at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- Turns 28 to 36: \"U\" to move up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 37.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 11\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: S \\\\\nTurn 27: S \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 28, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeway we are on at the same turn.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of the car at turn T.\n\nAlso note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} (by U or D) at turn T, at turn T we are still on y_T. So we only check the car on the current freeway (if we are on freeway y_T) at turn T.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 28. We need to get to (0,9). We can only move vertically (y-direction) with actions U (+1), D (-1), S (0). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8. So when we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe from cars. However, the goal is (0,9), so we must end at y=9.\n\nWe have to avoid collisions when we are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nGiven car states at turn t1=28:\n\nFor each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have one or more cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For left-moving: the car moves left, and the span at time t is [h(t), τ(t)] and it moves as h(t) = h0 - s*(t-t0) and τ(t) = τ0 - s*(t-t0). But note the initial head and tail: in the table, for left-moving we don't have any? Actually, all cars in the given state are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nThe direction is given as \"right\". So all cars are right-moving.\n\nFor a right-moving car, the car moves to the right. The initial representation at t0=28 is:\n\n- The car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed). Since it's right-moving, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the problem states:\n\nFor right-moving: the initial span at t1 is [τ, h] (so tail at τ and head at h, meaning τ <= h). Then at time T, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nWait: head = -48, tail = -83? That would imply that at t1=28, the car is from -83 to -48? But that's a length of 35, and moving right at 36 per turn? That seems odd because the car would move 36 units per turn, which is more than the car length? But let's compute the span at time T.\n\nActually, the representation might be that the head is the front? So for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point. Then the tail is the leftmost. So at t1, the car is from τ to h, meaning from -83 to -48? That is a car of length 35? And it moves right at 36 per turn? Then at turn T, the car is from -83 + 36*(T-28) to -48 + 36*(T-28).\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nNow, we are at (0,0) at turn 28. We are at y=0, so no car collision at turn 28. Then we start moving.\n\nOur goal is to reach y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 9 moves upward. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions from turn 28 onward.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each future turn T (>=28) whether the car on that freeway will cover the x=0 at turn T. But note: each freeway may have multiple cars. So we have to check all cars on a freeway.\n\nLet me write a helper function to compute, for a given car (h, τ, d, s) and a time T (relative to t0=28), whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, we have:\n\n  span at T: [τ + s*(T-28), h + s*(T-28)]\n\nThen 0 is in the span if:\n\n  τ + s*(T-28) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-28)\n\nBut note: for freeway 1: τ = -83, h = -48, s=36.\n\nSo condition for freeway 1 at time T:\n\n  -83 + 36*(T-28) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-28)\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7 and 8, we have three cars each.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways we are going to step on. We start at y=0 (turn 28). Then at turn 29, we can be at y=0 (if S) or y=1 (if U). We cannot go down because y cannot be negative.\n\nOur plan: we must go up to y=9. We can consider going up as quickly as possible, but avoiding collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe can simulate turn by turn. Since the minimal moves is at least 9 (if we go up without stopping), but we might have to stop or even go down? But going down from y=0 is not allowed (we are at 0, so D would leave us at 0). So we can only go up or stay.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait at a safe spot (like at y=0 or y=9) to avoid a car. Since we start at y=0, we can wait there as long as we want? But our goal is to minimize turns, so we don't want to wait unnecessarily.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at a freeway that is safe? But we cannot stay on a freeway if there is a car at x=0 at that turn. So we must avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nWe can also note that the cars are moving and the pattern repeats? Actually, the cars move linearly, so we can compute the times when a freeway is blocked (i.e., there is a car at x=0).\n\nFor each freeway k, we can compute the set of turns T (>=28) at which the freeway k is blocked (meaning there exists at least one car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at turn T).\n\nWe can then simulate the player's movement and check for each freeway we step on at a given turn, whether that freeway is blocked at that turn.\n\nLet me compute the blocking times for each freeway.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nCondition: -83 + 36*(T-28) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-28)\n\nSolve:\n\nLower bound: -83 + 36*(T-28) <= 0  => 36*(T-28) <= 83 => T-28 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T <= 30.305, so T <= 30 (since T integer)\n\nUpper bound: 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-28) => 36*(T-28) >= 48 => T-28 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 => T >= 29.333, so T>=30\n\nThus, T must be integer such that T>=30 and T<=30? Because T>=30 from upper bound and T<=30 from lower bound? Actually:\n\nFrom upper bound: T-28 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => T>= 28 + 4/3 = 29.333, so T>=30 (since T integer)\n\nFrom lower bound: T-28 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T<= 28+2.305 = 30.305, so T<=30.\n\nSo T=30.\n\nThus, freeway 1 is blocked only at turn 30.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> same calculation: blocked at turn 30.\n\nFreeway 3: same -> blocked at turn 30.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nCondition: -71 + 24*(T-28) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-28)\n\nLower: -71 + 24*(T-28) <= 0 => 24*(T-28) <= 71 => T-28 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 => T<=30.958, so T<=30\n\nUpper: 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-28) => 24*(T-28) >=48 => T-28>=2 => T>=30.\n\nSo T=30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 and 6: same as 4 -> blocked at turn 30.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 4) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? Then at T: [37+4*(T-28), 48+4*(T-28)]\n\nCondition: 37+4*(T-28) <= 0 <= 48+4*(T-28)\n\nBut 37+4*(T-28) is at least 37 at T=28, and increases. So 37+4*(T-28) >=37>0, so the lower bound is always above 0? Then 0 is never in [37+4*(T-28), 48+4*(T-28)] because the entire span is above 0? So this car never blocks.\n\nSecond car: (12, 1, right, 4) -> [1+4*(T-28), 12+4*(T-28)]\n\nCondition: 1+4*(T-28) <= 0 <= 12+4*(T-28)\n\nBut 1+4*(T-28) is at least 1 at T=28, and increases. So always above 0? So never blocks.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 4) -> [-35+4*(T-28), -24+4*(T-28)]\n\nCondition: -35+4*(T-28) <= 0 <= -24+4*(T-28)\n\nLower: -35+4*(T-28) <=0 => 4*(T-28)<=35 => T-28<=35/4=8.75 => T<=36.75 -> T<=36\n\nUpper: 0<=-24+4*(T-28) => 4*(T-28)>=24 => T-28>=6 => T>=34\n\nSo T must be between 34 and 36 inclusive? Let me check:\n\nAt T=34: \n  lower: -35+4*(6) = -35+24 = -11 <=0\n  upper: -24+24 = 0 <=0 -> yes, 0 is included (at the boundary).\n\nAt T=35: \n  lower: -35+4*7 = -35+28 = -7 <=0\n  upper: -24+28=4>=0 -> yes.\n\nAt T=36:\n  lower: -35+4*8 = -35+32=-3<=0\n  upper: -24+32=8>=0 -> yes.\n\nAt T=37: \n  lower: -35+4*9=-35+36=1>0 -> no.\n\nSo freeway 7 is blocked at turns 34,35,36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same three cars? The table says the same as freeway 7. So freeway 8 is also blocked at turns 34,35,36.\n\nSummary of blocking:\n\nFreeway 1: turn 30\nFreeway 2: turn 30\nFreeway 3: turn 30\nFreeway 4: turn 30\nFreeway 5: turn 30\nFreeway 6: turn 30\nFreeway 7: turns 34,35,36\nFreeway 8: turns 34,35,36\n\nNow, we start at turn 28 at y=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. We must pass through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway at the turn when that freeway is blocked.\n\nWe can simulate the path. We need the minimal H (number of turns) such that we end at y=9 at the last action.\n\nWe are going to use BFS or dynamic programming? But the state is (turn, y) and we want minimal turns.\n\nAlternatively, since the blocking is only at specific turns, we can plan the moves.\n\nWe must be careful: we are at y=0 at turn 28.\n\nWe can only move up (U) or stay (S). We cannot go down from 0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal without stopping is 9 moves: 9 U's, then we would be at y=9 at turn 37.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nTurn 28: at y=0 (safe)\n\nAction at turn 28: U -> turn 29: y=1\n\nBut freeway 1 is blocked at turn 30? At turn 29, we are at y=1. Is freeway 1 blocked at turn 29? No, only at turn 30. So safe.\n\nTurn 29: action U -> turn 30: y=2\n\nNow at turn 30, we are on freeway 2. Freeway 2 is blocked at turn 30! So we collide.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway 2 at turn 30. Similarly, we cannot be at any freeway 1 to 6 at turn 30? Actually, freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all blocked at turn 30.\n\nSo if we are on any of these freeways at turn 30, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 1-6 at turn 30.\n\nWe have a few options:\n\nOption 1: at turn 30, be at y=0 or y=9 or above? But we are at y=0 at turn 28. If we do:\n\nTurn 28: S (stay) -> then at turn 29, we are still at y=0.\n\nThen at turn 29: we can do U -> then at turn 30, we are at y=1. But freeway 1 is blocked at turn 30 -> collide.\n\nIf we do two S's: \nTurn 28: S -> turn 29: y=0\nTurn 29: S -> turn 30: y=0 (safe, because not on freeway)\n\nThen at turn 30: we can start moving.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9. How?\n\nAfter turn 30, we can move up.\n\nBut note: freeways 7 and 8 are blocked at turns 34,35,36. So we must avoid being on freeway 7 or 8 at turns 34,35,36.\n\nWe are at turn 30: at y=0.\n\nWe can start moving up:\n\nTurn 30: U -> turn 31: y=1\nTurn 31: U -> turn 32: y=2\nTurn 32: U -> turn 33: y=3\nTurn 33: U -> turn 34: y=4\n\nAt turn 34, we are on freeway 4? But freeway 4 is not blocked at turn 34? It was only blocked at turn 30. So safe.\n\nBut then:\n\nTurn 34: U -> turn 35: y=5\nTurn 35: U -> turn 36: y=6\n\nAt turn 35, we are on freeway 5? Freeway 5 is safe at turn 35 (only blocked at 30). At turn 36: y=6 (freeway 6) -> safe.\n\nBut then:\n\nTurn 36: U -> turn 37: y=7 -> now freeway 7 is blocked at turn 37? Wait, freeway 7 is blocked at 34,35,36. At turn 37, it is not blocked? So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn 37, we are at freeway 7? The blocking for freeway 7 was at 34,35,36. Turn 37 is clear. So safe.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 37: U -> turn 38: y=8 -> freeway 8? At turn 38: freeway 8 is blocked at 34,35,36, so turn 38 is safe.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 38: U -> turn 39: y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from turn 28 to turn 39? That is 12 turns? But the actions are from turn 28 to turn 38? 11 actions? Let me count:\n\nWe did:\n\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n\nThat's 11 actions. Then at the end of turn 38, we are at y=9.\n\nBut is that minimal? We started at turn 28 at y=0, and we ended at turn 38 (after 11 actions) at y=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t1+H-1}=9. So H is the number of actions, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe started at turn t1=28. We have H actions: from a_28 to a_{28+H-1}. Then after the last action, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\n- After a_28 (S): turn 29, y=0\n- After a_29 (S): turn 30, y=0\n- After a_30 (U): turn 31, y=1\n- ...\n- After a_38 (U): turn 39, y=9\n\nSo we have H=11 actions? From t=28 to t=38. Then the turn after the last action is 39, and we are at y=9.\n\nBut we can do better? We avoided the turn 30 by waiting two turns. But we had to wait because if we move up on turn 28 and 29, we hit freeway 1 or 2 at turn 30.\n\nWhat if we only wait one turn? Then:\n\nTurn 28: S -> turn 29: y=0\nTurn 29: U -> turn 30: y=1 -> but freeway 1 blocked at turn 30 -> collide.\n\nSo we must wait two turns? Then we are at y=0 at turn 30.\n\nBut then we proceed without stopping until y=9? However, we have to check freeways 7 and 8 at turns 34,35,36.\n\nIn our plan, we are at:\n\nTurn 30: y=0 -> safe\nTurn 31: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 only blocked at 30)\nTurn 32: y=2 -> safe\nTurn 33: y=3 -> safe\nTurn 34: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 only blocked at 30)\nTurn 35: y=5 -> safe\nTurn 36: y=6 -> safe\nTurn 37: y=7 -> freeway7: blocked at 34,35,36 -> 37 is safe\nTurn 38: y=8 -> freeway8: blocked at 34,35,36 -> 38 is safe\nTurn 39: y=9 -> goal\n\nBut note: at turn 37, we are at freeway7 at turn 37? And freeway7 is not blocked at 37? Correct.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 earlier?\n\nWe started at turn 28. We waited two turns, then 9 moves up: total 11 turns.\n\nBut what if we try to skip the waiting by going faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at a higher freeway? For example, if we can get above freeway 6 by turn 30, then we avoid the block at turn 30. But from turn 28 to turn 30, we have two moves: we can get to y=2 at turn 30. But freeway 2 is blocked at turn 30 -> collide.\n\nIf we try to get to y=3 at turn 30? That would require:\n\nTurn 28: U -> y=1 at turn 29\nTurn 29: U -> y=2 at turn 30 -> collide (freeway2 blocked)\nTurn 28: U, then turn 29: U -> same.\n\nWe cannot get to y=3 at turn 30 because we start at y=0 and only two moves.\n\nSo we must be below freeway1 or above freeway6 at turn 30? But above freeway6 is y>=7? We can't get to y=7 in two moves from y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn 30.\n\nBut then we have to climb from y=0 to y=9, which takes 9 moves. So total 11 moves.\n\nBut wait: we have to avoid the blocks at freeways 7 and 8 at turns 34,35,36.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y=7 at turn 37, which is safe. But what if we try to go faster? We are going at one per turn. So we cannot skip any.\n\nBut note: we could potentially wait at a safe freeway? For example, if we get to freeway 7 at a safe turn? But freeway 7 is blocked at 34,35,36. So we must avoid being on freeway7 at those turns.\n\nIn our plan, we are at freeway7 at turn 37 (safe) and freeway8 at turn 38 (safe). \n\nBut what if we get to freeway7 earlier? Then we might be blocked.\n\nFor example, if we don't wait at the beginning, we collide at turn30. So we have to wait.\n\nBut after turn30, we are moving up as fast as possible.\n\nWe could potentially wait at a freeway that is not blocked? For example, if we get to freeway 3 at a safe time? But after turn30, freeways 1-6 are safe? Because they are only blocked at turn30.\n\nSo we don't need to wait in between.\n\nBut we have to pass freeway7 and 8 at safe times.\n\nWe are passing freeway7 at turn37 and freeway8 at turn38. Is there a way to pass freeway7 earlier? Then we would hit the block.\n\nFor instance, if we want to be at freeway7 at turn34: that would require being at y=7 at turn34.\n\nWe start at turn30: y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=7 at turn34: that is 4 moves? But we have 4 moves: from turn30 to turn34? \n\nTurn30: U -> turn31: y=1\nTurn31: U -> turn32: y=2\nTurn32: U -> turn33: y=3\nTurn33: U -> turn34: y=4 -> not 7.\n\nTo get to y=7 at turn34, we need 7 moves from turn30? But we have only 4 actions (turn30,31,32,33) -> we can get to y=4 at turn34.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=7 at turn34.\n\nSimilarly, if we try to be at freeway7 at turn35: we need to be at y=7 at turn35.\n\nWe start at turn30: y=0.\n\nWe have 5 actions: turn30,31,32,33,34 -> we can get to y=5 at turn35? (if we do 5 U's: y=5 at turn35).\n\nBut we need y=7 at turn35? Not possible.\n\nSimilarly, at turn36: we can get to y=6 at turn36 (if we do 6 U's from turn30 to turn35, then at turn36 we are at y=6? Actually, after 6 actions: from turn30 to turn35: 6 actions -> y=6 at turn36.\n\nBut we need to be at y=7 at turn36? Then we would need 7 U's, which would take until turn37: at turn37 we are at y=7.\n\nSo we cannot avoid passing freeway7 at turn37? And freeway8 at turn38.\n\nBut note: we could potentially wait somewhere to avoid the blocks? But freeway7 and 8 are blocked at 34,35,36. So if we are at freeway7 at turn37, it's safe.\n\nBut what if we get to freeway7 earlier and then wait? For example, if we get to freeway7 at turn33? Then we are at y=7 at turn33. Then we can wait at y=7 until the block is over? But freeway7 is blocked at turns34,35,36. So we must avoid being at y=7 at turns34,35,36.\n\nSo we could:\n\n- Get to y=7 at turn33: safe? Because freeway7 at turn33: is it blocked? We computed freeway7 blocked at 34,35,36. So turn33 is safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=7 at turn33?\n\nWe start at turn30: y=0.\n\nWe have 3 actions: turn30,31,32 -> we can get to y=3 at turn33? Not 7.\n\nWe cannot get to y=7 at turn33.\n\nAlternatively, we could get to y=7 at turn37, which is what we did.\n\nBut we could also get to y=7 at turn37 and then wait? But we don't need to wait because turn37 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway8: we are at y=8 at turn38, which is safe.\n\nSo our plan seems minimal: 11 actions.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 10? That would mean we end at turn37 (since 28+10-1=37) at y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid the blocks.\n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn30? Otherwise we collide. Then from turn30 to turn37: we have 7 actions. We need to go from y=0 to y=9: that requires 9 moves. 7 moves only get us to y=7 at turn37. Then we are at y=7 at turn37, which is freeway7, and safe. But we are not at y=9.\n\nSo we need two more moves: turn37: U -> y=8 at turn38, then turn38: U -> y=9 at turn39. So total 11 moves.\n\nWhat if we don't wait the full two turns at the beginning? We saw that one wait and then move up leads to collision at turn30.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up and then down? But from y=0, we can only go up. And we are at freeway1 at turn29: safe? Then at turn29, if we do D, we go back to y=0 at turn30. Then we avoid the collision? Because at turn30, we are at y=0 (safe).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn28: U -> turn29: y=1 (freeway1: safe at turn29)\nTurn29: D -> turn30: y=0 (safe)\n\nThen we have spent two moves and we are back at y=0. Then we still have to go up to y=9, which takes 9 moves. So total 11 moves? Same as before.\n\nBut we can combine: we are at y=0 at turn30. Then same as before.\n\nBut we have the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, note: in this case, we did U then D, which is the same as staying? Actually, we ended at the same place as if we did two S's. So same.\n\nBut we could potentially use this to avoid the blocks at the top? But we don't need to.\n\nIs there a way to get to y=9 in fewer than 11 moves? We must avoid turn30 on freeways1-6. We must be at y=0 at turn30. Then from there we need 9 moves to get to y=9. So 2 (wait) + 9 = 11. So minimal.\n\nBut what if we are at y=9 at turn30? That would require 9 moves from turn28? But we have only 2 moves: turn28 and 29. We can get to y=2 at turn30 -> collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have two sequences:\n\nSequence 1: \nTurn28: S\nTurn29: S\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: U\nTurn38: U\n\nSequence 2 (using down move, but same net effect? But we end at the same state):\n\nTurn28: U -> y=1 at turn29\nTurn29: D -> y=0 at turn30\nThen same as above from turn30: U, U, ... until U at turn38.\n\nBut sequence 1 is simpler: we stay twice and then go up.\n\nBut both have 11 moves.\n\nBut note: in sequence 2, we were at y=1 at turn29. And freeway1 at turn29: is it safe? We computed freeway1 blocked only at turn30, so yes.\n\nThen at turn29, we go down to y=0 at turn30: safe.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut is there any difference? We have to check the freeways we step on.\n\nIn sequence 2:\n\nTurn28: start at (0,0) -> move U: at turn29, we are at (0,1) -> freeway1 at turn29: not blocked (blocked only at 30) -> safe.\n\nTurn29: at (0,1) -> move D: at turn30, we are at (0,0) -> safe.\n\nThen same as sequence1 from turn30.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nBut we want minimal H? Both have H=11.\n\nBut we must output one.\n\nWe can choose the one that doesn't use D? Since S and U are sufficient.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require minimal actions of a particular type.\n\nBut note: we could also do:\n\nTurn28: S\nTurn29: U -> but then at turn30 we are at y=1 -> collide.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nSo we have to do either two S's or U then D.\n\nNow, we also have to avoid the blocks at freeways7 and 8. In both sequences, we are at:\n\nAt turn37: we are at y=7 -> freeway7 at turn37: safe? Yes.\n\nAt turn38: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn38: safe? Yes.\n\nThen we end at y=9 at turn39.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut we can choose the first one: two S's then nine U's.\n\nBut wait: we have 11 actions: two S and nine U? But we go from 0 to 9: that requires 9 U's. So yes.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter two S's, we are at y=0 at turn30. Then we do 9 U's: at turn31:1, 32:2, 33:3, 34:4, 35:5, 36:6, 37:7, 38:8, and then at turn39: we are at 9? But the last action is at turn38: we do U to go from 8 to 9 at turn39.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn28: S\nTurn29: S\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: U\nTurn38: U\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nWe could also do:\n\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: D\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\n... same until turn38: U -> 11 actions.\n\nBut the first one is simpler.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with 10 actions? That would mean we end at turn37 (28+10-1=37) at y=9.\n\nBut we must be at y=0 at turn30. Then from turn30 to turn37: we have 7 actions (turn30 to turn36). We can only get to y=7 at turn37. Then we are not at y=9. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut wait: what if we do not go through all freeways? We must go from 0 to 9, so we have to go through 1,2,...,8.\n\nBut we cannot skip.\n\nSo we output the sequence.\n\nBut note: we have to write the actions for turns starting at t1=28.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Here H=11, so t from 0 to 10? \n\nt=0: turn28\nt=1: turn29\n...\nt=10: turn38\n\nSo the last action is at turn38, and at turn39 we are at y=9.\n\nNow, let me double-check the freeway7 and 8: we are at freeway7 at turn37: which is safe? Yes, because freeway7 is blocked at 34,35,36, not 37.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn38: safe.\n\nAnd we avoided freeways1-6 at turn30 by being at y=0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Here H=11.\n\nBut in the answer format, we only write the actions, not H.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 11 actions? The last turn is 38? And we started at 28? That is 11 actions: 28 to 38 inclusive is 11 turns? 38-28+1=11.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so H=11, t from 0 to 10: 11 actions.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nWe could also do the U then D, but that would be:\n\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: D\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\n...\nTurn38: U\n\nBut that also has 11 actions. We can choose the first one.\n\nBut to be safe, let me check the freeway for the down move:\n\nAt turn29: we are at y=1 (freeway1). Blocked? Only at turn30 -> safe.\n\nAt turn29: we move down to y=0 -> at turn30: y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut the first sequence is more straightforward.\n\nSo I'll go with the two S's then nine U's.\n\nBut note: we have to write the actions for the turns.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 28, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid the following collision conditions:\n\n- Freeways 1 to 6 are blocked at turn 30. To avoid this, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) for turns 28 and 29, reaching \\(y = 0\\) at turn 30.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are blocked at turns 34, 35, and 36. The sequence ensures the player passes freeway 7 at turn 37 and freeway 8 at turn 38, which are safe.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 28**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding freeways and thus collisions.\n- **Turn 29**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), safe for turn 30.\n- **Turn 30**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 is only blocked at turn 30, but at turn 30 the player was at \\(y = 0\\) (safe), and at turn 31 the player is at \\(y = 1\\), which is safe.\n- **Turns 31 to 38**: Move up (U) each turn to increment \\(y\\) by 1 per turn. Freeways 1 to 6 are only blocked at turn 30, so they are safe at turns 31 to 36. Freeway 7 is blocked at turns 34-36, but the player is at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 37, which is safe. Freeway 8 is blocked at turns 34-36, but the player is at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 38, which is safe. The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 39.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 11\\)) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 28: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 30: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 35: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 32 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. Cars are on specific freeways, and they move left or right based on their direction. Since the grid is 1D in x, and we're only concerned with x=0 for collision.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so x is always 0, and y changes vertically. Freeways are rows y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=0, which is not a freeway, and need to reach y=9, also not a freeway. So I only need to worry about collisions when I'm on y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, then collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I go from y_T to y_{T+1}, I'm only on y_T at turn T, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So if I move, I'm only considered on one row per turn.\n\nNow, car updates: for a car, at turn t1 (which is 32), we have its head and tail. Direction: if right, it moves right, so positions increase; if left, positions decrease. In the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway at turn 32.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's moving right, tail is left, head is right? The notation says: for left-moving, span [h, τ], but here direction is right, so for right-moving, span [τ, h], I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nNow, is this (head, tail, direction, speed) or something else?\n\nIt says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSince direction is right, head should be the right end, tail left end, so span should be [tail, head] = [-83, -48] at t1=32.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 1, car: τ = -83, h = -48, s=36, d=right\n\nAt turn T, span = [-83 + 36*(T-32), -48 + 36*(T-32)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) so same car? Or different car with same parameters. But since same freeway, and only one car listed, so one car.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) so τ=-71, h=-48, s=24\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFor each, since right, span at t1=32: for first car, head=48, tail=37? But tail should be left, head right, so if head=48, tail=37, that means tail=37, head=48, so span [37,48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=12, tail=1, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, span [-35,-24]\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have 0 in their span at different turns.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if for the freeway I'm on, y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in the span at that exact turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=32, and I need to go to y=9, which is above, so I probably need to move up, so actions U or S, D might not be useful unless I need to avoid something.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H might be just going up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn after 32, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer turns.\n\nAlso, since the spans are intervals, and they move at constant speed.\n\nLet me define the time from t1=32.\n\nSet τ = T - 32, so turn offset.\n\nAt τ=0, which is t=32.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nCar: span at T: [ -83 + 36*τ , -48 + 36*τ ] where τ = T-32\n\n0 is in span if -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ\n\nSo -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36τ ≤ 83 ⇒ τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ ≤ 2 since τ integer? τ is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nT is integer turn, so τ integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 36τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so τ ≥ 2? Since τ integer.\n\nτ ≥ ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nAnd τ ≤ floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\n83/36 = 2.305, floor is 2.\n\nτ ≤ floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nτ ≥ ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nSo τ=2.\n\nThus for freeway 1, at τ=2 (T=34), 0 is covered.\n\nFor other τ, not covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same parameters, so also covered only at τ=2, T=34.\n\nFreeway 3: same, covered only at τ=2, T=34.\n\nNow freeway 4: car with τ=-71, h=-48, s=24, d=right\n\nSpan at T: [ -71 + 24τ , -48 + 24τ ]\n\n0 in span: -71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ\n\nFirst: -71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 24τ ≤ 71 ⇒ τ ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so τ ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 24τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSo τ=2\n\nThus freeway 4 covered at τ=2, T=34\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same, so covered at τ=2, T=34.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37? At t1, span [37,48] for right-moving, but head and tail: in the tuple it's (48,37,right,4), so I think head=48, tail=37, so since right, tail=37, head=48, span [37,48] at τ=0.\n\nAt T, span: [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ]\n\n0 in [37+4τ, 48+4τ] ?\n\nSince 37+4τ to 48+4τ, all positive since τ≥0, min is 37>0, so 0 not in this interval ever, because 37+4τ ≥37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), so tail=1, head=12, span [1+4τ, 12+4τ] at T.\n\n0 in [1+4τ, 12+4τ]?\n\n1+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12+4τ?\n\n1+4τ ≤0? 4τ ≤ -1, impossible since τ≥0.\n\nSo never, because 1+4τ ≥1>0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), tail=-35, head=-24, span [-35 +4τ, -24 +4τ]\n\n0 in [-35+4τ, -24+4τ]\n\nSo -35+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -24+4τ\n\nFirst: -35+4τ ≤0 ⇒ 4τ ≤35 ⇒ τ ≤ 35/4=8.75, so τ≤8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24+4τ ⇒ 24 ≤4τ ⇒ τ ≥6\n\nSo τ from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nτ=6,7,8\n\nAt τ=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 ≤0≤0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nAt τ=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], -7≤0≤4, yes.\n\nAt τ=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], -3≤0≤8, yes.\n\nAt τ=9: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 1≤0≤12? 0<1, so 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nSo for freeway 7, third car covers x=0 at τ=6,7,8 (T=38,39,40)\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, so also covered at τ=6,7,8 (T=38,39,40)\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied:\n\ny=1: occupied at T=34 (τ=2)\n\ny=2: same, T=34\n\ny=3: same, T=34\n\ny=4: occupied at T=34\n\ny=5: same, T=34\n\ny=6: same, T=34\n\ny=7: occupied at T=38,39,40\n\ny=8: occupied at T=38,39,40\n\nAt other times, no car at x=0 for those freeways.\n\nNow, I start at t=32, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, which is 9 steps up, so minimum 9 turns if I always go up.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut since I start at safe row, and end at safe row, and rows 1-8 might have dangers.\n\nThe collisions only matter when I am on that row at that turn.\n\nSo, for example, at T=32, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions: U, D, S, each changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nGoal: y = 9.\n\nMinimal H, so probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nNow, the occupied times:\n\nSpecifically, for row y=1 to y=6, they are occupied only at T=34.\n\nFor y=7 and y=8, occupied at T=38,39,40.\n\nAt other times, all rows are safe.\n\nT=34 is only one turn, and it affects all rows y=1 to y=6 simultaneously? But I can only be on one row at a time.\n\nThe issue is that if I am on any of y=1 to y=6 at T=34, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=7 or y=8 at T=38,39, or 40, collide.\n\nNow, since T=34 is early, and I start at t=32, let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, minimal time: if I go straight up, U each turn.\n\nStart t=32, y=0\n\nt=33: U, y=1\n\nt=34: U, y=2\n\nBut at t=34, if I am on y=2, and y=2 is occupied at t=34, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at t=33, then at t=34 if I stay or move, if I move to y=2 at t=34, I am on y=2 at t=34, collide.\n\nIf at t=33 I am on y=1, and at t=34 I do S, stay on y=1, then collide because y=1 occupied.\n\nIf I do D at t=34, go to y=0, but at t=34 I am on y=1 if I was there, still collide.\n\nThe collision is at the turn when I am on the row.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, and if for that freeway, 0 occupied, collide.\n\nSo for t=34, if I am on any y from 1 to 6, I collide.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=34, I must not be on rows 1-6 at t=34.\n\nWhere can I be at t=34?\n\nI start at t=32, y=0.\n\nAt t=33, I can be at y=0,1, or if I go down, but y=0 is min, so y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at t=33 I am y=0 (by doing S or D, but D from y=0: y=0, D would go to y=-1, but y must be >=0, so I assume y cannot go below 0, so from y=0, D is invalid or stays? The update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, -1) =0? Similarly for y=9 and U.\n\nThe condition: y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy=-1, y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so must be clipped to 0, I think. Similarly for up.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so actions are constrained such that y stays in bounds. So from y=0, D is not possible or results in y=0. Similarly, U to y=9, U not possible or y=9.\n\nIn the action, if a_t=D and y_t=0, y_{t+1} =0. Similarly for U at y=9.\n\nBut here, at start, y=0, so possible actions: U to y=1, or S to y=0.\n\nCannot D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot U.\n\nBack to t=32: y=0\n\nt=33: I can go to y=1 (U) or stay y=0 (S)\n\nNow, at t=34, I need to not be on y=1-6.\n\nIf I am at y=0 at t=33, then at t=34, I can:\n\n- S: stay y=0\n\n- U: go to y=1\n\n- D: but y=0, D would stay y=0? Or invalid, but as above, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy for D is -1, so y=0 + (-1) = -1, not in [0,9], so probably it stays 0 or action not allowed. I think we assume actions are chosen such that y in bounds, so from y=0, only S or U possible, not D. Similarly, from y=9, only S or D, not U.\n\nSo at t=33, if y=0, actions: S (y=0) or U (y=1)\n\nAt t=34, if I am on y=0, safe.\n\nIf on y=1, and t=34, y=1 occupied, collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I was at y=1 at t=33, then at t=34, if S, y=1, collide; if U, y=2, collide; if D, to y=0, but at t=34 I am on y=1 when I do action, so collide.\n\nWhen I perform action at turn T, I am on y_T before moving? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), then I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is at turn T, based on y_T, the row I am on at that turn.\n\nFor turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and check if occupied at T.\n\nThen after action, I move to y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, at t=34, for collision, it depends on where I am at the start of turn t=34, i.e., y_{34}.\n\nIf y_{34} is between 1 and 6, and since occupied at t=34, collide.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=34, I must have y_{34} not in {1,2,3,4,5,6}.\n\nPossible values: y_{34} = 0 or 7 or 8 or 9, but y=9 is far, not possible yet.\n\nFrom t=32 to t=34, only two actions, so y_{34} can be 0,1,2.\n\n- If I do S at t=32 and S at t=33: y_{33}=0, y_{34}=0\n\n- S at t=32, U at t=33: y_{33}=1, y_{34}=? at t=33, y=1, then t=34 action: if S, y_{34}=1; if U, y_{34}=2; if D, y_{34}=0 but when I do D at t=33, from y=1, y_{34}=0, but at t=33 I am on y=1.\n\nBut for t=34 collision, it depends on y_{34}, not y_{33}.\n\ny_T is position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nThen I choose a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if on y_T and occupied at T.\n\nSo for t=34, if y_{34} in 1-6, collide.\n\ny_{34} can be 0,1,2 as above.\n\ny_{34}=0 is safe, y_{34}=1 or 2 would collide.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at t=34, I must have y_{34}=0.\n\nWhich means at t=33, I must be at y=0, and do S at t=33? Let's see.\n\nAt t=32, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{32}, y_{33} is set.\n\nThen at t=33, y_{33} is position, then a_{33} determines y_{34}.\n\nTo have y_{34}=0.\n\ny_{34} = y_{33} + Δy_{33}\n\nIf y_{33} =0, then Δy_{33} must be 0 (S), so y_{34}=0\n\nIf y_{33}=1, then Δy_{33} = -1 (D), so y_{34}=0\n\nBut from t=32, to get to y_{33}=1 or 0.\n\nCase: if at t=32, I do S, then y_{33}=0\n\nThen at t=33, I can do S, y_{34}=0\n\nOr do U, y_{34}=1\n\nBut to have y_{34}=0, I need to do S at t=33.\n\nIf at t=32, I do U, then y_{33}=1\n\nThen at t=33, I can do S, y_{34}=1; or U, y_{34}=2; or D, y_{34}=0\n\nSo to have y_{34}=0, I can:\n\n- a_{32}=S, then a_{33}=S: y_{33}=0, y_{34}=0\n\n- or a_{32}=U, then a_{33}=D: y_{33}=1, y_{34}=0\n\nIn both cases, y_{34}=0, safe at t=34.\n\nNow, if I do a_{32}=U and a_{33}=D, at t=33 I am on y=1, which is freeway, and at t=33, is y=1 occupied?\n\nWe need to check for each turn and each row.\n\nWe have occupied only at specific turns.\n\nFor y=1, we said occupied only at t=34, not at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt t=33, τ=1 (since τ=T-32, t=33, τ=1)\n\nFor freeway 1: at τ=1, span: [ -83 + 36*1, -48 + 36*1] = [-47, -12], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all y=1 to 6, at τ=1, T=33:\n\nFor y=1: span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: at τ=1, span [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24], all negative, 0 not in.\n\ny=5,6 same.\n\ny=7: at τ=1, T=33, for the third car, span [-35+4, -24+4] = [-31,-20], negative, 0 not in. Other cars not near 0.\n\nSo at t=33, all rows are safe, since no occupation at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=32, τ=0, all cars not at 0 except we know only at specific τ.\n\nSo at t=33, I can be on y=1 safely.\n\nThen back to options.\n\nTo avoid t=34 collision, I need y_{34}=0.\n\nI can either:\n\nOption A: a_{32}=S, a_{33}=S → y_{33}=0, y_{34}=0\n\nOption B: a_{32}=U, a_{33}=D → y_{33}=1, y_{34}=0\n\nIn both cases, at t=34, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, after that, I need to go up.\n\nBut there is another danger at later times for y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 occupied at t=38,39,40.\n\nt=38,39,40 are τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=34, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 9 steps, but I might need to delay or something.\n\nMinimal time: if I go straight up from here, how fast can I go.\n\nt=34: y=0\n\nI can start going up.\n\nBut at t=38,39,40, if I am on y=7 or y=8, collide.\n\nNow, let's see the timeline.\n\nSet t from 34 onwards.\n\nt=34: y=0 (safe)\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nEach U increases y by 1.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=38,39,40.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 are only dangerous at those times, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, y=0 at t=34.\n\nSuppose I go up as fast as possible.\n\nt=34: U to y=1\n\nt=35: U to y=2\n\nt=36: U to y=3\n\nt=37: U to y=4\n\nt=38: U to y=5\n\nBut at t=38, if I go to y=5, I am on y=5 at t=38? At turn t=38, I am at y_{38}, then I choose action to go to y_{39}.\n\nAt t=38, if y_{38}=5, and y=5 is not occupied at t=38, because y=1-6 only occupied at t=34, not before or after, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=39: if I U to y=6, y_{39}=6, safe.\n\nt=40: U to y=7, y_{40}=7.\n\nBut at t=40, y=7 is occupied (since τ=8, T=40), so if y_{40}=7, collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=40 I am on y=7, and t=40 is occupied for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=8 at t=40, also occupied.\n\ny=7 and 8 occupied t=38,39,40.\n\nSo at t=40, if I am on y=7 or 8, collide.\n\nIn the above, at t=40, y=7, collide.\n\nI could stay or move differently.\n\nAnother idea: I need to not be on y=7 or 8 at t=38,39,40.\n\nBut I can be on other rows.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are dangerous only at those times, I can be there before or after.\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=7 before t=38 or after t=40.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, from t=34, y=0, to y=9.\n\nThe distance is 9 rows.\n\nEach turn I can increase y by 0 or 1 or decrease, but decreasing might not help.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible, except when I need to wait to avoid the danger times.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical period.\n\nt=38,39,40 are dangerous for y=7 and 8.\n\nI need to cross rows 7 and 8 outside of these times.\n\nNow, the time from t=34 to, say, t=41.\n\nt=34: y=0\n\nI need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, so at t=43, y=9 if start from t=34.\n\nBut I might take more turns if I wait.\n\nt=34: y=0\n\nIf I go directly:\n\nt=34: y=0\n\nt=35: y=1\n\nt=36: y=2\n\nt=37: y=3\n\nt=38: y=4\n\nt=39: y=5\n\nt=40: y=6\n\nt=41: y=7\n\nt=42: y=8\n\nt=43: y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=38: y=4, which is safe (only dangerous at t=34 for y=1-6)\n\nt=39: y=5, safe\n\nt=40: y=6, safe\n\nt=41: y=7, now t=41, τ=9 (since τ=T-32, t=41, τ=9)\n\nFor y=7, at τ=9, T=41, is it occupied?\n\nFor freeway 7, third car: at τ=9, span [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe. Similarly for y=8.\n\nt=42: y=8, τ=10, span for y=8 third car: [-35+40, -24+40] = [5,16], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=43: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=34 to t=43, all positions are safe?\n\nAt t=41: y=7, τ=9, not occupied.\n\nt=42: y=8, τ=10, not occupied.\n\nt=43: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=34, we have y=0, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, I go directly up from t=34: U each turn from t=34 to t=42, to reach y=9 at t=43.\n\nt=34: action U to y=1? Let's list the actions from t=32.\n\nFirst, I need to set the initial actions to have y_{34}=0.\n\nThen from there.\n\nIn the above path, from t=34 y=0, I start going up.\n\nBut in the sequence I listed, at t=41 y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut earlier I thought t=38,39,40 are dangerous, but in this path, at t=38 I am at y=4, not 7 or 8; t=39 y=5; t=40 y=6; all safe.\n\nThen t=41 y=7, safe; t=42 y=8, safe; t=43 y=9.\n\nBut y=6 at t=40: is it safe? y=6 is freeway, but we said only occupied at t=34, not at t=40. t=40 is τ=8, for y=6, which has car, but at τ=8, for y=6 car: span [-71 + 24*8, -48 + 24*8] = [-71+192, -48+192] = [121,144], all positive, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut I start from t=32.\n\nNow, with y_{34}=0.\n\nI need to choose how to get there.\n\nOption A: a_{32}=S, a_{33}=S: then y_{33}=0, y_{34}=0\n\nThen from t=34: U, y=1 at t=35? Let's list turns.\n\nTurn t=32: position y=0\n\nAction a_{32}: determines y_{33}\n\nTurn t=33: position y_{33}, action a_{33} determines y_{34}\n\netc.\n\nIn option A: a_{32}=S, so y_{33}=0\n\na_{33}=S, so y_{34}=0\n\nThen t=34: position y=0, action a_{34} to go to y_{35}\n\nNow, to go up: I can do a_{34}=U, to y=1 at t=35\n\na_{35}=U, to y=2 at t=36\n\na_{36}=U, to y=3 at t=37\n\na_{37}=U, to y=4 at t=38\n\na_{38}=U, to y=5 at t=39\n\na_{39}=U, to y=6 at t=40\n\na_{40}=U, to y=7 at t=41\n\na_{41}=U, to y=8 at t=42\n\na_{42}=U, to y=9 at t=43\n\nAt t=43, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check if any collision: all y positions during t=35 to t=42: at t=35 y=1, t=36 y=2, ..., up to t=42 y=8.\n\nAt each, for the row, at that turn, not occupied except as before.\n\nFor example, at t=35, y=1, τ=3 (T=35, τ=35-32=3), for y=1: span [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, all rows 1-6 at later times are safe.\n\nAt t=41, y=7, τ=9, as above, not occupied.\n\nt=42, y=8, τ=10, not occupied.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut H is from t=32 to t=43, that's 12 turns? Turns from t=32 to t=43, but number of actions.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=32 to t=42, that's 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=32, position given.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=32 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t=32 + H.\n\nDefine: after t actions, at turn t_1 + t.\n\nAt turn T, after t actions from start? Better to think of the turn index.\n\nStart at turn t=32, position y_{32}=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 32.\n\nAfter first action a_{32}, at turn 33, y_{33}.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 32 + k, y_{32+k}\n\nWe need y_{32+H} = 9? No.\n\nThe player reaches (0,9) at some turn, say T_final.\n\nThe number of turns from start: H is the number of actions, so after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, and y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSo the position at turn t_1 + H is 9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=32, so at turn 32 + H, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence, with H=11 actions? Let's list:\n\nActions:\n\na_{32}, a_{33}, a_{34}, ..., up to a_{42}, then at turn 43, y=9.\n\nSo actions from t=32 to t=42, that's 11 actions: t=32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42.\n\nt from 0 to 10? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet t_1=32.\n\nAction indices: t=0 to H-1, so actions at time 32, 33, ..., 32+H-1.\n\nAfter last action, at time 32+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence: if I do actions from a_{32} to a_{42}, that's 11 actions (t=0 to 10? t_1 + t for t=0 to 10, that's 11 actions), then at time 32+11=43, y=9.\n\nBut in my earlier, with a_{32}=S, a_{33}=S, then a_{34} to a_{42} all U, that's 9 U from t=34 to 42, but actions include a_{32} and a_{33}.\n\nTotal actions: a_{32}, a_{33}, and then a_{34} to a_{42} that's 9 more, total 11 actions.\n\nBut at turn 43, y=9.\n\nIs this minimal?\n\nI could start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, option B: a_{32}=U, a_{33}=D, so y_{33}=1 (at t=33), y_{34}=0 (at t=34)\n\nThen from t=34, same as above, y=0.\n\nThen same actions from t=34: U each turn to y=9 at t=43.\n\nBut at t=33, I was at y=1, which is safe, as we checked.\n\nThen actions: a_{32}=U, a_{33}=D, then a_{34} to a_{42} U, same 11 actions to reach at t=43.\n\nIn terms of number, same H.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I don't stay at y=0 at t=34, but go up faster.\n\nBut at t=34, if I am not at y=0, I collide, as we must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\ny_{34} must be 0.\n\nSo I cannot be higher at t=34.\n\nThus, the earliest I can start going up is from t=34 y=0.\n\nThen to go to y=9, minimum 9 turns, so arrive at t=43.\n\nWith 11 actions: from t=32 to t=42 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, with option A: a_{32}=S, a_{33}=S, then a_{34} to a_{42} all U.\n\nOr option B: a_{32}=U, a_{33}=D, then a_{34} to a_{42} U.\n\nIn option B, at t=33, I go to y=1 and back, but it doesn't save time.\n\nNow, but in the path to y=9, I passed y=7 at t=41, which is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the danger at t=38,39,40, but in this path I was not on y=7 or 8 at those times, so fine.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose from t=32, I go up immediately, but then at t=34 I would be on y=2 or something and collide.\n\nFor example, if a_{32}=U, y_{33}=1\n\nThen at t=33, if I do U, y_{34}=2, but at t=34 y=2, collide.\n\nIf at t=33 I do S, y_{34}=1, collide.\n\nIf do D, y_{34}=0, but at t=34 y=0, safe, which is option B.\n\nBut I cannot be higher than y=0 at t=34 without colliding.\n\nThus, y=0 at t=34 is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the earliest arrival is at t=43 with y=9.\n\nWith actions: for example, S at t=32, S at t=33, then U from t=34 to t=42.\n\nt=34 to t=42 is 9 actions U, plus t=32 and t=33, total 11 actions.\n\nt=32 action, t=33 action, t=34 to t=42 actions, that's 2 + 9 =11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at turn 43, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at t=41 y=7, but y=7 is safe at t=41.\n\nSimilarly, no issue with y=8 at t=42.\n\nBut we have the later danger for y=7 and 8 at t=38,39,40, but I was not there.\n\nBut is there a way to go faster by being on higher rows earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=3 or something at t=34, but I cannot because at t=34, if y=1-6, collide, so only y=0 possible.\n\nUnless I can be at y=7 or 8 at t=34, but from t=32 to t=34, only two actions, maximum y=2, so impossible to be at y=7 or 8.\n\nSo y_{34} must be 0.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from t=32 onwards.\n\nIn the answer, it should list actions for each turn starting from t_1=32.\n\nNow, with option A or B.\n\nBut in both, I reach at same time.\n\nNow, but in option B, I go to y=1 at t=33 and back, which is fine, but I used a down action, which might not be necessary, but it doesn't hurt.\n\nTo have all up except the necessary at beginning.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up after.\n\nBut another thing: I need to avoid the y=7 and 8 danger, but in this path I did avoid.\n\nBut suppose I want to reach earlier, but I don't think so.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions, but I lost two actions at beginning to stay at y=0, so 11 total.\n\nIf I could be at y=0 at t=34 with fewer actions, but from t=32, I need at least one action to stay or something, but I start at t=32, so to be at same position, I need actions.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, but I have to take actions each turn.\n\nAt t=32, I must take an action: S or U.\n\nIf S, y=0; if U, y=1.\n\nThen at t=33, similarly.\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=34, I need two actions as above.\n\nSo no way with less than 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nFirst, with option A: S at t=32, S at t=33, then U from t=34 to t=42.\n\nt=42 action to go to y=9 at t=43.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nThen at turn 43, y=9.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=32: y=0\n\nt=33: y=0 (after S)\n\nt=34: y=0 (after S at t=33)\n\nThen t=35: y=1 (after U at t=34)\n\nt=36: y=2\n\nt=37: y=3\n\nt=38: y=4\n\nt=39: y=5\n\nt=40: y=6\n\nt=41: y=7\n\nt=42: y=8\n\nt=43: y=9\n\nAll safe as before.\n\nWith option B:\n\nTurn 32: U  (to y=1 at t=33)\n\nTurn 33: D  (to y=0 at t=34)\n\nThen Turn 34: U\n\n...\n\nSame as above from t=34 onwards.\n\nBut at t=33, y=1, which is safe, as we checked.\n\nBut in this case, I used a down action, which might be fine, but perhaps not minimal in the sense of actions, but H is same.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for y=7 and 8, I passed at t=41 and t=42, which are after the danger period.\n\nBut the danger was at t=38,39,40, so after is fine.\n\nCould I pass y=7 and 8 before t=38?\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at t=34, I am at y=0, so to be at y=7, I need at least 7 up actions.\n\nFrom t=34, if I do U each turn:\n\nt=34: U to y=1 at t=35\n\nt=35: U to y=2 at t=36\n\nt=36: U to y=3 at t=37\n\nt=37: U to y=4 at t=38\n\nt=38: U to y=5 at t=39\n\nt=39: U to y=6 at t=40\n\nt=40: U to y=7 at t=41\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I could start from higher, but I cannot.\n\nSuppose I go up faster after t=34, but I can only increase by one per turn, so minimum to y=7 is t=41.\n\nSimilarly, to y=8 at t=42, y=9 at t=43.\n\nSo cannot be earlier.\n\nThus, H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if at t=41 y=7 is indeed safe.\n\nt=41, τ=9, T=41.\n\nFreeway y=7: cars, third car: span [-35 + 4*9, -24 + 4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not near.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=42, τ=10, span [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16], no 0.\n\nAnd y=9 not freeway.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at t=43.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, I need to output for turns starting from t_1=32.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 32: a_{32}\n\nTurn 33: a_{33}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 32+H-1: a_{32+H-1}\n\nWith y_{32+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=11, so actions from turn 32 to turn 42.\n\nWith the sequence.\n\nBut in option B, I have a down action, which might be unnecessary, so perhaps option A is simpler with only up and stay.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nTo make it with minimal actions, but same H.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly without staying, but I have to avoid t=34.\n\nAnother idea: could I be at y=7 or 8 at t=34? But impossible, as max y=2.\n\nOr y=9, no.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence is fixed.\n\nBut in the beginning, I need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, I can write with S and U.\n\nBut let's see if I can start going up earlier with option B.\n\nIn option B, at t=33 I am at y=1, which is freeway, but safe, and I go down to y=0 at t=34.\n\nBut since I go down, I wasted an up, but I have to be at y=0 anyway.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nFrom t=32 to t=43, that's 12 turns, but with actions.\n\nStart turn t=32, position given.\n\nAfter first action, turn t=33, position y_{33}\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action, turn t=32+k, position y_{32+k}\n\nWe need y_{32+H} =9.\n\nAt turn t=32, before any action, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=32+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=32 to t=32+H-1.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T, with T=43, so 43 = 32 + H, so H=11.\n\nActions at turns 32 to 42.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with all U except the first two S.\n\nBut in option A.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier if I don't have to stay, but I do.\n\nAnother thought: at t=34, I am at y=0, but if I could be at y=0 at t=34 with one action, but from t=32, with one action, I can be at y=0 or y=1 at t=33, but at t=34 I need to be at y=0, which requires another action.\n\nSo minimum two actions to be at y=0 at t=34 from start.\n\nThus H=11.\n\nBut let's list the actions clearly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I think I handled correctly.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at other times there are collisions, but I think not.\n\nFor example, at t=35, y=1, as above, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 34 to 42, that's 9 U, but turn 34 action to go to y=1 at t=35, etc.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list actions for each turn.\n\nNow, at turn 42, action U to go to y=9 at t=43.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1}\"\n\nIn the text: \"minimal number of turns H\" but I think H is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"after H actions, reach at turn t1 + H\".\n\nIn the answer, H=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then at turn 32+10=42, y=9.\n\nThen actions from t=32 to t=41.\n\nAt turn 42, y=9.\n\nNow, y_{42} =9.\n\nBut y_{42} is after action at t=41.\n\nNow, to have y_{42}=9, from start y_{32}=0, I need net +9 in y, with 10 actions.\n\nSince each action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to have net +9 in 10 actions, possible, for example, 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U but y max 9, so if I go to y=9 earlier, I have to stay or something.\n\nBut at t=34, y_{34} must be 0.\n\nNow, from t=32 to t=34, two actions.\n\ny_{34} = y_{32} + Δy_{32} + Δy_{33} = 0 + Δy_{32} + Δy_{33}\n\nSince y_{34}=0, so Δy_{32} + Δy_{33} =0.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so possible: both 0, or +1 and -1.\n\nThus, as before.\n\nThen from t=34 to t=42, with 8 actions? Actions at t=34 to t=41 for H=10? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=32 to t=41, that's 10 actions (t=0 to 9? t_1 + t for t=0 to 9, 10 actions).\n\nThen at turn t=32+10=42, y=9.\n\nNow, from y_{34}=0 to y_{42}=9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=34 to t=41: actions at t=34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41, that's 8 actions.\n\nTo change y from 0 to 9 in 8 actions, I need at least 9 up moves, but 8 actions, impossible to increase by 9 with 8 actions.\n\nNet change: each action can increase by at most 1, so from y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions required.\n\nTherefore, with y_{34}=0, I need at least 9 actions from there to reach y=9, so actions from t=34 to t=42 (9 actions), arrive at t=43.\n\nPlus the two actions at t=32 and t=33, total 11 actions.\n\nIf I could have y_{34} >0, but I cannot, because must be 0 to avoid collision.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the sequence as above.\n\nIn the sequence, I used S at beginning, but I can use the down option, but not necessary.\n\nNow for the answer, I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 38,39,40, I am at y=4,5,6, which are safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the position and time.\n\nTurn | Action | y after action (i.e., at next turn)\n\nBetter to list position at turn and action.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then action a_T, then position at T+1 is y_T + Δy.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, position y_T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 32: position y=0, action S (say), so y_{33}=0\n\nTurn 33: position y=0, action S, so y_{34}=0\n\nTurn 34: position y=0, action U, so y_{35}=1\n\nTurn 35: position y=1, action U, so y_{36}=2\n\nTurn 36: position y=2, action U, so y_{37}=3\n\nTurn 37: position y=3, action U, so y_{38}=4\n\nTurn 38: position y=4, action U, so y_{39}=5\n\nTurn 39: position y=5, action U, so y_{40}=6\n\nTurn 40: position y=6, action U, so y_{41}=7\n\nTurn 41: position y=7, action U, so y_{42}=8\n\nTurn 42: position y=8, action U, so y_{43}=9\n\nAt each turn, collision check:\n\nt=32: y=0, not freeway, safe\n\nt=33: y=0, safe\n\nt=34: y=0, safe\n\nt=35: y=1, freeway, but at t=35, not occupied, safe\n\nSimilarly t=36: y=2, safe\n\nt=37: y=3, safe\n\nt=38: y=4, safe\n\nt=39: y=5, safe\n\nt=40: y=6, safe\n\nt=41: y=7, at t=41, τ=9, not occupied, safe\n\nt=42: y=8, at t=42, τ=10, not occupied, safe\n\nt=43: y=9, safe, but not part of action sequence.\n\nAll good.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nThe initial turn is t1=32.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 32: S \\\\ Turn 33: S \\\\ Turn 34: U \\\\ Turn 35: U \\\\ Turn 36: U \\\\ Turn 37: U \\\\ Turn 38: U \\\\ Turn 39: U \\\\ Turn 40: U \\\\ Turn 41: U \\\\ Turn 42: U }\n\nBut Turn 42: U to go to y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 32\\) is 11. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any occupied freeway at the critical turns.\n\n### Collision Analysis Summary:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are occupied only at turn \\(T = 34\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = T - 32 = 2\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are occupied at turns \\(T = 38, 39, 40\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n\nTo avoid collision at \\(T = 34\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at that turn.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 34. The goal is to reach (0, 9) with minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars moving left or right with given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 (the player's x-position) is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: When you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are still on y, and at turn T+1 you are on y+1. So you only check collision for the freeway you're currently on at each turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=34, and we need to find their positions at future turns based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at t_1=34:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, head is larger than tail? The notation says for right-moving: span [τ, h] with h > τ? Let me check.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so h decreases.\n\nFor left-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ should be such that h > τ, I think, but it says [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the example, for left-moving, it might be that h is the front.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, for right-moving, τ is the tail, h is the head, so τ < h, and as time increases, both increase since moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h is head, τ is tail, with h > τ? But in the span [h, τ], if h > τ, it's decreasing, but usually we denote intervals with min to max.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at freeway 7 and 8: cars like (48, 37, right, 4), so for right-moving, head=48, tail=37? But 48>37, so span [τ, h] = [37,48] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36), so τ=-83, h=-48, since -48 > -83, so span [-83, -48] at t_1.\n\nFor left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h > τ, but moving left, h decreases.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the given state.\n\nFreeway 1 to 6: all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: multiple cars, all right-moving with speed 4.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) → tail τ=-83, head h=-48, span at t_1: [-83, -48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same, (-48, -83, right, 36) → [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36) → [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) → tail τ=-71, head h=-48, span [-71, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-48, -71, right, 24) → [-71, -48]\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48, -71, right, 24) → [-71, -48]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor each, span: [37,48], [1,12], [-35,-24] at t_1=34.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn t_1=34, player is at (0,0), so not on any freeway, so no collision at t_1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to pass through freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nEach action changes y by -1, 0, or +1.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or move down, so H could be more than 9 if we detour.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so probably go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so at turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to after H-1 actions, at turn t_1 + (H-1), we have y_{t_1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn t_1, player position is given as (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we are at (0, y_{t_1 +1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T when we are on a freeway y_T, meaning if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, after action or initial, we are at y_T, and collision if y_T in 1-8 and 0 in car span at T.\n\nFor the action sequence, at turn t_1, we take a_{t_1}, which moves us to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThe position y_{t_1} is given, and we start by taking action at t_1 to go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nIn the collision note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T, and you take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T, collision is based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, based on y_{T+1} and cars at T+1.\n\nWhen you move, at the moment of moving, you are not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, we need to increase y by 9, so minimum 9 up moves, but we can have stays or down, so H >=9, and if we go straight up, H=9, but we need to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns 0 is covered by a car, so that if player is on that freeway at that turn, collision.\n\nSince cars move, we need the position over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t_1=34.\n\nFor a future turn T, the car span on a freeway.\n\nFirst, for freeway k, the cars at turn T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for each car, where (τ, h, d, s) given at t_1.\n\nd is direction, all right, so yes.\n\nThen 0 in span if min <= 0 <= max of the span.\n\nSince multiple cars, we need if 0 in any car's span on that freeway.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find the times when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-34), h + s(T-34)] = [-83 + 36(T-34), -48 + 36(T-34)]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36(T-34) <= 0 <= -48 + 36(T-34)\n\nSet Δt = T - 34, so for Δt >=0.\n\nThen:\n\n-83 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n-83 + 36 Δt <= 0  => 36 Δt <= 83  => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2 since integer turns? Turns are integers, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt  => 48 <= 36 Δt  => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt >= 2 since integer? Δt is integer.\n\nΔt = T - 34, integer >=0.\n\nSo from first inequality: -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 = 2.305, so Δt <= 2\n\nFrom second: 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 48 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >= 2\n\nThus, both: Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so Δt=2.\n\nThus at T=34+2=36, 0 is in span.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nFor example, Δt=1: -83+36= -47 <=0, but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0 <= -12 false.\n\nΔt=2: -83+72= -11 <=0, 0 <= -48+72=24, true.\n\nΔt=3: -83+108=25 <=0? 25<=0 false.\n\nSo only at T=36, freeway 1 has a car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48,-83,right,36), so same, only at T=36, covered.\n\nFreeway 3: same, only T=36 covered.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nτ=-71, h=-48, s=24\n\nSpan at T: [-71 + 24(Δt), -48 + 24(Δt)] with Δt=T-34\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt\n\nFirst: -71 + 24 Δt <=0 => 24 Δt <=71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt => 48 <= 24 Δt => Δt >= 2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, thus only at T=36, Δt=2.\n\nCheck: Δt=2: -71+48= -23 <=0, 0 <= -48+48=0, yes 0<=0.\n\nΔt=1: -71+24= -47 <=0, but 0 <= -48+24= -24? false.\n\nΔt=3: -71+72=1 <=0? false.\n\nSo yes, only T=36.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, only T=36 covered.\n\nFreeway 6: same, only T=36.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) → τ=37, h=48? From (head, tail, dir, speed), for right-moving, head and tail.\n\nIn notation, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 7: (48,37,right,4), so h=48, τ=37, so span [τ, h] at t1: [37,48]\n\nThen at T: [37 + 4(Δt), 48 + 4(Δt)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4) → h=12, τ=1, span [1,12] at t1, at T: [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) → h=-24, τ=-35? (-24,-35,right,4), so τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35,-24] at t1, at T: [-35 + 4Δt, -24 + 4Δt]\n\nNow, 0 covered if 0 in any of these spans.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4Δt, 48 + 4Δt], since min 37+4Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt], min 1+4Δt >=1 >0, so always positive, 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: [-35 + 4Δt, -24 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 4Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-35 + 4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/4 = 8.75, so Δt <=8\n\n0 <= -24 + 4Δt => 24 <= 4Δt => Δt >=6\n\nThus for Δt=6,7,8\n\nCheck:\n\nΔt=6: -35+24= -11 <=0, 0 <= -24+24=0, true\n\nΔt=7: -35+28= -7 <=0, 0 <= -24+28=4, true\n\nΔt=8: -35+32= -3 <=0, 0 <= -24+32=8, true\n\nΔt=5: -35+20= -15 <=0, but 0 <= -24+20= -4? false\n\nΔt=9: -35+36=1 <=0? false\n\nSo for freeway 7, 0 covered at T=34+6=40, 41,42? Δt=6,7,8 so T=40,41,42.\n\nt1=34, Δt=6, T=40; Δt=7,T=41; Δt=8,T=42.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7, so same, 0 covered at T=40,41,42.\n\nNow, freeway 1 to 6 have coverage only at T=36, and freeway 7 and 8 at T=40,41,42.\n\nOther times, no coverage for x=0 on any freeway.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: only T=36, etc.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn t=34.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of turns from t=34 to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nSequence: actions from t=34 to t=34 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k, with y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 +1}, to y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to after a_{t_1 + H -1}, we are at y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t_1 + H.\n\nWe need to be at position for turns t from 34 to t_1 + H -1, but collision only when on freeway, y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and 0 covered on that freeway, collision.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWe need to choose actions so that for each turn T from 34 to t_1 + H -1, when y_T in 1-8, 0 not covered on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we reach y=9, not a freeway, no issue.\n\nMinimal H: since we start at y=0, need to go to y=9, each up move increases y by 1, so minimum 9 up moves, no down or stay, so H=9, arriving at turn t_1 +9 =34+9=43.\n\nIs it possible to go straight up with U every turn?\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nStart at turn 34, y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAction a_{34}: U, so y_{35} =1\n\nAt turn 35, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nAt turn 35, is 0 covered on freeway 1?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 1 has car only at T=36, not at T=35.\n\nAt T=35, Δt=1, freeway 1: span [-83+36(1), -48+36(1)] = [-47, -12], 0 not in [-47,-12], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars on freeway 1.\n\nSo at turn 35, on freeway 1, no collision.\n\nAction a_{35}: U, y_{36}=2\n\nAt turn 36, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt turn 36, freeway 2: but freeway 2 has car only at T=36, covered.\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, at T=36, span [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], 0 in [-11,24], yes covered.\n\nSo at turn 36, if on freeway 2, collision.\n\nBut y=2 at turn 36, so collision.\n\nCannot be on freeway 2 at turn 36.\n\nIn the straight up path: at turn 36, we are on y=2, which is freeway 2, and it is covered, so collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot go straight up.\n\nNeed to avoid being on freeway 2 at turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1,2,3 all covered at T=36, but freeway 1 at T=35 not covered, freeway 3 at T=35: let's see.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=35: Δt=1, span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, so safe at T=35.\n\nAt T=36, covered.\n\nNow, for freeway 4,5,6: covered only at T=36.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=35: Δt=1, span [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut at T=36, covered.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 covered at T=40,41,42.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, we need to go up, but avoid the covered times.\n\nSince freeway 1,2,3,4,5,6 all have coverage at T=36 only, and freeway 7,8 at T=40,41,42.\n\nFreeway 1 to 6: each has coverage only at T=36.\n\nBut they are different freeways, so being on any of them at T=36 is bad.\n\nSpecifically, if at turn 36, y= k for k=1 to 6, then collision since all covered at T=36.\n\ny=1 to 6 are all covered at T=36.\n\nFreeway 1 to 6 all have cars covering x=0 at T=36.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3,4,5,6 all covered at T=36.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 not covered at T=36.\n\nAt T=36, freeway 7: Δt=2, T=36, t1=34, Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 7 third car: [-35 +4*2, -24+4*2] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not cover 0, so freeway 7 safe at T=36.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 covered at T=40,41,42.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=36, we must not be on freeway 1-6 at turn 36.\n\nThat means at turn 36, y_36 must be 0, or 7,8, or 9.\n\nBut y=0,7,8,9.\n\ny=0 not freeway, y=7 freeway 7, but at T=36 freeway 7 safe, similarly y=8 freeway 8 safe, y=9 not freeway.\n\nWe start from y=0 at t=34.\n\nAfter actions.\n\nLet t be the turn.\n\nAt t=34: y=0\n\nAfter a_{34}, y_{35} set.\n\nAt t=35: y_{35}\n\nAfter a_{35}, y_{36} set.\n\nAt t=36: y_{36}\n\nWe need y_{36} not in {1,2,3,4,5,6} to avoid collision.\n\nSo y_{36} must be 0,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- If we can be at y=7 or 8 at t=36, then safe.\n\n- Or at y=0, but that might delay.\n\n- Or at y=9, but that would require reaching earlier, but we start at y=0 t=34, to be at y=9 at t=36, that means in two moves: from y=0 to y=9 in two moves? Impossible, max +1 per move, so y_{36} <= y_{34} + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with |Δy|<=1, so from t=34 to t=36, after two actions, y_{36} can be from 0-2 to 0+2, so y_{36} between 0 and 2 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, y_{36} can only be 0,1, or 2.\n\nBut to avoid collision at t=36, we need y_{36} not in 1-6, but since y_{36} <=2, it must be 0 or 1 or 2.\n\ny_{36} cannot be 7,8,9 because that would require more up moves.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be below 0, but min is 0.\n\nSo possible y_{36} = 0,1,2.\n\nBut if y_{36}=1 or 2, it is in freeway 1 or 2, which are covered at t=36, so collision.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, we must have y_{36} = 0.\n\nThat means at turn 36, we are back at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nNow, how to achieve that.\n\nStart at t=34, y=0.\n\nAction a_{34}: if we do S, y_{35}=0\n\nThen at t=35, y=0, not freeway, no collision.\n\nThen action a_{35}: if we do S again, y_{36}=0, which is good.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nIf a_{34} U, y_{35}=1\n\nAt t=35, y=1, freeway 1, but at t=35, freeway 1 not covered, safe, as we saw.\n\nThen a_{35}: if we do D, y_{36}=1-1=0? y_{36} = y_{35} + Δy =1 + (-1) if D, so y_{36}=0.\n\nThen at t=36, y=0, safe.\n\nIf a_{35} S, y_{36}=1, but then on freeway 1 at t=36, covered, collision.\n\nIf a_{35} U, y_{36}=2, on freeway 2 at t=36, covered, collision.\n\nSo only options: either stay at y=0 for t=35 and t=36, or go up to y=1 at t=35 then down to y=0 at t=36.\n\nIn both cases, y_{36}=0.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 later.\n\nAlso, there is the issue with freeways 7 and 8 at t=40,41,42.\n\nFirst, let's handle the immediate.\n\nTo minimize H, we should not delay unnecessarily.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 for two turns, that adds delay.\n\nGo up and down might be better, but same number of actions to recover.\n\nFrom t=34 to t=36, we must end at y=0.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9.\n\nMinimum additional turns: 9 up moves, so at least 9 actions from t=36 onwards? Not necessarily, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nAfter reaching y_{36}=0, we start from y=0 at t=36.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so minimum 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut we can have more if we stay or go down.\n\nNow, the collision points later.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 covered at t=40,41,42.\n\nt=40,41,42.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on freeway 7 or 8 at those turns if covered, but freeway 7 covered, freeway 8 covered similarly.\n\nSince freeway 7 and 8 are covered at t=40,41,42, we must not be on y=7 at t=40,41,42 or y=8 at t=40,41,42.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, y=8 is freeway 8.\n\nAt t=40,41,42, if on freeway 7 or 8, collision.\n\nSo we need to ensure that at turns 40,41,42, y is not 7 and not 8.\n\nThat is, y_T !=7 and !=8 for T=40,41,42.\n\nPossible to be on other freeways or y=0,9, etc.\n\nNow, we start from t=36, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn with minimal H.\n\nH is the number of actions from t=34 to t=34 + H -1, so that y_{34+H} =9.\n\nSince we must have y_{36}=0, as established.\n\nThen from t=36, y=0, to reach y=9 at turn T = 34 + H.\n\nSet T_final = 34 + H, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nAt t=36, y=0.\n\nThe number of actions from t=36 to T_final -1, but let's think in terms of time.\n\nFrom turn 36 to turn T_final, we need to go from y=0 to y=9, with actions at each turn.\n\nThe number of turns from 36 to T_final inclusive is (T_final - 36 +1) = T_final -35.\n\nBut actions are taken at turns 36 to T_final -1, number of actions: (T_final -1) - 36 +1 = T_final -36.\n\nAfter k actions from turn 36, we are at turn 36 + k.\n\nWith y_{36} =0.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn 36 + m, y_{36+m}.\n\nWe want y_{36+m} =9 for some m, with minimal total H.\n\nH includes the actions from t=34.\n\nFrom t=34 to t=36, we have two actions: a_{34} and a_{35}, and we set y_{36}=0.\n\nThen from t=36, we take actions to reach y=9.\n\nLet M be the number of actions from t=36 to the turn before reaching y=9.\n\nAfter M actions starting from t=36, we reach y at turn 36 + M.\n\nSet y_{36 + M} =9.\n\nThen the total number of actions: from t=34 to t=34 + H -1.\n\ny_{34} at turn 34.\n\nAfter first action a_{34}, y_{35} at turn 35.\n\nAfter second action a_{35}, y_{36} at turn 36.\n\nThen after next actions, up to after a_{34 + H -1}, y_{34 + H} at turn 34+H.\n\nWe want y_{34+H} =9.\n\nAt turn 36, which is t=36, y_{36}=0.\n\nt=36 = 34 + 2, so after 2 actions, we are at turn 36 with y=0.\n\nThen from turn 36 to turn 34+H, the number of turns elapsed is (34+H) - 36 = H - 2.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 36 to turn (34+H) -1 = 34+H-1.\n\nActions at turns: 36, 37, ..., up to 34+H-1.\n\nThe first action after turn 36 is at turn 36, which sets y_{37}, last action at turn 34+H-1 sets y_{34+H}.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 36 to turn 34+H-1 inclusive: from 36 to 34+H-1, number is (34+H-1) - 36 +1 = 34+H-1-36+1 = H - 2.\n\nAfter K actions from turn 36, we are at turn 36 + K, with y_{36+K}.\n\nSet y_{36+K} =9.\n\nThen K is the number of actions from t=36.\n\nThen turn when reached: t=36+K.\n\nBut t=36+K = 34 + H, since y_{34+H}=9.\n\nSo 36 + K = 34 + H, thus H = K + 2.\n\nWe need min H, so min K, since H=K+2.\n\nK min is 9, if we go straight up from y=0 to y=9 in 9 up moves.\n\nBut we have to avoid the collision times at t=40,41,42.\n\nt=40,41,42 correspond to what in terms of K.\n\nAt turn t=36, y=0.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 36, y=0\n\nAfter a_{36}, turn 37, y set\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, turn 36+m, y set.\n\nTurn 40: t=40 = 36 + 4, so after 4 actions from t=36, we are at turn 40.\n\nSimilarly, t=41 =36+5, turn 41.\n\nt=42=36+6, turn 42.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T in 1-8, and 0 covered, collision.\n\nFor T=40,41,42, we need y_T not 7 and not 8, since freeway 7 and 8 covered.\n\nIf on other freeways, might be safe, but only if not covered.\n\nFor example, at T=40, freeway 1 to 6: are they covered?\n\nAt T=40, t1=34, Δt=6.\n\nFreeway 1: car at Δt=6: [-83 + 36*6, -48 + 36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168], min 133>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2,3 same, not covered.\n\nFreeway 4: [-71 +24*6, -48+24*6] = [-71+144, -48+144] = [73,96] >0, not covered.\n\nSimilarly 5,6.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 covered at T=40,41,42.\n\nSo at T=40,41,42, only freeway 7 and 8 are dangerous; other freeways are safe.\n\nTherefore, at turns 40,41,42, we must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nThat is, y_{40} !=7, y_{41} !=7, y_{42} !=7 and similarly for 8, but since we are on one y, we need to avoid y=7 and y=8 at those turns.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn, if we are on y=7 or 8 at that time, collision.\n\nNow, we start from t=36, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 with min K actions.\n\nIf we go straight up: actions all U, starting from turn 36.\n\nAfter a_{36}: U, y_{37}=1\n\nAt turn 37: y=1, freeway 1, which at t=37, not covered (as earlier, only t=36 covered), safe.\n\na_{37}: U, y_{38}=2\n\nTurn 38: y=2, freeway 2, at t=38, not covered, safe.\n\na_{38}: U, y_{39}=3\n\nTurn 39: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\na_{39}: U, y_{40}=4\n\nNow turn 40: y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nAt t=40, freeway 4 not covered, as above, so safe.\n\nBut we need to check y at t=40,41,42.\n\nHere y_{40}=4, not 7 or 8, so ok for t=40.\n\nContinue: a_{40}: U, y_{41}=5\n\nTurn 41: y=5, freeway 5, at t=41, not covered, safe. But y=5 !=7,8, so ok for collision avoidance.\n\na_{41}: U, y_{42}=6\n\nTurn 42: y=6, freeway 6, safe, and y=6 !=7,8.\n\na_{42}: U, y_{43}=7\n\nNow turn 43: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt t=43, what is coverage? t=43, Δt=43-34=9.\n\nFreeway 7: third car: [-35 +4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly other cars not cover, so freeway 7 safe at t=43.\n\na_{43}: U, y_{44}=8\n\nTurn 44: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nt=44, Δt=10, freeway 8: third car [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16]>0, not covered.\n\na_{44}: U, y_{45}=9\n\nTurn 45: y=9, not freeway.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at turn 45.\n\nBut we need to check the critical turns.\n\nAt t=40, y=4; t=41, y=5; t=42, y=6; all not 7 or 8, and on freeways that are not covered at those times, so no collision.\n\nIn this path, we avoided t=36 by being at y=0, and for t=40,41,42, we are at y=4,5,6, not 7 or 8.\n\nK=9 actions from t=36: actions at t=36 to t=44, 9 actions, y from 0 to 9 at t=45? Let's list turns.\n\nStart: t=36, y=0\n\nAction a_{36}: U, to y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: y=1\n\na_{37}: U, y_{38}=2\n\nt=38: y=2\n\na_{38}: U, y_{39}=3\n\nt=39: y=3\n\na_{39}: U, y_{40}=4\n\nt=40: y=4\n\na_{40}: U, y_{41}=5\n\nt=41: y=5\n\na_{41}: U, y_{42}=6\n\nt=42: y=6\n\na_{42}: U, y_{43}=7\n\nt=43: y=7\n\na_{43}: U, y_{44}=8\n\nt=44: y=8\n\na_{44}: U, y_{45}=9\n\nt=45: y=9\n\nReached at t=45.\n\nNow, from beginning: we have actions from t=34 and t=35 to set y_{36}=0.\n\nEarlier, we can do two options.\n\nOption 1: stay at y=0 for both turns.\n\na_{34}: S, y_{35}=0\n\na_{35}: S, y_{36}=0\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nOption 2: go up then down.\n\na_{34}: U, y_{35}=1\n\nAt t=35: y=1, freeway 1, not covered, safe.\n\na_{35}: D, y_{36}=0\n\nThen same.\n\nIn terms of H, for reaching y=9 at t=45, with 11 actions? Total actions.\n\nFrom t=34 to t=44 inclusive? Actions at t=34 to t=44, 11 actions? t=34 to t=44 is 11 turns? Turns: 34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44: that's 11 actions, y_{45}=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for H actions, ending at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nHere t1=34, after H actions, y_{34+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions at t=34 to t=44, that's t=34 to 44, 11 actions (t=0 to 10 relative? t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nIndices: t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe have y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with y_{45}=9, so t1 + H =45, t1=34, so 34+H=45, H=11.\n\nActions at t=34 to 44.\n\nBut we can do better? K=9 from t=36, but we need to include the first two actions.\n\nMinimal K=9, H=K+2=11.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by not going to y=0 at t=36.\n\nEarlier we thought y_{36} must be 0, because it can't be higher and must avoid 1-6.\n\nBut y_{36} max 2, min 0, and 1,2 are bad, so only 0.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at t=36.\n\nThus, cannot reach before t=45.\n\nBut t=45 is 34+11, H=11.\n\nNow, but in the path above, for t=40,41,42, we are at y=4,5,6, which is fine.\n\nBut we need to output the action sequence from t=34.\n\nFirst, we need to choose how to get to y_{36}=0.\n\nEither:\n\nSequence A: a_{34}=S, a_{35}=S, then y_{36}=0\n\nOr sequence B: a_{34}=U, a_{35}=D, then y_{35}=1, y_{36}=0\n\nIn terms of min H, same, both lead to y_{36}=0.\n\nThen from there, the up sequence.\n\nIn the up sequence from t=36, we used all U, reached at t=45.\n\nBut at t=43, y=7, freeway 7, but at t=43, not covered, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly t=44, y=8, freeway 8, not covered.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 7 and 8 covered at t=40,41,42, but we were not on them.\n\nIn this path, it works with H=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose from t=36, we go up faster, but we can only move one per turn.\n\nUnless we start from higher y, but at t=36, we are at y=0.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not staying, but we must be at y=0 at t=36.\n\nAnother idea: at t=36, y=0, but we can go up and reach before t=40 or after t=42, but to reach y=9, min turns from y=0 is 9, so at turn 36+9=45, same as above.\n\nTurn 36 to 45 is 9 turns later, but y set at each turn.\n\nFrom t=36 to t=45, with y=9 at t=45.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=44.\n\nBut t=45 is the turn when we arrive.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at an earlier turn, but from y=0 at t=36, earliest is t=45 with all U.\n\nt=36: y=0\n\nAfter 1 U: t=37, y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 U: t=45, y=9.\n\nYes, min.\n\nIf we do down or stay, it takes more turns.\n\nSo min H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision at t=40,41,42.\n\nIn the path, at t=40, y=4; t=41,y=5; t=42,y=6; all not 7 or 8, and freeways 4,5,6 not covered at those times, so safe.\n\nAt t=43,y=7, freeway 7, but at t=43, Δt=9, freeway 7: third car [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=44,y=8, freeway 8: same, [1,12] or whatever, not cover 0.\n\nt=44, Δt=10, freeway 8 third car: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16], not cover 0.\n\nNow, for the beginning, we need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, at t=40,41,42 covered, but we were not on them.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nFirst, from t=34 to t=35 to set y_{36}=0.\n\nWe can choose either way.\n\nTo minimize actions, both take two actions, but since we have to, no difference.\n\nPerhaps going up and down might be better if there were constraints, but here no.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nLet me pick going up then down.\n\nSo a_{34} = U\n\nThen at t=35, y=1, safe as established.\n\nThen a_{35} = D, y_{36}=0\n\nThen from t=36: all U up to y=9.\n\na_{36} to a_{44} all U.\n\nActions: t=36: U, to y=1? y_{37}=1\n\nList:\n\nTurn 34: a_{34} = U  // y_{35} = 0+1=1\n\nTurn 35: a_{35} = D  // y_{36} =1-1=0\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = U  // y_{37} =0+1=1\n\nTurn 37: a_{37} = U  // y_{38}=2\n\nTurn 38: a_{38} = U  // y_{39}=3\n\nTurn 39: a_{39} = U  // y_{40}=4\n\nTurn 40: a_{40} = U  // y_{41}=5\n\nTurn 41: a_{41} = U  // y_{42}=6\n\nTurn 42: a_{42} = U  // y_{43}=7\n\nTurn 43: a_{43} = U  // y_{44}=8\n\nTurn 44: a_{44} = U  // y_{45}=9\n\nNow, at turn 45, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=34 to t=44, that's 11 actions: t=34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nH=11.\n\nWith all S at start: a_{34}=S, a_{35}=S, then a_{36} to a_{44} U, same H.\n\nBut with U then D, we moved a bit, but same number.\n\nNow, but in the sequence above, at turn 42, y_{43}=7?

The minimal \\(H\\) is 11, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 45 (since \\(t_1 + H = 34 + 11 = 45\\)).\n\n### Key Constraints and Avoidance Strategy:\n- **Collision at turn 36**: Freeways 1 to 6 all have cars covering \\(x = 0\\) at turn 36. To avoid collision, the player must not be on any of these freeways (i.e., \\(y_{36} \\notin \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)). Given the movement constraints, \\(y_{36}\\) can only be 0, 1, or 2. Since \\(y_{36} = 1\\) or \\(2\\) causes collision, \\(y_{36}\\) must be 0. This requires actions at turns 34 and 35 to ensure \\(y_{36} = 0\\).\n- **Collisions at turns 40, 41, and 42**: Freeways 7 and 8 have cars covering \\(x = 0\\) at these turns. To avoid collision, the player must not be on freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\)) or freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\)) at turns 40, 41, and 42.\n- **Path to \\(y = 9\\)**: Starting from \\(y_{36} = 0\\), the player moves up (U) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) in 9 actions (turns 36 to 44), arriving at turn 45. At turns 40, 41, and 42, the player is at \\(y = 4\\), \\(y = 5\\), and \\(y = 6\\) respectively, avoiding freeways 7 and 8. All other freeways are safe at these times.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence consists of 11 actions (\\(H = 11\\)) from turn 34 to turn 44:\n- Turn 34: U (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 35). At turn 35, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) is safe as no car covers \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 35: D (move down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 36). This ensures \\(y_{36} = 0\\), avoiding collision at turn 36.\n- Turns 36 to 44: U (move up each turn). This sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45 without collisions:\n  - At turns 37-39: \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) on freeways 1-3, all safe as no cars cover \\(x = 0\\).\n  - At turns 40-42: \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) on freeways 4-6, all safe and avoiding freeways 7-8 during coverage.\n  - At turns 43-44: \\(y = 7, 8\\) on freeways 7-8, but no coverage at these turns, so safe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: D \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 36. The player starts at (0,0) and wants to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\n Important note: \n - The grid has vertical lanes y=0 (start) to y=9 (goal). The player moves vertically (U: +1, D: -1, S: 0) but note that the horizontal position is fixed at 0? Actually, the problem states that the player is at (0, y_t) and the cars are on freeways y=1 to 8. The collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) then we must avoid the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\n However, note the update: \n   - At turn T, the player is at y_T. \n   - Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway (so y_T between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that covers 0 at turn T.\n\n But note: the player is moving vertically and the cars are moving horizontally. The player is always at x=0? and the cars are on horizontal freeways (so they are at a fixed y, but moving in x). The collision happens when the player is at (0, y) and at the same time the car on freeway y has a span that includes x=0 at that turn.\n\n Also note: when moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is still on the old freeway (if moving up from y to y+1, then at turn T the player is at y, and at turn T+1 the player will be at y+1). So when moving, we are only concerned with the freeway we are currently on at the current turn.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We start at y0 = 0 (at turn 36). The goal is to get to y=9. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars) because cars are only on freeways y=1..8.\n\n 2. We must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) such that at each turn when the player is on a freeway y (1..8) we must ensure that no car on that freeway at that turn has a span that includes 0.\n\n 3. We are to minimize the number of turns H.\n\n Approach:\n Since we start at 0 and must get to 9, we need to go up at least 9 times. We can also go down or stay, but that would increase H. So ideally we would like to go up 9 times without any down. However, we must avoid collisions.\n\n But note: we can also wait (S) or even go down to avoid a collision and then go up again.\n\n How to model the cars?\n For each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we are given:\n   - initial head, tail, direction, speed at turn t1=36.\n\n For a future turn T (relative to t1: T_abs = 36 + t, where t>=0), the car's span becomes:\n\n   If direction is right: \n        head(T) = head0 + s * (T_abs - 36) = head0 + s * t\n        tail(T) = tail0 + s * t\n        So the span is [tail0 + s*t, head0 + s*t] (and note that head0>=tail0 because in the table for right we have (head0, tail0) and in the table we see (56,45) so head0>tail0).\n\n   If direction is left: \n        head(T) = head0 - s * t\n        tail(T) = tail0 - s * t\n        and the span is [head0 - s*t, tail0 - s*t] but note: in the table we don't have any left? Actually, the given cars are all right.\n\n Looking at the table, all cars are right-moving.\n\n So for freeways 1 to 8:\n\n Freeway 1: one car: (h0=24, tau0=-11, d=right, s=36) -> at time t (after 36) the span is:\n      [ -11 + 36*t, 24 + 36*t ]\n\n Freeway 2: same as freeway 1: [ -11 + 36*t, 24 + 36*t ]\n\n Freeway 3: same: [ -11 + 36*t, 24 + 36*t ]\n\n Freeway 4: (h0=0, tau0=-23, d=right, s=24) -> [ -23 + 24*t, 0 + 24*t ]\n\n Freeway 5: same as 4: [ -23 + 24*t, 0 + 24*t ]\n\n Freeway 6: same: [ -23 + 24*t, 0 + 24*t ]\n\n Freeway 7: three cars? \n     Car1: (56,45,right,4) -> [45+4*t, 56+4*t]\n     Car2: (20,9,right,4) -> [9+4*t, 20+4*t]\n     Car3: (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27+4*t, -16+4*t]\n\n Freeway 8: same as 7: \n     Car1: [45+4*t,56+4*t]\n     Car2: [9+4*t,20+4*t]\n     Car3: [-27+4*t,-16+4*t]\n\n Note: collision on freeway k at turn T (absolute turn = 36+t) happens if the player is at freeway k at that turn and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\n However, note: if there are multiple cars, we need to check if 0 is in any of the spans.\n\n Since the player must avoid being on freeway k at turn T if any car on k has a span that includes 0.\n\n How to check for a particular freeway k and turn T (with t = T_abs - 36 = T - 36) whether 0 is covered?\n\n Example for freeway 1 at turn T (t = T-36):\n   The car spans: [ -11 + 36*t, 24 + 36*t ]\n   We require 0 in [ -11+36*t, 24+36*t ] \n   =>  -11+36*t <= 0 <= 24+36*t\n\n   Since t>=0, the right bound is always positive? But let's solve:\n        -11+36*t <= 0  => t <= 11/36 (about 0.305) -> so only for t=0? \n        and 0<=24+36*t -> always true for t>=0.\n\n   So for t=0 (turn 36): \n        -11 <= 0 <= 24 -> true -> so at turn 36, if the player is on freeway1, then collision.\n\n   For t=1 (turn 37): \n        -11+36 = 25 >0 -> so 0 is not in [25, 60] -> safe.\n\n   Therefore, freeway1 is unsafe only at t=0? Actually, t=0 is the initial turn. But note: at turn 36, the player is at y=0, not on freeway1. So we don't care about freeway1 at turn36 for the player.\n\n Similarly, freeway2 and 3 are the same: unsafe only at t=0? But again, at turn36 the player is at y=0.\n\n Now freeway4: [ -23+24*t, 0+24*t ]\n   Check 0 in [ -23+24*t, 24*t ]:\n        -23+24*t <= 0 <= 24*t\n        => two conditions:\n           -23+24*t <= 0 -> t <= 23/24 (about 0.958) -> so for t=0: -23<=0<=0 -> true? \n                0<=24*t -> for t=0: 0<=0 -> true -> so at t=0, 0 is in the span? But note: the span at t=0 is [-23,0]. 0 is included.\n\n        for t=1: [1,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n   So freeway4: unsafe at t=0? (turn36) -> but again, at turn36 the player is at y=0.\n\n   However, if the player is on freeway4 at turn T (with t = T-36) and t=0, then collision. But t=0 corresponds to turn36. At turn36, the player is at y=0. So when will the player be on freeway4? At a turn when the player has moved to y=4.\n\n   We need to consider the future turns when the player might be on these freeways.\n\n Let me denote the absolute turn by T (starting at T0=36). The relative time t = T - 36.\n\n The player's y at turn T (starting at T0=36) is determined by the actions from T0 to T-1? Actually, note:\n\n   At turn T0: y = 0.\n   Then we choose a_{T0} and then at turn T0+1 we have y_{T0+1} = y_{T0} + a_{T0} (with a in {U: +1, D: -1, S:0}).\n\n   So at turn T (>=T0), the player's y is the sum of the actions from T0 to T-1? Actually:\n\n        y_{T0} = 0\n        y_{T0+1} = 0 + a_{T0}\n        y_{T0+2} = y_{T0+1} + a_{T0+1} = a_{T0} + a_{T0+1}\n        ... \n        y_{T0+k} = a_{T0} + ... + a_{T0+k-1}\n\n   And each action a_t is either +1, -1, or 0.\n\n We require y_{T0+H-1} = 9.\n\n We are to find the minimal H and a sequence of H actions (from T0 to T0+H-1) such that:\n\n   For every T in [T0, T0+H-1]:\n        if y_T is in {1,2,...,8}, then at that turn T, no car on freeway y_T has a span that includes 0.\n\n How to compute the state of the cars at any turn T? We have the initial state at T0=36 and then the relative time t = T - 36.\n\n We'll compute for each freeway and for each car the span at relative time t.\n\n Since we want minimal H, we try to go up as much as possible. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\n Let me try to simulate:\n\n We start at turn36: y=0 (safe) -> we can choose U, D, or S.\n\n We want to get to 9. Minimal H would be 9 if we can go straight up without being hit.\n\n What happens if we try to go straight up?\n\n   Turn36: y=0 -> safe (not on freeway). We choose U -> then at turn37: y=1.\n\n   Now at turn37: we are on freeway1. We need to check freeway1 at turn37 (t=1):\n\n        freeway1: [ -11+36*1, 24+36*1 ] = [25, 60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So we can choose U again -> turn38: y=2.\n\n   Turn38: freeway2 at t=2: [ -11+36*2, 24+36*2 ] = [61,96] -> safe.\n\n        U -> turn39: y=3.\n\n   Turn39: freeway3: same as above: [ -11+36*3, 24+36*3] = [97,132] -> safe.\n\n        U -> turn40: y=4.\n\n   Turn40: freeway4: at t=4 (since T0=36, then t=40-36=4) -> [ -23+24*4, 0+24*4] = [ -23+96, 96] = [73,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        U -> turn41: y=5.\n\n   Turn41: freeway5: same as freeway4? -> [ -23+24*5, 24*5] = [ -23+120, 120] = [97,120] -> safe.\n\n        U -> turn42: y=6.\n\n   Turn42: freeway6: [ -23+24*6, 24*6] = [121,144] -> safe.\n\n        U -> turn43: y=7.\n\n   Turn43: freeway7: we have three cars. We must check each:\n\n        Car1: [45+4*(43-36)=45+4*7=45+28=73, 56+28=84] -> [73,84] -> 0 not in.\n        Car2: [9+4*7=9+28=37, 20+28=48] -> [37,48] -> safe.\n        Car3: [-27+28=1, -16+28=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in? but 0 is less than 1 -> safe.\n\n        Actually, [1,12] does not contain 0? -> safe.\n\n        So U -> turn44: y=8.\n\n   Turn44: freeway8: same as freeway7 at t=8? Actually, t=44-36=8.\n\n        Car1: [45+4*8=45+32=77,56+32=88] -> safe.\n        Car2: [9+32=41,20+32=52] -> safe.\n        Car3: [-27+32=5, -16+32=16] -> [5,16] -> safe.\n\n        Then U -> turn45: y=9 -> goal.\n\n   So H = 9? (from turn36 to turn44: 9 actions? Let's count: \n        turn36: action U -> leads to y=1 at turn37\n        turn37: U -> y=2 at turn38\n        ...\n        turn44: U -> y=9 at turn45.\n\n        So we use 9 actions: from turn36 to turn44 (inclusive) -> 9 turns? Actually, the number of actions is 9 and we reach at turn45, which is the 10th state? \n\n   But note: the problem says: we are at turn t1=36, and we are to provide actions for t1, t1+1, ... until the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at (0,9). \n\n   Therefore, H is the number of actions. And we have:\n\n        At turn36: we are at (0,0) and we take the first action.\n\n        After H actions, we have taken actions at turns: 36, 37, ..., 36+H-1.\n\n        Then at turn36+H, we have the new state: y_{36+H} = 0 + (sum of actions) = 9.\n\n   So in this plan, we have H=9: we do 9 U's and at turn45 (which is 36+9) we are at y=9.\n\n   And we checked that at every intermediate turn (when we were on freeways 1 to 8) we were safe.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n But wait: at turn36, we are at y=0 and we take U -> then at turn37 we are at y=1. We checked freeway1 at turn37 (t=1) and it was safe.\n\n However, let me double-check freeway7 and freeway8 at the times we pass:\n\n   At turn43 (y=7): t=43-36=7.\n        freeway7:\n          Car1: [45+4*7=73,56+28=84] -> [73,84] -> safe.\n          Car2: [9+28=37,20+28=48] -> safe.\n          Car3: [-27+28=1, -16+28=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n   At turn44 (y=8): t=8.\n        freeway8:\n          Car1: [45+32=77,56+32=88] -> safe.\n          Car2: [9+32=41,20+32=52] -> safe.\n          Car3: [-27+32=5, -16+32=16] -> safe.\n\n   So it seems safe.\n\n However, wait: the car3 on freeway7 at turn43: [1,12] -> does this include 0? No, because 1>0.\n\n But note: the problem says the car spans are continuous intervals. So [1,12] is from 1 to 12 and 0 is not in.\n\n Therefore, the sequence is 9 consecutive U moves.\n\n But the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So when we are at turn T and we are at y_T, we are only concerned with the freeway at y_T at turn T.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   Turn36: U -> then at turn37: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe? yes, because at turn37 the car on freeway1 is at [25,60] and 0 not in.\n   Turn37: U -> turn38: y=2 -> freeway2: same as freeway1 at t=2: [61,96] -> safe.\n   Turn38: U -> turn39: y=3 -> freeway3: [97,132] -> safe.\n   Turn39: U -> turn40: y=4 -> freeway4: [ -23+24*(40-36)= -23+24*4= -23+96=73, 24*4=96] -> [73,96] -> safe.\n   Turn40: U -> turn41: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4 at t=5: [ -23+24*5= -23+120=97, 120] -> safe.\n   Turn41: U -> turn42: y=6 -> freeway6: [ -23+24*6= -23+144=121, 144] -> safe.\n   Turn42: U -> turn43: y=7 -> freeway7: as above -> safe.\n   Turn43: U -> turn44: y=8 -> freeway8: as above -> safe.\n   Turn44: U -> turn45: y=9 -> goal.\n\n So we do 9 actions: from turn36 to turn44.\n\n But note: the problem says the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1? Actually, the sequence is for t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\n Therefore:\n\n   Turn 36: U\n   Turn 37: U\n   Turn 38: U\n   Turn 39: U\n   Turn 40: U\n   Turn 41: U\n   Turn 42: U\n   Turn 43: U\n   Turn 44: U\n\n However, wait: at turn44 we take the last U and then at turn45 we are at 9. So we have done 9 moves.\n\n But let me check if at any turn we are on a freeway that has a collision. We did the calculations and it seems safe.\n\n However, I notice: freeway4,5,6: the initial state at turn36: \n        freeway4: [ -23, 0] -> so at turn36, if we were on freeway4, we would be hit because 0 is in the span. But we are not on freeway4 at turn36.\n\n But what about when we are on freeway4 at turn40? That's 4 turns after, so t=4: [ -23+24*4, 24*4] = [73,96] -> 0 not in.\n\n Similarly, freeway7 at turn36: \n        Car1: [45,56] -> 0 not in? \n        Car2: [9,20] -> 0 not in? \n        Car3: [-27,-16] -> 0 not in? -> but note: [-27,-16] is negative, so 0 is not in that interval.\n\n        Actually, at turn36 (t=0) for freeway7:\n            Car1: [45,56] -> 0 not in.\n            Car2: [9,20] -> 0 not in.\n            Car3: [-27,-16] -> 0 not in.\n\n        So freeway7 at turn36 is safe? But we are not on it at turn36.\n\n        However, if we were to be on freeway7 at turn36, we would be safe? \n\n        But note: the problem says collision occurs only if 0 is in the span. So if the player is at (0,7) at turn36, then we check if 0 is in any of the spans. Since none of the spans at turn36 on freeway7 contain 0, it would be safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway8 at turn36: same as freeway7? -> safe.\n\n But what about freeway4 at turn36: [ -23,0] -> 0 is included? So if we were on freeway4 at turn36, we would be hit.\n\n However, we are at turn36 at y=0.\n\n Now, what if we had to wait at some point? We don't need to because we found a path in 9 moves.\n\n But is there a problem with freeway7 or freeway8 at an earlier time? \n\n   For example, at turn37: if we had gone to freeway7 at turn37 (which we don't in the straight up plan) we would check freeway7 at turn37 (t=1):\n        Car1: [45+4=49,56+4=60] -> safe.\n        Car2: [9+4=13,20+4=24] -> safe.\n        Car3: [-27+4=-23, -16+4=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n   But we are at freeway1 at turn37.\n\n However, let me check freeway4 at turn37 (t=1): \n        [ -23+24*1, 24*1] = [1,24] -> safe.\n\n   freeway5 at turn37: same -> safe.\n\n   freeway6 at turn37: same -> safe.\n\n   So even if we were to move slower, we might be safe? But we don't need to.\n\n But wait: what about freeway4 at turn36: unsafe? But we are not there.\n\n However, note that in our plan we are at freeway4 at turn40 (t=4) -> safe.\n\n But what if we try to be at freeway4 earlier? For example, if we had taken 4 U's by turn39? Then at turn39 we would be at freeway4? \n\n   turn36: U -> turn37: y=1 (freeway1: safe at t=1)\n   turn37: U -> turn38: y=2 (freeway2: safe at t=2)\n   turn38: U -> turn39: y=3 (freeway3: safe at t=3)\n   turn39: U -> turn40: y=4 (freeway4: t=4 -> safe)\n\n   But if we had taken only 3 moves? Then at turn39 we are at y=3? So we are not at freeway4 until turn40.\n\n   Alternatively, if we take 4 moves by turn39? Then at turn39 we are at y=4? \n\n        At turn39: we are at freeway4 -> t=39-36=3 -> freeway4: [ -23+24*3, 24*3] = [ -23+72, 72] = [49,72] -> safe? \n\n        Actually, we could have arrived at freeway4 at turn39? \n\n        How? \n          turn36: U -> y=1 at turn37\n          turn37: U -> y=2 at turn38\n          turn38: U -> y=3 at turn39\n          turn39: U -> y=4 at turn40 -> so we are at freeway4 at turn40.\n\n        To be at freeway4 at turn39, we would have to be at y=4 at turn39. But that would require 4 moves in 3 actions? \n\n        Actually, the state at turn T is after the action of turn T-1? \n\n        We start at turn36: y=0.\n        After action at turn36: y at turn37 = 0 + a36.\n        After action at turn37: y at turn38 = a36 + a37.\n        After action at turn38: y at turn39 = a36+a37+a38.\n\n        We require a36+a37+a38 = 4? and each is at most 1? Then minimum 4 actions? But we have only 3 actions? \n\n        So we cannot be at y=4 at turn39. The earliest we can be at y=4 is at turn40 (after 4 actions: turn36 to turn39 -> 4 actions? and then at turn40 we are at y=4).\n\n        Actually: \n          turn36: U -> turn37: y=1\n          turn37: U -> turn38: y=2\n          turn38: U -> turn39: y=3\n          turn39: U -> turn40: y=4\n\n        So we are at freeway4 at turn40 (when we have taken 4 actions) and that corresponds to t=40-36=4.\n\n        And we computed: [73,96] -> safe.\n\n        Alternatively, if we take an extra U at the beginning? We cannot because we start at 0 and we can only do one action per turn.\n\n Therefore, the straight up plan is safe.\n\n But wait: what about freeway4 at turn36? It's unsafe, but we are not there at turn36. We are there at turn40, and then it's safe.\n\n However, I see that freeway4 at turn36: [ -23,0] -> unsafe. But that doesn't affect us because we are at y=0 at turn36.\n\n But note: if we were to go to freeway4 at turn36, we cannot because we start at y=0 and we can only move one per turn.\n\n So the plan is valid.\n\n However, let me check freeway7 and freeway8 at the times we pass again to be sure.\n\n   At turn43: y=7 -> freeway7 at t=7 (43-36=7)\n        Car3: [-27+4*7, -16+4*7] = [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12] -> does this include 0? No.\n\n        But note: the car3 span at t=7 is [1,12] and 0 is not in. So safe.\n\n   At turn44: y=8 -> freeway8 at t=8: \n        Car3: [-27+4*8, -16+4*8] = [-27+32, -16+32] = [5,16] -> safe.\n\n   However, what if we look at freeway7 at an earlier time? For example, at turn36 (t=0): \n        Car3: [-27,-16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        But at turn37: freeway7: \n            Car3: [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n        At turn38: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n        At turn39: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n        At turn40: [-11,0] -> wait, at turn40: freeway7: Car3: [-11,0] -> does this include 0? Yes, because -11<=0<=0? \n\n        But note: at turn40, we are at freeway4, not freeway7. So we don't care.\n\n        However, what if we were at freeway7 at turn40? Then we would have a collision? But we are not.\n\n        Similarly, at turn41: freeway7: Car3: [-27+4*5, -16+4*5] = [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4] -> this does include 0? because -7<=0<=4 -> yes.\n\n        So if the player is on freeway7 at turn41, then collision.\n\n        But in our plan, we are at freeway7 at turn43, not at turn41.\n\n        Similarly, freeway8 at turn41: same as freeway7? -> so freeway8 at turn41: Car3: [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n\n        But we are at freeway5 at turn41: safe (freeway5 at t=5: [97,120] -> safe).\n\n        So the danger at freeway7 and freeway8 at turn41 is not a problem for us.\n\n Therefore, the straight up plan is safe.\n\n But wait: what about freeway4 at turn36: unsafe? But we are not there.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: if we ever are at freeway4 at a time when t is such that the span contains 0? \n\n   We are at freeway4 at turn40 (t=4): [73,96] -> safe.\n\n   But what if we had to wait? For example, if we had taken more turns? \n\n   In our plan we are only at freeway4 at turn40. \n\n   However, let me check freeway4 at other times:\n\n        Condition: 0 in [ -23+24*t, 24*t] \n        => -23+24*t <= 0 <= 24*t\n        => 0 <= 23/24? -> t must be an integer? \n\n        For t=0: true -> unsafe at turn36.\n        For t=1: [1,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        For t>=1: the left bound is at least 1 -> safe.\n\n        So freeway4 is unsafe only at t=0 (turn36).\n\n   Similarly, freeway1,2,3: unsafe only at t=0? \n\n        Condition: 0 in [ -11+36*t, 24+36*t] \n        => -11+36*t <=0 <=24+36*t\n\n        The second inequality is always true for t>=0.\n\n        The first: 36*t <=11 -> t<=11/36 -> only t=0.\n\n        So freeway1,2,3 are unsafe only at turn36.\n\n   Therefore, the only danger is if we are on freeway1,2,3,4 at turn36. But we are at y=0 at turn36.\n\n   Then for freeways 5,6: same as freeway4? \n\n        freeway5: same as freeway4: [ -23+24*t, 24*t] -> unsafe only at t=0.\n\n   freeway6: same.\n\n   freeway7 and freeway8: we have to be careful at multiple times? \n\n        For freeway7 (and similarly freeway8) we have three cars.\n\n        We need to find t such that 0 is in at least one of the spans:\n\n          Car1: [45+4*t, 56+4*t] -> 45+4*t <=0? -> no, because 45+4*t>=45>0 -> never unsafe.\n\n          Car2: [9+4*t,20+4*t] -> 9+4*t>=9>0 -> never unsafe.\n\n          Car3: [-27+4*t, -16+4*t] \n                 We require: -27+4*t <=0 and 0<=-16+4*t? \n                 Actually, the condition for being in the interval: \n                    -27+4*t <= 0 <= -16+4*t\n\n                 => \n                    -27+4*t <=0 -> t<=27/4=6.75\n                    0<=-16+4*t -> t>=4.\n\n                 So for t in {4,5,6}? \n\n                 Check:\n                   t=4: [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? -> unsafe.\n                   t=5: [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4] -> 0 included? -> unsafe.\n                   t=6: [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n                 t=7: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          Therefore, freeway7 is unsafe at t=4,5,6 (which correspond to turns 40,41,42).\n\n        Similarly, freeway8: same as freeway7 -> unsafe at t=4,5,6 (turns40,41,42).\n\n        So if the player is on freeway7 or freeway8 at turns40,41,42, then collision.\n\n        But in our straight up plan:\n\n            turn40: we are at freeway4 -> safe.\n            turn41: freeway5 -> safe.\n            turn42: freeway6 -> safe.\n            turn43: freeway7 -> t=7 -> safe (because t=7>6) \n            turn44: freeway8 -> t=8 -> safe.\n\n        So we avoid the unsafe times for freeway7 and freeway8.\n\n        Therefore, the straight up plan is safe.\n\n But what if we had taken an extra move? For example, if we had taken an extra stay at some point? Then we might be at freeway7 at turn42? \n\n        For example, if we do:\n\n          turn36: U -> y=1 at turn37\n          turn37: U -> y=2 at turn38\n          turn38: U -> y=3 at turn39\n          turn39: S -> y=3 at turn40\n          turn40: U -> y=4 at turn41\n          ... \n\n        Then at turn40: we are at freeway3? (y=3) -> safe? \n                freeway3 at t=40-36=4: [ -11+36*4, 24+36*4] = [133, 168] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn41: freeway4: t=5: [ -23+24*5, 24*5] = [97,120] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn42: freeway5: [ -23+24*6, 24*6] = [121,144] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn43: freeway6: [ -23+24*7, 24*7] = [145,168] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn44: freeway7: t=8 -> freeway7: \n                Car3: [-27+32, -16+32] = [5,16] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn45: freeway8: t=9: \n                Car3: [-27+36, -16+36] = [9,20] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn46: U -> y=9.\n\n        But this takes 10 actions (from turn36 to turn45) -> H=10, which is worse than 9.\n\n        So we stick to 9.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 9 and the sequence is 9 U's.\n\n But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found 9.\n\n However, let me check if we can do it in less? \n\n   We start at y=0 and need to get to y=9. Each U moves one up. We must have at least 9 U moves. So minimal H is 9.\n\n   And we found a plan with H=9.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\n\n But wait: at turn44 we take the last U and then at turn45 we are at 9. \n\n However, the problem says: we are to provide the actions until the last action that leads to the goal. So the last action is at turn44.\n\n But note: the goal is reached at the next state (turn45). \n\n The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions we are at (0,9). \n\n So we have H=9 actions: at turns 36,37,...,44.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\n}\n\n But note: the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we are to start with t1.\n\n However, I see a potential issue: at turn36 we are at y=0 and we do U -> then at turn37 we are at y=1. \n\n But at turn36, we are at y=0 (safe) and we do U -> then we are not on any freeway at turn36? Actually, we are always at the position at the beginning of the turn? \n\n The problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". \n\n So when we take an action at turn T, we are still at y_T during the entire turn T. Then after the action, at the next turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}.\n\n Therefore, during turn36 we are at y=0 (safe) and we take action U. Then at turn37, we are at y=1 -> then we check freeway1 at turn37.\n\n And we already checked that freeway1 at turn37 is safe.\n\n So it's okay.\n\n But what about the cars? We have computed the car positions at the turn we are on the freeway.\n\n Therefore, the plan is safe.\n\n Final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\) is 9.

The current turn is t1=38, and I start at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with their positions and speeds. The cars move either left or right, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision occurs only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn, so I don't collide at the turn I move.\n\nThe player position updates based on action: U for up, D for down, S for stay. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=2 at t=38.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 7, since from y=2 to y=9 is 7 steps up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could be more.\n\nBut let's see the car states.\n\nFirst, freeways 1,2,3 have the same car: (-48,-83, right, 36). Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] where t1=38.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nHere, h=-48, τ=-83, s=36, direction right.\n\nBut h and τ: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is the left end, h is the right end? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the initial state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head is to the right, tail to the left, so Span should be from tail to head, increasing x.\n\nIn the notation: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, so τ is left, h is right.\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it would be opposite.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving except possibly on freeway 7 and 8, but 7 and 8 have right direction.\n\nAll cars in this state are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSo at time t1=38, Span = [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-83 + 36(T-38), -48 + 36(T-38)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same thing.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: (48,25,right,24) head h=48, tail τ=25? That can't be right because tail should be left of head for right-moving.\n\nHead h=48, tail τ=25, but 25 < 48, so tail at 25, head at 48, so Span at t1: [25,48]? But direction right, so yes, [τ, h] = [25,48]\n\nThen Span(T) = [25 + 24(T-38), 48 + 24(T-38)]\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nFor each, right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, so since right-moving, tail τ should be left, head right. τ=-59, h=-48, so -59 < -48, so Span at t1: [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: h=28, τ=17, so [17,28]\n\nThird car: h=-8, τ=-19, so [-19,-8]\n\nAll with speed 4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, I need to be at y_T at turn T, and for that freeway, no car should have 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I start at t=38, y=2, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, and I need to avoid them when cars are at x=0.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no cars there. The freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe havens.\n\nThe player position is at (0,y), and y=0 to 9, but freeways only at y=1 to 8, so when at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nI start at y=2, which is freeway 2, so I need to check if at t=38, on freeway 2, is there a car with 0 in span?\n\nFreeway 2 at t=38: cars: only one car, span [-83 +36(0), -48 +36(0)] = [-83,-48] at T=t1, so 0 not in [-83,-48], so safe to start.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I just need to get there.\n\nBut I have to go through y=3 to 8, each might have cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car at x=0.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, at turn T, is 0 in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but only discrete turns matter.\n\nT is integer turn.\n\nt1=38, so let τ = T - 38, the offset in turns.\n\nFor freeway k=1: car span at T: [ -83 + 36τ, -48 + 36τ ] where τ = T - 38\n\n0 in span if -83 +36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +36τ\n\nBut -83 +36τ ≤ 0 implies τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ ≤ 2 since τ integer\n\n0 ≤ -48 +36τ implies τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ ≥ 2 since τ integer\n\nτ ≥ 2 and τ ≤ 2, so only τ=2\n\n-83 +36τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +36τ\n\nFirst inequality: -83 +36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36τ ≤ 83 ⇒ τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +36τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 36τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ ≥ 2\n\nThus for τ=2, which is T=38+2=40\n\nAt T=40, 0 in [ -83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24]? -83+72= -11, -48+72=24, so [-11,24], 0 is in this, yes.\n\nFor other τ, not.\n\nτ=1: [ -83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nτ=3: [ -83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car at x=0 only at T=40.\n\nSimilarly, since freeway 2 and 3 have same car, same thing: at T=40, unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 4,5,6: car (48,25,right,24), so h=48, τ=25, s=24\n\nSpan at T: [25 +24τ, 48 +24τ] where τ=T-38\n\n0 in span if 25+24τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48+24τ\n\nBut 25+24τ ≤ 0? 24τ ≤ -25, τ ≤ -25/24 ≈ -1.041, but τ ≥0 since T≥38, so impossible. Similarly, 0 ≤ 48+24τ always true for τ≥0, but since 25+24τ >0 for τ≥0, 0 not ≤ left end, so 0 never in span for τ≥0.\n\n25+24τ ≥25>0 for all τ≥0, so left end >0, thus 0 not in [left, right] since left>0. Similarly, for all future T, the car is always to the right, never at x=0. So freeways 4,5,6 are always safe? At t1, span [25,48], all positive, and moving right, so yes, x=0 never covered. So no car at x=0 for freeways 4,5,6 at any time.\n\nIs that right? [25 +24τ, 48+24τ], for τ=0, [25,48], min x=25>0; as τ increases, min x increases, so yes, always x≥25>0, so never at x=0. So freeways 4,5,6 are safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) so h=-48, τ=-59? Tail τ=-59, head h=-48, so span at T: [ -59 +4τ, -48 +4τ ]\n\n0 in span if -59+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48+4τ\n\nFirst: -59+4τ ≤0 ⇒ 4τ ≤59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/4=14.75, so τ≤14\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48+4τ ⇒ 48 ≤4τ ⇒ τ ≥12\n\nSo for τ from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nτ=12: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 in [-11,0]? -11 ≤0≤0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=12, T=38+12=50, span [-11,0], so 0 is the right end, included.\n\nτ=13: [ -59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nτ=14: [ -59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in, yes.\n\nτ=15: [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=50,51,52.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (28,17,right,4) h=28, τ=17, span [17+4τ, 28+4τ]\n\n17+4τ >0 for τ≥0, so never ≤0, always positive, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-8,-19,right,4) h=-8, τ=-19, span [ -19+4τ, -8+4τ ]\n\n0 in span if -19+4τ ≤0 ≤ -8+4τ\n\nFirst: -19+4τ ≤0 ⇒ 4τ≤19 ⇒ τ≤19/4=4.75, τ≤4\n\nSecond: 0≤ -8+4τ ⇒ 8≤4τ ⇒ τ≥2\n\nSo τ=2,3,4\n\nτ=2: [ -19+8, -8+8] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=3: [ -19+12, -8+12] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=4: [ -19+16, -8+16] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=5: [ -19+20, -8+20] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=40,41,42.\n\nT=38+τ, τ=2 is T=40, τ=3 T=41, τ=4 T=42.\n\nNow for freeway 7, it is unsafe if any car has 0 in span.\n\nSo from above:\n\nFirst car unsafe at T=50,51,52\n\nSecond car never unsafe\n\nThird car unsafe at T=40,41,42\n\nAlso, at other times, might be safe, but we have the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=43 to 49, no car has 0? Let's see.\n\nFor first car, unsafe only τ=12,13,14 i.e. T=50,51,52\n\nThird car unsafe T=40,41,42\n\nSecond car never.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe at T=40,41,42,50,51,52\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has same cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4), so same as freeway 7, unsafe at T=40,41,42,50,51,52.\n\nNow freeway 1,2,3 unsafe only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nI am at y=2 at t=38.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is unsafe only at T=40.\n\nAt t=38, I am at y=2, and it is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: go up from y=2 to y=9, which takes 7 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 at t=38+7=45? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, then position at next turn.\n\nStart: turn t=38, position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{38}, at turn t=39, y_{39} = y_{38} + Δy_{38}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{39}, at t=40, y_{40} = y_{39} + Δy_{39}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning that at turn T, I am at (0,9).\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nThe turns when I am on intermediate freeways must be safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=2 to y=9, I need to increase y by 7, so with only U actions, I can be at y=9 at turn t=38+7=45.\n\nt=38: start y=2\n\nAfter a_{38}, at t=39: y=2 + Δy, if a=U, y=3; D y=1; S y=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf I do U at each step, starting from t=38:\n\n- t=38: action U, then at t=39, y=3\n\n- t=39: action U, at t=40, y=4\n\n- t=40: action U, at t=41, y=5\n\n- t=41: action U, at t=42, y=6\n\n- t=42: action U, at t=43, y=7\n\n- t=43: action U, at t=44, y=8\n\n- t=44: action U, at t=45, y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, when I am on a freeway, I need to check safety.\n\nAt turn t=39: I am at y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe only at T=40? But at t=39, T=39.\n\nFreeway 3: car same as freeway 1,2.\n\nAt T=39, τ=1, span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt turn t=40: I am at y=4? In the sequence above, at t=40, I am at y=4? Let's see positions.\n\nAt turn t=38: position y=2\n\nAfter action at t=38: U, so at turn t=39, position y=3\n\nAfter action at t=39: U, so at turn t=40, position y=4\n\nNow at turn t=40, I am on freeway y=4.\n\nFreeway y=4 is freeway 4, which we said is always safe, since no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=41: position y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nt=42: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=43: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt t=43, T=43, which is safe for freeway 7? Earlier, freeway 7 unsafe at T=40,41,42,50,51,52.\n\nT=43 is not in that, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=44: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=40,41,42,50,51,52, T=44 not in, safe.\n\nThen t=45: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=39 to t=44, I am on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nt=39: y=3, freeway 3, safe at T=39.\n\nt=40: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=41: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nt=42: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=43: y=7, freeway 7, T=43, not unsafe, safe.\n\nt=44: y=8, freeway 8, T=44, not unsafe, safe.\n\nAll seem safe. And I reach y=9 at t=45.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=40 or something?\n\nAt t=40, I am on y=4, which is freeway 4, safe.\n\nBut freeway 2 and 3 are unsafe at t=40, but I am not on them at t=40.\n\nAt t=40, I am on y=4, freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 are unsafe at t=40,41,42, but at t=40, I am on y=4, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nAt t=41, I am on y=5, not y=7 or 8.\n\nAt t=42, I am on y=6, not y=7 or 8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIn this sequence, I never am on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=40: unsafe freeways are y=1,2,3 (since T=40), and y=7,8 (T=40)\n\nBut I am on y=4, safe.\n\nt=41: unsafe y=7,8 (T=41), I am on y=5, safe.\n\nt=42: unsafe y=7,8 (T=42), I am on y=6, safe.\n\nt=43: I am on y=7, but T=43, not unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nSo with 7 up actions, I can reach in 7 turns, from t=38 to t=45? Number of actions: from t=38 to t=45 is 7 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart at t=38, position y=2.\n\nAfter first action (t=38), at t=39, y=3\n\nAfter second action (t=39), at t=40, y=4\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action, at t=38+k, position y=2 + k, if all U.\n\nTo be at y=9, 2 + k =9, k=7, so at t=38+7=45, y=9.\n\nActions from t=38 to t=44, 7 actions.\n\nThe sequence: actions at t=38,39,40,41,42,43,44 all U, leading to positions at t=39 to t=45.\n\nAt each position from t=39 to t=44, I am on freeways y=3 to 8, and as above, all safe at those times.\n\nt=39: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nt=40: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nt=41: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nt=42: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=43: y=7, freeway 7, T=43, not unsafe (unsafe at 40,41,42,50-52), safe\n\nt=44: y=8, freeway 8, T=44, not unsafe, safe\n\nt=45: y=9, safe.\n\nSo minimal H should be 7, with all U actions.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if I go slower, it might take more turns.\n\nOr if I go down, but that would increase H.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 at t=43.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=43, τ=T-38=5\n\nFirst car: span [ -59 +4*5, -48 +4*5] = [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39,-28], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [17+20, 28+20] = [37,48], 0 not.\n\nThird car: [-19+20, -8+20] = [1,12], 0 not.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8 at t=44, τ=6\n\nFirst car: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], no\n\nSecond: [17+24,28+24]=[41,52], no\n\nThird: [-19+24,-8+24]=[5,16], no\n\nSafe.\n\nAnd at t=40,41,42, when y=7 and 8 are unsafe, I am not on them; I am on y=4,5,6 which are safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I need to output the actions starting from t_1=38.\n\nSo for t=38 to t=44, all U.\n\nH=7 turns, actions at t=38 to t=44.\n\nThe sequence: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nup to Turn t_1 +6: a_{t_1+6} = U\n\nt_1=38, so actions at t=38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, H=7, so t from 0 to 6.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 6.\n\nSo a_{38} to a_{44}, all U.\n\nThen at t=45, position (0,9).\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 steps, since each U increases by 1, so H=7 is minimum possible, I think, unless I can jump, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nS or D would keep or decrease, so only U moves are useful for going up.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can start later, but that would increase H.\n\nOr if I go down first, but that would require more moves to compensate, so H larger.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nAt turn t=38, I am at (0,2), which is freeway 2, and it is safe at t=38, as we saw.\n\nThen I move up.\n\nBut at t=40, freeway 2 is unsafe, but at t=40, I am not on freeway 2; I am on freeway 4.\n\nIn the position timeline:\n\nAt turn T=38: position y=2 (freeway 2)\n\nAfter action a_{38}=U, at turn T=39: position y=3 (freeway 3)\n\nAt T=39, freeway 3 is safe, as span [-47,-12] no 0.\n\nThen a_{39}=U, at T=40: position y=4 (freeway 4)\n\nAt T=40, freeway 4 is safe, as always.\n\nNot on freeway 2 or 3 at T=40.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should check if y=2 is safe at other times, but I don't need, since I leave immediately.\n\nAnother thing: the car update, but I think I handled the times correctly.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 and 8, at t=50-52, but I reach t=45, before that, so no issue.\n\nSo I think H=7 with all U actions is fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and I think 7 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in less, but impossible, since 7 steps needed.\n\nUnless I start from y=2, to y=9, difference 7, so at least 7 U actions, so H at least 7.\n\nWith S or D, it would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nAnd the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to list the actions.\n\nSo for turn t_1=38: a_{38} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1 =39: a_{39} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 +6 =44: a_{44} = U\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nThe player reaches at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t_1, after first action, at turn t_1 +1, and so on, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut at that point, I am at position.\n\nIn this case, after 7 actions, at turn 38+7=45, y=9.\n\nAnd t_1 + H = 38 +7 =45.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter executing these H actions, the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9)? No.\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nThen I perform action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo, starting from turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nI perform action a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nThen perform a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter performing a_{t_1 + H-1}, y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1 + H-1} + Δy_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} =9? But the reach time is t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the text: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd the sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nNow, with actions from t=0 to H-1, the position after last action is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut it says reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency?\n\nLet me see.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} (which is the first action, t=0), at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1} (t=1), at turn t_1 +2, position y_{t_1 +2}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k} for k from 0 to H-1, at turn t_1 + (k+1)\n\nAfter last action a_{t_1 + (H-1)}, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, meaning y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, when we perform the actions, y_{t_1 + H -1} is set before the last action or something.\n\nLet's index.\n\nAt turn T, position is fixed.\n\nThen I choose action a_T.\n\nThen position at T+1 is determined.\n\nTo have position at some turn equal to 9.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 means actions taken at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, i.e., at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter executing these, the next position is at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we need position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1, it must be 9, and that position is reached before the action at t_1 + H -1 is taken? No.\n\nPosition at turn T is before action at T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then I perform a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at position 9.\n\nNow, the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} to reach y_{t_1 + H -1}? Let's see.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t_1 +1} = something, it depends on a_{t_1}.\n\ny_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t_1 + k}  ? Let's find the indices.\n\ny_{t_1 + m} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{m-1} Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nFor m=1: y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nFor m=2: y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}\n\nSo y_{t_1 + m} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{m-1} Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nNow, we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\n\nSo y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{(H-1)-1} Δy_{t_1 + k} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t_1 + k} =9\n\nBut the actions are from k=0 to H-1 for Δy_{t_1 + k}, but in the sum, for y_{t_1 + H-1}, it depends on actions from k=0 to H-2.\n\ny_{t_1 + H-1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nAnd this must be 9.\n\nThe sequence includes a_{t_1 + k} for k=0 to H-1, which sets Δy_{t_1 + k} for k=0 to H-1.\n\nBut for y_{t_1 + H-1}, it only depends on Δy up to k=H-2.\n\nThe last action a_{t_1 + H-1} affects y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, the actions from t=0 to t=H-2 affect y_{t_1 + H-1}, and action at t=H-1 affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H-1} =9, so the last action a_{t_1 + H-1} is not used to reach position at t_1 + H-1; it is used for the next position.\n\nIn this case, to reach at turn t_1 + H-1, we need actions from t=0 to t=H-2 to set the position.\n\nBut the sequence includes H actions, up to a_{t_1 + H-1}, but only the first H-1 actions affect the position at t_1 + H-1.\n\nFor example, with H=7, we need y_{t_1 + 6} =9.\n\nt_1=38, so y_{44} =9.\n\nNow, y_{44} = y_{38} + sum_{k=0}^{5} Δy_{38 + k} = 2 + sum of 6 Δy's =9, so sum of 6 Δy's must be +7, which requires all U except one S or something, but since each U is +1, to increase by 7 in 6 steps, I need all U, but 6 U give +6, from y=2 to y=8.\n\ny_{44} = y_{38} + sum_{k=0}^{5} Δy_{38+k}\n\nIf all U, Δy=1 each, sum=6, y_{44} =2+6=8.\n\nThen to be at y=9 at t=44, I need y_{44}=9, so I need sum of 6 Δy's to be +7, but each Δy <=1, so maximum +6, impossible to have y_{44}=9 from y_{38}=2 in 6 steps? 2 +6=8, yes.\n\ny_{t_1 + H-1} = y_{38 + H-1}\n\nSet m = H-1, so we need y_{t_1 + m} =9 with m = H-1.\n\ny_{t_1 + m} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{m-1} Δy_{t_1 + k} =2 + sum_{k=0}^{m-1} Δy_{38+k} =9\n\nSo sum_{k=0}^{m-1} Δy_{38+k} =7\n\nSince each Δy <=1, I need at least 7 U actions, so m-1 >=7, so m >=8.\n\nThus H-1 >=8, H>=9.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H-1} = y_{38 + H-1} =9.\n\nWith H actions from k=0 to H-1.\n\nBut for the position, to reach at turn T= t_1 + H-1, it requires at least 7 U actions in the sum from k=0 to (H-1)-1 = H-2.\n\nThe actions that affect y_{t_1 + H-1} are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-2}, which are the first H-1 actions in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, but only the first H-1 are used to reach the position at t_1 + H-1.\n\nThe last action a_{t_1 + H-1} determines y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that, since we reach at t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, to have y_{t_1 + H-1} =9, with y_{t_1} =2, I need the cumulative Δy from actions at t_1 to t_1 + H-2 to sum to +7.\n\nSo I need at least 7 U actions among the first H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe actions that contribute to y_{t_1 + H-1} are a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-2, that's H-1 actions.\n\nΔy_{t_1} to Δy_{t_1 + H-2}\n\nSum from k=0 to H-2 of Δy_{t_1 + k} =7\n\nEach Δy <=1, so I need at least 7 of these actions to be U, and no D, so H-1 >=7, so H >=8.\n\nThen with H-1 >=7, I can have sum=7 with all U, for example.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H-1} =2 +7=9.\n\nThe last action a_{t_1 + H-1} can be anything, but it doesn't affect the position at t_1 + H-1.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to specify it, but since I reach at t_1 + H-1, the action at t_1 + H-1 is not necessary, but I have to include it in the sequence for H turns.\n\nMoreover, after that action, I might be at different position, but since I already reached, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t_1 + H-1, I am at y=9, which is safe, and I perform an action, but the collision is checked at the position before action, I think.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if on freeway y_T and car at x=0.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and car on that freeway has 0 in span.\n\nThen I perform action.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H-1, I am at y=9, safe, no issue.\n\nThen I perform a_{t_1 + H-1}, which could be U, D, S, but since y=9, if U, it might try to go to y=10, but y in [0,9], so probably y stays 9 if U or S, or to 8 if D.\n\nBut since I reach at t_1 + H-1, it doesn't affect.\n\nNow, in my earlier plan, with H=7, I reached at t=45, which is t_1 +7.\n\nBut to reach at t_1 + H-1, with H=7, t_1 + H-1=38+6=44.\n\nAt t=44, in the sequence with all U, I was at y=8.\n\ny_{44} =8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=44, I need to have moved faster, but I can't, since only +1 per step.\n\nSo with actions from t=38 to t=43 (6 actions), I can be at y_{44} = y_{38} + sum Δy from t=38 to t=43? y_{44} = y_{38} + sum_{k=0}^{5} Δy_{38+k} because y_{44} = y_{38} + Δy_{38} + ... + Δy_{43}, which is 6 terms.\n\nMax sum 6, y_{44} =2+6=8.\n\nCannot be 9 at t=44.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, with start at t=38 y=2, I need at least 7 steps, so earliest at t=45.\n\nt=45 = t_1 +7.\n\nBut to reach at t_1 + H -1, so t_1 + H -1 =45, so 38 + H -1 =45, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =38 +8 -1=45.\n\nThen with H=8, I can reach at turn 45.\n\nThe sequence has H=8 actions: from a_{38} to a_{45}? t from 0 to 7, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 7, so a_{38} to a_{45}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{45} =9.\n\nWith actions from a_{38} to a_{44} affecting y_{45}? y_{45} = y_{38} + sum_{k=0}^{6} Δy_{38+k}\n\nSet to 9, so sum_{k=0}^{6} Δy_{38+k} =7.\n\nI can have, for example, seven U and one S or something.\n\nSince I need exactly +7 in 7 steps, I can have all U from a_{38} to a_{44}, then y_{45} =2 +7=9.\n\nBut the actions include a_{45}, which is the last one.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1=7, so a_{38} to a_{45}.\n\na_{38} to a_{44} are 7 actions, with all U, then y_{45} =9.\n\nThen a_{45} can be, say, S or U, but since at y=9, U might not change, or S.\n\nBut it doesn't matter.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t=45, I am at y=9, safe, then I perform a_{45}, no issue.\n\nWith H=8, I can reach at t=45.\n\nBut with H=7 in the earlier misunderstanding, I also reached at t=45 with y=9.\n\nIn the first part, with 7 actions from t=38 to t=44, I reached at t=45 y=9.\n\nBut according to the task, to reach at t_1 + H -1, with H=7, t_1 + H -1=38+6=44, but at t=44 I was at y=8.\n\nSo to reach at t=44 y=9, impossible in 6 steps.\n\nSo I need to reach at later turn.\n\nEarliest possible to reach y=9 is t=45, with 7 up moves.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1 =45, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen T=45.\n\nNow with H=8 actions: a_{38} to a_{45}.\n\ny_{45} = y_{38} + sum_{k=0}^{6} Δy_{38+k} =2 + sum of 7 Δy's from k=0 to 6, i.e., actions a_{38} to a_{44}.\n\nSet this sum to 7, so all U for a_{38} to a_{44}.\n\nThen a_{45} can be S, for example.\n\nThen at turn t=45, position y=9, reached.\n\na_{45} is performed, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, I have to specify all H actions.\n\nNow, for the path, I need to make sure that during the moves, I don't collide.\n\nWith all U from a_{38} to a_{44}, positions:\n\nAt turn t=38: y=2\n\na_{38}=U, at t=39 y=3\n\na_{39}=U, at t=40 y=4\n\na_{40}=U, at t=41 y=5\n\na_{41}=U, at t=42 y=6\n\na_{42}=U, at t=43 y=7\n\na_{43}=U, at t=44 y=8\n\na_{44}=U, at t=45 y=9\n\nThen a_{45}=S, but at t=45, y=9, then after a_{45}, if S, y_{46}=9, but we don't care.\n\nNow, at which turns am I on freeways: from t=38 to t=44, y from 2 to 8.\n\nt=38: y=2, freeway 2\n\nt=39: y=3, freeway 3\n\nt=40: y=4, freeway 4\n\nt=41: y=5, freeway 5\n\nt=42: y=6, freeway 6\n\nt=43: y=7, freeway 7\n\nt=44: y=8, freeway 8\n\nt=45: y=9, safe\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nt=38: y=2, freeway 2, T=38, safe as before\n\nt=39: y=3, freeway 3, T=39, safe\n\nt=40: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nt=41: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nt=42: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=43: y=7, freeway 7, T=43, safe as before\n\nt=44: y=8, freeway 8, T=44, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nWith H=8, I have an extra action at t=45, which I can set to S.\n\nBut H=8 is larger than 7, but since H must be at least 8 to reach at t=44? No.\n\nMinimal H: to reach y=9 from y=2, need at least 7 increases, so the earliest turn to be at y=9 is t=45.\n\nTo have y_T=9 for T=45, we need T = t_1 + H -1 =45, so 38 + H -1=45, H=8.\n\nThen H=8 is minimal.\n\nIf I could reach earlier, but I can't.\n\nFor example, if I start with U at t=38, earliest y=3 at t=39, y=4 at t=40, ..., y=9 at t=45.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nSo H=8 with actions from t=38 to t=45.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{38} to a_{45}, with a_{38} to a_{44} all U, and a_{45} can be S.\n\nThen y_{45}=9.\n\nIn the freeway check, at t=45 I am on y=9, no car, so safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 8 actions, but the first 7 are used to go up.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut in this case, H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car states if there is any problem.\n\nSince with all U, I am on y=7 at t=43 and y=8 at t=44, both safe as before.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path by going down, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nOr waiting, but also worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=8, actions: a_{38}=U, a_{39}=U, a_{40}=U, a_{41}=U, a_{42}=U, a_{43}=U, a_{44}=U, a_{45}=S\n\nThen at turn t=45, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=38 to t=45.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 +6: a_{t_1+6} = U  (since t_1+6=44)\n\nTurn t_1 +7: a_{t_1+7} = S  (t_1+7=45)\n\nH=8, t from 0 to 7.\n\nt=0: t_1 +0 =38\n\nt=1:39\n\n...\n\nt=6:44\n\nt=7:45\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nBut in the freeway at t=43 and t=44, we have y=7 and 8, which are safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a time when I need to avoid, but in this path, no.\n\nFor example, if I were on y=2 at t=40, but I am not, I am on y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought H=7, but due to the indexing, H=8 is required.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence with H=8 but reach earlier? No, 45 is earliest.\n\nAnother idea: if I use D or S to wait, but that would make me reach later, so y=9 at later turn, which requires larger H, so worse.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=2 for one turn, then go up, I reach y=9 at t=46, then H would be larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nNow for the action at t=45, I set to S, but it could be U or D, but since y=9, U or S both keep y=9, D goes to 8, but I don't care.\n\nSet S for simplicity.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions except the last one are U, last one S.\n\nBut since the last action doesn't affect reaching, it can be anything.\n\nBut in output, I need to specify.\n\nNow, back to the car on freeway 7 and 8, at t=50-52, but I am done by t=45, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the number.\n\nt_1=38\n\nReach at t=45 = t_1 +7\n\nt_1 + H -1 =45, 38 + H -1=45, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nYes.\n\nSequence: a_{38} = U, a_{39} = U, a_{40} = U, a_{41} = U, a_{42} = U, a_{43} = U, a_{44} = U, a_{45} = S\n\nIn terms of the turn labels:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{t_1 +3} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: a_{t_1 +4} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +5: a_{t_1 +5} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: a_{t_1 +6} = U  (this is a_{44})\n\nTurn t_1 +7: a_{t_1 +7} = S  (a_{45})\n\nH=8.\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we checked.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 38 + 8 - 1 = 45\\) is 8, with the sequence of actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 38\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to move the player upward from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in the fewest turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The actions \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, S\\}\\) are chosen as follows:\n- Actions from turn 38 to 44 are all \\(U\\) (up) to increase the \\(y\\)-coordinate by 1 each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45.\n- The action at turn 45 is \\(S\\) (stay) since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\) and no further movement is needed, but it is included to complete the \\(H = 8\\) actions.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 38. Freeway 2 (at \\(y = 2\\)) is safe at turn 38, as no car has 0 in its span (span is \\([-83, -48]\\), 0 not in range).\n- At turn 39, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Freeway 3 is safe at turn 39 (span \\([-47, -12]\\), 0 not in range).\n- At turn 40, the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is always safe, as the car span \\([25 + 24\\tau, 48 + 24\\tau]\\) for \\(\\tau = T - 38\\) has a minimum \\(x\\)-value of 25 (at \\(\\tau = 0\\)), which is always positive.\n- At turn 41, the player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is always safe for the same reason as freeway 4.\n- At turn 42, the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is always safe for the same reason.\n- At turn 43, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is safe at turn 43, as it is unsafe only at turns 40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52, and turn 43 is not in this set.\n- At turn 44, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is safe at turn 44, as it is unsafe only at turns 40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52, and turn 44 is not in this set.\n- At turn 45, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe as it has no cars.\n\nThus, no collisions occur during the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{38} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{39} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{40} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{41} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{42} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{43} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{44} = U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 7: a_{45} = S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 40. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed, and their positions update linearly over time. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is within its span at that turn. Importantly, if I move to a new row at turn T, I'm not on that new row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t_1=40. For any future turn T, I can compute the span for each car based on its direction and speed.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (h=24, τ=-11, d=right, s=36). Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-11 + 36(T-40), 24 + 36(T-40)]\n\n- Freeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (24, -11, right, 36) for k=2 as well. Let me check.\n\nIn the table, for k=1,2,3 it's all (24,-11,right,36), and for k=4,5,6 it's (-48,-71,right,24), and for k=7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nk is the freeway number, I think. So:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\n- Freeway 2: one car: (24, -11, right, 36) — same as freeway 1? That might be a typo or perhaps it's identical for each.\n\nIt says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" and for k=1,2,3 it's listed as (24,-11,right,36), so I think each freeway has its own car, but the parameters are the same for 1,2,3.\n\nSimilarly for 4,5,6: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nAnd for 7 and 8, multiple cars: for k=7: three cars: (-40,-51,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)\n\nSimilarly for k=8: same three cars.\n\nI need to be careful with the head and tail. For right-moving cars, head is the front, so if d=right, head is larger than tail, I assume. In the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nLet me confirm from the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail, and for left, head > tail? The update says for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] -> at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36), and since d=right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24), but τ=-71, h=-48, so [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nFor freeway 7: (-40,-51,right,4), so τ=-51, h=-40? But it says (head h, tail τ), so for this car, h=-40, τ=-51, and d=right, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-51, -40]\n\nSimilarly, (36,25,right,4): h=36, τ=25, span [25,36]\n\nAnd (0,-11,right,4): h=0, τ=-11, span [-11,0]\n\nBut h=0 and τ=-11, so at t1, span is [-11,0], which includes 0. But the player is at y=4 at turn 40, so on freeway 4, but this car is on freeway 7, so different row.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nSince the player is moving vertically, and cars are moving horizontally, we only care about the x=0 position for collision.\n\nAlso, when the player moves to a new row, at the turn they move, they are still on the old row for that turn, and only on the new row from the next turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1)\"\n\nSo, at turn T, player is on row y_T. They choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nDuring turn T, they are on row y_T, so they can collide with cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, they are on row y_{T+1}, so they can collide with cars on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on the row the player is on at the start of the turn.\n\nNow, I need to get to (0,9). Since x is always 0 for player, we just care about y.\n\nStart at y=4 at t=40.\n\nI need to reach y=9. Each move can change y by -1,0,+1, so minimum moves would be 5 up moves, but I have to avoid the cars on rows 1 to 8.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, no collision possible.\n\nThe freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. So at y=0 or y=9, no collision risk.\n\nBut I start at y=4, which is a freeway, so I need to check for collision at t=40.\n\nAt t=40, player is on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: from the table, k=4 has (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nd=right, s=24, span at t=40: [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] but at T=t1, it's given.\n\nFor freeway 4 at t=40: car is (-48,-71,right,24), so span is [τ, h] = [-71, -48] since d=right.\n\nIs 0 in [-71, -48]? No, -48 to -71 is from -71 to -48, which is negative, so 0 not in span. So no collision at t=40 on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, I need to go from y=4 to y=9, passing through y=5,6,7,8, each of which has cars.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 in min turns, without being on a row when 0 is in a car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nSince moving up takes time, and cars move, the spans change over time, so I need to consider when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nFirst, let's define the time. Set t=40 as time zero for simplicity. Let τ = T - 40, so at τ=0, it's turn 40.\n\nThen for any future turn, at time τ, the car spans can be computed.\n\nPlayer position: start at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=H, with y_{τ} for τ from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt each step τ, y_{τ} is the position, and I choose a_τ which affects y_{τ+1}.\n\ny_{τ} is position at time τ.\n\nAt time τ, player is on row y_τ.\n\nCollision if for row k = y_τ, at time τ, there is a car on that row with 0 in its span.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I have the cars and their spans as a function of time.\n\nFirst, for freeways 1,2,3: each has one car with (h=24, τ=-11, d=right, s=36)\n\nSince d=right, span at time τ (relative to t1) is [τ_car + s * τ, h + s * τ] where τ_car and h are at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt time τ, span is [ -11 + 36τ, 24 + 36τ ]\n\n0 is in span if -11 + 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 36τ\n\nSince 24 + 36τ > 0 for all τ≥0, and -11 + 36τ ≤ 0 when 36τ ≤ 11, τ ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, and 0 ≤ 24 + 36τ always true for τ≥0.\n\nSo 0 in span when -11 + 36τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 24 + 36τ.\n\n-11 + 36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36τ ≤ 11 ⇒ τ ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSince τ is integer (turns), τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt τ=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, 0≤24, so 0 in span? -11 ≤0≤24, yes.\n\nBut τ=0 is the current time, and we are at y=4, not on freeway 1,2, or 3, so for row 1,2,3, at τ=0, 0 is in span for each, but since player is not on that row, no collision.\n\nFor row 1, at τ=0, car span [-11,24] includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for row 2 and 3, same car, same span, so all have 0 in span at τ=0.\n\nBut player is on y=4, so ok.\n\nNow for τ≥1.\n\n0 in span when τ ≤ floor(11/36) =0, since 11/36<1, so only at τ=0, for rows 1,2,3.\n\nAt τ=0, τ≤0.305, so τ=0.\n\nAt τ=1, -11 +36*1=25, which is >0, so 0 not ≤25? 0 ≤ 25 is true, but -11+36=25, so span [25, 24+36=60], so 25 to 60, 0 not in [25,60], so 0 not in span for τ≥1.\n\nSimilarly for all τ>0, -11+36τ ≥ -11+36=25>0, so span starts at 25 or more, so 0 not in span for τ≥1.\n\nSo for freeways 1,2,3, only at τ=0 is 0 in the car span, but since player not on them at τ=0, and for τ≥1, 0 never in span, so rows 1,2,3 are always safe to be on for τ≥1, except possibly at τ=0 which is past.\n\nFor τ≥1, no car covers 0, so no collision possible on rows 1,2,3 at any time τ≥1.\n\nNow freeways 4,5,6: each has car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nd=right, s=24.\n\nAt τ=0, span [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\n0 in span? -71 ≤ 0 ≤ -48? But -48 <0, so 0 not ≤ -48, false. So 0 not in span at τ=0.\n\nAt time τ, span [ -71 + 24τ, -48 + 24τ ]\n\n0 in span if -71 +24τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +24τ\n\nNow, -71 +24τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 24τ ≤ 71 ⇒ τ ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 +24τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 24τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSo for τ=2 and τ=3? τ≥2 and τ≤2.958, so τ=2 and τ=3? Let's see:\n\nAt τ=2: -71 +48 = -23 ≤0, and -48+48=0, so 0 ≤0 is true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=3: -71 +72=1, 1≤0? 1 ≤0 false, and -48+72=24, so span [1,24], 0 not in [1,24], so no.\n\n0 ≤ -48 +24τ: at τ=2, -48+48=0, so 0≤0 true.\n\nAt τ=3, -48+72=24, 0≤24 true, but -71+72=1, 1≤0 false, so inequality not both true.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1: -71+24= -47 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -48+24= -24? 0 ≤ -24 false.\n\nSo only at τ=2, 0 in span for rows 4,5,6.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=2, span is [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0], so includes 0.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8, it's more complex because multiple cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 7: three cars:\n\n1. (-40,-51,right,4) so h=-40, τ=-51, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at time τ: [ -51 +4τ, -40 +4τ ]\n\n2. (36,25,right,4) h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=4, span [25+4τ, 36+4τ]\n\n3. (0,-11,right,4) h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=4, span [-11+4τ, 0+4τ] = [-11+4τ, 4τ]\n\nNow, for freeway 7, collision if at time τ, 0 is in any of these spans.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, same spans.\n\nNow, let's find for each τ when 0 is in one of the spans on row 7.\n\nFirst car: [ -51 +4τ, -40 +4τ ]\n\n0 in this if -51+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -40+4τ\n\n-51+4τ ≤0 ⇒ 4τ ≤51 ⇒ τ ≤ 51/4 = 12.75\n\n0 ≤ -40+4τ ⇒ 40 ≤4τ ⇒ τ ≥10\n\nAlso, since τ integer, τ from 10 to 12 inclusive? τ≥10 and τ≤12.75, so τ=10,11,12.\n\nCheck:\n\nτ=10: -51+40= -11 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -40+40=0 true, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nτ=11: -51+44= -7 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -40+44=4 true, span [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nτ=12: -51+48= -3 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -40+48=8 true, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=13: -51+52=1 >0, so 1≤0 false, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo car 1 covers τ=10,11,12.\n\nSecond car: [25+4τ, 36+4τ], both positive for τ≥0, min 25>0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nThird car: [-11+4τ, 4τ]\n\n0 in this if -11+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 4τ\n\n-11+4τ ≤0 ⇒ 4τ ≤11 ⇒ τ ≤ 11/4 = 2.75\n\n0 ≤ 4τ always for τ≥0.\n\nSo τ ≤2.75, τ=0,1,2.\n\nAt τ=0: [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=1: [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=2: [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=3: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 7, 0 is covered:\n\n- By third car at τ=0,1,2\n\n- By first car at τ=10,11,12\n\n- Not covered at other times.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same.\n\nNow, freeway 7 is row 7, etc.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, on row 4.\n\nRow 4 has car: as above, at τ=0, 0 not in span, since span [-71,-48], 0 not in. And only at τ=2 it is covered, but at τ=0, not.\n\nSo at τ=0, safe on row 4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe dangerous rows are where cars can cover 0 at certain times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Rows 1,2,3: only unsafe at τ=0, but τ=0 past, so safe for τ≥1\n\n- Rows 4,5,6: unsafe only at τ=2\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at τ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\n- Row 8: same as row 7, unsafe at τ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\nRow 7 and 8 have the same cars, so same unsafe times.\n\nAlso, row 4,5,6 are unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay).\n\nBut since I need to go up, down might not be useful, but sometimes waiting is needed.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=4 to y=9, need +5 in y, so at least 5 up moves. But I can stay or move down, which would increase H, so probably not minimal, but to avoid collision, I might need to wait.\n\nSince rows 1,2,3 are always safe after τ=0, and I start at 4, going down might not help, as rows below might have issues, but row 0 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so safe always.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up to 9.\n\nNow, the critical points are row 4,5,6 at τ=2, and row 7,8 at τ=0,1,2,10,11,12.\n\nτ=0 is now, I'm on row 4, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, if I am on row 4, is it safe?\n\nFor row 4, at τ=1, span [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47, -24], 0 not in, since both negative. Only at τ=2 it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for row 5 and 6, same, since all have identical cars.\n\nRow 5: freeway 5 has same car as 4, so unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly row 6.\n\nNow row 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=0,1,2,10,11,12.\n\nτ=0,1,2 are early times.\n\nI need to be careful when passing through rows 4,5,6 and 7,8.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at τ=0, and I need to go up.\n\nIf I go up immediately, at τ=0, I choose a_0, which affects y_1.\n\ny_τ is position at time τ.\n\nAt time τ, I am at y_τ, and I choose a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on a_τ.\n\nFor collision, at each τ, for the row y_τ, we check if 0 in car span for that row at time τ.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nList unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 4: unsafe at τ=2\n\n- Row 5: unsafe at τ=2\n\n- Row 6: unsafe at τ=2\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at τ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at τ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\n- Rows 1,2,3: unsafe only at τ=0, but since τ=0 past, safe for all τ\n\n- Rows 0 and 9: always safe\n\nI start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, if I go up at each step, I can reach y=9 in 5 steps: from τ=0 to τ=5.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, safe.\n\nChoose a: U, then y=5 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1: y=5, row 5.\n\nIs row 5 safe at τ=1? Row 5 has car, at τ=1, span [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen choose U: y=6 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2: y=6, row 6.\n\nAt τ=2, row 6 unsafe? At τ=2, for row 6, span [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23,0], 0 in span, so collision! Oh, cannot be on row 6 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on row 4 or 5 at τ=2, also unsafe.\n\nBut in this path, at τ=2, I am on y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on rows 4,5,6 at τ=2.\n\nNow, what about row 7 at τ=2? Also unsafe, since row 7 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nRow 8 same.\n\nSo at τ=2, rows 4,5,6,7,8 are all unsafe! Rows 4,5,6 because of their car, rows 7 and 8 because of their unsafe times.\n\nRow 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=2 anyway.\n\nSo at τ=2, I cannot be on rows 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWhere can I be? Rows 0,1,2,3,9.\n\nBut I start at 4, so I need to move away.\n\nFor example, I could go down to y=3 or stay, but let's see.\n\nSince rows 1,2,3 are safe at τ=2, and row 0 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nτ=2 is a problem time.\n\nI need to not be on rows 4-8 at τ=2.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at τ=0, I need to leave row 4 before τ=2 or be elsewhere.\n\nAt τ=0, I can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at τ=0: a=S, then y_1 = y_0 =4? No.\n\nAt time τ, after action, y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nLet's clarify the timeline.\n\nAt time τ, player is at position y_τ.\n\nThen player chooses action a_τ.\n\nThen y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nThen at time τ+1, player is at y_{τ+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at time τ based on y_τ and the cars at that time.\n\nSo for τ=0: y=4, safe.\n\nI choose a_0.\n\nIf a_0 = S, then y_1 =4.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=4, row 4 at time τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, row 4 is safe, as span [-47,-24], no 0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I choose a_1.\n\nIf I choose U, y_2=5.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=5, row 5 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=1 I choose S, y_2=4, then at τ=2, y=4, row 4 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose D, y_2=3, then at τ=2, y=3, row 3.\n\nRow 3: at τ=2, is it safe? Rows 1,2,3 are safe for all τ≥1, as we said earlier.\n\nSo y=3 at τ=2 is safe.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at τ=2, I need to be on row <=3 or 9, but 9 is far.\n\nSo one option is to go down to a safe row at τ=2.\n\nFor example, from start:\n\nAt τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nI choose a_0 = D, then y_1 = 4 -1 =3.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3, row 3.\n\nRow 3 at τ=1: safe, since rows 1,2,3 safe after τ=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I choose a_1.\n\nIf I choose S, y_2=3.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nThen after τ=2, I can go up.\n\nBut at τ=2, rows above are unsafe, but after τ=2, they become safe except row 7 and 8 have unsafe times later.\n\nAfter τ=2, row 4,5,6 are safe for all other times, since only unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 and 8 are unsafe at τ=10,11,12, but safe in between.\n\nτ=10,11,12 are later.\n\nFirst, let's get past τ=2.\n\nSo, to avoid τ=2 on unsafe rows, I can be on row 3 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSince I start at y=4, if I go down to y=3 at τ=1, then stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nAt τ=0: choose D, y_1=3\n\nAt τ=1: y=3, safe. I can choose S, so y_2=3, at τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, I can start going up.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, choose U, y_3=4\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, row 4.\n\nAt τ=3, row 4 safe? At τ=3, span [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 and 6 also safe at τ=3.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut I have to go through row 7 and 8, which have unsafe times at τ=10,11,12.\n\nτ=10 is far, I might reach y=9 before that.\n\nLet's see the minimal time.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=2, I have y from 4 to 3, so I lost one step down.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3\n\nChoose U: at τ=3, y=4\n\nChoose U: at τ=4, y=5\n\nChoose U: at τ=5, y=6\n\nChoose U: at τ=6, y=7\n\nNow at τ=6, y=7, row 7.\n\nIs row 7 safe at τ=6?\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at τ=0,1,2,10,11,12.\n\nτ=6 not in that, so should be safe.\n\nAt τ=6, what is the span?\n\nFor row 7, cars: at τ=6.\n\nFirst car: span [-51+4*6, -40+4*6] = [-51+24, -40+24] = [-27, -16], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, choose U: at τ=7, y=8\n\nAt τ=7, y=8, row 8.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=7, should be safe.\n\nSpans: same as row 7 but for row 8.\n\nFirst car: [-51+28, -40+28] = [-23, -12], 0 not in? -23 to -12, all negative.\n\n-40+4*7= -40+28= -12, -51+28= -23, so [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+28, 36+28] = [53,64], no.\n\nThird car: [-11+28, 28] = [17,28], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen choose U: at τ=8, y=9\n\nAt τ=8, y=9, which is safe, and I reached y=9.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns? From τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 turns? Let's see the time.\n\nτ=0: turn 40, y=4\n\nAfter actions from τ=0 to τ=7, I reach y=9 at τ=8.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=40 to t=47, 8 actions? Let's list.\n\nSet τ = T - 40.\n\nAt time τ: position y_τ, action a_τ chosen.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y_H.\n\nI start at τ=0, after H actions, at τ=H, y_H.\n\nI need y_H =9.\n\nIn this case:\n\nτ=0: y=4\n\na_0: D (down), so y_1 = 3\n\nτ=1: y=3\n\na_1: S (stay), y_2=3\n\nτ=2: y=3\n\na_2: U, y_3=4\n\nτ=3: y=4\n\na_3: U, y_4=5\n\nτ=4: y=5\n\na_4: U, y_5=6\n\nτ=5: y=6\n\na_5: U, y_6=7\n\nτ=6: y=7\n\na_6: U, y_7=8\n\nτ=7: y=8\n\na_7: U, y_8=9\n\nAt τ=8, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_0 to a_7, that's 8 actions, H=8 turns? H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nt1=40.\n\nAfter actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H-1}, the position at turn t1 + H -1 should be 9? Let's parse.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen, after these H actions, the position is at time t1 + H.\n\nBut we need the position at some turn to be 9.\n\nThe player update: after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at turn t, we have y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, we set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9? The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nYes: \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1+H-1, y_{t1+H} is set, but we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} is the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, we set y_{t1+H}, but y_{t1+H-1} is before the action.\n\nIn terms of state: at turn T, position y_T, then choose a_T, then y_{T+1} is set.\n\nWe need that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H -1.\n\nWith actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1 affecting up to y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} is set before action a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIn the sequence, for T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nAnd actions a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1 are applied, but a_{t1+H-1} affects y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} is the position at the start of turn t1+H-1, and we choose a_{t1+H-1} which may change it for the next turn.\n\nBut to have y_{t1+H-1} =9, it means that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9, and we don't necessarily move, but we can choose an action, but since we are at 9, we can stay or whatever, but the position is 9 at that turn.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t1+H-1} can be chosen, but it doesn't affect y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I reached y=9 at τ=8, which is t=40+8=48.\n\nτ=8 means t=48.\n\ny_8=9 at τ=8.\n\nτ=8 is time index, t=40+τ.\n\nSo at turn t=48, y=9.\n\nNow, t=48 = t1 + 8, since t1=40.\n\nt1 + H -1 =40 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 48, so 40 + H -1 =48, so 39 + H =48, H=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=8, so 9 actions? t from 0 to 8, that's 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn my path: at τ=0 (t=40), y=4, action a_40 = D (down)\n\nThen y_41=3\n\nAt τ=1 (t=41), y=3, action a_41 = S (stay)\n\ny_42=3\n\nAt τ=2 (t=42), y=3, action a_42 = U (up)\n\ny_43=4\n\nAt τ=3 (t=43), y=4, action a_43 = U\n\ny_44=5\n\nAt τ=4 (t=44), y=5, action a_44 = U\n\ny_45=6\n\nAt τ=5 (t=45), y=6, action a_45 = U\n\ny_46=7\n\nAt τ=6 (t=46), y=7, action a_46 = U\n\ny_47=8\n\nAt τ=7 (t=47), y=8, action a_47 = U\n\ny_48=9\n\nNow, at turn t=48, y=9.\n\nt=48 = t1 + 8, since t1=40.\n\nt = t1 + H -1 =40 + H -1 =48, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is this minimal? H=9 turns.\n\nBut I used a down move and a stay, which cost extra turns.\n\nCan I do with fewer?\n\nMinimal without obstacles is 5 up moves, but with obstacles, might need more.\n\nI could avoid going down.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, instead of going down, I could go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nThen I need to not be on rows 4,5,6 at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=2, I could be on row 7 or something, but row 7 is unsafe at τ=2.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nI could be on row 3 or below.\n\nBut from y=5 at τ=1, if I go down, y=4 at τ=2, but row 4 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIf I go down to y=4 at τ=2, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 at τ=2, collision on row 5.\n\nIf I go up to y=6 at τ=2, collision on row 6.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I must leave rows 4,5,6 before τ=2 or be off them.\n\nSince at τ=1 I am on row 5, I can go down to row 4, but that is worse.\n\nFrom τ=1, y=5, I could go down to y=4, but at τ=2, y=4 or y=5 or y=6 all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on row 3 or row 7, but row 7 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be on row 4,5,6 at τ=2 without collision.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on rows 4,5,6 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7 and 8 also unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=2, I must be on row <=3 or row 9.\n\nBut row 9 is far, so only rows 0,1,2,3.\n\nSince I start at 4, I need to move down to reach row 3 or below by τ=2.\n\nIn my previous plan, I went to row 3 at τ=1 and stayed, so at τ=2 on row 3.\n\nI could go down faster.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go down to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go down to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2 on row 2, safe.\n\nBut then I have to go up from lower, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at τ=2, go up to y=3 at τ=3, y=4 at τ=4, etc., up to y=9 at τ=9, which is later than before.\n\nτ=9, t=49, H=10, worse.\n\nSo my first plan is better.\n\nAt τ=0, stay at y=4, but then at τ=1, y=4, then I need to move, but at τ=1, if I go down to y=3, then at τ=2, y=3 safe.\n\nThen same as before, reach y=9 at τ=8.\n\nIn my sequence: from y=4 at τ=0, down to y=3 at τ=1, stay at τ=1 to y=3 at τ=2, then up.\n\nAt τ=1, I stayed, but I could have gone up immediately after moving down, but at τ=2 I need to be safe.\n\nAfter going down to y=3 at τ=1, at τ=1 I could choose U to go to y=4 at τ=2, but at τ=2, y=4 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I must be on row <=3 at τ=2, so I need to stay or go down at τ=1 if I am at y=3.\n\nSo in the sequence, I have to have y_2 <=3.\n\nIn my plan, y_2=3.\n\nThen from there, I go up.\n\nBut in the up phase, I go through row 7 and 8 at τ=6 and τ=7, which is fine, since τ=6 and 7 are not unsafe times for row 7 and 8.\n\nUnsafe times are τ=0,1,2,10,11,12, so τ=6,7 are safe.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I go up at τ=0 to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nBut I cannot be on row 5 at τ=2, so I must move to a safe row at τ=2.\n\nBut from y=5, I can go down to y=4, but row 4 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nGo to y=6, row 6 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=5, stay, unsafe.\n\nNo: the only safe rows at τ=2 are 0,1,2,3.\n\nFrom y=5, I can go down to y=4, but that's row 4, unsafe.\n\ny=5 to y=4 is down, but at τ=2, I would be on y=4 if I go down at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose D, then y_2 = y_1 + (-1) = 5 -1 =4, so at τ=2, y=4, on row 4, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose U, y_2=6, row 6, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose S, y_2=5, row 5, unsafe.\n\nNo action from y=5 at τ=1 can get me to a safe row at τ=2, because the only safe rows are below, but I can only move to adjacent rows, so from y=5, I can go to y=4,5,6, all unsafe at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on row 5 at τ=1 and avoid collision at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I start by staying at τ=0: a=S, y_1=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=4.\n\nNow, from y=4 at τ=1, I can choose to go down to y=3, then at τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nOr go up to y=5, but then as above, stuck.\n\nBut if I go down to y=3 at τ=1? At τ=1, y=4, choose D, y_2=3.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nSame as before, but I didn't go down at τ=0.\n\nIn this case: at τ=0, y=4, I choose S, so y_1=4.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=4, I choose D, y_2=3.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen I can go up: at τ=2, choose U, y_3=4\n\nAnd so on, same as before, but I saved one action? No.\n\nIn previous, I had a down at τ=0 and stay at τ=1.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I stay, then at τ=1 down.\n\nThen at τ=2, same position y=3.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nτ=0 (t=40): a=S, y=4 (still, but y_1=4? At τ=0, after action S, y_1=4, meaning at τ=1, y=4.\n\nThen at τ=1 (t=41): y=4, choose D, y_2=3\n\nτ=2 (t=42): y=3, choose U, y_3=4\n\nτ=3 (t=43): y=4, U, y_4=5\n\n...\n\nUp to y_8=9 at τ=8.\n\nSame as before, reached at τ=8.\n\nH: t1 + H -1 =48, 40 + H -1=48, H=9.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nI could go directly from y=4 at τ=0 to U, but then at τ=1 y=5, then I have to deal with τ=2.\n\nBut as above, impossible to be safe at τ=2 from there.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 or something, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 7 or 8 before τ=2, but row 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go U to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, go U to y=6 at τ=2, but at τ=2, row 6 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up faster, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nMinimal up moves needed: 5, but I have to spend at least one turn not going up because of τ=2.\n\nIn my path, I have one down and one stay, so net +3 in y from τ=0 to τ=8, from y=4 to y=9, +5, but I moved down once, so I need extra up to compensate, but in the sequence, I had down at some point, then up multiple times.\n\nIn terms of y change: start y=4, end y=9, delta +5.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nIn my action sequence: actions: D, S, U, U, U, U, U, U? In the first sequence: a0=D, a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U\n\nSo actions: D, S, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nThat's 8 actions: one D, one S, six U.\n\ny: from 4, down to 3, stay at 3, then up to 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo y changes: -1, 0, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, net +5, yes.\n\nBut the S at a1 could be avoided?\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go D to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of S, I could go U, but if I go U at τ=1, y_2=4, then at τ=2, y=4, row 4, unsafe.\n\nSo I must be at y<=3 at τ=2, so at τ=1, if I am at y=3, I cannot go up; I must stay or go down.\n\nIf I go down to y=2, then at τ=2, y=2, safe, but then I have to go up from lower, which takes more time.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at τ=2, go U to y=3 τ=3, U to y=4 τ=4, ..., up to y=9 at τ=9, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the stay at τ=1 is necessary to wait at y=3 until τ=2 passes.\n\nI could have gone down at τ=0 to y=3, and at τ=1 go down to y=2, but same issue.\n\nSo minimal is to be at y=3 at τ=2, then start going up.\n\nNow, in the up phase, I go directly to 9, but I have to consider row 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=10,11,12.\n\nBut in my plan, I reach y=9 at τ=8, which is before τ=10, so no problem.\n\nτ=8 <10, so row 7 and 8 are safe at that time.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nSuppose I go up immediately but skip some rows or something, but I have to pass through each row.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nThen, since I cannot stay on rows 4-6 at τ=2, and I can't go to safe row, but what if I go to row 7 at τ=2? But row 7 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 3 at τ=2 by moving down earlier.\n\nBut I start at 4, so down to 3 at τ=1, then at τ=1, I have to stay or go down to be safe at τ=2.\n\nNo faster.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go down; I could go up to row 9 directly but slowly, but I have to avoid τ=2 on middle rows.\n\nBut since rows 4,5,6 are only unsafe at τ=2, and I can pass through them at other times quickly.\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 4 at τ=0, which is safe, then at τ=1, go to row 5, safe at τ=1, then at τ=2, I need to not be on row 5, so I must go to row 4 or 6 or stay, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can jump to row 3 or 7, but I can only move to adjacent.\n\nSo impossible to avoid without deviating.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from t=40 to t=47.\n\nt1=40.\n\nActions: a_{40}, a_{41}, ..., a_{47}, that's 8 actions, H=9 turns? H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nt1 + H -1 =48, so turn 48 is when we are at y=9.\n\nActions at turns 40 to 47.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed from turn t1.\n\nNow, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in my sequence, I used a down and a stay, but perhaps I can avoid the stay by going down and then up later, but I have to wait until after τ=2 to go up.\n\nIn the sequence above, with stay: at τ=1, I stayed.\n\nBut if at τ=0 I go down to y=3 at τ=1, then at τ=1 I can only choose actions that keep me at or below y=3 for τ=2.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at τ=2, then I start from lower.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=2, need 7 up moves, plus the down, but net.\n\nStart y=4, go down to y=3 at τ=1 (one action), then down to y=2 at τ=2 (second action), then from τ=2 y=2, go up: τ=3 y=3, τ=4 y=4, ..., τ=8 y=8, τ=9 y=9. So at τ=9, y=9, which is later, t=49, H=10.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at τ=1 and τ=2, same as before.\n\nBut at τ=1, if I am at y=3, I could go to y=4, but unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the stay is necessary to wait at safe position.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have two possibilities: one with down first and stay, or stay first and down.\n\nBut in terms of time, same.\n\nNow, for the later part, when I go through row 7 and 8, I did at τ=6 and τ=7, which is fine.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have unsafe times at τ=10,11,12, but since I pass before, no issue.\n\nIs there a way to reach y=9 faster than τ=8?\n\nFor example, if I start going up immediately after τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, go U to y=4 at τ=3, U to y=5 τ=4, U to y=6 τ=5, U to y=7 τ=6, U to y=8 τ=7, U to y=9 τ=8.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I could be higher at τ=2, but I can't.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, I go down to y=4, but at τ=2 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 0 or something, but that would take more time.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the car on row 4,5,6, at τ=2 only, but in my path, I pass row 4 at τ=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, for row 7 and 8, at τ=6 and 7, safe.\n\nBut let me confirm if at some point I might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, when I am on row 7 at τ=6.\n\nFreeway 7: at τ=6, as I computed, spans: car1 [-51+24, -40+24]=[-27,-16], no 0; car2 [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no; car3 [-11+24,24]=[13,24], no. Safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8 same.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), which I do at τ=8.\n\nIn the action sequence, for the last action, when I am at y=8 at τ=7, I choose U to go to y=9.\n\nBut at τ=7, y=8, which is row 8.\n\nIs row 8 safe at τ=7?\n\nFreeway 8: same as row 7, at τ=7.\n\nCar1: [-51+28, -40+28]=[-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [25+28,36+28]=[53,64], no\n\nCar3: [-11+28,28]=[17,28], no. Safe.\n\nThen action U, y=9 at τ=8.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn t1=40: action\n\nIn my first sequence: at turn 40 (τ=0), action D\n\nBut let's write clearly.\n\nI think I should output the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nNow, two options:\n\nOption A:\n\nTurn 40: D  (down to y=3)\n\nTurn 41: S  (stay at y=3)\n\nTurn 42: U  (up to y=4)\n\nTurn 43: U  (to y=5)\n\nTurn 44: U  (to y=6)\n\nTurn 45: U  (to y=7)\n\nTurn 46: U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 47: U  (to y=9)\n\nThen at turn 48, y=9, which is t1 + H -1 =40 + H -1=48, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=40 to 47, 8 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 47, action U, which sets y_48=9, but we need y_{t1+H-1}=y_{47}? t1+H-1=47 when H=8?

In the sequence:\n\nAfter actions:\n\nTurn 46: U (assuming from y46=7 to y47=8)\n\nAt turn 46, y46=7, which is row 7.\n\nAt time τ=6, turn 46, which is τ=6 (since t=46, τ=6)\n\nAs before, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 47: y47=8, row 8 at τ=7, safe.\n\nThen action U to y48=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have six U actions at the end, but I can start going up earlier if I use the other sequence.\n\nBut same time.\n\nTo avoid the stay, but I cannot.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to box the sequence.\n\nAlso, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the question asks for the sequence, and H is to be found.\n\nIn the output, I think just the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nBut I need to write the actions.\n\nNow, let me write clearly.\n\nUsing the first sequence:\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: S\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nBut with this, at turn 47, action U, y48=9.\n\nt1+H-1=48, H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 47: U, but y47=8, not 9.\n\nBut the position at turn 48 is 9, but we need y_{t1+H-1}=y_{48}=9.\n\nIn the action list, it's fine.\n\nTo have the sequence including the last action.\n\nAnother way: I could reach y=9 at turn 47 with H=8, but we saw impossible.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after τ=2.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=3, I go U to y=4 at τ=3, but I could, if possible, go directly to higher, but no, I can only move one step.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to write in the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states, but I think I covered.\n\nEspecially for row 7 and 8, at τ=6 and 7, safe, as computed.\n\nSo, the minimal number of turns H=9.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: S\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nIn this, turn 47: U to go to y=9, but at turn 47, position is y=8.\n\nThe action at turn 47 is U, which is fine.\n\nI could have a different sequence where I stay less, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother sequence: at turn 40: S\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nSame actions, just swap the first two.\n\nIn this case, turn 40: S, so at turn 40, position y=4, action S, so y41=4.\n\nThen turn 41: D, so y42=3.\n\nThen same up.\n\nAt turn 47: U, y48=9.\n\nSame.\n\nI can choose either.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 40\\) is 9, with the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 40 + 9 - 1 = 48\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The actions are determined based on the car movements and unsafe times:\n\n- Rows 4, 5, and 6 are unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 42) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- Rows 7 and 8 are unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12\\) (turns 40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52), but the player passes through these rows before \\(\\tau = 10\\), so only \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 2\\) are relevant.\n- Rows 1, 2, and 3 are safe for all \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\) (turns \\(\\geq 41\\)).\n- Rows 0 and 9 are always safe, as they are not freeways.\n\nStarting at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 40), the player must avoid being on rows 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 42). To achieve this:\n- At turn 40, move down to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as row 3 is safe at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n- At turn 41, stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- After \\(\\tau = 2\\), move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 48.\n\nThe action sequence ensures no collision:\n- At turn 46 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), \\(y = 7\\): row 7 is safe, as cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(\\tau = 6\\).\n- At turn 47 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), \\(y = 8\\): row 8 is safe, as cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(\\tau = 7\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}\n\nThis sequence results in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 48 with \\(H = 9\\) turns.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 42 and the player starts at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- U: y increases by 1 (if not at 9)\n- D: y decreases by 1 (if not at 0)\n- S: stay\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at the same time there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player), then collision.\n\nNote: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, they are only on freeway y at turn T (and not on y' until the next turn). So at the moment of the move (turn T), we only check the freeway we are leaving? Actually, the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are on the freeway corresponding to y_T (the starting freeway of that turn) and we check the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then we choose an action. After the action, the player moves to (0, y_{T+1]). However, during the entire turn T, we are considered to be on freeway y_T. So we only care about cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nTherefore, when the player is at freeway k at turn T, we must check that for all cars on freeway k, the car's span at turn T does not include 0.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\nAt a future turn T (>= t1), the car's span is:\n- If left-moving (d = left): [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- If right-moving (d = right): [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the problem states for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\nFor right-moving: initial span [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nActually, the initial representation in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Let me clarify:\n\nIn the table for freeway k, we have a list of cars. Each car is represented as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor a right-moving car: the head is the front (so the larger x-coordinate) and tail is the rear (smaller x-coordinate). So the span is [tail, head] (because the car extends from tail to head, and head > tail). Then at time T, it moves so the entire car shifts right by s*(T-t1). Therefore, the new span is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: the head is the front (which is the leftmost? Actually, no: if it's left-moving, then the head is the leading part, so it would be the smaller x-coordinate? But the problem says: left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So if the car is moving left, then the entire car moves left. So the head (h) is the leftmost? Actually, the representation might be consistent: the head is always the front of the car in the direction of travel.\n\nBut looking at the given data, all cars in the current state are right-moving. So we don't have left-moving examples.\n\nIn the given state:\nFreeways 1 to 6: each has one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) for freeway 1,2,3 and (-48, -71, right, 24) for 4,5,6.\nFreeway 7 and 8: each has three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nNote: for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail. But here, for example, (48,37): 48>37 -> head=48, tail=37 -> that's correct. Similarly, (12,1): 12>1 -> correct. (-24,-35): -24 > -35 -> correct.\n\nBut for the car (-48, -83, right, 36): note that -48 > -83, so head=-48, tail=-83. Then the span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48]. Then at time T, it becomes [-83 + 36*(T-t1), -48 + 36*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are at turn t1=42. We are to compute the car positions at future turns T (>=42).\n\nOur goal: we start at y0 = 0 at turn 42. We want to reach y=9. Since the grid is from y=0 to y=9, and the freeways (with cars) are from y=1 to y=8, we must traverse y=1 to y=8 without collision.\n\nNote: the player starts at (0,0) at turn 42. Then at turn 42, we are at freeway 0? But the freeways that have cars are only y=1 to 8. And the collision condition only applies when the player is on freeway y (from 1 to 8). So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nThe problem: we are at (0,0) at turn 42. We must end at (0,9) at some turn. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 9 moves (from 0 to 9: 0->1->2->...->9). But note: we can also move down or stay, so the minimal H might be more than 9 if we have to wait.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collisions when we are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting from turn 42 (t1) to the turn when we reach 9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at turn 42, the first action (at turn 42) will determine y at turn 43.\n\nWe are to output the actions for the turns: turn 42, turn 43, ... until the turn when we arrive at 9.\n\nLet me denote:\n- t0 = 42: we are at y=0.\n\nWe choose an action at turn 42: which can be U, D, or S.\n- If we choose U: then at turn 43, we are at y=1.\n- If we choose D: then we stay at 0 (since we are at 0, and D would try to go to -1, but it's clamped to 0) -> so we stay at 0.\n- If we choose S: we stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at any freeway, if we are at y=9 and choose U, we stay at 9.\n\nThe minimal H: we need to get to 9. The minimal number of moves is 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we might have to wait (use S or even D) to avoid collisions.\n\nSo we need to simulate the car movements and see when we can safely move up.\n\nWe are going to compute the positions of the cars on each freeway at each future turn.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, and we are only concerned with when the car spans on a particular freeway cover x=0, we can compute for each freeway and each car, the time intervals (if any) during which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the car spans are intervals that move continuously (in discrete steps) with time. For a given car on freeway k, we can compute the set of turns T for which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nHowever, the problem says: at turn T, we are on freeway k (if our y at turn T is k) and we must avoid that for any car on freeway k at turn T, 0 is in the car's span.\n\nSo for freeway k, we can precompute the set of turns T in which freeway k is unsafe (i.e., at least one car on k has 0 in its span).\n\nThen our path must avoid being on freeway k at an unsafe turn T.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 at turn 42 to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding being on a freeway k (for k=1..8) at a turn T when freeway k is unsafe.\n\nNote: we can stay at a safe freeway (like 0 or 9) as long as we want.\n\nBut note: at the starting turn 42, we are at y=0 (safe). We must eventually leave 0 to go to 1, then to 2, etc.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (in terms of turns T) when the car covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the condition for a car (on freeway k) to cover 0 at turn T is:\n\nFor a right-moving car: [tail + s*(T-42), head + s*(T-42)] contains 0.\n=> tail + s*(T-42) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-42)\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: [head - s*(T-42), tail - s*(T-42)] contains 0?\nBut note: the representation for left-moving: the update is [head - s*(T-42), tail - s*(T-42)]. However, for a left-moving car, the head is the front (which is the leftmost) and tail is the rear (rightmost). So the span is [head, tail] but then when moving left, the entire interval moves left. So the condition is:\nhead - s*(T-42) <= 0 <= tail - s*(T-42)\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have to worry about left-moving for this instance.\n\nSo let's focus on right-moving cars.\n\nCondition for a right-moving car (tail, head, speed s) at turn T (>=42):\ntail + s*(T-42) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-42)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\ntail + s*(T-42) <= 0  => T-42 <= -tail / s\n0 <= head + s*(T-42) => T-42 >= -head / s\n\nSo:\nT-42 >= ceil(-head / s) ? Actually, we are dealing with integers and the inequalities are inclusive.\n\nBut note: the car span is a continuous interval? Actually, the positions are integers? The problem doesn't specify, but the initial positions are integers and the speed is integer, so at integer turns, the car positions are integers.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nLet A = ceil( (-head) / s ) ? Actually, we have:\n\nhead + s*(T-42) >= 0  => s*(T-42) >= -head  => T-42 >= ceil(-head / s)  [if we are to use integer division?]\n\nBut note: since T is integer, and s, head, tail are integers, we can compute:\n\nLower bound: T-42 >= ceil( (-head) / s )   -> but actually, the inequality is: s*(T-42) >= -head. Since s is positive, we can write: T-42 >= ceil(-head / s) if we are using real numbers? However, we can rearrange:\n\nT >= 42 + ceil( (-head) / s )   ??? But note: because T must be integer, and the expression must hold.\n\nActually, we can write:\n\nThe smallest integer T such that head + s*(T-42) >= 0 is:\nif (-head) is divisible by s, then T0 = 42 + (-head)/s, then at T0 we have head + s*(T0-42) = 0, which is included.\nOtherwise, T0 = 42 + ceil( (-head) / s ) = 42 + floor( (-head + s - 1) / s )? \n\nBut we can avoid ceiling by:\n\nhead + s*(T-42) >= 0 \n=> T >= 42 + ceil( (-head) / s )   [if we consider real numbers, then ceiling]\n\nSimilarly, the condition tail + s*(T-42) <= 0:\ntail + s*(T-42) <= 0\n=> s*(T-42) <= -tail\n=> T-42 <= floor(-tail / s)   [because T is integer and s positive]\n\nSo the car covers 0 at turn T if:\nT_min = 42 + ceil( (-head) / s ) \nT_max = 42 + floor( (-tail) / s )\n\nBut note: the condition is:\nT-42 must satisfy: \n   T-42 >= ceil( (-head) / s )   [because head + s*(T-42) >= 0] \nand \n   T-42 <= floor( (-tail) / s )   [because tail + s*(T-42) <= 0]\n\nBut wait: the condition is:\n   tail + s*(T-42) <= 0   => T-42 <= (-tail) / s   (exact real inequality). Since T-42 is integer, we have T-42 <= floor( (-tail) / s )? Actually, no: because if (-tail)/s is not integer, then T-42 must be <= floor( (-tail)/s ). But note: the inequality is <=, so if we let k = T-42, then k must be <= (-tail)/s. The largest integer k satisfying k <= (-tail)/s is k = floor( (-tail)/s ). And the smallest k satisfying k >= (-head)/s is k = ceil( (-head)/s ).\n\nSo the set of k (>=0) for which the car covers 0 is:\nk_min = ceil( (-head) / s )\nk_max = floor( (-tail) / s )\n\nand then T = 42 + k, with k in [k_min, k_max].\n\nBut note: k must be nonnegative, and we only consider T>=42, so k>=0.\n\nHowever, if k_min > k_max, then there is no collision for this car.\n\nAlso, note that the car is present only for k such that k_min <= k <= k_max.\n\nNow, for a freeway, we have multiple cars. The freeway is unsafe at turn T (relative k = T-42) if at least one car on that freeway has k in [k_min, k_max] for that car.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway (1 to 8) the set of k (>=0) for which the freeway is unsafe.\n\nBut note: k is the number of turns after 42, so k=0 means turn 42, k=1 means turn 43, etc.\n\nWe start at k=0 at y=0 (safe). Then at each step, we choose an action (U, D, S) that moves the y accordingly, and we must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn when k is in the unsafe set for that freeway.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) such that we end at y=9. The sequence of actions is from turn 42 (k=0) to turn 42+H-1 (the last action is at turn 42+H-1, and then at the next state we are at turn 42+H, but the problem says: we are to output the actions until the turn when we reach 9. Actually, the player update: at turn t, we choose action a_t, and then we update to y_{t+1}. So we start at turn 42 at y=0, then at turn 42 we choose a_42, and then at turn 43 we are at y_43 = y_42 + Delta.\n\nWe must have that at turn 42+H-1 we choose an action that leads to y_{42+H} = 9. Then H is the number of actions, and the last action is at turn 42+H-1.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up 9 times without waiting). But we might have to wait at some freeways.\n\nSo we can model the state as (y, k) where y is the current freeway (0 to 9) and k is the current turn offset (k = T - 42). We start at (0,0). We want to reach (9, k) for some k. The cost is k (the total turns). We can do BFS in the state (y, k) but k can be large? However, we can bound k by the fact that we are only concerned with the unsafe intervals. Since the cars move periodically? Actually, the unsafe intervals are finite? Because the cars move at constant speed and eventually leave the x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving continuously and will eventually pass x=0. So for each freeway, the unsafe set is a contiguous interval of k? Actually, for each car, the unsafe set is a contiguous interval [k_min, k_max]. But for a freeway, the unsafe set is the union of the unsafe intervals of all its cars. Since the unsafe intervals for different cars might overlap, the union might be non contiguous. But we can precompute the union for each freeway.\n\nHowever, note: we are going to simulate step by step. But since the minimal H is at least 9, and we can wait arbitrarily long? But we want minimal H, so we are looking for the shortest path.\n\nWe can use BFS in the state (y, k) but k can be large? Actually, the unsafe intervals are finite, so after a certain k, all freeways become safe? Then we can go up without waiting. So the minimal path will not wait arbitrarily long.\n\nWe can compute the maximum k_max for each freeway. Then we can set a bound: for each freeway, the last unsafe turn is at most ...?\n\nLet me compute the unsafe intervals for each freeway.\n\nFirst, note that the cars are given at turn 42. We compute for each car the k_min and k_max.\n\nCar representation: (head, tail, direction, speed). Since all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-83, s=36.\n\nk_min = ceil( (-head) / s ) = ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) = 2\nk_max = floor( (-tail) / s ) = floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo only at k=2 (turn 44) is freeway 1 unsafe? Let me check:\n\nAt k=2: T=44.\nThe car: \n  head' = head + s*k = -48 + 36*2 = -48 + 72 = 24\n  tail' = tail + s*k = -83 + 72 = -11\nSo the span is [-11, 24]. 0 is in [-11,24] -> unsafe.\n\nAt k=1: \n  head' = -48+36= -12\n  tail' = -83+36= -47\n  span = [-47, -12] -> 0 not in.\nAt k=3: \n  head' = -48+108=60\n  tail' = -83+108=25\n  span=[25,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo indeed, only k=2.\n\nFreeway 2: same car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> same as freeway 1: unsafe only at k=2.\n\nFreeway 3: same: unsafe at k=2.\n\nFreeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24)\nk_min = ceil(48/24)=ceil(2)=2\nk_max = floor(71/24)=floor(2.958)=2\nSo unsafe only at k=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same -> unsafe at k=2.\nFreeway 6: same -> unsafe at k=2.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: \nCar1: (48,37,right,4)\n  head=48, tail=37, s=4\n  k_min = ceil(-48 / 4)? No: k_min = ceil( (-head)/s ) = ceil( (-48)/4 ) = ceil(-12) = -12 -> but k>=0, so we take max(0, ...). Actually, k_min = ceil( (-head)/s ) = ceil(-12) = -12 -> but k>=0, so the condition for head: head + s*k >=0 -> 48+4*k>=0 -> always true for k>=0. Similarly, tail+s*k<=0: 37+4*k<=0 -> 4*k<=-37 -> k<=-37/4 -> k<=-9.25 -> no nonnegative k. So this car never covers 0? \n\nBut wait: at k=0: the car is at [37,48] -> 0 not in.\nat k=1: [37+4,48+4]=[41,52] -> 0 not in.\nSo indeed, never unsafe.\n\nCar2: (12,1,right,4)\n  k_min = ceil(-12/4)=ceil(-3)= -3 -> but k>=0, so the head condition is always satisfied for k>=0? Actually, we have: head + s*k >=0 -> 12+4*k>=0 -> always true for k>=0.\n  k_max = floor( (-1)/4 ) = floor(-0.25) = -1 -> but k>=0, so the condition tail+s*k<=0: 1+4*k<=0 -> 4*k<=-1 -> no nonnegative k. So never unsafe.\n\nCar3: (-24,-35,right,4)\n  head=-24, tail=-35, s=4\n  k_min = ceil(24/4)=ceil(6)=6\n  k_max = floor(35/4)=floor(8.75)=8\n\n  So unsafe for k in [6,8].\n\nTherefore, freeway 7: unsafe only for k in [6,8] (from car3).\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: unsafe for k in [6,8].\n\nNow, freeways 1-6: unsafe only at k=2.\nfreeways 7-8: unsafe for k in [6,8].\n\nWe are at (y=0, k=0). We must go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as quickly as possible, but we must avoid:\n\n- On freeway 1 to 6: avoid being at k=2.\n- On freeway 7 and 8: avoid being at k in [6,8].\n\nSince we start at k=0 at y=0, we can choose:\n\nAt k=0 (turn42): we can go U to y=1 at k=1? But note: at turn42, we are at y=0. Then we choose an action. If we choose U, then at turn43 (k=1) we are at y=1.\n\nBut at y=1, we are at k=1. Freeway1 is unsafe at k=2, but at k=1 it is safe. So we can be at y=1 at k=1.\n\nThen at k=1 (turn43): we can choose U to go to y=2 at k=2.\n\nBut at y=2, at k=2: freeway2 is unsafe! So we cannot be at y=2 at k=2.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeways 1 to 6 at k=2.\n\nSimilarly, at freeways 7 and 8, we must avoid k in [6,8].\n\nSo we have to plan:\n\nOption 1: avoid being at freeways 1-6 at k=2.\n\nHow? We can either:\n- Be at a freeway <1 at k=2? But we are at y=0 at k=0. If we go up one step per turn, then:\n   k=0: y=0 -> action U -> k=1: y=1\n   k=1: y=1 -> action U -> k=2: y=2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at k=2)\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe could wait at y=0 for one turn: \n   k=0: at y=0, choose S -> k=1: still at y=0.\n   k=1: then choose U -> k=2: y=1.\n\nNow, at k=2, we are at freeway1. Is freeway1 unsafe at k=2? Yes! So we cannot be at freeway1 at k=2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at any freeway 1-6 at k=2.\n\nSo we must be at y<1 or y>6 at k=2? But we start at y=0 and we can only move one step per turn. At k=2, we can be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut y=0: safe (no cars). y=1: unsafe (freeway1). y=2: unsafe (freeway2). So we must be at y=0 at k=2.\n\nHow? \n   k=0: y=0 -> choose S (or D, but D would also keep at 0) -> then at k=1: y=0.\n   k=1: y=0 -> choose S -> then at k=2: y=0.\n\nThen at k=2: we are at y=0 (safe).\n\nThen at k=3: we can start moving up.\n\nBut note: we are at k=2 at y=0. Then at k=2, we choose U -> then at k=3: y=1.\n\nAt k=3: y=1 -> freeway1 is safe (because unsafe only at k=2). So we can be at y=1 at k=3.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go up:\n\nk=3: y=1 -> U -> k=4: y=2 (freeway2: safe because unsafe only at k=2)\nk=4: y=2 -> U -> k=5: y=3 (freeway3: safe)\nk=5: y=3 -> U -> k=6: y=4 (freeway4: unsafe at k=2, safe at k=6) -> safe.\nk=6: y=4 -> U -> k=7: y=5 (freeway5: safe at k=7)\nk=7: y=5 -> U -> k=8: y=6 (freeway6: safe at k=8)\n\nNow, at k=8: we are at y=6. Then we want to go to y=7 at the next step. But at k=8: freeway7 is unsafe? Because freeway7 is unsafe for k in [6,8]. So at k=8, freeway7 is unsafe. But note: if we choose U at k=8 (when we are at y=6), then we move to y=7 at k=9. However, during the move at k=8, we are on freeway6 (at k=8) and then we move to freeway7 at k=9.\n\nBut the collision condition: at the moment we are at freeway6 at k=8: we must check freeway6. Since freeway6 is safe at k=8 (because unsafe only at k=2), so we are safe.\n\nThen at k=8: we choose U -> then at k=9: we are at y=7.\n\nBut at k=9: we are at freeway7. Is freeway7 safe? Freeway7 is unsafe for k in [6,8]. At k=9, it is safe? Yes, because k=9 is beyond 8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: unsafe for k in [6,8], so at k=9 it is safe.\n\nSo we can proceed:\n\nk=8: at y=6, choose U -> k=9: y=7 -> safe (freeway7 at k=9 is safe)\nk=9: at y=7, choose U -> k=10: y=8 -> safe (freeway8 at k=10 is safe)\nk=10: at y=8, choose U -> k=11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the total turns: we start at k=0 (turn42) and we take actions until k=10 (the last action at k=10 leads to y=9 at k=11). But note: the last action is at turn 42+10 = 52, and then we are at y=9 at turn53. But we are to output the sequence of actions from turn42 to the last action that leads to y=9. The last action is at turn52 (k=10) which is the 11th action? \n\nLet me count the actions:\n\nk=0 (turn42): we do S (or D, but we did S twice and then started moving) -> actually, in the above plan:\n\nk=0: S (first action at turn42)\nk=1: S (action at turn43)\nk=2: S (action at turn44) -> we are still at y=0 at k=3? Actually, no: after the action at k=2 (turn44), we are at y=0 at k=3? \n\nWait, the state after the action:\n\nAt turn t (k=t-42):\n  We are at y_t.\n  Then we choose a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn42 (k=0): start at y=0.\n  Choose a_42: we choose S -> then at turn43 (k=1): y=0.\n\nTurn43 (k=1): at y=0, choose S -> then at turn44 (k=2): y=0.\n\nTurn44 (k=2): at y=0, choose S -> then at turn45 (k=3): y=0? But we wanted to move up at k=2 to be at y=1 at k=3.\n\nActually, we need to move at k=2: we are at y=0 at k=2 (after the action at k=2, we move to y=1 at k=3). But we want to be at y=1 at k=3. So at k=2 (turn44) we choose U.\n\nSo let me correct the plan:\n\nWe must be at y=0 at k=2. Then at k=2 (turn44), we choose U -> then at turn45 (k=3): we are at y=1.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn42 (k=0): at y=0 -> choose S -> then at k=1: y=0.\nTurn43 (k=1): at y=0 -> choose S -> then at k=2: y=0.\nTurn44 (k=2): at y=0 -> choose U -> then at k=3: y=1.\nTurn45 (k=3): at y=1 -> choose U -> then at k=4: y=2.\nTurn46 (k=4): at y=2 -> choose U -> then at k=5: y=3.\nTurn47 (k=5): at y=3 -> choose U -> then at k=6: y=4.\nTurn48 (k=6): at y=4 -> choose U -> then at k=7: y=5.\nTurn49 (k=7): at y=5 -> choose U -> then at k=8: y=6.\nTurn50 (k=8): at y=6 -> choose U -> then at k=9: y=7.\nTurn51 (k=9): at y=7 -> choose U -> then at k=10: y=8.\nTurn52 (k=10): at y=8 -> choose U -> then at k=11: y=9.\n\nSo we have 11 actions (from turn42 to turn52). H=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe could avoid waiting so long? We waited 2 turns (at k=0 and k=1) and then moved up. But we had to avoid freeways 1-6 at k=2.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y=0 and then at k=1, we are at y=1. Then at k=1, we cannot go to y=2 at k=2 (because unsafe). So we must avoid being at freeways 1-6 at k=2. But at k=1 we are at y=1 (freeway1). Then at k=1, we could choose D to go back to y=0 at k=2? \n\nThat is:\nk=0: y=0 -> U -> k=1: y=1.\nk=1: y=1 -> D -> k=2: y=0. (safe at k=2: y=0)\nThen k=2: y=0 -> U -> k=3: y=1.\n\nBut then we are at y=1 at k=3, which is safe. Then we can proceed as before.\n\nThis sequence:\n\nTurn42: U\nTurn43: D\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\n... and then same as before until turn52: U.\n\nBut we have to count: \nTurn42: U -> then at turn43: y=1.\nTurn43: D -> then at turn44: y=0.\nTurn44: U -> then at turn45: y=1.\nThen from turn45: U -> y=2 at turn46 -> then same as before.\n\nBut note: at turn46 (k=4): y=2 -> safe (freeway2 unsafe only at k=2). Then we go up each turn until we get to y=6 at turn50 (k=8): \nk=4: y=2 -> U -> k=5: y=3\nk=5: y=3 -> U -> k=6: y=4\nk=6: y=4 -> U -> k=7: y=5\nk=7: y=5 -> U -> k=8: y=6\n\nThen at k=8 (turn50): y=6 -> U -> k=9: y=7 (safe, because freeway7 unsafe only for k<=8? k=9 is safe) -> then same.\n\nTotal actions: from turn42 to turn52? \nBut we have:\n\nTurn42: U -> 1\nTurn43: D -> 0\nTurn44: U -> 1\nTurn45: U -> 2\nTurn46: U -> 3\nTurn47: U -> 4\nTurn48: U -> 5\nTurn49: U -> 6\nTurn50: U -> 7\nTurn51: U -> 8\nTurn52: U -> 9\n\nSo we have 11 actions? The same length.\n\nBut the last action at turn52 leads to y=9 at turn53. So H=11.\n\nBut is there a path with H=10? \n\nWe must get to y=9 at turn52 (which would be k=10). Then the last action is at turn51 (which would be the 10th action) and we are at y=8 at turn51 (k=9) and then we choose U to go to y=9 at turn52 (k=10). \n\nBut we must have been at y=8 at k=9. Is that safe? Freeway8 is unsafe for k in [6,8]. k=9 is safe. So yes.\n\nBut how do we get to y=8 at k=9? \n\nWe must start at y=0 at k=0. Then we need to go up 8 times and have two waits? \n\nWe have to avoid freeways 1-6 at k=2 and freeways7-8 at k in [6,8].\n\nWe can try:\n\nWe cannot be at freeways 1-6 at k=2, so at k=2 we must be at y=0 or y>=7? But at k=2, we can be at y=0,1,2 (if we move up twice) or we can be at y=0 (if we wait). We cannot be at y>=7 at k=2 because we start at y=0 and we can only move up 2 steps: so at k=2, we can be at y=0,1,2. \n\nSo we must be at y=0 at k=2.\n\nThen we start moving: at k=2: we choose U -> k=3: y=1.\nThen we need to go up 8 more steps to get to y=9 at k=11? That would be k=11. But we want to be at y=9 at k=10? How?\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the unsafe period at freeways7-8 by being at freeway7 and 8 at k<6 or k>8. \n\nBut to be at freeway7 (y=7) at k<=5: then we must get to y=7 by k=5. \n\nWe start at k=0: y=0.\nWe need to get to y=7 at k=5: that requires 7 moves in 5 steps? But we can only move one step per turn. The net displacement is 7, so we need at least 7 moves. But we have 5 steps? Then we must have 7 moves and 2 waits? That is 9 actions? Then we would be at y=7 at k=5? \n\nk=0: y0=0\nk=1: after action at k=0: we can be at y=0 or 1.\nWe need to be at y=7 at k=5 (which is after 5 actions: from k=0 to k=5, we have 5 actions). \n\nThe maximum we can go is 5 steps: so we can be at y=5 at k=5. Not 7.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 at k=5.\n\nWe can be at y=7 at k=9? Then we have time to go to y=9 at k=11. But that is 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at some freeway above 6? But we cannot get above y=6 until we pass freeways 1-6.\n\nWe could wait at y=0 until k=3? Then:\n\nk=0: S -> k=1: y0\nk=1: S -> k=2: y0\nk=2: S -> k=3: y0 -> then we start moving.\n\nBut then we are at k=3: y=0. Then we move up 9 times: we get to y=9 at k=12. That is 12 actions: worse.\n\nWe could move up to y=6 and then wait at y=6 until k=8 is over? But we are at freeway6 at k? We must avoid being at freeway6 at k=2? But we are at k>=3 when we get to y=6. And freeway6 is only unsafe at k=2, so safe at k>=3. So we can wait at y=6.\n\nBut if we wait at y=6 for one turn? Then we can avoid freeway7 at k=6,7,8? \n\nBut we can be at freeway6 at any k (except k=2) safely. So:\n\nWe want to be at y=7 at k=9 (so that freeway7 is safe). Then:\n\nWe need to get to y=6 by k=8? Then at k=8: we are at y=6. Then at k=8: we wait (choose S) -> then at k=9: we are still at y=6? Then we move to y=7 at k=10? Then we get to y=9 at k=12.\n\nAlternatively, at k=8: we are at y=6, and then we move to y=7 at k=9 (which is safe). So we don't need to wait at y=6. We did that in the first plan.\n\nBut to get to y=6 at k=8: \n\nWe start at k=0: y0=0.\nWe need to go up 6 steps (to y=6) in 8 turns? That means we have 8 actions: we must have 6 U and 2 S (or D, but D would not help). \n\nWe must avoid freeways 1-6 at k=2. So we must not be at freeways 1-6 at k=2. Therefore, we must be at y=0 at k=2.\n\nThen from k=3 to k=8: we have 6 actions? Then we can do 6 U and get to y=6 at k=8? \n\nk=0: S -> k=1: y=0\nk=1: S -> k=2: y=0\nk=2: U -> k=3: y=1\nk=3: U -> k=4: y=2\nk=4: U -> k=5: y=3\nk=5: U -> k=6: y=4\nk=6: U -> k=7: y=5\nk=7: U -> k=8: y=6\n\nThen k=8: y=6 -> U -> k=9: y=7\nk=9: y=7 -> U -> k=10: y=8\nk=10: y=8 -> U -> k=11: y=9\n\nThat is 11 actions.\n\nCan we do it in 10? We need to be at y=9 at k=10. Then we must be at y=8 at k=9 (so that by moving U we get to y=9 at k=10).\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at k=9. \n\nHow to get to y=8 at k=9?\n\nWe start at k=0: y0=0.\nWe need to go up 8 steps in 9 actions? That means we have 9 actions: we can have 8 U and 1 wait.\n\nBut we must avoid freeways 1-6 at k=2.\n\nWe can be at y=0 at k=0, then at k=0: we choose U -> k=1: y=1.\nThen at k=1: we must avoid being at freeways 1-6 at k=2. So at k=2 we must not be at y in [1,6]. But if we choose S at k=1: then at k=2: we are at y=1 -> unsafe.\nIf we choose D: then at k=2: we are at y=0 -> safe.\nSo:\n\nk=0: U -> k=1: y=1\nk=1: D -> k=2: y=0 (safe)\nThen at k=2: we are at y=0. Then we have 7 more actions to get to y=8 at k=9? \n\nFrom k=2 to k=9: 7 actions. We need to go from y=0 to y=8: 8 steps. But we have only 7 actions? We can only go up 7 steps: so we would be at y=7 at k=9, then we need one more U to get to y=8 at k=10, and then to y=9 at k=11.\n\nBut we want to be at y=8 at k=9. So we are short by one step.\n\nAlternatively, we use the wait at a later time? But we have to avoid k=2 for freeways1-6, and we also have to avoid freeways7-8 at k in [6,8]. \n\nSuppose we do:\n\nk=0: U -> k=1: y=1\nk=1: D -> k=2: y=0\nk=2: U -> k=3: y=1\nk=3: U -> k=4: y=2\nk=4: U -> k=5: y=3\nk=5: U -> k=6: y=4\n\nBut at k=6: we are at freeway4? It is safe (only unsafe at k=2). Then we continue:\n\nk=6: U -> k=7: y=5\nk=7: U -> k=8: y=6\n\nNow at k=8: we are at freeway6: safe? (unsafe only at k=2). Then we want to go to y=7 at k=9? But then we are at freeway7 at k=9: safe (because k=9>8). Then:\n\nk=8: U -> k=9: y=7\nk=9: U -> k=10: y=8\nk=10: U -> k=11: y=9 -> 11 actions.\n\nBut we are at k=9: y=7. Then we need two more steps to get to y=9.\n\nTo be at y=8 at k=9: we would have to be at y=7 at k=8? But at k=8, we are at y=6 (as above). Then we cannot jump two steps.\n\nAlternatively, we move faster earlier? But we have the constraint at k=2: we had to go down to y=0 at k=2. Then we only have from k=3 to k=9: 7 actions. We can do 7 U: then we get to y=7 at k=9. Then we need two more steps to get to y=9: so at least 9 more actions? Actually, from k=9: we do two U: then we get to y=9 at k=11. Total actions: from k=0 to k=10: 11 actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut note: we have freeways7-8 unsafe at k=6,7,8. In the above, we passed freeway7 at k=9 and freeway8 at k=10, which are safe.\n\nBut what if we try to be at freeway7 at k=5? Then we avoid the unsafe period. But we cannot get to y=7 at k=5: we only have 5 actions from k=0 to k=5: we must do at least 5 U to get to y=5 at k=5. Then we are at freeway5 at k=5: safe. Then we can go to freeway6 at k=6: safe. But then at k=6: we are at freeway6 (safe) and we want to go to freeway7 at k=7? But freeway7 is unsafe at k=6,7,8. So we cannot be at freeway7 at k=7.\n\nWe could wait at freeway6 for 3 turns? Then:\n\nk=5: y=5 -> then we do:\nk=5: S -> k=6: y=5\nk=6: S -> k=7: y=5\nk=7: S -> k=8: y=5\nk=8: U -> k=9: y=6\nk=9: U -> k=10: y=7\nk=10: U -> k=11: y=8\nk=11: U -> k=12: y=9 -> 12 actions: worse.\n\nSo the first plan is better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nWe have two sequences that work:\n\nSequence 1: wait twice at start (S, S) and then go up all the way.\n\nSequence 2: go up, then down, then up (U, D, then U...).\n\nBut both have 11 actions.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nI'll choose the first one: two waits at the beginning.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn42: S\nTurn43: S\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\nTurn47: U\nTurn48: U\nTurn49: U\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\n\nBut let me verify the freeways:\n\nAt turn42 (k=0): y=0 (safe) -> S -> turn43: y=0\nAt turn43 (k=1): y=0 -> S -> turn44: y=0\nAt turn44 (k=2): y=0 -> U -> turn45: y=1 -> at turn45 (k=3): we are at freeway1 -> safe? Because freeway1 unsafe only at k=2 -> yes safe.\nAt turn45 (k=3): y=1 -> U -> turn46: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (k=4? Actually, at turn46: k=4 -> safe)\nAt turn46: y=2 -> U -> turn47: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (k=5)\nAt turn47: y=3 -> U -> turn48: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (k=6)\nAt turn48: y=4 -> U -> turn49: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (k=7)\nAt turn49: y=5 -> U -> turn50: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (k=8) [freeway6 unsafe only at k=2 -> safe]\nAt turn50: y=6 -> U -> turn51: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn51, k=9 -> freeway7 unsafe for k in [6,8] -> k=9 is safe -> ok.\nAt turn51: y=7 -> U -> turn52: y=8 -> freeway8: k=10 -> safe.\nAt turn52: y=8 -> U -> turn53: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo it works.\n\nWe output the actions for turns 42 to 52.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTurn 42: S\nTurn 43: S\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn52, which leads to y=9 at turn53.\n\nIs there a sequence with 10 actions? We saw that we cannot. So this is minimal.\n\nWe could use the other sequence:\n\nTurn42: U\nTurn43: D\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\nTurn47: U\nTurn48: U\nTurn49: U\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\n\nThis also has 11 actions. \n\nBut the first one has two S at the beginning, the second has U then D. Both are valid.\n\nWe can choose either. I'll choose the first one.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: S\nTurn 43: S\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\n}\n\nBut note: in the second sequence, we have one less wait? Actually, both have the same number of waits: the first has two S, the second has one S (if we count D as a move that doesn't progress) and one extra move (the D). But the total number of actions is the same.\n\nWe'll stick with the first.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 42 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The cars on each freeway move at constant speeds, and their positions at any turn \\(T \\geq 42\\) are calculated based on their initial state at turn 42. Collision occurs if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) at turn \\(T\\) and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Unsafe Turns\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3**: Each has one car \\((-48, -83, \\text{right}, 36)\\).  \n  Unsafe at \\(k = T - 42 = 2\\) (i.e., turn 44). Safe at all other turns.\n- **Freeways 4, 5, 6**: Each has one car \\((-48, -71, \\text{right}, 24)\\).  \n  Unsafe at \\(k = 2\\) (turn 44). Safe at all other turns.\n- **Freeways 7, 8**: Each has three cars:  \n  - \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Always safe (no collision at any turn).  \n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Always safe.  \n  - \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Unsafe for \\(k \\in [6, 8]\\) (turns 48 to 50). Safe at \\(k \\geq 9\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 42 (\\(k = 0\\)). The goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) (safe) with minimal turns. The minimal path requires avoiding:\n- Freeways 1–6 at \\(k = 2\\) (turn 44).\n- Freeways 7–8 for \\(k \\in [6, 8]\\) (turns 48–50).\n\n### Optimal Path\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 11\\) (actions from turn 42 to turn 52). The sequence is:\n- **Turns 42–43 (k=0–1)**: Stay at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) to avoid being on freeways 1–6 at \\(k = 2\\).\n- **Turn 44 (k=2)**: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(k = 3\\) (turn 45). Although \\(k = 2\\) is unsafe for freeways 1–6, the player is still at \\(y = 0\\) during turn 44 (action execution), so no collision.\n- **Turns 45–50 (k=3–8)**: Move up consecutively to \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 7\\).  \n  - At \\(k = 3\\) (turn 45), \\(y = 1\\) is safe (freeway 1 unsafe only at \\(k = 2\\)).  \n  - Similarly, freeways 2–6 are safe at \\(k \\geq 3\\) (only unsafe at \\(k = 2\\)).  \n  - At \\(k = 9\\) (turn 51), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (freeway 7 unsafe only for \\(k \\leq 8\\)).\n- **Turn 51 (k=9)**: Move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(k = 10\\) (turn 52). Freeway 8 is safe at \\(k = 10\\).\n- **Turn 52 (k=10)**: Move to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(k = 11\\) (turn 53), reaching the goal.\n\nThis path avoids all unsafe freeway-turn combinations and achieves the goal in 11 turns, which is minimal (as paths with \\(H < 11\\) are impossible due to movement constraints and collision avoidance).\n\n### Action Sequence\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: S \\\\\nTurn 43: S \\\\\nTurn 44: U \\\\\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 44. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for each freeway at turn t_1=44. I need to find where these cars will be at future turns to avoid collisions. Collision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving, the player is only on the new row at the next turn, so if moving to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so cars on y_{T+1} at turn T don't affect them.\n\nLet me list out the car states for each freeway at t=44:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-83, -48]. At time t, position is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nAll directions are \"right\", so all are moving to the right.\n\nFreeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -83, direction right, speed s=36.\n\nSince direction is right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [-83 + 36(T - 44), -48 + 36(T - 44)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: head -48, tail -83, right, 36\n\nFreeway 3: same: head -48, tail -83, right, 36\n\nFreeway 4: head -48, tail -71, right, 24. So span at T: [-71 + 24(T - 44), -48 + 24(T - 44)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4: head -48, tail -71, right, 24\n\nFreeway 6: same: head -48, tail -71, right, 24\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nEach has its own span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same as 7: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nNow, the player is at y=0 at t=44. y=0 is not a freeway with cars; cars are on y=1 to 8. So at y=0, no cars, so it's safe. But the player needs to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways with cars are y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 are clear, no cars ever.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once there, it's fine.\n\nNow, to move from y=0 to y=9, the player needs to cross the freeways y=1 to 8. Each move changes y by at most 1, so minimum H would be 9 turns if moving up every turn, but might not be possible due to cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=44 to t=44+H-1, y should be 9.\n\nLet me denote t as turns after t_1. So at relative time t=0, which is turn t_1=44, y=0.\n\nAfter t turns, it's turn t_1 + t.\n\nAt time t (relative), the turn is t_1 + t, and position y_t.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H, and we want minimal H.\n\ny_t at time t relative.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nAfter first action, t=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nLet's see the player update:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t is applied, and y_{t+1} is the new position.\n\nIn terms of turns: at the start of turn t, position is y_t, then action a_t is chosen, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on current position y_t.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway k=y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe span is for the x-coordinate; since player is at x=0, collision if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNow, for freeways 1 to 3: cars with speed 36.\n\nAt time T (absolute), span for each car on freeway 1: [ -83 + 36(T - 44), -48 + 36(T - 44) ]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3.\n\nSince all three are identical, and freeway 1,2,3 have the same car, but different freeways, so when on y=1,2,3, we need to check for each separately.\n\nBut since the cars are the same, the dangerous times are similar.\n\nSimilarly for y=4,5,6 with speed 24 cars.\n\ny=4,5,6 have cars with head -48, tail -71, speed 24, so span at T: [ -71 + 24(T-44), -48 + 24(T-44) ]\n\nAnd y=7 and 8 have multiple cars with speed 4.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns T the car spans contain 0.\n\nBecause collision only if 0 is in the span at that turn for that row.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and time T, if the player is on row k at turn T, and for some car on that row, 0 is in [low, high] at T.\n\nSo for each row, I need the set of T where it is occupied at x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, the row y_t changes with t.\n\nNow, for freeways 1,2,3: same car type, so same occupation times.\n\nFor freeway k=1: car span at T: low = -83 + 36(T-44), high = -48 + 36(T-44)\n\n0 is in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -83 + 36(T-44) <= 0 <= -48 + 36(T-44)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36(T-44) <= 0 => 36(T-44) <= 83 => T-44 <= 83/36 = 2.305... so T-44 <= 2 since T integer? T is turn number, integer.\n\nT-44 <= floor(83/36) but inequality.\n\n36(T-44) <= 83, so T-44 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so since T-44 integer, T-44 <= 2.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36(T-44) => 48 <= 36(T-44) => T-44 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T-44 >= 2 since integer? T-44 >= ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's see.\n\n0 <= -48 + 36(T-44) => 48 <= 36(T-44) => T-44 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so since T-44 integer, T-44 >= 2.\n\nNow, first inequality: low <= 0: -83 + 36(T-44) <= 0 => 36(T-44) <= 83 => T-44 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-44 <= 2.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= high: 0 <= -48 + 36(T-44) => 36(T-44) >= 48 => T-44 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T-44 >= 2.\n\nNow, both: T-44 >= 2 and T-44 <= 2, so T-44 = 2.\n\nThus for freeway 1, occupied at x=0 only when T-44=2, i.e., T=46.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, exactly the same, so each has a car at x=0 only at T=46.\n\nNow for freeway 4: cars with tail -71, head -48, speed 24.\n\nSpan at T: [ -71 + 24(T-44), -48 + 24(T-44) ]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-71 + 24(T-44) <= 0 <= -48 + 24(T-44)\n\nFirst: -71 + 24(T-44) <= 0 => 24(T-44) <= 71 => T-44 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so T-44 <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 24(T-44) => 24(T-44) >= 48 => T-44 >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSo T-44 >= 2 and T-44 <= 2, so T-44=2, T=46.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same, so occupied at T=46 only.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars, each with speed 4.\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37, right, speed 4.\n\nSince right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 4(T-44), 48 + 4(T-44)]\n\nIn the car state, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the update: right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd since τ < h, it's increasing.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nSo for first car on freeway 7: h=48, τ=37, s=4, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 4(T-44), 48 + 4(T-44)]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 4(T-44) <= 0 <= 48 + 4(T-44)\n\nBut 37 + 4(T-44) is at least 37 - something, but T-44, since t1=44, T>44, T-44 >=0, so 37 + 4(T-44) >= 37 >0, so low end >=37>0, so 0 <= low is false, so 0 cannot be <= high if low >0. Since low >=37>0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low, high] for any T.\n\nSimilarly, high =48 +4(T-44) >=48>0, but low is also large, so 0 is always less than low, so never contains 0.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nHead 12, tail 1, so span at T: [1 + 4(T-44), 12 + 4(T-44)]\n\nLow =1 +4(T-44) >=1>0 for T>=44, so always low >=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nHead -24, tail -35? Tail τ=-35, head h=-24.\n\nSince moving right, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-35 + 4(T-44), -24 + 4(T-44)]\n\nNow, 0 in span if:\n\n-35 + 4(T-44) <= 0 <= -24 + 4(T-44)\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 4(T-44) <= 0 => 4(T-44) <= 35 => T-44 <= 35/4 = 8.75, so T-44 <= 8\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 + 4(T-44) => 24 <= 4(T-44) => T-44 >= 24/4 = 6\n\nSo T-44 >=6 and T-44 <=8, so T-44 =6,7,8\n\nThus for freeway 7, the third car occupies x=0 at T=44+6=50, T=44+7=51, T=44+8=52.\n\nT-44=6,7,8 so T=50,51,52.\n\nNow, similarly for freeway 8, same cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo same as freeway 7: occupied at x=0 only by the third car at T=50,51,52.\n\nNow, for freeways 1-6, they are occupied only at T=46, as we found.\n\nT=46 for all y=1,2,3,4,5,6 at that turn.\n\nBut for each row, only if player is on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, summary:\n\n- Row y=1: dangerous at T=46\n\n- Row y=2: dangerous at T=46\n\n- Row y=3: dangerous at T=46\n\n- Row y=4: dangerous at T=46\n\n- Row y=5: dangerous at T=46\n\n- Row y=6: dangerous at T=46\n\n- Row y=7: dangerous at T=50,51,52\n\n- Row y=8: dangerous at T=50,51,52\n\ny=7 and 8 dangerous at 50,51,52.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=44 (absolute T=44).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the dangerous times on each row.\n\nSince all rows 1-6 are dangerous only at T=46, and rows 7-8 dangerous at 50-52.\n\nPlayer at T=44, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up, but need to avoid being on a dangerous row at the dangerous time.\n\nFor rows 1-6, dangerous only at T=46, so if we are not on rows 1-6 at T=46, we are fine for those rows.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 7-8, dangerous at T=50,51,52, so avoid being on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nAlso, when moving, if we move to a new row at turn T, we are on the new row only at turn T+1, so at turn T, we are on the old row.\n\nLet's think about the sequence.\n\nLet t be relative time, t=0: T=44, y=0\n\nAction a_t at turn T=44+t, affects y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition y_t is at turn T=44+t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\ny_t is position at turn T=44+t.\n\nCollision check at turn T: based on y_T and car positions at T.\n\nFor row y, it is dangerous at certain T.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each turn, if y_t is between 1 and 8, then T is not a dangerous time for that row.\n\nSince dangerous times are specific.\n\nNow, y_t changes with t.\n\nStart t=0, T=44, y=0, safe since no cars.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe, so we can be there at any time.\n\nBut we need to arrive at y=9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, so we need y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to t=H, with y_H =9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn terms of relative t: actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, with y_t at time t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1} =9\n\nAnd y_H must be 9.\n\nNow, the turn when position is set: at turn T=44+t, position y_t is set, and action a_t is chosen.\n\nFor collision at turn T=44+t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and dangerous at that time.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, minimal H is 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible without collision.\n\nStart t=0, T=44, y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_0: if U, then y_1 =1 at T=45\n\nAt T=45, y=1, is it dangerous? For row 1, dangerous only at T=46, not at 45, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=2 at T=46, but at T=46, y=2, row 2 is dangerous at T=46, so collision.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption: always up.\n\nt=0, T=44, y=0, action U, so y_1=1 at T=45\n\nT=45, y=1: row 1 dangerous only at T=46, not 45, so safe.\n\nAction a_1: U, y_2=2 at T=46\n\nT=46, y=2: row 2 dangerous at T=46, collision! Not good.\n\nIf at t=1, T=45, y=1, we do S (stay), then y_2=1 at T=46, but at T=46, y=1, row 1 dangerous at T=46, collision.\n\nIf we do D, down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but we are going away from goal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nTo avoid row 1-6 at T=46, we need to not be on rows 1-6 at T=46.\n\nT=46 is absolute turn.\n\nAt T=46, we should be either at y=0, or y=7,8,9 or above, but y max 9, or below 1.\n\ny=0 or y=9 or perhaps y=7 or 8, but y=7 and 8 are dangerous at later times, not at T=46.\n\nAt T=46, only rows 1-6 are dangerous, rows 7-8 are safe at T=46.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=46, we need to be at y=0, or y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, we may not be there yet.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at T=44, we can delay or something.\n\nMinimal H: we need to cover from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up.\n\nBut we may need to wait or go down to avoid the dangerous time.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only dangerous at T=46, if we can be above or below at that time.\n\nFor example, at T=46, if we are at y=0 or y=7 or above.\n\ny=7 is row 7, which at T=46 is safe, since dangerous only at 50,51,52.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at 46.\n\nSo possible to be at y=7 at T=46, for example.\n\nThen we can proceed up.\n\nBut to reach y=7 by T=46.\n\nT=46 is 2 turns after start: T=44,45,46.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=2, T=44 to 46.\n\nAt t=0, T=44, y=0\n\nAfter two actions, y_2 at T=46.\n\nWe need y_2 =7 or 0 or 8 or 9.\n\nBut from y=0, in two moves, we can reach at most y=2 if both up, or y=1 if one up one stay, or y=0 if stay or down.\n\nCannot reach y=7 in two moves; max Δy=2, so y=2.\n\nBut y=2 at T=46 is dangerous.\n\ny=0 at T=46 is safe, but then we are at start, wasted time.\n\ny=1 at T=46 is dangerous.\n\nSo with always up, we get to y=2 at T=46, collision.\n\nIf we go up once and stay: at T=45, y=1, then at T=45 action S, y_2=1 at T=46, collision.\n\nIf we stay at start: at T=44, y=0, action S, y_1=0 at T=45, then at T=45, y=0, action U, y_2=1 at T=46, collision again.\n\nIf we go down: but y=0 min, cannot go below, so D at y=0, y stays 0.\n\nSo no way to be at y=0 or y=7+ at T=46 with only two moves from start.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on rows 1-6 at T=46.\n\nThat means at T=46, we must be at y=0 or y=7,8,9.\n\nBut from start, in 2 turns, we can only be at y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 is possible, but then we are behind.\n\ny=7 not possible.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 at T=46, which means we wasted time.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nBut rows 1-6 are safe except at T=46, so after T=46, we can go up through them safely.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 7-8, dangerous at 50,51,52.\n\nNow, let's find the minimal H.\n\nFirst, since we must be at y=0 at T=46 to avoid collision, or accept being on y=7+ but impossible.\n\nSo at T=46, y=0.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nStart: t=0, T=44, y=0, action? To be at y=0 at T=46.\n\nAt T=46, y=0.\n\nNow, from T=44 to T=46:\n\nAt T=44, action: if we do S or D, y_1=0 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, action S or D, y_2=0 at T=46.\n\nSo actions: at t=0, S or D (but D at y=0 does nothing, same as S), so effectively stay for two turns.\n\nThen at T=46, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nEach up move takes one turn.\n\nBut we have to pass through rows 1-8.\n\nRows 1-6 are now safe for all T except T=46, which is past, so after T=46, they are always safe? Not necessarily, but in this case, for rows 1-6, the cars are only at x=0 at T=46, and since they are moving, before and after, not at x=0.\n\nFor example, row 1: car at T=45: low = -83 +36(45-44) = -83+36= -47, high=-48+36= -12? T=45, T-44=1\n\nSpan: low = -83 +36(1) = -47, high = -48 +36(1) = -12, both negative, so 0 not in.\n\nT=47: T-44=3, low=-83+36*3=-83+108=25, high=-48+108=60, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for others, only at T=46 it is zero.\n\nSimilarly for rows 4-6, same, only T=46.\n\nSo after T=46, rows 1-6 are always safe to be on, since no car at x=0.\n\nNow rows 7-8 have dangerous times at T=50,51,52.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nNow, at T=46, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: 9 up moves, but we can do it in 9 turns from here.\n\nBut we have to time to avoid y=7,8 at T=50,51,52.\n\nNow, let’s go up as fast as possible from T=46.\n\nt relative from now, but let's use absolute T for clarity.\n\nSet T=46 as new start, but we have the delay.\n\nFrom T=46, y=0.\n\nAction at T=46: U, then at T=47, y=1\n\nT=47, y=1, safe (since row 1 safe after T=46)\n\nAction U, T=48, y=2\n\nSimilarly, continue up.\n\nT=48, y=2\n\nAction U, T=49, y=3\n\nT=49, y=3\n\nAction U, T=50, y=4\n\nNow T=50, y=4, row 4 safe.\n\nBut we are going to y=7 and 8 soon.\n\nT=50, y=4\n\nAction U, T=51, y=5\n\nT=51, y=5\n\nAction U, T=52, y=6\n\nT=52, y=6\n\nAction U, T=53, y=7\n\nNow T=53, y=7.\n\nBut row 7 dangerous at T=50,51,52, not at 53, so safe.\n\nThen action U, T=54, y=8\n\nT=54, y=8, row 8 dangerous at 50,51,52, not 54, safe.\n\nAction U, T=55, y=9, goal.\n\nSo we reached at T=55.\n\nNow, how many turns? From start T=44 to T=55, that's 11 turns? T=44 to T=55 is 12 positions, but turns: from turn 44 to turn 55, that's 12 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=44, y=0\n\nAfter actions up to turn 54, y at T=55=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions from a_{44} to a_{54}, and y_{55}=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=44 to t=54 inclusive, that's 11 actions? Indices.\n\nt_1=44.\n\nActions a_t for t from 44 to 44+H-1, and y_{44+H} =9.\n\nHere, after a_{54}, y_{55}=9, so 44+H =55, so H=11.\n\nH is number of turns, actions from a_{44} to a_{44+H-1}, and y_{44+H} =9.\n\nSet 44+H =55, so H=11.\n\nActions: a_{44} to a_{54}, 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, we had two stays at beginning? In this path, at T=44 and T=45, we did stay to be at y=0 at T=46.\n\nIn the path I described:\n\nAt T=44: we need to be at y=0 at T=46, so at T=44, action must be such that y at T=46 is 0.\n\nSince y_{46} depends on actions.\n\nAt T=44, y=0, if action S, then y_{45}=0\n\nThen at T=45, y=0, action S, then y_{46}=0\n\nThen at T=46, y=0, action U, y_{47}=1\n\nT=47, y=1, action U, y_{48}=2\n\nT=48, y=2, action U, y_{49}=3\n\nT=49, y=3, action U, y_{50}=4\n\nT=50, y=4, action U, y_{51}=5\n\nT=51, y=5, action U, y_{52}=6\n\nT=52, y=6, action U, y_{53}=7\n\nT=53, y=7, action U, y_{54}=8\n\nT=54, y=8, action U, y_{55}=9\n\nSo actions: at T=44: S (or D, same)\n\nT=45: S\n\nT=46: U\n\nT=47: U\n\nT=48: U\n\nT=49: U\n\nT=50: U\n\nT=51: U\n\nT=52: U\n\nT=53: U\n\nT=54: U\n\nAnd y at T=55=9.\n\nH=11, since actions from t=44 to t=54, that's 11 actions, and y_{55}=9.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe have to avoid T=46 for rows 1-6, but we were at y=0.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 or 8 at T=46, but impossible from start.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7-8 dangerous later, but we can pass through them before or after the dangerous times.\n\nIn the above, we passed y=7 at T=53 and y=8 at T=54, which are after T=52, so safe.\n\nBut T=53 and 54 are after 52, yes.\n\nNow, can we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we don't wait at start.\n\nBut earlier, if we go up immediately, we get stuck at T=46.\n\nUnless we can be at a safe row at T=46.\n\nBut y=7 or 8 at T=46 is safe, but we start at y=0, cannot reach y=7 in 2 moves.\n\nMinimal to y=7 is 7 moves, but in 2 moves, only y<=2.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nWe could go down, but y=0 min, cannot.\n\nSo we must spend at least two turns to stay at y=0 until T=46, or waste time elsewhere.\n\nBut staying at y=0 for two turns is the minimal waste.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=46, go up to y=9 in 9 turns, total 11 turns.\n\nBut at the end, we passed y=7 and 8 after T=52, so safe.\n\nBut we could go faster through the lower rows.\n\nFor example, after T=46, rows 1-6 are safe, so we can go up fast.\n\nIn the above, we did U every turn from T=46 to T=54, reaching y=9 at T=55.\n\nT=46 y=0, T=47 y=1, ..., T=55 y=9, that's 10 moves? From y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, but it takes 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at T=46, y=0\n\nAfter first U at T=46, y=1 at T=47\n\nAfter second U at T=47, y=2 at T=48\n\n...\n\nAfter ninth U at T=54, y=9 at T=55.\n\nYes.\n\nBut we had two S actions at the beginning.\n\nTotal actions: from T=44 to T=54, actions at 11 turns.\n\nThe turns when actions are taken: T=44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54.\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\ny at T=55=9.\n\nNow, H=11.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid the two waits by timing differently.\n\nFor example, if we go up slowly or something.\n\nSuppose at T=44, we go up to y=1 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, we are at y=1, which is safe since T=45 not dangerous for row 1.\n\nThen at T=45, if we go down, to y=0 at T=46.\n\nThen at T=46, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, go up from there.\n\nBut we used one U and one D, net zero progress, same as two S.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=46, go up.\n\nSame as before, H=11.\n\nIf we stay at T=44, then at T=45 y=0, then at T=45 we go up to y=1 at T=46, but at T=46, y=1, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=46 to avoid.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nBut we have to consider rows 7-8 dangerous times.\n\nIn the path above, we are at y=7 at T=53, which is after T=52, safe.\n\ny=8 at T=54, safe.\n\nBut could we be at y=7 or 8 earlier, before T=50?\n\nFor example, if we could reach y=7 by T=49, then we can go up.\n\nBut from start, to reach y=7 by T=49.\n\nT=49 is 5 turns after T=44.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=44, to y=7 at T=49.\n\ny at T=49.\n\nAfter actions from T=44 to T=48.\n\nAt T=44, action, y_45\n\n...\n\ny at T=49 is after actions up to T=48.\n\ny_{49} = y after action at T=48.\n\nTo have y_{49}=7.\n\nSince we start y_{44}=0, we need net +7 in 5 actions? Actions from T=44 to T=48, 5 actions.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo increase y by 7 in 5 actions, must have at least 7 U, but only 5 actions, impossible.\n\nMax y at T=49 is y_{44} + 5 = 5 if all U, or less.\n\nCannot reach y=7 by T=49.\n\nSimilarly, T=50: y_{50} could be up to 6.\n\nStill not 7.\n\nT=51: y_{51} up to 7.\n\nBut at T=51, if y=7, and T=51, row 7 dangerous at T=51, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach y=7 at T=50, row 7 dangerous at T=50, collision.\n\ny=7 at T=52, dangerous at T=52.\n\nOnly safe at T=53 or later for y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn our path, we have y=7 at T=53>52, safe.\n\ny=8 at T=54>52, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in the beginning, we have to wait two turns to avoid T=46.\n\nNow, for rows 7-8, since we are going up after T=46, and reach y=7 at T=53, which is fine.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier?\n\nSuppose we go up to y=1 at T=45, safe.\n\nThen at T=45, instead of going down, we stay at y=1, but at T=46, y=1 dangerous.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at T=46, dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no.\n\nSo we must not be on rows 1-6 at T=46.\n\nThus the waiting is necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 and y=9 are safe, we can stay at y=0 until after T=46, then go up.\n\nBut we have to handle rows 7-8.\n\nIn the path, we used 11 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on rows 7-8.\n\nFor example, at T=53, y=7, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the answer, we need the action sequence.\n\nIn the above, with two S at start.\n\nBut at T=44 and T=45, we do S, but since y=0, D also keeps y=0, same effect.\n\nIn the sequence, we can use S or D.\n\nBut S might be fine.\n\nNow, the actions: from turn t_1=44.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 44: action S (or D)\n\nTurn 45: action S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nAnd at turn 55, y=9.\n\nBut we have actions up to turn 54, and y at turn 55=9.\n\nNumber of actions: turns 44 to 54, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=44, H=11, so actions from t=0 to t=10, relative.\n\nAbsolute turns 44 to 54.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 44: a_{44}\n\nTurn 45: a_{45}\n\n...\n\nTurn 54: a_{54}\n\nWith actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 50, y=4, etc., all safe.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nSuppose we go down at some point, but that might not help.\n\nFor rows 7-8, we need to avoid T=50,51,52.\n\nIn our path, we are below during those times.\n\nAt T=50, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nT=51, y=5, safe.\n\nT=52, y=6, safe.\n\nThen T=53, y=7, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut if we could be above y=8 earlier, but we can't because of the initial delay.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to cover 9 levels, and we have to avoid one bad turn, which cost us two turns of waiting, so 11 seems minimal.\n\nWithout waiting, 9 turns, but impossible due to T=46.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the actions: in the sequence, at turn 44 and 45, we need to stay at y=0.\n\nWe can use action S.\n\nSimilarly, at other turns U.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, we have three cars, but only the one with negative positions was dangerous, but in our case, we avoided.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions are specified.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to output the actions for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=44.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 55, position (0,9), reached.\n\nNow, H=11.\n\nBut let's double-check if we can reduce H by going faster at the end or something.\n\nFor example, after T=46, we go up every turn, which is fastest.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before, but with waiting, it's delayed.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7-8 dangerous at 50-52, and we are going up from T=46, we reach y=4 at T=50, y=5 at T=51, y=6 at T=52, all below 7, so safe.\n\nThen y=7 at T=53, fine.\n\nIf we could be at y=7 earlier, but cannot due to the start.\n\nSuppose we do not wait at all, but at T=46, if we are at y=0, but we need to be there, so must have the S actions.\n\nPerhaps at T=44, we go up to y=1 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, we go down to y=0 at T=46.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut with U and D, instead of S and S.\n\nNet same.\n\nThen actions: Turn 44: U, Turn 45: D, Turn 46: U, etc.\n\nBut y at T=46 is 0, same.\n\nThen from there U to U.\n\nBut at Turn 45, we did D from y=1 to y=0.\n\nBut in terms of number of actions, same H=11.\n\nBut perhaps we can list it.\n\nBut S might be simpler.\n\nIn the sequence, all U after that.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nNow, but in the car for freeway 7 and 8, we have multiple cars, but only one is dangerous, and we avoided.\n\nNow, I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times again.\n\nFor rows 1-6: dangerous only at T=46.\n\nFor rows 7-8: dangerous at T=50,51,52.\n\nIn our path:\n\nAt T=46: y=0, safe\n\nT=47: y=1, safe (row 1 not dangerous)\n\nT=48: y=2, safe\n\n...\n\nT=49: y=3, safe\n\nT=50: y=4, safe\n\nT=51: y=5, safe\n\nT=52: y=6, safe (row 6 not dangerous at T=52)\n\nT=53: y=7, row 7 dangerous at 50,51,52, not 53, safe\n\nT=54: y=8, row 8 dangerous at 50,51,52, not 54, safe\n\nT=55: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the action sequence for turns 44 to 54.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 44: S Turn 45: S Turn 46: U Turn 47: U Turn 48: U Turn 49: U Turn 50: U Turn 51: U Turn 52: U Turn 53: U Turn 54: U }\n\nBut to write it properly.\n\nSince the player might move faster, but I think not.\n\nAnother thought: can we go to y=9 directly from below? No.\n\nPerhaps at some point we can skip a row by moving faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 54, action U, to y=9 at turn 55.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, about the cars on freeway 7 and 8: at T=50,51,52, if player were on y=7 or 8, collision, but we are not.\n\nFor example, at T=50, row 7 has car span: for the third car, at T=50, T-44=6, span [-35 +4(6), -24 +4(6)] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included? High = -24 + 24 =0, low=-35+24=-11.\n\nSo [ -11, 0], and 0 <= 0, so yes, 0 is included, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly at T=51: T-44=7, span [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=52: [-35+32, -24+32]=[-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=53: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nSo yes.\n\nIn our path, avoided.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, for turn 44 and 45, we used S, but we could use D, but S is fine.\n\nPerhaps to be precise.\n\nIn the output, it should be clear.\n\nNow, the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 44: S Turn 45: S Turn 46: U Turn 47: U Turn 48: U Turn 49: U Turn 50: U Turn 51: U Turn 52: U Turn 53: U Turn 54: U }\n\nBut let's write it with line breaks or something.\n\nIn the format, it says:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo for t_1=44.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nAnd that's for H=11, since actions up to turn 54, and position at turn 55 is (0,9).\n\nIf we want, we can have action at turn 55, but not needed, since we already at goal.\n\nThe sequence ends when we reach, so last action is at turn 54.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 44\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn.\n\n- Rows \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are dangerous only at turn \\(T = 46\\) because cars on these rows occupy \\(x = 0\\) only at that turn.\n- Rows \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous at turns \\(T = 50, 51, 52\\) due to the car with initial head \\(-24\\) and tail \\(-35\\) on these rows.\n\nTo avoid collision:\n- At \\(T = 46\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) since being on rows \\(1-6\\) would cause collision.\n- At \\(T = 50, 51, 52\\), the player must not be on rows \\(7\\) or \\(8\\), so the sequence keeps the player below row \\(7\\) during these turns.\n\nThe sequence starts with two \"S\" (stay) actions at turns 44 and 45 to remain at \\(y = 0\\) and avoid rows \\(1-6\\) at \\(T = 46\\). Then, from turn 46 onwards, the player moves up (\"U\") every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 55. This path ensures:\n- At \\(T = 46\\), \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- At \\(T = 50\\), \\(y = 4\\) (safe, below row 7).\n- At \\(T = 51\\), \\(y = 5\\) (safe, below row 7).\n- At \\(T = 52\\), \\(y = 6\\) (safe, below row 7).\n- At \\(T = 53\\), \\(y = 7\\) (row 7 is safe after \\(T = 52\\)).\n- At \\(T = 54\\), \\(y = 8\\) (row 8 is safe after \\(T = 52\\)).\n- At \\(T = 55\\), \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible because avoiding the collision at \\(T = 46\\) requires being at \\(y = 0\\) at that turn, which takes two turns from the start (turns 44 and 45). Going up directly would place the player on a dangerous row at \\(T = 46\\), causing collision. Thus, \\(H = 11\\) is minimal.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 44\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54\\text{: } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t_1 = 46 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to y=8, and they move horizontally. For each car, I have its position at turn t_1=46, given by head (h) and tail (τ), direction (left or right), and speed (s). The span is the interval where the car occupies the freeway.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and at that turn, for some car on that freeway, 0 is within its span. That is, if the player is at (0, y) at turn T, and y is a freeway (1-8), and there's a car on y with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T they are still on y_T, and at turn T+1 they are on y_{T+1}. So for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. So once we reach y=9, we're safe, and we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at t_1=46.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\n- y=1: car with head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-83, -48], and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-83 + 36(T-46), -48 + 36(T-46)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince t_1=46, let's define the time offset: let t = T - t_1, so at t=0, it's turn 46.\n\nThen for a car, at time t (relative), span for right-moving: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s*t, τ - s*t], but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, I think.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) — head is -48, tail is -83? That seems backward because if it's moving right, head should be the front, so if direction is right, and head is less than tail? Head -48, tail -83, since -48 > -83, so head is at -48, tail at -83, so the car spans from x=-83 to x=-48? But -83 is left, -48 is right, so if moving right, head should be at the right end, so head at -48, tail at -83, so the span is from left to right: tail to head, so [τ, h] = [-83, -48].\n\nYes, as per the update rule: for right-moving, span is [τ, h], and it becomes [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars: three each.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36\n\nAt relative time t, span: [ -83 + 36t, -48 + 36t ]\n\nCollision at time t if player is on y=1 and 0 in [ -83 + 36t, -48 + 36t ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: same as y=1: (-48, -83, right, 36), so same span: [ -83 + 36t, -48 + 36t ]\n\ny=3: same, [ -83 + 36t, -48 + 36t ]\n\ny=4: (-48, -71, right, 24), so [ -71 + 24t, -48 + 24t ]\n\ny=5: same as y=4, [ -71 + 24t, -48 + 24t ]\n\ny=6: same, [ -71 + 24t, -48 + 24t ]\n\nNow y=7: three cars:\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 4) — head 48, tail 37? Head 48, tail 37, since 48>37, so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nDirection is right, so span [37,48] at t=0.\n\nSecond car: (12, 1, right, 4) — head 12, tail 1, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 4) — head -24, tail -35, so since tail -35, head -24, and -24 > -35, so span [ -35, -24 ]\n\nAll moving right with speed 4.\n\nSo at relative time t, spans:\n\nCar1: [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\nCar2: [1 + 4t, 12 + 4t]\n\nCar3: [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same as y=7: three cars with same parameters, so same spans at time t.\n\nNow, player starts at (0,0) at t=0 (turn 46).\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer can move U, D, S each turn, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of turns, since we start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, the minimum possible is 9 turns if we go up every turn, but we might need to avoid collisions, so we might have to stay or move down sometimes, or wait.\n\nBut moving down might not help since we need to go up, but we could go down to avoid a car and then up, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince we need to go to higher y, probably best to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collisions only matter when we are on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0, no cars, so safe. y=9 no cars, safe.\n\nSo we need to pass through y=1 to 8, and at each turn when we are on one, it must not have a car at x=0.\n\nNow, since the cars move, the times when it's safe to be on each freeway depend on the car positions.\n\nMoreover, when we move, we are only on one y per turn.\n\nThe sequence: at turn T, we are at y_T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAt turn T, collision is based on y_T and the car spans at turn T.\n\nFor example, at t=0, player at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible. We can choose an action.\n\nIf we choose U, then at t=1, we move to y=1, and at that turn, we are on y=1, so we need no car on y=1 with 0 in span at t=1.\n\nSimilarly for other actions.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, and moves are small, we need to increase y step by step.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, if we can go up each turn without collision.\n\nBut let's see if that's possible.\n\nSo, can we go U every turn from t=0 to t=8? That would get us to y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut at each intermediate turn, when we are on y=1 to y=8, we need to check for collision.\n\nLet's list for each freeway and each time when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nFirst, for freeway y=1: car span [ -83 + 36t, -48 + 36t ]\n\n0 in this interval when:\n\n-83 + 36t <= 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nSo -83 + 36t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t <= 2 since t integer? t is relative time, integer turns.\n\nt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nSo -83 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 = 2.305, so for t <= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36t => 48 <= 36t => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so t >= 2 since t integer? t >= 2 because 1.333, ceil to 2? Let's see:\n\n0 <= -48 + 36t => 36t >= 48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so since t integer, t >= 2\n\nAnd from first, t <= 2.305, so t <= 2\n\nThus t=2\n\nAt t=2, both inequalities hold: -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 <=0, and -48 + 72 = 24 >=0? 0 <= 24 yes.\n\nAt t=1: -83 +36= -47 <=0 true, but 0 <= -48 +36 = -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not in span.\n\nAt t=2: -83+72= -11 <=0 true, -48+72=24 >=0 true, so 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nAt t=3: -83+108=25 >0, so not <=0, so 0 not in [25,60], no.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe only at t=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=2 and y=3, same car, so unsafe only at t=2.\n\nNow y=4: car [ -71 + 24t, -48 + 24t ]\n\n0 in span when:\n\n-71 + 24t <= 0 <= -48 + 24t\n\nFirst: -71 +24t <=0 => 24t <=71 => t <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so t <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +24t => 24t >=48 => t >= 2\n\nThus t=2\n\nAt t=2: -71+48= -23 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0, so 0 in [-23,0], yes.\n\nAt t=1: -71+24= -47 <=0 true, but 0 <= -48+24= -24? false.\n\nAt t=3: -71+72=1 >0, not <=0, so no.\n\nSo unsafe only at t=2.\n\nSimilarly y=5 and y=6 same, unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow y=7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\n0 in this? 37+4t to 48+4t, all positive since t>=0, min at t=0 is 37>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in this span. Safe from this car.\n\nSecond car: [1 + 4t, 12 + 4t]\n\n0 in this? 1+4t >=1 >0 for t>=0, so never <=0, always positive, so 0 not in span. Safe.\n\nThird car: [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\n0 in this when:\n\n-35 +4t <= 0 <= -24 +4t\n\nFirst: -35+4t <=0 => 4t <=35 => t <= 35/4 = 8.75, so t <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +4t => 4t >=24 => t >=6\n\nSo for t=6,7,8\n\nAt t=6: -35+24= -11 <=0, -24+24=0 <=0, so 0 in span.\n\nt=7: -35+28= -7 <=0, -24+28=4 >=0, yes\n\nt=8: -35+32= -3 <=0, -24+32=8 >=0, yes\n\nt=5: -35+20= -15 <=0, but 0 <= -24+20= -4? false\n\nt=9: -35+36=1 >0, not <=0\n\nSo unsafe when t=6,7,8 for the third car on y=7.\n\nBut there are three cars, but the first two never cause collision, so y=7 unsafe when third car has 0 in span, i.e., t=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same as y=7, unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when it is unsafe (collision possible):\n\n- y=1: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=4: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=6: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\n- y=8: unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\nAt other times, these freeways are safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 turns if always up.\n\nBut at t=2, all freeways y=1 to y=6 are unsafe. But y=1 to y=6 are different levels.\n\nThe player is at a specific y at each turn.\n\nIf we try to go up every turn:\n\nStart t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAction U: then at t=1, y=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1: is it safe? From above, y=1 unsafe only at t=2, at t=1 it is safe, since for y=1, unsafe only t=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, position y=1, which is freeway, and no car at x=0? For y=1, at t=1, span [ -83 +36*1, -48+36*1] = [-47, -12], 0 not in this, since -47 to -12, all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we can choose action, say U, then at t=2, y=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2: now y=2 is unsafe at t=2, as above.\n\nAt t=2, if y=2, then collision, since for y=2, car at [ -83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], 0 in this, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=2 we are on any y from 1 to 6, collision, because all unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=1 to y=6 all unsafe at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, if we are on y=7 or y=8, they are unsafe only at t=6,7,8, so at t=2, y=7 and y=8 are safe.\n\nBut we start from y=0, at t=0.\n\nAt t=0: y=0, safe. Action?\n\nIf we go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=1, safe as above. Action?\n\nIf we go U again, to y=2 at t=2, but at t=2 y=2 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at t=1 we stay S, then at t=2, y=1, but y=1 unsafe at t=2, collision.\n\nIf at t=1 we go down to y=0, but y=0 safe, but we are going down, which is away from goal.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=1 to y=6 at t=2.\n\nSince at t=2, all y=1 to6 are unsafe, we must not be on any of them at turn t=2.\n\nThat means at turn t=2, we must be on y=0, y=7, y=8, or y=9.\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=0.\n\nAfter one move, at t=1, we can be at y=0, y=1, or if we go down, but y=0 is min, so at t=1, possible y: 0 or 1.\n\nThen at t=2, from y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at t=1 y=0, then action: S or U (D not possible since y=0, but D would go to y=-1, but y>=0, so probably D not allowed at y=0, or it stays? The movement: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and choose D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, I assume, similarly at y=9, U keeps it 9.\n\nBut in terms of position, at y=0, choosing D effectively does nothing, same as S.\n\nBut the action is recorded, but position same.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for collision, at y=0, no issue.\n\nNow, back to t=1.\n\nIf at t=1 we are at y=0 (by choosing S or D at t=0), then at t=1 y=0, safe.\n\nThen action at t=1: we can choose U to go to y=1 at t=2, but at t=2 y=1 is unsafe.\n\nOr choose S to stay at y=0 at t=2.\n\nOr D, same as S.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 at t=2, safe, since y=0.\n\nBut then we need to go up later.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=1 we are at y=1 (by choosing U at t=0), then at t=1 y=1 safe, but if we choose any action, at t=2 we will be on y=0,1, or2.\n\nBut if we go to y=0 or y=2 or stay y=1, all except y=0 are unsafe at t=2? y=1 and y=2 unsafe, y=0 safe.\n\nBut at t=1, from y=1, if we choose D, we go to y=0 at t=2.\n\nIf we choose S, y=1 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nIf U, y=2 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only by choosing D at t=1, we can be at y=0 at t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we start by staying at t=0.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nNow, at t=2, we must not be on y=1-6, so we need to be at y=0,7,8,9.\n\nBut at t=2, we can only be at y=0 or y=1 if we start from y=0, since only two moves.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=2, after two actions, y can be from 0 to 2.\n\nSo possible positions at t=2: y=0,1,2.\n\nNone of which are 7,8,9 obviously.\n\nSo at t=2, we must be at y=0 to be safe, since y=1 and y=2 are unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid collision at t=2 is to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nHow to achieve that.\n\nAt t=0: y=0\n\nChoose action:\n\n- If choose U: at t=1 y=1\n\nThen at t=1, must choose D to go to y=0 at t=2.\n\n- If choose S or D: at t=1 y=0\n\nThen at t=1, choose S or D to stay at y=0 at t=2.\n\nSo in both cases, we end up at y=0 at t=2, and we have used two turns to stay at y=0, which is not progress.\n\nBut we avoided collision.\n\nNow, after t=2, we can start moving up.\n\nt=2 is safe at y=0.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=2, y=0.\n\nNow, we need to go through y=1 to 8.\n\nBut there is another problem at later times: y=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nt is relative to t_1=46, so t=0 is turn 46, t=1 turn 47, etc.\n\nAt t=2, it's turn 48.\n\nNow, after t=2, the freeways y=1-6 are safe except at t=2, which is passed.\n\nFor y=1, unsafe only t=2, similarly others.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 relative to t_1=46, so turns 52,53,54 if t_1=46.\n\nt=0: turn 46\n\nt=1: 47\n\nt=2: 48\n\n...\n\nt=6: turn 52\n\nt=7: 53\n\nt=8: 54\n\netc.\n\nNow, from t=2, y=0, we can start moving up.\n\nWe need to be careful when we are on y=7 and y=8, avoid t=6,7,8.\n\nBut t=6,7,8 are specific times.\n\nNow, since we start from y=0 at t=2, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, so from t=2, if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=2, y=0\n\nt=3, y=1\n\nt=4, y=2\n\nt=5, y=3\n\nt=6, y=4\n\nt=7, y=5\n\nt=8, y=6\n\nt=9, y=7\n\nt=10, y=8\n\nt=11, y=9\n\nNow, at each step, we need to check if on freeway and collision.\n\ny=1 at t=3: is it safe? For y=1, unsafe only at t=2, t=3 is fine, span [ -83 + 36*3, -48 + 36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 at t=4: same, [ -83+36*4, -48+144] 36*4=144, -83+144=61, -48+144=96, [61,96], no 0.\n\nSimilarly all y=1 to6 safe for t>2.\n\nNow at t=9, y=7: y=7 is freeway, and at t=9, is it unsafe?\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=6,7,8, but t=9 is later.\n\nAt t=9, for y=7, the cars:\n\nThird car span at t: [-35+4t, -24+4t]\n\nAt t=9: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], both positive, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars safe.\n\nAt t=10, y=8: similarly, at t=10, for y=8 cars, same as y=7, span for third car: [-35+4*10, -24+40] = [5,16], no 0, safe.\n\nThen t=11, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=3 to t=11, all safe, no issues.\n\nBut we started at t=0, and at t=2 we are at y=0, then from t=2 to t=11, we go to y=9 in 9 turns, so total turns from start: t=0 to t=11, that's 12 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t, for t=0,1,2,... \n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn terms of relative time.\n\nAt relative time t=0: position before any action, at turn t_1.\n\nAfter first action, at t=1, position updated.\n\nAfter k actions, at time t=k, position y_k.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=0: y=0\n\nAfter action at t=0: we need to choose actions to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nOptions:\n\nOption 1: at t=0, choose S (or D, same effect), so at t=1, y=0\n\nThen at t=1, choose S (or D), so at t=2, y=0\n\nOption 2: at t=0, choose U, so at t=1, y=1\n\nThen at t=1, choose D, so at t=2, y=0\n\nIn both cases, at t=2, y=0.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=11, go up every turn.\n\nt=2: y=0, action U, to y=1 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=4\n\n...\n\nup to t=10: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=11\n\nAt t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, total actions: from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions? Let's list the actions.\n\nActions are chosen at each turn, starting from turn t_1.\n\nAt turn relative t: we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}\n\nThe position is after the action.\n\nIn the game dynamics:\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nCollision at turn t based on y_t and cars at turn t.\n\nThen after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, with y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn this case, start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=H, y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=2, we can have:\n\nSequence A:\n\nt=0: choose S, so y_{1} = y_0 + 0 =0 (since at t=0 action, y_{1} is set)\n\nAfter action at t=0, position at t=1 is y_1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt turn t=0 (relative): position y_0 =0\n\nChoose a_0: if S, then y_1 =0\n\nThen at turn t=1: position y_1=0, choose a_1: S, then y_2=0\n\nNow at turn t=2: position y_2=0, now we need to go up.\n\nChoose a_2: U, then y_3=1\n\nt=3: y_3=1, choose U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nt=10: y_10=8, choose U, y_11=9\n\nSo at t=11, y_11=9, so we reached after 11 actions, from t=0 to t=10, H=11 actions.\n\nt=0 to t=10, that's 11 steps? From action index.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at time t=11, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, the other sequence:\n\nt=0: choose U, so y_1 =1\n\nt=1: position y_1=1, choose D, so y_2 =1 + (-1) =0\n\nThen t=2: y_2=0, same as before.\n\nThen proceed up: a_2=U, y_3=1, etc., same as above, to y_11=9.\n\nNow, in both cases, H=11.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nFor example, can we reach earlier?\n\nSince at t=2 we must be at y=0, and from there to y=9 takes at least 9 turns, so minimum 11 turns from start.\n\nBut at t=2 we are at y=0, which is after two actions, but we have made two actions to stay or go down, not progress.\n\nPerhaps we can be at higher y at t=2, but earlier we saw that only y=0 is possible at t=2, since y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nBut y=7 or 8 are possible? But at t=2, from start, we can only reach up to y=2, not y=7.\n\nSo no, must be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, when we go up from t=2, we pass y=7 at t=9 and y=8 at t=10, which are after t=8, so safe, as we saw.\n\nt=9>8, safe.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two choices for the first two actions.\n\nTo minimize H, both lead to H=11.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving up after t=2 but faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we can skip some levels, but no, must move step by step.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before t=11.\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately, but at t=2 we have problem.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, we go up to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, instead of going down, we stay or something, but if at t=1 we stay at y=1, then at t=2 y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nNo choice but to go down or stay at y=0.\n\nSo must lose two turns.\n\nPerhaps later we can go faster, but from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 turns, so 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn the plan, we are on y=7 at t=9, which is safe, and y=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 or y=8 at different times to avoid the unsafe period.\n\nFor example, if we delay or advance.\n\nBut in this case, since we start from y=0 at t=2, the earliest we can be at y=7 is t=9, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=10.\n\nIf we go slower, it might be later, but not better.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster initially but we can't because of t=2 constraint.\n\nAnother thought: at t=0, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nIf we do nothing for one turn, at t=1 y=0, then at t=1, we can go to y=1, but at t=2, if we are on y=1, unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on y=1 at t=1 and then move to y= something else at t=2, but only to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0 at t=2, but then start moving.\n\nBut we need to consider if we can reach earlier by being at higher y at t=2, but impossible.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nNow, in the action sequence.\n\nWe need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=46.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn 46: a_{46}, Turn 47: a_{47}, etc.\n\nNow, for the actions, we have flexibility in the first two actions, as long as we end at y=0 at relative t=2.\n\nOption 1: all stay or down, but down at y=0 same as stay.\n\nSince at y=0, D and S both keep y=0.\n\nBut the action might be different, but position same.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be simple, we can choose S for both.\n\nOr U then D.\n\nBut U then D might look inefficient, but it's fine.\n\nSince we need minimal H, and both same, we can choose one.\n\nIn the sequence, after that, we go up.\n\nIn the output, we need to list actions until we reach.\n\nIn this case, actions from turn 46 to turn 56? Let's see.\n\nRelative t=0: turn 46\n\nt=1: turn 47\n\n...\n\nt=10: turn 56\n\nAfter action at t=10, y_{11} =9 at turn 57? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T (absolute), position y_T.\n\nTurn t_1 =46: y=0\n\nAfter action a_{46}, y_{47} is set.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9, so at turn 46 + H, position=9.\n\nIn sequence:\n\nStart turn 46: y=0\n\nChoose a_{46}: say S, then y_{47} =0\n\nTurn 47: y=0, choose a_{47}: S, then y_{48} =0\n\nNow turn 48: y=0 (since at turn 48, position is y_{48}=0)\n\nIn relative, at t=2 (turn 48), y=0.\n\nThen choose a_{48}: U, so y_{49} =1\n\nTurn 49: y=1, choose U, y_{50}=2\n\nTurn 50: y=2, choose U, y_{51}=3\n\nTurn 51: y=3, choose U, y_{52}=4\n\nTurn 52: y=4, choose U, y_{53}=5\n\nTurn 53: y=5, choose U, y_{54}=6\n\nTurn 54: y=6, choose U, y_{55}=7\n\nTurn 55: y=7, choose U, y_{56}=8\n\nTurn 56: y=8, choose U, y_{57}=9\n\nNow at turn 57, y=9, reached.\n\nH is the number of actions, from turn 46 to 56, that's 11 actions? Turns: 46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56: that's 11 turns for actions, and after last action, at turn 57 position is 9.\n\nTurn 46: first action, after which position at turn 47.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nHere, after 11 actions (turns 46 to 56), position at turn 57 is 9.\n\nSince we start at turn 46 position, and after H actions, at turn 46+H position.\n\nWe need turn 46+H position to be 9.\n\nIn this case, turn 57 = 46 + 11, so H=11.\n\nWith the other sequence:\n\nTurn 46: choose U, then y_{47}=1\n\nTurn 47: y=1, choose D, then y_{48}=1-1=0\n\nThen turn 48: y=0, same as above, then U to y_{49}=1, and so on, same, up to turn 56: choose U, y_{57}=9.\n\nSame H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go from y=6 to y=7 at turn 55 to 56? In above:\n\nAt turn 54: y=6? Let's list absolute turns.\n\nTurn 46: start y=0\n\nAfter a46: if S, y47=0\n\na47: S, y48=0\n\na48: U, y49=1\n\na49: U, y50=2\n\na50: U, y51=3\n\na51: U, y52=4\n\na52: U, y53=5\n\na53: U, y54=6\n\na54: U, y55=7\n\na55: U, y56=8\n\na56: U, y57=9\n\nActions from turn 46 to 56, 11 actions, position at 57 is 9.\n\nNow, at which points are we on freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn 49: y=1, which is freeway, time relative: from t_1=46, turn 49 is t=3? Absolute turn T, relative t = T - t_1 = T - 46.\n\nAt turn 49, t=49-46=3, y=1, which is safe as before.\n\nSimilarly, turn 50: t=4, y=2, safe.\n\n...\n\nTurn 55: t=55-46=9, y=7\n\nNow, y=7 at t=9, which is safe, as cars: for y=7, third car span at t=9: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], no 0.\n\nSimilarly turn 56: t=10, y=8, span [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nIn the first two actions, if we choose U then D:\n\nTurn 46: U, y47=1\n\nTurn 47: D, y48=0\n\nThen same from turn 48.\n\nAt turn 47: when we are at y=1, t=1 (relative), which is safe, as we checked.\n\nThen at turn 47, we choose D, go to y=0 at turn 48.\n\nNo collision.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence with S,S or U,D, both work.\n\nTo make it simple, perhaps choose S for both, so no down move.\n\nSince the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both are same, we can choose.\n\nNow, but H=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn 56.\n\nThat means at turn 56, position=9.\n\nTurn 56 = t_1 + H, t_1=46, so 46 + H =56? H=10.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 56, y=9.\n\nBut to go from y=0 to y=9 in 10 actions, it requires exactly 9 up moves and possibly one stay or down, but since we need net +9, we must have exactly 9 up moves and no down, or 10 up but y=9 max, so if we have extra up, it stays at 9.\n\nBut minimal actions: since we need to increase y by 9, we need at least 9 up moves.\n\nWith 10 actions, we can have 9 up and one stay, or 10 up but after y=9, U keeps it 9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at some point.\n\nFor example, if we go up every turn from start, we reach y=9 at turn 55? Start turn 46 y=0.\n\nAfter a46 U, y47=1\n\na47 U, y48=2\n\nBut at turn 48, if y=2, t=2 relative, collision since y=2 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we delay the up moves.\n\nSuppose at t=0, S, y47=0\n\nt=1, U, y48=1, but at turn 48, y=1, t=2, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=0 U, y47=1\n\nt=1 S, y48=1, still at y=1, t=2 unsafe.\n\nt=1 D, y48=0, safe but at y=0.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9 at turn 56.\n\nAt turn 48 y=0\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at turn 56.\n\nFrom turn 48 to turn 56, that's 8 turns: 48 to 56 actions? Actions at turn 48 to 55, 8 actions, positions from y49 to y56.\n\nAt turn 48: y=0\n\nAfter a48, y49\n\n...\n\nAfter a55, y56\n\nWe need y56=9.\n\nWith 8 actions from y=0, we can reach at most y=8 if all U, but y=8 at y56, not 9.\n\nFor example:\n\na48 U, y49=1\n\na49 U, y50=2\n\n...\n\na54 U, y55=7? Turn 48 action to y49, turn 49 to y50, ..., turn 54 to y55, turn 55 to y56.\n\nFrom turn 48 to turn 55: actions at 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55: that's 8 actions.\n\nAfter a48, y49=1\n\na49, y50=2\n\na50, y51=3\n\na51, y52=4\n\na52, y53=5\n\na53, y54=6\n\na54, y55=7\n\na55, y56=8\n\nSo y56=8, not 9.\n\nIf we want y56=9, we need one more up, but no more actions.\n\nAfter a55, y56=8, to have y56=9, it must be that at turn 55, y=8, and we choose U, but turn 55 action sets y56.\n\nTo have y56=9, we need at turn 55, y=8 or 9, and choose U or S.\n\nBut from above, with 8 actions from y=0, we can only reach y=8 at y56.\n\nThus, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 actions from y=0.\n\nIn our case, from turn 48 y=0, to turn 57 y=9 with 9 actions: a48 to a56.\n\nSimilarly, from start, with the two initial \"wasted\" actions, we have H=11.\n\nIf we can be at y=1 at turn 48, for example.\n\nBut at turn 48, if we are at y=1, it must be from previous, but at turn 48, t=2 relative, if y=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSimilarly, any y=1-6 at t=2 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn 48 (t=2).\n\nThen minimum to y=9 takes 9 more actions, total 11 actions.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for y=7 and y=8, we have multiple cars, but in our sequence, we pass at safe times.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nLet's choose a sequence, say with S for the first two.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 46: S\n\nTurn 47: S\n\nThen\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nAfter Turn 56 action U, position at turn 57 is 9.\n\nIn the action list, the last action is at turn 56.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from turn 46 to turn 56.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nWith U and D:\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: D\n\nTurn 48: U\n\n...\n\nSame from turn 48.\n\nBut turn 47 D, which is down, but since y=1, it goes to 0.\n\nBut in terms of action, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps S,S is simpler.\n\nNow, in the output format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns, which is 11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can avoid the two wasted turns by being on y=7 or y=8 at t=2, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are safe at t=2, if we could be there, but from y=0, we can't reach in two moves.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 46\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Constraint at \\(t = 2\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\)):** At relative time \\(t = 2\\) (turn 48), all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe due to cars spanning \\(x = 0\\). Therefore, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 48 to avoid collision, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars.\n- **Later Constraints:** Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at relative times \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\) (turns 52, 53, 54). However, in the planned sequence, the player is on \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 9\\) (turn 55) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 10\\) (turn 56), which are safe.\n- **Minimal Turns:** Starting from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 46, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 48. From there, it takes exactly 9 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) by moving up each turn, as each move increases \\(y\\) by 1. Thus, the minimal number of actions \\(H\\) is 11, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 57.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- The first two actions ensure the player is at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 48 (relative \\(t = 2\\)) to avoid collision. Choosing \"S\" (stay) for both actions is straightforward and avoids unnecessary down moves.\n- From turn 48 onward, the player moves up (\"U\") every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for turns 46 to 56 (11 actions) is:\n\n- Turn 46: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\), position at turn 47 is (0, 0)\n- Turn 47: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\)), position at turn 48 is (0, 0)\n- Turn 48: U (move to \\(y = 1\\)), position at turn 49 is (0, 1)\n- Turn 49: U (move to \\(y = 2\\)), position at turn 50 is (0, 2)\n- Turn 50: U (move to \\(y = 3\\)), position at turn 51 is (0, 3)\n- Turn 51: U (move to \\(y = 4\\)), position at turn 52 is (0, 4)\n- Turn 52: U (move to \\(y = 5\\)), position at turn 53 is (0, 5)\n- Turn 53: U (move to \\(y = 6\\)), position at turn 54 is (0, 6)\n- Turn 54: U (move to \\(y = 7\\)), position at turn 55 is (0, 7)\n- Turn 55: U (move to \\(y = 8\\)), position at turn 56 is (0, 8)\n- Turn 56: U (move to \\(y = 9\\)), position at turn 57 is (0, 9)\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **At turn 48 (\\(t = 2\\)):** Player is at \\(y = 0\\), which has no cars, so no collision.\n- **Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\):** Unsafe only at \\(t = 2\\), but the player is on these freeways at turns 49-54 (\\(t = 3\\) to \\(t = 8\\)), which are safe (e.g., for \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 3\\), car span is [25, 60], excluding 0).\n- **Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\):** Unsafe at \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\) (turns 52-54), but the player is on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 55 (\\(t = 9\\)) and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 56 (\\(t = 10\\)), which are safe (e.g., for \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 9\\), car spans are [41, 52], [37, 48], and [1, 12], all excluding 0).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 11\\) turns, which is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 48 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving left or right on each freeway. For collision, it only matters if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car spans include x=0. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only care about collisions at the position where I am during that turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn 48, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their states at turn 48.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail tau=-83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, the span is [tau, h] = [-83, -48] at t=48. For future turn T, span is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-83 + 36(T-48), -48 + 36(T-48)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same as freeway 1: [-83 + 36(T-48), -48 + 36(T-48)]\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: head -48, tail -71, right, speed 24. So span at T: [-71 + 24(T-48), -48 + 24(T-48)]\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n\n1. (48, 37, right, 4) — head 48, tail 37, right, speed 4. Since right, span is [tau, h] = [37,48] at t=48. At T: [37 + 4(T-48), 48 + 4(T-48)]\n\n2. (12, 1, right, 4) — head 12, tail 1, right, speed 4. Span: [1 + 4(T-48), 12 + 4(T-48)]\n\n3. (-24, -35, right, 4) — head -24, tail -35, but direction right, so span should be [tail, head] = [-35, -24] at t=48. At T: [-35 + 4(T-48), -24 + 4(T-48)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, when I'm on freeway k, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 48. y=0 is not a freeway, it's the bottom, so no cars there. I need to move up to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, also no freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so when I'm at y=9, I'm done, no collision possible.\n\nBut during the path, when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid times when a car is covering x=0 on that row.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, min turns is at least 9, if I go up every turn. But I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nStart at turn 48, y=0.\n\nTurn 48: I'm at (0,0), no action yet? The actions start from t=48.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, where t1=48.\n\nSo at turn t1 + t, action a_{t1+t} determines y_{t1 + t +1}, I think.\n\nLet's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, I am at position y_t.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if I am at y_T on a freeway, and if 0 in car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nTurn T means the time when I am at position y_T.\n\nStart: at turn 48, I am at y=0. Since y=0 not freeway, no collision possible.\n\nI choose a_{48}, which will move me to y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy_{48}.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, I move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose action a_t, which affects where I will be at turn t+1.\n\nFor collision at turn t: if y_t is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that freeway at turn t with 0 in its span.\n\nIn this case, at turn 48, y=0, not freeway, so no collision.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is also not freeway, so when I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nI need to pass through y=1 to 8 without being hit.\n\nNow, min H such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\ny_{t1} = 0\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1 + H} = 9\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=48 to t=48+H-1, so H actions, and y_{48+H} = 9.\n\ny_{t} at time t.\n\ny_{48} = 0\n\nAfter first action a_{48}, y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy_{48}\n\nAfter second action a_{49}, y_{50} = y_{49} + Δy_{49} = (y_{48} + Δy_{48}) + Δy_{49}\n\nSo after k actions, y_{48+k} = y_{48} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{48+i}\n\nSince y_{48} = 0, y_{48+k} = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{48+i}\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, and y must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nWe want y_{48+H} = 9, so sum of H terms of Δy must be 9, each in {-1,0,1}, so min H is 9, with all Δy=1, meaning all actions U.\n\nBut may not be possible due to cars.\n\nI need to check for each freeway, when it is safe to be there, i.e., when 0 is not in any car span on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k and turn T, whether it is occupied at x=0.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find when each car covers x=0.\n\nThen for each row, I can find the times when it is unsafe.\n\nThen I need a path from turn 48, y=0 to some turn when y=9, with y changing slowly.\n\nSince min time is 9 turns if no cars, but with cars, I might need to wait or detour, but I can only move vertically, so no horizontal detour, only vertical, and I can stay or move up/down.\n\nSo essentially, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, spending at least one turn on each y from 1 to 8, but I can stay multiple turns or move down, but since I need to increase y, moving down might not help, but I might need to avoid certain times.\n\nSince I start from below and go up, and cars are moving, I need to time when I cross each row.\n\nBut I can stay on a row for multiple turns if I want, but that might not be efficient.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the set of turns when it is safe to be there.\n\nDefine the safe sets.\n\nStart from freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car with span at T: [ -83 + 36(T-48), -48 + 36(T-48) ]\n\nThis is for right-moving, so [tail + s(T-48), head + s(T-48)] = [-83 + 36(T-48), -48 + 36(T-48)]\n\n0 is in span if -83 + 36(T-48) <= 0 <= -48 + 36(T-48)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, solve inequality:\n\nLower bound L = -83 + 36(T-48)\n\nUpper bound U = -48 + 36(T-48)\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <= 0 and U >= 0.\n\nBut L and U are positions, and for right-moving, L is tail, U is head, so if L <= U, which it should be.\n\n-83 + 36(T-48) <= -48 + 36(T-48) always true since -83 < -48.\n\nSo 0 in [L,U] if L <= 0 and U >= 0.\n\nSo L <= 0: -83 + 36(T-48) <= 0\n\n36(T-48) <= 83\n\nT-48 <= 83/36 = 2.3055, so T-48 <= 2 since T integer.\n\nSimilarly, U >= 0: -48 + 36(T-48) >= 0\n\n36(T-48) >= 48\n\nT-48 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T-48 >= 2 since T integer? Let's see.\n\nT-48 >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? No.\n\nU >=0: -48 + 36(T-48) >=0\n\n36(T-48) >=48\n\nDivide both sides by 12: 3(T-48) >=4\n\nT-48 >= 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T-48 >= 2 since T integer? T-48 is integer, so T-48 >= 2.\n\nSimilarly, L <=0: -83 + 36(T-48) <=0\n\n36(T-48) <=83\n\nT-48 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.3055, so T-48 <= 2 since integer.\n\nT-48 <= floor(2.3055) = 2? Let's see.\n\nT-48 <= 83/36 = 2.305, so T-48 <= 2 because if T-48=3, 36*3=108>83, L= -83+108=25>0, so L<=0 only if T-48 <=2.\n\nU >=0: -48 + 36(T-48) >=0\n\n36(T-48) >=48\n\nT-48 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-48 >= 2? If T-48=1, U= -48 +36*1 = -12 <0, not >=0.\n\nT-48=2, U= -48 + 72 = 24 >=0, yes.\n\nT-48=2, L= -83 + 72 = -11 <=0, yes.\n\nSo for T-48=2, L=-11<=0, U=24>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nNow T-48=1: L= -83 +36*1 = -47 <=0, U= -48 +36= -12 <0, so U<0, not >=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nT-48=3: L= -83 +108=25>0, U= -48+108=60>0, so L>0, not <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for other T.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only when T-48=2, i.e., turn T=50.\n\nT=50.\n\nSimilarly, since freeway 2 and 3 are identical, same car, so also unsafe at T=50.\n\nNow freeway 4: head -48, tail -71, right, speed 24.\n\nSpan at T: [ -71 + 24(T-48), -48 + 24(T-48) ]\n\n0 in span if L <=0 and U>=0.\n\nL = -71 +24(T-48) <=0\n\n24(T-48) <=71\n\nT-48 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so T-48 <= 2\n\nU = -48 +24(T-48) >=0\n\n24(T-48) >=48\n\nT-48 >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSo T-48 >=2 and T-48 <=2, so T-48=2.\n\nThus unsafe only at T=50.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) span at T: [37 +4(T-48), 48 +4(T-48)]\n\n0 in span if 37 +4(T-48) <=0 and 48 +4(T-48) >=0\n\nBut 37 +4( ) is at least 37- something, min when T small, but 37>0, and as T increases, it gets larger, so L=37+4(T-48) >=37>0 for T>=48, so L>0 always, thus 0 never <= L, so 0 never in span for this car. Because head and tail both positive at t=48 and moving right, so span is always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4) span [1 +4(T-48), 12 +4(T-48)]\n\nL=1+4(T-48), U=12+4(T-48)\n\nAt T=48, L=1, U=12, both >0.\n\nAs T increases, larger, so L>=1>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) but direction right, so span [tail, head] = [-35, -24] at t=48.\n\nAt T: [-35 +4(T-48), -24 +4(T-48)]\n\n0 in span if L <=0 and U>=0.\n\nL = -35 +4(T-48) <=0\n\n4(T-48) <=35\n\nT-48 <= 35/4 = 8.75, so T-48 <=8\n\nU = -24 +4(T-48) >=0\n\n4(T-48) >=24\n\nT-48 >=6\n\nSo T-48 >=6 and T-48 <=8, so T-48=6,7,8.\n\nThus for T=54,55,56.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, unsafe when any car has 0 in span, but first two cars never, only third car when T=54,55,56.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at T=54,55,56.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so also unsafe at T=54,55,56.\n\nNow, freeway 1 to 6 are unsafe only at T=50.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: unsafe only T=50\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: unsafe only T=50\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe T=54,55,56\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe T=54,55,56\n\nFor other turns, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at turn 48 to y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=0 at turn 48.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path: I must pass through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some turns.\n\nSince I can move slowly, I need to avoid being on certain rows at bad times.\n\nFor example, if I go directly up, all U actions.\n\nStart turn 48, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{48}, y_{49} = 0 + Δy, if a_{48}=U, y_{49}=1\n\nThen at turn 49, I am at y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn general, at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nFor min time, I want to move up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\nFor row 1: unsafe only at T=50. So if I am on row 1 at turn 50, collision.\n\nSimilarly row 2,3,4,5,6 all unsafe only at T=50.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at T=54,55,56\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=54,55,56\n\nRows 1 to 6 are all unsafe only at T=50, and safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7 and 8 unsafe at 54,55,56, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, since rows 1-6 are only unsafe at one turn, and I need to be on each row for at least one turn, but I can choose when.\n\nFor min H, I should go up without delay, but skip the unsafe turn if possible.\n\nBut since the unsafe turn is the same for all rows 1-6, T=50.\n\nIf I am on any of rows 1-6 at turn 50, I collide.\n\nBut I can be on row 0 or row 7-9 at turn 50, but row 0 and 9 are safe, row 7 and 8 are safe at T=50 since unsafe only at 54-56.\n\nAt T=50, row 7 and 8 are safe.\n\nNow, let's see the timeline.\n\nTurn 48: I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI can choose to move up or stay.\n\nIf I move up at turn 48, a_{48}=U, then y_{49}=1.\n\nAt turn 49, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 is row 1, which is safe except at T=50.\n\nAt turn 49, T=49, not 50, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 49, I choose action.\n\nIf I go up again, a_{49}=U, then y_{50}=2.\n\nAt turn 50, I am at y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is row 2, and T=50, unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf at turn 49 I stay, a_{49}=S, then y_{50}=1, still on row 1 at turn 50, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, but y=1, if go down, y_{50}=0, which is safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nBut at turn 50, if I am on row 1,2,3,4,5, or 6, I collide.\n\nSo I must not be on rows 1-6 at turn 50.\n\nPossible to be on y=0,7,8,9 at turn 50.\n\ny=9 not reached yet.\n\nNow, at turn 48, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nTo avoid being on rows 1-6 at turn 50, I could delay moving up or something.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for a few turns.\n\nBut min time, I should move up as soon as possible except around bad times.\n\nTurn 50 is bad for rows 1-6.\n\nSo I need to be above or below rows 1-6 at turn 50.\n\ny=0 or y=7 or 8.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at turn 50.\n\nNow, from y=0 at turn 48, how to get to y=7 or 8 by turn 50.\n\nTurn 50 is two turns from now.\n\nAt turn 48: y=0\n\nAfter one action, turn 49: y could be 0 or 1.\n\nAfter second action, turn 50: y could be 0,1,2 or -1, but y>=0, so if at y=0 and S, y=0; U, y=1; D, y=0 since min 0.\n\ny cannot be negative, so if at y=0 and D, y stays 0.\n\nSimilarly, max 9.\n\nSo from y=0 at turn 48:\n\n- If a_{48}=S or D, y_{49}=0\n\n- If a_{48}=U, y_{49}=1\n\nThen at turn 49:\n\nIf y_{49}=0, then a_{49}:\n\n- S: y_{50}=0\n\n- U: y_{50}=1\n\n- D: y_{50}=0\n\nIf y_{49}=1, then a_{49}:\n\n- S: y_{50}=1\n\n- U: y_{50}=2\n\n- D: y_{50}=0\n\nNow, at turn 50, I need y_{50} not in {1,2,3,4,5,6}, so must be 0,7,8,9.\n\nBut from above, possible y_{50} values: 0,1,2.\n\nCannot be 7 or 8 in two moves from y=0.\n\nMax I can reach is y=2 if I go up both times.\n\nBut y=2 is bad at turn 50.\n\ny=0 or 1, but y=1 is bad if I am on it at turn 50.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nBut y=1 at turn 50 is unsafe.\n\nIn the options, at turn 50, I can be at y=0 or y=1 or y=2, all of which are either bad or not 7-8.\n\ny=0 is safe, but I need to go up later.\n\nI cannot reach y=7 or 8 by turn 50 from y=0 in two moves.\n\nTherefore, the only safe position at turn 50 is y=0.\n\nI must be at y=0 at turn 50.\n\nHow?\n\nAt turn 48, y=0.\n\nI need y_{50} = 0.\n\ny_{50} = y_{49} + Δy_{49}\n\ny_{49} = y_{48} + Δy_{48} = 0 + Δy_{48}\n\nSo y_{50} = Δy_{48} + Δy_{49}\n\nFor y_{50} = 0, since Δy in {-1,0,1}, possible only if both Δy_{48} and Δy_{49} are 0, or one +1 and one -1.\n\nBut y_{49} must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nIf both Δy=0, then y_{49} = 0 + 0 =0, y_{50} =0 +0=0.\n\nOr if Δy_{48}=U, y_{49}=1, then to have y_{50}=0, need Δy_{49}=D, so y_{50}=1-1=0.\n\nOr if Δy_{48}=D, y_{49}=0 (since min 0), then y_{50}=0 + something, but to be 0, need Δy_{49}=S or D.\n\nBut D at y=0 still y=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in all cases, to have y_{50}=0, I must have been at y=0 at turn 48 and not moved up, or moved up and down, but that wastes time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nOption 1: a_{48}=S or D, then y_{49}=0, then a_{49}=S or D, y_{50}=0.\n\nOption 2: a_{48}=U, y_{49}=1, then a_{49}=D, y_{50}=0.\n\nIn option 2, I go to y=1 and back, which takes two turns but no progress.\n\nFor min time, better to stay at y=0.\n\nBut I have to be at y=0 at turn 50 to avoid collision.\n\nThen after turn 50, I can start moving up.\n\nTurn 50 is over, and rows 1-6 are safe after that, since only unsafe at T=50.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7-8 have issues later.\n\nNow, at turn 50, y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\nMin turns from there: at least 9 moves up, so 9 actions, but with possible delays for rows 7-8.\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 54,55,56.\n\nI need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at turns 54,55,56.\n\nNow, let's see the turns.\n\nSet t = T - 48, so relative turn.\n\nTurn 48: t=0, y=0\n\nTurn 49: t=1\n\nTurn 50: t=2\n\n...\n\nWe need y at turn T.\n\nFor row 7 and 8, unsafe at t=6,7,8 (since T=54,55,56, t=T-48=6,7,8)\n\nt=0: turn 48\n\nt=1:49\n\nt=2:50\n\n...\n\nt=6: turn 54\n\nt=7:55\n\nt=8:56\n\nNow, at t=2, we must be at y=0.\n\nNow, from t=2, y=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so min 9 actions to increase by 9.\n\nBut we start from y at t=2.\n\nActions from turn 50 onwards.\n\nTurn 50 is t=2, we are at y=0 (position).\n\nAt turn 50, we choose action a_{50}, which determines y_{51}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nDefine the turn index.\n\nLet k be the number of actions after turn 48.\n\nBut since we have fixed actions for the first two turns to stay at 0.\n\nAt turn 48 and 49, we need to be at y=0 at turn 50.\n\nAs above, we can:\n\n- Stay at turn 48 and 49: a_{48}=S or D, a_{49}=S or D\n\n- Or move up and down: a_{48}=U, a_{49}=D\n\nFor min time, better to stay, so no move.\n\nSo let's assume we do a_{48}=S and a_{49}=S, so y_{49}=0, y_{50}=0.\n\nThen at turn 50 (t=2), y=0.\n\nNow, from here, we need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut we have to avoid rows 7 and 8 at t=6,7,8 (turns 54,55,56).\n\nt=6: turn 54, t=7:55, t=8:56.\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 unsafe at these turns.\n\nNow, we are at turn 50, t=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe time from t=2 to some t when y=9.\n\nLet T be the turn when we reach y=9.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\ny_{50} = 0\n\ny_{51} = y_{50} + Δy_{50} = Δy_{50}\n\n...\n\ny_{50 + k} = sum of first k actions from turn 50.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1.\n\nTo have y_{50+k} = 9, need sum of k Δy =9, each |Δy|<=1, so k >=9.\n\nMin k=9 if all U.\n\nBut may not be possible due to row 7 and 8 constraints.\n\nNow, we need to be on row 7 and 8 at some point, but not at t=6,7,8.\n\nt is relative to 48.\n\nTurn when we are on row.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at t=2, and go up.\n\nThe turn when we reach each y.\n\nFor row 7, we need to be on it not at t=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nt=6,7,8 correspond to absolute turns 54,55,56.\n\nNow, what are possible turns to be on row 7.\n\nSince we move step by step, the time to reach a row depends on when we start moving up.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nIf we go up every turn, we can be at:\n\nt=2: y=0\n\na_{50}=U, y_{51}=1 at t=3\n\nt=3: turn 51, y=1\n\na_{51}=U, y_{52}=2 at t=4\n\n...\n\nSo at turn t, y = t - 2\n\nBecause at t=2, y=0; t=3, y=1; ... t=11, y=9.\n\ny_{t} = y at turn t.\n\nt=2: y=0\n\nt=3: y=1\n\n...\n\nt=11: y=9\n\nNow, row 7: y=7, which at turn t=2 + 7 = 9? t when y=7.\n\ny=7 when? From above, if all U, y_t = t - 2\n\nSo y=7 when t-2=7, t=9.\n\nTurn t=9, absolute turn 48 +9 =57? t is offset, t=0 is turn48.\n\nTurn number: absolute turn T.\n\nT=48: t=0, y=0\n\nBut at T=48, we are at y=0.\n\nThen T=49: if a48=U, y=1, but we didn't, we stayed.\n\nIn our case, at T=50, t=2, y=0.\n\nThen if we go up every turn:\n\nT=50: y=0, choose a50=U, then T=51: y=1\n\nT=51: y=1, a51=U, T=52: y=2\n\nT=52: y=2, a52=U, T=53: y=3\n\nT=53: y=3, a53=U, T=54: y=4\n\nT=54: y=4, a54=U, T=55: y=5\n\nT=55: y=5, a55=U, T=56: y=6\n\nT=56: y=6, a56=U, T=57: y=7\n\nT=57: y=7, a57=U, T=58: y=8\n\nT=58: y=8, a58=U, T=59: y=9\n\nNow, we reach y=9 at T=59.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nFirst, at T=50: y=0, safe.\n\nT=51: y=1, row1, safe since only unsafe at T=50, not 51.\n\nSimilarly, T=52: y=2, safe\n\nT=53: y=3, safe\n\nT=54: y=4, row4, safe? Row 1-6 unsafe only at T=50, T=54 is later, so safe.\n\nT=55: y=5, safe\n\nT=56: y=6, safe\n\nT=57: y=7, row7. Now T=57, absolute turn 57, relative t=57-48=9.\n\nUnsafe for row7 at t=6,7,8 i.e., T=54,55,56.\n\nT=57 is t=9, which is after, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=58: y=8, row8, unsafe at T=54,55,56, not 58, safe.\n\nT=59: y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this path, no collisions, and we reach at T=59.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nH is the number of actions from t1=48.\n\nWe have actions from turn 48 to turn 58? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 48: we set a48=S, say, to stay at y=0 for turn 49.\n\nThen turn 49: a49=S, stay at y=0 for turn 50.\n\nThen turn 50: a50=U\n\n...\n\nup to turn 58: a58=U to go to y=9 at turn 59.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from turn 48 to turn 58, that's 11 actions? Turns: 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58.\n\nThat's 11 turns of actions.\n\nActions: a48 to a58, 11 actions, and y59=9.\n\nSince y48=0, after 11 actions, y59=9.\n\nMin possible is 9 actions if we go directly, but we had to wait two turns, so 11 is more.\n\nBut in this case, we reached without collision.\n\nBut can we do with fewer actions?\n\nFor example, if we didn't have to stay at turn 50.\n\nBut we must avoid rows 1-6 at turn 50.\n\nWe could be on row 7 or 8 at turn 50, but we can't reach from y=0 in two moves.\n\nUnless we start moving earlier.\n\nAt turn 48, y=0.\n\nIf we move up immediately.\n\na48=U, then at turn 49, y=1.\n\nNow at turn 49, y=1, which is safe since T=49 not 50.\n\nNow, at turn 49, we need to choose action so that at turn 50, we are not on rows 1-6.\n\nPossible: if we go to y=0 or y=7 or y=8.\n\ny=7 or 8 not possible in one move from y=1.\n\nSo only to y=0: a49=D.\n\nThen at turn 50, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, from turn 50, y=0, start going up.\n\nBut we used two actions: a48=U and a49=D, to go from y=0 to y=1 and back to y=0, no progress, same as staying.\n\nThen from turn 50, go up to y=9 in 9 actions, reach at turn 59.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, to save time, we need to be at a higher y earlier, so that we can be on row 7 or 8 before the unsafe times or after.\n\nFor rows 7 and 8, unsafe at T=54,55,56.\n\nWe can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 7 before T=54 or after T=56.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nIn the direct path with waiting, we were on row 7 at T=57, which is after 56, safe.\n\nBut we wasted two turns at start.\n\nCan we avoid that?\n\nPerhaps by moving slower in the middle or something.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only unsafe at one turn, and we can pass them quickly, but the problem is at that exact turn we must not be on them.\n\nBut since we have to go through all, and the unsafe turn is the same, we must skip that turn entirely.\n\nHence, we need to be below or above at that turn.\n\nBelow: y=0.\n\nAbove: y=7 or 8.\n\nBut from start, in two moves, we can only reach y=2 max, not 7.\n\nSo impossible to be above at T=50.\n\nThus must be at y=0 at T=50.\n\nNo choice but to wait or oscillate, wasting at least one turn? In terms of progress.\n\nFrom turn 48 to 50, we stay at y=0, so in two turns, no progress.\n\nThen from turn 50 to turn 59, 9 turns to go up 9 steps.\n\nTotal 11 actions to reach turn 59.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, so 11 actions.\n\nThe sequence: actions from turn 48 to turn 58, 11 actions, y59=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach faster with rows 7-8.\n\nFor example, if we go up faster initially, but we can't because of turn 50.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 only for one turn, but at turn 50 we must be at y=0.\n\nAt turn 48, if we stay, y49=0.\n\nThen at turn 49, if we stay, y50=0.\n\nIf we move up at turn 49, y50=1, which is bad.\n\nSo we must not move up at turn 49 if we are at y=0, or must move down, but same.\n\nNo way.\n\nPerhaps we can reach row 7 early and stay there until after unsafe times, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, to reach row 7 early.\n\nFrom turn 48, y=0.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nT=48: y=0, a48=U, T=49: y=1\n\nT=49: y=1, a49=U, T=50: y=2 → but y=2 at T=50, collision! Not possible.\n\nIf we go up but slower.\n\na48=U, T=49: y=1\n\nThen at T=49, instead of U, we do S or D.\n\nIf S, y50=1, still on row1 at T=50, collision.\n\nIf D, y50=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo must waste two turns at start.\n\nNow, for rows 7 and 8, in the path above, we passed them after the unsafe times, at T=57 and 58, which are safe.\n\nBut we can pass them before the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 7 before T=54.\n\nT=54 is turn 54.\n\nFrom turn 50, y=0.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible, we reach y=7 at turn 57, as above, which is after T=56.\n\nTo reach earlier: from T=50 y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, y at T=50+k.\n\ny_{50+k} = k, if all U.\n\nSet T=50+k.\n\ny at T is y_T.\n\nAt T=50, y=0.\n\nAfter action at T=50, y51 = y50 + Δy50.\n\nIf all U, y51=1, y52=2, ..., y57=7 at T=57.\n\ny57=7.\n\nT=57 > 56, safe.\n\nTo reach y=7 at earlier turn.\n\nFor example, at T=54, y=7.\n\nBut from T=50 y=0 to T=54 y=7, that would require increasing y by 7 in 4 turns, but each turn max +1, so min 7 turns, from T=50 to T=57, as above.\n\nImpossible to reach y=7 before T=57 if start from y=0 at T=50.\n\nT=50: y=0\n\nT=51: y=1\n\nT=52: y=2\n\nT=53: y=3\n\nT=54: y=4\n\nT=55: y=5\n\nT=56: y=6\n\nT=57: y=7\n\nSo at T=54, y=4; T=55, y=5; T=56, y=6; all below 7.\n\nCannot be on row 7 before T=57.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at T=58.\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 are unsafe at T=54,55,56.\n\nAt T=54,55,56, y is 4,5,6 respectively if going up, which are rows 4,5,6, which are safe at those times, since only unsafe at T=50.\n\nThen at T=57, y=7, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus the path with waiting and then going up works.\n\nBut we used two turns to stay at y=0.\n\nTotal actions: from turn 48 to turn 58, 11 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can start moving earlier for the upper rows.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7 and 8 are unsafe only at specific times, and we pass them late, but we could delay or advance passing them.\n\nBut in this case, since we have to go through all, and min time is fixed, but with the initial delay.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to row 6 quickly and stay there or something, but row 6 at T=50 is unsafe, but T=50 is past.\n\nAfter T=50, row 6 is safe.\n\nIn the path, at T=56, y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut to save time, since we wasted two turns at start, we need 11 turns total.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns.\n\nStart turn 48: position y=0\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn 48+H, position y=9.\n\ny_{48+H} =9.\n\ny_{48} =0, so after H actions, y_{48+H} = sum of Δy from t=48 to 48+H-1, must be 9.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so H >=9.\n\nIn our case, with two actions having Δy=0 (staying), we have H=11, with two Δy=0 and nine Δy=1.\n\nIf we can have Δy=1 for all except necessary, but here we need the two stays to avoid collision.\n\nBut in the move up and down case, we have Δy=1 and then Δy=-1, so net zero, same as two stays.\n\nNo better.\n\nNow, for the rows 7 and 8, since we pass after unsafe times, it's fine.\n\nBut is there a way to pass row 7 and 8 before the unsafe times?\n\nFor example, if we could be on row 7 at T=53 or earlier.\n\nBut from start, with the delay, at T=50 y=0, earliest y=7 at T=57.\n\nIf we didn't have the initial delay, but we must have it.\n\nSuppose at turn 48, we go up to y=1.\n\nThen at turn 49, we go down to y=0, to be safe at turn 50.\n\nBut turn 49: we are at y=1, which is safe since T=49.\n\nThen turn 50 at y=0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nThen from turn 50, go up.\n\nNo difference.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to higher rows before turn 50, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 50, if we could be on y=7, but can't.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce with rows 7-8.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up slowly at first, but that might make us hit the unsafe times later.\n\nBut in this case, since rows 7-8 unsafe late, and we pass late, it's ok.\n\nSuppose we want to pass row 7 before T=54.\n\nFor example, at T=53.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=53.\n\nNow, at T=50, we must be at y=0, as established.\n\nThen from T=50 y=0 to T=53 y=7: in 3 turns, increase y by 7, impossible, max increase 3, to y=3.\n\nCannot.\n\nSimilarly, at T=54 y=7, from T=50 y=0, 4 turns, max y=4.\n\nCannot reach y=7 before T=57.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at T=58.\n\nNow, the unsafe times for row 7 are T=54,55,56.\n\nAt these times, if we are on row 7, collision.\n\nBut in the path, we are on row 7 at T=57, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we could be on row 7 at T=53 or earlier, but impossible from y=0 at T=50.\n\nIf we are on row 7 at T=53, but y at T=53 must be <=3, as above.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, sequence of actions.\n\nFrom turn 48: we need to be at y=0 at turn 50.\n\nSo for turn 48: action a_{48}, should be S or D to keep y=0 for turn 49.\n\nSimilarly, turn 49: action a_{49}, S or D to keep y=0 for turn 50.\n\nThen turn 50 to 58: all U to go up to y=9 at turn 59.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 48: S (stay)\n\nTurn 49: S (stay)\n\nThen Turn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nAfter turn 58 U, y_{59} = y_{58} +1, but y_{58} is after action at turn 58.\n\nAt turn 58, y=8 (since after turn 57 U, y58=8), then a58=U, y59=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in terms of the sequence, actions from turn 48 to turn 58.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed from turn t1=48.\n\nAlso, we need to make sure no collision during the path.\n\nAs we checked earlier: at turn 50: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 51: y=1, row1, safe (only unsafe at 50)\n\nTurn 52: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 53: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 54: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 55: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 56: y=6, safe\n\nTurn 57: y=7, row7, T=57, not 54-56, safe\n\nTurn 58: y=8, row8, safe\n\nTurn 59: y=9, done.\n\nAnd during the actions, no issue.\n\nBut at turn 54,55,56, we are on y=4,5,6, which are rows 4,5,6, and at those turns, safe.\n\nNow, about the cars: for example, on row 7, cars at T=54,55,56 unsafe, but we are on row 7 at T=57, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10 actions.\n\nThen y_{48+10} = y_{58} =9.\n\ny_{48} =0, so sum of 10 Δy =9, so nine +1 and one 0, or eight +1 and two 0, etc., but min with one stay.\n\nBut we need to avoid row 1-6 at turn 50.\n\nTurn 50 is turn index 2.\n\nAt turn 50, we must not be on row 1-6.\n\nWith H=10 actions, the actions from turn 48 to 57.\n\ny at turn 50 depends on first two actions.\n\ny_{50} = y_{48} + Δy_{48} + something, wait.\n\ny_{50} = y_{49} + Δy_{49}, but y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy_{48}\n\nSince y_{48}=0, y_{49} = Δy_{48}, y_{50} = Δy_{48} + Δy_{49}\n\nFor y_{50} not in 1-6, must be 0,7,8,9.\n\nBut Δy_{48} and Δy_{49} in {-1,0,1}, so y_{50} = Δy_{48} + Δy_{49} can only be -2,-1,0,1,2, since min each -1, max each 1.\n\ny_{50} must be between 0 and 9, so possible -2,-1,0,1,2, but y>=0, so -2,-1 impossible, so y_{50} can be 0,1,2.\n\nCannot be 7,8,9.\n\nSo must be 0 to avoid collision.\n\nThus y_{50}=0, which requires that Δy_{48} and Δy_{49} such that y_{50}=0.\n\nEither both 0, or one +1 and one -1.\n\nIn both cases, after two actions, y=0, no progress.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 from y=0 at turn 50 in 8 actions? Actions from turn 50 to turn 57? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions total, from turn 48 to 48+H-1.\n\ny_{48+H} =9.\n\ny_{50} =0.\n\nSo the actions from turn 50 to turn 48+H-1 must increase y from 0 to 9.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 50 to turn 48+H-1 is (48+H-1) - 50 +1 = H - 2 +1 -50? Indices.\n\nActions: a_{50}, a_{51}, ..., up to a_{48+H-1}\n\nFirst action after turn 50 is a_{50}, which affects y_{51}.\n\nLast action a_{48+H-1} affects y_{48+H}.\n\ny_{50} =0\n\ny_{48+H} =9\n\nSo the change from y_{50} to y_{48+H} is due to actions from a_{50} to a_{48+H-1}, which is (48+H-1) - 50 +1 = H - 2 actions? Number of actions: from index 50 to index (48+H-1), inclusive.\n\nNumber: (48+H-1) - 50 +1 = 48 + H -1 -50 +1 = H - 2.\n\nFor example, if H=10, actions from 50 to 48+9=57? 48+H-1=48+10-1=57.\n\nActions: a_{50} to a_{57}, that's 8 actions (50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57).\n\ny_{58} = y_{50} + sum of Δy from a_{50} to a_{57}\n\ny_{58} =9, y_{50}=0, so sum of 8 Δy must be 9.\n\nBut each |Δy|<=1, max sum 8, cannot reach 9. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, for H=10, impossible to reach y=9 from y=0 at turn 50 with only 8 actions? Actions from a_{50} to a_{57} affect y_{51} to y_{58}.\n\ny_{50} to y_{58} is 8 steps, but 8 actions determine y_{51} to y_{58}, so change from y_{50} to y_{58} is 8 increments, each at most 1, so y_{58} <= y_{50} +8 =0+8=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\ny_{58} <=8 if y_{50}=0.\n\nTo reach y=9, need at least turn 59 or later.\n\ny_{58} <=8, y_{59} <=9.\n\nWith y_{50}=0, to have y_{59}=9, need 9 actions from a_{50} to a_{58}, which affect y_{51} to y_{59}.\n\ny_{50} to y_{59} is 9 increments, so y_{59} <= y_{50} +9 =9.\n\nCan be 9 if all +1.\n\nSimilarly, with H total actions.\n\ny_{48+H} =9.\n\ny_{50} =0.\n\nThe number of increments from turn 50 to turn 48+H is (48+H) - 50 = H - 2.\n\ny_{48+H} = y_{50} + sum_{t=50}^{48+H-1} Δy_t\n\nNumber of terms: from t=50 to t=48+H-1 inclusive, that is (48+H-1) - 50 +1 = H - 2 actions.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_{48+H} <= y_{50} + (H-2) = 0 + H - 2.\n\nSet equal to 9, so H - 2 >=9, H>=11.\n\nEquality when all Δy=1 for the H-2 actions, and y_{50}=0.\n\nWhich is what we have.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nAnd we have a sequence.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose to stay or move down, but for min time, stay is fine.\n\nAlso, in the action, we can use S or D at y=0, both keep y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 48 and 49, we use S.\n\nThen U all the way.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nNow, about the cars on row 7 and 8: we have three cars, but we only care when 0 is covered.\n\nIn our path, we are not on row 7 at unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, we have cars, but at T=57 and 58, are they safe?\n\nFor example, row 7 at T=57.\n\nt=57-48=9.\n\nCar on row 7: the third car, with span at T: [-35 +4(T-48), -24 +4(T-48)]\n\nAt T=57, t=9, L= -35 +4*9= -35+36=1, U= -24+36=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly at T=58 for row 8, same.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: S\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nAfter Turn 58 U, y_{59}=9.\n\nActions from turn 48 to 58.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be listed.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t1=48.\n\nNow, H=11, from t=48 to t=58.\n\nBut the turn when we reach y=9 is turn 59, after last action.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can write it as:\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: S\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nNow, to box it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are three cars, but only the third one could be issue, but we avoided.\n\nAlso, for the initial rows, we avoided turn 50.\n\nSo I think this is minimal and correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring \\(H = 11\\) actions.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Collision Avoidance at Turn 50:** Freeways 1 to 6 are unsafe at turn 50 (relative turn \\(t = 2\\)) because cars on these rows cover \\(x = 0\\) at that turn. To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) or \\(y \\geq 7\\) (impossible to reach from \\(y = 0\\) in two moves) at turn 50. Thus, the player must remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 49 and 50 by staying (S) on turns 48 and 49.\n- **Collision Avoidance for Freeways 7 and 8:** Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 54, 55, and 56 (relative turns \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\)) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). Starting from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 50, the player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 57 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 58, both after the unsafe period (turns 54–56), ensuring safety.\n- **Minimal Turns:** After avoiding the turn 50 collision, the player moves up (U) every turn from turn 50 to 58, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 59. The initial two stays (turns 48 and 49) are necessary, resulting in \\(H = 11\\) actions (turns 48 to 58). Any fewer actions would either violate the collision constraint at turn 50 or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 59.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=48}^{58}\\) is as follows, ensuring \\(y_{59} = 9\\) with no collisions:\n- At turn 48, staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 49 (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway).\n- At turn 49, staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 50 (safe, avoiding rows 1–6 at the unsafe turn).\n- From turns 50 to 58, moving up (U) each turn increases \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 59. During this ascent:\n  - Turns 51–56: Player is on rows 1–6, which are safe except at turn 50 (already avoided).\n  - Turn 57: Player is on row 7 at turn 57, safe as row 7 is unsafe only at turns 54–56.\n  - Turn 58: Player is on row 8 at turn 58, safe as row 8 is unsafe only at turns 54–56.\n\n### Verification of Car Collisions:\n- **Freeways 1–6:** Unsafe only at turn 50; player avoids these rows at that turn.\n- **Freeway 7:** Cars are safe at turn 57 (e.g., third car span \\([1, 12]\\) at \\(T = 57\\), \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\)).\n- **Freeway 8:** Similarly safe at turn 58.\n- All other positions and turns are collision-free as per car spans and update rules.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 11\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 50. I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, the x=0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe car spans move based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase. But looking at the car states, all cars seem to be right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all. Let me confirm:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) — head -48, tail -83? That seems backward. Typically, for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here head is -48 and tail is -83, which is less than -48? -83 is smaller, so if it's right-moving, the head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head should be larger. But -48 > -83, so head -48 is greater than tail -83, so yes, it's consistent. Span [τ, h] with τ=-83, h=-48, so from -83 to -48, and moving right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4). For each, head and tail: for (48,37), head=48, tail=37? 48>37, so span [37,48] moving right. Similarly, (12,1) [1,12], (-24,-35) [-35,-24]? -24 > -35, so span [-35,-24] moving right.\n\nNow, the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions U: +1, D: -1, S: 0. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, we need to move up. But we have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, when the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, x=0 is in the span of a car at turn T.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nIn other words, at turn T, you are only on freeway y_T. When you take an action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might be collided if on that freeway, a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThen you choose action, which determines y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=50, position (0,0). So at turn 50, we are on y=0, which has no cars, since cars are only on y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars. The freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo at turn 50, we are on y=0, no collision possible.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so y=9, which should also be safe.\n\nBut to get there, we have to pass through y=1 to 8, and avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nNow, since we start at turn 50, and we need to find actions for turns starting from t_1=50.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=50 for simplicity, but it's t_1.\n\nSet t=0 as turn 50 for ease, so t=0: position y=0.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H such that after H turns, we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at t=0, position y=0.\n\nAfter one action at t=0, we go to y_1, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=H, we are at y_H.\n\nWe start at turn t=0, position y_0=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn t=1, position y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1} at turn H-1, position at turn H is y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H, minimal H.\n\nSince we need to reach (0,9), and x is always 0, so only y matters.\n\nNow, the cars: we need to know for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nBut turns are global, starting from t=50.\n\nSo for turn T, which is t_1 + t for some t.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so at time step τ, relative to start.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t_1=50, y=0.\n\nAfter action, at τ=1, turn 51, y_1, and so on.\n\nFor car positions, at turn T, which is t_1 + τ.\n\nt_1 = 50.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial at turn t_1: head h, tail τ (let's use t for tail to avoid confusion), direction d, speed s.\n\nIn the span, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, span at turn t_1 is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nThen at turn T = t_1 + Δt, position: since moving right, each car's position increases by s * Δt.\n\nThe span becomes [tail + s * Δt, head + s * Δt] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would decrease, but all are right-moving here.\n\nNow, collision at turn T for freeway k if the player is on y_T = k and 0 is in the span of some car on k at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span, where min and max depend on direction.\n\nSince all right-moving, for a car, span at T is [τ + s * (T - t_1), h + s * (T - t_1)] where τ and h are tail and head at t_1.\n\nAnd 0 is covered if τ + s * (T - t_1) <= 0 <= h + s * (T - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left here.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have the cars.\n\nList the freeways and their cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tail = -83, head = -48, s=36, right\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1? (-48,-83,right,36) — tail -83, head -48, s=36\n\nFreeway 3: same: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nAll have the same car? No, freeway 1,2,3 each have one car with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48,-71,right,24) tail -71, head -48? Head -48, tail -71, so since right, tail < head, -71 < -48, so span [-71, -48] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, I think.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nThen freeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFor (48,37): head=48, tail=37, so span [37,48] at t_1, s=4\n\n(12,1): head=12, tail=1, span [1,12]\n\n(-24,-35): head=-24, tail=-35, span [-35,-24]\n\nAll s=4.\n\nFreeway 8: same cars as 7.\n\nNow, t_1=50.\n\nWe need to find when x=0 is covered for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, we need to know for each possible turn T and each freeway k, whether 0 is covered on k at T.\n\nBut T starts from 50.\n\nLet Δt = T - 50, so at time τ = Δt, turn T=50+τ.\n\nFor a car, span at τ: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] for right-moving, with τ and h at τ=0.\n\nSet τ relative, so at τ=0, span [t, h] where t is tail, h head.\n\nThen at time τ (elapsed), span [t + s*τ, h + s*τ]\n\n0 covered if t + s*τ <= 0 <= h + s*τ\n\nWhich means t + s*τ <= 0 and 0 <= h + s*τ, so -h/s <= τ <= -t/s ? Let's see.\n\nt + s*τ <= 0 => s*τ <= -t => τ <= -t/s\n\n0 <= h + s*τ => s*τ >= -h => τ >= -h/s\n\nSince s >0.\n\nSo τ >= -h/s and τ <= -t/s\n\nBut h and t could be negative, so -h/s and -t/s.\n\nSince t < h, -h/s < -t/s because h > t implies -h < -t, so -h/s < -t/s.\n\nSo the interval is [ -h/s, -t/s ]\n\nτ must satisfy ceil( -h/s ) <= τ <= floor( -t/s )? Since τ integer, but we need to check the inequality.\n\nThe car covers 0 when τ >= -h/s and τ <= -t/s.\n\nSince τ integer, we can find the range.\n\nFor each car, compute the τ values where it covers 0.\n\nThen for a freeway, if any car covers 0 at that τ, then the freeway is blocked at that turn.\n\nNow, for freeways with multiple cars, we need to see if any car covers 0.\n\nFirst, let's handle freeways 1,2,3: each has one car: t = -83, h = -48, s=36\n\nSo τ >= -h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nτ <= -t/s = -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nτ integer, so τ >= ceil(1.333) = 2? τ >= 1.333, so since τ integer, τ >= 2\n\nτ <= 2.305, so τ <= 2\n\nThus τ = 2\n\nOnly at τ=2, this car covers 0.\n\nτ >= 1.333 and τ <= 2.305, so τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 1,2,3, each has this car, so at τ=2 (turn 52), freeway 1,2,3 are blocked because 0 is covered.\n\nNow freeway 4,5,6: each car t=-71, h=-48, s=24\n\nτ >= -h/s = -(-48)/24 = 48/24 = 2\n\nτ <= -t/s = -(-71)/24 = 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSo τ >= 2 and τ <= 2.958, so τ=2 and τ=3? τ <= 2.958, so τ=2 or 3? Let's see:\n\nτ >= 2, τ <= 71/24 = 2 + 23/24 ≈ 2.958, so τ=2 and τ=3? τ=2: 2 <= 2.958, yes; τ=3: 3 <= 2.958? 3 > 2.958, no, so only τ=2.\n\nτ <= floor(71/24) = floor(2.958) = 2, and τ >= ceil(48/24) = ceil(2) =2.\n\nSo only τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4,5,6, blocked only at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) so t=37, h=48, s=4\n\nτ >= -h/s = -48/4 = -12\n\nτ <= -t/s = -37/4 = -9.25\n\nτ >= -12 and τ <= -9.25\n\nSince τ >=0 (time from now), and -12 to -9.25, all negative, so no τ >=0 satisfies, so this car never covers 0 in future. Good.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) t=1, h=12, s=4\n\nτ >= -h/s = -12/4 = -3\n\nτ <= -t/s = -1/4 = -0.25\n\nτ >= -3 and τ <= -0.25, again negative, so no coverage for τ>=0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) t=-35, h=-24, s=4\n\nτ >= -h/s = -(-24)/4 = 24/4 = 6\n\nτ <= -t/s = -(-35)/4 = 35/4 = 8.75\n\nSo τ >=6 and τ <=8.75, so τ=6,7,8\n\nThus for freeway 7, this car covers 0 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so same: blocked at τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, freeway 1 to 6 blocked only at τ=2, and freeway 7 and 8 blocked at τ=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: blocked at τ=2\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: blocked at τ=2\n\nFreeway 7: blocked at τ=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: blocked at τ=6,7,8\n\nAt other times, these freeways are clear.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we need to move from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, we should move up as much as possible, but we have to avoid being on a blocked freeway at the wrong time.\n\nSpecifically, at each turn τ, when we are on y_τ, it must not be blocked.\n\ny_τ is the position at turn τ.\n\nAt turn τ, we are on freeway y_τ, and we must not have collision, meaning that for freeway y_τ, at turn τ, it should not be blocked.\n\nIf y_τ is between 1 and 8, it must not be blocked at τ.\n\nIf y_τ=0 or 9, no problem.\n\nNow, actions: we choose a_t for t from τ=0 to τ=H-1, to reach y_H=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to be at y=9, the minimal H without obstacles would be 9, by going up every turn.\n\nBut with obstacles, we might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut in this case, the obstacles are only at specific times.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=2, freeways 1 to 6 are all blocked. Freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6 are blocked at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=6,7,8, freeways 7 and 8 are blocked.\n\nAt other τ, all freeways are clear.\n\nNow, we need to plan the path to avoid being on a blocked freeway when it is blocked.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, if we are on y=1,2,3,4,5, or 6, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6,7,8, if we are on y=7 or 8, we collide.\n\nAt other times, we can be on any freeway safely.\n\nAlso, since we can move up, down, or stay, we can control when we are on which y.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the bad times.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAt τ=0, we choose action, which determines y at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, y=0, and after H actions, we are at τ=H, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H=9.\n\nThe y position changes by at most 1 per turn, so from 0 to 9, min H=9, but might not be possible due to blocks.\n\nFirst, the critical points: at τ=2, we must not be on y=1 to 6.\n\nThat means at turn τ=2, we should be either on y=0,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut y=0 and 9 are safe, and y=7 and 8 are safe at τ=2 because only blocked at τ=6,7,8 for y=7,8? Freeway 7 and 8 blocked at τ=6,7,8, so at τ=2, they are safe.\n\nAt τ=2, freeway 7 and 8 are not blocked, only blocked at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1-6 blocked only at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=2, to avoid collision, we must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6. We can be on y=0,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, we might not be there yet.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6,7,8, we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo at those times, we should be on y=0-6 or 9.\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nLet's think about the sequence.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up, but we need to time to avoid the blocks.\n\nFirst, at τ=2, we need to be away from y=1-6.\n\nSo possible positions at τ=2: y=0,7,8,9.\n\nBut at τ=0, y=0, after two actions, at τ=2, we can be at y=0,1,2 depending on actions.\n\nIf we go up twice, y=2 at τ=2, but y=2 is blocked at τ=2, so we collide.\n\nIf we stay or go down, we might be at y=0 or 1, but y=1 is also blocked, so only if we are at y=0 at τ=2, we are safe.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0 is safe.\n\ny=7 or 8 or 9, but from τ=0, in two moves, we can reach at most y=2, since each move up increases by 1.\n\nStart τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter a0: to y1, at τ=1\n\nAfter a1: to y2, at τ=2\n\ny2 can be from 0 to 2, depending on actions.\n\nIf we go up both times, y2=2\n\nIf up then stay, y2=1? At τ=1, after a0, position y1.\n\nAt turn τ=1, position y1.\n\nThen after a1, at turn τ=2, position y2.\n\ny2 = y1 + Δy from a1.\n\nBut y1 = y0 + Δy from a0 = 0 + Δy.\n\nSo possible:\n\n- If a0=S, a1=S: y2=0\n\n- a0=S, a1=U: y2=1\n\n- a0=S, a1=D: y2=-1? But y cannot be negative, y must be in [0,9], so if y=0 and D, it should stay? Or invalid?\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\n\nSo if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy=-1, but y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so probably it stays or clips, but the rule says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so I think it must be that y_{t+1} is clipped to the boundary.\n\nThe text says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if it goes below 0, it becomes 0, above 9 becomes 9? It doesn't specify, but since it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], it must be constrained.\n\nSimilarly for up to 9.\n\nSo we can assume that if action would take it out of bounds, it stays or clips, but to be safe, let's assume that y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy))\n\nBut in this case, since we start at 0, and go to 9, and bounds, but we might not go down much.\n\nBut at y=0, D action: y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U action, y=9.\n\nNow, back to τ=2 position.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter a0, at τ=1, y1 = {0 if a0=S or D, 1 if a0=U}\n\nThen at τ=2, y2:\n\nIf y1=0, then y2=0 if a1=S or D, or 1 if a1=U\n\nIf y1=1, then y2=0 if a1=D, 1 if a1=S, 2 if a1=U\n\nBut y1=1 only if a0=U.\n\nAt τ=2, we must not be on y=1-6, so we must be at y=0,7,8,9.\n\nBut from above, possible y2 values: 0 or 1 or 2.\n\ny2 cannot be 7,8,9 in two moves from 0.\n\nSo only possible safe position at τ=2 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nTo achieve that, we need to not move up at all in the first two turns.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Option: a0=S, a1=S: then at τ=1 y=0, τ=2 y=0\n\n- a0=S, a1=D: but at y=0, D keeps y=0, so same as S.\n\n- a0=D, a1=S: y1=0 (since at 0, D to 0), y2=0\n\n- a0=D, a1=D: y1=0, y2=0\n\n- a0=U: then y1=1, then to have y2=0, we need a1=D, so y2=0\n\nBut if a0=U, y1=1, which is freeway 1, and at τ=1, is it blocked?\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 1: is it blocked?\n\nEarlier, for freeway 1, blocked only at τ=2, not at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, for freeway 1, car: t=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nAt τ=1, span [ -83 +36*1, -48 +36*1] = [-47, -12]\n\n0 not in [-47,-12], so not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at τ=1.\n\nFreeway 1-6 blocked only at τ=2, so at τ=1, all clear.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8, at τ=1, no issue.\n\nSo at τ=1, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen if we do a0=U, to y=1 at τ=1, then a1=D, to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nBut going up then down wastes moves, and we are back to start, so not efficient.\n\nTo be at y=0 at τ=2, the most efficient is to stay or down, but since down at y=0 does nothing, we can just do S or D for first two actions to stay at y=0.\n\nBut S or D both keep y=0, so we can do S,S for example.\n\nNow, after τ=2, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut there is another block at τ=6,7,8 for y=7 and 8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, from τ=2, we are at y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps from y=0 to y=9 is 9 up moves, but we might need to delay to avoid the bad times.\n\nAt τ=6,7,8, we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo at those turns, we should be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, let's think about when we can be on y=7 and 8.\n\nSince freeways 7 and 8 are only blocked at τ=6,7,8, we can be on them at other times.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should start moving up after τ=2.\n\nBut we have to consider the position at critical times.\n\nFirst, at τ=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe critical times are τ=6,7,8 for y=7,8.\n\nWe need to ensure that at τ=6,7,8, we are not on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo we can be on lower y or on y=9.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at τ=2, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe time from τ=2 to some point.\n\nLet t' = τ - 2, so after the first critical point.\n\nAt t'=0 (τ=2), y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t'.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so min t' to reach y=9 is 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t'=4,5,6 because τ=6,7,8 corresponds to t'=4,5,6 since τ= t' + 2.\n\nτ = t' + 2, so when τ=6, t'=4; τ=7, t'=5; τ=8, t'=6.\n\nAt t'=4,5,6 (τ=6,7,8), we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, at t'=0, y=0.\n\nIf we go up every turn, at t'=k, y=k.\n\nSo at t'=4, y=4; t'=5, y=5; t'=6, y=6. All y<=6, which is safe, since y=7 and 8 are the only ones blocked, but we are on y=4,5,6 at those times, which are freeways 4,5,6, but at τ=6,7,8, freeway 4,5,6 are not blocked, only blocked at τ=2, which is past.\n\nAt τ=6,7,8, freeway 1-6 are clear, only 7 and 8 blocked.\n\nSo at t'=4,5,6, if y=4,5,6, we are on freeway 4,5,6, which are safe at that time.\n\nThen we can continue to go up.\n\nAt t'=7, y=7; but t'=7 corresponds to τ=9.\n\nτ= t' + 2, t'=7, τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, is there any block? Freeway 7 and 8 blocked only at τ=6,7,8, so at τ=9, they are clear.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways clear except the times we mentioned.\n\nSo at t'=7, y=7, freeway 7, at τ=9, clear.\n\nThen t'=8, y=8, freeway 8 at τ=10, clear.\n\nt'=9, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn terms of t', from t'=0 to t'=9, we go up each time.\n\ny at t'=0: 0\n\nt'=1: y=1\n\n...\n\nt'=9: y=9\n\nNow, at critical times t'=4,5,6 (τ=6,7,8), y=4,5,6, which are not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nAnd at other times, all safe.\n\nNow, τ relative to start: τ=2 + t'\n\nAt τ=2, t'=0, y=0\n\nAfter actions from τ=2 onwards.\n\nIn terms of global turn.\n\nWe have actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, position at τ=H.\n\nIn this plan, we have the first two actions to stay at y=0 for τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nThen from τ=2, we start moving up.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nSet τ from 0:\n\n- At τ=0: position y=0, we take action a_{t1} = a_{50}\n\n- At τ=1: position y=1? No.\n\nAt τ=0, after action, we go to position at τ=1.\n\nTo be at y=0 at τ=2, we need to not move up in first two actions.\n\nFor example, at τ=0: take action S or D, so that at τ=1, y=0\n\nThen at τ=1: take action S or D, so that at τ=2, y=0\n\nThen from τ=2: we can start going up.\n\nNow, at τ=2, position y=0\n\nWe take action to go to y=1 at τ=3? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at τ=2, position at τ=3.\n\nDefine:\n\n- Turn τ: position y_τ, take action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1}\n\nSo:\n\nAt τ=0: y_0 = 0, take a_0\n\nThen y_1 = y_0 + Δy from a_0\n\nAt τ=1: position y_1, take a_1, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy from a_1\n\n...\n\nAt τ=H-1: take a_{H-1}, then y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy from a_{H-1}\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nIn our case, we set that at τ=2, y_2 = 0.\n\nTo have y_2 = 0:\n\nSince y_0 = 0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\ny_2 = 0.\n\nPossible if:\n\n- Δy_0 = 0 and Δy_1 = 0: then y_1=0, y_2=0\n\n- Or Δy_0 = +1 (U), then y_1=1, then Δy_1 = -1 (D), y_2=0\n\nBut the second option wastes a move, since we go up and down, net zero progress.\n\nTo minimize H, we should avoid unnecessary moves, so better to take S or D for first two actions to stay at 0.\n\nFor example, take a_0 = S, then y_1 = 0\n\nThen a_1 = S, then y_2 = 0\n\nNow, at τ=2, y_2=0, we can start moving up.\n\nNow, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=2, to y=9.\n\nIf we go up every turn, we can reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\ny at τ=2: 0\n\nAfter a_2: to y_3, if U, y_3=1\n\na_3: U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nContinue up.\n\nAfter k up moves, y = k at τ = 2 + k\n\nSet: after action at τ=2, position at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=2, take action, to position at τ=3.\n\nSo if at τ=2, take U, then y_3 =1\n\nThen at τ=3, take U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nAt τ=2 + i, take U, then y_{3+i} = i+1? Let's index.\n\nAt time τ, after action, position at τ+1.\n\nSo:\n\n- At τ=2: take U, then y_3 = 1\n\n- τ=3: take U, y_4=2\n\n- τ=4: take U, y_5=3\n\n- τ=5: take U, y_6=4\n\n- τ=6: take U, y_7=5\n\n- τ=7: take U, y_8=6\n\n- τ=8: take U, y_9=7\n\n- τ=9: take U, y_10=8\n\n- τ=10: take U, y_11=9\n\nNow, at y_11=9, so we reach at τ=11.\n\nNow, check the positions at critical times.\n\nFirst, at τ=2, y_2=0, safe.\n\nNow, at τ=6,7,8: we need to see where we are.\n\nAt τ=6: position y_6\n\nFrom above, y_6=4 (since at τ=5, after action U, y_6=4? Let's list positions:\n\nτ: position at that turn.\n\nAt τ=2: y=0\n\nτ=3: y=1 (after a_2=U)\n\nτ=4: y=2 (after a_3=U)\n\nτ=5: y=3 (after a_4=U)\n\nτ=6: y=4 (after a_5=U)\n\nτ=7: y=5 (after a_6=U)\n\nτ=8: y=6 (after a_7=U)\n\nτ=9: y=7 (after a_8=U)\n\nτ=10: y=8 (after a_9=U)\n\nτ=11: y=9 (after a_10=U)\n\nNow, at τ=6: y=4, freeway 4. Is it blocked? At τ=6, freeway 4: earlier, blocked only at τ=2, so at τ=6, clear. Safe.\n\nAt τ=7: y=5, freeway 5, clear at τ=7, safe.\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, freeway 6, clear, safe.\n\nThen τ=9: y=7, freeway 7. At τ=9, is it blocked? Freeway 7 blocked at τ=6,7,8, so at τ=9, not blocked, safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=10: y=8, freeway 8, not blocked at τ=10, safe.\n\nτ=11: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions? τ from 0 to 10 inclusive for actions.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions, reaching y at τ=11.\n\nH = number of turns from start to end.\n\nWe start at τ=0, after H actions, at turn τ=H, position y_H.\n\nHere, after 11 actions, at τ=11, y=9.\n\nBut we used two actions to stay at start, and then 9 up moves, so 11 turns.\n\nBut is it minimal?\n\nWe could start moving earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, if we move up, y_1=1.\n\nBut at τ=2, we need to be at y=0 to avoid collision on y=1-6.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=1, which is safe since τ=1 not blocked.\n\nThen at τ=1, we need to go down to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nSo a_1 = D, then y_2=0.\n\nBut we moved up and down, so at τ=2, we are at y=0, same as before, but we used one extra action: a_0=U and a_1=D, instead of a_0=S and a_1=S.\n\nIn terms of position at τ=2, same, but we have two actions instead of two, but we have net zero progress, and same number of actions to reach higher y later.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=2, we still need 9 up moves to reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nIf we do a_0=U, a_1=D, then at τ=2, y=0, same as S,S.\n\nThen from there, same as above, reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut with S,S, we have a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2 to a_10 U, 11 actions.\n\nWith U then D, a_0=U, a_1=D, then a_2 to a_10 U? a_2 to a_10 is 9 actions, plus a_0 and a_1, total 11 actions, same.\n\nBut in U then D, at τ=1, we were at y=1, which was safe, but we didn't gain anything.\n\nSo better to just stay with S to save action, but both take same number.\n\nS or D, but D at y=0 is same as S.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we could be at higher y earlier, but at τ=2, we must be at y=0, so we cannot be higher.\n\nUnless we are at y=7 or 8 at τ=2, but impossible in two moves from y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can start moving up is from τ=2.\n\nThen, from y=0 at τ=2, to y=9, min 9 up moves, reaching at τ=11.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=11, y=9.\n\nBut τ=11 is turn t_1 + 11 = 50 + 11 = 61.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to avoid the other block at τ=6,7,8 for y=7,8.\n\nIn the above, at τ=6,7,8, we are at y=4,5,6, which are not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nWe could go faster, but we have to pass through all y, and we cannot skip levels, since we move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: after τ=2, we go up, but we might need to wait later to avoid y=7,8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nBut in the above, since at τ=6,7,8 we are at y=4,5,6, and y=7,8 later, it works.\n\nIf we go faster, but we start from y=0 at τ=2, we cannot reach y=9 before τ=11.\n\ny at τ=2: 0\n\nAfter 1 up, τ=3 y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 up, τ=11 y=9.\n\nSo minimum 9 moves after τ=2, so H=11 actions to reach at τ=11.\n\nBut τ=11 is the turn after H actions.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see the definition.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"after H-1 actions? No.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so H actions? Let's read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so indices from t1 to t1 + H-1, so H actions.\n\nThen \"reach (0,9)\", I think after the actions, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the update: after actions, position changes.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0, y_{t1})\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position at turn t1+1, and so on.\n\nAfter sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 (relative), we have actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after a_{t1+H-1}, position at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nIn terms of τ, at τ=H, y_H =9.\n\nIn our case, with τ=0 to 10 actions? Earlier.\n\nIn the plan: actions from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions, reaching at τ=11.\n\nτ=0: action a_0 (at turn t1)\n\n...\n\nτ=10: action a_{10} (at turn t1+10)\n\nThen position at τ=11, turn t1+11, y=9.\n\nSo H=11 turns? H is the number of actions? The sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen after that, at turn t1 + H, position.\n\nSo to have position at turn t1 + H be (0,9), we need H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn our case, with 11 actions, we reach at turn t1+11.\n\nBut we might do with less.\n\nFor example, if we start moving up earlier, but we cannot because at τ=2 we must be at y=0.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, we stay, y1=0\n\nThen at τ=1, we stay, y2=0\n\nThen from τ=2 to τ=10, we go up each time: actions at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: all U.\n\nThen positions:\n\nAfter a_2=U, at τ=3, y=1\n\na_3=U, τ=4, y=2\n\na_4=U, τ=5, y=3\n\na_5=U, τ=6, y=4\n\na_6=U, τ=7, y=5\n\na_7=U, τ=8, y=6\n\na_8=U, τ=9, y=7\n\na_9=U, τ=10, y=8\n\na_10=U, τ=11, y=9\n\nYes.\n\nActions: τ=0: S (or D, but S fine)\n\nτ=1: S\n\nτ=2: U\n\nτ=3: U\n\nτ=4: U\n\nτ=5: U\n\nτ=6: U\n\nτ=7: U\n\nτ=8: U\n\nτ=9: U\n\nτ=10: U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nBut at τ=8, position y=6, which is at turn τ=8.\n\nτ=8 is critical for y=7,8? τ=8 is one of τ=6,7,8? τ=6,7,8 are critical.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, which is not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nWe could reach y=9 earlier if we don't have to wait, but we must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 before τ=11, but from y=0 at τ=2, impossible to reach y=9 before τ=11.\n\ny=9 at τ=11 is earliest possible from that point.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can avoid the first wait.\n\nFor example, if at τ=2, we could be at y=7 or 8, but impossible.\n\nOr, we could go up slowly or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo 11 seems minimal.\n\nBut we have another issue: at τ=6,7,8, we need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn this plan, we are on y=4,5,6 at those times, safe.\n\nBut suppose we want to go faster, we cannot.\n\nPerhaps after τ=2, we can go up faster, but we move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: we might stay at some point to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nBut in this case, since we are below, it's fine.\n\nIf we were higher, we might need to wait, but here we are low.\n\nFor example, suppose from τ=2, y=0, we go up quickly, but we can't.\n\nOr, suppose we go up to y=6 quickly, but then at τ=6, if we are at y=6, safe, but if we go to y=7 earlier, it might be bad, but in this timing, we reach y=7 at τ=9, after the critical period.\n\nτ=9 is after τ=8, so safe.\n\nWe could delay going up to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nNow, but in freeway 7 and 8, blocked at τ=6,7,8, so we can be on them before or after.\n\nIn this plan, all good.\n\nBut is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=1 at τ=2, but y=1 is blocked at τ=2, so impossible.\n\nUnless we are not on y=1 at τ=2, but we have to be on some y.\n\nNo, at τ=2, we must not be on y=1-6, so only y=0,7,8,9 possible, but y=7,8,9 not reachable, so only y=0.\n\nThus, we must lose the first two turns to stay at 0.\n\nThen 9 turns to go up, total 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in fewer than 11 actions from start.\n\nBut with actions, min 9 up moves needed, but we need to spend two turns to stay at start, so 11.\n\nUnless we can move up during the first two turns without being on bad position at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, if we are on y=1, it is bad.\n\nFor example, if we move up at τ=0 to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, we need to go down to y=0 at τ=2, so we do D at τ=1.\n\nBut then at τ=2, y=0, same as before, and we used U and D, two actions, same as S and S.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut net, same number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nIf we move up at τ=0 to y=1, then at τ=1, if we stay, y=1 at τ=2, but y=1 is blocked at τ=2, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThus, H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, but we have the car on freeway 7 and 8 at τ=6,7,8, but in our path, we are not on them.\n\nNow, another thing: at τ=9, we are on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt τ=9, is it blocked? Freeway 7 blocked only at τ=6,7,8, so τ=9>8, not blocked.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAll clear.\n\nNow, for the actions: we need to specify for each turn.\n\nt1=50.\n\nActions from turn 50 to turn 60? Let's list.\n\nTurn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10.\n\nt=0: turn 50\n\nt=1: turn 51\n\n...\n\nt=10: turn 60\n\nThen at turn 61, position y=9.\n\nNow, actions:\n\nAt turn 50 (t=0): action S (to stay at y=0 for next turn)\n\nIn terms of action at turn.\n\nAt turn T, we take action a_T, which affects position at T+1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = S  (so that at turn 51, y=0)\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = S  (so that at turn 52, y=0)\n\nNow, turn 52: a_{52} = U  (to y=1 at turn 53)\n\nTurn 53: a_{53} = U  (to y=2 at turn 54)\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U  (to y=3 at turn 55)\n\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U  (to y=4 at turn 56)\n\nTurn 56: a_{56} = U  (to y=5 at turn 57)\n\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U  (to y=6 at turn 58)\n\nTurn 58: a_{58} = U  (to y=7 at turn 59)\n\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U  (to y=8 at turn 60)\n\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U  (to y=9 at turn 61)\n\nAt turn 61, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn 52 (τ=2), y=0, safe.\n\nAt turn 56 (τ=6), y=4? Turn 56 position: after action at turn 55, to turn 56.\n\nLet's list positions at each turn:\n\nTurn 50: y=0\n\nAfter a50=S, turn 51: y=0\n\nAfter a51=S, turn 52: y=0\n\nAfter a52=U, turn 53: y=1\n\nAfter a53=U, turn 54: y=2\n\nAfter a54=U, turn 55: y=3\n\nAfter a55=U, turn 56: y=4\n\nAfter a56=U, turn 57: y=5\n\nAfter a57=U, turn 58: y=6\n\nAfter a58=U, turn 59: y=7\n\nAfter a59=U, turn 60: y=8\n\nAfter a60=U, turn 61: y=9\n\nNow, critical turns:\n\nAt τ=2: turn 52, y=0, safe.\n\nAt τ=6: turn 56, y=4, freeway 4. At turn 56, τ=6, freeway 4 not blocked, safe.\n\nAt τ=7: turn 57, y=5, freeway 5, not blocked, safe.\n\nAt τ=8: turn 58, y=6, freeway 6, not blocked, safe.\n\nAt τ=9: turn 59, y=7, freeway 7. τ=9, not blocked (blocked only 6,7,8), safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 60, y=8, τ=10, safe.\n\nTurn 61, y=9, goal.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, but in the actions, at turn 50 and 51, we did S, but we could do D, same effect.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we do nothing for first two turns, then up.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=7 and 8 after τ=8.\n\nIn this case, we are on y=7 at τ=9, which is fine.\n\nIf we go slower, it would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point, but not necessary.\n\nSo H=11 should be minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7: car that covers at τ=6,7,8: the third car, with t=-35, h=-24, s=4.\n\nAt τ=6: span [-35 +4*6, -24 +4*6] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 0? 0 <= 0 is true, so covered.\n\nSimilarly τ=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nτ=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nAt τ=9: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, in our path, at τ=6,7,8, we are not on y=7 or 8, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions from turn 50 to turn 60.\n\nH=11 actions, turns 50 to 60.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 50: S\n\nTurn 51: S\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nIn the output format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 50: S Turn 51: S Turn 52: U Turn 53: U Turn 54: U Turn 55: U Turn 56: U Turn 57: U Turn 58: U Turn 59: U Turn 60: U }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=50.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 50: S\n\nTurn 51: S\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 61.\n\nBut is turn 60 the last action? After a_{60}, at turn 61, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving up at turn 51 or something.\n\nFor example, at turn 50: S, to turn 51 y=0\n\nThen turn 51: U, to turn 52 y=1, but at turn 52, y=1, which is blocked, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nTurn 50: U, to turn 51 y=1\n\nThen turn 51: D, to turn 52 y=0, safe, but then same as before, we have to go from y=0 at turn 52, same as above.\n\nThen actions: turn 50: U, turn 51: D, then turn 52: U, ..., up to turn 60: U, but after a_{60}=U, at turn 61 y=9, same H=11.\n\nBut with U then D, we have an extra pair, but same number.\n\nIn terms of sequence, S,S is simpler.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we covered that only one car blocks at τ=6,7,8.\n\nOthers don't affect.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in 10 actions.\n\nSuppose H=10, then after 10 actions, at turn 60, y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 60, we need to be at y=9 at turn 60.\n\nFrom start at turn 50 y=0, we need to increase y by 9 in 10 steps, but with constraints.\n\nAt turn 52 (τ=2), we must be at y=0.\n\nNow, from turn 50 to turn 52: two actions.\n\nTo be at y=0 at turn 52, as before.\n\nThen from turn 52 to turn 60: 8 actions? Turns: after actions.\n\nPosition at turn 52: y=0 (after actions at 50 and 51)\n\nThen we have actions at turn 52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59: 8 actions.\n\nAfter these, position at turn 60.\n\nWe need y=9 at turn 60.\n\nBut with 8 actions, from y=0, we can increase y by at most 8, to y=8, not 9.\n\nFor example, if all U, y at turn 60: after 8 up moves, from turn 52 y=0, after a52 U, turn53 y=1; ... after a59 U, turn60 y=8.\n\nThen we need another action to go to y=9, but at turn60, if we take action, it affects turn61.\n\nBut we want position at turn60 to be 9, but with actions up to a59, position at turn60 is y=8.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn60, we need to be at y=8 at turn59, then U at turn59 to turn60 y=9.\n\nBut at turn59, position y must be 8.\n\nNow, from turn52 y=0 to turn59 y=8, that takes 7 up moves? From turn52 to turn59: actions at turn52 to turn58 affect position up to turn59.\n\nPosition at turn59 is after action at turn58.\n\nSet:\n\nAt turn52: y=0\n\nAfter a52: to turn53\n\n...\n\nAfter a58: to turn59\n\nAfter a59: to turn60\n\nWe want y_{60} =9.\n\ny_{60} = y_{59} + Δy from a59\n\nTo have y_{60}=9, need y_{59}=8 and a59=U, or y_{59}=9 and a59=S or D, but better to have a59=U from 8.\n\nSimilarly, y_{59} depends on previous.\n\nNow, from turn52 y=0 to turn59 y=8.\n\ny_{59} is set by actions from turn52 to turn58.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn52 to turn58, 7 actions (52,53,54,55,56,57,58).\n\nWith 7 actions, from y=0, we can reach y=7 at turn59 if all U.\n\ny at turn52: 0\n\na52 U: turn53 y=1\n\na53 U: turn54 y=2\n\n...\n\na58 U: turn59 y=7? Actions: a52 to a58, that's 7 actions.\n\nAfter a52: turn53 y=1\n\nAfter a53: turn54 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a58: turn59 y=7\n\nThen to have y60=9, need a59=U, then y60=8, not 9.\n\ny60=8.\n\nThen we need another action to go to y=9, but that would be at turn61.\n\nIf at turn59, y=8, then a59=U, y60=9.\n\nBut with actions up to a59, we have 9 actions from turn52 to turn59? Let's count.\n\nActions to reach position at turn60.\n\nStart: turn50 y=0\n\na50 and a51 to have turn52 y=0: e.g., a50=S, a51=S\n\nThen actions a52 to a59: 8 actions (turns 52 to 59)\n\nAfter a52: turn53 y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a59: turn60 y=?\n\nIf all U from a52 to a59, 8 U, then y at turn53:1, turn54:2, ..., turn60:8\n\ny60=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn60, we need y59=8 and a59=U.\n\nBut y59=8 must be achieved by actions up to a58.\n\nFrom turn52 y=0 to turn59 y=8 with 7 actions: a52 to a58.\n\nWith 7 actions, max y=7 at turn59.\n\nThen a59=U, turn60 y=8, still not 9.\n\nTo have y59=8, we need to start earlier, but at turn52 we are at y=0.\n\nIf we had moved up before, but at turn52 we must be at y=0.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at turn60; earliest at turn61.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 50\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a blocked freeway at critical turns.\n\n- At turn 52 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), freeways 1 to 6 are blocked due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). The player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision.\n- At turns 56, 57, and 58 (\\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\)), freeways 7 and 8 are blocked. The player must not be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at these turns.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 50 with the player at \\(y = 0\\). Actions are chosen as follows:\n- Turns 50 and 51: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding any collision at turn 52.\n- Turns 52 to 60: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 61.\n\nThis path ensures:\n- At turn 52 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), \\(y = 0\\), which is safe.\n- At turns 56, 57, and 58 (\\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\)), the player is at \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) (freeways 4, 5, 6), which are not blocked at these turns.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are only occupied after turn 58, when they are no longer blocked.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 50 to 60 is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ U} }\n\nAfter these actions, at turn 61, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). No shorter sequence is possible due to the constraints at turn 52 and the need for 9 upward moves from \\(y = 0\\).",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) on turn t1 = 52. I need to get to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The actions are U (up), D (down), or S (stay), which change the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for each freeway at turn t1. For each car, I have head (h), tail (τ), direction (d), and speed (s). The direction is given as \"right\" for all cars, which I think means they're moving right, but according to the update rules, left-moving cars have spans that decrease, and right-moving have spans that increase.\n\nThe car update rules say:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving cars, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T, it's [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the input, for freeways 1 to 6, it's given as (h, τ, direction, speed). For example, freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). Since direction is right, Span(t1) should be [τ, h] according to the rule, so [ -83, -48 ]? But it says (head, tail), so I need to interpret head and tail.\n\nThe input says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". But in the update rule, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] meaning h to τ, and for right-moving, it's [τ, h].\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation. Let me clarify.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\n- For left-moving car: at t1, span is [h, τ], so h is the head and τ is the tail, and since it's moving left, head decreases.\n\n- For right-moving car: at t1, span is [τ, h], so τ is the tail and h is the head, moving right.\n\nIn the input, for all cars, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). So for a right-moving car, head h is the front, tail τ is the back.\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSince direction is right, according to update rule, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-83, -48], and at time T, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-83 + 36ΔT, -48 + 36ΔT].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor freeways 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, each with their own (h, τ, d, s).\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T. That is, if y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is between the start and end of its span at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action for next position, but collision is checked based on where you are at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at that turn.\n\nIn other words, at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. But collision is only checked for the row you are on at that exact turn.\n\nSo for collision at turn T: you are on y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in some car's span at time T.\n\nThe span is the x-position, and since the player is at (0, y), so collision if x=0 is within the car's span on row y at time T.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, starting at turn 52, position (0,0).\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars on those rows. Cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones, no cars.\n\nSo I need to traverse through rows 1 to 8 without being hit by cars when I'm on that row.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1, 0, or +1, but since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, and y is between 0 and 9, I probably want to go up most of the time, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nI can also stay or go down to wait, but since I want minimal turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nLet t1 = 52.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when the cars are at x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, collision happens at time T if y_T = k and 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, if any car on that row has 0 in span at T, collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I can find the time intervals when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen, for that freeway, the unsafe times are when at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nBut since I'm discrete in time, I need to find for each turn T, for each row, whether it's safe to be there.\n\nT is integer, I assume, since turns are discrete.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head h = -48, tail τ = -83, direction right, speed s=36.\n\nSince right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 52.\n\nSo Span(T) = [-83 + 36(T-52), -48 + 36(T-52)]\n\n0 is in this span if:\n\n-83 + 36(T-52) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36(T-52)\n\nSet L(T) = -83 + 36(T-52)\n\nU(T) = -48 + 36(T-52)\n\nThen 0 in [L(T), U(T)] if L(T) ≤ 0 and U(T) ≥ 0, since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nL(T) ≤ 0 ≤ U(T)\n\nNow, L(T) = -83 + 36(T-52) ≤ 0\n\n-83 + 36(T-52) ≤ 0\n\n36(T-52) ≤ 83\n\nT-52 ≤ 83/36 = 2.305... so T-52 ≤ 2 since T integer? 83/36 = 83÷36.\n\n36*2=72, 83-72=11, so 2 + 11/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-52 ≤ 2.305, so for T-52 <= 2, L(T) <=0? Let's compute inequality.\n\nL(T) <=0: -83 +36(ΔT) <=0, 36ΔT <=83, ΔT <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so since ΔT integer, ΔT <=2.\n\nSimilarly, U(T) >=0: -48 +36ΔT >=0, 36ΔT >=48, ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2 since integer.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 52.\n\nL(T) <=0: -83 +36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <= 83/36 = 2.305... so ΔT <=2 for integer ΔT.\n\nU(T) >=0: -48 +36ΔT >=0 => 36ΔT >=48 => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2.\n\nNow, for 0 to be in [L,U], we need L<=0 and U>=0.\n\nFor ΔT=2: L(2) = -83 +36*2 = -83 +72 = -11 <=0\n\nU(2) = -48 +72 = 24 >=0\n\nSo yes, 0 in span.\n\nFor ΔT=1: L(1) = -83 +36*1 = -83+36= -47 <=0\n\nU(1) = -48 +36 = -12 <0, so U<0, so 0 not >= U, so 0 not in span since U<0.\n\nFor ΔT=3: L(3) = -83 +36*3 = -83+108=25 >0, so L>0, U= -48+108=60>0, so 0 < L, not in span.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, which is T=54, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nΔT=2, T= t1 +2 =52+2=54.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36), so same as above, unsafe only at T=54.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36), unsafe only at T=54.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nh=-48, τ=-71, right, s=24\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-71 +24ΔT, -48 +24ΔT]\n\n0 in span if:\n\nL(T) = -71 +24ΔT <=0 and U(T) = -48 +24ΔT >=0\n\nL<=0: -71 +24ΔT <=0 => 24ΔT <=71 => ΔT <=71/24≈2.958, so ΔT<=2\n\nU>=0: -48 +24ΔT >=0 => 24ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo for ΔT=2: L= -71+48= -23<=0, U= -48+48=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor ΔT=1: L= -71+24= -47<=0, U= -48+24= -24<0, not >=0, so not in span.\n\nΔT=3: L= -71+72=1>0, U= -48+72=24>0, not <=0? L>0, so not in span.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, T=54.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, (-48,-71,right,24), unsafe at T=54.\n\nFreeway 6: same, unsafe at T=54.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nh=48, τ=37, right, s=4\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 +4ΔT, 48 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 37+4ΔT <=0 <=48+4ΔT\n\nBut 37+4ΔT >=37>0 for ΔT>=0, so L(T) =37+4ΔT >0, so 0 < L, not in span. So this car never has 0 in span, since min is 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nh=12, τ=1, right, s=4\n\nSpan(T) = [1 +4ΔT, 12 +4ΔT]\n\n1+4ΔT >=1>0, so always greater than 0, never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, right, s=4\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 +4ΔT, -24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if L<=0 and U>=0\n\nL = -35 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/4 = 8.75, so ΔT <=8\n\nU = -24 +4ΔT >=0 => 4ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nΔT=6: L= -35+24= -11 <=0, U= -24+24=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nΔT=7: L= -35+28= -7 <=0, U= -24+28=4 >=0, yes.\n\nΔT=8: L= -35+32= -3 <=0, U= -24+32=8 >=0, yes.\n\nΔT=5: L= -35+20= -15 <=0, U= -24+20= -4 <0, not >=0, no.\n\nΔT=9: L= -35+36=1>0, U= -24+36=12>0, no.\n\nSo for third car, unsafe when ΔT=6,7,8, i.e., T=52+6=58, 59, 60.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, since first two cars never unsafe, only the third car matters, so unsafe at T=58,59,60.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7, (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4), so same as above, unsafe at T=58,59,60.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=54\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=54\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=54\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=54\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=54\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=54\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=58,59,60\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=58,59,60\n\nAt other times, these freeways are safe, meaning no car at x=0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at turn 52, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, which changes y for the next turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nCollision is at turn T if y_T = k and freeway k is unsafe at T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at T=52, and y=0 has no cars, so safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe minimal H: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimal without any obstacles would be 9 turns, each up, so H=9, arriving at y=9 on turn 52+8=60? Let's see.\n\nStart turn 52: at y=0\n\nAfter action, at turn 53, y=1 if I go up, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken H steps, so at turn t1 + H, I am at position after H actions.\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nAt turn t1 = 52, position y_{52} = 0\n\nAfter action a_{52}, at turn 53, y_{53} = y_{52} + Δy_{52}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, y_t is position.\n\nI need to have y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the target is to reach (0,9), so y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 for the indices, but in terms of turns, actions applied at turns t1 to t1+H-1, resulting in positions from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nAt turn t1, I start at y_{t1}, then I take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to a_{t1+H-1}, which determines y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd I want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAlso, for collision, at each turn T from t1 to t1+H, I must not be in collision when on a freeway.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and it is unsafe at T, collision.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, safe.\n\nIn this case, t1=52, I start at y=0, so at turn 52, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nThen I take actions to move to y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I can go up each turn, so from turn 52 to turn 60: after 8 up actions, I reach y=8 at turn 60? Let's list:\n\nTurn 52: at y=0, take a_{52}, say U, then turn 53: y=1\n\nTurn 53: at y=1, take U, turn 54: y=2\n\n...\nAfter k up actions, at turn 52+k, y=k.\n\nTo reach y=9, need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 52+H, y=9.\n\nSo for minimal H, H=9, at turn 61, y=9.\n\nStart turn 52: y=0\n\nAfter 1st action (at t=52), turn 53: y=1\n\nAfter 2nd action (t=53), turn 54: y=2\n\n...\nAfter 8th action (t=59), turn 60: y=8\n\nAfter 9th action (t=60), turn 61: y=9\n\nSo to be at y=9 on turn 61, H=9 actions.\n\nWith obstacles, it might take more if I need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, with the unsafe times, I need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, for freeways 1-6, all unsafe at T=54.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at T=58,59,60.\n\nNow, since I need to go up, I should try to go directly up if possible.\n\nBut at T=54, if I am on any of y=1 to 6, I will collide, because all freeways 1-6 are unsafe at T=54.\n\nSimilarly, at T=58,59,60, if I am on y=7 or 8, collide.\n\nNow, T=54 is turn 54.\n\nI start at turn 52, y=0.\n\nI need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, minimal time might be possible if I can avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=54, I should not be on y=1 to 6.\n\nSo where can I be at T=54?\n\nOptions: y=0, or y=7,8,9 but I start from 0, so by T=54, I can be at most y=2 if I go up twice? Turn 52: y=0\n\nTurn 53: if U, y=1\n\nTurn 54: if U, y=2\n\nBut y=2 is freeway 2, unsafe at T=54.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or go down, but I want to go up.\n\nAt T=54, if I am at y=0, safe, or y=7,8,9.\n\nBut from turn 52 to 54, only two moves.\n\nTurn 52: start y=0\n\nAfter a_{52}, turn 53: y=1 or 0 (if S or D, but D to -1 not allowed, y min 0, so S or U.\n\nIf S, turn 53 y=0; if U, turn 53 y=1.\n\nThen at turn 53, take action, turn 54: if I was at y=0, I can go to y=0,1; if at y=1, to y=0,1,2.\n\nBut at T=54, I need to not be on y=1-6.\n\nSo possible to be at y=0 at T=54, by staying or moving down, but from y=1, I can go to y=0.\n\nBut I want to go up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, can I be at y=7 by T=54? Impossible, only two moves from y=0, max y=2.\n\nSo at T=54, I can only be at y=0,1,2 or less.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 and 2 are unsafe at T=54.\n\nSo to avoid collision, at T=54, I must be at y=0.\n\nTherefore, I need to be at y=0 at turn 54.\n\nThat means, from turn 52 to 54:\n\nAt turn 52, y=0, I must take action such that I am at y=0 at turn 54.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Stay at turn 52: S, then turn 53 y=0.\n\nThen at turn 53, if S, turn 54 y=0.\n\nOr if U, turn 54 y=1, but y=1 unsafe, so must S at turn 53.\n\nIf at turn 52 I go U, turn 53 y=1.\n\nThen at turn 53, to be at y=0 at turn 54, I must go D, so down to y=0.\n\nBut at turn 53, when I am at y=1, is it safe? Turn 53, y=1.\n\nNow, is freeway 1 unsafe at T=53?\n\nEarlier we have for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=54.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCheck T=53 for freeways.\n\nFor freeway 1: at T=53, ΔT=53-52=1\n\nL= -83 +36*1 = -47, U= -48+36= -12, both negative, U=-12<0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2-6, same as before, at ΔT=1, for freeway 1, U=-12<0, not unsafe; similarly for freeway 4, at ΔT=1, U=-24<0, not unsafe.\n\nSo at T=53, all freeways are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at other times except the specified.\n\nSo back to path.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=54, I can:\n\nOption 1: at turn 52, S, so turn 53 y=0. Then at turn 53, S, so turn 54 y=0.\n\nOption 2: at turn 52, U, so turn 53 y=1. Then at turn 53, D, so turn 54 y=0.\n\nIn both cases, I end at y=0 at turn 54.\n\nBut in option 2, at turn 53 I am at y=1, which is safe since T=53 not unsafe.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nAfter turn 54, I need to start going up.\n\nBut there are unsafe times later at T=58,59,60 for y=7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's get past T=54.\n\nNow, from turn 54, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe next obstacle is at T=58,59,60 for y=7 and 8.\n\nT=58,59,60.\n\nNow, from turn 54, I can start going up.\n\nEach up move increases y by one per turn.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal time from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, but I have to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=58,59,60.\n\nAlso, y=7 and 8 are unsafe only at those times, so at other times, safe to be there.\n\nNow, let me denote the turn when I am at certain y.\n\nSet t=54, y=0.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe unsafe turns for y=7 and 8 are 58,59,60.\n\nSo I should not be on y=7 at T=58,59,60 or on y=8 at those times.\n\nSince I go up one per turn if I always go up, but I might stay or move slower.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible except when I need to avoid.\n\nNow, from t=54, y=0.\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nTurn 54: at y=0, take U, turn 55: y=1\n\nTurn 55: at y=1, take U, turn 56: y=2\n\nTurn 56: at y=2, take U, turn 57: y=3\n\nTurn 57: at y=3, take U, turn 58: y=4\n\nTurn 58: at y=4, take U, turn 59: y=5\n\nTurn 59: at y=5, take U, turn 60: y=6\n\nTurn 60: at y=6, take U, turn 61: y=7\n\nTurn 61: at y=7, take U, turn 62: y=8\n\nTurn 62: at y=8, take U, turn 63: y=9\n\nNow, at which turns am I on freeways?\n\nAt turn t, I am on y_t.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 55: y=1\n\nTurn 56: y=2\n\nTurn 57: y=3\n\nTurn 58: y=4\n\nTurn 59: y=5\n\nTurn 60: y=6\n\nTurn 61: y=7\n\nTurn 62: y=8\n\nTurn 63: y=9, but y=9 safe.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nFirst, at T=58, I am on y=4. Freeway 4, is it unsafe at T=58?\n\nEarlier, freeway 4 unsafe only at T=54, which is past, so at T=58, safe. Similarly, all freeways 1-6 are safe except at T=54, which is before, so from T=55 onwards, freeways 1-6 are safe.\n\nT=54 was unsafe, but at T=55, for example, freeway 1: ΔT=55-52=3, L= -83+108=25>0, U= -48+108=60>0, not unsafe. Similarly, all safe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at T=58,59,60.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=61, I am on y=7, which is freeway 7.\n\nT=61, is it unsafe? Freeway 7 unsafe at T=58,59,60. T=61 is later, ΔT=61-52=9.\n\nFor freeway 7, third car, at ΔT=9, L= -35+36=1>0, not unsafe. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=62, y=8, freeway 8, ΔT=10, L= -35+40=5>0, safe.\n\nAnd T=63, y=9 safe.\n\nBut in this sequence, I reach y=9 at turn 63, which is after H=11 actions? Let's see from turn 54.\n\nStart turn 54, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 up actions: after a_{54} to a_{62}, turn 55 to 63: y=1 to 9.\n\nAt turn 63, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 54 to turn 62, 9 actions, turn 63 position.\n\nBut I need to include from start.\n\nIn this path, I have delays because I stayed or went down to avoid T=54.\n\nBut in the sequence above, from turn 54 onwards, I go up directly, and I am not on y=7 or 8 at T=58,59,60; at T=58 I am on y=4, safe; T=59 y=5, safe; T=60 y=6, safe.\n\nThen T=61 y=7, safe; T=62 y=8, safe; T=63 y=9.\n\nBut y=6 at T=60: freeway 6, which is safe since only unsafe at T=54.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at turn 63, with H=11 actions from start? Let's clarify the turns.\n\nStart: turn 52, y=0.\n\nTo avoid T=54 collision, I need to be at y=0 at T=54.\n\nAs I said, two options.\n\nTake option 1: stay at turn 52 and 53.\n\nTurn 52: S, so turn 53 y=0\n\nTurn 53: S, so turn 54 y=0\n\nNow from turn 54: as above.\n\nTurn 54: at y=0, U, turn 55 y=1\n\nTurn 55: U, turn 56 y=2\n\nTurn 56: U, turn 57 y=3\n\nTurn 57: U, turn 58 y=4\n\nTurn 58: U, turn 59 y=5\n\nTurn 59: U, turn 60 y=6\n\nTurn 60: U, turn 61 y=7\n\nTurn 61: U, turn 62 y=8\n\nTurn 62: U, turn 63 y=9\n\nNow, actions: from turn 52 to turn 62, actions a_{52} to a_{62}, 11 actions.\n\nAt turn 63, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so H=11.\n\nBut I could do the other option: go up and down.\n\nTurn 52: U, so turn 53 y=1 (safe, T=53)\n\nTurn 53: D, so turn 54 y=0 (safe)\n\nThen same as above from turn 54.\n\nTurn 54: U, turn 55 y=1\n\n... same sequence, still reach turn 63 y=9 with 11 actions.\n\nIn the go up and down, at turn 52: U, to y=1 at turn 53.\n\nThen turn 53: D, to y=0 at turn 54.\n\nThen from turn 54 same as before.\n\nNumber of actions: a_{52} to a_{62}, still 11 actions to reach y=9 at turn 63.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 53 I was at y=1, but safe.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nMinimal without obstacles is H=9, to be at y=9 at turn 61.\n\nBut to achieve that, I need to be at y=9 at turn 61.\n\nWith obstacles, at T=54, I must not be on y=1-6, so I need to be at y=0 at T=54, as before.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=54, to y=9 at minimal turn.\n\nFrom turn 54 y=0, to turn 61 y=9, that would be 7 moves: turn 55 y=1, ..., turn 61 y=7? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 54 y=0\n\nAfter 1st U (a_{54}), turn 55 y=1\n\n2nd U (a_{55}), turn 56 y=2\n\n3rd U (a_{56}), turn 57 y=3\n\n4th U (a_{57}), turn 58 y=4\n\n5th U (a_{58}), turn 59 y=5\n\n6th U (a_{59}), turn 60 y=6\n\n7th U (a_{60}), turn 61 y=7\n\nTo reach y=9, I need two more up, turn 61 y=7, U to y=8 at turn 62, U to y=9 at turn 63.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at turn 61 y=7, which is after T=60, so safe.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at turn 63.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose from turn 54, I go up faster, but I can only go one step per turn.\n\nUnless I start earlier, but I have to avoid T=54.\n\nAnother idea: at T=54, I must be at y=0, but after that, I can go up.\n\nBut the problem is that at T=58,59,60, y=7 and 8 are unsafe.\n\nIn my sequence, I am not on y=7 or 8 until T=61 and 62, which are after 60, so safe.\n\nBut can I be on y=7 or 8 before T=58 or after T=60?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at T=57 or earlier, or at T=61 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, from turn 54 y=0, the earliest I can be at y=7 is when?\n\nTurn 54: y=0\n\nTurn 55: y=1\n\nTurn 56: y=2\n\nTurn 57: y=3\n\nTurn 58: y=4\n\nTurn 59: y=5\n\nTurn 60: y=6\n\nTurn 61: y=7\n\nSo at turn 61, y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at turn 62.\n\nT=61 is after T=60, so safe.\n\nNow, T=58,59,60 are unsafe for y=7 and 8, but I am not there at those times.\n\nSo in this path, no problem, but I take 11 actions to reach y=9 at turn 63.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not going to y=0 at T=54, but I think I have to, because at T=54, if I am on y=1-6, I collide.\n\nUnless I am on y=7 or 8 at T=54, but impossible from y=0 in two moves.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother thought: I can stay longer at some point to avoid the later unsafe times, but that would make H larger, not smaller.\n\nTo minimize H, I should not stay.\n\nIn this case, with 11 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose I go up immediately at turn 52, but then at turn 54 I would be at y=2 if I go up twice, but y=2 unsafe at T=54.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf I go up once and stay: turn 52 U, turn 53 y=1\n\nThen turn 53, if I stay, S, turn 54 y=1, but y=1 unsafe at T=54, collision.\n\nIf I go down, turn 53 D, turn 54 y=0, safe.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to output the actions.\n\nIn the go up and down option, or stay stay.\n\nBut both take same number of turns.\n\nNow, for the later part, with freeway 7 and 8 unsafe at 58,59,60, but in my path, I am on y=7 at T=61, which is safe, etc.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 earlier?\n\nNo, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at the unsafe times, but since I am not on them at those times, it's fine.\n\nBut to save time, I should not go slower.\n\nIn this case, going directly up after T=54 is fine.\n\nBut let me check the unsafe times for y=7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at T=58,59,60.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=7 at T=61, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=62, safe.\n\nBut at T=60, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, another thing: can I reach y=9 before turn 63?\n\nFor example, if I start from turn 54 y=0, and go up every turn, I reach y=7 at turn 61, y=8 at 62, y=9 at 63.\n\nNo earlier.\n\nPerhaps if I am at higher y earlier, but I can't because I start from y=0 at turn 54.\n\nUnless I didn't have to go to y=0, but I did.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut let me think about the actions.\n\nStart turn 52: I can choose to S or U then D.\n\nIn terms of actions, both are fine.\n\nBut perhaps the U then D uses actions but same H.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need the sequence.\n\nBut I also need to consider if at some point I can skip waiting.\n\nAnother idea: after T=54, since freeways 1-6 are safe, I can go up fast, but I have to deal with y=7 and 8 later.\n\nBut in this case, since the unsafe times for y=7 and 8 are at T=58,59,60, and I am on y=7 at T=61, which is after, so no issue.\n\nSuppose I want to be on y=7 at T=57, for example.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nFrom turn 54 y=0:\n\nTurn 54 U, turn 55 y=1\n\nTurn 55 U, turn 56 y=2\n\nTurn 56 U, turn 57 y=3\n\nCan't be at y=7 at T=57.\n\nEarliest y=7 at T=61 as before.\n\nSimilarly, latest, but for minimal time, earliest is T=61 for y=7.\n\nBut at T=61, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at T=60, but T=60 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nIn my sequence, I avoid it.\n\nBut if I could be on y=8 at T=57, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the best.\n\nBut let me confirm the total turns.\n\nStart: turn 52, position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 52+H, position y=9.\n\nWith H=11, turn 63 y=9.\n\nSequence of actions: for example, using the stay-stay option.\n\nTurn 52: S  (so turn 53 y=0)\n\nTurn 53: S  (turn 54 y=0)\n\nThen turn 54: U  (turn 55 y=1)\n\nTurn 55: U  (turn 56 y=2)\n\nTurn 56: U  (turn 57 y=3)\n\nTurn 57: U  (turn 58 y=4)\n\nTurn 58: U  (turn 59 y=5)\n\nTurn 59: U  (turn 60 y=6)\n\nTurn 60: U  (turn 61 y=7)\n\nTurn 61: U  (turn 62 y=8)\n\nTurn 62: U  (turn 63 y=9)\n\nNow, at each turn, check collision:\n\nTurn 52: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 53: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 54: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 55: y=1, freeway 1, safe (not T=54)\n\nTurn 56: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nTurn 57: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nTurn 58: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nTurn 59: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nTurn 60: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nTurn 61: y=7, freeway 7, at T=61, ΔT=61-52=9, for freeway 7, third car, L=-35+4*9= -35+36=1>0, not unsafe, safe.\n\nTurn 62: y=8, freeway 8, ΔT=10, L=-35+40=5>0, safe.\n\nTurn 63: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith the other option: turn 52: U (to y=1 at turn 53)\n\nTurn 53: D (to y=0 at turn 54)\n\nThen same as above from turn 54: U,U,U,... to turn 62.\n\nActions: a_{52} to a_{62}, same H=11.\n\nIn this case, at turn 53, y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the go up-down, I have a down action, which might be less intuitive, but it's fine.\n\nSince both work, I can choose either.\n\nBut in terms of the car states, I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about freeway 7 and 8, I have multiple cars, but only the third one matters, as I considered.\n\nIn the sequence, I don't have issues.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster?\n\nSuppose at turn 54, I am at y=0, but instead of going up directly, I stay or something to avoid y=7 at later unsafe times, but since I am not there, it's fine, and staying would delay more.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for more turns, then I start later, reach y=9 later, H larger.\n\nSo not better.\n\nGo up slower, same.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 and 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=57, freeway 7: ΔT=5, for third car, L=-35+20=-15, U=-24+20=-4, both negative, not unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, safe.\n\nIn my path, I am at y=3 at T=57, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 61 if I didn't have the initial delay.\n\nBut I have to avoid T=54.\n\nUnless I can be at y=7 or 8 at T=54, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the action sequence starting from turn 52.\n\nAlso, H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, which is a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so for t1=52, a_{52} to a_{62}.\n\nIn the box.\n\nNow, I can write the sequence.\n\nLet me choose the stay-stay option to avoid down.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 52: S\n\nTurn 53: S\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nAfter a_{62}, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nIn this case, t_1=52, H=11, so from turn 52 to turn 62.\n\na_{52} to a_{62}.\n\nWith the sequence above.\n\nIn the go up-down:\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: D\n\nThen turn 54: U\n\n...\n\nSame from turn 54.\n\nBut at turn 53, I did D, which is down, but it's allowed.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects minimal actions, and both have 11.\n\nBut in the stay-stay, I have two S, which might be seen as waiting.\n\nBut it's ok.\n\nI think I'll go with stay-stay to keep it simple.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach with H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10, then at turn 52+10=62, y=9.\n\nBut to have y=9 at turn 62, I must have been at y=8 at turn 61, and so on.\n\nAt turn 52, y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, turn 62 y=9.\n\nThe position at turn T.\n\nAt turn 54, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from turn 54 y=0 to turn 62 y=9.\n\nThat would require increasing y by 9 in 8 turns? From turn 54 to turn 62 is 8 turns later, but positions.\n\nAt turn 54, y=0\n\nAfter actions a_{54} to a_{61}, I determine y_{55} to y_{62}.\n\nTo have y_{62}=9, with y_{54}=0.\n\nThe number of steps: from turn 55 to turn 62, 8 positions, but I need to go from y=0 to y=9, delta y=9, with 8 actions? Actions from a_{54} to a_{61}, 8 actions, to go from y_{54}=0 to y_{62}, which can be at most 8 if all up, so y_{62}=8, not 9.\n\nThen I need one more action to reach y=9.\n\nSo with 8 actions, I can reach y=8 at turn 62, then a_{62} U to y=9 at turn 63.\n\nThus, minimal to reach y=9 is 9 actions from any starting point, but since I start at y=0, and I have to be at y=0 at turn 54, which takes 2 actions to stay or move and come back, so total 2 + 9 =11 actions to reach y=9.\n\nIf I start from y=0 at turn 54, need 9 actions to y=9 at turn 63.\n\nPlus the two actions to get to turn 54 at y=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nI think I should write it clearly.\n\nSo for t1=52.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 52: S\n\nTurn 53: S\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 61: U to go from y=7 to y=8 at turn 62, then turn 62: U to y=9 at turn 63.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is S for turn 52\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} which is S for turn 53\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 10: a_{t_1 +10} which is U for turn 62? t1 + H -1 =52 +11-1=62.\n\nYes.\n\nt_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, I have three cars, but I only considered the third one, but the first two never unsafe, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 52\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times\nThe car states at turn \\(t_1 = 52\\) are given, and the unsafe times (when x=0 is occupied) for each freeway are calculated as follows:\n\n- **Freeways 1-6**: Each has a car that is unsafe only at turn \\(T = 54\\) (since \\(\\Delta T = T - 52 = 2\\) for all).\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 58, 59, 60\\) (due to the third car, with \\(\\Delta T = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 58, 59, 60\\) (same as freeway 7).\n\nAt all other times, the freeways are safe. The start position \\(y = 0\\) and target position \\(y = 9\\) are safe zones with no cars.\n\n### Path Planning\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player should reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible while avoiding collisions:\n- At turn \\(T = 54\\), the player must not be on freeways 1-6 (i.e., \\(y_{54} \\neq 1,2,3,4,5,6\\)). The only safe position at \\(T = 54\\) is \\(y = 0\\) (since from \\(y_{52} = 0\\), the player can reach at most \\(y = 2\\) by \\(T = 54\\)).\n- To be at \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 54\\):\n  - Option: Stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 52 and 53 (actions: S, S).\n- After \\(T = 54\\), freeways 1-6 are safe at all times except \\(T = 54\\) (which is avoided). Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at \\(T = 58, 59, 60\\), so the player must avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at these turns.\n- From \\(y_{54} = 0\\), the player can move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\):\n  - The sequence \\(y_{55} = 1, y_{56} = 2, \\dots, y_{63} = 9\\) ensures:\n    - At \\(T = 58\\), \\(y = 4\\) (safe, freeway 4).\n    - At \\(T = 59\\), \\(y = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5).\n    - At \\(T = 60\\), \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6).\n    - At \\(T = 61\\), \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 not unsafe at \\(T = 61\\)).\n    - At \\(T = 62\\), \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 not unsafe at \\(T = 62\\)).\n    - At \\(T = 63\\), \\(y = 9\\) (safe).\n\nThis path uses 11 actions (\\(H = 11\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63. No shorter path is possible because:\n- Avoiding \\(T = 54\\) requires being at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 54, which takes at least 2 actions from turn 52 (e.g., S,S or U then D).\n- From \\(y_{54} = 0\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 9 actions (since each U increases y by 1, and y must increase by 9).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=52}^{62}\\) (11 actions) is:\n\n- Turn 52: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 53)\n- Turn 53: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 54)\n- Turn 54: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 55)\n- Turn 55: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 56)\n- Turn 56: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57)\n- Turn 57: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 58)\n- Turn 58: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 59)\n- Turn 59: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 60)\n- Turn 60: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 61)\n- Turn 61: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 62)\n- Turn 62: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63)\n\nThis sequence achieves the target in minimal turns (\\(H = 11\\)) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 54 to (0,9) as quickly as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. I have to minimize the number of turns, so I should go up as much as possible, but I need to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars are on specific freeways, and they move left or right with a certain speed. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Also, when moving to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the y you're currently on.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T). At that turn, for freeway y_T, if there's a car with 0 in its span at turn T, collision occurs. If you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you're still on y_T for the collision check at turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\nFor freeways 1,2,3: each has one car: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nHead and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so since it's moving right, head is larger. Here, head is -48, tail is -83? That seems odd because -48 is greater than -83, so if it's moving right, the head should be on the right, so if head is -48 and tail is -83, that means tail is at -83, head at -48, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: each has (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: each has three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll cars are moving right, which means they are increasing in position.\n\nNow, the position is on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, we only care about when the car spans cover x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nSince collision is checked only when the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's define the span for a car at time t relative to t_1.\n\nt_1 is current turn, 54.\n\nSo for any turn T, delta_t = T - 54.\n\nThen for a car, if right-moving, span at T is [tau + s * delta_t, h + s * delta_t] for the head and tail given.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T: [h - s (T-t_1), tau - s (T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: [tau + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for a car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so at t_1, position is [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nLook at the rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), but in the rule, for right-moving, Span(t_1) is [tau, h], so tau is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSo here, it's (head, tail) or (tail, head)? The notation says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\"\n\nSo for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [tau, h] = [-83, -48] at turn t_1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt turn T, Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)] = [-83 + 36 delta_t, -48 + 36 delta_t] for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same car: (-48, -83, right, 36) so same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 4: head -48, tail -71, right, 24, so Span(t_1) = [-71, -48], Span(T) = [-71 + 24 delta_t, -48 + 24 delta_t]\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 same as 4.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFor each, right-moving, so:\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, so Span(t_1) = [37,48], Span(T) = [37 + 4 delta_t, 48 + 4 delta_t]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, Span(t_1) = [1,12], Span(T) = [1 + 4 delta_t, 12 + 4 delta_t]\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, Span(t_1) = [-35,-24], Span(T) = [-35 + 4 delta_t, -24 + 4 delta_t]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as 7.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k at turn T and for some car on k, 0 is in Span(T), i.e., the interval contains 0.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, the span is moving right, so for each car, we can find when it covers x=0.\n\nSpecifically, for a span [L, U] at time T, it contains 0 if L <= 0 <= U.\n\nNow, L and U depend on delta_t.\n\nSet delta_t = T - 54.\n\nFor freeway 1: Span(T) = [-83 + 36 delta_t, -48 + 36 delta_t]\n\nContains 0 if -83 + 36 delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 36 delta_t\n\nWhich is 36 delta_t <= 83 and 36 delta_t >= 48? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-83 + 36 delta_t <= 0 => 36 delta_t <= 83 => delta_t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\n0 <= -48 + 36 delta_t => 36 delta_t >= 48 => delta_t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo for delta_t in [4/3, 83/36] approximately [1.333, 2.305], but since delta_t integer, T integer, delta_t integer.\n\ndelta_t is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nT - t_1 is integer, so delta_t integer.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision when delta_t >= ceil(48/36) and delta_t <= floor(83/36)\n\n48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, ceil(1.333) = 2\n\n83/36 ≈ 2.305, floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo delta_t from 2 to 2 inclusive? Let's see:\n\ndelta_t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since integer, delta_t >= 2\n\ndelta_t <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so delta_t <= 2\n\nThus delta_t = 2\n\nSimilarly, for other inequalities.\n\n-83 + 36 delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 36 delta_t\n\nLeft: -83 +36d <=0 => 36d <=83 => d <= 83/36=2.305, so d<=2 since integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +36d => 36d >=48 => d>=48/36=4/3=1.333, so d>=2\n\nThus d=2.\n\nSo at delta_t=2, which is T=54 +2=56, freeway 1 has a car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2 and 3, same car, same thing, so also at T=56, collision on y=1,2,3 if player is there.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24) head=-48, tail=-71\n\nSpan(T) = [-71 +24 delta_t, -48 +24 delta_t]\n\nContains 0 if -71 +24 delta_t <=0 <= -48 +24 delta_t\n\nLeft: -71+24d <=0 => 24d <=71 => d <=71/24≈2.958, so d<=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +24d => 24d >=48 => d>=2\n\nThus d=2\n\nSo at T=56, freeway 4 also has collision.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same, so at T=56, y=4,5,6 also have collision.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) Span(T) = [37 +4 delta_t, 48 +4 delta_t]\n\nContains 0 if 37+4d <=0 <=48+4d? But 37+4d >=37>0 for d>=0, so 0 <= 37+4d always true since min at d=0 is 37>0, and 37+4d <=0 only if d large negative, not possible. So this car never covers x=0 because its left end is at least 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4) Span(T) = [1 +4 delta_t, 12 +4 delta_t]\n\nContains 0 if 1+4d <=0 <=12+4d\n\nLeft: 1+4d <=0 => 4d <=-1, impossible since d>=0, 1+4d >=1>0, so never <=0. Thus never contains 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35, Span(T) = [-35 +4 delta_t, -24 +4 delta_t]\n\nContains 0 if -35 +4d <=0 <= -24 +4d\n\nLeft: -35+4d <=0 => 4d <=35 => d <=35/4=8.75, so d<=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +4d => 4d >=24 => d>=6\n\nSo for d from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nThus at delta_t=6,7,8, which is T=54+6=60, 61,62\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so same times.\n\nNow, are there any other cars? Freeways 1 to 8, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 54.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at intermediate points.\n\nAt turn 54, player is at (0,0), which is safe since no cars on y=0.\n\nNow, we need to move to higher y.\n\nThe collisions we have: at T=56, which is turn 56, freeways y=1,2,3,4,5,6 all have collisions at x=0.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5,6 at T=56.\n\nT=56 is delta_t=2.\n\nAlso, for y=7 and 8, collisions at T=60,61,62.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 have cars, but collisions only at specific times.\n\nNow, since we start at turn 54, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9.\n\nStart at t=54, position y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=54, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=55, y could be 0,1, or -1, but y>=0, so if a=S, y=0; a=U, y=1; a=D, y=0 if y=0, but since y=0, D would make y=-1, but y must be in [0,9], so probably y_{t+1} = clamp(y_t + delta, 0,9), but in the update, it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, -1) =0, I assume. Similarly at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nSo for y=0, D and S both keep y=0, U moves to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U and S keep y=9, D moves to y=8.\n\nBut in this case, starting at y=0, to go to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, taking 9 turns to reach.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous times and positions.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T=56 (delta_t=2), if player is on y=1,2,3,4,5,6, collision.\n\nT=56 is 2 turns from now.\n\nTurn t=54: current\n\nt=55: after one action\n\nt=56: after two actions\n\nAt t=56, if player is on y=1 to 6, collision.\n\nAlso, later at t=60,61,62, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nt=60 is delta_t=6, etc.\n\nNow, player starts at t=54, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe direct path: go up every turn.\n\nSequence: at t=54: y=0\n\nt=55: after U, y=1\n\nt=56: after U, y=2\n\nBut at t=56, y=2, which is one of the collision freeways (1-6), so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=1 at t=55, then at t=56 y=2, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince at t=56, y=1-6 are all dangerous, we must not be on those at t=56.\n\nPossible positions at t=56: after two actions from t=54.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut at y=0, D and S both keep y=0.\n\nSo possible:\n\n- Two S: stay at y=0\n\n- S then U: at t=55 y=0 (after S), then at t=56 after U, y=1\n\n- U then S: at t=55 y=1, then at t=56 after S, y=1\n\n- U then U: at t=55 y=1, t=56 y=2\n\n- U then D: at t=55 y=1, t=56 y=0 (since y=1 D to y=0)\n\n- Similarly, D then anything, but D at y=0 does nothing, same as S.\n\nSo essentially, from y=0 at t=54, after two actions to t=56, possible y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are dangerous at t=56, so only safe if y=0 at t=56.\n\nThat means we must be at y=0 at turn 56 to avoid collision.\n\nHow? By not moving up in the first two moves.\n\nFor example: do S at t=54 and S at t=55, then at t=56 y=0.\n\nOr S and then D, but D at y=0 does nothing, so y=0.\n\nOr D and S, same.\n\nBut not U in first or second action.\n\nSpecifically, if we do U at t=54, then at t=55 y=1, then at t=56, if we do S or D, y=1 or 0; if U, y=2. But y=1 at t=56 is dangerous, so only if we do D to go to y=0, but y=1 D to y=0.\n\nBut if we go to y=1 at t=55, then at t=56 we must go down to y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nBut that might not be efficient.\n\nThe only way to be safe at t=56 is to be at y=0.\n\nSo we must have y_{56} = 0.\n\nThat means from t=54 to t=56, we stay at y=0, so actions: a_{54} = S or D, but D same as S, and a_{55} = S or D.\n\nNow, after that, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut now at t=56, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum 9 more turns, but there might be other obstacles.\n\nAlso, later at t=60,61,62, y=7 and 8 have collisions.\n\nt=60 is turn 60, which is 6 turns from now, but from t=56.\n\nSet t=56 as new reference if needed.\n\nCurrent turn t=56, y=0.\n\nTime from now: let tau = T - 56.\n\nAt T=60, which is 4 turns later? t=56,57,58,59,60: so from t=56 to t=60 is 4 steps? Let's see:\n\nAt turn T, delta from t_1=54.\n\nBut t_1=54, T=60, delta_t=6.\n\nSimilarly, t=56 is delta_t=2 from start.\n\nBut for y=7 and 8, collisions at delta_t=6,7,8, which is T=60,61,62.\n\nNow, from current position at t=56, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times for y=7 and 8 are at t=60,61,62.\n\nt=60 is 4 turns from t=56: t=56,57,58,59,60 → 4 actions to go from t=56 to t=60.\n\nAfter k actions, time increases by k.\n\nAt time t, after action, position at t+1.\n\nStart at t=56, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions: t=56, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: t=57, y=?\n\nAfter 2 actions: t=58, y=?\n\nAfter 3 actions: t=59, y=?\n\nAfter 4 actions: t=60, y=?\n\nSimilarly, t=61 after 5 actions from t=56, etc.\n\nNow, at t=60, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=61, t=62.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at those times.\n\nSince we need to go to y=9, we might pass through y=7 and 8 at some point.\n\nBut we can time it so that when we are on y=7 or 8, it's not at t=60,61,62.\n\nThe collision times are fixed.\n\nFirst, let's see the minimum time to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 up moves, so minimum 9 turns.\n\nBut we might have to wait or detour.\n\nIn this case, at the beginning, we had to wait 2 turns to avoid t=56 collision, so we are already delayed.\n\nAt t=56, y=0, after 2 actions from start, but we used 2 actions to stay, so position same as start.\n\nNow from t=56, y=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum 9 actions to go up directly, reaching y=9 at t=56 + 9 = t=65.\n\nt=56 after 2 actions, so from t=54, after 11 actions to reach y=9 at t=65.\n\nBut we might be able to go faster if we avoid the later collisions.\n\nNow, during the ascent, we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at t=60,61,62.\n\nt=60,61,62 correspond to delta_t=6,7,8 from start.\n\nFrom t=56, which is t=54+2, so t=60 is t=56+4, etc.\n\nNow, suppose we start from t=56, y=0, and go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to check when we reach each y.\n\nLet me define the turn from t=56 onwards.\n\nSet t' = T - 56, so at t'=0, y=0.\n\nThen at time t' (from t=56), the absolute turn is T = 56 + t'.\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nFor y=7 and 8, collision when T=60,61,62, which is t'=4,5,6.\n\nBecause T=60 when t'=4, T=61 t'=5, T=62 t'=6.\n\nSo at t'=4,5,6, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn from t'=0.\n\nThen:\n\nt'=0: y=0 (after 0 actions)\n\nAction at t'=0: U, then at t'=1, y=1\n\nAction at t'=1: U, t'=2, y=2\n\nAction at t'=2: U, t'=3, y=3\n\nAction at t'=3: U, t'=4, y=4\n\nAction at t'=4: U, t'=5, y=5\n\nAction at t'=5: U, t'=6, y=6\n\nAction at t'=6: U, t'=7, y=7\n\nAction at t'=7: U, t'=8, y=8\n\nAction at t'=8: U, t'=9, y=9\n\nNow, at t'=4, y=4, which is not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nt'=5, y=5, safe\n\nt'=6, y=6, safe\n\nt'=7, y=7, but t'=7 corresponds to T=56+7=63, which is not 60,61,62, so no collision for y=7 at that time.\n\nSimilarly t'=8, y=8, T=64, not 60-62, safe.\n\nt'=9, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, we are never on y=7 or 8 during t'=4,5,6.\n\nAt t'=4, y=4; t'=5, y=5; t'=6, y=6; all below 7.\n\nThen at t'=7, y=7, T=63, which is after t=62, so no car at x=0 for y=7 or 8, since collisions only at t=60,61,62.\n\nFor y=7, cars cover x=0 only at t=60,61,62, so at t=63, not covered, similarly for y=8.\n\nIn fact, for the third car on y=7, at delta_t=6,7,8: T=60,61,62.\n\nAt T=63, delta_t=9, -35 +4*9= -35+36=1, -24+36=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars never cover 0.\n\nSo at t=63, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo in the above sequence, from t'=0 to t'=9, we go directly to y=9 without encountering any collision points.\n\nNow, back to absolute turns.\n\nFrom start: at t=54, y=0\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at t=56 to avoid collision.\n\nSo actions:\n\nt=54: must do S or D to stay at y=0. Since D same, let's say S.\n\nt=55: similarly, S to stay at y=0.\n\nThen at t=56, y=0.\n\nNow from t=56, we start going up.\n\nt=56: action U, to go to y=1 at t=57\n\nAt t=56, after action? Let's sequence properly.\n\nAt time t, before action, position is given, then we choose action, then position updates for next turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1 =54: player position (0,0), then we choose action a_{54}\n\nThen at turn 55, position is updated based on a_{54}, then choose a_{55}, and so on.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn 54: position (0,0), choose a_{54}\n\nThen position at turn 55: y_{55} = y_{54} + Delta y_{54}\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo have y_{56} =0.\n\ny_{56} depends on actions from t=54 and t=55.\n\ny_{56} = y_{55} + Delta y_{55}\n\nBut y_{55} = y_{54} + Delta y_{54} = 0 + Delta y_{54}\n\nSo y_{55} = Delta y_{54} , which can be 0 or 1 (since at y=0, D or S gives 0, U gives 1)\n\nThen y_{56} = y_{55} + Delta y_{55}\n\nIf y_{55}=0, then y_{56} = 0 + Delta y_{55} = 0 or 1\n\nIf y_{55}=1, then y_{56} =1 + Delta y_{55}, which can be 0,1,2\n\nBut we need y_{56}=0.\n\nCases:\n\n- If we set Delta y_{54} =0 (S or D), then y_{55}=0\n\nThen to have y_{56}=0, we need Delta y_{55}=0 (S or D)\n\n- If we set Delta y_{54}=1 (U), then y_{55}=1\n\nThen to have y_{56}=0, we need Delta y_{55}= -1 (D), so y_{56}=1 + (-1)=0\n\nBut if we go up at t=54 to y=1 at t=55, then down at t=55 to y=0 at t=56, we end up at y=0 same as staying, but we used an up and down, which is wasteful, since we don't gain any progress.\n\nWhereas if we stay both times, we save actions.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, it's better to stay than to go up and down, because going up and down leaves us at same position but used two actions, whereas staying uses two actions but no progress, same.\n\nBut in this case, since we need to go to y=9 eventually, the net up moves needed is 9, so any down move would require extra up moves, so it increases the number of actions.\n\nTherefore, to minimize H, we should avoid down moves, and only go up or stay when necessary.\n\nIn this case, to be safe at t=56, we should stay at y=0 for the first two turns.\n\nSo a_{54} = S\n\na_{55} = S\n\nThen at t=56, y=0.\n\nNow from t=56, we go up every turn.\n\na_{56} = U → at t=57, y=1\n\na_{57} = U → t=58, y=2\n\na_{58} = U → t=59, y=3\n\na_{59} = U → t=60, y=4\n\na_{60} = U → t=61, y=5\n\na_{61} = U → t=62, y=6\n\na_{62} = U → t=63, y=7\n\na_{63} = U → t=64, y=8\n\na_{64} = U → t=65, y=9\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt t=60, y=4, freeway 4, but at t=60, delta_t=6 from start.\n\nFor freeway 4, we had collision only at t=56, not at other times.\n\nAt t=56, delta_t=2, collision for y=1-6.\n\nAt t=60, delta_t=6, for freeway 4: car Span(T) = [-71 +24 delta_t, -48 +24 delta_t]\n\nAt delta_t=6: -71 +24*6 = -71 + 144 = 73, -48 +144=96, so [73,96], 0 not in, since min 73>0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3: at delta_t=6, [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168], 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision at t=60 for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=61, y=5, freeway 5, same as above, [ -71+24*7, -48+24*7] for y=5, but y=5 has same car as y=4? No, freeway 4,5,6 each have separate cars, but same parameters.\n\nFreeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24), so at T=61, delta_t=7, Span: [-71+24*7, -48+24*7] = [-71+168, -48+168] = [97,120], not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly y=6 same.\n\nNow at t=62, y=6, similar, Span: [-71+24*8, -48+24*8] = [-71+192, -48+192] = [121,144], no.\n\nNow at t=63, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt t=63, delta_t=9.\n\nFor freeway 7, cars: only the third car could have covered 0, but at delta_t=6,7,8: T=60,61,62.\n\nAt delta_t=9: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not cover.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=64, y=8, similar, safe.\n\nt=65, y=9, safe.\n\nSo this sequence works, and we reach y=9 at t=65.\n\nH is the number of actions? The sequence of actions from t=54 to t=54+H-1, and at t=54+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, actions from t=54 to t=64, that's 11 actions: t=54,55,...,64.\n\nt=54: a_{54}\n\nt=55: a_{55}\n\n...\n\nt=64: a_{64}\n\nAfter a_{64}, at t=65, y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at t=64, and we are at y=9 at t=65.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t to t+H-1, and position at t+H-1 is after the last action.\n\nStart at turn t_1=54, position given before actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is after H actions.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at some turn, say T, and T = t_1 + H - 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, before action, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter first action, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + k} = 9 for some k.\n\nAnd k is the number of actions taken, so H = k.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at t_1 + H, position y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be a sequence of actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn this case, with H=11, we reach at t=54+11=65? t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=54, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet to 9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=65, y=9, which is after 11 actions from t=54.\n\nActions at t=54 to t=64, 11 actions.\n\nBut can we do with fewer?\n\nEarlier I thought minimum is 9, but we had to wait 2 turns, so 11 might be minimal?\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by not staying all time.\n\nFor example, if at t=56 we are at y=0, but we started from y=0 at t=54.\n\nBut we must be at y=0 at t=56, so we cannot be higher.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 at t=56, but since we start at y=0, going down is not possible, or stay.\n\nSo we must lose at least 2 turns to be at y=0 at t=56.\n\nThen from there, 9 up moves, total 11 actions.\n\nBut perhaps during the ascent, we can adjust to avoid the y=7,8 collisions, but in this case, since we go up slowly, we are not on y=7 or 8 at t=60,61,62.\n\nt=60 is after 6 actions from start? Let's see the timing.\n\nt=54: start y=0\n\nt=55: after a_{54}, if U, y=1; S, y=0\n\netc.\n\nIn our sequence, we have:\n\nt=54: S, y=55=0 (after action)\n\nt=55: S, y=56=0\n\nt=56: U, y=57=1\n\nt=57: U, y=58=2\n\nt=58: U, y=59=3\n\nt=59: U, y=60=4\n\nt=60: U, y=61=5\n\nt=61: U, y=62=6\n\nt=62: U, y=63=7\n\nt=63: U, y=64=8\n\nt=64: U, y=65=9\n\nNow, at t=60, y=4, not 7 or 8.\n\nt=61, y=5\n\nt=62, y=6\n\nt=63, y=7, which is after t=62, so safe.\n\nBut t=62 is when y=6, not 7 or 8.\n\nThe dangerous times for y=7 and 8 are t=60,61,62.\n\nAt t=63, y=7, not dangerous.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTotal actions: from t=54 to t=64, 11 actions.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we try to be at higher y at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=56, we must be at y=0, no choice.\n\nThen from there, if we go up faster, but we can only go one step per turn.\n\nUnless we were higher earlier, but we can't because at t=55, if we go to y=1, then at t=56 we must be at y=0 to avoid collision, so we have to go down, but then we lose progress.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=54: U, then y=55=1\n\nt=55: D, then y=56=0 (since from y=1 down to y=0)\n\nThen at t=56, y=0, same as before.\n\nThen we need to go up to y=9, same as before, but we used an extra down move, so to compensate, we need an extra up move, so we reach later.\n\nt=56: y=0\n\nThen same sequence to y=9 at t=65, but we have one extra action: t=54 U, t=55 D, then from t=56 U to t=64 U, but t=64 U to y=65=9, so actions at t=54 to t=64, same 11 actions, but we have a down move which is useless.\n\nWorse or same, but same number, but with down move, which might not be necessary.\n\nIn the first sequence, no down move.\n\nSo better to stay.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before t=65.\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately after t=56.\n\nBut from t=56 y=0, minimum to y=9 is 9 actions, to t=65.\n\nt=56 +9 = t=65.\n\nSince we start at t=54, and must be at y=0 at t=56, we cannot start going up before.\n\nAt t=55, if we go up, we get to y=1 at t=55, but then at t=56 we have collision if we stay or go up, or we go down to avoid.\n\nBut if we go down, we are back to y=0 at t=56, same as staying.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think 11 is the minimum.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=57, y=1 in our sequence.\n\nAt t=57, delta_t=3 from start.\n\nFor y=1, freeway 1: Span at T=57, delta_t=3: [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in, since min 25>0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, all cars have moved away.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nAnd for y=7 and 8, we are on them at t=63 and t=64, which are safe.\n\nt=63: y=7, delta_t=9, as before, not covered.\n\nt=64: y=8, delta_t=10, for freeway 8, third car: [-35+4*10, -24+4*10] = [-35+40, -24+40] = [5,16], not contain 0.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 54: S\n\nTurn 55: S\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nAfter Turn 64 action, at turn 65, y=9.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=54 to t=64, 11 turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nHere t_1=54, H=11, so actions from turn 54 to turn 54+10=64.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 54 + 11 -1 = 64.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have S at 54 and 55, then U all the way.\n\nBut at the end, when reaching y=9, we can stop, but since we need to be at y=9, and we arrive at t=65 after the last action.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 64, we do U to go to y=9 at t=65.\n\nBut is there a way to arrive earlier?\n\nSuppose we don't stay both times, but only one stay, but we can't because at t=56, if we are at y=1 or 2, collision.\n\nUnless we are at y=7 or something, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: the collision at t=56 is only for y=1-6, but y=0 and y=7,8,9 are safe.\n\nBut at t=56, if we could be at y=7, but from y=0 at t=54, in two moves, we can be at most y=2, so y=7 impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 before t=65 by taking a different path, but since we have to go through lower y first, and we must avoid t=56 for y=1-6, I think not possible.\n\nMoreover, for y=7 and 8, the dangerous times are later, but since we pass them after t=62, it's fine.\n\nBut to reach earlier, suppose we start going up immediately, but then we hit collision at t=56 if we are on y=1-6.\n\nFor example, if we go up at t=54 to y=1 at t=55.\n\nThen at t=55, if we go up, to y=2 at t=56, collision.\n\nIf we stay, y=1 at t=56, but y=1 is dangerous at t=56.\n\nIf we go down, to y=0 at t=56, safe, but then we are at y=0 at t=56, same as before, but we used an up and down, so net zero progress, but we need to make up for the down move.\n\nThen from t=56 y=0, we need 9 up moves to y=9 at t=65.\n\nBut actions: t=54 U, t=55 D, t=56 U, ..., up to t=64 U to y=65=9.\n\nSo actions at t=54 to t=64, same 11 actions, but with a down move, whereas in the first sequence, we have two S, which might be better, but S is also an action, same number.\n\nIn terms of number, same H=11.\n\nBut with S, we don't move, with D we move down but here from y=0, D same as S.\n\nSo equivalent.\n\nBut in the sequence, better to have S than D to avoid unnecessary movement.\n\nSo first sequence is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 earlier by going through other freeways faster, but no, all freeways require moving up step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 have dangerous times only at t=60,61,62, perhaps we can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=7 before t=60 or after t=62.\n\nIn our sequence, we reach y=7 at t=63, which is after.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFrom start, if we could go faster to higher y, but we are blocked at the beginning.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 for one turn, then go up.\n\nBut at t=55, if we do S, y=55=0\n\nThen at t=55, we can do U, to y=56=1\n\nBut at t=56, y=1, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we do S at t=55, y=56=0, same as before.\n\nSo no way to be at y>0 at t=56 safely.\n\nThus, we must have y=0 at t=56.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars, but only the third one can cover x=0, at t=60,61,62.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nAnd we avoid being on y=7 or 8 at those times.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=7 at t=63, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=64, safe.\n\nNow, about freeway 6, for example, at t=62, we are on y=6.\n\nAt t=62, delta_t=8.\n\nFreeway 6: car (-48,-71,right,24), Span: [-71+24*8, -48+24*8] = [-71+192, -48+192] = [121,144], not contain 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other points are safe.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence is:\n\nTurn 54: S\n\nTurn 55: S\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nWith H=11.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nt_1=54.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: S\n\nTurn 55: S\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn 65.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at turn 64.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t from 0 to H-1.\n\nHere t_1=54, H=11, so actions for t=54 to t=54+10=64.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, it has multiple cars, but we considered only the one that could cause collision.\n\nOthers don't cover x=0 at any time, so fine.\n\nAlso, for freeways 1-6, after t=56, they don't cover x=0 again, since moving right away.\n\nSo no other dangers.\n\nThus, this should be minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can save one turn by going directly, but I don't see how.\n\nSuppose at t=56 we are at y=0, and we go up, but if we could skip some, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=60,61,62, y=7 and 8 are dangerous, but if we are on y=9 before that, but y=9 is safe, but to reach y=9 by t=61, for example.\n\nt=61 is delta_t=7.\n\nFrom t=54 y=0, to reach y=9 at turn T, need at least T=54+9=63 if we go up every turn, but we cannot because of t=56.\n\nFor example, if we go up at t=54 to y=1 at t=55.\n\nThen at t=55, we must go down to y=0 at t=56 to avoid collision.\n\nThen at t=56 y=0.\n\nThen go up: t=56 U to y=1 t=57\n\nt=57 U to y=2 t=58\n\nt=58 U to y=3 t=59\n\nt=59 U to y=4 t=60\n\nt=60 U to y=5 t=61\n\nt=61 U to y=6 t=62\n\nt=62 U to y=7 t=63\n\nt=63 U to y=8 t=64\n\nt=64 U to y=9 t=65\n\nSame as before, but we have an extra down at t=55.\n\nReach same time.\n\nIf at t=55 after going up to y=1, we cannot stay or go up without collision at t=56, so must go down or stay, but stay y=1 at t=56 collision, so must go down to y=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 54 with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must avoid being on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 56 (due to collisions from all cars on these freeways) and freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 60, 61, and 62 (due to collisions from the third car on each freeway).\n\n- At turn 56 (2 turns after turn 54), being on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) causes a collision. Therefore, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 56. This requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns (turns 54 and 55) with actions \\(S\\) (stay).\n- From turn 56 onwards, the player moves up (\\(U\\)) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. This sequence avoids \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) during turns 60, 61, and 62:\n  - At turn 60, the player is at \\(y = 4\\).\n  - At turn 61, the player is at \\(y = 5\\).\n  - At turn 62, the player is at \\(y = 6\\).\n- The player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 63 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 64, which are after the dangerous turns (60, 61, 62) and thus safe. The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 65.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11, with actions from turn 54 to turn 64. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- Turn 54: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 55: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 56: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 57)\n- Turn 57: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 58)\n- Turn 58: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 59)\n- Turn 59: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 60)\n- Turn 60: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 61)\n- Turn 61: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 62)\n- Turn 62: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 63)\n- Turn 63: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 64)\n- Turn 64: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 65)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 56. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway k (y_T = k) and the x=0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left by s per turn, and for right-moving, it shifts right by s per turn.\n\nIn this case, all cars are moving right, since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at turn t_1=56 is [τ, h] = [-83, -48]. Direction right, so head is larger, so span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe span moves right by s per turn. So at turn T, the position is shifted by s * (T - t_1).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars: each has three cars.\n\nFor freeway 7: cars are (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, and needs to get to y=9. Since y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there, I assume. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player is at (0,0) at turn t_1=56, which is y=0, so no collision possible there since no freeway at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, when reaching y=9, it's safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, the player needs to move up through y=1 to y=8, but has to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 9, since each up move increases y by 1, and starting from 0, to reach 9, need at least 9 up moves. But the player can also stay or move down, which might be necessary to wait for cars to pass, so H might be more than 9.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should aim for as few turns as possible, so probably minimize waiting.\n\nFirst, I need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway, meaning when no car on that freeway has x=0 in its span.\n\nSince collision is checked only at the turn when the player is on that y, and for that specific turn.\n\nAlso, when moving from y to y+1, at turn T, if you move to y+1, you are on y+1 only at turn T+1, I think? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at time t+1 is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if for y_T (the y-position at turn T), and if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nAnd when you take an action at turn T, moving to a different y, at turn T you are still on the old y, and at turn T+1 you are on the new y.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked based on cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen you take action at T, you set y_{T+1}, so at T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision is checked there.\n\nIf you move at turn T, from y to y', then at turn T, you are on y, and at turn T+1, you are on y'.\n\nSo, for example, to go from y=0 to y=1, at some turn T, you take action U, so y_{T+1} = 1. Then at turn T, you are at y=0, which is safe. At turn T+1, you are at y=1, and you need to ensure that at turn T+1, no car on freeway 1 has 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nThe player can also stay or move down to avoid being on a freeway when it's dangerous.\n\nBut moving down from y=0 is not possible, since y=0 is the bottom, and y must be in [0,9], so at y=0, D would keep it at 0 or something? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so at y=0, if you do D, Δy = -1, but y_{t+1} = -1, which is invalid, so probably it stays at 0 or something. The game dynamics don't specify bounds, but it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so I think if action would take it out, it should be clamped or invalid, but it's not specified.\n\nLooking back: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so if action would make it <0 or >9, it should be set to 0 or 9, or perhaps the action is invalid, but I think for simplicity, we can assume that if y_t = 0 and action D, then y_{t+1} = 0, similarly for y=9 and U.\n\nSimilarly, S keeps it the same.\n\nI think that's reasonable.\n\nSo, at y=0, D is equivalent to S, I suppose.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U is like S.\n\nNow, back to the task.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at turn t_1=56.\n\nWe need to find actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, such that after H turns, y =9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so at time t_1, action a_{t_1} determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nGenerally, at time t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo, at turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, setting y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we take a_{t_1 +1}, setting y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to action at t_1 + H -1, setting y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe position is reached at turn t_1 + H, after H actions.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, since we need to increase y by 9.\n\nBut due to cars, we might need to wait.\n\nNow, to find for each freeway, when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, let's define the car spans at turn T, for T >= t_1 =56.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, the span at turn T is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)] for each car, where τ is tail, h is head, s speed.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [tail, head], and both increase by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow, for a given freeway, we need that at turn T, for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in [tail + s*(T - t_1), head + s*(T - t_1)].\n\nThat is, 0 < tail + s*(T - t_1) or 0 > head + s*(T - t_1), but since tail < head, the span is [lower, upper] with lower = tail + s*(T - t_1), upper = head + s*(T - t_1).\n\nFor right-moving, lower = τ + s*(T - t_1), upper = h + s*(T - t_1).\n\n0 not in [lower, upper] means either upper < 0 or lower > 0.\n\nSimilarly for each car on the freeway.\n\nNow, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, τ = -83, h = -48, s=36, right.\n\nAt turn T, lower = -83 + 36*(T - 56)\n\nUpper = -48 + 36*(T - 56)\n\n0 not in [lower, upper] if upper < 0 or lower > 0.\n\nUpper < 0: -48 + 36*(T-56) < 0 => 36*(T-56) < 48 => T-56 < 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-56 <=1 since T integer, T <= 57.\n\nT-56 < 48/36 = 4/3, so for T-56 <=1, upper <0? Let's compute.\n\n-48 + 36*(T-56) <0 => 36*(T-56) < 48 => T-56 < 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so for T-56 <=1, i.e., T <=57, upper <0.\n\nT-56 integer, so T-56 <=1, T<=57.\n\nLower >0: -83 + 36*(T-56) >0 => 36*(T-56) >83 => T-56 > 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-56 >=3, T>=59.\n\nThus, unsafe when upper >=0 and lower <=0, which is when not (upper<0 or lower>0), so unsafe when lower <=0 and upper >=0.\n\nLower <=0: -83 +36*(T-56) <=0 => 36*(T-56) <=83 => T-56 <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so T-56 <=2, T<=58\n\nUpper >=0: -48 +36*(T-56) >=0 => 36*(T-56) >=48 => T-56 >=48/36=4/3≈1.333, so T-56 >=2 since integer, T>=58\n\nSo lower <=0 when T-56 <=2, T<=58\n\nUpper >=0 when T-56 >=2, T>=58\n\nThus, unsafe when T=58, because at T=58, lower <=0 and upper >=0.\n\nAt T=58: lower = -83 +36*(2) = -83 +72 = -11 <=0\n\nUpper = -48 +72 = 24 >=0, so 0 in [-11,24], yes unsafe.\n\nAt T=57: lower = -83 +36*(1) = -83+36= -47 <0, upper= -48+36= -12 <0, both negative, so upper<0, safe.\n\nAt T=59: lower= -83 +36*3= -83+108=25>0, upper= -48+108=60>0, lower>0, safe.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=58.\n\nT=58 is unsafe, T=57 and T=59 safe.\n\nT-56=0, T=56: lower= -83 +0 = -83, upper=-48, both neg, safe.\n\nT=57: as above, safe.\n\nT=58: unsafe.\n\nT=59: safe.\n\nSo only turn 58 is unsafe for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, car (-48, -83, right, 36), but head and tail: in table it says \"(-48, -83, right, 36)\", so same as freeway 1, so unsafe only at T=58.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, unsafe only at T=58.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48, -71, right, 24)? Tail and head: it says (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nIn the table: for freeway 4, \"(-48, -71, right, 24)\"\n\nSo τ = -71? Head -48, tail -71? But direction right, so head should be larger, -48 > -71, yes.\n\nτ = tail = -71, h = head = -48, s=24.\n\nAt turn T, lower = τ + s*(T-56) = -71 + 24*(T-56)\n\nUpper = h + s*(T-56) = -48 + 24*(T-56)\n\n0 not in [lower, upper] if upper <0 or lower >0.\n\nUpper <0: -48 +24*(T-56) <0 => 24*(T-56) <48 => T-56 < 2, so T<=57\n\nLower >0: -71 +24*(T-56) >0 => 24*(T-56) >71 => T-56 > 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so T-56 >=3, T>=59\n\nUnsafe when lower <=0 and upper >=0.\n\nLower <=0: -71 +24*(T-56) <=0 => 24*(T-56) <=71 => T-56 <= 71/24 ≈2.958, so T-56 <=2, T<=58\n\nUpper >=0: -48 +24*(T-56) >=0 => 24*(T-56) >=48 => T-56 >=2, T>=58\n\nThus unsafe only when T=58.\n\nAt T=58: lower= -71 +24*2 = -71+48= -23 <=0, upper= -48+48=0 >=0, so 0 in [-23,0], yes unsafe.\n\nAt T=57: lower= -71 +24*1= -47 <0, upper= -48+24= -24 <0, safe.\n\nT=59: lower= -71 +24*3= -71+72=1>0, upper= -48+72=24>0, safe.\n\nSo again, only T=58 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as freeway 4? Table says for 5: (-48, -71, right, 24), same as 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, s=4, right.\n\nSo at T, lower = 37 + 4*(T-56)\n\nUpper = 48 + 4*(T-56)\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, s=4, so lower=1 +4*(T-56), upper=12+4*(T-56)\n\nThird car: head=-24? tail=-35? head=-24, tail=-35, since -24 > -35, so lower=-35 +4*(T-56), upper=-24 +4*(T-56)\n\nNow, for freeway 7 to be safe at T, 0 must not be in any car's span.\n\nSo we need for each car, 0 not in its [lower, upper].\n\nFirst car: lower = 37 +4(T-56), upper=48+4(T-56)\n\nSince lower and upper both positive and increasing, lower >0 for all T, so 0 not in span, always safe for this car. Because min lower at T=56 is 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, upper min 48>0, so always safe.\n\nSecond car: lower=1 +4(T-56), upper=12+4(T-56)\n\nAt T=56, lower=1, upper=12, both positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAs T increases, it moves right, always positive, so always safe.\n\nThird car: lower= -35 +4(T-56), upper= -24 +4(T-56)\n\n0 not in [lower, upper] if upper<0 or lower>0.\n\nUpper<0: -24 +4(T-56) <0 => 4(T-56) <24 => T-56 <6, T<=61\n\nLower>0: -35 +4(T-56) >0 => 4(T-56) >35 => T-56 >35/4=8.75, so T-56>=9, T>=65\n\nUnsafe when lower <=0 and upper >=0.\n\nLower <=0: -35 +4(T-56) <=0 => 4(T-56) <=35 => T-56 <=35/4=8.75, so T-56<=8, T<=64\n\nUpper >=0: -24 +4(T-56) >=0 => 4(T-56) >=24 => T-56 >=6, T>=62\n\nNow, unsafe when T-56 <=8 and T-56 >=6, so T-56 from 6 to 8 inclusive, i.e., T=62,63,64.\n\nBecause at T=62: T-56=6, lower= -35 +4*6= -35+24= -11 <=0, upper= -24+24=0 >=0, 0 in span.\n\nT=63: lower= -35+28= -7 <=0, upper= -24+28=4 >=0, unsafe.\n\nT=64: lower= -35+32= -3 <=0, upper= -24+32=8 >=0, unsafe.\n\nT=61: T-56=5, lower= -35+20= -15<0, upper= -24+20= -4<0, safe.\n\nT=65: lower= -35+36=1>0, upper= -24+36=12>0, safe.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe at T=62,63,64 due to the third car.\n\nFirst two cars always safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same cars, same as freeway 7, so unsafe at T=62,63,64.\n\nNow, summarize the unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=58\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=58\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=58\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=58\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=58\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=58\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=62,63,64\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=62,63,64\n\ny=1 to 6 all unsafe only at T=58.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at T=62,63,64.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through each y from 1 to 8 exactly once, but not necessarily in sequence, because the player can move up and down.\n\nTo minimize turns, probably best to go directly up, but might need to avoid being on certain y at certain turns.\n\nThe player starts at turn t_1=56, at y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T, with actions in between.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so to go from 0 to 9, need at least 9 up moves.\n\nBut we can have stays or down moves, which increase the number of turns.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut we need to check when we can be on each y.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, we can wait at safe positions.\n\nSafe positions are y=0, y=9, and for y=1-8 when not unsafe.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's find a path with minimal H.\n\nFirst, suppose we want to go straight up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at turn 56, y=0.\n\nAt turn 56, take action: to go up, take U, so y_{57} =1.\n\nBut at turn 57, we are at y=1, and we need to check if y=1 is safe at T=57.\n\nFrom above, y=1 is safe at T=57, since only unsafe at T=58.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 57, we can take U to go to y=2 at turn 58.\n\nBut at turn 58, we would be at y=2, and y=2 is unsafe at T=58.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at turn 57 we are at y=1, and we take U, then at turn 58, y=2.\n\nBut T=58, y=2 is unsafe, since y=2 unsafe at T=58.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=2 at turn 58.\n\nWe could stay or move down, but at y=1, moving down to y=0, but y=0 is safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at T=57, but if we stay at y=1 at turn 57, meaning we take S at turn 57? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 56: position y=0, take action a_{56}.\n\nIf a_{56} = U, then y_{57} =1.\n\nAt turn 57, we are at y=57? Position at turn 57 is (0, y_{57}).\n\ny_{57} is set by action at 56.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt turn 56: y=0, take action.\n\nIf we take U, y_{57} =1.\n\nThen at turn 57, we are at y=1.\n\nNow, at turn 57, y=1 is safe, as per above.\n\nThen at turn 57, we take action for y_{58}.\n\nIf we take U, y_{58}=2, but at turn 58, y=2 is unsafe.\n\nIf we take S, y_{58}=1, then at turn 58, we are at y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is unsafe at T=58? From above, y=1 unsafe at T=58.\n\nYes, all y=1 to 6 unsafe at T=58.\n\nSo if at turn 58, we are at y=1, it would be unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we take D at turn 57, y_{58}=0, then at turn 58, y=0, safe.\n\nBut that delays progress.\n\nSince y=0 is safe at all times, we can stay at y=0 or go to y=0.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nThe unsafe turn for y=1-6 is only T=58.\n\nSo we should avoid being on y=1 to 6 at turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 and 8, avoid at T=62,63,64.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at turn 56, y=0.\n\nWe can take action at turn 56.\n\nOption: take U at 56, go to y=1 at turn 57.\n\nAt turn 57, y=1 is safe.\n\nBut if we go to y=2 at turn 58, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo at turn 57, instead of going up, we can stay or go down.\n\nIf we take S at turn 57, y_{58}=1, but at turn 58, y=1 unsafe.\n\nIf we take D at turn 57, y_{58}=0, then at turn 58, y=0, safe.\n\nBut then we have wasted a turn, and are back to y=0.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nSince the only problem is turn 58, we can be at y=0 or y=9 or y=7 or y=8 at turn 58, but y=7 and 8 might be safe at T=58.\n\ny=7: from above, unsafe at T=62,63,64, so at T=58, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at T=58.\n\nBut we are at low y, can't reach high y quickly.\n\nAt turn 57, we are at y=1 (if we went up at 56).\n\nInstead of moving to y=2 at 58, we can, for example, move to a safe y.\n\nBut the only safe y at turn 58 are y=0,7,8,9 but y=9 not reached yet.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at T=58.\n\nBut from y=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2 at next turn.\n\nAt turn 57, from y=1, actions: U to y=2, D to y=0, S to y=1.\n\nNone of which are safe for turn 58 except if we go to y=0, but y=0 is safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at turn 58.\n\nNot progress.\n\nPerhaps we should not go up immediately.\n\nAt turn 56, instead of taking U, we take S or D, but at y=0, D might be same as S, so take S at 56, stay at y=0 for turn 57.\n\nAt turn 56, take S, then y_{57} = y_56 +0 =0, so at turn 57, still at y=0.\n\nThen at turn 57, take U, go to y=1 at turn 58.\n\nBut at turn 58, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nTake S at 56 and 57, but at turn 58, if at y=0, safe, but not moving.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1-6 at turn 58, we need to be either below or above at that turn.\n\nBut since we start at y=0, we can only be at low y.\n\nPerhaps we can go up after turn 58.\n\nTurn 58 is the only unsafe turn for low freeways.\n\nSo, one way: stay at y=0 until after turn 58.\n\nFor example, at turn 56, take S: y_{57} =0\n\nTurn 57: position y=0, take S: y_{58}=0\n\nThen at turn 58, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 58, we can start moving up.\n\nTake U at turn 58: y_{59} =1\n\nAt turn 59, y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 is safe at T=59, since only unsafe at 58.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 59, take U: y_{60}=2\n\nAt turn 60, y=2, safe, since unsafe only at 58.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=8 quickly.\n\nBut we have y=7 and 8 unsafe at T=62,63,64.\n\nNow, let's see the turns.\n\nStart:\n\nTurn 56: take S, so y_{57} =0 (stay)\n\nTurn 57: at y=0, take S, y_{58}=0\n\nTurn 58: at y=0, take U, y_{59}=1\n\nTurn 59: at y=1, take U, y_{60}=2\n\nTurn 60: at y=2, take U, y_{61}=3\n\nTurn 61: at y=3, take U, y_{62}=4\n\nAt turn 62, y=4? y_{62}=4, so at turn 62, position y=4.\n\nBut we need to go to y=7 or 8, but at turn 62, y=7 and 8 are unsafe? y=7 unsafe at T=62,63,64.\n\nBut at turn 62, we are at y=4, which is safe, since y=4 only unsafe at 58, past.\n\nThen at turn 62, take U: y_{63}=5\n\nTurn 63: at y=5, take U, y_{64}=6\n\nTurn 64: at y=6, take U, y_{65}=7\n\nAt turn 65, y=7.\n\nNow, y=7 at T=65.\n\nIs it safe? From above, y=7 unsafe at T=62,63,64, so at T=65, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 65: at y=7, take U, y_{66}=8\n\nTurn 66: at y=8, take U, y_{67}=9\n\nTurn 67: at y=9, done.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn 67, with actions from t=56 to t=66? Let's list actions and positions.\n\nTurn | action at turn | position at turn (y_t) | note\n\nt=56: action a_56, sets y_57\n\nPosition at t=56: y_56=0 (given)\n\nAfter action a_56, y_57 is set.\n\nThen position at t=57 is y_57.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSequence:\n\n- At t=56: take S, so y_57 = 0\n\n- Position at t=57: y=0\n\n- At t=57: take S, so y_58 =0\n\n- Position at t=58: y=0 (safe)\n\n- At t=58: take U, so y_59 =1\n\n- Position at t=59: y=1 (safe, since T=59 not 58)\n\n- At t=59: take U, y_60=2\n\n- Position t=60: y=2 (safe)\n\n- At t=60: take U, y_61=3\n\n- t=61: y=3\n\n- At t=61: take U, y_62=4\n\n- t=62: y=4 (safe, y=4 unsafe only at 58)\n\n- At t=62: take U, y_63=5\n\n- t=63: y=5 (safe)\n\n- At t=63: take U, y_64=6\n\n- t=64: y=6 (safe)\n\n- At t=64: take U, y_65=7\n\n- t=65: y=7\n\nNow, y=7 at T=65. y=7 unsafe at 62,63,64, so T=65 is safe.\n\n- At t=65: take U, y_66=8\n\n- t=66: y=8\n\ny=8 at T=66. y=8 unsafe at 62,63,64, so T=66 safe.\n\n- At t=66: take U, y_67=9\n\n- t=67: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, actions from t=56 to t=66, that's 11 actions: t=56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66.\n\nNumber of turns: actions at t=56 to t=66 inclusive? t=56 to t=66 is 11 actions.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nHere, actions at t=56 to t=66, so 11 actions, y_67=9.\n\nt1=56, so actions a_{56} to a_{66}, that's t from 0 to 10? Let t' = t - t1, so t' from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt t'=0, action a_{t1 +0} = a_56\n\n...\n\na_{t1 + H-1} = a_{56 + H-1}\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} = y_{56 + H}\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn this case, after actions a_56 to a_66, y_67=9, so t1 + H =67, t1=56, so 56 + H =67, H=11.\n\nBut we can do better? H=11, but min is 9, so perhaps we can avoid waiting.\n\nIn this path, we waited at y=0 for turns 57 and 58, but we could go up faster if we skip the unsafe turn.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at turn 57, but then at turn 58, instead of being on y=1-6, we need to be elsewhere, but we can only be at y=0,1,2 from previous.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are safe at turn 58, we could be there, but we start at y=0, it takes many turns to reach high y.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at turn 58, we need to increase y by 7 in 2 turns?

Positions:\n\nAfter t=58: y_59=1 (at t=59)\n\nt=59: action U, y_60=2\n\nt=60: position y=2, action U, y_61=3\n\nt=61: position y=3, action U, y_62=4\n\nt=62: position y=4\n\nTo reach higher y faster, we need more up moves, but we are moving one per turn.\n\nAt t=62, we are at y=4.\n\nIf we continue U each turn, we go to y=5 at t=63, y=6 at t=64, y=7 at t=65.\n\nBut at t=62,63,64, we are at y=4,5,6, safe.\n\nBut we can, for example, at some point move faster, but no, each move changes y by 1.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=7 at an earlier turn.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn T, we need to have started from y=0 at least 7 turns earlier.\n\nEarliest: at t=58, y=0, then t=59 y=1, t=60 y=2, t=61 y=3, t=62 y=4, t=63 y=5, t=64 y=6, t=65 y=7. So y=7 at t=65.\n\nIf we could be at higher y at t=58, but we can't.\n\nSo y=7 at t=65 is earliest possible from this start.\n\nThen y=8 at t=66, y=9 at t=67.\n\nNow, but we have the unsafe turns for y=7 and 8 at t=62,63,64, but we are not on them during that time, so fine.\n\nIn this path, we used 11 actions: from t=56 to t=66 for actions, y_67=9.\n\nt1=56, actions a_56 to a_66, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut we can reduce H by not waiting at the beginning.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=1 at t=57, but then at t=57, we need to go to a safe position for t=58.\n\nBut safe positions for t=58 are y=0,7,8.\n\ny=7 and 8 unreachable.\n\nSo only y=0.\n\nSo we must go down to y=0 at t=58.\n\nThus, we have to have the down move, which costs an extra action.\n\nSimilarly, if we start by staying, we have extra S actions.\n\nSo no saving.\n\nPerhaps for the high freeways, we can time it so that we pass through y=7 and 8 when safe.\n\nBut in the current path, we do.\n\nBut we might be able to reach y=9 faster by avoiding the delay at the high end.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 before t=62.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=58, earliest y=7 at t=65, as above.\n\nt=58: y=0\n\nAfter 7 up moves: at t=65, y=7.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=65, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen we need two more up moves to y=9 at t=67.\n\nBut is there a way to have fewer total turns?\n\nTotal actions: from t=56 to t=66, 11 actions.\n\nBut min possible is 9, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 unsafe only at t=62,63,64, we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 at t=61 or earlier, or at t=65 or later.\n\nBut from start, with the constraint at t=58.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible before t=58.\n\nAt t=56: take U, y_57=1\n\nt=57: at y=1, but at t=57, if we take U, we go to y=2 at t=58, unsafe.\n\nIf we take S, stay at y=1, unsafe at t=58.\n\nIf take D, go to y=0 at t=58, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at t=58.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=57, we are at y=1, and we can only choose action for next position.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at t=58.\n\nThus, the path I have is efficient: wait at y=0 for t=57 and t=58, then go straight up to y=9.\n\nIn terms of actions: we have two S at beginning, then 9 U moves.\n\nIn the sequence: actions: t=56: S (to stay at 0 for t=57)\n\nt=57: S (stay at 0 for t=58)\n\nt=58: U (to y=1 at t=59)\n\nt=59: U (y=2 at t=60)\n\n...\n\nup to t=65: U (y=7 at t=66? Let's list:\n\nActions:\n\nt=56: S → y_57 =0\n\nt=57: S → y_58 =0\n\nt=58: U → y_59 =1\n\nt=59: U → y_60 =2\n\nt=60: U → y_61 =3\n\nt=61: U → y_62 =4\n\nt=62: U → y_63 =5\n\nt=63: U → y_64 =6\n\nt=64: U → y_65 =7\n\nt=65: U → y_66 =8\n\nt=66: U → y_67 =9\n\nSo actions from t=56 to t=66, 11 actions.\n\ny_67=9.\n\nBut at t=66, action U sets y_67=9, and position at t=67 is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, action at t=66 sets y_67=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at an earlier turn, we need fewer actions.\n\nFor example, if we could reach y=9 at t=65, that would be better, but from above, at t=65, we are at y=7 if we go straight, but we have the waiting.\n\nWithout waiting, if no cars, we could go: t=56: U → y_57=1\n\nt=57: U → y_58=2\n\n...\n\nt=64: U → y_65=9? Start from t=56 y=0, after k up moves, at t=56+k, y=k.\n\nSo to y=9 at t=65: need 9 up moves from t=56 to t=64.\n\nt=56: U → y_57=1\n\nt=57: U → y_58=2\n\n...\n\nt=64: U → y_65=9\n\nBut at t=58, y=2, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nWith the cars, we must avoid t=58 for y=1-6.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut perhaps we can save at the high end.\n\nFor example, in the path, at t=62, we are at y=4, but if we could be at higher y.\n\nBut we can't, because we started late.\n\nAnother idea: after being at y=0 at t=58, we go up, but at some point, when we approach y=7, we can time it to be after t=64.\n\nBut we are doing that.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some safe y to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at low y, after t=58, all safe.\n\nAt high y, before t=62, if we can be there.\n\nBut to be at y=7 before t=62, we need to be at y=7 at t=61 or earlier.\n\nBut at t=58, we are at y=0, so at t=59 y=1, t=60 y=2, t=61 y=3, cannot reach y=7.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, the path I have is minimal.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions: for t from 56 to 66: S, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nFirst two S, then nine U.\n\nNow, for the answer format, we need to list the actions starting from turn t_1=56.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we handled them.\n\nNow, but in the high end, we have y=7 at t=65, which is safe, etc.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at any point we are on unsafe position.\n\nAt t=58: y=0, safe.\n\nt=59: y=1, safe (only unsafe at 58)\n\nt=60: y=2, safe\n\n...\n\nt=64: y=6, safe (y=6 unsafe only at 58)\n\nt=65: y=7, safe (unsafe at 62-64, but t=65>64)\n\nt=66: y=8, safe (similarly)\n\nt=67: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by moving down or something, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nFor example, if we go down, it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nSo H=11 should be minimal.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, so 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can do H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10, then y_{56+10}=y_{66}=9.\n\nSo actions from t=56 to t=65? Actions a_56 to a_65, 10 actions, y_{66}=9.\n\nNow, y_{66} set by action at t=65.\n\nTo have y_{66}=9, we need to be at y=8 or 9 at t=65.\n\nPosition at t=65 must be such that after action, y_{66}=9.\n\nIf at t=65, y=8, then take U to y=9.\n\nOr if y=9, take S or something.\n\nBut need to reach y=9 at t=66.\n\nNow, with cars.\n\ny_{66}=9, so at t=66, position y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to get there.\n\nNow, to have y_{66}=9, and minimal actions.\n\nBut we have the constraint at t=58.\n\nIf we start, and we must not be on y=1-6 at t=58.\n\nt=58 is turn 58.\n\nNow, with 10 actions, we have to cover the moves.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up immediately but avoid t=58.\n\nAt t=56: U → y_57=1\n\nThen at t=57: since at y=1, and t=57 safe, but if we take U, y_58=2 unsafe.\n\nSo we must take D or S at t=57.\n\nIf take D, y_58=0\n\nThen we are at y=0 at t=58.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9 in the remaining actions.\n\nActions: a_56 to a_65, 10 actions.\n\na_56: U → y_57=1\n\na_57: D → y_58=0\n\nNow, we have used two actions, back to y=0 at t=58.\n\nThen we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 8 actions? a_58 to a_65, 8 actions.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions, impossible with 8 actions.\n\nAfter a_57, y_58=0.\n\nThen actions a_58 to a_65: 8 actions, setting y_59 to y_66.\n\ny_66 must be 9.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so from y_58=0, after 8 actions, max y is 8, cannot reach 9.\n\ny_58=0, then y_59 = y_58 + Δy_58, etc., up to y_66.\n\ny_66 = y_58 + sum_{k=58}^{65} Δy_k\n\nEach |Δy| <=1, so |y_66 - y_58| <= 8.\n\ny_58=0, y_66=9, difference 9, impossible in 8 steps.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 at t=66 with only 10 actions starting from t=56.\n\nSimilarly, if we take other actions.\n\nSuppose at t=56, S: y_57=0\n\nt=57: U: y_58=1, but at t=58, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=56: S, y_57=0\n\nt=57: S, y_58=0\n\nThen we have a_56 and a_57 used, y_58=0.\n\nThen a_58 to a_65: 8 actions, to go from y_58=0 to y_66=9, impossible, max y=8.\n\ny_66 = y_58 + sum_{k=58}^{65} Δy_k, 8 terms, max increase 8, to y=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9.\n\nThus, H=10 impossible.\n\nH=11 is possible as above.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the actions: as listed.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at start, then nine U.\n\nBut let's write the actions for each turn.\n\nTurn t_1 =56: action S\n\nTurn t_1 +1 =57: action S\n\nTurn t_1 +2 =58: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +3 =59: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +4 =60: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +5 =61: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +6 =62: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +7 =63: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +8 =64: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +9 =65: action U\n\nTurn t_1 +10=66: action U\n\nAfter action at t=66, y_67=9.\n\nt from 0 to 10, H=11 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, list from turn 56 to turn 66.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, we have unsafe at t=62,63,64, but in the path, at those times, we are at y=4,5,6, not on y=7 or 8, so fine.\n\nAt t=62: y=4\n\nt=63: y=5\n\nt=64: y=6\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen t=65: y=7, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo this should be correct.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence where we reach earlier, but not possible.\n\nSo, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 56\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when a car covers \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Summary of Unsafe Turns:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 58\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 62, 63, 64\\).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 57 and 58 to avoid the unsafe condition on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 58.\n- From turn 59 onwards, move up (\\(U\\)) continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible.\n- At turns 62, 63, and 64, the player is at \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) respectively, which are safe since these freeways are only unsafe at turn 58.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 65 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 66, both safe as these turns are after the unsafe period (62-64) for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are taken from turn \\(t_1 = 56\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 56 + 10 = 66\\), resulting in \\(y_{67} = 9\\).\n\n| Turn          | Action | Position at Turn (after action) | Notes |\n|---------------|--------|---------------------------------|-------|\n| \\(t_1 = 56\\) | S      | \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 57           | Stay to avoid moving into unsafe freeway at turn 58. |\n| \\(t_1 + 1 = 57\\) | S | \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 58 | Stay to remain safe at turn 58. |\n| \\(t_1 + 2 = 58\\) | U | \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 59 | Move up to \\(y = 1\\); safe as \\(T = 59 \\neq 58\\). |\n| \\(t_1 + 3 = 59\\) | U | \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 60 | Move up to \\(y = 2\\); safe. |\n| \\(t_1 + 4 = 60\\) | U | \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 61 | Move up to \\(y = 3\\); safe. |\n| \\(t_1 + 5 = 61\\) | U | \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 62 | Move up to \\(y = 4\\); safe as \\(y = 4\\) unsafe only at \\(T = 58\\). |\n| \\(t_1 + 6 = 62\\) | U | \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 63 | Move up to \\(y = 5\\); safe. |\n| \\(t_1 + 7 = 63\\) | U | \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 64 | Move up to \\(y = 6\\); safe. |\n| \\(t_1 + 8 = 64\\) | U | \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 65 | Move up to \\(y = 7\\); safe as \\(T = 65 > 64\\). |\n| \\(t_1 + 9 = 65\\) | U | \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 66 | Move up to \\(y = 8\\); safe as \\(T = 66 > 64\\). |\n| \\(t_1 + 10 = 66\\) | U | \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 67 | Move up to \\(y = 9\\); goal reached. |\n\n### Verification:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - At turn 58, player is at \\(y = 0\\), safe (no freeway).\n  - At turns 59-61, player is at \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\), all safe as unsafe only at turn 58.\n  - At turns 62-64, player is at \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\), safe as unsafe only at turn 58.\n  - At turns 65-66, player is at \\(y = 7, 8\\), safe as unsafe only at turns 62-64.\n- **Efficiency**: \\(H = 11\\) is minimal.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 58 to (0,9) as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I'm not in the span of any car on that row at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The cars are on specific freeways, and they move left or right with a constant speed. The position is given at turn t_1 = 58, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nThe player position update is straightforward: U for up (y increases), D for down (y decreases), S for stay (y same). y is between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9. Since I'm starting at y=0 and need to get to y=9, I need to move up, but I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, the car spans are given for turn 58. For each car, I have the head and tail at t=58, direction, and speed. The direction tells me if it's left-moving or right-moving. From the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: span at time T is [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span at time T is [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeways 1 to 6, it's a single car each, and for 7 and 8, there are three cars each.\n\nLet me list all the cars clearly.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36. Since it's right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] = [-83 + 36*(T-58), -48 + 36*(T-58)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) so span at T: [-71 + 24*(T-58), -48 + 24*(T-58)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4\n\nFreeway 6: same as 4\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFor each, span at T:\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=4, so [τ + s(T-58), h + s(T-58)] = [37 + 4(T-58), 48 + 4(T-58)]\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=4, [1 + 4(T-58), 12 + 4(T-58)]\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=4, [-35 + 4(T-58), -24 + 4(T-58)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as freeway 7: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if for the freeway y that I'm on at turn T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: if I move from y to y' at turn T, I'm considered to be on y at turn T, and on y' at turn T+1. So at the turn when I move, I'm still on the starting row, and only on the new row from the next turn.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=0 at turn 58, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least 9, since I need to go from 0 to 9, each step can increase y by at most 1, so minimum 9 turns if I go up every turn. But I might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more.\n\nBut let's see if I can go straight up in 9 turns.\n\nI need to check for each freeway row, at the turn when I'm on that row, whether there is a car covering position 0 at that time.\n\nSince I move one row per turn if I go up, but I might stay or go down, but to minimize time, I probably want to go up as much as possible.\n\nAssume I go up every turn from turn 58 to turn 66, that would be 9 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, and at turn 67 I would be at y=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=58: y=0\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after turn t action, at turn t+1 I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 58: action a_58, then at turn 59, y_59 = y_58 + Δy_58\n\nSimilarly, turn 59: action a_59, at turn 60, y_60 = y_59 + Δy_59, and so on.\n\nI start at turn 58 at (0,0).\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 58 + H, I am at y_{58+H}.\n\nI need y_{58+H} = 9.\n\nAnd during the sequence, for each t from 58 to 58+H-1, when I am at position (0, y_t) at turn t, I need that for freeway k = y_t, 0 is not in the span of any car on k at time t.\n\nSince at turn t, I am on freeway y_t.\n\nNow, for the final turn, when I reach y=9, at that turn, I am on y=9, which has no cars, so it's safe. Similarly, start at y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, back to the plan: if I go up every turn starting from turn 58:\n\nAction at turn 58: U, so at turn 59, y=1\n\nThen turn 59: U, at turn 60, y=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 65: U, at turn 66, y=7? Let's list:\n\nTurn | action | y at turn start | after action, y at next turn\nt=58: y=0, action a_58, then at t=59, y=1 if U\n\nBetter to think of the state at the beginning of each turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nFor collision: at each turn t, when I am at (0, y_t), if y_t is between 1 and 8, I need to check that for freeway y_t, at time t, 0 is not in any car span on that row.\n\nTime t is the current turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 58, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action, say U, then at turn 59, I am at y=1, and I need to check for freeway 1 at time t=59.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nSo for going straight up:\n\nI will be on y=1 at turn 59, y=2 at turn 60, ..., y=8 at turn 66, y=9 at turn 67.\n\nt=58: y=0, safe\n\naction U → at t=59, y=1\n\nAt t=59: on freeway 1, need to check if 0 in car span at t=59\n\nThen action U → at t=60, y=2, and so on, up to at t=66: on y=8, then action U → at t=67, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=9 at turn 67, so H=9 actions? From t=58 to t=66, that's 9 actions, at t=67 I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: actions from t=58 to t=58+H-1, and at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nt_1 = 58, after H actions, at turn 58 + H, y=9.\n\nActions at turns t=58 to t=58+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have moved H times, so y increased by the net up moves.\n\nBut in this case, with 9 up moves, from t=58 to t=66 (9 actions), at t=67, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I need to check for each row at the time I am on it.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: at time t, car span for the car: since only one car, and it's right-moving, span at T: [-83 + 36*(T-58), -48 + 36*(T-58)]\n\nI am on freeway 1 at turn T=59.\n\nSo at T=59, span: [-83 + 36*(1), -48 + 36*1] = [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12]\n\n0 is not in [-47,-12], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: I am on it at turn T=60 for going up.\n\nFreeway 2 has the same car as freeway 1? No, each freeway has its own cars.\n\nFreeway 2: also one car, (-48,-83,right,36), same as freeway 1.\n\nAt T=60, span: [-83 + 36*(60-58), -48 + 36*2] = [-83 + 72, -48 + 72] = [-11, 24]\n\n-11 to 24, 0 is in this interval? -11 <= 0 <= 24, yes, 0 is between -11 and 24.\n\nSo at turn 60, on freeway 2, 0 is in the car span, so collision would occur.\n\nTherefore, if I go straight up, at turn 60 on y=2, collision with car on freeway 2.\n\nSo I cannot go straight up; I need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other rows.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, at which times 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time T, if there is a car on k such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThen, when I am on row k at time T, it is unsafe.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nSince I need to pass through each row from 1 to 8, but not necessarily at consecutive times, I can wait or go down.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should only wait when necessary.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 + 36*(T-58), -48 + 36*(T-58) ]\n\nSet low = -83 + 36*(T-58), high = -48 + 36*(T-58)\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -83 + 36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36ΔT, where ΔT = T-58\n\nSo from first inequality: 36ΔT <= 83, ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <= 2 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36ΔT, so 36ΔT >= 48, ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT >= 2\n\nΔT >= 2 and ΔT <= 2, so only at ΔT=2, i.e., T=60\n\nAt T=60, low = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11, high = -48 + 72 = 24, -11 <=0<=24, yes.\n\nAt other times, not covered.\n\nFor example, ΔT=1: low=-47, high=-12, both negative, 0 not in\n\nΔT=2: -11 to 24, 0 in\n\nΔT=3: -83+108=25, -48+108=60, both positive, 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe only at T=60.\n\nBut freeway 1 is row 1, I am on it at some turn.\n\nIn the straight up plan, I was on row 1 at T=59, which is safe, row 2 at T=60, unsafe.\n\nBut row 1 itself is safe except at T=60? T=60 is when row 2 is unsafe, but row 1 at other times.\n\nFor row 1, unsafe only at T=60? Let me confirm.\n\nAt T=60, for row 1, is there a car covering 0?\n\nFreeway 1 car at T=60: as above, span [-11,24], includes 0, yes.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, (-48,-83,right,36), so same as freeway 1, unsafe only at T=60.\n\nFreeway 2 has the same car specification, so for freeway 2, also unsafe only at T=60.\n\nBut freeway 2 is different row, but the car is on freeway 2, so for freeway 2, at T=60, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, unsafe only at T=60.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nSpan at T: [ -71 + 24*(T-58), -48 + 24*(T-58) ]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 24ΔT\n\nFirst: 24ΔT <= 71, ΔT <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so ΔT <= 2\n\nSecond: 24ΔT >= 48, ΔT >= 2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only at ΔT=2, T=60\n\nAt T=60, low = -71 + 48 = -23? ΔT=2, T-58=2\n\n-71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23\n\nhigh = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-23, 0], which includes 0, since 0 <=0.\n\n-23 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 and 6 same, unsafe at T=60 only.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span at T: [37 + 4*(T-58), 48 + 4*(T-58)]\n\n0 in span? low =37 +4ΔT, since ΔT >=0, low >=37>0, so always positive, 0 not in, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span [1 +4ΔT, 12 +4ΔT]\n\nlow =1 +4ΔT >=1>0, so always positive, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), span [-35 +4ΔT, -24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4ΔT <=0 and 0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: 4ΔT <=35, ΔT <=35/4=8.75, ΔT <=8\n\nSecond: 4ΔT >=24, ΔT >=6\n\nSo ΔT from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nFor ΔT=6: low = -35 +24 = -11, high = -24 +24=0, -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nΔT=7: low=-35+28=-7, high=-24+28=4, -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nΔT=8: low=-35+32=-3, high=-24+32=8, -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nΔT=9: low=-35+36=1>0, high=12, 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe when ΔT=6,7,8 i.e. T=64,65,66\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so unsafe at T=64,65,66.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: unsafe at T=60 only\n\n- Row 2: unsafe at T=60 only\n\n- Row 3: unsafe at T=60 only\n\n- Row 4: unsafe at T=60 only\n\n- Row 5: unsafe at T=60 only\n\n- Row 6: unsafe at T=60 only\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at T=64,65,66\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at T=64,65,66\n\nAll rows 1-6 are unsafe only at T=60, and rows 7-8 unsafe at T=64-66.\n\nNow, I need to be on each row from 1 to 8 at some turn, but not when it is unsafe for that row.\n\nSpecifically, for row k, I need to be on it at a time when it is safe.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at T=58, and need to reach y=9, I must pass through each y=1 to 8 at some point.\n\nThe minimal time path would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nFor rows 1-6, they are only unsafe at T=60, so as long as I am not on them at T=60, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly for 7-8, avoid T=64,65,66.\n\nIn the straight up plan, I am on row 1 at T=59 (safe), row 2 at T=60 (unsafe), row 3 at T=61 (safe, since only unsafe at 60), etc.\n\nBut row 2 at T=60 is unsafe, so I need to not be on row 2 at T=60.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7 and 8 at T=64-66 are unsafe.\n\nIn straight up, I would be on row 7 at T=65? Let's see:\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nT=58: y=0\n\nT=59: y=1\n\nT=60: y=2 → unsafe\n\nT=61: y=3\n\nT=62: y=4\n\nT=63: y=5\n\nT=64: y=6\n\nT=65: y=7\n\nT=66: y=8\n\nT=67: y=9\n\nNow, at T=65, y=7, which is unsafe at T=65? Row 7 unsafe at T=64,65,66.\n\nT=65 is within 64-66, so unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, T=66 y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo multiple problems: T=60 on row 2 unsafe, T=65 on row 7 unsafe, T=66 on row 8 unsafe.\n\nI need to avoid these.\n\nFirst, for T=60, I need to not be on any of rows 1-6 at T=60, but since rows 1-6 are all unsafe at T=60, and I have to be on them at some time, I need to be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly for rows 7-8, avoid T=64-66.\n\nNow, since I start at T=58 y=0, and I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up when possible, but I might need to stay or go down to shift the timing.\n\nFor example, for the row 2 problem at T=60, I can be on row 2 at a different time.\n\nSince row 2 is only unsafe at T=60, I can be on it at T=59 or T=61, etc.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to go through the rows.\n\nLet me denote the time I am on each row.\n\nLet T_k be the turn when I am on row k for k=1 to 8.\n\nThen T_k must not be the unsafe time for row k.\n\nFor row 1: unsafe only at T=60, so T_1 != 60\n\nSimilarly row 2: T_2 != 60\n\n...\nrow 6: T_6 != 60\n\nrow 7: T_7 not in {64,65,66}\n\nrow 8: T_8 not in {64,65,66}\n\nNow, the sequence of T_k must be such that |T_{k+1} - T_k| =1 if I move directly, but I might stay or go down, so T_k can increase slower or decrease.\n\nSince I start at T=58 y=0, and end at some T when y=9.\n\nT_1 is the time I am on row 1, which must be after T=58 or at, but at T=58 I am at y=0, so T_1 >=59.\n\nSimilarly, T_8 <= T when I reach y=9 minus one, but when I reach y=9, I am at that turn, but before that I was on y=8.\n\nThe times T_k must satisfy T_k >=58 + min time to reach k, but min time to row k is k, since from 0.\n\nFrom y=0, to reach row k, min k turns, so T_k >= 58 + k.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, T >=58 +9=67.\n\nNow, also, since I move one row per step or stay, the times T_k must be non-decreasing, and T_{k+1} = T_k or T_k +1 or T_k -1, but since I want to minimize time, probably T_{k+1} = T_k +1 if moving up, or T_k if staying, but staying would increase time, so to minimize, I should not stay unnecessarily, only when needed.\n\nI might go down to come back later.\n\nBut going down might increase time more, so probably not efficient unless necessary.\n\nFirst, let's see the constraints.\n\nI need to set T_k for k=1 to 8 such that:\n\n- T_1 >=59\n\n- T_8 <= ? well, to reach y=9 by time T, T_8 <= T-1, since after being on y=8 I go to y=9.\n\nLet T_end be the turn when I reach y=9, so at T_end, y=9.\n\nThen at T_end -1, I am on y=8 or y=9? When I reach y=9, at that turn I am on y=9, and the previous turn I was on some y, and I moved up or something.\n\nBetter to think the turn before arrival.\n\nAt turn T_end, I am at y=9, so the action at T_end -1 must be such that y_{T_end} = y_{T_end -1} + Δy, and y_{T_end} =9.\n\nSince y_{T_end -1} <=8, so Δy could be U or S if y=9, but to reach, if y_{T_end -1} =8, action U, or if y_{T_end -1}=9, action S, but since we start from 0, we need to reach 9, so probably y_{T_end -1}=8, action U.\n\nSimilarly, I must be on y=8 at some turn before.\n\nLet T_{last8} be the turn when I am on y=8, then at that turn or later I move to y=9.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when we are on each row.\n\nSo back to T_k, the time on row k.\n\nConstraints:\n\nT_k integer, T_k >= 58 + k for each k? Not necessarily, because if I go down, I might reach k later, but since I start from 0, the earliest I can be on row k is at turn 58 + k.\n\nFor example, row 1 at earliest T=59.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at earliest T=66.\n\nAlso, T_k <= T_8 + something, but not fixed.\n\nMoreover, |T_{k+1} - T_k| <=1? Not exactly, because I can stay on a row multiple turns or skip, but since rows are consecutive, I must visit each row at least once, and when I move, I change by one row, so the times can have gaps if I stay.\n\nFor example, I can be on row k at T, then stay so on row k at T+1, then move to k+1 at T+2, etc.\n\nThe sequence T_k for different k can have T_{k+1} = T_k or T_k +1 or T_k + d for d>1 if I stay, but T_{k+1} must be at least T_k +1 if I move up, or T_k if I stay, but if I stay, I am on the same row, so for each row, T_k is the time I am on it, and for different rows, the times are different unless I stay.\n\nTo simplify, since I need to visit each row at least once, and rows must be visited in order if I don't go down, but I might go down.\n\nTo minimize time, probably I should not go down, only go up or stay, to avoid extra moves.\n\nGoing down would make me revisit rows, which takes more time, so for minimal time, I should never go down, only go up or stay when necessary.\n\nSimilarly, staying takes extra time.\n\nSo the optimal should be to go up except when I have to avoid a row at a certain time, I might stay on a safe row for one turn.\n\nIn this case, the critical points are T=60 for rows 1-6 and T=64-66 for rows 7-8.\n\nFirst, for rows 1-6, I need not to be on them at T=60.\n\nSince I must be on them at some time, and they are safe at other times.\n\nFor example, row 1: safe except T=60, so I can be on it at T=59 or T=61, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the straight up, I am on row 1 at T=59 (safe), row 2 at T=60 (unsafe), so I need to avoid being on row 2 at T=60.\n\nOne way is to be on row 2 at a different time.\n\nFor instance, if I stay on row 1 at T=59, then at T=60 I am still on row 1, which is unsafe at T=60? Row 1 is unsafe at T=60, so if I am on row 1 at T=60, collision.\n\nRow 1 is unsafe at T=60, so I cannot be on row 1 at T=60 either.\n\nSimilarly all rows 1-6 unsafe at T=60.\n\nTherefore, at T=60, I must not be on any row from 1 to 6, meaning I must be on y=0 or y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but at T=60, y=9 is not possible yet, since min time to y=9 is T=67.\n\ny=7 or 8 possible? But rows 7-8 are safe at T=60, since unsafe only later.\n\nAt T=60, for row 7: earlier, unsafe at T=64,65,66, so at T=60, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8 safe at T=60.\n\nAlso y=0 safe.\n\nSo at T=60, I need to be on y=0, or y=7, or y=8, or y=9, but y=9 too early, so y=0,7,8.\n\ny=7 or 8 means I have reached there earlier.\n\nBut min time to row 7 is 58+7=65, which is after 60, so at T=60, I cannot be on y=7 or 8 yet.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 I can be, if I stay or go down.\n\nBut I start at y=0 at T=58.\n\nAt T=58, y=0.\n\nIf I stay at T=58, action S, then at T=59, still y=0.\n\nIf I go up, at T=59, y=1.\n\nTo be safe at T=60, I need to be on y=0 or y=7 or y=8, but since I cannot reach y=7 by T=60, only possibility is to be on y=0 at T=60.\n\nThat means I must not move up from y=0 before T=60, or move down to 0, but moving down might not help.\n\nSpecifically, at T=60, I must be on y=0.\n\nThat means from T=58 to T=60, I need to be at y=0.\n\nFor example, at T=58, y=0, I can choose action S at T=58, so at T=59, y=0.\n\nThen at T=59, action S, at T=60, y=0.\n\nThen at T=60, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nBut now I have wasted two turns staying, so I will be later.\n\nAfter T=60, I can go up.\n\nBut rows 7-8 have unsafe times later.\n\nFirst, let's see the sequence.\n\nStart: T=58, y=0, safe.\n\nAction: to be at y=0 at T=60, so at T=58, action must be S or D, but y=0, D would make y=-1, not allowed, so only S or U, but if U, y=1 at T=59, then at T=59 if I go D, y=0 at T=60, but going down might not be efficient.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=60, I can:\n\nOption 1: at T=58, action S → T=59 y=0\n\nThen at T=59, action S → T=60 y=0\n\nOption 2: at T=58, action U → T=59 y=1\n\nThen at T=59, action D → T=60 y=0\n\nBut this involves a down move, which might be worse than staying, since I go to y=1 and back, wasting two actions instead of one? With stay, I use one action to stay, but I stay for one turn, so from T=58 to T=60, if I stay both times, I have two actions: S at T=58 and S at T=59, to be at y=0 at T=60.\n\nIf I go up and down, I have U at T=58 and D at T=59, also two actions, but I end up at y=0 same as start, so same net effect, but I visited y=1, which might be risky, but at T=59, row 1 is safe, as we saw, only unsafe at T=60.\n\nAt T=59, row 1 is safe, so going to y=1 and back is possible, but it takes two actions to stay at y=0 effectively, same as two S actions.\n\nBut with two S, I don't move, with U and D, I move but come back, so in terms of position, same, but I used actions.\n\nSince I need to go up eventually, staying might be better than up-down, but both cost two actions to delay by two turns.\n\nIn terms of time, both make me start from T=60 at y=0 instead of T=58.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut now I have rows 7-8 unsafe at T=64,65,66.\n\nMin time from T=60 y=0 to y=9: if go straight up, at T=61 y=1, T=62 y=2, ..., T=68 y=8, T=69 y=9.\n\nBut at T=65 y=5? Let's see:\n\nT=60: y=0\n\nAction U → T=61 y=1\n\nU → T=62 y=2\n\nU → T=63 y=3\n\nU → T=64 y=4\n\nU → T=65 y=5\n\nU → T=66 y=6\n\nU → T=67 y=7\n\nU → T=68 y=8\n\nU → T=69 y=9\n\nNow, at T=67, y=7, which is row 7, unsafe at T=64,65,66? T=67 is after 66, so safe? Row 7 unsafe at T=64,65,66, so T=67 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=68 y=8, row 8 unsafe at T=64,65,66, so T=68 safe.\n\nT=69 y=9 safe.\n\nBut at T=64, y=4, which is row 4, but row 4 is only unsafe at T=60, which is past, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all rows 1-6 are safe except at T=60, which we avoided.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=64, y=4, row 4 safe.\n\nT=65 y=5, row 5 safe.\n\nT=66 y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nT=67 y=7, row 7: unsafe at T=64,65,66, T=67=67-58=9, ΔT=9, which for row 7, earlier we had unsafe for ΔT=6,7,8 i.e. T=64,65,66, so T=67 safe.\n\nSimilarly T=68 y=8, row 8 safe.\n\nSo this seems safe.\n\nBut I reached at T=69, with actions from T=60 to T=68? Let's count the turns.\n\nI started from T=60 at y=0.\n\nThen actions:\n\nT=60: action U → T=61 y=1\n\nT=61: U → T=62 y=2\n\nT=62: U → T=63 y=3\n\nT=63: U → T=64 y=4\n\nT=64: U → T=65 y=5\n\nT=65: U → T=66 y=6\n\nT=66: U → T=67 y=7\n\nT=67: U → T=68 y=8\n\nT=68: U → T=69 y=9\n\nSo actions at turns T=60 to T=68, that's 9 actions, reaching at T=69.\n\nBut I had to stay from T=58 to T=60, which took two actions: at T=58 and T=59, both S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, from beginning:\n\nT=58: y=0, to be at y=0 at T=60, so at T=58, action S → T=59 y=0\n\nT=59: action S → T=60 y=0\n\nThen T=60: U → T=61 y=1\n\n...\n\nUp to T=68: U → T=69 y=9\n\nActions at turns: T=58 (S), T=59 (S), T=60 (U), T=61 (U), ..., T=68 (U)\n\nThat's 11 actions: two S and nine U.\n\nH=11 turns.\n\nBut earlier if I could go faster, but with the constraint.\n\nIs there a way to take less time?\n\nFor example, instead of staying two turns, maybe I can stay only one turn or something.\n\nBut at T=60, I must not be on rows 1-6, so I must be on y=0 or y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7,8 not reachable by T=60, so only y=0.\n\nThus I must be on y=0 at T=60.\n\nTherefore, I need to delay so that I am still at y=0 at T=60.\n\nSo I must have actions at T=58 and T=59 that keep me at y=0.\n\nEither both S, or one S and one D but since y=0, D not possible, so only both S: S at T=58 and S at T=59.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut in the up sequence, I go from y=0 at T=60 to y=9 at T=69, which is 9 actions, total 11 actions including the two S.\n\nBut I need to check rows 7-8.\n\nIn the sequence above, I am on row 7 at T=67, which is safe, row 8 at T=68, safe.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at T=64,65,66, and I am on it at T=67, fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut H=11, is it minimal?\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=7 or y=8 earlier to avoid the unsafe times, but min time to y=7 is T=65, which is within unsafe period for row 7 if I am on it.\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 7 before T=64 or after T=66.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nIn the current plan, I am on row 7 at T=67, after T=66, safe.\n\nBut can I be on row 7 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start going up immediately but skip or something, but I have to go through all rows.\n\nSuppose I go up faster to reach row 7 before T=64.\n\nT=64 is ΔT=6 from t_1=58.\n\nMin time to row 7: from y=0 at T=58, with 7 up moves, at T=65 y=7.\n\nT=58: y=0, action U → T=59 y=1\n\nU → T=60 y=2, but T=60 y=2 is unsafe, as before.\n\nBut if I avoid T=60, I need to be at y=0 at T=60, so I cannot reach y=7 by T=64.\n\nT=64 is turn 64, which is 6 turns after 58, so from T=58 to T=64, 6 actions, I can be at y=6 at most, if all U.\n\nAt T=64, y=6, row 6, which is safe since row 6 unsafe only at T=60.\n\nBut to reach row 7, I need to be at y=7 at some turn.\n\nEarliest possible after avoiding T=60.\n\nSince I must be at y=0 at T=60, then from T=60 y=0, I can go up.\n\nAt T=61 y=1, T=62 y=2, T=63 y=3, T=64 y=4, T=65 y=5, T=66 y=6, T=67 y=7, T=68 y=8, T=69 y=9.\n\nAs before.\n\nAt T=67 y=7, which is after T=66, so safe for row 7.\n\nBut row 7 unsafe at T=64,65,66, so T=67 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I want to be on row 7 at T=63 or earlier, but T=63 is only 5 turns from start, y=5 max, cannot reach y=7.\n\nT=58 to T=63: 5 actions, y=5 at T=63.\n\nThen T=64 y=6, T=65 y=7, but at T=65, y=7, which is row 7 at T=65, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay somewhere to delay.\n\nBut in our case, with the delay at start, we are on row 7 at T=67, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 7 at T=63, impossible.\n\nOr after T=66, like T=67.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, another thing: rows 7-8 are unsafe at T=64,65,66, so I need to be on row 7 not at those times, similarly for row 8.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on row 7 at T=67, row 8 at T=68, both safe.\n\nCan I be on row 7 earlier? No, because of the initial delay.\n\nWithout initial delay, but I have to avoid T=60.\n\nSuppose I go up to some row before T=60, but not on row 1-6 at T=60.\n\nFor example, at T=58: U → T=59 y=1 (safe)\n\nThen at T=59: instead of U to y=2 at T=60, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut at T=59, y=1, if I stay, action S, then at T=60 y=1, but row 1 unsafe at T=60, collision.\n\nIf I go down, to y=0 at T=60, which is safe.\n\nSo at T=59: action D → T=60 y=0\n\nThen at T=60, y=0 safe.\n\nThen from there, same as before: go up starting T=60.\n\nBut now, at T=58: U → T=59 y=1\n\nT=59: D → T=60 y=0\n\nThen T=60: U → T=61 y=1, but I was at y=1 at T=59, now back to y=1 at T=61, so I wasted two actions to go to y=1 and back, whereas in the first plan, I stayed at y=0 for two turns with S S.\n\nIn terms of position at T=60, same, but I visited y=1, which was safe at T=59.\n\nNow from T=60 y=0, same as before, go up to T=69 y=9.\n\nBut I have one extra action: at T=58 U, T=59 D, T=60 U, etc., so to reach y=9 at T=69, same as before, but I used U and D instead of two S.\n\nBut number of actions is the same: two actions to get to T=60 y=0, then nine up to y=9, total 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at T=58: U, T=59: D, T=60: U, T=61: U, ..., T=68: U, then at T=69 y=9.\n\nActions from T=58 to T=68, 11 actions.\n\nSame as S at T=58, S at T=59, U from T=60 to T=68.\n\nIn the S S case, actions T=58 S, T=59 S, T=60 U, T=61 U, ..., T=68 U (to reach T=69 y=9).\n\nT=68 action U, T=69 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the U D case, I have y=1 at T=59, which is fine, but same number of actions.\n\nPerhaps I can save time by not staying the full two turns.\n\nBut I must avoid T=60 on rows 1-6, so I must be on y=0 at T=60, no choice.\n\nUnless I can be on y=7 or 8, but impossible.\n\nSo H=11 is necessary? But let's see if I can reach faster by being on rows 7-8 at different times.\n\nFor example, after T=60, I go up, but for rows 7-8, I need to avoid T=64,65,66.\n\nIn the current sequence, I am on row 7 at T=67>66, safe.\n\nBut if I could be on row 7 before T=64.\n\nFor instance, at T=63 or earlier.\n\nBut from T=60 y=0, at T=61 y=1, T=62 y=2, T=63 y=3, T=64 y=4, cannot reach y=7 by T=63.\n\nT=63 is y=3, etc.\n\nSo impossible to reach row 7 before T=64 with the delay.\n\nWithout delay, but I cannot because of T=60.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go up to y=6 quickly and stay there during the unsafe times for rows 7-8, but rows 7-8 are different.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=6 by some time.\n\nFirst, min to y=6: T=64 if start from T=58 with all U, but at T=60 I need to be at y=0, so cannot.\n\nWith delay, earliest at y=6: from T=60 y=0, T=61 y=1, T=62 y=2, T=63 y=3, T=64 y=4, T=65 y=5, T=66 y=6.\n\nAt T=66, y=6, row 6.\n\nNow row 6 is safe, since only unsafe at T=60.\n\nNow at T=66, I am on y=6, but rows 7-8 are unsafe at T=64,65,66, so if I go to y=7 at T=67, as before.\n\nIf I stay on y=6 at T=66, then at T=67 I am still on y=6, then I can go to y=7 at T=68, etc., but that would take more time.\n\nFor example, at T=66 y=6, action S → T=67 y=6, then U → T=68 y=7, U → T=69 y=8, U → T=70 y=9, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTo avoid being on row 7 during T=64-66, I need to be on it before or after.\n\nBefore: impossible as above.\n\nAfter: like at T=67.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nIn the current plan, with two S at start, then up all, I reach at T=69.\n\nBut can I reduce the delay?\n\nFor example, instead of two S, only one S.\n\nBut I must be at y=0 at T=60.\n\nIf at T=58, I do S, then at T=59 y=0.\n\nThen at T=59, if I do U, then at T=60 y=1, but row 1 unsafe at T=60, collision.\n\nIf at T=59 I do S, then at T=60 y=0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at T=58 I do U, to T=59 y=1, then at T=59 do D, to T=60 y=0.\n\nSame as U D.\n\nNo saving.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the row 7 and 8.\n\nIn the sequence: after T=60 y=0\n\nT=61 y=1: row 1, at T=61, safe (only unsafe at T=60)\n\nT=62 y=2: row 2, at T=62, safe\n\nSimilarly, T=63 y=3: row 3, safe\n\nT=64 y=4: row 4, safe\n\nT=65 y=5: row 5, safe\n\nT=66 y=6: row 6, safe\n\nT=67 y=7: row 7, at T=67. Now for row 7, unsafe at T=64,65,66, T=67: ΔT=67-58=9, for row 7 car, the third car: span at T=67: ΔT=9, low= -35 +4*9= -35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, both >0, 0 not in. Other cars not cover 0, so safe.\n\nT=68 y=8: row 8, similarly, at T=68, ΔT=10, span for third car: low=-35+40=5, high=-24+40=16>0, safe.\n\nT=69 y=9 safe.\n\nNow, in the beginning, with two S: at T=58 S, y=0\n\nT=59 S, y=0\n\nThen T=60 U, y=1 at T=61? No:\n\nAt turn t, action determines y_{t+1}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 58: action, say S, then at turn 59, y=0\n\nTurn 59: action S, then at turn 60, y=0\n\nTurn 60: action U, then at turn 61, y=1\n\nTurn 61: action U, then at turn 62, y=2\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 68: action U, then at turn 69, y=9\n\nActions from turn 58 to 68, that's 11 actions.\n\nBut the sequence should be for turns starting from t_1=58.\n\nIn the answer, it should list actions for t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere t_1=58, after 11 actions, at turn 58+11=69, y=9.\n\nActions at turns 58 to 68.\n\nNow, but I think I can save one turn by not staying the full time, but I don't see how.\n\nAnother thought: for rows 7-8, since they are unsafe only at specific times, and I am passing late, but perhaps I can pass row 7 and 8 before T=64.\n\nBut to do that, I need to be at y=7 before T=64, say T=63.\n\nBut from start, min T=65 for y=7.\n\nT=58 y=0, U at T=58 → T=59 y=1, U → T=60 y=2, but T=60 y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf I could be on y=2 at T=59 or T=61.\n\nBut at T=59, if I am on y=2, that means I moved up twice from T=58 to T=59? No.\n\nAt T=58, y=0, action U → T=59 y=1\n\nAt T=59, action U → T=60 y=2\n\nSo I can only be on y=2 at T=60 earliest.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at T=63, I need to be at y=6 at T=62, y=5 at T=61, etc., but at T=60 I must be at y= something not 1-6, impossible except y=0.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=6 and stay during T=64-66, but then I am on row 6, which is safe, and after that go to row 7.\n\nBut at T=66, if I am on y=6, then I can go to y=7 at T=67, same as before.\n\nIf I stay on y=6 from T=64 to T=66, for example, but that takes extra turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal is with two delays at start.\n\nBut in the sequence, with two S or U and D.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the action sequence.\n\nBut in the U and D case, I go to y=1 and back, but it might be acceptable, but since the position is the same, and same number of actions, I can choose either.\n\nBut staying might be simpler.\n\nNow, but let's check if at T=59, y=1 is safe.\n\nRow 1 at T=59: ΔT=1, car span: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=59, action D to y=0 at T=60, safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in terms of the path, it's fine.\n\nBut perhaps for consistency, I'll use the stay sequence.\n\nNow, one more thing: in the up sequence, at T=67 y=7, but row 7 has multiple cars, but we checked the span.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for freeway 7, at T=67, as above, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10 actions, then I reach y=9 at turn 58+10=68.\n\nThat means net up moves must be 9, down moves d, stays s, with u - d =9, and u + d + s =10, so 2u + s =19, u=9, d=0, s=1? u - d =9, u + d + s =10, subtract, (u+d+s) - (u-d) =10 -9, so 2d + s =1.\n\nSince d and s nonneg int, possible d=0, s=1 or d=1, s=-1 impossible, so d=0, s=1.\n\nSo one stay and nine up moves.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 T=58.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at T=68 y=9.\n\nThe stay must be at some point.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on rows 1-6 at T=60.\n\nAlso avoid rows 7-8 at T=64,65,66.\n\nNow, with one stay, I can delay one turn.\n\nBut to avoid T=60 on rows 1-6, I need to be at y=0 at T=60.\n\nAt T=60, y=0.\n\nNow, from T=58 to T=60.\n\nAt T=58, y=0.\n\nIf I do S at T=58, then at T=59 y=0.\n\nThen at T=59, if I do S, then at T=60 y=0, but that's two stays, but we have only one stay for H=10.\n\nIf at T=58 I do U, then at T=59 y=1.\n\nThen at T=59, if I do S, then at T=60 y=1, but row 1 unsafe at T=60.\n\nIf at T=59 I do D, then at T=60 y=0, but that is a down move, which we don't have, since d=0.\n\nIn this case for H=10, d=0, s=1, so no down moves.\n\nTherefore, at T=59, if y=1, I cannot do D, only U or S.\n\nIf U, to y=2 at T=60, unsafe.\n\nIf S, to y=1 at T=60, unsafe.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at T=59 to have choice.\n\nBut at T=58, if I do S, then at T=59 y=0.\n\nThen at T=59, I can do S to stay at y=0 for T=60, but that requires two S, but for H=10, I have only one S to use, but here I need to use S at T=58 or T=59.\n\nSuppose at T=58, I do S, so at T=59 y=0.\n\nThen at T=59, since I have to go up, and s=1, I can do U at T=59, but then at T=60 y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf I do S at T=59, but then at T=60 y=0, but I used S at T=58 and S at T=59, but that's two S, but for H=10, I should have only one S, but with two S, I have more actions.\n\nFor H=10, I need exactly one stay and nine ups.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=60, I need either to stay at T=58 and T=59, but that would be two stays, or go up and down, but down not allowed.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=0 at T=60 with only one action that is not up, but I need two non-up actions to stay at y=0 for two turns.\n\nSpecifically, from T=58 to T=60, I need to choose actions such that y_{59} =0 and y_{60}=0.\n\nAt T=58, action: if S, y_{59}=0; if U, y_{59}=1.\n\nThen at T=59, action: depends.\n\nTo have y_{60}=0, if y_{59}=0, I can do S or D but D invalid, so S.\n\nIf y_{59}=1, I can do D to y_{60}=0.\n\nBut in H=10 with d=0, I cannot do D.\n\nTherefore, only way is to have y_{59}=0 and at T=59 action S to y_{60}=0.\n\nBut to have y_{59}=0, at T=58 I must do S (since if U, y_{59}=1).\n\nSo I must do S at T=58 and S at T=59, two stays.\n\nBut for H=10, I can have only one stay, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible to have H=10; I must have at least two non-up actions to handle the delay at start.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nSimilarly, for the end, no issue.\n\nSo we proceed with H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I can use two S at start or U and D.\n\nBut since the problem might prefer no down if possible, I'll use two S.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: S\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U  (to y=8 at T=68?

The cars on each freeway move according to their specified rules, and collisions must be avoided at each turn when the player is on a freeway row \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Unsafe Times\n- Freeways 1 to 6 each have a car that is unsafe only at turn \\(T = 60\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 58\\), \\(\\Delta T = 2\\)).\n- Freeways 7 and 8 each have three cars, with the third car causing the row to be unsafe at turns \\(T = 64, 65, 66\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 58\\), \\(\\Delta T = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n\nTo avoid collisions:\n- The player must not be on any row from 1 to 6 at turn 60, requiring the player to be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 60.\n- The player must not be on row 7 or 8 at turns 64, 65, or 66.\n\n### Strategy\n- **Delay at start**: To be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 60, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 58 and 59 using actions \\(S\\) (stay).\n- **Ascend after turn 60**: From turn 60 onwards, the player moves up (\\(U\\)) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible.\n- **Timing for rows 7 and 8**: With this sequence, the player is on row 7 at turn 67 and row 8 at turn 68, both safe times (after the unsafe window of turns 64–66).\n\n### Action Sequence\n- The sequence consists of 11 actions (minimal \\(H = 11\\)), starting from turn 58 to turn 68, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 69.\n- Actions:\n  - Turns 58 and 59: \\(S\\) to stay at \\(y = 0\\) and avoid being on rows 1–6 at turn 60.\n  - Turns 60 to 68: \\(U\\) to move up one row per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 69.\n\n### Verification\n- **Turn 60**: At \\(y = 0\\), safe (no cars on row 0).\n- **Turns 61–66**: On rows 1–6 at turns 61–66, all safe since rows 1–6 are unsafe only at turn 60.\n- **Turn 67**: On row 7 at turn 67, safe (unsafe only at turns 64–66; at turn 67, \\(\\Delta T = 9\\), car spans do not cover 0).\n- **Turn 68**: On row 8 at turn 68, safe (similar to row 7).\n- **Turn 69**: At \\(y = 9\\), safe (no cars on row 9).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns (11 actions) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ } U \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t₁ = 60, and I start at y=0. I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and I must stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways 1 to 8, each with their positions and speeds. I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position x=0 at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only care about the car on the row I'm currently on.\n\nLet me list out the car states clearly.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car with head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed 36.

The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t = -1 for D, but y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, then y_{t+1} = 0 + (-1) but must be >=0, so probably y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy_t))\n\nSimilarly for up at 9.\n\nSo at y=0, if D or S, y=0; if U, y=1.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, if U or S, y=9; if D, y=8.\n\nSo from y=0 at τ=0:\n\nAfter a_{60}:\n\n- U: y=1 at τ=1\n\n- S: y=0 at τ=1\n\n- D: y=0 at τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, depending on position, a_{61}:\n\nCase: at τ=1, y=1\n\nThen a_{61}:\n\n- U: y=2 at τ=2\n\n- S: y=1 at τ=2\n\n- D: y=0 at τ=2\n\nCase: at τ=1, y=0\n\nThen a_{61}:\n\n- U: y=1 at τ=2\n\n- S: y=0 at τ=2\n\n- D: y=0 at τ=2\n\nSo at τ=2, possible y: from above, can be 0,1,2.\n\nSpecifically, y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut at τ=2, turn 62, y must not be 1,2,3,4,5,6, so y must be 0,7,8,9.\n\nBut with two actions, I can only reach y=0,1,2 from start, so I cannot reach y=7,8,9 by τ=2.\n\nTherefore, at turn 62, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nBecause y=1,2 are unsafe, and I can only be at y=0,1,2, so must be at y=0.\n\nNow, from above, how to be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nFrom start:\n\n- If I do S or D at τ=0, I am at y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, if I do S or D, I stay at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nIf I do U at τ=1, I go to y=1 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I do U at τ=0, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, if I do D, to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nIf I do S, to y=1 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I do U, to y=2 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nSo to be at y=0 at τ=2, I must:\n\nEither:\n\n- a_{60} = S or D, then a_{61} = S or D (stay at 0)\n\nor\n\n- a_{60} = U, to y=1 at τ=1, then a_{61} = D, to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nIn both cases, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nNow, after that, I need to go to y=9.\n\nAlso, later for y=7 and 8, unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nτ=6 is turn 66, τ=7 turn 67, τ=8 turn 68.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at turns 66,67,68.\n\nSince I start from τ=0, and need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, at τ=2, I must be at y=0.\n\nThen from there, I can start moving up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, and avoid the later unsafe times.\n\nNow, minimal H: if no obstacles, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, but I have to wait at least until after turn 62.\n\nAt τ=2, I am at y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so from y=0 at τ=2 to y=9, minimum 9 moves, arriving at τ=11, turn 71.\n\nBut I might go faster or slower, but since I can only move one step at a time, minimum is 9 moves from there.\n\nFrom τ=2, y=0, after k moves, at τ=2+k, y between max(0, y0 -k) and min(9, y0 +k), but since I go up, y increases.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some S or D, but D would make it slower, so minimal is 9 up moves in a row, arriving at y=9 at τ=2+9=11.\n\nBut during this, I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nτ=6 is turn 66, which is τ=6.\n\nτ=2+k, where k is the number of actions from τ=2 onwards.\n\nSet τ' = τ - 2, so after turn 62.\n\nAt τ=2, turn 62, y=0.\n\nThen actions from turn 62 onwards.\n\nLet τ' = 0 at turn 62.\n\nSo at τ'=0, y=0.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9 at some τ' = H', with actions from τ'=0 to τ'=H'-1, arrive at τ'=H'.\n\nMinimal H'=9, arrive at τ'=9, y=9.\n\nNow, τ' corresponds to absolute τ: τ = τ' + 2.\n\nAbsolute turn: at τ'=0, turn 62; τ'=1, turn 63; ... τ'=t, turn 62 + t.\n\nNow, unsafe for y=7 and 8 at absolute turns 66,67,68.\n\nTurn 66: τ =6, since τ=0 at turn 60, turn 66 is τ=6.\n\nτ=6: τ' = τ - 2 = 4?

Actions from t=60 to t=70, that's 11 actions? t from 60 to 70 inclusive?\n\nSequence: actions at t=60,61,62,...,70, that's 11 actions, to arrive at t=71.\n\nt=60 to t=70 is 11 turns, actions at each, then position at t=71.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for H actions, from t=60 to t=60 + H -1, arrive at t=60 + H.\n\nSet t=60 + H.\n\nWith above, I arrive at t=71, so 60 + H =71, H=11.\n\nBut I could start moving earlier.\n\nFor example, instead of waiting at turn 60 and 61, I can go up and down.\n\nOption: a_{60}=U, to y=1 at t=61\n\nThen a_{61}=D, to y=0 at t=62\n\nStill at t=62 y=0.\n\nThen from t=62, same as before, go up to y=9 at t=71.\n\nSame H=11.\n\nBut at t=61, I was at y=1, which is safe, since unsafe only at t=62.\n\nThen I go down to y=0 at t=62.\n\nThen up from there.\n\nBut same time.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nMinimal H: from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves, but I have to spend at least two moves to handle the turn 62 issue, but in this case, I used two moves to stay or go down, but I didn't gain position.\n\nIn the first two turns, I either stay or go up and down, ending at y=0 at t=62.\n\nThen 9 up moves to y=9 at t=71.\n\nTotal actions: from t=60 to t=70, 11 actions.\n\nt=60,61,62,...,70: 11 actions.\n\nArrive at t=71.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster later, but no, because I have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: after t=62, I go up, but I need to avoid y=7 and 8 at t=66,67,68.\n\nIn the path above, at t=66, I am at y=4, not 7 or 8.\n\nt=66: y=4, t=67:y=5, t=68:y=6, all safe.\n\nThen t=69:y=7, safe, etc.\n\nBut I could go slower or faster to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if I go up slower, I might be at lower y during unsafe times, but in this case, since y=7 and 8 unsafe only at specific times, and I am not there, it's fine.\n\nBut in this path, I reach at t=71 with H=11.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=62, I am at y=0, then I go up as fast as possible, but 9 moves, arrive at t=71.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at a higher y at t=62, but earlier we saw I cannot, because at t=62 I must be at y=0, since I can only be at y=0,1,2 and 1,2 unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be at y=7 or 8 at t=62, but from start in two moves, impossible.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at t=62.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can arrive at y=9 is t=71, with 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the timing.\n\nt=60: start y=0\n\na_{60}: say S, then t=61: y=0\n\na_{61}: S, t=62: y=0\n\na_{62}: U, t=63: y=1\n\na_{63}: U, t=64: y=2\n\na_{64}: U, t=65: y=3\n\na_{65}: U, t=66: y=4\n\nt=66: y=4, freeway 4, but unsafe only at t=62, so at t=66, no car at x=0, safe.\n\na_{66}: U, t=67: y=5\n\nt=67: y=5, safe\n\na_{67}: U, t=68: y=6\n\nt=68: y=6, safe\n\na_{68}: U, t=69: y=7\n\nt=69: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at t=66,67,68? t=69 is later, so safe.\n\na_{69}: U, t=70: y=8\n\nt=70: y=8, safe\n\na_{70}: U, t=71: y=9, done.\n\nActions from t=60 to t=70, that's t=60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70: 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut I could have a_{60}=U, then a_{61}=D, then same from t=62.\n\na_{60}=U: t=61 y=1\n\na_{61}=D: t=62 y=0\n\nThen a_{62}=U: t=63 y=1\n\netc., same as above, arrive t=71.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure about y=7 and 8 at unsafe times.\n\nIn this path, at t=66 (y=4), t=67 (y=5), t=68 (y=6), not on 7 or 8.\n\nThen t=69 y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to arrive earlier?\n\nSuppose I go up faster before, but I cannot, because I have to be at y=0 at t=62.\n\nFor example, if I go up at t=60 to y=1 at t=61, but at t=61 y=1 is safe, but then at t=62 I need to be at y=0, so I must go down at t=61.\n\nSo I cannot be higher.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=62, but then go up faster, but I can only increase by 1 per turn, so from y=0 at t=62, I need at least 9 turns to y=9.\n\nThus minimal arrival at t=71.\n\nBut t=71 is τ=11.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can reach y=9 before t=71 by going up during the initial phase, but I cannot because of the constraint at t=62.\n\nFor example, if I go up at t=60 and t=61, I would be at y=2 at t=62, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce by not going directly.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=9 but avoid being on certain rows at certain times, but in this case, since the only constraints are at t=62 for y=1-6 and t=66-68 for y=7-8, and in the path I have, I avoid them all, and it's direct after t=62.\n\nPerhaps I can be at a higher y earlier to save time, but I cannot due to t=62.\n\nAnother idea: what about y=9? I can be there earlier if possible, but from start, to reach y=9 quickly, but I have to go through the lower rows, which are unsafe at t=62.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at t=69, that would require from t=60 to t=69, 9 actions, but at t=62, I would be at some y between, say if I go all U, at t=62 y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go slower, at t=62 I might be at y=0 or 1, but y=1 unsafe at t=62.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=62, so if at t=62 y=1, collision.\n\nSo the only safe at t=62 is y=0, as we have.\n\nThus impossible to be at y=9 before t=71.\n\nt=71 is the earliest.\n\nBut t=70: if I arrive at y=9 at t=70, that means after actions from t=60 to t=69, 10 actions.\n\nBut at t=62, I need to be at y=0.\n\nFrom t=60 to t=69: actions at t=60 to 69, 10 actions, arrive at t=70.\n\nAt t=62, y=0.\n\nThen from t=62 to t=70, 8 actions? From t=62 to t=69 actions, 8 actions? Let's index.\n\nAt t=62, y=0 (before action).\n\nAfter a_{62}, at t=63, y=...\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=70, after a_{69}, y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=62 to y=9 at t=70, that is 8 steps: from t=63 to t=70, 8 positions, but y changes from after a_{62} to after a_{69}.\n\nAt t=62, before action, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{62}, at t=63, y= y_{62} + Δy_{62} = 0 + Δy_{62}\n\nThen after a_{63}, at t=64, y= y_{63} + Δy_{63}, and so on, up to after a_{69}, at t=70, y=9.\n\nThe actions are a_{62} to a_{69}, 8 actions, changing y from 0 to some value.\n\ny_{63} = Δy_{62} (since y_{62}=0)\n\ny_{64} = y_{63} + Δy_{63} = Δy_{62} + Δy_{63}\n\n...\n\ny_{70} = y_{69} + Δy_{69}\n\nBut y_{70} =9\n\nNow, each Δy between -1 and 1, but to increase to 9, I need the sum of Δy from t=62 to t=69 to be 9, but y_{70} = y_{62} + sum_{i=62}^{69} Δy_i = 0 + sum of 8 terms, each at most 1, so sum <=8, thus y_{70} <=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny_{70} = y_{62} + Δy_{62} + Δy_{63} + ... + Δy_{69}\n\ny_{62} =0\n\nΔy for t=62 to t=69: 8 actions, each Δy = -1,0,1.\n\ny_{70} = 0 + sum_{k=62}^{69} Δy_k\n\nTo have y_{70}=9, sum must be 9.\n\nBut there are 8 terms, each <=1, so sum <=8 <9, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 at t=70.\n\nSimilarly, earliest possible is t=71, with 9 up moves from t=62.\n\ny_{71} = y_{62} + sum_{k=62}^{70} Δy_k = 0 + sum of 9 terms.\n\nWith all U, sum=9, y=9.\n\nWith fewer U, less, so only with all U from t=62 to t=70, arrive at t=71.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first two actions, I can choose different ways to be at y=0 at t=62.\n\nFor example, I can do a_{60}=S, a_{61}=S\n\nOr a_{60}=D, a_{61}=D\n\nOr a_{60}=U, a_{61}=D\n\nAll result in y=0 at t=62.\n\nThen from t=62 to t=70, all U.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=60 and t=61, I need to choose actions.\n\nTo be consistent, I can choose, say, a_{60}=S, a_{61}=S, then all U.\n\nBut let's write the turn.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, in this path, I am on y=7 at t=69, which is safe, but let me confirm the car positions.\n\nAt t=69, for freeway 7.\n\nt=69, absolute turn, ΔT = T - t₁ = 69 - 60 =9\n\nFor freeway 7, cars:\n\nFirst car: not at x=0, as before.\n\nSecond car: not.\n\nThird car: at ΔT=9, span: [-35 +4*9, -24 +4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], so x=0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not at x=0.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 same.\n\nAt t=68, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, all good.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are three cars each, but we checked only the third one can be at x=0, at ΔT=6,7,8.\n\nOther cars never at x=0.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nI need to write the sequence from turn 60 to turn 70.\n\nActions: a_{60} to a_{70}\n\nWith a_{60}, a_{61}, then a_{62} to a_{70} all U.\n\nBut a_{60} and a_{61} need to be set.\n\nI can choose a_{60}=S, a_{61}=S.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 60: action, etc.\n\nAnswer format: for each turn, the action.\n\nNow, turns from t=60 to t=70.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nSince H=11, sequence from t=60 to t=60+10=70? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10, actions at t₁ + t for t=0 to 10, so turns 60 to 70.\n\nThen position at turn 71.\n\nYes.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 60: S (for example)\n\nTurn 61: S\n\nThen Turn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nAt turn 70 action U, to y=9 at turn 71.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 11 actions: turn 60 to 70.\n\nI could have a_{60}=U, a_{61}=D, then same.\n\nBut S or D at beginning is fine.\n\nNow, but in the initial, I have to specify.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, is there any other unsafe time? I think not.\n\nBut let me double-check for y=7 at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 66, y=7 unsafe, but in my path, at turn 66, I am at y=4, not 7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go up slower to avoid, but no need.\n\nSince I have to go through all rows, and I do it efficiently.\n\nBut in this case, H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the later unsafe times, but in this path, I pass y=7 and 8 after the unsafe period.\n\nSuppose I want to minimize time, but I think it's not possible less than 11.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 before by going down or something, but that would take more time, not less.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4,5,6, we have cars, but unsafe only at t=62, so other times safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 66, y=4, which is freeway 4, at ΔT=6, turn 66.\n\nFor freeway 4: τ=-71, h=-48, s=24, at ΔT=6, span: [-71 +24*6, -48 +24*6] = [-71+144, -48+144] = [73,96], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nI think any choice for first two is fine.\n\nSet a_{60} = S, a_{61} = S, then all U.\n\nTo save space or something, but not necessary.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, the player position is (0, y), but x is always 0, I think, since moving vertically.\n\nThe cars move horizontally.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 60: S\n\nTurn 61: S\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nAfter Turn 70 action U, at turn 71, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=60 to t=70.\n\nI could have Turn 60: U, Turn 61: D, then same from Turn 62.\n\nBut S and S is fine.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can have a shorter sequence.\n\nSuppose I go up immediately after.\n\nFor example, at turn 60: U, to y=1 at t=61\n\nThen turn 61: D, to y=0 at t=62\n\nThen turn 62: U, to y=1 at t=63\n\n...\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo savings.\n\nIf I do nothing for two turns, then go up.\n\nAll same.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) is 11.

We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=0 and want to reach y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: The player is only on a freeway at turn T if they are at that y at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the update is: at turn t, the player chooses an action and then moves to y_{t+1}. The note says: if at turn T you move to y_{T+1} != y_T, then at turn T you are on y_T and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}. So when checking collision at turn T, we look at the freeway y_T (the current y) and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: The player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. So at turn t, the player is on freeway y_t (if y_t is between 1 and 8). If y_t is 0 or 9, then there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1 to 8).\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=62 for the cars on each freeway.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car, the span at any future turn T (relative to t1, so T = t1 + dt, where dt>=0).\n\nLet me denote:\n  dt = T - t1   [so at current turn, dt=0]\n\nFor a car given at t1 (dt=0) with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n\nIf direction is 'right':\n   At time t1: the car spans from tail to head (and note that head > tail because it's moving right? Actually, the representation: \n      for right: the span at t1 is [tail, head] and head>tail? The update for right: \n          Span(T) = [tail + s*(dt), head + s*(dt)]\n\nSimilarly, for left: \n      Span(T) = [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt]   (and note that in the given, for left we have head and tail? Actually the example only has right-moving cars in the given state.)\n\nLooking at the given cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> wait, -48 and -83? and right? Then at t1 (dt=0), the span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48]? But the update for right is: [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt]. So at dt=0: [ -83, -48 ].\n\nBut the representation in the table: for freeway 7 and 8, we have multiple cars. For example, freeway 7: \n   (48, 37, right, 4) -> that would be [37, 48] at t1? But 37 to 48? Then moving right.\n\nBut the problem says: for right-moving: at t1: span = [tau, h] -> meaning [tail, head]. So the first number is head? and the second is tail? \n\nWait, the problem says:\n   For car k: \"head at h, tail at tau\" and then the update.\n\nIn the table, the representation is: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut then for the update:\n\nLeft-moving: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] -> so the head is h and tail is tau? and the car is moving left so the entire car shifts left.\n\nRight-moving: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] -> but wait, the problem says: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] for right.\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). \n   So head = -48, tail = -83? Then at t1, the span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48]. \n\nBut then the update for right: \n   Span(T) = [ -83 + 36*dt, -48 + 36*dt ]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> span at t1: [-71, -48]? But wait, the representation: the table says (head, tail) so head=-48, tail=-71? Then the span is [tail, head] = [-71, -48]? But the update for right: [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt] = [-71+24*dt, -48+24*dt].\n\nBut then the car is moving right, so the entire car moves to the right.\n\nNow for freeway 7: \n   (48, 37, right, 4) -> head=48, tail=37 -> so at t1: [37,48]? \n   (12, 1, right, 4) -> [1,12]\n   (-24, -35, right, 4) -> head=-24, tail=-35 -> [-35,-24]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is the y-coordinate at turn T) and if at that turn T, there is a car on freeway y such that 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway we are on (from 1 to 8) at each turn, whether 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 at turn t1=62. We are not on any freeway (since y=0) so no collision at turn t1.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\nWe can plan a path that moves up, down, or stays. We want the minimal number of turns.\n\nNote: We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So we need at least 9 moves (if we go up 9 times). But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe have to avoid collisions at every turn from t1 (but note at t1 we are at y=0, so safe) until the turn we are at y=9 (which is safe because y=9 is not a freeway).\n\nSo we are only vulnerable when we are at y in {1,2,...,8} at a turn.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car, the positions at future turns. Since the cars move continuously, we can compute the span at any integer turn.\n\nBut note: the spans are real intervals? The head and tail are integers? Actually, the given numbers are integers, and the update is linear. However, the positions are integers? The problem doesn't specify, but the x-coordinate is continuous? But the collision condition is 0 in the span. Since the player is at x=0, we care about whether the interval [tail(T), head(T)] (for right) or [head(T), tail(T)]? Actually, for a right-moving car, the span is [tail(T), head(T)] and for left-moving, [head(T), tail(T)]? But note the left-moving update: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] -> and since the car is moving left, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order. But the collision condition is: 0 is in the span. So we just check 0 is between the two endpoints.\n\nSo for a car at freeway k at turn T (dt = T - t1 = T-62):\n\nWe have the car parameters: (head0, tail0, direction, speed)\n\nIf direction is 'right':\n   tail(T) = tail0 + s * (T - 62)\n   head(T) = head0 + s * (T - 62)\n   The span is [tail(T), head(T)] (and note tail0 < head0? In the given, for right: tail0 is the left end and head0 the right end? But in freeway1: tail0=-83, head0=-48 -> so tail0 < head0.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n   head(T) = head0 - s * (T-62)\n   tail(T) = tail0 - s * (T-62)\n   And the span is [head(T), tail(T)]? But wait, the update says: [head0 - s*dt, tail0 - s*dt]. Now, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be the leftmost? But in the update, if head0 > tail0, then head0 - s*dt > tail0 - s*dt, so the interval is [head(T), tail(T)]? But then if head0>tail0, then the head is the rightmost? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read the update:\n\nLeft-moving: \n   \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo at t1, the span is [h, tau]. Then at T, it's [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. \n\nNow, if the car is moving left, then at t1, the head (front) is at h and the tail at tau. And since it's moving left, the head is the leftmost? Actually, if the car moves left, then the entire car shifts left. So if at t1 the car occupies [h, tau] (with h < tau) then after moving left, the car would be [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So the head (the front of the car) is at the left end? Then h would be the leftmost and tau the rightmost? But the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\", so we assume that for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost? But then the span [h, tau] would be from h (left) to tau (right). Similarly, for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? Then the span [tail, head] is from tail (left) to head (right).\n\nBut in the given, we don't have any left-moving cars. All are right-moving. So we only have to handle right-moving.\n\nSo for right-moving: \n   The car at t1: [tail0, head0] (with tail0 <= head0) and at T: [tail0 + s*(T-62), head0 + s*(T-62)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T: if the player is at y = k (at turn T) and if 0 is in [tail0 + s*(T-62), head0 + s*(T-62)].\n\nSimilarly, for multiple cars on the same freeway: we have to check all.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tail0=-83, head0=-48, s=36, right.\n   Span at T: [ -83 + 36*(T-62), -48 + 36*(T-62) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: [ -83 + 36*(T-62), -48 + 36*(T-62) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway1: [ -83 + 36*(T-62), -48 + 36*(T-62) ]\n\nFreeway 4: tail0=-71, head0=-48, s=24, right.\n   Span: [ -71 + 24*(T-62), -48 + 24*(T-62) ]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway4: [ -71 + 24*(T-62), -48 + 24*(T-62) ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway4: [ -71 + 24*(T-62), -48 + 24*(T-62) ]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n   Car1: (head0=48, tail0=37, right, s=4) -> [37 + 4*(T-62), 48 + 4*(T-62)]\n   Car2: (head0=12, tail0=1, right, s=4) -> [1 + 4*(T-62), 12 + 4*(T-62)]\n   Car3: (head0=-24, tail0=-35, right, s=4) -> [-35 + 4*(T-62), -24 + 4*(T-62)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k (1 to 8) and at each turn T, whether the player being at k at turn T would cause a collision (i.e., if 0 is in any of the car spans on k at T).\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn 62 (T=62). We are safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. The minimal path would be to go up 9 times, so 9 turns: from T=62 to T=70, we would be at y=1 at T=63, y=2 at T=64, ... y=9 at T=71? \n\nWait: \n   Turn 62: y=0 (start)\n   Turn 63: after action at 62, we are at y=1? \n   Actually: \n        At turn t, we choose action a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\n   So at turn 62: we are at y=0. Then we choose an action at turn 62, and then at turn 63 we are at y1 = y0 + delta.\n\n   Therefore, we are at y=0 at turn 62, and then at turn 63 we are at y1, etc.\n\n   To be at y=9 at the last turn (say turn T), then we must have taken 9 up moves. But note we might have stayed or moved down in between, so the total turns might be more than 9.\n\n   The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we go straight up). So we try to see if we can go straight up without being hit.\n\n   We check for each freeway k (1 to 8) at turn T = 62 + k? \n\n   Specifically, we will be at:\n        Turn 62: y=0 (safe)\n        Turn 63: y=1 -> check freeway1 at T=63\n        Turn 64: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=64\n        ...\n        Turn 70: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=70\n        Turn 71: y=9 -> safe\n\n   So we need to check for k from 1 to 8, at T = 62 + k.\n\n   Let's check:\n\n   For freeway1 at T=63 (dt=1):\n        Car: [ -83 + 36*1, -48 + 36*1 ] = [ -47, -12] -> 0 is not in this interval? -> safe.\n\n   Freeway2 at T=64 (dt=2):\n        [ -83 + 36*2, -48 + 36*2 ] = [ -83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24 -> collision.\n\n   So at turn 64, if we are at freeway2, we collide.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot go straight up: we would be at freeway2 at turn 64 and collide.\n\n   We must avoid that. How?\n\n   We can either:\n      - Wait at some level to let the car pass? But note the cars are moving continuously and we are moving discretely.\n      - Or take a detour? But we can only move up and down and we are constrained by the grid.\n\n   Since we are at y=0 at turn62, and we need to get to y=9, we have to pass through each freeway at some turn.\n\n   We need to avoid being at freeway2 at turn64.\n\n   We might delay our arrival at freeway2. For example, we could stay at y=0 for one turn? Then:\n        Turn62: stay -> then at turn63, still at y=0? But no, if we stay at y=0, then at turn63 we are still at y=0? Then we haven't moved. But then we are at y=0 at turn63: safe.\n\n        Then at turn63: we can go up to y=1 at turn64? \n        Then at turn64: we are at freeway1? \n        Then we need to check freeway1 at T=64: \n             freeway1: [ -83+36*2, -48+36*2 ] = [-11,24] -> 0 in [-11,24] -> collision? \n             But wait, at T=64, we are at freeway1? Then we check freeway1 at T=64: yes, and 0 is in the span -> collision.\n\n        Alternatively, we might go up to y=1 at turn63 (as before) and then at turn63 we are at freeway1? Then we check freeway1 at T=63: we already did and it was safe. Then at turn64, we go up to y=2 -> then at turn64 we are at freeway2? Then we check freeway2 at T=64: collision.\n\n        So if we go up at turn62: then at turn63 we are at freeway1 (safe) and at turn64 we are at freeway2 (collision). \n\n        If we stay at turn62, then at turn63 we are still at y=0 (safe). Then at turn63 we go up: then at turn64 we are at y=1 (freeway1) at T=64 -> which we just saw is unsafe? Because freeway1 at T=64: [-11,24] includes 0 -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot be at freeway1 at T=64 either.\n\n   Alternatively, we might avoid freeway2 at T=64 by being there at a different time? \n\n   We need to check when freeway2 is safe.\n\n   For freeway2: same car as freeway1: \n        The car spans: [ -83 + 36*dt, -48 + 36*dt] \n        We require 0 not in [ -83+36*dt, -48+36*dt ]\n\n        Solve: \n            0 < -83+36*dt  OR  0 > -48+36*dt\n            => 36*dt < 83  OR  36*dt > 48\n            => dt < 83/36 ≈ 2.305  OR dt > 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\n        But note: the interval is inclusive? So 0 is in if -83+36*dt <= 0 <= -48+36*dt.\n\n        So we avoid when: -83+36*dt <= 0 <= -48+36*dt.\n\n        Rearranged: \n            -83+36*dt <= 0  => dt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n            and 0 <= -48+36*dt => 36*dt>=48 => dt>=48/36=4/3≈1.333\n\n        So collision when 1.333 <= dt <= 2.305.\n\n        Since dt is integer (turn count), then dt=2 (since 1.333<=2<=2.305) is the only integer in the interval? \n        dt=1: 1<1.333 -> safe? \n                dt=1: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        dt=2: [-11,24] -> unsafe.\n        dt=3: [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway2 is unsafe only at dt=2 (T=64) and safe at dt=1,3,4,...\n\n        Similarly, freeway1: same car, so same condition: unsafe at dt=2? \n            At freeway1 at dt=2: T=64 -> unsafe? \n            But at freeway1 at dt=1: T=63: safe.\n\n        Actually, freeway1 and freeway2 and freeway3 have the same car? But they are on different freeways. So the car on freeway1 is independent of the car on freeway2? Actually, the car on freeway1 is only on freeway1. So we have to check each freeway separately.\n\n        But the condition for freeway1: same as freeway2: unsafe at dt=2? \n            freeway1 at T=64 (dt=2): [-11,24] -> unsafe.\n\n        So we cannot be on freeway1 or freeway2 at T=64.\n\n        What about freeway3? same car: unsafe at dt=2? So we cannot be on freeway3 at T=64 either.\n\n        Therefore, at T=64, we must avoid freeways 1,2,3.\n\n        Similarly, freeway4,5,6: \n            Car: [ -71 +24*dt, -48+24*dt ]\n            Check for collision: 0 in [ -71+24*dt, -48+24*dt ]\n            => -71+24*dt <=0 and 0<= -48+24*dt\n            => 24*dt<=71 -> dt<=71/24≈2.958\n                and 24*dt>=48 -> dt>=2\n            So collision for dt in [2, 2.958] -> integer dt=2 and dt=3? \n            Let's check:\n                dt=2: [ -71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0] -> 0 is included? [ -23,0] includes 0 -> unsafe.\n                dt=3: [ -71+72, -48+72] = [1,24] -> safe? because 0 not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\n            Actually, at dt=2: [-23,0] -> 0 is the right endpoint? So if the interval is inclusive, then 0 is included -> unsafe.\n\n            dt=1: [ -71+24, -48+24] = [-47, -24] -> safe.\n            dt=3: safe.\n\n            So freeway4,5,6 are unsafe at dt=2 (T=64) and safe at other times.\n\n        Therefore, at T=64, all freeways 1-6 are unsafe? \n\n        Now freeway7 and 8 at T=64 (dt=2):\n\n        Freeway7 (and similarly freeway8) has three cars:\n\n          Car1: [37+4*2, 48+4*2] = [37+8,48+8] = [45,56] -> safe (0 not in)\n          Car2: [1+8,12+8] = [9,20] -> safe\n          Car3: [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16] -> safe\n\n        So freeway7 and 8 are safe at T=64.\n\n        Therefore, if we can be at freeway7 or 8 at T=64, we are safe. But we start at y=0. How can we get to freeway7 or 8 at T=64? \n\n        We are at y=0 at T=62 (dt=0). \n          At T=63: we can be at y=0 (if we stay) or y=1 (if we go up).\n          At T=64: \n             if we were at y=0 at T=63: then we can go up to y=1, or stay at 0, or even go down? but down from 0 is 0 (since y>=0).\n             if we were at y=1 at T=63: then at T=64 we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\n        We cannot get to freeway7 (y=7) or 8 (y=8) at T=64 because we can only move one step at a time.\n\n        The maximum we can be at T=64 is y=2 (if we go up twice: at turn62 and turn63).\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be at freeway7 or 8 at T=64.\n\n        And we cannot be at freeway1 to 6 at T=64 because they are all unsafe.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid being at any freeway (y in {1,2,...,8}) at T=64.\n\n        How? We can be at y=0 or y=9? But we are starting at y=0 and we are not at y=9 yet.\n\n        So we must be at y=0 at T=64? \n\n        How to be at y=0 at T=64?\n          At T=62: we start at y=0.\n          At T=63: we must stay at y=0 (so action at T=62: S) -> then at T=63 we are at y=0.\n          At T=64: we must stay at y=0 again? Then action at T=63: S -> then at T=64 we are at y=0.\n\n        Then we avoid freeways at T=64 because we are at y=0.\n\n        Then at T=64: we are at y=0. Now we can plan the next moves.\n\n        But note: we have to get to y=9 eventually.\n\n        We have already used 2 turns (T=62 and T=63) and we are still at y=0.\n\n        Now we need to check the future.\n\n        Let me make a timeline:\n\n          T=62: y=0 (start)\n          T=63: y=0 (by staying at T=62: action S)\n          T=64: y=0 (by staying at T=63: action S)\n\n          Now at T=64, we are at y=0. We want to go up.\n\n          We can then start moving up.\n\n          We want to know: when we are at freeway k at turn T, is it safe?\n\n          We'll compute the safety for each freeway for dt = T-62.\n\n          We already know that at dt=2 (T=64) we avoided the freeways by being at y=0.\n\n          Now we move:\n\n          T=64: we go up -> then at T=65: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=65 (dt=3)\n\n          Check freeway1 at dt=3: \n               [ -83 + 36*3, -48 + 36*3] = [ -83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> safe.\n\n          T=65: go up -> at T=66: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=66 (dt=4)\n          freeway2: [ -83+36*4, -48+36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96] -> safe.\n\n          T=66: go up -> at T=67: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=67 (dt=5)\n          freeway3: [ -83+36*5, -48+36*5] = [-83+180, -48+180] = [97,132] -> safe.\n\n          T=67: go up -> at T=68: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=68 (dt=6)\n          freeway4: [ -71 +24*6, -48+24*6] = [-71+144, -48+144] = [73,96] -> safe.\n\n          T=68: go up -> at T=69: y=5 -> freeway5 at T=69 (dt=7)\n          freeway5: same as freeway4: [ -71+24*7, -48+24*7] = [-71+168, -48+168] = [97,120] -> safe.\n\n          T=69: go up -> at T=70: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=70 (dt=8)\n          freeway6: [ -71+24*8, -48+24*8] = [-71+192, -48+192] = [121,144] -> safe.\n\n          T=70: go up -> at T=71: y=7 -> freeway7 at T=71 (dt=9)\n\n          Now check freeway7 at dt=9:\n             Car1: [37+4*9, 48+4*9] = [37+36,48+36] = [73,84] -> safe.\n             Car2: [1+36,12+36] = [37,48] -> safe.\n             Car3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe? 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          T=71: go up -> at T=72: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=72 (dt=10)\n          freeway8: same as freeway7? \n             Car1: [37+4*10,48+40] = [77,88] -> safe.\n             Car2: [1+40,12+40]=[41,52] -> safe.\n             Car3: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\n          T=72: go up -> at T=73: y=9 -> goal.\n\n          So total turns: from T=62 to T=73 -> 12 turns? But note we start at T=62 and we take actions at T=62, T=63, ... T=72? That is 11 actions? and then at T=73 we are at y=9.\n\n          How many actions? \n            T=62: S\n            T=63: S\n            T=64: U\n            T=65: U\n            T=66: U\n            T=67: U\n            T=68: U\n            T=69: U\n            T=70: U\n            T=71: U\n            T=72: U\n\n          That's 11 actions? But we started at T=62 and then we take 11 actions to get to T=73? \n          Actually, the last action is at T=72, and then at T=73 we are at y=9.\n\n          The problem: we need to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence. The sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, and then after H actions we are at the goal.\n\n          So H=11? \n\n          But is there a shorter path?\n\n          We had to wait two turns at the beginning. Can we avoid that?\n\n          Alternative: what if we go down? But we are at y=0, so we can't go below 0. So we can only stay or go up.\n\n          Another idea: can we be at a freeway that is safe at T=64? We saw that freeway7 and 8 are safe at T=64, but we can't get there by T=64.\n\n          What about being at freeway4 at a different time? For example, if we can get to freeway4 at dt=3 (T=65) which is safe? \n          But to get to freeway4 (y=4) at T=65: \n             We start at T=62: y=0.\n             We need to be at y=4 at T=65 -> that requires 4 up moves in 3 turns: \n                 T=62: go up -> T=63: y=1\n                 T=63: go up -> T=64: y=2\n                 T=64: go up -> T=65: y=3 -> not 4.\n\n          So we can only be at y=3 at T=65.\n\n          How about being at freeway7 at T=67? \n             To be at y=7 at T=67: we need 7 moves in 5 turns? \n                 T=62: U -> T=63:1\n                 T=63: U -> T=64:2\n                 T=64: U -> T=65:3\n                 T=65: U -> T=66:4\n                 T=66: U -> T=67:5 -> not 7.\n\n          We can only be at y=5 at T=67.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot skip the waiting.\n\n          But maybe we can wait in the middle? For example, we might get to y=1 at T=63 (safe) and then wait at y=1 at T=64? But at T=64, freeway1 is unsafe (as we saw) -> so if we are at y=1 at T=64, we collide.\n\n          Similarly, we cannot be at y=2 at T=64: freeway2 is unsafe.\n\n          Therefore, the only safe place at T=64 is y=0.\n\n          So we must be at y=0 at T=64.\n\n          Then we go up as fast as possible.\n\n          The above plan (with two waits at the beginning and then 9 up moves) takes 11 turns.\n\n          But note: after T=64, we go up 9 times without stopping. So total turns: 2 (waits) + 9 (up) = 11 actions.\n\n          However, we have to check if during the up moves we are safe at every freeway.\n\n          We already checked for freeway1 to freeway8 at the respective turns (with dt = T-62) and they were safe.\n\n          But note: when we are at freeway7 at T=71 (dt=9) and freeway8 at T=72 (dt=10), we checked the cars and they were safe.\n\n          Therefore, the plan:\n\n            Turn 62: S  (stay at y=0)\n            Turn 63: S  (stay at y=0)\n            Turn 64: U  (to y=1 at T=65)\n            Turn 65: U  (to y=2 at T=66)\n            Turn 66: U  (to y=3 at T=67)\n            Turn 67: U  (to y=4 at T=68)\n            Turn 68: U  (to y=5 at T=69)\n            Turn 69: U  (to y=6 at T=70)\n            Turn 70: U  (to y=7 at T=71)\n            Turn 71: U  (to y=8 at T=72)\n            Turn 72: U  (to y=9 at T=73)\n\n          But note: we are at y=9 at T=73, which is the goal. The last action is at T=72.\n\n          Is there a way to do it in fewer turns? \n\n          We must avoid T=64 on freeways 1-8. We did that by waiting two turns. But could we wait only one turn? \n\n          Suppose we wait one turn at the beginning:\n\n            T=62: S -> T=63: y=0 (safe)\n            T=63: we must choose an action. If we go up, then at T=64: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=64 -> unsafe (because freeway1 at dt=2: unsafe).\n\n          If we stay again at T=63? Then we are at y=0 at T=64 -> safe. That is the same as above.\n\n          Alternatively, at T=63: we could go down? But we are at y=0, so down stays at 0 -> same as stay.\n\n          So we must have at least two waits? \n\n          Then 11 turns is minimal? \n\n          But note: we are going up 9 times and we have 2 waits, so total 11 actions.\n\n          However, we might be able to avoid waiting two consecutive times at the beginning by waiting later? \n\n          For example, suppose we go up to y=1 at T=63 (safe, as we saw for freeway1 at dt=1). Then at T=63: we are at y=1. Now we must avoid being at y=1 at T=64? Because freeway1 at T=64 is unsafe. So at T=63: we have to leave freeway1? How? We can go down to y=0 at T=64? \n\n          Then:\n            T=62: U -> T=63: y=1 (safe) \n            T=63: D -> T=64: y=0 (safe)\n\n          Then at T=64: we are at y=0. Then we can start going up.\n\n          Then the timeline:\n\n            T=62: U -> y=1 at T=63 (safe: freeway1 at dt=1: [-47,-12] safe)\n            T=63: D -> y=0 at T=64 (safe: at freeway? no, y=0)\n            T=64: U -> y=1 at T=65 (freeway1 at dt=3: [25,60] safe)\n            T=65: U -> y=2 at T=66 (freeway2 at dt=4: [61,96] safe)\n            T=66: U -> y=3 at T=67 (freeway3 at dt=5: [97,132] safe)\n            T=67: U -> y=4 at T=68 (freeway4 at dt=6: [73,96] safe)\n            T=68: U -> y=5 at T=69 (freeway5 at dt=7: [97,120] safe)\n            T=69: U -> y=6 at T=70 (freeway6 at dt=8: [121,144] safe)\n            T=70: U -> y=7 at T=71 (freeway7 at dt=9: safe as above)\n            T=71: U -> y=8 at T=72 (freeway8 at dt=10: safe)\n            T=72: U -> y=9 at T=73\n\n          This is also 11 actions? \n\n          But note: we did an extra move: we went up and then down. That's two moves to essentially wait one turn? \n\n          However, we still end at T=73. \n\n          Actually, we did:\n            T=62: U -> then at T=63 we are at y=1.\n            T=63: D -> then at T=64 we are at y=0.\n            Then we have to go up again to y=1 at T=65.\n\n          So we spent two moves to be at y=0 at T=64 and then we are at the same state as the previous plan at T=64: y=0.\n\n          Then the rest is the same. So total actions: 11.\n\n          But in the first plan we did two S's and then 9 U's: 11 actions.\n          In this plan: we did U, D, and then 9 U's? Actually, from T=64: we go up 9 times? But we start at y=0 at T=64, so we need 9 up moves to get to y=9 at T=73: \n                T=64: U -> T=65: y=1\n                T=65: U -> T=66: y=2\n                ... \n                T=72: U -> T=73: y=9\n\n          So the actions: \n                T=62: U\n                T=63: D\n                T=64: U\n                T=65: U\n                ... until T=72: U (total 10 actions? but we have 11: T=62 to T=72 is 11 actions)\n\n          Actually, the sequence of actions: \n                Turn t1 (62): U\n                Turn 63: D\n                Turn 64: U\n                Turn 65: U\n                Turn 66: U\n                Turn 67: U\n                Turn 68: U\n                Turn 69: U\n                Turn 70: U\n                Turn 71: U\n                Turn 72: U\n\n          That's 11 actions.\n\n          But note: the goal is reached at T=73, which is after 11 actions.\n\n          Can we do it in 10? \n\n          We must avoid being at any freeway at T=64. \n\n          The only safe y at T=64 is y=0. \n\n          How to be at y=0 at T=64? \n             We start at y=0 at T=62.\n             We can only move one step per turn. \n                 T=62: we choose an action -> T=63: y can be 0 or 1.\n                 T=63: we choose an action -> T=64: if at T=63 we were at y=0: then we can be at 0 or 1 at T=64.\n                         if at T=63 we were at y=1: then we can be at 0,1,2 at T=64.\n\n          To be at y=0 at T=64, we must have:\n             Option 1: \n                 T=62: S -> T=63: y=0\n                 T=63: S -> T=64: y=0\n\n             Option 2:\n                 T=62: U -> T=63: y=1\n                 T=63: D -> T=64: y=0\n\n          Both require two actions. Then we are at y=0 at T=64.\n\n          Then we have to go from y=0 to y=9: that requires 9 up moves. \n\n          So total actions: 2 (to get to y=0 at T=64) + 9 (to get to y=9 at T=73) = 11.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 11.\n\n          Now, which sequence? We can choose either:\n\n            Plan A: \n                Turn 62: S\n                Turn 63: S\n                Turn 64: U\n                Turn 65: U\n                Turn 66: U\n                Turn 67: U\n                Turn 68: U\n                Turn 69: U\n                Turn 70: U\n                Turn 71: U\n                Turn 72: U\n\n            or Plan B:\n                Turn 62: U\n                Turn 63: D\n                Turn 64: U\n                Turn 65: U\n                ... same as above.\n\n          Both are 11 actions. We can choose either.\n\n          But note: in Plan B, we go up then down. That might be less efficient in terms of energy? But the problem only minimizes the number of turns (H). So both are minimal.\n\n          We can choose Plan A to avoid unnecessary movement.\n\n          However, we must check if there is any issue in the middle? \n\n          In Plan A, we are at y=0 for two turns. Then we go up. We already checked the freeways for the up moves.\n\n          In Plan B, we are at y=1 at T=63: which we checked (freeway1 at dt=1: safe). Then we go down to y=0 at T=64: safe. Then we go up.\n\n          So both are safe.\n\n          Let me write Plan A.\n\n          But note: the answer format:\n\n          \\boxed{\n          Turn 62: S\n          Turn 63: S\n          Turn 64: U\n          Turn 65: U\n          Turn 66: U\n          Turn 67: U\n          Turn 68: U\n          Turn 69: U\n          Turn 70: U\n          Turn 71: U\n          Turn 72: U\n          }\n\n          But wait, at Turn 72: we are at y=8? Then we go up to y=9 at the next state? Then we are done. The last action is at Turn 72.\n\n          The problem: the sequence is from t = t1 to t1+H-1, so H=11. The actions are at turns 62 to 72 (inclusive) -> 11 turns.\n\n          We output the actions for each turn starting at t1=62.\n\n          However, note that we have 11 actions: from t62 to t72.\n\n          But the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. So t from 0 to 10 (if H=11) -> that's 11 actions.\n\n          So this is correct.\n\n          But wait: in the initial state, the player is at (0,0) at turn t1=62. Then we take the first action at turn 62.\n\n          We have to output the actions for turn 62, 63, ..., 72.\n\n          So the answer:\n\n          Turn 62: S\n          Turn 63: S\n          Turn 64: U\n          Turn 65: U\n          Turn 66: U\n          Turn 67: U\n          Turn 68: U\n          Turn 69: U\n          Turn 70: U\n          Turn 71: U\n          Turn 72: U\n\n          This gets to y=9 at turn 73.\n\n          We assume that after the last action (at turn72) we are at y=9 and the game ends.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence. So after the last action, the position is (0,9).\n\n          How do we check? \n            After the action at turn72: \n                The update: y_{73} = y_{72} + delta\n                We are at y_{72} = 8 (because we were at y=8 at turn72, then we do U -> y=9 at turn73).\n\n          So we are at (0,9) at turn73, which is after the last action. But the problem says \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" meaning that at the state after the last action we are at (0,9).\n\n          Therefore, this is correct.\n\n          But note: we must be sure that we are not required to be at (0,9) during the sequence? The goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence.\n\n          So we are done.\n\n          However, let me double-check freeway7 and freeway8 at the times we pass them.\n\n          In Plan A:\n            We are at freeway7 at T=71 (dt=9): \n                Car1: [37+4*9,48+36] = [37+36,48+36] = [73,84] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n                Car2: [1+36,12+36] = [37,48] -> safe.\n                Car3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n            Freeway8 at T=72 (dt=10):\n                Car1: [37+40,48+40]=[77,88] -> safe.\n                Car2: [1+40,12+40]=[41,52] -> safe.\n                Car3: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\n          And the other freeways we passed earlier with dt>=3 and <=8 were safe.\n\n          Therefore, the plan is safe.\n\n          We output the sequence.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=11. Is there a plan with H=10? \n\n          We argued that we must be at y=0 at T=64, which requires two actions (from T=62 to T=63 and T=63 to T=64) and then we need 9 up moves -> 11 actions. \n\n          So no, we cannot do it in 10.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n          We choose Plan A.\n\n          However, note that in the initial state, the player is at (0,0). We have two options for the first two moves: \n             Option 1: S, S\n             Option 2: U, D\n\n          Both lead to y=0 at T=64. Then the rest is the same.\n\n          We choose Option 1 (S,S) for simplicity.\n\n          So the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: S\nTurn 63: S\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 11 lines. The problem says: from t=0 to H-1, and H=11, so t from 0 to 10, which corresponds to turn62 to turn72.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 62\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 62, staying at \\(y = 0\\) (action S) avoids any freeway and is safe.\n- At turn 63, staying at \\(y = 0\\) (action S) again avoids freeways and is safe, and ensures the player is not on any freeway at turn 64, when all freeways 1 to 6 are unsafe due to car collisions.\n- From turn 64 to turn 72, moving up (action U) each turn moves the player from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 9 steps. The freeway checks at the respective turns confirm safety:\n  - Freeway 1 at turn 65 (\\(dt = 3\\)): car span \\([25, 60]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 2 at turn 66 (\\(dt = 4\\)): car span \\([61, 96]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 3 at turn 67 (\\(dt = 5\\)): car span \\([97, 132]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 4 at turn 68 (\\(dt = 6\\)): car span \\([73, 96]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 5 at turn 69 (\\(dt = 7\\)): car span \\([97, 120]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 6 at turn 70 (\\(dt = 8\\)): car span \\([121, 144]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Freeway 7 at turn 71 (\\(dt = 9\\)): cars spans \\([73, 84]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in any span.\n  - Freeway 8 at turn 72 (\\(dt = 10\\)): cars spans \\([77, 88]\\), \\([41, 52]\\), \\([5, 16]\\), 0 not in any span.\n\nAfter the action at turn 72, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 73, which is not a freeway and thus safe. This sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns, as any path with fewer than 11 turns would require being on a freeway at turn 64 (which is unsafe) or cannot cover the distance from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in fewer than 9 up moves, and the two initial stays are necessary to avoid turn 64 collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: S\nTurn 63: S\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 64, and I start at y=0. I need to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 64.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn and how they move. The cars move left or right with constant speed, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway y at turn T, the position x=0 is not covered by any car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position updates based on the action: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 64. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so I need to pass through each of these without being hit by a car when I'm on that row.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since there are no cars there. The cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t1=64.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so head is the front, I think. From the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving cars: at turn t1, span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, I suppose, with tail at left, head at right, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] with h at left, τ at right, moving left.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince moving left, decreasing x.\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIncreasing x.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, when I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T when I take the action, and I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe position update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, I am at (0, y_t), I choose action a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nSo, at turn t, I am on row y_t.\n\nCollision at turn T if for the freeway k = y_T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf I move, at turn T, when I take action to go to y_{T+1}, at that moment, I am on y_T, so I check collision for freeway y_T at turn T. Then after the move, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I check for freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=0 at turn 64, and y=0 has no cars, so at turn 64, no collision possible. Then I need to go to y=1 or stay, but I need to reach y=9, so I should go up.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 has no cars, so once I reach, it's fine.\n\nNow, freeways 1 to 8 have cars.\n\nLet me list for each freeway, the cars and their positions at turn t1=64.\n\nt1=64.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h = -48, tail τ = -83, direction right, speed s=36.\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-83, -48], moving right.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-83 + 36(T-64), -48 + 36(T-64)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (-48,-83,right,36), same as k=1.\n\nk=1: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nk=2: (-48,-83,right,36) same.\n\nk=3: (-48,-83,right,36) same.\n\nk=4: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nk=5: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nk=6: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nk=7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nk=8: same as k=7: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFor freeways 1,2,3, each has one car with s=36, span [-83,-48] at t1.\n\nSince s=36, and moving right, the car is long: length is |h - τ| = |-48 - (-83)| = 35 units? From -83 to -48 is 35 units wide.\n\nSimilarly for k=4,5,6: h=-48, τ=-71, so span [-71,-48]? Let's see: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-71, -48], since τ is tail, h is head, I think.\n\nIn the notation, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nBut here all cars are right-moving, I think, since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nk=7 and k=8 have multiple cars.\n\nFirst, for a single freeway, collision at turn T if 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at T.\n\nFor freeway 1,2,3: car span at T: [ -83 + 36(T-64) , -48 + 36(T-64) ]\n\nSet 0 in this interval:\n\n-83 + 36(T-64) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36(T-64)\n\nSimilarly for k=4,5,6: car span [ -71 + 24(T-64) , -48 + 24(T-64) ]\n\nFor k=7 and k=8, multiple cars.\n\nk=7: three cars:\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=4. Span at t1: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 4(T-64), 48 + 4(T-64)]\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, right, s=4. Span [1,12] at t1, at T: [1 + 4(T-64), 12 + 4(T-64)]\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=4. Span [-35,-24] at t1, at T: [-35 + 4(T-64), -24 + 4(T-64)]\n\nSimilarly for k=8, same cars.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is covered for each freeway.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen, for me to be on that freeway at turn T, it must not be unsafe at that T.\n\nI start at y=0 at t=64, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, with possible up, down, stay, the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9 turns: all U, from t=64 to t=72, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to wait or detour, so H might be more.\n\nI need to avoid the unsafe times for each row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the set of turns when it is unsafe.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t1 = T - 64, so relative time.\n\nFor freeway y=1: car span at T: [ -83 + 36Δt , -48 + 36Δt ] where Δt = T-64\n\n0 in [ -83 + 36Δt , -48 + 36Δt ] if:\n\n-83 + 36Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 36Δt\n\nSo 36Δt ≤ 83 and 36Δt ≥ 48? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-83 + 36Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 36Δt ≤ 83 ⇒ Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.3055\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 36Δt ⇒ 36Δt ≥ 48 ⇒ Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.3333\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe when 1.3333 ≤ Δt ≤ 2.3055, so since turn integer, Δt from ceil(1.3333) to floor(2.3055), i.e., Δt=2? Let's see:\n\nΔt must be integer, T integer.\n\nΔt ≥ ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, ceil(1.333)=2? No.\n\nΔt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since Δt integer, Δt ≥ 2? No:\n\nΔt must satisfy 36Δt ≥ 48, so Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so smallest integer Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, 36Δt ≤ 83, Δt ≤ 83/36≈2.305, so Δt ≤ 2 since 2.305 floor is 2.\n\nΔt ≤ 2.305, so Δt <=2.\n\nAnd Δt >=2 from above.\n\nSo Δt=2 exactly.\n\nFor Δt=2: lower bound: -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n\nUpper bound: -48 + 72 = 24\n\nSo [ -11, 24 ] at T=66, and 0 is in [-11,24], yes.\n\nFor Δt=1: lower: -83 + 36*1 = -83+36= -47\n\nUpper: -48+36= -12\n\nSo [ -47, -12 ], 0 not in, since -47 to -12, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nFor Δt=3: lower: -83 + 36*3 = -83 + 108 = 25\n\nUpper: -48 + 108 = 60\n\n[25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe only at Δt=2, i.e., T=66.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2 and y=3, same cars, so same unsafe times, only at T=66.\n\nNow y=4: cars with s=24, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-71, -48] since h=-48, τ=-71.\n\nAt T: [ -71 + 24Δt , -48 + 24Δt ]\n\n0 in [ -71 + 24Δt , -48 + 24Δt ] if:\n\n-71 + 24Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 24Δt\n\nSo 24Δt ≤ 71 ⇒ Δt ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.9583\n\nAnd 24Δt ≥ 48 ⇒ Δt ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSo Δt ≥ 2 and Δt ≤ 2.9583, so integer Δt=2 or Δt=3?\n\nΔt=2: lower: -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23\n\nUpper: -48 + 48 = 0\n\n[ -23, 0 ], and 0 is included? 0 ≤ 0 is true, so yes, 0 in [ -23, 0 ].\n\nSimilarly, Δt=3: lower: -71 + 24*3 = -71 + 72 =1\n\nUpper: -48 + 72 =24\n\n[1,24], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nΔt=1: lower: -71+24= -47, upper: -48+24= -24, [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=4, unsafe at Δt=2, T=66.\n\nNow y=5 and y=6 same as y=4, unsafe only at T=66.\n\nNow y=7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: at T: [37 + 4Δt, 48 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in this if 37 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 4Δt\n\nBut 37 + 4Δt ≥ 37 >0 for Δt≥0, so 0 ≤ ... is true only if left ≤0, but left is min 37>0, so never ≤0, thus 0 never in this interval since both ends positive for all Δt.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in this if 1 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 4Δt\n\n1 + 4Δt ≥1 >0 for Δt≥0, so left >0, never ≤0, thus 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-35 + 4Δt, -24 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in this if -35 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 4Δt\n\nWhich is 4Δt ≤ 35 and 4Δt ≥ 24\n\nΔt ≤ 35/4 = 8.75\n\nΔt ≥ 24/4 = 6\n\nSo for Δt=6,7,8\n\nAt Δt=6: lower: -35 + 24 = -11?

No, I can go up and down, so I might visit a row multiple times or skip, but I can only change by -1,0,1 each turn, so to go from 0 to 9, I must pass through each integer y from 0 to 9, but since I start at 0 and end at 9, and move step by step, the y values I visit are consecutive, but I might stay on a row or go back, but to minimize turns, I probably want to go directly up with no down or stay, except to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince I need to reach 9, and H min is 9, but with obstacles.\n\nAt T=64, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=1 at some point.\n\ny=1 is unsafe only at T=66, so I can be on y=1 at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe unsafe times are all concentrated at T=66 for y=1-6, and T=70-72 for y=7-8.\n\nSpecifically, y=1 to 6 are all unsafe only at T=66, and safe at other times.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at T=70,71,72.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9, avoiding being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nSince I start at T=64, y=0.\n\nIf I go up immediately, at T=65, I can be on y=1.\n\nT=65: what is the state?\n\ny=1 at T=65: is it unsafe? y=1 unsafe only at T=66, so at T=65, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at T=65: also safe, since unsafe only T=66.\n\nBut I need to go step by step.\n\nAt T=64, y=0, I choose action.\n\nI can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U at T=64, then at T=65, y=1.\n\nAt T=65, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen I can choose to go up again to y=2 at T=66.\n\nBut at T=66, y=2 is unsafe, since y=2 unsafe at T=66.\n\nIf I am on y=2 at T=66, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on y=1 at T=66, y=1 unsafe at T=66, collision.\n\nIf I go down, to y=0, but y=0 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=1 to 6 are all unsafe at T=66, if I am on any of them at T=66, I get hit.\n\nSo I must not be on y=1 to 6 at T=66.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 and 8, I must not be on them at T=70,71,72.\n\nNow, at T=64, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to delay or something.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, H=9, arrive at y=9 at T=73?

Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, so actions at t=64,65,66,..., up to t=64 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t=64 + H, I am at position.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at turn t=64, y=0.\n\nI take action a_{64}, then at t=65, y_{65} = y_{64} + Δy_{64}\n\nThen at t=65, I take a_{65}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t} for some t to be 9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is the turn after the last action.\n\nDefine: after H actions, at turn t=64 + H, I am at y_{64+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=64 to t=64 + H -1.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning number of actions taken.\n\nIn the output, we list actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nNow, without cars, min H=9, actions all U at t=64 to 72, then at t=73, y=9.\n\nt=64: action U, t=65 y=1\n\nt=65 U, t=66 y=2\n\nt=66 U, t=67 y=3\n\n...\n\nt=72 U, t=73 y=9.\n\nBut with cars, at t=66, if I am on y=2, unsafe.\n\nIn this path, at t=66, y=2, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I start later, but I need to minimize H.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for some turns or go down, but y=0 is safe.\n\nSince y=1-6 are unsafe only at t=66, I can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=1 at t=65, which is safe.\n\nBut at t=66, I need to not be on y=1-6.\n\nSo at t=66, I must be on y=0 or y=7 or above, but y=7 at t=66? y=7 is safe at t=66, since unsafe only at 70,71,72.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at t=66.\n\nBut I start from low, so at t=66, I cannot be on high rows yet.\n\nAt t=64, I am y=0.\n\nt=64 action: I can choose S, stay at y=0 for t=65.\n\nOr U to y=1 at t=65.\n\nIf I go U at t=64, to y=1 at t=65.\n\nThen at t=65, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nNow at t=65, I need to choose action: if I go U, to y=2 at t=66, but t=66 y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=0 at t=66, safe.\n\nIf S, stay y=1 at t=66, unsafe.\n\nSo only safe is to go down to y=0 at t=66.\n\nThen at t=66, y=0, safe.\n\nBut now I am back at start, wasted moves.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for t=65 and t=66.\n\nLet's think about timing.\n\nThe critical point is to avoid being on y=1-6 at t=66.\n\nSimilarly, later avoid y=7-8 at t=70,71,72.\n\nNow, I need to be on each row from 1 to 8 at some safe time.\n\ny=1 can be visited at t=65, or after t=66, but after t=66 is safe for y=1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=1 is t=65.\n\nAt t=65, y=1 safe.\n\nThen I need to go up, but at t=66, I cannot be on y=1-6.\n\nSo I must be on y=0 or y=7+ at t=66.\n\nBut y=7 at t=66 is possible only if I jump, but I can only move one step, so from y=1 at t=65, at t=66 I can be y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 or 2, but y=2 unsafe, so only y=0 or y=1 but y=1 unsafe, so only y=0 is safe at t=66 from here.\n\nSo I have to go down to y=0.\n\nThen I am back.\n\nI could stay at y=0 until after t=66.\n\nFor example, at t=64, I choose S, stay at y=0 for t=65.\n\nAt t=65, y=0, safe.\n\nAt t=65, I can choose to go U to y=1 at t=66, but t=66 y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr stay S, y=0 at t=66, safe.\n\nOr D, but y=-1 invalid, cannot, y min 0.\n\nSo at t=65, if I go U, to y=1 at t=66, unsafe.\n\nIf S, to y=0 at t=66, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=64, if I go S, to y=0 at t=65, then at t=65 I can go S again to y=0 at t=66.\n\nThen at t=66, y=0, safe.\n\nNow after t=66, I can start moving up.\n\nAt t=66, y=0.\n\nI take action at t=66, can go U to y=1 at t=67.\n\nNow t=67, y=1, is it safe? y=1 unsafe only at t=66, so at t=67, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=67 safe, etc.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nBut later I have problem with y=7 and 8 at t=70-72.\n\nFirst, let's go up as fast as possible after t=66.\n\nStart from t=66, y=0.\n\nt=66 action U, to y=1 at t=67.\n\nt=67 action U, to y=2 at t=68.\n\nt=68 U, to y=3 at t=69.\n\nt=69 U, to y=4 at t=70.\n\nNow t=70, y=4.\n\ny=4 is safe? y=4 unsafe only at t=66, so at t=70, safe.\n\nNow I need to go to y=5,6,7,etc.\n\nBut at t=70, I am at y=4.\n\nIf I go U, to y=5 at t=71.\n\nt=71, y=5, safe since unsafe only t=66.\n\nThen t=71 U, to y=6 at t=72.\n\nt=72 y=6, safe.\n\nThen t=72 U, to y=7 at t=73.\n\nt=73 y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at t=70,71,72, but at t=73, is it safe?\n\ny=7 unsafe at Δt=6,7,8 which is T=70,71,72.\n\nAt T=73, Δt=9, which is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at T=70,71,72, safe at T=73.\n\nNow, at t=73, I am at y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=8 at t=74, then to y=9 at t=75.\n\nt=73 action U, to y=8 at t=74.\n\nt=74 action U, to y=9 at t=75.\n\nSo I reach y=9 at t=75.\n\nNow, what about actions: from t=64 to t=74, let's list.\n\nt=64: I stayed or something? In this path, I was at y=0 until t=66.\n\nAt t=64: I need to specify action.\n\nIn this sequence: at t=64, I am y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at t=66.\n\nSo, at t=64, I can choose S, to stay at y=0 for t=65.\n\nAt t=65, I choose S, to stay at y=0 for t=66.\n\nAt t=66, I choose U, to go to y=1 at t=67.\n\nThen:\n\nt=67: U, to y=2 at t=68\n\nt=68: U, to y=3 at t=69\n\nt=69: U, to y=4 at t=70\n\nt=70: U, to y=5 at t=71\n\nt=71: U, to y=6 at t=72\n\nt=72: U, to y=7 at t=73\n\nt=73: U, to y=8 at t=74\n\nt=74: U, to y=9 at t=75\n\nNow, at t=72, I am going to y=7 at t=73, which is safe.\n\nBut at t=72, where am I? At t=72, I am at y=6, since I go U at t=72 to y=7 at t=73.\n\ny=6 at t=72: is it safe? y=6 unsafe only at t=66, so at t=72, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, I reach y=9 at t=75, so H=11 actions? Let's count the actions.\n\nActions from t=64 to t=74 inclusive.\n\nt=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74: that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at t=75, y=9.\n\nBut min possible is 9, here H=11.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nFor example, if I start moving earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=64, I go U to y=1 at t=65.\n\nThen at t=65, y=1 safe.\n\nNow, at t=65, I cannot go U to y=2 at t=66 because unsafe.\n\nI could go down to y=0 at t=66, but that wastes a move.\n\nAt t=65, I could stay, but if I stay at t=65, S, then at t=66 y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I must go down to y=0 at t=66.\n\nThen at t=66, y=0, same as before, then I go up from t=67, same as above, but I used an extra move: t=64 U, t=65 D? Let's see.\n\nt=64: U, to y=1 at t=65\n\nt=65: D, to y=0 at t=66? But D from y=1 to y=0.\n\nThen at t=66, y=0.\n\nThen same as before: t=66 U to y=1 at t=67, etc.\n\nBut in this case, I have two actions: U and D, back to start, so I wasted two actions compared to staying.\n\nIn the first path, I stayed at y=0 for two turns: t=64 S, t=65 S, to be at y=0 at t=66.\n\nHere, I did t=64 U, t=65 D, to be at y=0 at t=66, same position but used two actions instead of two S, but S is also an action, so same number: in both cases, from t=64 to t=66, I use two actions to be at y=0 at t=66.\n\nThen proceed the same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nCan I reach higher rows before t=66?\n\nFor example, if I go up multiple times, but I can only go one step per turn.\n\nAt t=64, y=0, go U to y=1 at t=65.\n\nThen at t=65, I can only be at y=0,1,2, but y=1 and 2 unsafe at t=66, so only y=0 safe, so I must go to y=0 at t=66.\n\nNo way to be at y=7 at t=66 from start.\n\nSo I think I have to be below y=7 until after t=66.\n\nNow, after t=66, I can go up fast.\n\nIn the path above, I go from y=0 at t=66 to y=7 at t=73, that takes 7 turns: t=67 y=1, t=68 y=2, ..., t=73 y=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=74, y=9 at t=75.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are unsafe at t=70,71,72, which I avoided since I am there at t=73 and 74.\n\nt=73 y=7, t=74 y=8, both safe.\n\nBut can I arrive earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 earlier than t=73.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at t=70,71,72, so I cannot be on y=7 at those times.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=7 is t=73, after the unsafe period.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=7 at t=73, which is the first safe time.\n\nNow, from start, I was at y=0 until t=66, which is turn 3? t=64,65,66: three turns at y=0, but actions: t=64 and t=65 I did S or something to stay, but I need actions to move.\n\nIn terms of progress, I need to cover 9 rows.\n\nThe delay is caused by the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe at t=66 forces me to be below y=1 until after t=66, so I start moving up at t=67 from y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 actions from there, but from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, so from t=67 to t=75? Let's see.\n\nAt t=66, after action? At t=66, I am at y=0 (after previous actions).\n\nTake action at t=66: U, to y=1 at t=67.\n\nThen t=67: U, to y=2 at t=68\n\n...\n\nUp to t=74: U, to y=9 at t=75? From t=67 to t=75: that's 9 turns, y from 1 to 9? t=67 y=1, t=68 y=2, ..., t=75 y=9? t=75 y=9, but actions up to t=74.\n\nStart: at t=66, y=0.\n\nAction t=66: U, t=67 y=1\n\nAction t=67: U, t=68 y=2\n\n...\n\nAction t=74: U, t=75 y=9\n\nSo actions from t=66 to t=74, that's 9 actions, to reach at t=75.\n\nBut I need to include from t=64.\n\nAt t=64 and t=65, I need to be at y=0.\n\nSo actions: t=64: S (stay at y=0 for t=65)\n\nt=65: S (stay at y=0 for t=66)\n\nThen t=66: U to y=1 at t=67\n\nt=67: U to y=2 at t=68\n\n...\n\nt=74: U to y=9 at t=75? t=74 action U, from y=8? Let's list y_t.\n\nAt t=66, after action? Better to list the state.\n\nTurn t | Action a_t | Position y_{t+1} after action? Or y_t at turn t.\n\nDefine: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt t=64, y_64 = 0\n\nI take a_64: if S, then y_65 = 0\n\nThen a_65: S, y_66 = 0\n\nThen a_66: U, y_67 = 1\n\na_67: U, y_68 = 2\n\na_68: U, y_69 = 3\n\na_69: U, y_70 = 4\n\na_70: U, y_71 = 5\n\na_71: U, y_72 = 6\n\na_72: U, y_73 = 7\n\na_73: U, y_74 = 8\n\na_74: U, y_75 = 9\n\nSo actions from t=64 to t=74, 11 actions, reach y=9 at t=75.\n\nBut at t=72, y_72 = 6, which is safe.\n\nt=73 y_73=7, safe.\n\nNow, but I have y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=70,71,72, but I am not on them then.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=6 at t=72, which is safe.\n\ny=6 at t=72: safe, since unsafe only t=66.\n\nThen at t=73, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut can I be on y=7 earlier?\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=7 is t=67? But let's see the time.\n\nFrom t=66, y=0, I need at least 7 actions to reach y=7: t=66 U to y1 t67, t67 U to y2 t68, ..., t72 U to y7 t73.\n\nSo y=7 at t=73 is the earliest possible after t=66.\n\nSimilarly, since y=7 unsafe before t=73 except at t=73 it is safe.\n\nt=70,71,72 unsafe, so t=73 is first safe.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not staying at y=0.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=64, I go U to y=1 at t=65.\n\nThen at t=65, instead of going down, I go up, but I cannot because at t=66 y=2 unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on a safe row at t=66.\n\nBut the only safe rows at t=66 are y=0,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7,8,9 I cannot reach from y=1 in one step.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 at t=66, but from y=0 at t=64, I need to go to y=7 in two steps? Impossible, max one per turn.\n\nSo no, I must be on low rows at t=66 or y=0.\n\nSo I think staying at y=0 until t=66 is necessary, or equivalent.\n\nNow, about the later part, y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=70,71,72.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=4 at t=70, y=5 at t=71, y=6 at t=72, all safe, then y=7 at t=73 safe.\n\nBut at t=72, y=6, I could go directly to y=7 if possible, but y=7 unsafe at t=72, so I cannot.\n\nIn the action at t=72, I go U to y=7 at t=73, which is after the unsafe time.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 earlier? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or advance the movement to avoid the unsafe times differently.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are unsafe from t=70 to 72, I need to be on them before or after.\n\nBefore: but before t=70, y=7 is safe, for example at t=69.\n\nt=69: y=7, is it safe? y=7 unsafe at Δt=6,7,8, T=70,71,72, so at t=69, Δt=5, T=69, which is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, t=68, etc.\n\nSo I could be on y=7 at t=69, for example.\n\nThen I need to leave before t=70.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut I need to be on each row only once? Not necessarily, I can visit multiple times.\n\nTo minimize H, probably not.\n\nFor example, I could go up to y=7 before t=70, then when unsafe, I go down or stay on safe row, but y=7 unsafe, so I must not be on it during unsafe times.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at t=69, safe.\n\nThen at t=69, if I stay, at t=70 y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I must move away at t=69 action.\n\nI can go down to y=6 or up to y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=70: but y=8 unsafe at t=70, so if I go up to y=8 at t=70, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=6 at t=70, y=6 is safe at t=70, since unsafe only t=66.\n\nBut then I have to come back later.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see if I can save time.\n\nFirst, from start.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at t=66 to avoid the unsafe.\n\nAt t=64 and t=65, I stay at y=0 or move but return.\n\nAssume I stay at y=0 for t=65 and t=66 by taking S at t=64 and t=65.\n\nThen at t=66, y=0.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nThe unsafe times for y=7-8 are t=70,71,72.\n\nI need to be on y=7 before t=70 or after t=72.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=7 is, from y=0 at t=66.\n\nt=66 U to y1 t67\n\nt67 U to y2 t68\n\nt68 U to y3 t69\n\nt69 U to y4 t70? Let's list:\n\nt=66 action U, y67=1\n\nt67 U, y68=2\n\nt68 U, y69=3\n\nt69 U, y70=4\n\nAt t=70, y=4.\n\nI can go to y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, from t=69 y=3, if I go U to y=4 at t=70.\n\nBut I can be on y=7 at t=69? How?\n\nFrom y=0 at t=66, to y=7 at t=73, as before.\n\nAt t=69, I am at y=3 if I go up each step.\n\nt=66 U, t67 y1\n\nt67 U, t68 y2\n\nt68 U, t69 y3\n\nThen at t=69, I can go U to y=4 at t=70.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=69, I need to have been higher earlier, but I started low.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 before t=70 except if I was higher, but I wasn't.\n\nThe first time I can be on y=7 is t=73 in this sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher rows by not going step by step, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nSo I think t=73 is the earliest for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, then to y=9 at t=75.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions:\n\nt=64: S (to stay at y=0 for t=65)\n\nt=65: S (to stay at y=0 for t=66)\n\nt=66: U (to y=1 at t=67)\n\nt=67: U (to y=2 at t=68)\n\nt=68: U (to y=3 at t=69)\n\nt=69: U (to y=4 at t=70)\n\nt=70: U (to y=5 at t=71)\n\nt=71: U (to y=6 at t=72)\n\nt=72: U (to y=7 at t=73)\n\nt=73: U (to y=8 at t=74)\n\nt=74: U (to y=9 at t=75)\n\nNow, at t=70, y=5? t=70 position y_70=4, action U, y_71=5\n\nt=71 action U, y_72=6\n\nt=72 action U, y_73=7\n\ny_73=7 at t=73, which is safe.\n\nBut at t=70, I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nt=71 y=5, safe.\n\nt=72 y=6, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nCan I reduce?\n\nFor example, at t=69, instead of going to y=4 at t=70, I could do something else, but I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=7 after the unsafe period, but I have to pass through lower rows.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are unsafe only at specific times, I could be on them before, then move away during unsafe times, then come back.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up fast to y=7 before t=70.\n\nBut I cannot, because I start from low.\n\nAt t=66, y=0.\n\nFastest up: t=66 U to y1 t67\n\nt67 U to y2 t68\n\nt68 U to y3 t69\n\nNow at t=69, y=3.\n\nI can go U to y=4 at t=70.\n\nBut y=4 at t=70 is safe.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=69, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 at t=68? Even earlier, no.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nAfter being on y=6 at t=72, I go to y=7 at t=73, but t=73 is late.\n\ny=7 is safe at t=69, for example.\n\nt=69: Δt=5, T=69, y=7 safe.\n\nBut I am only at y=3 at t=69.\n\nIf I could be at y=7 at t=69, then I can stay or move.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nUnless I started moving earlier, but at t=64-66 I had to stay low.\n\nSuppose at t=64, I go U to y=1 at t=65.\n\nThen at t=65, I go U, but to y=2 at t=66 unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 at t=66, but same as before.\n\nI think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car on y=7 and 8.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=70,71,72.\n\nIn my path, I am never on y=7 or 8 during that time.\n\nNow, but at t=72, I am on y=6, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by going to y=8 or something.\n\nAnother point: y=9 is always safe, so once I reach, I can stop.\n\nBut I need to be on y=8 to go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, I reach y=8 at t=74, y=9 at t=75.\n\nBut y=8 is safe at t=73,74, etc.\n\nt=73: Δt=9, T=73, y=8 safe.\n\nBut I am at y=7 at t=73.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 earlier.\n\nEarliest y=8: from y=0 at t=66, to y=8 at t=74: t=66 U y1 t67, ..., t=73 U to y8 t74? Let's see: from y=0 to y=8, 8 steps.\n\nt=66 U to y1 t67\n\nt67 U to y2 t68\n\n...\n\nt=73 U to y8 t74? Start t=66 action to y1 t67, so after k actions, y = k if all U.\n\nAt t=66, after 0 actions at t=66, y=0.\n\nAfter first action t=66 U, y=1 at t=67.\n\nAfter second action t=67 U, y=2 at t=68.\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 actions, y=8 at t=66+8=74.\n\nt=66 action to t=67 y1, so to reach y=8, need 8 actions: from t=66 to t=73 actions U, to y=8 at t=74.\n\nThen to y=9, another action at t=74 U to y9 t75.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I can be on y=8 at t=69, for example, but I can't.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nIn the output, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=64.\n\nH=11, so actions from t=64 to t=74.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 64: S\n\nTurn 65: S\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nBut at turn 74, U to y=9 at t=75.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 73: U, to y=8 at t=74? Let's list y_t:\n\nt=64: y=0\n\na64=S, y65=0\n\na65=S, y66=0\n\na66=U, y67=1\n\na67=U, y68=2\n\na68=U, y69=3\n\na69=U, y70=4\n\na70=U, y71=5\n\na71=U, y72=6\n\na72=U, y73=7\n\na73=U, y74=8\n\na74=U, y75=9\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=72, y72=6, and I go U to y73=7.\n\ny=7 at t=73 is safe.\n\nIn the actions, turn 72: U, which is correct.\n\nNow, but I have 11 actions.\n\nIs there a way with fewer?\n\nSuppose I don't stay at y=0 for two turns.\n\nFor example, at t=64, I go U to y=1 at t=65.\n\nThen at t=65, I must go down to y=0 at t=66 or stay but unsafe.\n\nIf go down, a65=D, y66=0.\n\nThen from there, same as before: a66=U, y67=1, etc.\n\nBut now actions: t=64:U, t=65:D, then t=66:U, ..., same number, 11 actions.\n\nt=64 U, t=65 D, t=66 U, ..., up to t=74 U, that's 11 actions: t=64 to 74.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I could skip some rows during unsafe times, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 to 6 are only unsafe at t=66, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, I could be on y=1 at t=65, then at t=66 I go to y=0, but then I need to go back to y=1 later, which takes extra.\n\nFor example: t=64:U, to y1 t65\n\nt=65:D, to y0 t66\n\nt=66:U, to y1 t67  (now y1 at t67, safe)\n\nBut I was at y1 at t65, now again at t67, wasted.\n\nThen proceed up: t=67:U to y2 t68, etc.\n\nSame as before, but I have an extra D and U for y1, so I have 12 actions? No.\n\nt=64:U to y1 t65\n\nt=65:D to y0 t66\n\nt=66:U to y1 t67\n\nt=67:U to y2 t68\n\n...\n\nt=73:U to y8 t74? From t=67 y1 to y8: 7 steps to y8? y1 to y8 is 7 steps: t=67 y1, t=68 y2, ..., t=73 y7, t=74 y8? t=67 action U to y2 t68? Positions:\n\nt=67: y=1\n\na67:U, y68=2\n\na68:U, y69=3\n\na69:U, y70=4\n\na70:U, y71=5\n\na71:U, y72=6\n\na72:U, y73=7\n\na73:U, y74=8\n\na74:U, y75=9\n\nSo actions: t=64 U, t=65 D, t=66 U, t=67 U, ..., t=74 U, that's from t=64 to t=74, 11 actions same as before.\n\nt=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74: 11 turns.\n\nIf I start with S, same.\n\nSo no better.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the y=7-8 unsafe by being there before.\n\nBut to be on y=7 before t=70, I need to reach y=7 by t=69.\n\nBut from start, at t=64 y0, go up: t=64 U to y1 t65\n\nt65 U to y2 t66 but unsafe at t66, cannot.\n\nIf I go up fast, but stuck at t66.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=64, I go S, stay y0 t65.\n\nt65 U to y1 t66, unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo I must not be on y1-6 at t66, so I must be on y0 at t66.\n\nThus, I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nIn the sequence, I have S at t64 and t65.\n\nBut S is a valid action.\n\nNow, about y=7 and 8, I have no issue.\n\nIn the car state, for k=7 and 8, there are three cars, but I already considered, only the third one causes unsafe at t=70-72.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt1=64.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 64: S\n\nTurn 65: S\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nWith this, I reach y=9 at t=75.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\n\nBut in this case, since we move vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, the collision is only when on the row at that turn.\n\nIn my sequence, for example, at t=70, I am on y=4, no car on y=4 at t=70 since unsafe only t=66.\n\nSimilarly, when I move to y=7 at t=73, at t=73, y=7 is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster by not going through all, but I think not.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, I could go directly if possible, but no.\n\nOr, at t=72, I am on y=6, instead of going to y=7, I could go to y=5 or something, but that delays.\n\nNo.\n\nI think 11 is best.\n\nBut let's count the minimal possible.\n\nThe unsafe at t=66 blocks me for 2 turns (t=64 and t=65 I don't progress), and the unsafe at t=70-72 for y=7-8, but since I am below, it doesn't directly block, but I have to wait until t=73 to be on y=7.\n\nThe period t=70-72, I can be on y=1-6, which are safe then, so I am progressing, no delay.\n\nThe only delay is at the beginning.\n\nSo H min=9 + 2 =11, yes.\n\nWithout cars, H=9.\n\nWith cars, I add 2 turns of waiting at start.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 72: U, to y=7 at t=73.\n\nBut y=7 is safe at t=73.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the car state, for k=7 and k=8, there are cars, but at t=73, Δt=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nAlso, the actions: U, D, S.\n\nIn this case, all S and U except two S at start.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 64: S\n\nTurn 65: S\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nAnd that's 11 actions.\n\nBut H=11, from t=64 to t=74.\n\nIn the format, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps I can write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 64: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut in text, I think.\n\nSince the problem says \"a sequence of actions\", and \"minimal number H\", but I don't need to state H, just the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the turns.\n\nNow, I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me double-check if at some point I might have collision.\n\nFor example, at t=70, y=4, freeway y=4: cars, but at t=70, Δt=6, T=70.\n\ny=4 car: at t1=64, span [-71,-48] for right-moving.\n\nAt T=70, Δt=6, span [ -71 + 24*6 , -48 + 24*6 ] = [ -71 + 144, -48 + 144] = [73, 96], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nAt t=72, y=6, car for y=6: similar, at T=72, Δt=8, [ -71 + 24*8, -48 + 24*8] = [ -71 + 192, -48 + 192] = [121, 144], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=73, y=7, freeway y=7: cars at T=73, Δt=9.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4*9, 48 + 4*9] = [37+36, 48+36] = [73,84], 0 not in.\n\nSecond: [1 + 36, 12+36] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nThird: [-35 + 36, -24 + 36] = [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 64\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any unsafe row at the unsafe times.\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 66\\) (relative time \\(\\Delta t = 2\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 70, 71, 72\\) (relative times \\(\\Delta t = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n\nTo avoid the unsafe turn at \\(T = 66\\) for rows \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\), the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 65 and 66 by using the \"S\" (stay) action at turns 64 and 65. Starting from turn 66, the player moves up (\"U\") each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, ensuring that \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are only occupied after the unsafe period (i.e., at turns 73 and 74, respectively).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 64, \"S\": Player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 65.\n- At turn 65, \"S\": Player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 66.\n- At turn 66, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 67.\n- At turn 67, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 68.\n- At turn 68, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 69.\n- At turn 69, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 70.\n- At turn 70, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 71.\n- At turn 71, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 72.\n- At turn 72, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 73.\n- At turn 73, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 74.\n- At turn 74, \"U\": Player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 75.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- The player is never on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 66.\n- The player is never on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 70, 71, or 72.\n- All positions during the sequence are safe, as verified by the car positions at each turn.\n\nThe player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 75 after 11 actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 64: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right at constant speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for a car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Importantly, if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on the y I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nThe current turn is t_1 = 66. Player is at (0,0). I need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn 66 to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at each future turn. The car positions are given at turn 66, and they move linearly with time.\n\nLet me denote the time difference Δt = T - 66 for future turns.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is:\n\n- If direction is right: [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt] because head is at h, tail at τ, and for right-moving, head is greater, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span at T is [h - s * (T - t_1), τ - s * (T - t_1)] — since it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars are right-moving, I think? Let me check the directions.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) — head -48, tail -83? That seems odd. Head should be the front, so for right-moving, head should be larger than tail, but here head is -48, tail is -83, and since -48 > -83, yes, head is at -48, tail at -83, so the car is from x=-83 to x=-48, and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) — head -48, tail -71, since -48 > -71, so car from -71 to -48, moving right.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFor (48,37,right,4): head 48, tail 37, since 48>37, car from 37 to 48.\n\n(12,1,right,4): head 12, tail 1, car from 1 to 12.\n\n(-24,-35,right,4): head -24, tail -35, car from -35 to -24.\n\nAll are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at turn T.\n\nThat is, if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) for that car at time T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt], where Δt = T - 66.\n\nAnd the min is τ + s*Δt, max is h + s*Δt, since h > τ for right-moving.\n\nIn the notation, head h is the front, so for right-moving, as time increases, both head and tail increase by s per turn.\n\nSo span at T: [τ + s*(T-66), h + s*(T-66)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is between τ + s*(T-66) and h + s*(T-66), inclusive? Probably inclusive, I assume.\n\nThe problem says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", so inclusive.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 66. I need to move to y=9.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway with cars, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. So at turn 66, player is at (0,0), which is safe.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nBut to get there, I have to go through y=1 to 8, and avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, since I can move up, down, or stay, I need to plan a path through the freeways.\n\nMinimal turns would be to go straight up, but I might have to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each car, find the times when 0 is in [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nWhich means τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt\n\nSo, solving for Δt:\n\nFrom τ + s*Δt ≤ 0: Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s*Δt: Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nSo Δt must satisfy: ceil(-h/s) ≤ Δt ≤ floor(-τ/s) ? Let's be careful with inequalities.\n\nSince Δt is integer (turns), and the inequalities.\n\nSet Δt = T - 66.\n\nFor a given car, 0 is in span at Δt if:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\n0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ -h ≤ s Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nSo Δt must satisfy: -h/s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s), but need to check the inequalities.\n\nBecause -h/s ≤ Δt and Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nNow, since h and τ are integers, s integer, we can compute.\n\nAlso, since the span includes endpoints, equality is allowed.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-48, τ=-83, s=36, direction right.\n\nSo for this car, Δt must satisfy:\n\n-(-48)/36 ≤ Δt ≤ -(-83)/36 ⇒ 48/36 ≤ Δt ≤ 83/36\n\nSimplify: 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's compute numerically.\n\n48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt ≥ ceil(1.333) = 2? No.\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt ≥ 2? Because 1.333, so Δt must be at least 2? Let's see:\n\n-h/s = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt must be greater than or equal to this, so since integer, Δt ≥ 2.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound: Δt ≤ -τ/s = -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt ≤ floor(2.305) = 2.\n\nSo Δt ≥ ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nΔt ≤ floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo Δt = 2\n\nThus for freeway 1, car is at x=0 only at Δt=2, i.e., turn T=66+2=68.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Car: (-48,-83,right,36), identical to freeway 1.\n\nSo also only at T=68.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48,-83,right,36), so also T=68.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nh=-48, τ=-71, s=24\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -(-48)/24 = 48/24 = 2\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -(-71)/24 = 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so floor(2.958)=2? 71/24=2.958, floor is 2? But 2 ≤ 2.958, yes, and Δt ≤ floor(2.958)=2? No.\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = 71/24 ≈2.958, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ 2? 2.958, so Δt can be 2? Let's see inequality.\n\nΔt ≥ 2\n\nΔt ≤ 71/24 ≈2.958\n\nSince Δt integer, possible Δt=2? Because 2 ≤ 2.958? 2 is less than 2.958, so Δt=2 is possible? But let's check.\n\nLower bound: Δt ≥ 48/24 = 2 exactly\n\nUpper bound: Δt ≤ 71/24 ≈2.958, so Δt ≤ 2 since integer? 2.958, floor is 2, but Δt ≤ 2.958, so Δt=2 is allowed, Δt=3 would be 3>2.958 not allowed.\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = 71/24\n\nFor Δt=2: 71/24 ≈2.958, 2 ≤ 2.958, so yes.\n\nFor Δt=3: 3 > 2.958, so not ≤, so not allowed.\n\nSo Δt=2 only.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 and 6 same as 4, I think.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-71,right,24), same as 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll s=4.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=4\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -48/4 = -12\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -37/4 = -9.25\n\nNow, Δt ≥ -12 and Δt ≤ -9.25\n\nSince Δt = T-66, and T≥66, so Δt ≥0, so -12 ≤ Δt ≤ -9.25, but Δt ≥0, so no overlap. Thus this car never at x=0 for Δt≥0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4)\n\nh=12, τ=1, s=4\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -12/4 = -3\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -1/4 = -0.25\n\nSo Δt ≥ -3 and Δt ≤ -0.25\n\nAgain, for Δt≥0, no, since -0.25 <0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, s=4\n\nΔt ≥ -h/s = -(-24)/4 = 24/4 = 6\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -(-35)/4 = 35/4 = 8.75\n\nSo Δt ≥ 6 and Δt ≤ 8.75\n\nThus Δt = 6,7,8\n\nSince integer.\n\nΔt≥6 and Δt≤8.75, so Δt=6,7,8\n\nNow freeway 8 has the same cars as freeway 7: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo identical to freeway 7.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 8, car at x=0 when Δt=6,7,8\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, when it is occupied (i.e., some car at x=0):\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied at T=68 (Δt=2)\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at T=68\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied at T=68\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied at T=68 (since same as above, Δt=2)\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at T=68\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied at T=68\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied at T=72,73,74 (Δt=6,7,8)\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at T=72,73,74\n\nT=66 + Δt\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, occupied at Δt=6,7,8 → T=72,73,74\n\nFor freeways 1-6, occupied only at T=68.\n\nBut freeways 1-6 are all occupied only at T=68, and freeways 7-8 occupied at T=72,73,74.\n\nNow, at other times, no car at x=0, so safe to be on that freeway.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 66.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I only care about y=1 to 8 during the journey.\n\nLet me denote the turns.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T.\n\nI start at T=66, y=0.\n\nI can take actions U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y for the next turn, except S stays.\n\nThe position update is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nSo at time t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut collision is checked at time t when on y_t.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and if at that turn, for that freeway, a car is at x=0, collision.\n\nIf I move to a different y at turn T, I am not on that new y until turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, I am on y_T, and I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision only depends on y_T and the cars at turn T.\n\nFor each freeway, I know when it is dangerous.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be 9, if I go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, then at turn 66+9=75, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if during the path, when I am on freeways, it is safe.\n\nStart: turn 66, y=0, safe.\n\nAfter action a_66, y_{67} = y_66 + Δy, so if I go up, y_67=1.\n\nThen at turn 67, I am on y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to be on y=1 at some turn, y=2 at some turn, etc., up to y=8, and then to y=9.\n\nBut since I can stay or move down, I might spend multiple turns on the same y or go down, but to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible, only deviating to avoid danger.\n\nThe dangerous times are:\n\nFor y=1: dangerous only at T=68\n\nSimilarly y=2 at T=68\n\ny=3 at T=68\n\ny=4 at T=68\n\ny=5 at T=68\n\ny=6 at T=68\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=72,73,74\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=72,73,74\n\nAt other times, all freeways are safe.\n\nNow, I start at turn 66, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up each turn, reaching y=9 at turn 75.\n\nLet's see the positions:\n\n- Turn 66: y=0, safe\n\n- Action a_66: if U, then y_67=1\n\n- Turn 67: on y=1. Now, y=1 is safe except at T=68. Turn 67 is not 68, so safe? T=67, Δt=1, not 2, so for freeway 1, occupied at Δt=2, not 1, so at T=67, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways safe except at specific times.\n\nAt T=67, for y=1, no car at x=0, since only at T=68.\n\nSo turn 67, y=1 safe.\n\nThen action a_67: if U, y_68=2\n\nTurn 68: on y=2. Now y=2 is freeway, and at T=68, it is occupied, since freeway 2 dangerous at T=68.\n\nCollision!\n\nIf I go straight up, at turn 68 I would be on y=2 or which y?\n\nLet's timeline:\n\nTurn 66: y=0, safe\n\na_66=U → y_67=1\n\nTurn 67: y=1, safe (since T=67 ≠68)\n\na_67=U → y_68=2\n\nTurn 68: y=2, and at T=68, y=2 is occupied (since freeway 2 dangerous at T=68), so collision.\n\nIf I go slower, but I want minimal turns.\n\nPerhaps I can delay so that I am not on y=2 at T=68.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are all dangerous only at T=68, so at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 dangerous at T=72,73,74.\n\nSo for the lower freeways, I need to not be on them at T=68.\n\nSince all y=1 to 6 are dangerous at exactly T=68, I should avoid being on any of y=1 to 6 at turn 68.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 and 8, avoid at T=72,73,74.\n\nNow, at turn 68, if I am on y=0 or y=7 or above, or y=9, but I start from y=0, and y=7 is high.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but at turn 68, I might not be at y=9 yet.\n\nSince I start at turn 66 y=0, and I need to go up.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is turn 75 if I go up every turn, but I hit collision at turn 68 on y=2.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=1-6 at T=68.\n\nSimilarly, later for y=7-8 at T=72-74.\n\nFirst, let's handle the T=68 issue.\n\nTurn 68 is critical for y=1-6.\n\nI need to be at y=0 or y>=7 at turn 68.\n\nBut at turn 66, I am at y=0.\n\nI can stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 for some turns, but that might increase time.\n\nI can go up but slowly so that at turn 68 I am at y=0 or y=7+.\n\ny=7 is freeway, which might be dangerous, but at T=68, for y=7, is it dangerous? y=7 dangerous at T=72,73,74, not at T=68. At T=68, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at T=68.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo at turn 68, I need to be at y=0 or y=7 or y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might be too far.\n\nSimilarly, for later, at T=72,73,74, I need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI start turn 66 y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9 turns, but due to obstacles, might be more.\n\nSince y=1-6 are only dangerous at one turn, I can pass through them at other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=7-8, dangerous at three turns, but safe at other times.\n\nFirst, let's list safe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: safe except T=68\n\ny=2: safe except T=68\n\ny=3: safe except T=68\n\ny=4: safe except T=68\n\ny=5: safe except T=68\n\ny=6: safe except T=68\n\ny=7: safe except T=72,73,74\n\ny=8: safe except T=72,73,74\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, spending at least one turn on each y from 1 to 8? No, I can skip y if I move fast, but since I move one step at a time, I must visit each integer y between start and end, but I can stay or move, so I don't have to spend a full turn on each, but I pass through them.\n\nFor example, to go from y=0 to y=9, I must be on y=1 at some turn, y=2 at some turn, etc., up to y=8, and then to y=9.\n\nAnd for each, I need to be on that y at a time when it is safe.\n\nSpecifically, for y=k, I need to be on y=k at some turn T where it is safe for that k.\n\nAnd the turn when I am on y=k, it must be a safe turn for freeway k.\n\nNow, for y=1, I need to be on it at T ≠68\n\nSimilarly for y=2, T≠68, and so on to y=6, T≠68\n\nFor y=7, need to be on it at T not in {72,73,74}\n\nFor y=8, T not in {72,73,74}\n\nThen y=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, I also need to sequence the actions to move between them.\n\nSince the constraints are on the time when I occupy each y.\n\nThe critical part is that I must avoid T=68 for y=1-6, and avoid T=72-74 for y=7-8.\n\nNow, the earliest I can start is turn 66.\n\nIf I go up immediately, at turn 67 I am on y=1, which is safe since T=67≠68.\n\nThen at turn 68, if I am on y=1, but y=1 is dangerous at T=68, so I cannot be on y=1 at T=68.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=2 at T=68, dangerous.\n\nSo at turn 68, I must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nI could be on y=0, or y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 is possible if I stay, or y=7+ if I move fast.\n\nFrom turn 66, I can go up to y=1 at turn 67.\n\nThen from there, if I go up, at turn 68 I would be on y=2, dangerous.\n\nSo I need to not go up at turn 67, or something.\n\nAt turn 67, I am on y=1 (if I went up at 66).\n\nNow, action at turn 67: if I go up, y_68=2, then at turn 68 on y=2, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y_68=1, then at turn 68 on y=1, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I go down, y_68=0, then at turn 68 on y=0, safe, since no cars.\n\nBut then I am back to y=0, which is not progress.\n\nSo from turn 67 on y=1, if I do anything except go down, I might be on y=1 or y=2 at turn 68, both dangerous.\n\nIf I go down, I go back to y=0 at turn 68.\n\nThen I can try again later.\n\nBut that wastes turns.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1-6 at turn 68, I can be at y=0 at turn 68, or at y=7 or above.\n\nBut at turn 66, y=0, to reach y=7, I need at least 7 turns: from turn 66 to 72, y=7 at turn 72? Let's see.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nTurn 66: y=0\n\na66=U → y67=1\n\na67=U → y68=2 — but dangerous if on y=2 at T=68.\n\nAt turn 68, if y=2, dangerous.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 68: from turn 66, I need to go up 7 times in 2 turns? Impossible, since I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAt turn 66, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 67, y<=1.\n\nAfter 2 actions, at turn 68, y<=2.\n\nSo at turn 68, the maximum y I can be is 2, if I went up both times.\n\ny=0,1, or 2.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 dangerous at T=68, y=2 dangerous at T=68.\n\nSo the only safe position at turn 68 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y=0 at turn 68.\n\nThat means, from turn 66, I cannot go up on turn 66 or turn 67, so I must stay at y=0 for both turns? Turn 66 and turn 67 actions.\n\nAt turn 66, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nI take action a66.\n\nIf a66=S, then y67=0\n\nThen at turn 67, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen action a67.\n\nIf a67=S, y68=0, then at turn 68, on y=0, safe.\n\nIf a67=U, y68=1, then at turn 68 on y=1, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if a66=U, then y67=1, turn 67 on y=1 safe, but then a67 must be S or D or U.\n\nIf a67=S, y68=1, dangerous.\n\nIf a67=U, y68=2, dangerous.\n\nIf a67=D, y68=0, safe.\n\nSo the only way to be safe at turn 68 is to be at y=0.\n\nTherefore, I must have y68=0.\n\nWhich means that at turn 67, I must have y67=0, and a67=S or D, but if y67=0, a67=D, y68=-1 not possible, y min 0, so y68=0 only if a67=S when y67=0.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, -1) =0, I assume it stays 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9, U stays 9.\n\nSo if y67=0, a67=D, y68=0.\n\na67=S, y68=0.\n\na67=U, y68=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y67 to be 0, it must come from turn 66.\n\nIf at turn 66, a66=S, then y67=0.\n\nOr a66=D, but y66=0, a66=D, y67=0.\n\na66=U, y67=1.\n\nSo to have y67=0, I must have a66=S or D at turn 66.\n\nSimilarly for y68=0.\n\nBut for safety at turn 68, I need y68=0.\n\nSo I must choose actions such that at turn 68, y=0.\n\nTherefore, from turn 66 to 68, I should stay at y=0.\n\nThat is, a66=S or D, but since y=0, D also keeps at 0, so a66=S or D, both result in y67=0.\n\nThen at turn 67, y=0, a67=S or D, both result in y68=0.\n\nSo I can do S or D at these turns, but since I want to minimize time, and S and D both keep y=0, I can do S to not move, or D but it stays, same effect.\n\nSo for minimal action, I should do S to stay, I think, but it doesn't matter for position, but for the sequence, I can choose S.\n\nNow, after turn 68, I can start moving up.\n\nTurn 68: y=0, safe.\n\nNow I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut there is another danger zone at T=72,73,74 for y=7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's see when I can move.\n\nFrom turn 68, y=0.\n\nI can go up.\n\nNow, the freeways y=1 to 6 are safe at all times except T=68, which is past, so now they are always safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe except at T=72,73,74.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal time from here: if I go up every turn from turn 68.\n\nTurn 68: y=0\n\na68=U → y69=1\n\nTurn 69: on y=1, safe (since T=69 ≠68, and no other danger)\n\na69=U → y70=2\n\nTurn 70: y=2, safe\n\na70=U → y71=3\n\nTurn 71: y=3, safe\n\na71=U → y72=4? Let's list:\n\nAfter a68=U, turn 69: y=1\n\na69=U, turn 70: y=2\n\na70=U, turn 71: y=3\n\na71=U, turn 72: y=4\n\nNow turn 72: y=4, but y=4 is freeway, and at T=72, is it dangerous? y=4 is dangerous only at T=68, which is past, so safe. y=4 not dangerous at T=72.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 dangerous at T=72,73,74.\n\nAt turn 72, I am on y=4, which is fine.\n\nThen a72=U → y73=5\n\nTurn 73: y=5, safe (only dangerous at T=68)\n\na73=U → y74=6\n\nTurn 74: y=6, safe\n\na74=U → y75=7\n\nTurn 75: on y=7\n\nNow T=75, is y=7 dangerous? y=7 dangerous at T=72,73,74, but T=75 not in, so safe? T=75, Δt from 66 is 9, for freeway 7, dangerous at Δt=6,7,8 → T=72,73,74, so T=75 not dangerous, safe.\n\nSimilarly, action a75=U → y76=8\n\nTurn 76: on y=8, T=76, Δt=10, dangerous times T=72,73,74, so safe.\n\na76=U → y77=9\n\nTurn 77: on y=9, safe, and I reached.\n\nBut I started from turn 68 at y=0, and reached y=9 at turn 77.\n\nTurn 77 is turn number, but I need the sequence from turn 66.\n\nFirst, from turn 66 to 68, I need to stay at y=0.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 66: since y=0, to stay, I can do S or D, but both keep y=0. Probably S is fine, or D, but S is simpler.\n\nSimilarly turn 67: S or D to keep y=0.\n\nThen turn 68: y=0, now I go up.\n\nIn the above, from turn 68 to 77, I used 9 turns to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut total from turn 66: I stayed at y=0 for turns 66 and 67, so wasted two turns.\n\nThen from turn 68 to 77: 10 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nTurn 66: action a66, to stay, say S\n\nThen turn 67: y=0 (since a66=S), action a67=S, then turn 68: y=0\n\nThen a68=U, turn 69: y=1\n\na69=U, turn 70: y=2\n\na70=U, turn 71: y=3\n\na71=U, turn 72: y=4\n\na72=U, turn 73: y=5\n\na73=U, turn 74: y=6\n\na74=U, turn 75: y=7\n\na75=U, turn 76: y=8\n\na76=U, turn 77: y=9\n\nSo at turn 77, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 66 to 76? Actions from t=66 to t=76, that's 11 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{66} to a_{76}, that's 11 actions, but H turns, I think H is the number of actions until I reach y=9 at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe player position after H actions.\n\nAt turn t_1 =66, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1+1, and so on.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) at some turn T, meaning that at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nAnd the actions from t_1 to T-1, since after action at T-1, y_T is set.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t to t+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t+H, y_{t+H}=9.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H} =9\"\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, at time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are applied at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt time t_1, before any action, position is given.\n\nAfter action at t_1, position at t_1 +1, etc.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, position at t_1 + H.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=66.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 77, y=9, so t_1 + H =77, so H=11, since 66 + H =77, H=11.\n\nActions from t=66 to t=76, that's 11 actions: indices t=66 to 76.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: t_1, t=1: t_1+1, ..., t=H-1: t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for H=11, actions at t=66 to 76.\n\nAnd y_{77}=9.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal is 9, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nIn this sequence, I spent two turns at y=0 at the beginning.\n\nBut I could go faster if I can reach y=7 by turn 68, but I can't, since from turn 66, after two actions, at turn 68, y<=2.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at turn 68.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y=0 at turn 68.\n\nNow, for the later part, in the sequence above, when I reached y=7 at turn 75, which is after T=74, so safe, and y=8 at turn 76, safe, then to y=9.\n\nBut at turn 72,73,74, I was on y=4,5,6, which are safe at those times.\n\ny=4,5,6 are only dangerous at T=68, not at later times.\n\nNow, however, I have the issue with y=7 and 8 at T=72,73,74.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=7 at turn 75, which is fine.\n\nBut can I go faster?\n\nFor example, after turn 68, I start from y=0.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can only one step per turn.\n\nMinimal from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, but I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=72,73,74.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=7 at turn 75, which is after, so fine.\n\nBut at turn 72,73,74, where am I?\n\nIn the sequence: turn 72: y=4\n\nTurn 73: y=5\n\nTurn 74: y=6\n\nAll not y=7 or 8, so safe.\n\nThen turn 75: y=7, safe\n\nTurn 76: y=8, safe? T=76, not 72-74, safe.\n\nTurn 77: y=9.\n\nBut I reached at turn 77 with H=11.\n\nH=11 turns from start.\n\nSince I wasted two turns at start.\n\nBut perhaps I can go down later or something to avoid the later danger, but in this case, the later danger is not an issue because I pass y=7 and 8 after T=74.\n\nAnother idea: I could go up immediately but then at turn 68, since I must be at y=0, I need to go down or stay, but from above, only by staying at y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=6 quickly and stay there or something, but y=6 is dangerous at T=68, so I cannot be on it at that time.\n\nFor example, if I go up as fast as possible from turn 66.\n\nTurn 66: y=0, a66=U → y67=1\n\nTurn 67: y=1, now I cannot stay or go up because at turn 68 I would be on y=1 or 2, dangerous.\n\nSo I must go down: a67=D → y68=0\n\nThen at turn 68, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, same as before, I go up to y=9.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 66: U, turn 67: D, then turn 68: y=0.\n\nThen same as before, but I used one U and one D, net no progress, same as staying.\n\nThen from turn 68, I need 9 turns to y=9, reaching turn 77.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I do nothing at turn 66 and 67, stay, then go up.\n\nNow, with the later danger, but in my sequence I avoided it.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 before turn 75.\n\nBut from turn 68 y=0, earliest to y=9 is turn 77, since 9 steps.\n\nTurn 68: start y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 69 y=1\n\n2: t70 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 actions: turn 77 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I start from turn 66, without delay, I could reach y=9 at turn 75, but I cannot because of the collision at turn 68.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the later issue with fewer.\n\nAnother point: at T=72,73,74, y=7 and 8 are dangerous.\n\nIn my sequence, I am not on them during those times.\n\nBut suppose I want to reach earlier, I cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower in the beginning and faster later, but since I have to wait until after turn 68 to move, I cannot start moving up until turn 69 or something.\n\nIn my sequence, I start moving up at turn 68 action.\n\nturn 68 action U, to y=1 at turn 69.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=7 after turn 74.\n\nIn my case, I do.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nSince y=1-6 are safe after T=68, and y=7-8 safe after T=74.\n\nThe critical times are only those.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=1 at some T>68, similarly up to y=6.\n\nThen y=7 at T>74 or T<72, but T<72 might be possible.\n\nFor example, can I be on y=7 before T=72?\n\nYes, for example, at T=71, y=7 is safe, since dangerous only 72,73,74.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at T=71 or earlier.\n\nBut to reach y=7 early, I need to go up fast from start.\n\nBut at turn 68, I must be at y=0.\n\nSo from turn 66 to 68, I stay at y=0.\n\nThen from turn 68, I go up.\n\nEarliest to y=7: from y=0 at turn 68.\n\nAfter k actions, y=k at turn 68+k.\n\nSo y=7 at turn 68+7=75.\n\nSimilarly, as before.\n\nIf I could be at y=7 at turn 71, for example.\n\nBut turn 71: from turn 66, after 5 actions? Turn 66 to 71 is 5 turns later? Time from start.\n\nAt turn 66: y=0\n\nAfter action a66: turn 67, y<=1\n\na67: turn 68, y<=2\n\nBut at turn 68, y must be 0.\n\nSo y68=0.\n\nThen a68: turn 69, y<=1\n\na69: turn 70, y<=2\n\na70: turn 71, y<=3\n\na71: turn 72, y<=4\n\n...\n\nSo at turn 71, y <=3, since from y68=0, after 3 actions (a68,a69,a70), y71 <=3.\n\nCannot be at y=7 at turn 71.\n\nSimilarly, earliest y=7 is at turn 75, as before.\n\nAnd at turn 75, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=11, I can reach.\n\nBut the sequence has 11 actions.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have to specify the actions from turn 66.\n\nIn the beginning, I need to stay at y=0 for turns 66 and 67.\n\nSo actions: turn 66: S (stay)\n\nturn 67: S (stay)\n\nThen turn 68: U (up)\n\nturn 69: U\n\nturn 70: U\n\nturn 71: U\n\nturn 72: U\n\nturn 73: U\n\nturn 74: U\n\nturn 75: U\n\nturn 76: U\n\nThen at turn 77, y=9.\n\nAfter action at turn 76: U, y77=9.\n\nActions from turn 66 to 76, that's 11 actions.\n\nt_1 + H = 66 + H =77, so H=11.\n\nSequence: a66 to a76.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nWith y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nHere t_1=66, H=11, so actions from turn 66 to turn 76 (since t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = 66 to 76)\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 66 + 11 -1 = 76.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd y_{77} =9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I used all U except the first two S.\n\nBut at turn 74: U to y=7? Let's list positions to confirm.\n\nTurn 66: y=0, action a66=S → y67=0\n\nTurn 67: y=0, action a67=S → y68=0\n\nTurn 68: y=0, action a68=U → y69=1\n\nTurn 69: y=1, action a69=U → y70=2\n\nTurn 70: y=2, action a70=U → y71=3\n\nTurn 71: y=3, action a71=U → y72=4\n\nTurn 72: y=4, action a72=U → y73=5\n\nTurn 73: y=5, action a73=U → y74=6\n\nTurn 74: y=6, action a74=U → y75=7\n\nTurn 75: y=7, action a75=U → y76=8\n\nTurn 76: y=8, action a76=U → y77=9\n\nNow, collisions: at each turn, check if on freeway and if occupied.\n\nTurn 66: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nTurn 67: y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 68: y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 69: y=1, freeway 1. T=69, not 68, so safe.\n\nTurn 70: y=2, freeway 2, T=70≠68, safe.\n\nTurn 71: y=3, freeway 3, T=71≠68, safe.\n\nTurn 72: y=4, freeway 4, T=72≠68, safe. Also, for y=4, dangerous only at T=68, so safe.\n\nTurn 73: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nTurn 74: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nTurn 75: y=7, freeway 7. T=75, not 72,73,74, so safe.\n\nTurn 76: y=8, freeway 8, T=76 not 72-74, safe.\n\nTurn 77: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nI reached at turn 77.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nFor example, if I can avoid the two waits at the beginning.\n\nBut at turn 68, I must be at y=0, so I need to be there, which requires not moving up in the first two turns.\n\nPerhaps I can go down later, but I don't see how.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go up to y=6 before turn 68 and stay or something, but y=6 is dangerous at T=68, so I cannot be on it.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up fast to y=6.\n\nFrom turn 66: a66=U → y67=1\n\nThen at turn 67, y=1, I can go up to y=2, but at turn 68 y=2 dangerous.\n\nIf at turn 67, I go down to y=0, as before.\n\nNo way.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 before the danger, but at turn 68, y=7 is possible only if I were at y=7 at turn 67, but from turn 66, after one action, y=1 max at turn 67.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nAt T=72,73,74, occupied.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=4,5,6 at those times, not 7 or 8.\n\ny=4 at T=72, etc., fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by being on y=7 or 8 before T=72.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at turn 71.\n\nBut from above, at turn 71, with y68=0, after three actions, y<=3, so y=7 impossible.\n\nIf I start moving earlier, but I cannot because of turn 68 constraint.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from turn 66 to 76.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list them.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used S for turn 66 and 67.\n\nI could use D, but same position.\n\nS is fine.\n\nNow, for the later actions, all U.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 74: U to y=7 at turn 75.\n\nThen turn 75: U to y=8 at turn 76.\n\nThen turn 76: U to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nNow, I need to output in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format, it just asks for the sequence, not H separately, I think.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence...\"\n\nBut in the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by not staying but going down, but same.\n\nAnother thought: for freeway 7 and 8, since they are dangerous only at three turns, I might pass through quickly when safe.\n\nBut in this case, since I pass after, it's fine.\n\nSuppose I go up slowly so that I reach y=7 after turn 74.\n\nBut in my case, I do.\n\nPerhaps I can save one turn.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at turn 76.\n\nBut from y=0 at turn 68, after 8 actions: turn 76 y=8, then need another action to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nMinimal 9 actions from y=0.\n\nCannot.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start from 0.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 66: S\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nIn the list, turn 75: U to y=8, then turn 76: U to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 75 action is U, which sets y76=8, then turn 76 action U sets y77=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI could write the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 66: S \\\\ Turn 67: S \\\\ Turn 68: U \\\\ Turn 69: U \\\\ Turn 70: U \\\\ Turn 71: U \\\\ Turn 72: U \\\\ Turn 73: U \\\\ Turn 74: U \\\\ Turn 75: U \\\\ Turn 76: U }\n\nBut the turn numbers: since t_1=66, and actions up to t_1 + H -1 =76.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the box, I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid one S by going down, but no benefit.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, instead of staying, I could go up and then down, but same as staying, net zero.\n\nFor example, turn 66: U, then turn 67: D, then turn 68: y=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut in that case, actions are U and D, which might be different, but position same.\n\nI think S is simpler.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, same.\n\nIn the sequence, if I do U and D, it might look like I moved but didn't.\n\nBut position-wise, same.\n\nI think S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, all actions are specified.\n\nPerhaps I need to confirm if at some point I could have moved faster, but I don't think so.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, since dangerous at T=72,73,74, and I am on y=7 at T=75, which is fine.\n\nBut if I could be on y=7 at T=71, for example, but impossible.\n\nT=71: from turn 68 y=0, after three actions, turn 71 y=3 max.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, this should be minimal.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nIn the answer, I need to write it.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car positions.\n\nFor example, at turn 75, y=7, T=75, Δt=75-66=9, freeway 7 dangerous at Δt=6,7,8 (T=72,73,74), so Δt=9 not dangerous, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 66\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This sequence ensures the player is not on any dangerous freeway at the critical turns when cars occupy \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Critical Turn Analysis:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are dangerous only at turn \\(T = 68\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) from \\(t_1\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous at turns \\(T = 72, 73, 74\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = 6, 7, 8\\) from \\(t_1\\)).\n- To avoid collision at \\(T = 68\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) since \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are occupied and \\(y \\geq 7\\) is unreachable by \\(T = 68\\) from \\(y = 0\\).\n- After \\(T = 68\\), freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are safe at all times, and freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) become safe after \\(T = 74\\).\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Turns 66 and 67**: Stay at \\(y = 0\\) using \"S\" actions to avoid being on any freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 68\\).\n- **Turns 68 to 76**: Move up (\"U\") continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 77. This path avoids \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) during the dangerous turns \\(72, 73, 74\\) (player is on \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) respectively, which are safe).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- The sequence consists of 11 actions from turn 66 to turn 76, resulting in \\(y_{77} = 9\\).\n- Actions:\n  - Turn 66: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n  - Turn 67: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n  - Turn 68: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 69)\n  - Turn 69: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 70)\n  - Turn 70: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 71)\n  - Turn 71: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 72)\n  - Turn 72: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 73)\n  - Turn 73: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 74)\n  - Turn 74: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 75)\n  - Turn 75: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 76)\n  - Turn 76: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 77)\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 66-68**: Player at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- **Turn 69**: \\(y = 1\\), safe (\\(T \\neq 68\\)).\n- **Turn 70**: \\(y = 2\\), safe (\\(T \\neq 68\\)).\n- **Turn 71**: \\(y = 3\\), safe (\\(T \\neq 68\\)).\n- **Turn 72**: \\(y = 4\\), safe (\\(T \\neq 68\\) and \\(y = 4\\) only dangerous at \\(T = 68\\)).\n- **Turn 73**: \\(y = 5\\), safe (\\(T \\neq 68\\)).\n- **Turn 74**: \\(y = 6\\), safe (\\(T \\neq 68\\)).\n- **Turn 75**: \\(y = 7\\), safe (\\(T = 75\\) not in \\(\\{72, 73, 74\\}\\)).\n- **Turn 76**: \\(y = 8\\), safe (\\(T = 76\\) not in \\(\\{72, 73, 74\\}\\)).\n- **Turn 77**: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no freeway).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 11\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 66: S \\\\ Turn 67: S \\\\ Turn 68: U \\\\ Turn 69: U \\\\ Turn 70: U \\\\ Turn 71: U \\\\ Turn 72: U \\\\ Turn 73: U \\\\ Turn 74: U \\\\ Turn 75: U \\\\ Turn 76: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, at the turn when the player is on a freeway y, if at that turn, there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if they move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T they are still on y, and at T+1 they are on y+1.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 68. Player at (0,0). I need to go to (0,9), so I need to move up through y=1 to y=8 without getting hit.\n\nFirst, I should model where the cars are at any future turn, since they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me denote the time from current turn. Let τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn t1.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need the span at time τ.\n\nThe span for left-moving car: [h - s τ, τ - s τ]? Let's see the update:\n\nFor left-moving (I think left-moving means decreasing x, so direction left? But in the notation, it says \"left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1, it's (-48, -83, right, 36). But head and tail, with direction.\n\nLet's interpret the head and tail.\n\nFor a right-moving car, head is the front, so if moving right, head has higher x, tail lower. So span is from tail to head, [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head has lower x? Let's see.\n\nIn the left-moving example: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and it moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so if it's moving left, decreasing x, then at later time, both decrease, so head should be the right end if moving left? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is always the front, and \"tail\" is the back, regardless of direction.\n\nBut in the span notation, for left-moving, it's given as [h, τ], which might not be sorted.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). Now, -48 and -83, with direction right.\n\nSince direction is right, and head and tail, I think head is the front, so for right-moving, front has higher x, but here h = -48, τ = -83, -48 > -83, so head is at -48, tail at -83, so span from τ to h, [-83, -48].\n\nThen for right-moving, at time T, span [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] = [-83 + 36 τ, -48 + 36 τ] where τ = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if there was one, span [h - s τ, τ - s τ] but since head and tail might be such that h > τ or not, but in the movement, it decreases.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly on freeway 7 and 8, but let's list all cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h,τ,d,s) = (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 2: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so all have increasing x, span from tail to head.\n\nFor a car, at time τ relative to t1, position is:\n\nTail position: τ(t) = τ + s * τ? Let t be time since t1, so Δt = t.\n\nFor each car, initial tail and head at t=0.\n\nThen at time t, tail position: tail_0 + s * t for right-moving, since moving right.\n\nSimilarly, head position: head_0 + s * t\n\nThen span is [tail_0 + s t, head_0 + s t]\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in [tail_0 + s (T-t1), head_0 + s (T-t1)]\n\nThat is, tail_0 + s (T-t1) <= 0 <= head_0 + s (T-t1)\n\nSince tail < head for all, I think.\n\nIn the states, for freeway 1: tail = -83, head = -48, so -83 < -48, so span from low to high.\n\nSimilarly others: freeway 4: tail=-71, head=-48, -71 < -48.\n\nFreeway 7: first car tail=37, head=48? No, (48,37,right,4), so head=48, tail=37? But 48>37, so tail=37, head=48.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), tail=1, head=12.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), tail=-35, head=-24.\n\nAll have tail < head.\n\nSo span [tail_0 + s t, head_0 + s t] at time t.\n\nPlayer at turn T is on y_T, and collision if for that y, and for some car on that row, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at t=0 (τ=0, turn t1).\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so safe. Similarly, y=9 might be safe, but we need to reach (0,9), so at y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9), so after moving to y=9, we should be there.\n\nNow, the path: from y=0 to y=9, moving through y=1 to 8.\n\nEach move takes one turn: when we choose action at turn T, it affects position at T+1.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if we are on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute turn, so relative to t1, t = T - t1.\n\nSet t = T - t1, so t starts from 0.\n\nAt time t (turn t1 + t), player is at y_t.\n\ny_t for t=0 is 0.\n\nThen action a_{t1 + t} chosen at turn t1+t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nΔy_t: +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\ny_{t+1} must be in 0 to 9.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t is between 1 and 8 inclusive, and for some car on row y_t, 0 is in [tail_0 + s t, head_0 + s t] for that car.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time H, so at turn t1 + H, we are at (0,9), meaning that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nLet the actions be from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, at time H, we are at y_H.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter first action (at t=0), we go to y_1, and so on, up to after action at t=H-1, we go to y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nAnd for each time from t=0 to t=H-1, when we are at y_t, if y_t in 1-8, no collision.\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t, and we choose action a_t, then at t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t in 1-8 and car on row y_t has 0 in span at time t.\n\nAt time t, it is turn t1 + t.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, but for each row, I need the times when x=0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nThen, to avoid collision, when the player is on that row at time t, it must not be one of those times.\n\nNow, let's list for each row, the cars and their span coverage at time t.\n\nFirst, row y=1: only one car? Freeway 1 has one car: tail_0 = -83, head_0 = -48, s=36, direction right.\n\nAt time t, span: [ -83 + 36t , -48 + 36t ]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36t <= 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nSo -83 + 36t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t <= 2 since t integer\n\nt is turn, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -48 + 36t => 48 <= 36t => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so t >= 2? Let's see:\n\n0 <= -48 + 36t => 36t >= 48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so since t integer, t >= 2\n\nAnd from first, t <= 2.305, so t <= 2\n\nt >= 2 and t <= 2, so t=2.\n\nAt t=2, -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11, which is <=0\n\n-48 + 36*2 = -48 + 72 = 24, which >=0, so 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nAt t=1: -83+36= -47 <=0, -48+36= -12 <=0? -12 <=0, but 0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 is false, since -12 <0, so not satisfied.\n\nAt t=1, -48 +36t = -48+36= -12, which is less than 0, so 0 <= -12 is false, so 0 not in span.\n\nAt t=3: -83+108=25 >0? -83+36*3= -83+108=25>0, so -83+36t=25>0, so lower bound >0, so 0 not <= 25? 0 <=25 true, but lower bound 25>0, so 0 not in [25, something], head: -48+108=60, so [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, only t=2.\n\nSo for row 1, collision at t=2 only.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: same as row 1, since same car, so collision only at t=2.\n\nRow 3: same, collision only at t=2.\n\nNow row 4: freeway 4, car: tail=-71, head=-48, s=24\n\n0 in span if -71 +24t <=0 <= -48 +24t\n\nFirst: -71+24t <=0 => 24t <=71 => t <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so t<=2? 71/24=2.958, so t<=2 since t integer? t<=2.958, so t=0,1,2,3? t integer, t<=2.958 means t<=2? 24*2=48<71, 24*3=72>71.\n\n-71 +24t <=0 => 24t <=71 => t <= 71/24 = 2.958, so for t integer, t <=2? At t=2, -71+48= -23 <=0, true. At t=3, -71+72=1>0, false? 1>0, so -71+24t <=0 only if t<=2.958, so t=0,1,2? t=0: -71<=0 true, t=1: -71+24=-47<=0 true, t=2: -71+48=-23<=0 true, t=3: -71+72=1>0, false. So t<=2 for first inequality.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 +24t => 24t >=48 => t>=2.\n\nSo t>=2 and t<=2, so t=2.\n\nAt t=2, -71+48= -23 <=0, and -48+48=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt t=1: -71+24= -47 <=0, but 0 <= -48+24= -24? 0 <= -24 false, so not.\n\nAt t=3: 0 <= -48+72=24 true, but -71+72=1>0, so lower bound 1>0, 0 not in [1,24].\n\nSo only t=2 for row 4.\n\nSimilarly row 5 and 6 same, only collision at t=2.\n\nNow row 7: freeway 7 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) so head=48, tail=37, s=4? (h,τ,d,s) = (48,37,right,4), so head=48, tail=37, s=4.\n\nAt time t, span [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\n0 in this? 37+4t <=0 <=48+4t? But 37+4t >=37>0 for t>=0, so lower bound >0, so 0 not in [37+4t,48+4t] for any t, since min at t=0 is 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), tail=1, head=12, s=4\n\nSpan [1 + 4t, 12 + 4t]\n\n0 in this? 1+4t <=0 <=12+4t\n\n1+4t <=0? 4t <= -1, impossible since t>=0, 1+4t >=1>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), tail=-35, head=-24, s=4\n\nSpan [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4t <=0 <= -24 +4t\n\nFirst inequality: -35+4t <=0 => 4t <=35 => t <= 35/4 = 8.75, so t<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +4t => 4t >=24 => t>=6\n\nSo t>=6 and t<=8.75, so t=6,7,8\n\nAt t=6: -35+24= -11 <=0, -24+24=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so 0 in.\n\nt=7: -35+28= -7 <=0, -24+28=4 >=0, 0 in [-7,4]\n\nt=8: -35+32= -3 <=0, -24+32=8 >=0, 0 in [-3,8]\n\nt=5: -35+20= -15 <=0, but 0 <= -24+20= -4? 0<= -4 false, not in.\n\nt=9: -35+36=1>0, so not <=0, and head -24+36=12>0, but lower bound >0.\n\nSo for row 7, collision when t=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, for row 8, same as row 7, since same cars, collision at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, row y=1 to 6: collision only at t=2? Rows 1,2,3 have collision at t=2, rows 4,5,6 also at t=2, as per above.\n\nRow 4,5,6: same as row 4 car, only t=2.\n\nAnd rows 7 and 8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, y=9 has no cars, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we need to increase y from 0 to 9, at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or go down, but that would increase turns, so minimal should be 9 turns if we go up every time, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nWith collisions, we might need to wait or go down at some points.\n\nFirst, the collision times:\n\n- For rows 1-6, dangerous at t=2 only.\n\n- Rows 7-8 dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nSince rows 1-6 all have danger only at t=2, and same for all, so if we are on any of y=1 to 6 at t=2, we crash, except if we are not on that row, but since danger is at same time, we need to not be on rows 1-6 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, if we are on y=1,2,3,4,5, or 6, we crash because for that row, at t=2, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6,7,8, if on y=7 or 8, crash.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we must pass through each row, but we can delay or skip rows by moving faster or slower.\n\nThe player moves at most one step per turn, so we have to visit intermediate rows.\n\nWe need to plan the path so that at t=2, we are not on rows 1-6, and at t=6,7,8 we are not on rows 7-8.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are all dangerous at t=2, we need to be either below 1 or above 6 at t=2.\n\nBelow 1: y=0 or y<0, but y min 0, so y=0.\n\nAbove 6: y=7,8,9.\n\nBut at t=2, we might not be at y=7 or above yet, since we start from y=0.\n\nSimilarly, for t=6,7,8, need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo possible to be below 7 or above 8, i.e., y<=6 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, let's think about the timeline.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 1-6 at t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, we must be at y=0 or y>=7.\n\nBut y=0 at t=2: that means we didn't move up for the first two turns.\n\ny=0 at t=0.\n\nAfter action at t=0, to y1.\n\nAt t=1, we are at y1.\n\nThen action at t=1, to y2.\n\nAt t=2, we are at y2.\n\nWe need y2 = 0 or y2 >=7.\n\nIf y2=0, that means we stayed at y=0 or moved down, but y=0, if we move down, y<0 not allowed, so at y=0, we can only stay or move up.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, we choose a_0: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y1 =1\n\nIf S, y1=0\n\nIf D, y1 = -1, but y min 0, so y1=0, I think. The player update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=0 and D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, similarly at y=9 and U, y=9.\n\nSo actions: at y=0, D has no effect, y stays 0; similarly S stays; U moves to 1.\n\nSimilarly at y=9.\n\nSo at t=0, y=0:\n\n- If a_0 = U, then y1=1\n\n- If a_0 = S or D, y1=0\n\nThen at t=1, y=y1\n\nIf y1=0, then at t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen choose a_1: if U, y2=1; if S or D, y2=0\n\nIf y1=1, then at t=1, on row 1, which is freeway, so need to check collision at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, for row 1: earlier we saw no collision at t=1, only at t=2 for rows 1-6.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nAt t=1, for row 1: span [-83+36*1, -48+36*1] = [-47, -12], both negative, so 0 not in, since -12 <0.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 at t=1: [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nRow 7 at t=1: for the dangerous car, third one, at t=1, [-35+4, -24+4] = [-31,-20], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=1, all rows are safe, no collision possible at t=1 for any row.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, y=0 safe.\n\nt=1: if on freeway, safe.\n\nBack to t=2.\n\nWe need y2 not in {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n\nSo y2=0 or y2=7,8,9.\n\nBut y2=9 might be hard to reach by t=2.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=2, we have two moves.\n\nStart y0=0.\n\nAfter two actions, y2.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\n- U,U: y1=1, y2=2\n\n- U,S: y1=1, y2=1\n\n- U,D: y1=1, y2=0 (since at y=1, D to 0)\n\n- S,U: y1=0, y2=1\n\n- S,S: y1=0, y2=0\n\n- S,D: y1=0, y2=0\n\n- D,U: same as S,U, y1=0, y2=1 (since at y=0, D same as S)\n\n- D,S: y1=0, y2=0\n\n- D,D: y1=0, y2=0\n\nSo possible y2: 0,1, or 2.\n\nCannot reach y=3 or above in two steps.\n\ny2=0,1,2.\n\nBut we need y2=0 or >=7, but 7 not possible, so only option is y2=0.\n\nThus, at t=2, we must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nSo y2=0.\n\nThis means we did not move up in the first two turns.\n\nSpecifically, from above, to have y2=0, we need to not move up at t=0 or t=1, but if we move up at t=0, we go to y1=1, then to get y2=0, we must do D at t=1, which is possible.\n\nOr if we do S or D at t=0, y1=0, then S or D at t=1, y2=0.\n\nBut if we do U at t=0 and D at t=1, we go to y1=1 then y2=0.\n\nIn this case, at t=1, we are at y=1, which is freeway, but at t=1, no collision as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at 0 both times.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually, so staying at 0 doesn't help.\n\nBut for now, at t=2, we must be at y=0.\n\nSo we set actions such that y2=0.\n\nFor example, a0: S, a1: S, then y2=0.\n\nOr a0: S, a1: D, same y2=0.\n\nOr a0: U, a1: D, then y1=1, y2=0.\n\nAll fine.\n\nNow, after t=2, we need to go up.\n\nBut we also have dangers at t=6,7,8 for rows 7-8.\n\nt=2 is done, we are at y=0 at t=2.\n\nNow, from t=2 onwards, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe next danger is at t=6,7,8 for y=7 and 8.\n\nAt t=6,7,8, if on y=7 or 8, crash.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at t=6, t=7, t=8.\n\nWe can be on y<=6 or y=9 at those times.\n\nt=2: y=0.\n\nWe have time from t=2 to t=6, which is 4 turns: actions at t=2,3,4,5 to set positions at t=3,4,5,6.\n\nAt time t=6, we need y6 not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly for t=7 and t=8.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at t=2, and need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves, but we have constraints.\n\nLet me list the times and required positions.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- At t=6: y6 not in {7,8}\n\n- At t=7: y7 not in {7,8}\n\n- At t=8: y8 not in {7,8}\n\nAnd at other times, we need to be safe when on freeway, but since only dangers are at t=2 (avoided) and t=6,7,8 for y=7,8, and for other times and rows, no danger, so as long as we avoid those, we are fine.\n\nFor example, row 1-6 only danger at t=2, which we avoided by not being on them.\n\nSimilarly, row 7-8 danger at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt other times, no cars cover x=0, so safe.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo we just need to navigate from t=2, y=0 to some t, y=9, avoiding being on y=7 or 8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, let's see the position over time.\n\nSet t=2 as a new start, but time is absolute.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut with constraints at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6 is 4 steps from t=2: from t=2 to t=6, actions at t=2,3,4,5 affect positions t=3,4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, t=7 is position after action at t=6, etc.\n\nLet me denote the actions from now.\n\nWe need to choose actions for t=2,3,4,... up to when we reach y=9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should go up as fast as possible, but with constraints.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=6: 4 actions, we can increase y by at most 4, so at t=6, y6 <= 4, since start y2=0.\n\ny2=0.\n\nAfter action at t=2: to y3\n\nAt t=3: y3\n\nAction at t=3: to y4\n\nAt t=4: y4\n\nAction at t=4: to y5\n\nAt t=5: y5\n\nAction at t=5: to y6\n\nAt t=6: y6\n\nSimilarly, action at t=6 to y7, etc.\n\ny6 <= y2 + 4 = 4, since each action can increase by at most 1.\n\nSimilarly, y6 >=0.\n\nBut since we go up, probably y6 >= something.\n\nNow, at t=6, y6 must not be 7 or 8, but since y6 <=4, it cannot be 7 or 8, so automatically satisfied.\n\ny6 <=4, which is less than 7, so y6 <=6 easily, so not 7 or 8, so at t=6, we are safe, no problem.\n\nThen at t=7: y7 must not be 7 or 8.\n\ny7 is set by action at t=6 from y6.\n\ny6 <=4, so y7 = y6 + Δy, with |Δy|<=1, so y7 <=5.\n\nSimilarly, y7 <=5 <7, so cannot be 7 or 8, so also automatically satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8: y8 must not be 7 or 8.\n\ny8 <= y7 +1 <=6.\n\nStill y8 <=6 <7, so cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nThus, since we are below y=7 at t=6,7,8, we are safe from the row 7-8 dangers.\n\nAnd we can just go up directly to y=9.\n\nWe start from t=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so 9 actions.\n\nWith actions from t=2 to t=10, we can have y at t=11 be 9, or earlier?\n\nTime: at t=2, y=0.\n\nAfter action at t=2: to y3\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=k: to y_{k+1}\n\nWe want y_H =9 for some H.\n\nAt time H, position y_H.\n\nH is the time when we are at y=9.\n\nFrom t=2 to H, we have H-2 actions? Let's index properly.\n\nSet τ = t - 2, so at τ=0, y=0.\n\nThen after actions at τ=0,1,2,..., up to when y_τ =9 at some τ.\n\ny_τ means at time t=2+τ, position y.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action at τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nWe want y_K =9 for some K, with K minimal.\n\nNumber of actions is K.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nTo increase from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 U, and no D or S, so minimal K=9.\n\nWith K=9, y_9=9.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter 9 U, at τ=9, y=9.\n\nTime: τ from 0 to 9, 10 positions, 9 actions.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=9, we have 9 actions.\n\ny at τ=0:0, after action 0: y1, ..., after action 8: y9.\n\nWe want y9=9.\n\nWith all U, y1=1, y2=2, ..., y9=9.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nPositions: at time τ, y_τ.\n\nBut time τ corresponds to absolute time t=2+τ.\n\nNow, for collision, at time t=2+τ, if y_τ in 1-8, and car at that row covers x=0 at time t=2+τ.\n\nNow, for rows 1-6, danger only at t=2+τ when 2+τ=2, so τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y_τ = y0 =0, which is not in 1-8, so safe.\n\nFor rows 7-8, danger at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 correspond to τ such that 2+τ=6, so τ=4; t=7, τ=5; t=8, τ=6.\n\nSo at τ=4,5,6, if on y=7 or 8, crash.\n\nBut in the all-up path:\n\ny at τ=0: 0\n\nτ=1:1\n\nτ=2:2\n\nτ=3:3\n\nτ=4:4\n\nτ=5:5\n\nτ=6:6\n\nτ=7:7\n\nτ=8:8\n\nτ=9:9\n\nAt τ=4 (t=6), y=4, which is row 4, but at t=6, for row 4, is there danger? Earlier we saw for row 4, only danger at t=2, at t=6 no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for row 5,6, no danger except t=2.\n\nAt t=6, row 7 and 8 have danger, but at τ=4, y=4, not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nAt τ=5 (t=7), y=5, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nAt τ=6 (t=8), y=6, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nThen at τ=7 (t=9), y=7, now row 7, but at t=9, for row 7, is there danger?\n\nEarlier, row 7 danger at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=9: for the third car, at t=9, span [-35 + 4*9, -24 + 4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], both >0, so 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for other cars on row 7, at t=9, first car: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84]>0, not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48]>0, not.\n\nSo at t=9, row 7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 same.\n\nThen y=8 at τ=8 (t=10), similarly, at t=10, row 8: cars, e.g., third car [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16]>0, no cover 0.\n\nSafe.\n\ny=9 at τ=9 (t=11) safe.\n\nSo with all up moves starting from t=2, we can reach y=9 at t=11, with H=11 - t1? t1=68, but we need the time from start.\n\nAbsolute: at turn t1 + t, with t from 0.\n\nWe have t=0: y=0\n\nt=1: depending on action, but we need to set y2=0.\n\nFor example, to have y2=0, we can do different actions at t=0 and t=1.\n\nBut for minimal H, we should not waste time, so at t=0 and t=1, we should do actions that allow us to move up later.\n\nBut since we need to stay at y=0 at t=2, we must not move up at both or move down.\n\nBut to save time, we can do, for example, at t=0: S or D, and t=1: S or D, so y1=0, y2=0.\n\nOr at t=0: U, then t=1: D, so y1=1, y2=0.\n\nIn the first case, we stay at 0 both turns, no progress.\n\nIn the second case, we go to 1 and back to 0, also no progress, but we used two turns to be at 0 at t=2.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, both cases waste two turns.\n\nIn the all-up from t=2, we need 9 actions to go from 0 to 9, so from t=2 to t=10, with y11=9? Let's see absolute time.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + t\n\nt=0: T=68, y=0\n\nt=1: T=69, y1\n\nt=2: T=70, y2\n\n...\n\nWe need y at some time.\n\nSet actions from t=0 to H-1, reach y_H at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nStart at t=0, y0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H.\n\nWith all up, y_H = min(9, number of U), but need exactly 9 U.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nIn this case, we need to have y2=0.\n\nSo from t=0 to t=1, actions to set y2=0.\n\nFor example, option 1: a_{68} = S, a_{69} = S, then y at T=69: y1=0 (after action at 68), at T=70: y2=0.\n\nThen from T=70, y=0, we start going up.\n\nAfter action at T=70: to y at T=71, etc.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nWith all U from T=70: action at 70: U, y at 71:1\n\n71: U, y72:2\n\n72: U, y73:3\n\n73: U, y74:4\n\n74: U, y75:5\n\n75: U, y76:6\n\n76: U, y77:7\n\n77: U, y78:8\n\n78: U, y79:9\n\nSo at T=79, y=9.\n\nH: from t=0 to H-1, actions at T=68 to 78, that's 11 actions? T=68 to 78 inclusive is 11 turns: 68,69,70,...,78.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=68 to T=78, that's 11 actions? Let's see: actions at T=68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78, that's 11 actions, reaching y at T=79.\n\nBut T=79 is turn t1 + H, since t1=68, T=68 + H.\n\nAfter H actions, time is t1 + H.\n\nStart: at T=68, before action, y=0.\n\nAction at T=68: after, y at T=69.\n\n...\n\nAction at T=68+H-1: after, y at T=68+H.\n\nWe want y at T=68+H to be 9.\n\nIn the sequence: if we do actions from T=68 to T=78, that's H=11 actions, y at T=79=9.\n\nBut we can do better?\n\nEarlier I thought with the move to 1 and back.\n\nFor example: at T=68: U, then at T=69: y=1\n\nThen at T=69: D, then at T=70: y=0\n\nNow at T=70, y=0, same as before.\n\nThen from here, we go up, same as above, actions at T=70 to 78: U each, to y at T=71:1, T=72:2, ..., T=79:9.\n\nBut actions: T=68: U, T=69: D, then T=70 to 78: U, that's 10 U and one D, but y at T=79:9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=68 to T=78, 11 actions still? T=68,69,70,71,...,78: 11 actions.\n\nList: actions at: 68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78 → 11 actions, y at 79=9.\n\nCompared to first option: if we stay at 0: T=68: S, T=69: S, T=70: y=0, then T=70 to 78: U, actions at T=68,69,70,71,...,78: same 11 actions.\n\nBut in the move to 1 and back, we have y at T=69:1, which is freeway, but at t=1, no collision, as we saw earlier.\n\nBut still 11 actions.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nSince at t=2 we must be at 0, and we need to go to 9, minimal 9 moves up, so from t=2 onwards, at least 9 actions, plus the first two actions to stay at 0, so total 11 actions minimal? Not necessarily, because in the first two actions, if we do U then D, we have one net up and down, but end at 0, so we used two actions to stay, same as S S.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier if possible, but at t=2 we need to be at 0, so we cannot be higher.\n\nUnless we can be at y>=7 at t=2, but impossible in two steps.\n\nSo yes, minimal H is 11, with y at T=79=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have collision-free path.\n\nBut in the up path from t=2, at T=77, y=7, and T=77 is t=77-68=9, τ=9? Absolute t from t1=68.\n\nT=77, t=77-68=9.\n\ny=7 at t=9.\n\nNow, row 7 at t=9: as above, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the path with U and D at start: actions:\n\nTurn t1=68: a_{68} = U\n\nThen at T=69, y=1\n\nTurn t1+1=69: a_{69} = D, then at T=70, y=0\n\nThen Turn 70: a_{70} = U, to y71=1\n\n71: U, y72=2\n\n72: U, y73=3\n\n73: U, y74=4\n\n74: U, y75=5\n\n75: U, y76=6\n\n76: U, y77=7\n\n77: U, y78=8\n\n78: U, y79=9\n\nSo actions from turn 68 to 78.\n\nH=11 actions, reach at turn 79.\n\nWe can have a sequence with S at start.\n\nBut same number.\n\nIs there a way with less than 11?\n\nSuppose we go up immediately after t=2.\n\nBut we need 9 steps from 0 to 9, so from t=2 at 0, to t=11 at 9, with actions from t=2 to t=10? Let's see minimal time.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=2+k.\n\nSet k such that y_{2+k} =9.\n\nMinimal k=9, with all U, y_{2+1}=1, ..., y_{2+9}=9.\n\nSo at time t=11, y=9.\n\nt=11 is T=68+11=79.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=10, that is actions at T=70 to 78, but we need to include the first actions.\n\nTotal actions from t=0 to t=10? t from 0 to 10 inclusive for actions? Actions at times t=0,1,2,...,10, that's 11 actions, y at t=11.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we can reach faster by being at higher y earlier, but at t=2 we must be at 0, so no.\n\nPerhaps we can go down or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from turn t1=68.\n\nIn the above, with U at 68, D at 69, then U from 70 to 78.\n\nBut at turn 69, we do D, from y=1 to y=0.\n\nWe can do S at 68 and S at 69, then U from 70 to 78.\n\nSame H.\n\nBut in the U then D, we have an extra move but same number of actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need a sequence.\n\nBut we need to make sure that during the path, no collision except avoided.\n\nIn this path:\n\nAt T=68: action U, then position at T=69: y=1\n\nAt T=69, on row 1, time t=1 (since t1=68, T=69 is t=1), at t=1, row 1: as before, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=69: action D, position at T=70: y=0, safe.\n\nThen T=70: action U, position at T=71: y=1\n\nAt T=71, t=3, y=1, row 1: at t=3, for row 1, cars: span [-83+36*3, -48+36*3]= [-83+108, -48+108]= [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=72: y=2, t=4, row 2: similarly, cars at t=4: [-83+144, -48+144]= [61,96]? 36*4=144, -83+144=61, -48+144=96, yes, 0 not in.\n\n...\n\nUp to T=76: y=6, t=8, row 6: at t=8, for row 6 car: tail=-71, head=-48, s=24, at t=8: [-71+192, -48+192]= [121,144], 0 not in.\n\nT=77: y=7, t=9, row 7: at t=9, as before, no car at x=0.\n\nT=78: y=8, t=10, row 8: similarly safe.\n\nT=79: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from turn 68 to 78.\n\nBut turn 78 is t1 + 10, since t1=68, t=0 to 10.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nThe sequence: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 10.\n\na_{68} = U\n\na_{69} = D\n\na_{70} = U\n\na_{71} = U\n\na_{72} = U\n\na_{73} = U\n\na_{74} = U\n\na_{75} = U\n\na_{76} = U\n\na_{77} = U\n\na_{78} = U\n\nBut at a_{69}=D, from y=1 to y=0.\n\nWe can have a sequence without down move.\n\nFor example: a_{68} = S\n\na_{69} = S\n\nThen a_{70} to a_{78} all U.\n\na_{68}=S: at T=69, y=0\n\na_{69}=S: at T=70, y=0\n\nThen a_{70}=U: T=71 y=1\n\n...\n\na_{78}=U: T=79 y=9\n\nSame actions, 11.\n\nBut in this case, at T=69, y=0, not on freeway, and T=70 y=0.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut the down move is fine too.\n\nNow, for minimal H, it's the same.\n\nBut perhaps we can start going up earlier if we can avoid the t=2 danger differently, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: since rows 1-6 are only dangerous at t=2, and we are not on them at t=2, we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, if we go up slowly, but that might take more turns.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so faster is better.\n\nIn this case, with H=11, it works.\n\nBut is H=10 possible?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at T=78.\n\nThat means y at T=78=9.\n\nAt T=78, which is t=78-68=10.\n\ny at t=10 must be 9.\n\nBut we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=9 in 10 steps, we need 9 up moves and one other move, but since we must have y2=0, it constrains.\n\nSuppose we do all up from beginning except at t=1 we do something.\n\nBut at t=2, y must be 0.\n\nIf at t=0: U, y1=1\n\nt=1: must have y2=0, so we must do D at t=1, y2=0.\n\nThen from t=2, y=0, we need to reach y=9 in 8 steps? From t=2 to t=10.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y at t=10.\n\nWith all U, y at t=10 would be 8, not 9.\n\ny at time: after 8 actions from t=2, actions at t=2 to t=9, positions t=3 to t=10.\n\ny at t=10 = y after 8 actions from t=2.\n\nStart y2=0.\n\nAfter action at t=2: y3\n\n...\n\nAction at t=9: y10\n\nWith all U: y3=1, y4=2, ..., y10=8.\n\nBut we need y10=9.\n\nTo get y10=9, we need one more up move, so we need 9 up moves from t=2, but that would take to y11=9.\n\nIf we do 9 up moves from t=2, actions at t=2 to t=10, y at t=3 to t=11.\n\ny11=9.\n\nBut t=11 is later.\n\nIf we have a down move somewhere, we need extra up moves.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=10 with y2=0.\n\nBecause from y=0 at t=2, to y=9 at t=10, that's 8 steps, maximal increase 8, so y<=8 at t=10.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, if we want y at t=9 to be 9, but t=9 is earlier.\n\ny at t=9: from y2=0 at t=2, after 7 actions, y at t=9 <=7.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSo minimal is y at t=11=9, with actions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nThus H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence with U and D, or with S S.\n\nBut perhaps we should avoid unnecessary moves, but since minimal H is fixed, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the U then D sequence, we have a down move, which might be considered, but it's fine.\n\nTo make it cleaner, we can do S S then all U.\n\nBut S is stay, same as D at y=0.\n\nIn terms of action, D at y=0 is same as S.\n\nNow, another thing: at the beginning, when we do U at t=0 to y=1 at t=1, and t=1 is safe, but row 1 has cars, but at t=1, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do the S S approach.\n\nBut let's see the car states.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we already checked.\n\nIn the sequence, for row 7 and 8, at t=6,7,8 dangerous, but in our path, we are at y=4,5,6 at t=6,7,8, which are below, so safe.\n\nt=6: y=4, t=7:y=5, t=8:y=6.\n\nAll below 7.\n\nAnd at t=9:y=7, which is safe.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nSince the player starts at (0,0), and we need to go to (0,9), with actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with all U except the first two set to have y2=0.\n\nBut we need to write the actions for each turn.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving up at t=2 immediately.\n\nIn the S S then U U ... sequence.\n\nBut let's write the sequence for the U D version.\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: D\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nAfter action at 78, position at 79: y=9.\n\nH=11, from t=0 to t=10.\n\nt from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H - 1: a_{t_1 + H - 1}\n\nWith y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nHere t_1=68, H=11, so actions from turn 68 to 78.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 68 + 11 -1 = 78.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can have a sequence without D.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 68: S\n\nTurn 69: S\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nThen at turn 79: y=9.\n\nSame thing.\n\nIn this case, at turn 69, position y=0, not freeway.\n\nTurn 70 action U, to y=1 at 71, etc.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nPerhaps the S S is simpler.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"avoiding collisions\", and in the U D, we were on row 1 at t=1, but safe, so no issue.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any other constraint?\n\nThe car on freeway 4, etc., but we think it's fine.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only dangerous at t=2, and we avoid being on them at t=2, we can be on them at other times, which we are in the path.\n\nSimilarly for 7-8.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach earlier by going faster after t=2, but no, we go max speed.\n\nPerhaps if we go up during the first two turns but manage to not be on dangerous row at t=2, but impossible since y=1 or 2 at t=2, which are dangerous.\n\nSo must be at 0.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nI think we can output the S S then U all.\n\nOr U D then U all.\n\nBut in U D, we have a down move, which might be odd, but valid.\n\nTo avoid down, we can do S S.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, the action names: U, D, S.\n\nIn the output.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have three cars each, but we considered.\n\nAnother thing: the collision definition: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd Span(T) is at that turn.\n\nIn our case, covered.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 68: S\n\nTurn 69: S\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nAfter this, at turn 79, y=9.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nBut the actions are from turn 68 to 78.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 68 to turn 78.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 68: S  \nTurn 69: S  \nTurn 70: U  \nTurn 71: U  \nTurn 72: U  \nTurn 73: U  \nTurn 74: U  \nTurn 75: U  \nTurn 76: U  \nTurn 77: U  \nTurn 78: U  \n}\n\nBut this is for H=11, actions 11.\n\nTo make sure, with this, at turn 68: action S, position at 69: y=0\n\nTurn 69: action S, position at 70: y=0\n\nTurn 70: action U, position at 71: y=1\n\nTurn 71: U, position at 72: y=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 78: U, position at 79: y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAt position at turn 71: y=1, turn=71, t=71-68=3, row 1, safe as before.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe can start with U then D.\n\nBut I think S S is fine.\n\nIn the U D sequence:\n\nTurn 68: U  (to y=1 at 69)\n\nTurn 69: D  (to y=0 at 70)\n\nThen same as above from turn 70.\n\nBut turn 69 action D, which is fine.\n\nBut perhaps S is simpler.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nNow for the final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 68\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Collision Times\n- **Rows \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\)**: Each has one car with initial tail at -83, head at -48, speed 36, moving right. Collision occurs at \\(T - t_1 = 2\\) (i.e., absolute turn \\(T = 70\\)) if the player is on the row at that turn.\n- **Rows \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\)**: Each has one car with initial tail at -71, head at -48, speed 24, moving right. Collision occurs at \\(T - t_1 = 2\\) (absolute turn \\(T = 70\\)) if the player is on the row.\n- **Rows \\(y = 7, 8\\)**: Each has three cars:\n  - Car 1: Tail 37, head 48, speed 4, moving right. Never covers x=0.\n  - Car 2: Tail 1, head 12, speed 4, moving right. Never covers x=0.\n  - Car 3: Tail -35, head -24, speed 4, moving right. Collision occurs at \\(T - t_1 = 6, 7, 8\\) (absolute turns \\(T = 74, 75, 76\\)) if the player is on the row.\n- **No collisions** at other times or on other rows (y=0 and y=9 are safe).\n\n### Constraints\n- At turn \\(T = 70\\) (\\(t = 2\\)), the player must not be on rows 1–6 to avoid collision. Given the starting position and movement constraints, the only feasible position at \\(T = 70\\) is \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turns \\(T = 74, 75, 76\\) (\\(t = 6, 7, 8\\)), the player must not be on rows 7–8 to avoid collision.\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\n- From turn 68 to 69, actions must ensure \\(y = 0\\) at turn 70. Options:\n  - Stay (S) at both turns: \\(y_{69} = 0\\), \\(y_{70} = 0\\).\n  - Move up (U) then down (D): \\(y_{69} = 1\\), \\(y_{70} = 0\\).\n- Both options use 2 turns to reach \\(y = 0\\) at turn 70, with no progress toward y=9.\n- From turn 70 (\\(y = 0\\)), the player can move up directly to y=9 in 9 turns (since each U increases y by 1, and no delays are needed).\n- Minimal total turns: 2 turns (to stay at y=0) + 9 turns (to reach y=9) = 11 turns.\n- With this, at turns 74, 75, 76 (\\(t = 6, 7, 8\\)), the player is at y=4, 5, 6 (below 7), avoiding rows 7–8 collisions.\n- All other positions are safe, as collisions only occur at the specified times.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turns 68–69**: Stay at y=0 to satisfy \\(y_{70} = 0\\) constraint (using S actions).\n- **Turns 70–78**: Move up (U) each turn to reach y=9 at turn 79.\n\nActions:\n- Turn 68: S (stay at y=0 for turn 69)\n- Turn 69: S (stay at y=0 for turn 70)\n- Turn 70: U (move to y=1 at turn 71)\n- Turn 71: U (move to y=2 at turn 72)\n- Turn 72: U (move to y=3 at turn 73)\n- Turn 73: U (move to y=4 at turn 74)\n- Turn 74: U (move to y=5 at turn 75)\n- Turn 75: U (move to y=6 at turn 76)\n- Turn 76: U (move to y=7 at turn 77)\n- Turn 77: U (move to y=8 at turn 78)\n- Turn 78: U (move to y=9 at turn 79)\n\nThis sequence reaches (0, 9) at turn 79 (\\(t_1 + 11\\)) with 11 actions, which is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 68: S \\\\  \nTurn 69: S \\\\  \nTurn 70: U \\\\  \nTurn 71: U \\\\  \nTurn 72: U \\\\  \nTurn 73: U \\\\  \nTurn 74: U \\\\  \nTurn 75: U \\\\  \nTurn 76: U \\\\  \nTurn 77: U \\\\  \nTurn 78: U  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 70 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision rule is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn, then there's a collision. Importantly, when you move to a new y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and if you move, you'll be on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=70, and they move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at turn 70, and then I need to figure out where they are at future turns.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: one car, head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, the head is at the front, so at turn 70, span is [τ, h] = [-83, -48]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so as time increases, both head and tail increase by s per turn.\n\nThe update rule: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving.\n\ny=1: car with tail τ = -83, head h = -48? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\", so [tail, head] meaning tail is left, head is right since moving right.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor y=1: head h = -48, tail τ = -83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSince direction right, at time t, the car is moving right, so tail should be smaller number if x-axis is increasing to the right? I need to assume the coordinate system.\n\nTypically, x=0 is the player's position, and cars are on the x-axis, with x decreasing to the left, increasing to the right.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, at turn t1, span is [τ, h], so if τ = -83, h = -48, that means tail at x=-83, head at x=-48, so the car extends from x=-83 to x=-48, and since it's moving right, both ends increase with speed s.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and 0 is within the car's span on that freeway, meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince span is an interval, 0 in [min, max].\n\nNow for freeway 1: at t1=70, span = [τ, h] = [-83, -48], so min = -83, max = -48, both negative, so 0 not in span at t=70.\n\nAs time increases, both min and max increase by s*Δt.\n\ns=36, so per turn, min and max increase by 36.\n\nSo at turn T, min = -83 + 36*(T-70)\n\nMax = -48 + 36*(T-70)\n\n0 is in span when min <= 0 <= max, so -83 + 36*(T-70) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-70)\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36*(T-70) <= 0 => 36*(T-70) <= 83 => T-70 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T <= 72.305, so T <= 72 since turn integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-70) => 48 <= 36*(T-70) => T-70 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T >= 71.333, thus T >= 72.\n\nT-70 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T >= 72 since T integer? T-70 >= 1.333, so T >= 72? 70 + 1.333 = 71.333, so ceil to 72? Let's be careful.\n\nT-70 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, since T integer, T-70 >= 2? No, T-70 must be at least 2 for the inequality to hold? Let's see:\n\n0 <= -48 + 36*(T-70) when 36*(T-70) >= 48, so T-70 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333. Since T integer, T-70 must be at least 2? No, for example T=71: T-70=1, 36*1=36 <48? 36<48, so -48 +36 = -12 <0, so 0 <= -12 is false.\n\nT=72: T-70=2, 36*2=72, -48+72=24>0, so 0 <=24 true.\n\nSimilarly, first inequality: -83 +36*(T-70) <=0 => 36*(T-70) <=83, T-70 <=83/36≈2.305, so for T=70,71,72: T=70: -83 <=0 true, T=71: -83+36= -47<=0 true, T=72: -83+72= -11<=0 true, T=73: -83+108=25>0 false.\n\nSo min <=0 for T-70 <=2, i.e., T<=72\n\nAnd max >=0 for T-70 >=2, i.e., T>=72? From above: max >=0 when T>=72\n\nAt T=72, min=-83+72= -11? T-70=2, min= -83 + 36*2 = -83+72= -11 <=0, max= -48+72=24>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt T=71: min= -83+36= -47 <=0, max= -48+36= -12 <0, so max=-12<0, so 0 not in [-47,-12], since both negative.\n\nAt T=73: min= -83+108=25>0, max=24? -48+108=60>0, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=72, 0 is in span for freeway y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways with same cars.\n\ny=2: same as y=1? Cars: (-48, -83, right, 36), same as y=1. So identical to y=1, so collision only at T=72.\n\ny=3: also (-48, -83, right, 36), same.\n\ny=4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-71, right, s=24.\n\nAt t1=70, span=[τ,h]=[-71,-48]\n\nAt T, min= -71 +24*(T-70)\n\nMax= -48 +24*(T-70)\n\n0 in span when min<=0<=max\n\n-71 +24Δt <=0 <= -48 +24Δt, where Δt = T-70\n\nFirst: 24Δt <=71 => Δt <=71/24≈2.958, so Δt<=2, T<=72\n\nSecond: 0<= -48 +24Δt => 24Δt>=48 => Δt>=2, T>=72\n\nAt Δt=2, T=72, min= -71+48= -23<=0, max= -48+48=0>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=71: min=-71+24= -47<=0, max=-48+24= -24<0, 0 not in\n\nAt Δt=3, T=73: min=-71+72=1>0, max=-48+72=24>0, not in.\n\nSo only T=72 for y=4.\n\nSimilarly y=5 and y=6 same as y=4? y=5: (-48,-71,right,24) same, y=6 same.\n\nNow y=7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll speed 4, direction right.\n\nFirst car: head h=48, tail τ=37? Span [τ,h]=[37,48] at t1=70.\n\nMoving right, so at T, min=37 +4*(T-70), max=48 +4*(T-70)\n\n0 in span? min=37+4Δt, at t1=70, min=37>0, and increasing, so min always >0 for T>=70, so 0 never in span for this car. Similarly max=48>0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span [1,12] at t1=70, min=1+4Δt, max=12+4Δt, both >=1>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), head h=-24? Tail τ=-35, head h=-24? Span [τ,h]=[-35,-24] at t1=70.\n\nMin= -35 +4*(T-70), max= -24 +4*(T-70)\n\n0 in span when min<=0<=max\n\n-35 +4Δt <=0 <= -24 +4Δt\n\nFirst: 4Δt <=35 => Δt <=35/4=8.75, so Δt<=8, T<=78\n\nSecond: 0<= -24 +4Δt => 4Δt>=24 => Δt>=6, T>=76\n\nAt Δt=6, T=76: min= -35+24= -11<=0, max= -24+24=0>=0, 0 in span\n\nAt Δt=7, T=77: min= -35+28= -7<=0, max= -24+28=4>=0, 0 in span\n\nAt Δt=8, T=78: min= -35+32= -3<=0, max= -24+32=8>=0, 0 in span\n\nAt Δt=5, T=75: min= -35+20= -15<=0, max= -24+20= -4<0, 0 not in\n\nAt Δt=9, T=79: min= -35+36=1>0, max= -24+36=12>0, not in\n\nSo for third car on y=7, 0 in span at T=76,77,78\n\nNow similarly for other cars on y=7, but first two cars never have 0 in span, so only the third car matters for collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: same cars as y=7: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo identical to y=7, so 0 in span for the third car at T=76,77,78.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at turn 70.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway with cars, so no collision possible on y=0.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and no cars, so once there, no collision.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, we must increase y by 9, so at least 9 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 9.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on a freeway y when at that turn, 0 is in span for any car on that y.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway y, at turn T, if player is on y, and there is a car on y with 0 in its span at T.\n\nNow, from above:\n\nFor y=1,2,3: collision only at T=72\n\ny=4,5,6: collision only at T=72\n\ny=7 and 8: collision at T=76,77,78\n\ny=1,2,3 all have collision only at T=72\n\ny=4,5,6 only at T=72\n\ny=7 and 8 at T=76,77,78\n\nNow, since the player moves vertically, at each turn, we choose to go up, down, or stay, changing y-position.\n\nThe key is to not be on a dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=72, we should not be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6 because all have collision at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, at T=76,77,78, we should not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nWe start at turn 70, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=70 onwards.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nStart: T=70, y=0\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=72 for y=1-6, and T=76,77,78 for y=7-8.\n\nT=72 is only one turn, but for y=7-8, three consecutive turns.\n\nSince we have to go through the freeways, we need to time our movement to avoid these.\n\nFirst, let's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor y=1,2,3: safe except T=72. So safe at all T except 72.\n\nSimilarly for y=4,5,6: safe except T=72.\n\nFor y=7 and 8: safe except T=76,77,78. So unsafe during those three turns, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, since the player moves step by step, we need a sequence of actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but may need to delay or stay to avoid collisions.\n\nStart at T=70, y=0. Since y=0 safe, we can move up immediately or stay, but staying delays, so better to move up to reduce time.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we can stay, but to minimize H, once at y=9, we stop, so we should reach as soon as possible.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nThe critical points are around T=72 and T=76-78.\n\nFirst, from start T=70, y=0.\n\nWe can move up to y=1 at some turn.\n\nBut y=1 is dangerous only at T=72, so if we are on y=1 at T≠72, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, we need to pass through y=1 to y=8.\n\nEach move up increases y by 1.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is 9 if we go up every turn, from y=0 at T=70 to y=9 at T=79? Let's see:\n\nAt T=70, y=0\n\nAfter action at T=70, y_{71} = y_70 + Δy, depending on a_70.\n\nStandard: at turn T, after action a_T, position y_{T+1} is updated.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nThe position is given at turn t, before action.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, player is at y_t, then chooses action a_t, then moves to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and 0 in span for some car on that freeway at turn t.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move to a different y, you are not on the new y until turn T+1.\n\nFor example, if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move up, at turn T you are still on y_T for collision, and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, start at turn t1=70, y=0.\n\ny=0, not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, so that y_T =9.\n\nSince y=9 safe, no issue.\n\nMinimal time: if we go up every turn from T=70 to T=78? Let's compute:\n\nT=70: y=0\n\na_70 = U, then y_71 = 0 +1 =1\n\na_71 = U, y_72 =1+1=2\n\na_72 = U, y_73 =2+1=3\n\na_73 = U, y_74 =3+1=4\n\na_74 = U, y_75 =4+1=5\n\na_75 = U, y_76 =5+1=6\n\na_76 = U, y_77 =6+1=7\n\na_77 = U, y_78 =7+1=8\n\na_78 = U, y_79 =8+1=9\n\nSo at turn T=79, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nNow, at each turn, we need to ensure no collision.\n\nTurn T=70: y=0, safe.\n\nT=71: y=1, now y=1 has cars, and at T=71, is 0 in span?\n\nFor y=1, at T=71: earlier we computed for y=1, at T=71, min=-47, max=-12, both negative, 0 not in span, so safe.\n\nT=72: y=2? In the sequence above, at T=72, y=2.\n\ny=2 has collision at T=72? y=2 has cars same as y=1, and at T=72, 0 in span, as we computed earlier.\n\nSo at T=72, if on y=2, collision occurs.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=72, y=2, and on freeway y=2, at T=72, 0 is in the car span, so collision.\n\nThus, this path has collision at T=72.\n\nSimilarly, if we were on y=1,2,3,4,5,6 at T=72, all have collision.\n\nNow in the direct up path, at T=72, y=2, which is bad.\n\nTo avoid, we need not to be on y=1 to 6 at T=72.\n\nSince we start at T=70, y=0, we need to reach y=9.\n\nWe can delay or advance our movement.\n\nFor example, at T=72, we can be on y=0 or y=7 or above, but y=7 is dangerous later.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=7 at T=72 is safe since y=7 unsafe only at T=76,77,78.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at T=76,77,78.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=72, safe positions: y=0,7,8,9\n\nBut we start at y=0, so we can be at y=0 or move to higher y.\n\nSince we need to go up, we might stay at y=0 for some turns or move slower.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to go as fast as possible, so we should avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, we need to skip T=72 on y=1-6.\n\nSimilarly, later for y=7-8, avoid T=76,77,78.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nFirst, from T=70, we can go up to y=1 at T=71, but at T=71, y=1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at T=71, we are on y=1.\n\nNow, if we go up to y=2 at T=72, but at T=72, y=2 is dangerous.\n\nSo we must not go to y=2 at T=72.\n\nOptions: at T=71, y=1, we can:\n\n- Stay: a_71=S, then y_72 = y_71 =1, but at T=72, y=1 is dangerous, collision.\n\n- Move down: a_71=D, then y_72 = y_71 -1 =1-1=0, so at T=72, y=0, safe.\n\n- Move up: a_71=U, y_72=2, but then at T=72, y=2, collision.\n\nSo only safe option from y=1 at T=71 is to move down to y=0 at T=72, or stay, but stay causes collision, so must move down to avoid.\n\nBut moving down means we lose progress.\n\nThen at T=72, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we can move up later.\n\nBut we wasted a turn.\n\nWe could have stayed at y=0 longer.\n\nStart at T=70, y=0.\n\nInstead of moving up at T=70, we can stay: a_70=S, then y_71=0, still safe.\n\nThen at T=71, y=0, we can move up to y=1.\n\nAt T=71, y=1, which is safe, as before.\n\nNow at T=71, y=1, we need to avoid being on y=1-6 at T=72.\n\nSince T=72 is next, we can move down to y=0 or stay, but staying at y=1 at T=72 is bad.\n\nMove down to y=0.\n\nThen at T=72, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=72, we can start moving up.\n\nBut we lost two turns: stayed or moved down.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster to be above y=6 by T=72.\n\nFrom T=70, y=0.\n\nIf we go up every turn, at T=72, y=2, as before, which is bad.\n\nTo be higher, we need to start earlier or move faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so maximum y at T is y_0 + (T - t1) if we go up each time.\n\nAt T=70, y=0\n\nAfter k up moves, y = k at turn 70 + k? Let's see:\n\nAt turn T, after actions from 70 to T-1.\n\ny_{t} for t >=70.\n\ny_{70} = 0\n\nAfter a_{70}, y_{71} = y_{70} + Δy_{70}\n\nAfter a_{71}, y_{72} = y_{71} + Δy_{71}, and so on.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo have y_T = n, we need at least n up moves from T=70 to T-1 or something.\n\nFrom turn 70 to turn T, the number of actions between 70 and T-1 determine y_T.\n\ny_T = y_{70} + sum_{t=70}^{T-1} Δy_t\n\nSince y_{70}=0, y_T = sum_{t=70}^{T-1} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t = +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo reach y=9, sum must be 9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is when y_T=9 for some T.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach, so from t=70 to t=70+H-1, actions, and at turn t=70+H-1, position should be 9.\n\nLet's define the sequence.\n\nWe have actions from t=70 to t=70+H-1, H actions, and after H actions, we are at turn t=70+H, position y_{70+H} =9.\n\nAt each turn t from 70 to 70+H-1, we are at position y_t, and we need no collision at that turn.\n\nFor t=70, y=0, safe.\n\nThe last turn is t=70+H-1, at position y_{70+H-1}, and after action, y_{70+H} =9.\n\nBut at turn t=70+H-1, we are at y_{70+H-1}, which could be 8 or 9, but since we reach y=9 at turn t=70+H, that means at turn t=70+H-1, we are at some position, and we move to 9.\n\nFor collision, we care about position at each turn t from 70 to 70+H-1, and at that position, no collision with cars on that row at that turn.\n\nAt turn t=70+H, we are at y=9, which is safe, so no issue.\n\nBack to avoiding T=72.\n\nAt T=72, we cannot be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSo we must be on y=0,7,8, or 9 at T=72.\n\nBut at T=70, we are at y=0, so to be at y=7 or above at T=72, we need to go from y=0 to y=7 in two steps? From T=70 to T=72.\n\nAt T=70, y=0\n\nAfter a_70, y_71\n\nAfter a_71, y_72\n\nSo from y_70 to y_72, we can change by at most +2 if both actions up, so y_72 <= 2, cannot reach y=7.\n\nMaximum y at T=72 is 2 if we go up twice.\n\nBut y=2 is dangerous at T=72.\n\ny=0 and y=1 are possible, but y=1 at T=72 is dangerous, so only y=0 is safe at T=72.\n\nTherefore, at T=72, we must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nIs that right?\n\ny=0 is safe, and y=7,8,9 not possible in two steps.\n\nSo yes, to avoid collision at T=72, since we cannot be on safe y except y=0, we must be at y=0 at turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but y=1-6 all dangerous.\n\nSo at turn 72, position must be y=0.\n\nNow, at turn 70, we are at y=0.\n\nSo from turn 70 to turn 72, we need to be at y=0 at turn 72.\n\nHow?\n\nAt turn 70, y=0.\n\nWe can:\n\n- Stay: a_70=S, then y_71 =0\n\nThen at turn 71, y=0, we can stay or move.\n\nIf we stay at turn 71, a_71=S, y_72=0\n\nOr if we move up at turn 71, a_71=U, y_72=1, but then at turn 72, y=1, dangerous.\n\nIf we move down, but y=0, cannot move down, y min 0, so Δy_t cannot be -1 if y_t=0, I assume.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, Δy_t cannot be -1, similarly at y=9, cannot move up.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: S or U, not D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, S or D, not U.\n\nSo at turn 70, y=0, we can:\n\n- a_70 = S: then y_71 = 0\n\n- or a_70 = U: then y_71 = 1\n\nNow, to have y_72=0.\n\nIf at turn 71, y_71=0, then we can do a_71=S, y_72=0\n\nOr if y_71=1, we can do a_71=D, y_72=0\n\nBut if we go to y_71=1, then at turn 71, we are on y=1, which is safe only if not T=72, but T=71, which is safe for y=1, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen at turn 71, y=1, we can move down to y_72=0.\n\nThen at turn 72, y=0, safe.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 both turns, also y_72=0.\n\nBut staying might be slower.\n\nNow, for minimal H, we should not stay if possible.\n\nSo better to go up and then down, but let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, we need to be at y=0 at T=72.\n\nAfter that, we can go up.\n\nBut later there is another dangerous period for y=7 and 8 at T=76,77,78.\n\nFirst, let's handle T=72.\n\nSo at T=72, y=0.\n\nNow, from T=72 onwards, we can start moving up.\n\nAt T=72, y=0, we can move up to y=1 at T=73.\n\na_72=U, then y_73=1\n\nNow, T=73, y=1, is it safe? For y=1, at T=73, cars: min= -83 +36*(73-70)= -83 +36*3= -83+108=25>0, max= -48+108=60>0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other y.\n\nWe can go up continuously until we hit the next danger zone.\n\nNow, the next danger is for y=7 and 8 at T=76,77,78.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at those turns.\n\nNow, let's see when we can reach y=7.\n\nFrom T=72, y=0.\n\nWe go up:\n\nT=72: y=0, action a_72=U, y_73=1\n\nT=73: y=1, action a_73=U, y_74=2\n\nT=74: y=2, action a_74=U, y_75=3\n\nT=75: y=3, action a_75=U, y_76=4\n\nAt T=76, y=4\n\nBut we need to check where we are at dangerous times.\n\nT=76, y=4, but y=4 is not y=7 or 8, so safe, since danger only for y=7,8 at T=76.\n\ny=4 has cars, but at T=76, is it safe?\n\nFor y=4, cars: head -48, tail -71, right, s=24\n\nAt T=76, Δt = T-70=6\n\nmin = -71 +24*6 = -71 +144=73>0\n\nmax= -48 +144=96>0\n\n0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, continue:\n\nT=76: y=4, action a_76=U, y_77=5\n\nT=77: y=5, action a_77=U, y_78=6\n\nT=78: y=6, action a_78=U, y_79=7\n\nNow at T=78, y=6, safe? y=6 at T=78.\n\ny=6 cars: similar to y=4, min= -71 +24*(78-70)= -71 +24*8= -71+192=121>0, max= -48+192=144>0, safe.\n\nThen a_78=U, y_79=7\n\nT=79: y=7, now T=79.\n\nBut the danger for y=7 is at T=76,77,78.\n\nT=79 is after, so for y=7, at T=79, is it safe?\n\ny=7 cars: we have three, but only the third car matters, with span at T=79.\n\nFor the third car, min= -35 +4*(79-70)= -35 +4*9= -35+36=1>0, max= -24+36=12>0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, first and second cars always safe.\n\nSo at T=79, y=7, safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\na_79=U, y_80=8\n\nT=80: y=8\n\nNow y=8 at T=80.\n\nDanger for y=8 at T=76,77,78, T=80 is later.\n\nAt T=80, for y=8 cars, similar to y=7, min= -35 +4*(80-70)= -35+40=5>0, max= -24+40=16>0, safe.\n\nThen a_80=U, y_81=9\n\nT=81: y=9, reached.\n\nBut we started at T=70, ended at T=81, so H=12? Turns from 70 to 80, 11 actions? Let's list the actions.\n\nActions from t=70 to t=80, 11 actions, and at turn t=81, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=11, since from t=70 to t=70+H-1, and y_{70+H}=9.\n\nIn this sequence, we were at y=0 at T=72, but how did we get there?\n\nIn the beginning, we need to set y_72=0.\n\nFrom T=70 to T=72.\n\nAt T=70, y=0\n\nWe need y_72=0.\n\nOne way: stay at T=70 and T=71.\n\na_70=S, y_71=0\n\na_71=S, y_72=0\n\nThen from above, a_72=U, y_73=1\n\na_73=U, y_74=2\n\na_74=U, y_75=3\n\na_75=U, y_76=4\n\na_76=U, y_77=5\n\na_77=U, y_78=6\n\na_78=U, y_79=7\n\na_79=U, y_80=8\n\na_80=U, y_81=9\n\nSo actions: t=70:S, t=71:S, t=72:U, t=73:U, t=74:U, t=75:U, t=76:U, t=77:U, t=78:U, t=79:U, t=80:U\n\n11 actions, reach y=9 at turn 81.\n\nBut H=11, but earlier I thought min 9, but due to delays.\n\nWe could go up and down to be at y=0 at T=72 without staying.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=70, y=0, a_70=U, y_71=1\n\nT=71, y=1, which is safe (since T=71 not 72), then a_71=D, y_72=0\n\nThen at T=72, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, go up from there.\n\nIn this case, actions: t=70:U, t=71:D, then t=72:U, etc., same as above but instead of two S, we have U and D.\n\nBut net progress: from y=0 to y=1 then back to y=0, so we wasted two actions to stay at y=0, same as staying twice.\n\nIn terms of time, same number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, from t=72 to t=80, we go from y=0 to y=8 in 8 actions? Let's see:\n\nAfter a_72=U, y_73=1\n\na_73=U, y_74=2\n\n...\n\nup to a_79=U, y_80=8? From t=72 to t=79, actions t=72 to t=79, 8 actions? t=72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79: 8 actions, y from 0 to 8? y_72=0, after a_72, y_73=1, ..., after a_79, y_80=8, then a_80=U, y_81=9.\n\nSo from y_72=0 to y_80=8 in 8 actions (t=72 to 79), then one more to y_81=9.\n\nBut we have actions from t=70 and t=71 to get to y_72=0.\n\nIn the stay case: a_70=S, a_71=S, then a_72 to a_80: that's 9 actions to go from y_72=0 to y_81=9? y_72=0, after a_80, y_81=9, so actions t=72 to t=80, 9 actions: each U, y increases by 1 each step from t=73 to t=81.\n\ny_t at turn t:\n\nt=72: y=0\n\na_72=U, y_73=1\n\na_73=U, y_74=2\n\n...\n\na_79=U, y_80=8\n\na_80=U, y_81=9\n\nSo from t=72 to t=80, 9 actions to reach y_81=9 from y_72=0.\n\nBut we have two actions at t=70 and t=71: both S, so total actions t=70 to t=80, 11 actions.\n\nIn the move up-down case: t=70:U, y_71=1\n\nt=71:D, y_72=0\n\nThen t=72:U, ..., t=80:U, same as above, y_81=9, actions t=70 to t=80, 11 actions.\n\nNow, but we have the later danger zone at T=76,77,78 for y=7,8.\n\nIn the above sequence, at T=76: y=4, T=77:y=5, T=78:y=6, all not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nThen T=79:y=7, but T=79>78, safe.\n\nT=80:y=8, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut H=11, can we do better?\n\nPerhaps we can avoid staying or moving down by timing differently.\n\nFor example, since at T=72 we must be at y=0, and we start at y=0, we need to spend two turns to stay or oscillate.\n\nBut we could be at higher y earlier and then come down, but that might take more turns.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=7 or above before T=72, but impossible, as we can only reach y=2 at T=72.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=72.\n\nNow, for the later part, we go directly to y=9, but at T=76,77,78, we are at y=4,5,6, which is fine.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 faster by going through y=7,8 before or after the danger times.\n\nFor example, the danger for y=7,8 is at T=76,77,78.\n\nAt T=76, if we are on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nSimilarly for T=77,78.\n\nSo we need not to be on y=7 or 8 at T=76,77,78.\n\nNow, in the current plan, we are below that.\n\nBut we might be able to be at y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor instance, if we can be at y=7 before T=76 or after T=78.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, we reach y=7 at T=79, which is after T=78, so safe.\n\nBut T=79 is safe for y=7.\n\nNow, can we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we don't delay at the beginning.\n\nBut we have to be at y=0 at T=72, so we lose two turns.\n\nPerhaps we can go down from higher, but we start low.\n\nAnother thought: after T=72, we go up faster, but we can only move one per turn.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to increase y by 9, and we have to spend at least 9 up moves, but due to the constraint, we need extra actions.\n\nIn this case, we have 11 actions: two to stay at start, then nine up moves.\n\nBut the two stay are necessary to avoid T=72 on bad y.\n\nPerhaps we can combine with the later danger.\n\nFor example, at T=76,77,78, we need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the current sequence, we are at y=4,5,6 at those times.\n\nSuppose we want to be at y=7 before T=76.\n\nBut from T=72, y=0, to be at y=7 at say T=75.\n\ny_75=7.\n\nFrom y_72=0 to y_75=7, in three actions? Actions at t=72,73,74 to set y_75.\n\ny_72=0\n\na_72: Δy, y_73\n\na_73: Δy, y_74\n\na_74: Δy, y_75\n\nTo have y_75=7, need sum of three Δy =7, but each |Δy|<=1, so maximum increase 3, to y=3, cannot reach 7.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 after T=78, say at T=79, as we have.\n\nBut to reach y=9 earlier, we need to start earlier, but we are constrained at start.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=6 quickly and then stay or something during danger, but y=6 is safe at T=76,77,78, since only y=7,8 dangerous.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=78, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen after, we go to y=7 at T=79, etc.\n\nBut we can stay at y=6 during the danger if needed, but not necessary.\n\nNow, back to minimizing H.\n\nCurrently H=11.\n\nCan we do with H=10?\n\nFor example, if we can save one action.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need at least 9 up moves.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 9 up moves: from t=72 to t=80, all U, 9 ups.\n\nBut we have two extra actions at t=70 and t=71: both S, or one U and one D, but net zero.\n\nIf we can have only one extra action, but we need to be at y=0 at T=72, and at T=70 we are at y=0, so we must have y_72=0, which requires that from T=70 to T=71, we either stay or go up and down, but both take two actions to keep y=0 at T=72.\n\nUnless we can be at y=0 at T=72 with fewer actions, but from T=70 to T=72, we need to set y_72=0, with y_70=0.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\n- a_70=S, a_71=S: y_71=0, y_72=0\n\n- a_70=U, a_71=D: y_71=1, y_72=0\n\n- a_70=S, a_71=D: but if a_70=S, y_71=0, then a_71=D, but y_71=0, cannot move down, so invalid.\n\n- a_70=U, a_71=S: y_71=1, y_72=1, not 0.\n\nSo only two options: both stay, or up then down.\n\nBoth require two actions to keep y_72=0 with y_70=0.\n\nThus, we must have at least two actions before T=72 to be at y_72=0.\n\nThen from there, at least 9 actions to go to y=9, so minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions t=70 to t=80, 11 actions, y_81=9.\n\nH is the number of turns? The number of actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need the sequence from t=70 to t=70+H-1.\n\nNow, but we have the later danger, but in this sequence it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by going through the danger zone carefully.\n\nFor example, for y=7 and 8, danger at T=76,77,78.\n\nBut we can be on y=7 at T=75 or before, but T=75 is before 76, so safe if we can reach.\n\nBut from T=72 y=0, at T=75, y_75.\n\ny_72=0\n\na_72, a_73, a_74 to set y_75.\n\nWith three actions, max y_75=3 if all U.\n\nAt T=75, y=3, for example.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut at T=76, if y=4, as before.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=79, after danger.\n\nBut T=79 is later than necessary? We can be at y=7 earlier if possible.\n\nBut from T=72, earliest to y=7 is at T=79? y_72=0, a_72=U, y_73=1, ..., a_78=U, y_79=7, so turn T=79, y=7.\n\nIf we go all up, y_79=7.\n\nThen y_80=8, y_81=9.\n\nNow, during T=76,77,78, we are at y=4,5,6, which is safe.\n\nSuppose we want to be at y=8 or 9 during danger times, but y=9 safe, y=8 dangerous at T=76,77,78.\n\nBut to be at y=9 early, we need to start early, but we are delayed.\n\nAnother idea: after being at y=0 at T=72, we go up, but at some point, we can skip the danger by going directly or staying.\n\nBut in this case, since we are below, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for the y=7,8 danger, we can pass through quickly when safe.\n\nBut in this setup, since the danger is multiple turns, we need to avoid those y during those turns.\n\nBut in our path, we are not on y=7,8 during T=76-78, so ok.\n\nNow, can we save a turn?\n\nSuppose we go up immediately to y=1 at T=71, then down to y=0 at T=72, then up.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nAt T=72, y=0, but we could have moved to y=1 at T=73, etc.\n\nBut still.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 at T=75, but impossible.\n\nOr, another thought: the cars on y=7 and 8 are only dangerous at T=76,77,78, but at other times safe, so we can be on y=7 or 8 at other times.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are on y=7 at T=79, which is safe.\n\nBut we can be on y=7 earlier, if we can reach.\n\nEarliest possible to be at y=7: if we start going up immediately, but we have to be at y=0 at T=72.\n\nSuppose we do the up-down at beginning: a_70=U, a_71=D, so at T=72, y=0.\n\nThen from T=72, we go up each turn to y=9.\n\nBut as before.\n\nTo reach y=7 faster: but from T=72 y=0, min turn to y=7 is T=79.\n\ny_79=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 in fewer than 11 actions by not going all the way down.\n\nBut we must be at y=0 at T=72.\n\nUnless there is a freeway that is safe at T=72.\n\nBut y=1 to 6 all dangerous, y=7,8 not reachable.\n\ny=0 is the only safe at T=72.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nSequence 1: stay twice\n\nt=70: S, y_71=0\n\nt=71: S, y_72=0\n\nt=72: U, y_73=1\n\nt=73: U, y_74=2\n\nt=74: U, y_75=3\n\nt=75: U, y_76=4\n\nt=76: U, y_77=5\n\nt=77: U, y_78=6\n\nt=78: U, y_79=7\n\nt=79: U, y_80=8\n\nt=80: U, y_81=9\n\nActions from t=70 to t=80, H=11.\n\nSequence 2: up then down\n\nt=70: U, y_71=1\n\nt=71: D, y_72=0 (since y=1, can move down)\n\nt=72: U, y_73=1\n\nt=73: U, y_74=2\n\n... same as above from t=72 on.\n\nIn this case, at t=71, y=1, which is safe, as T=71 not 72.\n\nThen at t=71, we move down to y_72=0.\n\nThen same actions.\n\nNow, both have 11 actions.\n\nBut in the second sequence, at t=71, we are on y=1, but safe.\n\nNow, for the later part, no issue.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=7,8 at T=76,77,78.\n\nIn the sequence, we are at y=4,5,6, which is fine.\n\nCan we be at y=7 at T=79, but then y=8 at T=80, y=9 at T=81.\n\nBut if we can reach y=9 earlier, say at T=80, but from above, y_80=8, need one more to y=9.\n\nUnless we start earlier, but we have the delay.\n\nSuppose after T=72, we go up faster, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps during the danger period for y=7,8, we can be on y=9, but y=9 is safe, but to be on y=9, we need to reach it.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 by T=76, but from T=72 y=0, to y=9 in 4 turns? Impossible, max to y=4 at T=76? y_72=0, a_72=U, y_73=1, a_73=U, y_74=2, a_74=U, y_75=3, a_75=U, y_76=4.\n\nSo at T=76, y=4, not 9.\n\nCannot reach earlier.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the second sequence, with up and down:\n\nt=70: U\n\nt=71: D\n\nt=72: U\n\nt=73: U\n\nt=74: U\n\nt=75: U\n\nt=76: U\n\nt=77: U\n\nt=78: U\n\nt=79: U\n\nt=80: U\n\nThen y_81=9.\n\nIn this, at t=76: y=4? Let's list positions:\n\nt=70: y=0, action U\n\nt=71: y=1, action D\n\nt=72: y=0, action U\n\nt=73: y=1, action U\n\nt=74: y=2, action U\n\nt=75: y=3, action U\n\nt=76: y=4, action U\n\nt=77: y=5, action U\n\nt=78: y=6, action U\n\nt=79: y=7, action U\n\nt=80: y=8, action U\n\nt=81: y=9\n\nYes.\n\nAt t=76, y=4; t=77, y=5; t=78, y=6; all safe.\n\nt=79, y=7, safe; t=80, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, for the cars, we already checked.\n\nBut at t=79, y=7, we have cars, but at T=79, as computed, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car state for y=7, there are three cars, but only the third one could be dangerous, but at T=79, min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nNow, H=11.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, and we think 11 is min.\n\nBut perhaps we can do with H=10 by not going down but staying at some point.\n\nFor example, if at T=72, we are at y=0, but maybe we can reach y=9 with one less action.\n\nSuppose we have only one action before T=72.\n\nBut at T=70, if we do a_70=S, then y_71=0, then at T=71, if we do a_71=S, y_72=0, or if we do a_71=U, y_72=1, which is dangerous at T=72.\n\nIf we do a_70=U, y_71=1, then a_71 must be D to have y_72=0, but then two actions.\n\nNo way with one action to have y_72=0.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can use either, but perhaps the up-down is better since we make some progress, but in terms of position, same.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut we have to avoid the later danger, but in this case it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence above, when we go from t=78 to t=79, y from 6 to 7 at T=79, which is safe.\n\nBut at T=78, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, but for y=7 and 8, we need to not be there at T=76,77,78.\n\nIn this path, we are not.\n\nBut suppose we want to go to y=7 at T=75, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 or 9 earlier by moving faster, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: the player can stay on a row, but to minimize H, we should not stay unnecessarily.\n\nIn this path, we don't stay except at the beginning or in the up-down.\n\nIn the sequence, we have no extra stays; all actions are U or D except the initial two.\n\nIn the up-down sequence, we have one U and one D at start, then all U.\n\nNet, we have 10 U and one D, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, net +9, with one D, so we have 10 U and one D, but y from 0 to 9, difference 9, with U and D, number of U minus number of D should be 9.\n\nIn this case, 10 U and 1 D, net +9, yes.\n\nIn the stay sequence, 9 U and 2 S, net +9.\n\nBoth H=11.\n\nNow, but in the stay sequence, we have two S, which might be considered waiting, but same H.\n\nFor the answer, we can choose one.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the down move or something.\n\nPerhaps for the y=7,8 danger, since it's multiple turns, we can pass through between, but in this case, since the danger is three consecutive turns, and we need to go from y=6 to y=7 to y=8 to y=9, which takes three turns, so if we are at y=6 at T=78, we can go to y=7 at T=79, etc., but at T=78, if we are on y=7, it would be dangerous, but we are at y=6.\n\nWe could be at y=6 earlier and stay, but that might increase H.\n\nFor example, suppose we reach y=6 at T=77, then stay at T=77 and T=78? But at T=77, y=6, safe, but if we stay, we are still at y=6 at T=78, safe, then at T=78, we can go to y=7 at T=79, but we wasted a turn staying.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly, not beneficial.\n\nSo the sequence we have is fine.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, we have two options for the actions.\n\nBut in the up-down sequence, at t=71, we move down, which might be counterintuitive, but it works.\n\nWe can do both stay.\n\nBut to show action, perhaps the up-down is acceptable.\n\nNow, another thing: in the car state, for y=7 and y=8, there are multiple cars, but we only care if 0 is in span at that turn.\n\nIn our case, for T=76,77,78, on y=7 or 8, it is in span, so collision if on that row.\n\nBut we avoid.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut H=11, actions from t=70 to t=80.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt1=70.\n\nSo for example, with up-down:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: D\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nThen at turn 81, position (0,9).\n\nBut we need to make sure that at all turns, no collision.\n\nTurn 70: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 71: y=1, cars on y=1 at T=71: min= -83+36*(71-70)= -83+36= -47, max= -48+36= -12, both neg, 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 72: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 73: y=1, T=73, min= -83+36*3= -83+108=25>0, max= -48+108=60>0, safe\n\nTurn 74: y=2, cars on y=2 similar to y=1, min=25>0, max=60>0, safe\n\nActually, for y=2, same cars as y=1, so same.\n\nTurn 75: y=3, similar, min=25>0, safe\n\nTurn 76: y=4, cars on y=4: min= -71+24*(76-70)= -71+24*6= -71+144=73>0, max= -48+144=96>0, safe\n\nTurn 77: y=5, similar, min=73>0, safe\n\nTurn 78: y=6, similar, min=73>0? For y=6, same as y=4, min= -71+24*8= -71+192=121>0, T=78, Δt=8, min= -71+192=121>0\n\nTurn 79: y=7, cars on y=7: at T=79, for the critical car, min= -35+4*9= -35+36=1>0, so 0 not in span, safe. Other cars also safe.\n\nTurn 80: y=8, similar, min= -35+4*10= -35+40=5>0, safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nIf we use stay sequence:\n\nTurn 70: S\n\nTurn 71: S\n\nThen Turn 72: U to Turn 80: U, same as above.\n\nBoth work.\n\nPerhaps we can choose the up-down to have some movement.\n\nBut in terms of minimal, same.\n\nNow, but in the task, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format, it seems to output the sequence, not H.\n\nThe boxed should contain the sequence.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm if we can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose we do not go to y=0 at T=72, but since all y=1-6 are dangerous, we must be at y=0.\n\nUnless for some freeway, it is safe at T=72, but from the car states, all y=1-6 have collision at T=72.\n\ny=4,5,6 also only at T=72, as computed.\n\ny=4: only T=72, similarly.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think we can output.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=7 and y=8, it says multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nOne thing: in the freeway 7 and 8, there are three cars each, but only the third one has the span covering 0 at some point, but in our case, we don't care since we avoid the row at that time.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can write the sequence with up-down.\n\nTo make it cleaner, we can use the stay sequence, but up-down is fine.\n\nIn the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: D\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nBut Turn 80: U, then at turn 81, y=9, but the last action is at t=80, and position after is at t=81.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=70 to t=80.\n\nIn the answer format: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt1=70, so t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=11, t from 0 to 10, so a_{70} to a_{80}.\n\nThen the position after all actions is at turn t1 + H = 70 + 11 = 81, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the stay sequence, it would be S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U from t=70 to t=80, but at t=70:S, t=71:S, t=72:U, ..., t=80:U.\n\nBut same number.\n\nI think up-down is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid moving down by noticing that for some rows, the car might not be present, but in this case, all rows have cars.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, at T=76,77,78, 0 is in span, but for other times, it might be safe, but we go later.\n\nI think H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 70\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times, specifically:\n- At turn 72, all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) have a collision at position \\(x = 0\\), so the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at this turn.\n- At turns 76, 77, and 78, freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) have collisions at \\(x = 0\\), so the player must not be on these freeways during these turns.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 70 with \\(y = 0\\). To be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 72, the player moves up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 71 (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is only dangerous at turn 72) and then down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 72. From turn 72 onwards, the player moves up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 81. During turns 76, 77, and 78, the player is at \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) respectively, which are safe as these freeways are only dangerous at turn 72 and not during 76-78.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- Turn 70: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 71. Collision check at turn 70: \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- Turn 71: Move down (D) to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 72. Collision check at turn 71: \\(y = 1\\), cars at \\((-48, -83, \\text{right}, 36)\\); span at \\(T=71\\): \\([-83 + 36(71-70), -48 + 36(71-70)] = [-47, -12]\\), \\(0 \\notin [-47, -12]\\) (safe).\n- Turn 72: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 73. Collision check at turn 72: \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- Turn 73: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 74. Collision check at turn 73: \\(y = 1\\), cars at \\((-48, -83, \\text{right}, 36)\\); span at \\(T=73\\): \\([-83 + 36(73-70), -48 + 36(73-70)] = [25, 60]\\), \\(0 \\notin [25, 60]\\) (safe).\n- Turn 74: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 75. Collision check at turn 74: \\(y = 2\\), similar to \\(y=1\\); span min and max positive, \\(0\\) not in span (safe).\n- Turn 75: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 76. Collision check at turn 75: \\(y = 3\\), similar; safe (min and max positive).\n- Turn 76: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 77. Collision check at turn 76: \\(y = 4\\), cars at \\((-48, -71, \\text{right}, 24)\\); span at \\(T=76\\): \\([-71 + 24(76-70), -48 + 24(76-70)] = [73, 96]\\), \\(0 \\notin [73, 96]\\) (safe).\n- Turn 77: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 78. Collision check at turn 77: \\(y = 5\\), similar to \\(y=4\\); safe.\n- Turn 78: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 79. Collision check at turn 78: \\(y = 6\\), similar to \\(y=4\\); span at \\(T=78\\): \\([-71 + 24(78-70), -48 + 24(78-70)] = [121, 144]\\), \\(0 \\notin [121, 144]\\) (safe).\n- Turn 79: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 80. Collision check at turn 79: \\(y = 7\\), cars include \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 4)\\); span at \\(T=79\\): \\([-35 + 4(79-70), -24 + 4(79-70)] = [1, 12]\\), \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\); other cars have min > 0 (safe).\n- Turn 80: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 81. Collision check at turn 80: \\(y = 8\\), similar to \\(y=7\\); span min and max positive, \\(0\\) not in span (safe).\n\nAfter the last action at turn 80, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 81. This sequence achieves the goal in minimal \\(H = 11\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 72, and I start at y=0. I have to output a sequence of actions: U for up, D for down, or S for stay, that gets me to y=9 safely.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with given positions and speeds. The cars move left or right based on their direction. Since all cars here are moving right, according to the table: for freeways 1 to 6, they have cars moving right, and for 7 and 8, multiple cars all moving right.\n\nLet me list out the cars clearly.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head at 24, tail at -11, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3: same as freeway 1, each has one car with (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: each has one car with (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (56,45, right,4), (20,9, right,4), (-16,-27, right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (56,45, right,4), (20,9, right,4), (-16,-27, right,4)\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe span for a car at time T is given. Since all cars are moving right, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] for right-moving cars, because head and tail both increase.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nt₁ is 72, current turn.\n\nSo let's denote Δt = T - t₁, the number of turns from now.\n\nSo for any car, at time T = t₁ + Δt, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nAnd collision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for some car on that row.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are not on the new row until the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are still on y_T, so you only check for cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9. Since I start at y=0, and y=9 is the goal, and freeways are from 1 to 8, I need to cross all of them.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something. Let me check.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9. Freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars, I assume y=0 and y=9 have no cars, since it says \"freeways y=1,...,8\".\n\nSo at y=0, no cars, so I can stay there safely. Similarly, y=9 should be safe, and once I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so position (0,9), meaning x=0, y=9.\n\nSince the player moves only vertically, I think x is always 0 for the player, and cars are on horizontal freeways, so collision depends on whether x=0 is covered by a car span on the row you're on at that turn.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I start at turn t₁=72, y=0.\n\nI need to move up to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but since I need to go up, and minimize turns, I should mostly go up, but avoid the rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nAlso, since I can stay or move down, but moving down might be necessary to avoid a collision, but since I need to go to 9, moving down might increase the number of turns, so I should avoid that if possible.\n\nBut sometimes it might be faster to wait or move down to avoid a car and then go up later.\n\nBut let's see the car movements.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each car, when x=0 is covered by the car span.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time Δt, if there is a car on row k such that 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for that car.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check all on that row.\n\nAlso, for rows with multiple cars, like 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's handle the easy rows.\n\nFreeway 1: car with h=24, τ=-11, s=36, direction right.\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -11 + 36 Δt , 24 + 36 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 36 Δt\n\nSince s=36, large speed, let's solve inequality.\n\n-11 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 24 + 36 Δt\n\nFirst, -11 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 36 Δt ≤ 11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ 0\n\nΔt ≤ 0 means at or before now, but since we start from Δt=0, which is now.\n\nAt Δt=0: span [ -11 +0, 24+0] = [-11,24], and 0 is between -11 and 24, yes, 0 ∈ [-11,24], so at current time, on row 1, x=0 is occupied.\n\nBut I'm not on row 1 now, I'm on y=0.\n\nNow, for future times.\n\n0 ≤ 24 + 36 Δt always true since Δt ≥0, 24+36Δt ≥24>0.\n\nSo only the lower bound: -11 +36Δt ≤0 ⇒ 36Δt ≤11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/36 <1, so for Δt=0, it holds, for Δt≥1, -11+36Δt ≥ -11+36=25>0, so 0 < -11+36Δt, so 0 not in span because the span is [low, high] with low = τ + s Δt, high = h + s Δt.\n\nAt Δt=0, low=-11, high=24, 0 is in it.\n\nAt Δt=1, low = -11 +36=25, high=24+36=60, [25,60], 0 not in it, since 0<25.\n\nSimilarly for Δt>1, low and high larger, so only at Δt=0, for row 1, x=0 is occupied.\n\nBut at Δt=0, I'm on y=0, not on row 1, so no collision if I were on row 1 now, but I'm not.\n\nFor future, for row 1, x=0 is occupied only at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly for row 2 and row 3, same thing, since same car parameters.\n\nSo for row 1,2,3, x=0 is occupied only at current time Δt=0.\n\nFor Δt≥1, it's safe to be on row 1,2,3.\n\nNow freeway 4: car with h=0, τ=-23, s=24, right-moving.\n\nSpan at Δt: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 24 Δt, 0 + 24 Δt] = [-23 + 24 Δt, 24 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 24 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 Δt\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 24 Δt always true for Δt ≥0, since 24Δt ≥0.\n\n-23 + 24 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 24 Δt ≤ 23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/24 ≈ 0.958, so Δt ≤ 0 since integer.\n\nAt Δt=0: low = -23, high=0, so [ -23, 0], and 0 is included, since it says ≤, so 0 ∈ [-23,0].\n\nAt Δt=1: low = -23 +24 =1, high=24, [1,24], 0 not in [1,24].\n\nSimilarly for Δt>1, higher.\n\nSo for row 4, x=0 occupied only at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly for row 5 and 6, same.\n\nSo rows 1 to 6 are all safe for Δt ≥1, since only occupied at Δt=0.\n\nNow, freeway 7: multiple cars, all right, speed 4.\n\nCars: (56,45, right,4), (20,9, right,4), (-16,-27, right,4)\n\nFor each, span at Δt.\n\nFirst car: h=56, τ=45? Head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail? In the span, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] if head at h, tail at τ, but in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor freeway 7, cars: (56,45, right,4) — so head=56, tail=45? But 56>45, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so tail left.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] if τ is tail, h is head, so [left, right].\n\nThen at T, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly here, for (56,45, right,4), so τ=45, h=56? But in the tuple it's (head, tail), so head=56, tail=45.\n\nBut tail should be left, head right, so if moving right, tail at 45, head at 56? But 45<56, so [τ, h] = [45,56] at t1.\n\nThen at Δt, [45 + 4 Δt, 56 + 4 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (20,9, right,4), so head=20, tail=9, span at t1 [9,20], at Δt [9+4Δt, 20+4Δt]\n\nThird car: (-16,-27, right,4), head=-16, tail=-27, so at t1 [-27,-16], at Δt [-27 +4Δt, -16 +4Δt]\n\nNow for row 7, x=0 is occupied if for some car, 0 in its span.\n\nSo let's find for each car when 0 is in span.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [45+4Δt, 56+4Δt]\n\n45+4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 56+4Δt\n\nBut 45+4Δt ≥45>0 for Δt≥0, so 0 ≤ 56+4Δt true, but 45+4Δt >0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low, high] since low>0.\n\nSimilarly, high=56+4Δt>0, but low>0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSo for first car, never 0 in span, since low starts at 45 and increases.\n\nSimilarly, second car: 0 in [9+4Δt, 20+4Δt]\n\n9+4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 20+4Δt\n\n9+4Δt ≥9>0 for Δt≥0, so low>0, 0 not in interval.\n\nNow third car: 0 in [-27+4Δt, -16+4Δt]\n\n-27+4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -16+4Δt\n\nNow, -27+4Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4Δt ≤ 27 ⇒ Δt ≤ 27/4 = 6.75, so Δt ≤ 6\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -16+4Δt ⇒ 4Δt ≥16 ⇒ Δt ≥4\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 6 inclusive.\n\nLet's check:\n\nAt Δt=4: low = -27+16= -11? 4*4=16, -27+16= -11, high= -16+16=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included, so 0 ∈ [-11,0]\n\nAt Δt=5: low= -27+20= -7, high= -16+20=4, [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=6: low= -27+24= -3, high= -16+24=8, [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=7: low= -27+28=1, high= -16+28=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nAt Δt=3: low= -27+12= -15, high= -16+12= -4, [-15,-4], all negative, 0 not in, since 0 > -4? -4 <0, so 0 > high, not in.\n\nSo for row 7, only the third car can have 0 in span, and that happens at Δt=4,5,6.\n\nSo for row 7, x=0 occupied at Δt=4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so same times, occupied at Δt=4,5,6.\n\nNow, for other rows, we have:\n\nRows 1-6: occupied only at Δt=0, so for Δt≥1, safe.\n\nRow 7 and 8: occupied at Δt=4,5,6.\n\nAlso, row 9 is goal, no cars.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at Δt=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe sequence: at each turn, I choose U, D, or S, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from 0 to 9, the minimal without obstacles is 9 moves up, but I might need to wait or avoid.\n\nHere, the obstacles are at specific times on rows.\n\nI need to be on a row only when it is safe.\n\nAlso, when I move, I am on the starting row during the turn.\n\nLet me denote the state at each time.\n\nLet t be the turn, with t= t₁ + Δt, so Δt=0 at start.\n\nAt Δt=0, turn t=72, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action a_{72}, which determines y_{73} = y_{72} + Δy.\n\nBut during turn 72, I am on y=0, and since no cars on y=0, no collision.\n\nThen at next turn, I move to new y.\n\nI need to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions, I am at y=9.\n\nLet’s say from turn t₁ to t₁ + H -1, with actions from t₁ to t₁ + H -2? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn t₁: I am at position, and I choose action for this turn.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, I have taken H-1 actions from turn t₁ to t₁ + H - 2, and at turn t₁ + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAt time t, action a_{t₁ + t} is taken.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁ + t}, position changes to y_{t₁ + t +1}.\n\nAt turn T = t₁ + t, I am at y_{T}, and I take action a_{T}, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars on row y_T at that time.\n\nFor me to be safe at turn T, when I am on row y_T, it must be that for that row, at time T, x=0 is not occupied by any car.\n\nNow, at the start, turn t₁=72, y=0, safe.\n\nGoal: at some turn T, y_T =9, and I am safe at that turn, since no cars on y=9.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, so at the turn when I arrive at y=9, I should be safe, but since no cars, it's fine.\n\nNow, the path: I need to go through the rows.\n\nThe dangerous times are for row 7 and 8 at Δt=4,5,6.\n\nΔt is from t₁, so at absolute time t = t₁ + Δt.\n\nBut since t₁ is fixed, we can work with Δt.\n\nSet Δt = 0 at start.\n\nSo at Δt=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some Δt.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, the minimal Δt is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to delay if I would be on a bad row at bad time.\n\nNow, rows 1-6 are safe for all Δt except Δt=0, but since at Δt=0 I am on y=0, not on them, so I can be on rows 1-6 at any Δt ≥1 safely.\n\nRows 7 and 8 are unsafe at Δt=4,5,6.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to be on row y at time Δt only if it is safe for that y at that Δt.\n\nWhen I move, I am on the row at the time of the turn.\n\nFor example, if I want to be on row k at time Δt, I need that at that time, row k is safe.\n\nNow, I start at Δt=0, y=0.\n\nI need to end at some Δt, y=9.\n\nThe actions: each action changes y by at most 1, so to go from 0 to 9, I need at least 9 up moves.\n\nEach stay or down move adds extra turns.\n\nTo minimize H, I should minimize the number of extra actions besides the 9 ups.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nIf I go up every turn, it takes 9 turns to reach y=9, so H=9 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn Δt=0: at y=0\n\nAfter action U at Δt=0, at Δt=1, y=1\n\nAfter U at Δt=1, at Δt=2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter U at Δt=8, at Δt=9, y=9\n\nSo at Δt=9, y=9, so I reach at turn Δt=9, with 9 actions.\n\nH-1 = number of actions? The sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1, and at turn t₁ + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn terms of Δt, at Δt = H-1, y=9.\n\nFor example, with 9 up actions: actions at Δt=0 to 8: all U, then at Δt=9, y=9.\n\nSo H actions, Δt from 0 to H-1, at Δt=H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=9, actions at Δt=0 to 8, position at Δt=9 is y=9.\n\nNow, check if this path is safe.\n\nAt each turn, what row am I on?\n\nAt turn Δt=0: y=0, safe, no cars.\n\nAt turn Δt=1: y=1, row 1, at time Δt=1.\n\nFor row 1, as we saw, unsafe only at Δt=0, but at Δt=1, safe. Similarly for all.\n\nAt Δt=1, y=1, row 1, time Δt=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=2, y=2, row 2, time Δt=2, safe.\n\n...\n\nUp to Δt=6, y=6, row 6, time Δt=6, safe, since rows 1-6 safe for Δt≥1.\n\nNow Δt=7: y=7, row 7, time Δt=7.\n\nFor row 7, unsafe at Δt=4,5,6, but at Δt=7, it is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=8: y=8, row 8, time Δt=8, which is after 6, so safe.\n\nThen Δt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nSo actually, with all up moves, starting now, I am never on row 7 or 8 at Δt=4,5,6.\n\nAt Δt=7, I am on row 7, which is safe at Δt=7.\n\nSimilarly row 8 at Δt=8 safe.\n\nSo it seems I can just go straight up without any problem.\n\nIs that right?\n\nΔt from 0 to 9 for the turns when I am on a row.\n\nTurn Δt: at that turn, I am on y, and check collision.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At Δt=0: y=0, safe\n\n- Action U, so at Δt=1, y=1\n\n- At Δt=1: on row 1, time Δt=1, safe\n\n- Action U, to y=2\n\n- At Δt=2: on row 2, time Δt=2, safe\n\n- ...\n- At Δt=6: on row 6, time Δt=6, safe\n\n- Action U, to y=7\n\n- At Δt=7: on row 7, time Δt=7, which is safe for row 7\n\n- Action U, to y=8\n\n- At Δt=8: on row 8, time Δt=8, safe\n\n- Action U, to y=9\n\n- At Δt=9: on row 9, safe, and y=9, done.\n\nSo with 9 actions, from Δt=0 to Δt=8, and at Δt=9, y=9.\n\nH=9 turns? The number of turns: from turn t₁ to t₁ + H-1.\n\nAt turn t₁ + k, for k=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions at t₁ to t₁+H-1, and position at t₁+H is y=9, but we need to be at y=9 at some turn, meaning at the start of that turn or after action?\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so position at turn T should be (0,9).\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T).\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t₁ + H -1, y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t₁ to t₁ + H -2? Let's index properly.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nT = t₁: position y=0\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} set.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, take action a_T.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T.\n\nWe need for some T, y_T =9.\n\nIn terms of Δt, Δt = T - t₁.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=0\n\nAt Δt=1, y=y_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\ny_T at turn T.\n\nFor y_T to be 9 at some T.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt T=t₁ +0: y=0\n\na_{t₁} = U, so y_{t₁+1} =1\n\nAt T=t₁+1: y=1\n\na_{t₁+1}=U, y_{t₁+2}=2\n\n...\nAt T=t₁+8: y=8\n\na_{t₁+8}=U, y_{t₁+9}=9\n\nAt T=t₁+9: y=9\n\nNow, at T=t₁+9, y=9, which is the goal, and we are done.\n\nThe turn when y=9 is T=t₁+9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, actions from t₁ to t₁+8, that's 9 actions, and at turn t₁+9, position is (0,9).\n\nH is the minimal number such that at turn t₁ + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t₁ +9, y=9, so t₁ + H -1 = t₁ +9, so H-1=9, H=10?\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" means that at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd the sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter the actions, position at turn t₁ + H should be (0,9)? Not necessarily.\n\nAt turn t₁ + k, after k actions? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t₁, before any action, position is given.\n\nThen we take action a_{t₁} at turn t₁, which changes to position at turn t₁+1.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn t₁, y_{t₁} =0.\n\nAfter taking a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, we are at y_{t₁+1}, take a_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action at turn t₁ + H -1, we set y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nWe need that at turn t₁ + H, y_{t₁ + H} =9? Or at some turn during.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter taking these H actions, the position is y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nAnd at each turn from t₁ to t₁+H-1, we must not collide, meaning at turn T for T from t₁ to t₁+H-1, when we are at y_T, it must be safe.\n\nIn the goal, when we reach y=9, at that turn, we are on y=9, which is safe, so it's fine.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nActions: at t₁ (Δt=0): U, so y_{t₁+1} =1\n\nAt t₁+1 (Δt=1): U, y_{t₁+2}=2\n\n...\n\nAt t₁+8 (Δt=8): U, y_{t₁+9}=9\n\nNow, at turn t₁+9, y=9, so we need to reach at turn t₁+9.\n\nThe actions are from t₁ to t₁+8, that's 9 actions.\n\nH actions, so H=9.\n\nThen at turn t₁ + H = t₁ +9, y=9.\n\nAnd we need to be safe at turns from t₁ to t₁+H-1 = t₁+8.\n\nIn this case, turns from t₁ to t₁+8: positions y from 0 to 8.\n\nAt turn t₁: y=0, safe\n\nt₁+1: y=1, row 1 at time Δt=1 (since T=t₁+1, Δt=1), safe\n\nt₁+2: y=2, row 2 at Δt=2, safe\n\n...\n\nt₁+6: y=6, row 6 at Δt=6, safe\n\nt₁+7: y=7, row 7 at Δt=7, which is safe as we saw\n\nt₁+8: y=8, row 8 at Δt=8, safe\n\nThen at turn t₁+9, y=9, not part of the action turns, but we are at goal.\n\nIn the collision check, we only care about turns when we are on rows 1-8, since y=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nAt turn t₁+7, y=7, Δt=7, row 7 safe at Δt=7.\n\nSimilarly t₁+8, y=8, Δt=8, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, with 9 actions, all U, I reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H=9 for the actions, meaning 9 turns of actions.\n\nThe sequence: Turn t_1: U, Turn t_1+1: U, ..., up to Turn t_1+8: U.\n\nThen at turn t_1+9, position (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for H=9, t from 0 to 8, actions at t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1+9, we are at (0,9).\n\nNow, is there a way to do it faster? From y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so no, H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it works, so no need for more.\n\nBut earlier I thought about row 7 and 8 at Δt=4,5,6, but in this path, I am on row 7 at Δt=7, which is after, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I were to be on row 7 earlier, it might be bad, but here I am not.\n\nFor example, if I stayed at y=0 for some turns, then went up, I might be on row 7 at bad time, but in this case, I don't need to.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row 7.\n\nAt Δt=7, for row 7, third car: span [-27+4*7, -16+4*7] = [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly at Δt=8, [-27+32, -16+32] = [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nAnd at Δt=4,5,6 it is occupied, but I am not on row 7 at those times.\n\nIn the path, I am on row 7 at Δt=7.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nAlso, for rows 1-6, at Δt=1 to 6, I am on them, all safe.\n\nAt Δt=1, row 1: span at Δt=1 for the car: [ -11 +36*1, 24+36*1] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nBut let me confirm the current state.\n\nCurrent turn t1=72, position (0,0)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 80: U\n\nThen at turn 81, position (0,9)\n\nt1=72, actions from t1 to t1+8, which is 72 to 80.\n\nH=9, t from 0 to 8, t1+t from 72 to 80.\n\nAt turn t1+H = t1+9=81, position y=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 72: a_{72} = U\n\nTurn 73: a_{73} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 80: a_{80} = U\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\n}\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9, but perhaps I can do it with H=8? No, because from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 up moves, so 9 actions, H=9.\n\nIf I start at y=0, after 8 actions, I can be at y=8 at best, not y=9.\n\nAfter k actions, y can be from 0 to k, but since I start at y=0, after first action, y=1 if U, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1+H} is set, which can be up to y_{t1} + H, but y_{t1}=0, so y_{t1+H} <= H, so to have y=9, need H >=9.\n\nEquality when all U.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut the problem has cars, but in this path, no collision, so it should be fine.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on row 4, for example.\n\nAt Δt=0, row 4 occupied, but I am not on it.\n\nAt Δt=1, row 4: car span [-23+24*1, 0+24*1] = [-23+24, 24] = [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the answer format should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 9 actions, all U.\n\nBut let me see if I need to output for each turn.\n\nPerhaps I should include the position or something, but no, just actions.\n\nSo for H=9, actions at t=0 to 8, all U.\n\nSo the sequence is U for each turn from 72 to 80.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format, it seems to imply the sequence, and H is part of it.\n\nIn the box, it should have the turns listed.\n\nPerhaps I should state H.\n\nBut in the format given, it shows the actions per turn.\n\nSo I think writing the sequence as above is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be on a row at bad time.\n\nFor example, when I am at y=6 at Δt=6, which is row 6, safe.\n\nThen I move to y=7 at next turn.\n\nAt turn Δt=6, I am on y=6, action U, so at next turn Δt=7, I am on y=7.\n\nAt turn Δt=7, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose I stayed at y=0 for one turn.\n\nAt turn Δt=0: S, so y=0 still.\n\nThen at Δt=1, y=0, then action U to y=1 at Δt=2? Let's see.\n\nAt Δt=0: action S, so y_{t1+1} =0 (since S)\n\nThen at turn t1+1 (Δt=1): position y=0, then I take action, say U, to y=1 at t1+2.\n\nThen at turn t1+2 (Δt=2): y=1, and so on.\n\nThen I reach y=9 later, at Δt=10, so H=10 or more, worse.\n\nSo no need.\n\nTherefore, minimal is 9.\n\nSo the answer should be all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 72 to 80 inclusive.\n\nt1=72, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to 8, so turns 72 to 80.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{U}\n}\n\nBut since it's minimal, and it works.\n\nBut I recall that for freeway 7 and 8, at Δt=4,5,6, occupied, but in the path, I am not on those rows at those times.\n\nAt Δt=4, I am on which row? If all up, at Δt=0: y=0\n\nΔt=1: y=1\n\nΔt=2: y=2\n\nΔt=3: y=3\n\nΔt=4: y=4, row 4, which is safe.\n\nΔt=5: y=5, row 5, safe\n\nΔt=6: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nΔt=7: y=7, row 7, safe\n\netc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 72\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving up (U) every turn, which is the shortest path since at least 9 up moves are required to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe car states indicate that:\n- Rows 1 to 6 are unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (the current turn), but since the player starts at y=0 and moves to y=1 at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), these rows are safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\).\n- Rows 7 and 8 are unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 4, 5, 6\\) due to the third car on each freeway covering x=0 at those times. However, in the path, the player is on row 7 at \\(\\Delta t = 7\\) and row 8 at \\(\\Delta t = 8\\), which are safe times for these rows (as x=0 is not covered by any car span).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 72 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)), the player is at y=0 and moves up to y=1. Since y=0 has no cars, it is safe.\n- At turn 73 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)), the player is at y=1 (row 1). The car on row 1 at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) has span \\([25, 60]\\), so x=0 is not covered, and it is safe.\n- Similarly, at turns 74 to 79 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\) to \\(\\Delta t = 7\\)), the player moves up through rows 2 to 7, all safe at their respective times.\n- At turn 80 (\\(\\Delta t = 8\\)), the player is at y=8 (row 8). The car on row 8 at \\(\\Delta t = 8\\) has span \\([5, 16]\\) for the relevant car, so x=0 is not covered, and it is safe.\n- After the action at turn 80, the player reaches y=9 at turn 81, which is safe with no cars.\n\nThus, the sequence avoids all collisions and reaches the goal in minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{U}\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So, at turn T, you're on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=74. For future turns, the spans move based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? No, let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: head -48, tail -83, right, 36.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think. Here head is -48, tail is -83, so since -48 > -83, that makes sense, head is to the right.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for freeway 1: at t1=74, span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48]? No.\n\nThe update rule says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [tau, h] meaning from tail to head.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nIn the span notation, it's [tail, head] for right-moving, I think, since it moves right.\n\nLet's clarify the span.\n\nFor right-moving car: at time t1, position from left to right is tail to head, so span is [tail, head].\n\nThen at time T, since it moves right, span becomes [tail + s(T-t1), head + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] or something, but in this case, all cars are right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right\n\nFreeway 2: direction right\n\nFreeway 3: direction right\n\nFreeway 4: head 48, tail 25, right, speed 24. Head 48 > tail 25, so right-moving.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4? No, it says (48,25,right,24) for each, but let's see the table.\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (-48,-83,right,36) | so one car\n\n| 2 | (-48,-83,right,36) | same as 1? Probably different freeway.\n\n| 3 | (-48,-83,right,36) | another one with same car? That seems odd, but possible.\n\n| 4 | (48,25,right,24) |\n\n| 5 | (48,25,right,24) |\n\n| 6 | (48,25,right,24) |\n\n| 7 | (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4) | three cars\n\n| 8 | (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4) | same as 7\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nNow, all cars are right-moving, so no left-moving cars. That simplifies.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, for freeway y_T, if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThe span at T for a right-moving car: initial span at t1 is [tail, head], so at T, span is [tail + s(T-t1), head + s(T-t1)]\n\n0 is in span if tail + s(T-t1) <= 0 <= head + s(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nThe player starts at y=2 at t1=74.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe vertical move: each turn, can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo from y=2 to y=9, minimum moves if we only go up: 7 moves, but we might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nBut since we can only move vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, the collision depends on when we are on which freeway at which turn.\n\nNow, the key point is that we are only on one freeway per turn, and collision is checked for that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that freeways y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars mentioned. The grid is y=0 to 9, and cars on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars to collide with.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), which is y=9, so once there, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start at y=2.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to pass through intermediate y levels.\n\nSince we move one y per turn max, it will take at least 7 turns to go from 2 to 9 if we move up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, which would increase H.\n\nSo H >=7.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions such that for each turn T from t1 onwards, when we are on y_T, the freeway y_T has no car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nThe cars move over time, so we need to compute for each freeway and each car, when 0 is occupied.\n\nLet t = T - t1, so t is the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt time relative to t1, let τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn t1.\n\nThen for a car with speed s, tail, head, at time τ, the position is [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] for right-moving.\n\n0 is in span if tail + s*τ <= 0 <= head + s*τ\n\nWhich means -head <= s*τ <= -tail? Let's solve.\n\ntail + s*τ <= 0 <= head + s*τ\n\nSo from left: tail + s*τ <= 0 ⇒ s*τ <= -tail\n\nFrom right: 0 <= head + s*τ ⇒ s*τ >= -head\n\nSo s*τ >= -head and s*τ <= -tail\n\nSince head > tail for right-moving, -head < -tail, so the interval is s*τ in [-head, -tail]\n\nThen τ must satisfy: ceil( -head / s ) <= τ <= floor( -tail / s )? Let's see.\n\ns*τ >= -head ⇒ τ >= ceil( -head / s ) if s>0\n\nSimilarly, s*τ <= -tail ⇒ τ <= floor( -tail / s )\n\nBut need to handle integer τ.\n\nSince τ integer, τ must satisfy:\n\nτ >= ceil( (-head) / s )\n\nτ <= floor( (-tail) / s )\n\nAnd -head and -tail, since head and tail can be negative.\n\nSimilarly, the number of τ where collision happens.\n\nBut we need for each freeway, the set of τ where there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head = -48, tail = -83, s = 36\n\nThen for this car, s*τ >= -head = -(-48) = 48\n\ns*τ <= -tail = -(-83) = 83\n\nSo 36τ >= 48 and 36τ <= 83\n\nτ >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nτ <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305...) = 2\n\nSo τ=2 only? Let's compute:\n\n48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, ceil to 2\n\n83/36 ≈2.305, floor to 2\n\nSo τ=2: 36*2=72, which is >=48 and <=83? 72 >=48 yes, 72 <=83 yes.\n\nτ=1: 36*1=36, 36 >=48? 36<48, no.\n\nτ=3: 36*3=108, 108 <=83? 108>83, no.\n\nSo only at τ=2, for this car on freeway 1.\n\nBut τ=2 means turn t1 + 2.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same car? head -48, tail -83, s=36, same as freeway 1? But different freeway, so separate.\n\nFreeway 2 has the same parameters: (-48,-83,right,36), so same as freeway 1, so only at τ=2, collision possible if on freeway 2 at that time.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, only τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: head=48, tail=25, s=24\n\ns*τ >= -head = -48\n\ns*τ <= -tail = -25\n\nSo 24τ >= -48? But τ >=0, and s*τ >= -48, since -48 negative, and s*τ >=0 for τ>=0, so s*τ >= -48 always true for τ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, s*τ <= -25\n\n24τ <= -25\n\nBut τ >=0, 24τ >=0, -25<0, so 24τ <= -25 is impossible for τ>=0.\n\ns*τ <= -tail = -25\n\ns*τ is non-negative for τ>=0, -25 is negative, so s*τ <= negative number cannot hold since s*τ >=0.\n\nThus for this car, no τ where 0 is in span, because head=48, tail=25, both positive, and moving right, so span starts at 25 and increases, so 0 is always left of the span, never covered.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same thing.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,25,right,24), head=48, tail=25, both positive, so at τ=0, span [25,48], which is to the right of 0, and as τ increases, it moves further right, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly for 5 and 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nhead=-48, tail=-59\n\nSince right-moving, head > tail? -48 > -59, yes.\n\ns=4\n\ns*τ >= -head = -(-48) = 48\n\ns*τ <= -tail = -(-59) = 59\n\nSo 4τ >= 48 and 4τ <= 59\n\nτ >= ceil(48/4) = ceil(12) =12\n\nτ <= floor(59/4) = floor(14.75) =14\n\nSo τ from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (28,17,right,4)\n\nhead=28, tail=17, both positive.\n\ns*τ >= -head = -28\n\ns*τ <= -tail = -17\n\ns*τ >= -28: since s*τ >=0 > -28, always true for τ>=0\n\ns*τ <= -17: but s*τ >=0, -17<0, impossible, so never collision for this car.\n\nThird car: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nhead=-8, tail=-19\n\nhead > tail: -8 > -19\n\ns=4\n\ns*τ >= -head = -(-8) =8\n\ns*τ <= -tail = -(-19) =19\n\nSo 4τ >=8 and 4τ <=19\n\nτ >= ceil(8/4) = ceil(2) =2\n\nτ <= floor(19/4) = floor(4.75) =4\n\nSo τ from 2 to 4 inclusive.\n\nNow for freeway 7, collision possible from:\n\nFirst car: τ=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: never\n\nThird car: τ=2,3,4\n\nSo overall for freeway 7, collision at τ in {2,3,4,12,13,14}\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7, so same collision times: τ=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 1: collision at τ=2 only\n\nFreeway 2: τ=2\n\nFreeway 3: τ=2\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: no collision at all, since cars not near 0.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 have cars at positive positions moving away, so safe all time.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny must be integer each turn.\n\nActions: U, D, S to change y.\n\nThe collision depends on which y we are at each τ.\n\nFor each turn τ, if we are on freeway k (y=k), then if τ is in the collision set for that freeway, we collide.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, so when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe zones.\n\nAt τ=0, player at y=2.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 with min H.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1 to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence includes actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and after H-1 actions, at turn t1 + (H-1), y should be 9.\n\nTurn indices: at turn T, we perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}? No.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo, at the start of turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T, meaning when we are at y_T for that turn.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, regardless of what action you take. The action affects y_{T+1}, but for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T.\n\nThen, after taking action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo, for each turn T, we are at y_T, and we might collide if on a freeway with car at 0.\n\nThen we choose action to go to next y.\n\nStart at turn t1=74, y=2.\n\nAfter action, at turn 75, y_{75} depends on a_{74}, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T, meaning that at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen the last action is at turn T-1, which sets y_T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn (t1 + H - 1), y =9.\n\nSet τ relative: at τ=0 (turn t1), y=2.\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k, y_k = y at turn t1 + k.\n\nDefine y(τ) for τ=0,1,2,... where y(τ) is the position at turn t1 + τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y(0)=2.\n\nAfter action at turn t1 + τ, we set y(τ+1).\n\nThe collision is at each turn, so at time τ, if y(τ) is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y(τ), at time τ, there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nTime τ is relative to t1.\n\nWe need y(τ) for some τ to be 9.\n\nMinimize the first τ where y(τ)=9.\n\nThen H = τ, since at τ=0, turn t1, after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9? Let's clarify.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t1, position y(0)=2.\n\nWe perform action a_{t1}, which sets y(1) for turn t1+1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+τ, position y(τ), we perform action to set y(τ+1).\n\nWhen y(τ) =9 for some τ, that means at turn t1+τ, we are at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions to reach that: to reach y(τ)=9, we have performed τ actions from τ=0 to τ-1? From τ=0 to τ, we have τ actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+τ-1} set y from 1 to τ.\n\nStart: at τ=0, before any action, y=2.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at τ=1, y(1) is set.\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k, y(k) is set.\n\ny(k) =9 means after k actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1+k.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t1+k, so H in the sequence should be such that at turn t1 + H -1, y=9? Let's see the answer format.\n\nThe task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo the sequence is actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and at turn (t1 + H -1), y=9.\n\nSo at that turn, we have reached y=9.\n\nIn terms of τ, let τ be offset.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t1), y=2.\n\nWe perform actions for τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, but we want at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSet: after m actions, at turn t1 + m, y is set.\n\nWe want for some m, y at turn t1 + m is 9.\n\nThen H-1 = m, so m = H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, where t is index from 0.\n\nDefine: let the turn when we reach y=9 be T_reach.\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + K for some K.\n\nAt T_reach, y=9.\n\nThe last action was at T_reach -1, which set y_{T_reach}.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to turn T_reach -1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T_reach -1, that's (T_reach -1) - t1 +1 = T_reach - t1 actions.\n\nThen H is the number of turns, which is the number of actions, so H = T_reach - t1.\n\nThen in the sequence, actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 + something? Turn t1+H-1 is the last action turn, and after that action, at turn (t1+H-1) +1 = t1+H, y is set, but we want at turn t1+H-1, y=9? Inconsistency.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nRead the task: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, the position is (0,9).\n\nAt that turn, we are at y=9.\n\nThe actions are performed from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt each turn, when we perform the action, we are at current y, then we choose action to go to next y.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, when we are at y_T, if on freeway 1-8, we check collision based on cars at that turn T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T to set y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, for turn T = t1 + H -1, we are at y=9, which is safe, and we don't need to move further.\n\nBut since we are at y=9, no action needed? But the sequence includes the action at that turn? At turn T, we are at y_T, we choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1}, but if we are already at y=9, we might choose S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have action for turn t1 + H -1.\n\nNow, for τ relative to t1.\n\nSet τ such that at turn t1 + τ, for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn t1 + τ, position y(τ).\n\nWe want y(τ) =9 for some τ, and min τ.\n\nThen H = τ + something? Let's see.\n\nIf y(τ) =9 at turn t1+τ, then this is turn T_reach = t1+τ.\n\nThen the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+τ -1 are performed to reach this.\n\nNumber of actions: τ.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, should be such that turn t1 + H -1 = t1+τ, so H-1 = τ, thus H = τ +1.\n\nFor example, if at τ=0, y=9, but here y=2≠9, so not possible.\n\nIf we reach at τ=0, but y(0)=2≠9, so min τ >=0.\n\nSuppose we reach at τ=k, meaning at turn t1+k, y(k)=9.\n\nThen actions were performed at turns t1 to t1+k-1 to set y from 1 to k.\n\nNumber of actions: k.\n\nThen turn t1 + H -1 = t1+k, so H-1 = k, H = k+1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t from 0 to H-1, which is a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, but a_{t1+H-1} is for turn t1+H-1, which sets y at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want at turn t1+H-1, y=9, so that means that a_{t1+H-1} is not needed if we are already there, but we can choose S.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, and we might choose S to stay, but since we are already at goal, it's fine.\n\nThe action at that turn is part of the sequence, but it doesn't change position if we choose S.\n\nFor simplicity, let's define the time when we first reach y=9.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to find min K such that after K actions, y(K) =9.\n\nThen at turn t1+K, y=9.\n\nThen the number of turns H in the sequence: since actions from t1 to t1+K-1, K actions, and at turn t1+K-1 +1 = t1+K, y=9, but the turn where we are at y=9 is t1+K.\n\nThe task says at turn t1 + H -1, y=9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + K, so H-1 = K, thus H = K+1.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn t1 to t1+H-1 = t1 to t1+K, but that includes turn t1+K, which is when we are at y=9, and we choose action for next, but if we choose S, it's ok, but we don't need to move.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's work with τ.\n\nSet τ from 0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe want y(τ) =9 for some τ.\n\nMin τ such that we can achieve y(τ)=9 with no collision at each step.\n\nFor each τ, when at y(τ), if 1<=y(τ)<=8, we must not have collision at that τ for that freeway.\n\nThen we choose action U,D,S to set y(τ+1).\n\ny(τ+1) = y(τ) + Δy, with Δy based on action at turn t1+τ.\n\nNow, collision times for each freeway:\n\nFirst, freeway 1: collision at τ=2 only\n\nFreeway 2: τ=2 only\n\nFreeway 3: τ=2 only\n\nFreeway 4: no collision\n\nFreeway 5: no collision\n\nFreeway 6: no collision\n\nFreeway 7: collision at τ=2,3,4 and τ=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, τ=2,3,4,12,13,14\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way is to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on certain y at certain τ when collision happens.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, freeways 1,2,3,7,8 all have collision if on them.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on y=1 at τ=2, collision (since freeway 1 has car at 0)\n\nSimilarly y=2 at τ=2, freeway 2 collision\n\ny=3 at τ=2, freeway 3 collision\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, collision at τ=2,3,4, so if on y=7 or 8 at τ=2,3,4, collision.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=1,2,3 are dangerous due to their own freeways, and y=7,8 due to freeway 7 and 8.\n\nSimilarly at τ=3 and 4, only freeway 7 and 8 have collision for y=7 and 8.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nAt τ=0, for freeway 2, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 2 has car at τ=2 only, not at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, for freeway 2, the car: head -48, tail -83, s=36.\n\nAt τ=0, span [tail, head] = [-83,-48], 0 not in between, since -48 <0? -48 is less than 0, -83< -48<0, so 0 > head, so 0 not in span, no collision at τ=0 for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, etc.\n\nWe need to plan the path.\n\nSince we need to go up, and the dangerous times are around τ=2,3,4 and later τ=12,13,14.\n\nBut τ=12 is far, since we start from y=2, we can reach y=9 before τ=12 if we go directly.\n\nMin τ to reach y=9 from y=2: if we go up every turn, y increases by 1 each time.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2\n\nAfter action U, at τ=1, y=3\n\nU, at τ=2, y=4\n\nU, at τ=3, y=5\n\nU, at τ=4, y=6\n\nU, at τ=5, y=7\n\nU, at τ=6, y=8\n\nU, at τ=7, y=9\n\nSo at τ=7, y=9.\n\nNow, check for collision during the path.\n\nAt each τ, y(τ):\n\nτ=0: y=2, freeway 2, collision at τ=2 only, not τ=0, so safe.\n\nτ=1: y=3, freeway 3, collision at τ=2 only, not τ=1, safe. (since only τ=2 for freeway 3)\n\nτ=2: y=4, freeway 4. Freeway 4 has no collision at all, so safe.\n\nτ=3: y=5, freeway 5, no collision, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=6, freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=7, freeway 7. Freeway 7 has collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14. τ=5 not in, so safe.\n\nτ=6: y=8, freeway 8, collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14, τ=6 not in, safe.\n\nτ=7: y=9, safe zone.\n\nIn this path, all safe, and we reach at τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=2, we are at y=4, which is freeway 4, no car near 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIs there any issue?\n\nAt τ=2, freeway 7 has collision, but we are not on y=7 at τ=2, we are on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3,4, we are on y=5,6, not 7 or 8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, with 7 up moves, we reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: all U, from τ=0 to τ=6.\n\nActions: at each turn, we choose action to go to next y.\n\nAt turn t1 + τ, for τ=0 to 6, we choose U to increase y.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t1=74, action U, then at τ=1, y=3\n\nAt τ=1, turn 75, action U, to y=4 at τ=2\n\n...\n\nAt τ=6, turn t1+6=80, action U, to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, turn t1+7=81, y=9, but we don't need an action after that for reaching, but the sequence should include actions until the turn before or including?\n\nIn this case, we reach at τ=7, which is turn t1+7.\n\nThen, to have y at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nSet t1 + H -1 = t1 +7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to H-1=7, so actions for turns t1 to t1+7.\n\nBut at turn t1+7, we are at y=9, and we choose an action, say S, but it's not necessary, but we can.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=8, actions for turns 74 to 81.\n\nAt turn 81, if we choose U, y would go to 10, but y max 9, so we must choose S or D, but since we want to stay, choose S.\n\nBut in the path above, at turn 81 (τ=7), we are at y=9, and we can choose S to stay.\n\nSimilarly, at earlier turns.\n\nIn the direct path, we used actions at τ=0 to 6 to go up, and at τ=7 we can stay.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at τ=7, so min τ=7.\n\nWith H=8, we have 8 actions.\n\nSince we reach at τ=7, we can have the last action at turn t1+6 (τ=6) to set y=9 at τ=7.\n\nThen turn t1+6 is when we perform action to set y=9 at next turn.\n\nThen at turn t1+6, we are at y=8, choose U, to go to y=9 at turn t1+7.\n\nBut the position at turn t1+6 is y=8, not 9.\n\nWe want at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo for H such that t1+H-1 = t1+7, so H-1=7, H=8, and at turn t1+7, y=9.\n\nThen actions from turn t1 to t1+7.\n\nAt turn t1+7, we are at y=9, and we choose action, say S, to stay at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1 to t1+6, we choose U to go up.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1 to t1+6: U, and turn t1+7: S.\n\nBut turn t1+7 is when we are at y=9, and we choose S.\n\nNow, in terms of collision: at turn t1+7, we are on y=9, no car, safe.\n\nIn the path above, when we go directly up, at each turn, we were safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn t1 (τ=0): y=2, freeway 2, no collision (only at τ=2)\n\nAction U\n\nTurn t1+1 (τ=1): y=3, freeway 3, no collision (τ=2 only)\n\nAction U\n\nTurn t1+2 (τ=2): y=4, freeway 4, no collision ever, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn t1+3 (τ=3): y=5, freeway 5, no collision, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn t1+4 (τ=4): y=6, freeway 6, no collision, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn t1+5 (τ=5): y=7, freeway 7, collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14; τ=5 not in, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn t1+6 (τ=6): y=8, freeway 8, collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14; τ=6 not in, safe\n\nAction U? At turn t1+6, we are at y=8, choose U to go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nThen turn t1+7 (τ=7): y=9, safe, and we choose S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify action for turn t1+7 as well.\n\nSince we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, H=8, with actions: for turns 74 to 81.\n\nBut turn 81 is t1+7.\n\nt1=74, t1+7=81.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U  (to go from y=8 to y=9 at turn 81)\n\nAt turn 80: τ=6, y=8, choose U, so at turn 81, y=9.\n\nThen at turn 81, we are at y=9, choose S to stay.\n\nBut the sequence should end with the action that sets y=9? No, the sequence includes actions until we reach.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions to reach, and at the turn when we reach, we can have an action.\n\nBut in this case, with 7 up actions and one stay, but we used 7 U to go from 2 to 9, in 7 steps: from y=2 to y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9, that's 7 increments, so 7 actions to reach y=9 at turn t1+7.\n\nThen at turn t1+7, we are at y=9, and we need an action for that turn in the sequence if H=8.\n\nSince the goal is to reach (0,9), and at that turn, we can choose any action, but to stay, choose S.\n\nBut in terms of min H, with H=8, we have 8 actions, but we reached at the 7th action? Let's count.\n\nActions at turn: action at turn T sets y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn t1=74, action a74 sets y75.\n\nSimilarly, a75 sets y76, ..., a_{t1+k} sets y_{t1+k+1}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nThen actions from turn t1 to turn T-1 set y from t1+1 to T.\n\nFor example, to have y_T=9, actions from t1 to T-1 determine y_{t1+1} to y_T.\n\nWith y_{t1} =2.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn t1 to T-1, that is (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1 actions.\n\nThen H such that T = t1 + H -1, so T - t1 = H-1.\n\nThus number of actions is H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, H actions? The sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, meaning turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nThen the actions at turn t1 to t1+H-2 set the positions, and at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, and we choose an action, but it doesn't affect the position since we are already there.\n\nIn the direct path, we can reach at turn t1+7 with y=9.\n\nSo T = t1+7, y_T=9.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1, so t1+7 = t1 + H -1, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions for turns t1 to t1+7, that is 8 actions.\n\nBut with 7 up moves, we reach y=9 at turn t1+7.\n\nAt turn t1+7, we are at y=9, so for the action at turn t1+7, we can choose S.\n\nSimilarly, at turns t1 to t1+6, we choose U.\n\nNow back to the collision: in this path, as I checked earlier, no collision at any point.\n\nBut is there a problem at τ=2?\n\nAt turn t1+2 (τ=2), we are at y=4, freeway 4, which has no collision, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have collision at τ=2,3,4, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nAt τ=5, we are on y=7, but τ=5 not collision time for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=2, and we go directly to y=9 in 7 moves, reaching at τ=7.\n\nH=8 with the stay at the end.\n\nBut we can have H=7 if we reach earlier? From y=2 to y=9, min 7 moves, so τ=7 is minimum possible, so H=8 is min.\n\nWith H=7, then t1+H-1 = t1+6, so at turn t1+6, y should be 9.\n\nBut at turn t1, y=2, to be at y=9 at turn t1+6, we need to increase by 7 in 6 turns, which requires moving up every turn with no stay, but each up move increases by 1, so from turn t1 to t1+6, positions: at t1:2, after a_{t1}: y_{t1+1}, ..., after a_{t1+5}: y_{t1+6}, we want y_{t1+6}=9.\n\ny_{t1}=2\n\nAfter 6 actions, y_{t1+6} = 2 + number of U minus number of D, with S not changing.\n\nTo have y_{t1+6} =9, need net +7 in 6 actions, which is impossible since max increase is 6 with all U.\n\ny_{t1+6} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t1 to t1+5.\n\nΔy each between -1,0,1.\n\nSum of 6 Δy, min -6, max +6.\n\ny_{t1+6} = 2 + sum_{k=0}^{5} Δy_{t1+k}\n\nWe want this =9, so 2 + sum =9, sum=7.\n\nBut max sum is 6 if all U, so impossible to reach y=9 by turn t1+6.\n\nSimilarly, earliest possible is turn t1+7 with all U, y_{t1+7} =2 +7*1 =9.\n\nSo min τ=7 to reach y=9.\n\nThus H=8 is minimum.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have 7 U and one S at the end, but with 7 U actions from turn t1 to t1+6, we reach y=9 at turn t1+7.\n\nThen at turn t1+7, we choose S.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=8, actions for turn t1 to t1+7.\n\nAt turn t1+7, we choose S.\n\nIn the path, we don't need to go down or stay, since no collision.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision times again.\n\nAt τ=2, freeway 1,2,3,7,8 have collision.\n\nBut in our path, at τ=2, we are on y=4, which is freeway 4, no issue.\n\nAt τ=3, freeway 7 and 8 have collision, but we are on y=5.\n\nSimilarly τ=4, on y=6.\n\nNo problem.\n\nMoreover, for freeway 7 and 8, collision at τ=12,13,14, but we are at y=9 before that, so fine.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nThe car on freeway 7 and 8 at τ=2,3,4, but we are not there.\n\nSo this path should work.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nt1=74.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 74: U (to go to y=3 at next turn? At turn 74, we are at y=2, choose U, so y_{75} = y_{74} +1 =3)\n\nSimilarly, turn 75: at y=3, choose U, y_{76}=4\n\nTurn 76: at y=4, choose U, y_{77}=5\n\nTurn 77: at y=5, choose U, y_{78}=6\n\nTurn 78: at y=6, choose U, y_{79}=7\n\nTurn 79: at y=7, choose U, y_{80}=8\n\nTurn 80: at y=8, choose U, y_{81}=9\n\nNow at turn 81, we are at y=9, and for the sequence, since H=8, we need action for turn 81 as well.\n\nAt turn 81, we are at y=9, choose S, so y_{82}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be included.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should list actions until we reach.\n\nNow, but in this, at turn 80, we choose U to go to y=9 at turn 81.\n\nThen at turn 81, choose S.\n\nBut for turn 81, action S.\n\nIn the collision, at turn 81, y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there a way with smaller H? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by moving down or something, but no, we need to go up, so min 7 steps up.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=2.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t1+H-1 = turn 81, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, but let's confirm if at any point we might be on a freeway during collision.\n\nFor example, at turn 76: which is t1+2, τ=2, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: no collision.\n\nTurn 77: τ=3, y=5, freeway 5, no collision.\n\nTurn 78: τ=4, y=6, freeway 6, no collision.\n\nTurn 79: τ=5, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14. τ=5 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 80: τ=6, y=8, freeway 8, collision at τ=2,3,4,12,13,14, τ=6 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 81: τ=7, y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem is for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we already considered the collision times.\n\nIn freeway 7, at τ=5, no car has 0 in span, as computed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are three cars each, but we only care if any has 0 in span at that τ.\n\nFor freeway 7 at τ=5: first car spans τ=12 to14, second car never, third car τ=2 to4, so at τ=5, no car has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8, with all U actions except the last one could be S, but in the sequence, we can have U for turns 74 to 80, and S for turn 81.\n\nBut at turn 80, we choose U to go to y=9, then at turn 81, we choose S.\n\nSince at turn 81 we are at y=9, we can choose S immediately, but in the sequence, it's included.\n\nTo have only necessary actions, but H=8 requires 8 actions.\n\nWe can have the sequence with 7 U actions, but then for H, if we set H=7, then at turn t1+6=80, y should be 9.\n\nBut at turn t1=74, y=2, after 6 actions, y_{80} = y_{t1+6}.\n\ny_{t1+6} = y_{74} + sum of Δy from actions at turn 74 to 79? Actions at turn T affect y_{T+1}.\n\ny_{t1} =2\n\nAfter action at turn t1: y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn t1+5: y_{t1+6}\n\nTo have y_{t1+6} =9, need from y_{t1}=2 to y_{t1+6}=9, increase by 7 in 6 steps, impossible.\n\nThus cannot reach by turn t1+6.\n\nMust be at least turn t1+7.\n\nThus H=8 is minimum.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nBut at turn 80, we choose U to go to y=9 at turn 81.\n\nAt turn 81, we choose S to stay.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nSince at turn 81 we are at y=9, and we choose S, it's fine.\n\nNow, but in the box, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nAlso, for the cars, is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, at τ=2,3,4, collision, but we are not there.\n\nBut at τ=5, we are on y=7, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the position for freeway 7 at τ=5.\n\nFor example, the third car: head -8, tail -19, s=4.\n\nAt τ=5, position: tail + s*τ = -19 + 4*5 = -19 +20 =1\n\nHead + s*τ = -8 +20=12\n\nSpan [1,12], so 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, first car at τ=5: tail -59, s=4, τ=5, -59 +20= -39, head -48+20=-28, span [-39,-28], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car not near.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all up moves until reach y=9, then stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have 7 U and one S.\n\nIn the actions above, turns 74 to 80: U, turn 81: S.\n\nBut turn 80: U to go from y=8 to y=9 at turn 81.\n\nThen turn 81: S to stay.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, we can stop, but the sequence includes it.\n\nPerhaps we can have S at turn 80 if we are already at y=9, but we are not, we are at y=8 at turn 80.\n\nAt turn 80, y=8, we need to choose U to go to 9.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence is fixed.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=8, and we have 8 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 81 is included.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nSince the player might choose to stay at some point, but not necessary.\n\nAnother path: suppose at τ=2, if we were on y=1,2,3, it would be bad, but we are not.\n\nWe could delay or something, but no need, since we can go directly.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=2 for some turn, but then it takes more turns, worse.\n\nSimilarly, moving down not helpful.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut let's check if at τ=0,1, etc., but all fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2 at τ=0: y=2, freeway 2, car at [-83,-48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 74. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to y = 8.\n\nThe minimum number of turns required to reach y = 9 from y = 2 is 7 upward moves, as each \"U\" action increases y by 1. Reaching y = 9 at turn 81 (relative turn τ = 7) requires H = 8 turns, with the sequence of actions ending at turn 81 to satisfy y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{81} = 9.\n\nThe collision analysis for each freeway shows that the direct upward path is safe:\n- Freeways 1, 2, and 3 have collisions only at τ = 2 (turn 76), but at that turn, the player is at y = 4 (freeway 4), which has no collisions at any time.\n- Freeways 4, 5, and 6 have no collisions at any time, so positions y = 4, 5, 6 are always safe.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 have collisions at τ = 2, 3, 4 (turns 76, 77, 78) and τ = 12, 13, 14 (beyond the path timeframe). At τ = 5 (turn 79), the player is at y = 7 (freeway 7), which is safe (no collision at τ = 5). Similarly, at τ = 6 (turn 80), y = 8 (freeway 8) is safe (no collision at τ = 6).\n- y = 9 is a safe zone with no cars.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions is:\n- Turns 74 to 80: \"U\" to move upward each turn, reaching y = 9 at turn 81.\n- Turn 81: \"S\" to stay at y = 9, as the position is already the goal.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in H = 8 turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player starts at turn t_1 = 78 at position y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with positions and speeds. The positions are given at turn t_1=78, and for future turns, they move based on their direction and speed.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on for collision.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, we probably need to go up most of the time, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at turn 78.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so positions increase.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: span becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: span becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, head and tail: at t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, since head is the front.\n\nIn the notation, for freeway 1: head -48, tail -83. Since it's right-moving, and tail -83, head -48, so τ = -83, h = -48, so at t_1, span is [-83, -48]? But it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so if head is -48 and tail is -83, since -83 < -48, so span is [-83, -48], meaning from -83 to -48.\n\nThen at time T, for right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-83 + 36(T-78), -48 + 36(T-78)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn t if after action at turn t, y_t is set, and that's the row for turn t.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_t is the position, and we check if for that y_t, 0 is in the car span for that freeway at turn t.\n\nNow, for freeway 1, we need to find when 0 is in the span.\n\nSet the span equal to include 0.\n\nFor freeway 1: right-moving, s=36, τ=-83, h=-48\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 + 36(T-78) , -48 + 36(T-78) ]\n\n0 is in this interval if:\n\n-83 + 36(T-78) <= 0 <= -48 + 36(T-78)\n\nSet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 78\n\nSo:\n\n-83 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2 since integer\n\nΔt is integer, turns.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 48 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt >= 2\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = 2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, ceil to 2.\n\nAnd Δt <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2? 83/36=2.305, floor is 2.\n\nFrom first: -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 = 2.305, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 2\n\nFrom second: 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 36 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >= 2\n\nThus Δt=2\n\nSo at Δt=2, T=78+2=80, 0 is in the span.\n\nCheck: at T=80, Δt=2, span: left = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n\nRight = -48 + 72 = 24\n\nSo span [-11,24], and 0 is between -11 and 24, yes.\n\nAt other times? For example, Δt=1: left = -83 + 36*1 = -47, right = -48 + 36? -48 + 36 = -12? Earlier: h + s Δt = -48 + 36*1 = -12\n\nτ + s Δt = -83 + 36 = -47\n\nSpan [-47, -12], which is negative, 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: left = -83 + 108 = 25? 36*3=108, -83+108=25, right = -48+108=60, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=80, collision on freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 has only one car, so only at T=80.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Head -48, tail -83, right, speed 36, same as freeway 1.\n\n| Freeway 1 | (-48, -83, right, 36) |\n\nFreeway 2 | (-48, -83, right, 36) | same as 1.\n\nFreeway 3 | (-48, -83, right, 36) | also same.\n\nFreeway 4 | (-48, -71, right, 24) | head -48, tail -71, right, speed 24.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 and 6 same as 4.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFirst, let's do freeway 4, since 5 and 6 same.\n\nFreeway 4: head -48, tail -71, right, s=24\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-71 + 24 Δt, -48 + 24 Δt]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-71 + 24 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt\n\nFirst: -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 => 24 Δt <= 71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt => 24 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 2\n\n48/24=2 exactly.\n\nSo Δt >= 2 and Δt <= 2, so only Δt=2, T=80\n\nAt Δt=2, left = -71 + 48 = -23, right = -48 + 48 = 0? -48 + 24*2 = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-23, 0], so 0 is included, since it says \"0 in span\", and it's the endpoint, probably included.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=1: left = -71 + 24 = -47, right = -48 + 24 = -24, span [-47,-24], not include 0.\n\nΔt=3: left = -71 + 72 =1, right = -48 +72=24, span [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 4 also collision only at T=80.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same.\n\nNow freeway 7: has three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll with speed 4, right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37? Span at t_1: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [37,48] I think, but it says head h, tail τ, so if head is 48, tail 37, then since right, span [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, second car: head 12, tail 1, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: head -24, tail -35, span [-35,-24]\n\nNow at time T, for each, span moves right with speed 4.\n\nSo car1: [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt]\n\nCar2: [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\nCar3: [-35 + 4 Δt, -24 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span for freeway 7 if for any of these, 0 is in the interval.\n\nFirst, car1: [37+4Δt, 48+4Δt], since 37+4Δt >0 for Δt>=0, and increasing, min at Δt=0 is 37, so always positive, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [1+4Δt, 12+4Δt], min 1>0, always positive, 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [-35 + 4 Δt, -24 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in if -35 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 4 Δt <= 0 => 4 Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/4 = 8.75, so Δt <= 8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 4 Δt => 4 Δt >= 24 => Δt >= 6\n\nSo for Δt from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nT = 78 + Δt, so T=84,85,86? Δt=6,7,8\n\nΔt=6: left = -35 + 24 = -11, right = -24 + 24 = 0, span [-11,0], 0 included\n\nΔt=7: left = -35 + 28 = -7, right = -24 + 28 = 4, span [-7,4], includes 0\n\nΔt=8: left = -35 + 32 = -3, right = -24 + 32 = 8, span [-3,8], includes 0\n\nΔt=5: left = -35+20= -15, right=-24+20=-4, span [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nΔt=9: left=-35+36=1, right=-24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, collision when T=84,85,86.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7? | 8 | (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4) | same as 7.\n\nSo freeway 8 also collision at T=84,85,86.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3 have collision only at T=80.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 at T=80.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 at T=84,85,86.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on those freeways at those times.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 78.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we start at 0, need to go to 9, each move can change by at most 1, so minimum H=9 turns if we go up every time, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=78 to t=78+H-1, position at turn t+ something.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nTurn t_1 = 78, position y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we move to y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy, but y_{t+1} is set after action at t.\n\nAt turn t, we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThe position after action at turn t is y_{t+1}, I think.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nThen collision at turn T if player is on freeway y_T and 0 in car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T is where you are during that turn.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nFrom player update, at turn t, we have y_t, then we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, position is y_t, then we choose action for this turn, which determines where we are for the next turn? I'm confused.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nTypically, in such games, at the start of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which causes a move, so at the end of turn t, position changes to y_{t+1}, but the collision is checked during turn t or after?\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is based on that.\n\nFor example, at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you check if for that row, 0 is in the car span at time T.\n\nThen, after action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo position y_t is defined for each turn t.\n\nAt turn t=78, y_78 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_78, y_79 = y_78 + Δy_78, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and 0 in span for that freeway at time t.\n\nNow, we start at turn 78, y_78=0.\n\nFreeway y=0 is not listed, so no cars on y=0, so no collision at y=0, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nSo at turn 78, y=0, no collision possible.\n\nWe need to reach y_? =9.\n\nAt some future turn, say t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=78, so at turn 78 + H -1, position should be 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=78 to t=78+H-2 or something.\n\nLet's set t_start = 78.\n\nPosition at turn t: y_t for t = t_start, t_start+1, ..., up to when y_t =9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so after H actions, from t_start to t_start + H -1, position at turn t_start + H -1 should be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, at turn 78, y_78=0, not 9.\n\nAfter one action, at turn 79, y_79 could be 0,1, or -1 but y min 0, so 0 or 1.\n\nNot 9.\n\nMinimal H to reach y=9: since each move changes y by at most 1, from 0 to 9, need at least 9 moves up, so minimal H=9, if we go up every turn.\n\nAt turn t=78 + k, position y_{78+k}\n\nAfter k turns, position at turn 78+k.\n\nTo have y_{78+k} =9, we need to have increased by 9, so k>=9, since each action can increase by at most 1.\n\nIf we go up every time, at turn 78, y=0; after first action, turn 79, y=1; ... after 9th action, turn 87, y=9.\n\nTurn indices: turn 78: y=0\n\nAfter a_78: y_79 = y_78 + Δy_78\n\nIf a_78=U, y_79=1\n\nThen at turn 79, y=1\n\nAfter a_79, y_80= y_79 + Δy_79, and so on.\n\nSo to have y_t=9 at some t.\n\nAt turn 78: y=0\n\nTurn 79: y=1 if U, or 0 if S, or 0 if D but y min 0, so if D at y=0, y stays 0.\n\ny_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy_t))\n\nBut since y_t between 0 and 9, and Δy_t in {-1,0,1}, so y_{t+1} stays in [0,9].\n\nNow, for y_t to be 9, we need to reach it.\n\nMinimal: if always U, then:\n\nTurn 78: y=0\n\na_78=U: y_79=1\n\nTurn 79: y=1\n\na_79=U: y_80=2\n\n...\nUp to a_86=U: y_87=9\n\nAt turn 87, y=9.\n\nWith actions from t=78 to t=86, that's 9 actions: t=78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86 for actions, then y_87=9.\n\nH=9 turns: turns from t=78 to t=78+H-1=86, so actions at t=78 to 86, position at t=87=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=78 to t=78+H-1.\n\nBut we need to check if this path has collisions.\n\nIn this path, we go through each row from 1 to 8 at certain times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn 79: y=1\n\nTurn 80: y=2\n\nTurn 81: y=3\n\nTurn 82: y=4\n\nTurn 83: y=5\n\nTurn 84: y=6\n\nTurn 85: y=7\n\nTurn 86: y=8\n\nTurn 87: y=9\n\nNow, collision only on freeways 1-8, so at y=1 to 8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway when it has collision at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway, we have collision times.\n\nFreeway 1: collision at T=80\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 4: collision at T=80\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7: collision at T=84,85,86\n\nFreeway 8: same, T=84,85,86\n\nNow, in the direct path:\n\nAt turn 80, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has collision at T=80? Freeway 2 has cars, and at T=80, collision, as we calculated.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 at T=80, but we are on freeway 2 at turn 80.\n\nAt each turn, we are on one freeway.\n\nAt turn 80, y=2, so freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has the same cars as freeway 1, so collision at T=80.\n\nTherefore, if we are on y=2 at turn 80, collision occurs.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 84, y=6, freeway 6? Freeway 6 is y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=80 collision, but T=84 is later.\n\nFreeway 6: we have freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nIn the car state, freeway k for y=k.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, collision at T=80\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, collision at T=80\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, collision at T=80\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, collision at T=80\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, collision at T=80\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, collision at T=80? Freeway 6 has (-48,-71,right,24), same as 4,5, so yes, collision at T=80 only.\n\nBut T=80 is turn 80.\n\nAt turn 84, freeway 6 should be safe, since only collision at T=80.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: y=7, collision at T=84,85,86\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, collision at T=84,85,86\n\nNow in direct path:\n\nTurn 79: y=1, freeway 1. But freeway 1 collision only at T=80, not at T=79. At T=79, for freeway 1: span as before, at Δt=1, T=79, span [-47,-12], not include 0, so no collision at T=79 on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, turn 80: y=2, freeway 2, collision at T=80, yes.\n\nSo problem at turn 80.\n\nAlso, later: turn 84: y=6, freeway 6. Freeway 6 collision only at T=80, not at T=84, so safe.\n\nTurn 84: y=6, freeway 6, no collision at T=84.\n\nTurn 85: y=7, freeway 7, and freeway 7 collision at T=85, yes.\n\nTurn 86: y=8, freeway 8, collision at T=86, yes.\n\nSo in direct path:\n\n- Turn 80: on y=2, collision\n\n- Turn 85: on y=7, collision\n\n- Turn 86: on y=8, collision\n\nMultiple collisions.\n\nWe need to avoid these.\n\nSpecifically, we need to not be on freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6 at turn 80, and not on freeway 7 or 8 at turns 84,85,86.\n\nSince freeways 1-6 all have collision only at T=80, we just need to not be on any of them at T=80.\n\nSimilarly, for 7 and 8, not on them at T=84,85,86.\n\nNow, we start at turn 78, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to wait or move down to avoid being on certain rows at critical times.\n\nSince T=80 is early, and we are at low rows, we might stay on y=0 or go down, but y=0 is min, we can stay.\n\nSimilarly, for later times, we might need to be on higher rows earlier or later.\n\nFirst, let's list the critical times:\n\n- At turn 80, we must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6 (freeways 1-6)\n\nFreeways 1 to 6 cover y=1 to 6.\n\ny=1 to 6 must be avoided at T=80.\n\ny=7 and 8 are freeway 7 and 8, which at T=80, do they have collision? Freeway 7 at T=80: let's see.\n\nFreeway 7: cars, at T=80, Δt = T - t_1 = 80-78=2\n\nCar1: [37 + 4*2, 48 + 4*2] = [37+8,48+8]= [45,56]\n\nCar2: [1+8,12+8]=[9,20]\n\nCar3: [-35+8, -24+8]=[-27,-16]\n\nNone include 0, so no collision on y=7 at T=80.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nAlso y=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nSo at T=80, only y=1 to 6 have collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=84,85,86, y=7 and 8 have collision.\n\nT=84,85,86.\n\nNow, we need to plan the path.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t=78.\n\nWe can stay at y=0 for some turns, or move up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical point is t=80; we must not be on y=1-6 at t=80.\n\nPossible positions at t=80: y=0, or y=7,8,9 but y=9 is far, or y<0 not possible.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=7 or 8 at t=80: as above, no collision, since only cars on 7 and 8 are problematic later.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut from t=78 to t=80, only two actions: from t=78 to t=79 and t=79 to t=80.\n\nAt t=78, y=0.\n\nAfter a_78, y_79 = 0 or 1.\n\nThen at t=79, after a_79, y_80 = y_79 + Δy_79.\n\nTo not be on y=1-6 at t=80, y_80 must be 0 or 7 or 8 or 9.\n\nBut y=7,8,9 impossible in two moves from y=0, since max y_79=1, then y_80 max 2 if up twice.\n\ny_79 <=1, y_80 <=2.\n\nSo y_80 can be at most 2.\n\nThus only possible safe at t=80 is y_80=0.\n\ny_80 must be 0 to avoid collision.\n\nBecause y_80=1 or 2 would be on freeway 1 or 2, collision.\n\ny_80=0 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y_80 cannot be 7,8,9.\n\nSo must have y_80=0.\n\nTherefore, at turn 80, position must be 0.\n\nNow, from start: t=78, y=0.\n\nTo have y_80=0.\n\ny_80 is set after actions at t=78 and t=79.\n\ny_80 = y_79 + Δy_79\n\ny_79 = y_78 + Δy_78 = 0 + Δy_78\n\nSo y_79 = Δy_78, since y_78=0, Δy_78 in { -1,0,1}, but y_79 >=0, so if Δy_78 = -1, y_79=0, else if 0, y_79=0, if +1, y_79=1.\n\nThen y_80 = y_79 + Δy_79\n\nWe need y_80=0.\n\nCases:\n\n- If y_79=0, then y_80 = 0 + Δy_79, so to have y_80=0, need Δy_79=0, so a_79=S\n\n- If y_79=1, then y_80 = 1 + Δy_79, to have y_80=0, need Δy_79 = -1, so a_79=D\n\nBut if y_79=1, and we go down, y_80=0.\n\nNow, we also need to consider if there is collision at t=79.\n\nAt t=79, y_79 position.\n\nIf y_79=0, safe.\n\nIf y_79=1, freeway 1, is there collision at t=79?\n\nFreeway 1 at t=79: Δt=1, span [-47,-12], no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not relevant.\n\nSo both options possible.\n\nBut to have y_80=0:\n\nOption 1: stay at y=0 for both turns.\n\na_78 = S, then y_79=0\n\na_79 = S, then y_80=0\n\nOption 2: go up then down.\n\na_78 = U, y_79=1\n\na_79 = D, y_80=0\n\nBoth achieve y_80=0 with no collision at t=79.\n\nNow, since we want minimal turns, going up and down might waste moves, but we have to, to avoid.\n\nBut in terms of time, both take two turns to be at y=0 at t=80, same as starting.\n\nNow, after t=80, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut there are later collisions at t=84,85,86 on y=7 and 8.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 at t=84,85,86, and not on y=8 at t=84,85,86.\n\nt=84,85,86 are three consecutive turns.\n\nNow, from t=80, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are t=84,85,86.\n\nWe must not be on y=7 or 8 during those turns.\n\nPossible to be on lower rows, or on y=9, or on y=7 or 8 before or after.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, let's see the time.\n\nFrom t=80 to t=84, there are 4 turns: t=80,81,82,83 actions, positions at t=81,82,83,84.\n\nt=80: y=0\n\nAfter actions at t=80,81,82,83, we have positions up to t=84.\n\nSimilarly, t=84 position depends on actions up to t=83.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=84,85,86.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are adjacent, and times are consecutive, it might be tricky to avoid them for three turns.\n\nWe can be on y=6 or y=9, etc.\n\nFirst, let's list possible paths.\n\nMinimal time: we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nFrom t=80, y=0, need to go to y=9, min 9 turns, but we might need to detour.\n\nSince we have to avoid t=84,85,86 on y=7/8, we can either pass through y=7/8 before t=84 or after t=86.\n\nt=84 is soon.\n\nCurrent turn t=80.\n\nt=84 is 4 turns later: t=80,81,82,83, then t=84.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=80, to be on y=7 at t=84, we need to increase by 7 in 4 turns, which requires moving up every time: y_81=1, y_82=2, y_83=3, y_84=4? If start from t=80 y=0.\n\nAfter a_80: y_81\n\nIf all U: y_81=1, y_82=2, y_83=3, y_84=4, y_85=5, etc.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=84: y_84=7.\n\ny_84 = y_80 + sum of Δy from t=80 to t=83, 4 actions.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y_84 = 0 + 4*1 =4.\n\ny_84 <=4 from y=0 in 4 actions.\n\nCannot reach y=7 at t=84 from y=0 at t=80.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 or 9 impossible.\n\nMax we can be at t=84 is y=4.\n\nBut y=4 at t=84 is freeway 4, which has no collision except at t=80, which is past, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3,4 all safe at t=84.\n\nNow, we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at t=84,85,86.\n\nSince at t=84, we are at most y=4, we are below y=7, so not on y=7 or 8, good.\n\nSimilarly, at t=85: position y_85.\n\nFrom above, if at t=84 y_84 <=4, then y_85 <=5 if up.\n\nSimilarly, t=86 y_86 <=6.\n\nAll less than 7, so not on y=7 or 8 at t=84,85,86 automatically, since we are too low.\n\nIs that right?\n\ny_84 <=4, y_85 <=5, y_86 <=6, all <=6, so on freeways 1-6, not 7 or 8.\n\nAnd freeways 1-6 have no collision after t=80, so safe.\n\nThen we can continue up to y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=80 y=0, if we go up every turn:\n\nt=80: y=0\n\na_80=U: y_81=1\n\nt=81: y=1\n\na_81=U: y_82=2\n\nt=82: y=2\n\na_82=U: y_83=3\n\nt=83: y=3\n\na_83=U: y_84=4\n\nt=84: y=4\n\na_84=U: y_85=5\n\nt=85: y=5\n\na_85=U: y_86=6\n\nt=86: y=6\n\na_86=U: y_87=7\n\nt=87: y=7\n\na_87=U: y_88=8\n\nt=88: y=8\n\na_88=U: y_89=9\n\nNow at t=87, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nBut freeway 7 has collision at t=84,85,86? t=87 is later.\n\nt=87: Δt = t - t_1 = 87 - 78 =9\n\nFreeway 7: car3: [-35 + 4*9, -24 + 4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], no 0\n\nCar1 and car2 positive, so no collision at t=87 on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, t=88 y=8, freeway 8, same, no collision.\n\nt=89 y=9, safe.\n\nBut we have collisions? In this path, at t=84 y=4, safe; t=85 y=5, safe; t=86 y=6, safe.\n\nt=87 y=7, safe as above.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nBut earlier at t=80 we avoided by being at y=0.\n\nIn this path, we started from t=80 y=0.\n\nNow, total from start: at t=78 y=0.\n\nWe need to get to t=80 y=0.\n\nWith two actions: either SS or UD.\n\nIn terms of time, both take two turns to be at t=80 y=0.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, it takes 9 more turns, reaching at t=89 y=9.\n\nWith actions from t=80 to t=88, 9 actions.\n\nTotal turns from t=78: at t=78, action a_78, then positions up to y_89 at t=89.\n\nH=12 turns: actions from t=78 to t=89? Let's count.\n\nt=78: action a_78\n\n...\n\nup to action a_88, then y_89=9.\n\nSo actions at t=78 to t=88, that's 11 actions? t=78 to t=88 inclusive is 11 turns.\n\nList: turns for actions: t=78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88 for 11 actions, position at t=89=9.\n\nSince y_89=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =89, t_1=78, so 78 + H -1 =89, thus H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut minimal possible is 9, but we have to avoid t=80.\n\nIn this path, we used 12 turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can be faster.\n\nEarlier I thought at t=84,85,86 we are low, so no issue, but we reached late.\n\nCan we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, from t=80 y=0, if we could be higher earlier, but at t=84 we are y=4 max, so we cannot reach y=9 before t=89? From y=0 at t=80, min to y=9 is 9 turns: y_89=9.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but at t=80 we are at y=0.\n\nBut at t=78 we could have gone up.\n\nt=78 y=0.\n\nIf we go up at t=78: a_78=U, y_79=1\n\nThen at t=79, y=1, which is safe as no collision.\n\nBut we need y_80=0 to avoid t=80 collision on y=1-6.\n\nSo if at t=79 y=1, we must go down, a_79=D, y_80=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf we stay at t=78: a_78=S, y_79=0, then a_79=S, y_80=0.\n\nIn both cases, we are at y=0 at t=80.\n\nNo way to be higher at t=80 safely.\n\nThus, we must be at y=0 at t=80.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 9 turns, reaching at t=89.\n\nBut t=89 is 78 + 11? t_1=78, t=89, difference 11 turns later? Position at t=89.\n\nt=78: y=0\n\nt=79: y=?\n\n...\n\nt=89: y=9, so 11 steps from t=78 to t=89? From t=78 to t=89 is 11 intervals, but 12 positions.\n\nTurn indices: at time t, position y_t.\n\ny_78=0\n\ny_89=9\n\nThe number of actions between: from t=78 to t=88 inclusive, actions a_78 to a_88, 11 actions, to set y_79 to y_89.\n\ny_79 = y_78 + Δy_78\n\ny_80 = y_79 + Δy_79\n\n...\n\ny_89 = y_88 + Δy_88\n\nSo after 11 actions, we have y_89 = 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer format, sequence of actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, a_{t_1}, y_{t_1+1} =? if up from 0, y=1, not 9.\n\nMin H=9: if from y_78=0, after 9 actions, y_{78+9} = y_87=9.\n\nBut in that case, with actions a_78 to a_86, 9 actions, y_87=9.\n\nBut we had collision at t=80, etc.\n\nIn our safe path, we have y_89=9 after 11 actions.\n\nNow, back to the later issue: in the path from t=80 y=0 to y=9, we go through y=7 at t=87, y=8 at t=88.\n\nBut at t=87 and t=88, no collision for freeway 7 and 8, as we calculated earlier, since collisions only at t=84,85,86.\n\nt=87: Δt=9, freeway 7 car3: [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12], no 0.\n\nSimilarly, so safe.\n\nThus, with H=11 actions: from t=78 to t=88.\n\nActions: we need to specify.\n\nFirst, to have y_80=0.\n\nWe can choose either SS or UD for t=78 and t=79.\n\nSince we want minimal H, and both take same time, we can choose SS to avoid moving.\n\nBut UD is also fine.\n\nThen from t=80 to t=88, all U.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nt_1=78.\n\nSequence for t=78 to t=78+H-1.\n\nH=11, so actions from t=78 to t=78+10=88? t_1 + H -1 = 78 + 11 -1 = 88.\n\nActions at t=78 to t=88.\n\nPosition at t=89=9.\n\nNow, for t=78 and t=79, we need actions to have y_80=0.\n\nOption: a_78 = S, a_79 = S\n\nThen y_79=0, y_80=0\n\nOr a_78 = U, a_79 = D, y_79=1, y_80=0\n\nThen a_80 to a_88 all U.\n\nBut at t=88, a_88=U, y_89=9.\n\nNow, we need to check if at any point we are on a row with collision.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=79: if we do UD, y_79=1, which is freeway 1, but at t=79, no collision, as span not include 0.\n\nIf SS, y_79=0, safe.\n\nt=80: y=0, safe.\n\nt=81: y=1, freeway 1, at t=81, Δt=3, freeway 1 span: [ -83 + 36*3, -48 + 36*3 ] = [ -83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other times, we are on y=1 to 6 before t=87, and y=7,8 after, all safe at those times.\n\nt=87: y=7, t=87, as above no collision.\n\nt=88: y=8, similarly safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier than t=89?\n\nFor example, if we start going up earlier, but we have to be at y=0 at t=80.\n\nSuppose at t=78, we go up, a_78=U, y_79=1\n\nThen at t=79, if we stay, a_79=S, y_80=1, but then at t=80, y=1, freeway 1, collision! Because freeway 1 collision at t=80.\n\nWe cannot be on y=1 at t=80.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, a_79=D, y_80=0, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at t=80.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=79, we go up, a_79=U, y_80=2, but then at t=80, y=2, freeway 2, collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo only way is y_80=0.\n\nThus, cannot reach faster.\n\nPerhaps we can go down at some point to save time later, but unlikely since we need to go up.\n\nAnother idea: for the later collision times, since we are forced to be low at t=80, we cannot be on y=7/8 at t=84,85,86 anyway, so no issue, but we reach late.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher when we pass y=7/8?\n\nFor example, if we delay or advance the time we are on y=7/8.\n\nBut in this case, from t=80 y=0, we reach y=7 at t=87, which is after t=86, so safe.\n\nIf we could reach earlier, but we can't because of the start constraint.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster after t=80, but we can only move one per turn, so min 9 turns from y=0.\n\nUnless we start from higher at t=80, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: at t=78, we are at y=0, but if we go down, we stay at 0, cannot go lower.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nStart t=78 y=0\n\nAfter H actions, y_{78+H} =9\n\ny_{78+H} = y_{t_1 + H} =9\n\nt_1 + H =78 + H\n\nSet to 9.\n\ny_{78} =0\n\ny_{79} = y_{78} + Δy_{78}\n\n...\n\ny_{78+H} = y_{78} + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{78+k}\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\nSince each |Δy| <=1, to increase by 9, H >=9.\n\nIn our case, with constraints, H=11.\n\nThe sum of Δy must be +9 over H actions.\n\nIn our path, for example, if we do SS then 9U, sum of Δy: for a_78 and a_79, if S and S, Δy=0, then a_80 to a_88: 9U, Δy= +1 each, so sum = 0 + 9 =9, y_{89} = y_{78} + sum =0+9=9.\n\nWith UD: a_78 U, Δy=+1, a_79 D, Δy=-1, sum=0, then 9U, sum=9.\n\nSame.\n\nNow, but in the UD case, at t=79, we are at y=1, which is fine.\n\nNow, but we have the freeway 7 and 8 collisions at t=84,85,86, but we avoid by being below.\n\nBut is there a way to reach in 10 turns?\n\nH=10, then y_{88} =9.\n\ny_{78+10} = y_{88} =9.\n\nBut from y_{78}=0, to y_{88}=9, we need net +9 in 10 actions.\n\nPossible, for example, with one down or stay, but since we need to go up, extra stay or down would require more up, but net must be +9.\n\nWith 10 actions, we can have some down or stay, but to reach +9, we must have exactly 9 up and one other, but since start and end, the other must be a down or stay that doesn't reduce, but if we have a down, we need an extra up to compensate.\n\nFor example, if we have 10 up, y_{88}=10, but y max 9, so cannot.\n\ny_{88} <=9 from y_{78}=0, since each step max +1, but y_{79}<=1, ..., y_{88}<=10, but y must be <=9, so if we go to 10, we hit boundary, but we can stay at 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=88, with min actions.\n\nFrom t=78 to t=88, 10 actions: a_78 to a_87? Actions a_t for t=78 to 87, 10 actions, set y_79 to y_88.\n\ny_79 = y_78 + Δy_78\n\n...\n\ny_88 = y_87 + Δy_87\n\nWe want y_88=9.\n\ny_78=0.\n\nSo sum from k=78 to 87 of Δy_k = y_88 - y_78 =9.\n\n10 actions, each Δy in {-1,0,1}, sum to 9, so must be 9 up and one stay, or 10 up but if 10 up, y_88=10, but y=10 not allowed, must be <=9, so we can have a stay at some point.\n\nFor example, 9 up and one stay.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, with H=10, we can reach at t=88.\n\nBut we have the constraint at t=80.\n\ny_80 must be 0.\n\nNow, from t=78 to t=80, two actions to have y_80=0.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen from t=80 y=0 to t=88 y=9, with 8 actions? Actions from t=80 to t=87 for y_88.\n\ny_88 = y_80 + sum_{t=80 to 87} Δy_t = 0 + sum\n\nSet to 9, so sum must be 9, with 8 actions? Actions at t=80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87 for 8 actions.\n\ny_81 to y_88.\n\ny_88 = y_80 + sum_{k=80}^{87} Δy_k\n\n8 terms, each <=1, so max y_88=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny_80=0, after 8 actions, y_88 <=8, since each step increase by at most 1.\n\ny_81 <=1, y_82<=2, ..., y_88<=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=88 from y=0 at t=80 in 8 actions; need 9 actions to reach y=9 at t=89.\n\nThus impossible to reach before t=89.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11, reaching at t=89.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from t=78 to t=88.\n\nWe can choose either SS or UD for the first two actions.\n\nTo minimize actions or just for the sequence, but since both same, we can pick one.\n\nPerhaps SS is simpler.\n\nOr UD might be fine.\n\nIn UD, at t=79 we are on y=1, which is safe, no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for the later part, all U.\n\nBut we need to write the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, for each turn.\n\nAlso, we need to confirm if at any point we have collision, but we think not.\n\nAnother thing: at t=87 y=7, we said no collision, but let's confirm freeway 7 at t=87.\n\nt=87, t_1=78, Δt=9.\n\nFreeway 7 cars:\n\nCar1: [37 + 4*9, 48 + 4*9] = [37+36, 48+36] = [73,84]\n\nCar2: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48]\n\nCar3: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12]\n\nAll positive, 0 not in, good.\n\nSimilarly t=88 y=8, same.\n\nt=89 y=9, safe.\n\nNow, the sequence.\n\nWe also have freeway 5 and 6, but no issue.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 4,5,6 have only one car each, same as before.\n\nBut in our path, we don't have problem.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write.\n\nTurn t_1 =78\n\nPlayer position: (0,0)\n\nWe need actions from t=78 to t=88.\n\nH=11, actions at t=78 to t=88.\n\nFor example, with SS:\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nThen Turn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nThen y_89=9.\n\nWith UD:\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: D\n\nThen same from 80 to 88 U.\n\nIn UD, at turn 79, after a_79=D, y_80=0, but at turn 79, position y_79=1, which is freeway 1, and at t=79, no collision, as we said.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can output one.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAlso, for the cars, we have freeway 7 and 8 with multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, at t=84,85,86 collision, but we are not there.\n\nBut in our path, we are on y=7 at t=87, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by going faster, but we can't.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately after t=80.\n\nBut no.\n\nPerhaps for the later part, since we have time, but we go up every turn, so it's min time from there.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's see if we can have a sequence with H=10, but we saw impossible.\n\nPerhaps by being on y=9 before, but no.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I'll choose the SS version for simplicity.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nThen at turn 89, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, up to turn 88 action.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut we need to specify.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have three cars, but we don't care.\n\nAnother point: in the collision rule, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and we did.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 84, y=4, which is freeway 4, but at t=84, freeway 4: let's confirm no collision.\n\nFreeway 4: at t=84, Δt= T - t_1 =84-78=6\n\nFreeway 4: right-moving, head -48, tail -71, s=24\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-71 + 24*6, -48 + 24*6] = [-71 + 144, -48 + 144] = [73, 96], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns H=11.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be written.\n\nNow, for the UD version, it's similar.\n\nBut I think SS is fine.\n\nTo save one action? No, both same H.\n\nIn UD, we have an extra move, but same number of turns.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 78: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=11, actions from t=78 to t=88.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to t=88.\n\nThen after that, at turn 89, position is 9.\n\nIn the task, it says \"reach (0,9)\", which is achieved at turn 89.\n\nBut the actions are for turns up to t=88.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows multiple lines.\n\nPerhaps write as text.\n\nBut in box.\n\nSince it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nt=0: a_{t_1}, t=1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nIn this case, t_1=78, H=11, so t from 0 to 10: a_{78} to a_{88}\n\nYes.\n\nSo the actions are for turn 78 to 88.\n\nNow, to confirm, with this, position at turn 89 is 9.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence to be on y=9 at turn 88, but we cannot, as shown.\n\nThus, this should be minimal.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 78\\) is 11. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway during its collision times.\n\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have collisions only at turn 80. To avoid this, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 80, which requires specific actions at turns 78 and 79.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 have collisions at turns 84, 85, and 86. Since the player is at low \\(y\\) values (at most \\(y = 6\\)) during these turns due to the late start from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 80, the player automatically avoids these collisions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is chosen to minimize \\(H\\) while satisfying the constraints:\n- Actions at turns 78 and 79: Stay (\\(S\\)) to reach \\(y = 0\\) at turn 80 without collision.\n- Actions at turns 80 to 88: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 89.\n\nThis results in the following action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 78: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, with y constrained between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has cars with positions that move over time. Collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and they move to y_{T+1}, they are only considered on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, not at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=80, and I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at turn 80.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car with head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed s=36. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-83 + 36(T-80), -48 + 36(T-80)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3: same car: (-48, -83, right, 36), so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: (-48, -71, right, 24), so span at T: [-71 + 24(T-80), -48 + 24(T-80)]\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nSpan for first car: [37 + 4(T-80), 48 + 4(T-80)]\n\nSecond car: [1 + 4(T-80), 12 + 4(T-80)]\n\nThird car: [-35 + 4(T-80), -24 + 4(T-80)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 80. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so it's safe. The freeways are from y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is above the freeways, so once at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nI need to move from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but avoiding being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nPosition 0 is the x-coordinate where the player is; the player is always at x=0, so we care about when a car's span includes 0.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn, I need to check if at that turn, for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars per freeway, if any car has 0 in span, it's a collision if player is on that freeway.\n\nPlayer is on freeway k only if y_t = k.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves up, but with cars, it might take longer if we have to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut moving down might not help if y=0 is safe, but we can only go down to y=0, not below.\n\ny min is 0.\n\nWe can stay or move to avoid being on a dangerous row at dangerous times.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the times when a freeway is dangerous (0 in some car span) change over time.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, the times when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, I need to find a path from y=0 at t=80 to y=9 at some turn, with minimal turns, such that at each turn t, when the player is on y_t, that row is safe at turn t.\n\nSince the player moves at each turn, and position changes, but the safety depends on the current y at current t.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number, starting from t1=80.\n\nAt turn t, player has position y_t, and we need that for that y_t, at turn t, 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nThen at turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nNow, for freeway k, the safety at turn t depends on the car positions at t.\n\nSince car positions are linear in time, I can find for each freeway the intervals when it is safe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span at T: [ -83 + 36(T-80), -48 + 36(T-80) ]\n\n0 is in this interval if:\n\n-83 + 36(T-80) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36(T-80)\n\nSo let’s solve for T.\n\nSet Δt = T - 80, so T = 80 + Δt\n\nThen:\n\n-83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 => 36 Δt ≤ 83 => Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.3055\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt => 48 ≤ 36 Δt => Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.3333\n\nSo Δt between 48/36 and 83/36, approximately 1.333 to 2.305, so for Δt = 2? Let's keep fractions.\n\n48/36 = 4/3 exactly? 48/36 = 24/18 = 12/9 = 4/3, yes 4/3.\n\n83/36, 83 and 36 no common factors, so 83/36.\n\nSo for Δt in [4/3, 83/36], which is [1.333, 2.305], so at integer Δt, Δt=2? Δt=2: 4/3≈1.333 < 2 < 2.305, so at Δt=2, T=82, it should be covered.\n\nΔt=1: 1 < 1.333? 1 < 4/3, so not in interval, safe.\n\nΔt=2: 4/3≈1.333 ≤ 2 ≤ 2.305, so unsafe.\n\nΔt=3: 3>2.305, unsafe?

We can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=1 at t=81.\n\nBut we need to see where we are at critical times.\n\nSince t=82 is dangerous for rows 1-6, we should not be on rows 1-6 at t=82.\n\nSimilarly, for t=86-88, not on rows 7-8.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times.\n\nFor rows 1-6: unsafe only at t=82, so safe at all other times.\n\nFor rows 7-8: unsafe at t=86,87,88, so safe at other times.\n\nWe start at t=80, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to increase y by 9, and we can only change by at most 1 per turn, minimal turns is 9, but we may need to wait or detour.\n\nBut in this case, we can avoid the dangerous times by timing.\n\nFor example, to go from y=0 to y=1, we can be at y=1 at t=81 or later, but not at t=82.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only unsafe at t=82, we can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly for 7-8, unsafe only at t=86-88.\n\nNow, the critical point is to not be on y=1 to 6 at t=82, and not on y=7 or 8 at t=86,87,88.\n\nWe start at t=80, y=0.\n\nAt t=80, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we take action at t=80, which determines y at t=81.\n\nSimilarly, at t=81, action determines y at t=82, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the turns: let t be the turn index from 80 onwards.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each t, if y_t between 1 and 8, it is safe at that t.\n\ny_t=0 or 9 always safe.\n\nWe need y_{t_final} =9 for some t_final.\n\nMinimize t_final - 80, the number of turns.\n\nSince we start at y=0, end at y=9, the minimal possible is 9 turns, ending at t=89? t=80: y=0, after first action at t=80, y at t=81, and so on, up to y at t=89 if we go up every turn.\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStart: at turn t=80, position is (0,0), so y_{80} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{80}, y_{81} = y_{80} + Δy, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=80 + H, position y_{80+H}.\n\nWe need y_{80+H} =9.\n\nAnd we need for each t from 80 to 80+H-1, y_t is safe? t from 80 to 80+H.\n\nAt each turn t, we have y_t, and it must be safe at that turn.\n\nFor t=80, y_t=0, safe.\n\nThen at turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut y_{t+1} is the position at the next turn.\n\nSo the sequence of positions: y_{80}, y_{81}, ..., y_{80+H}\n\nWe need y_{80+H} =9, and for each i from 80 to 80+H, y_i safe at turn i.\n\ny_{80} =0, safe.\n\ny_{80+H} =9, safe.\n\nMinimize H.\n\nNow, H is the number of actions, from t=80 to t=80+H-1, and after H actions, at turn 80+H, we are at y=9.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most 1, to go from 0 to 9, H >=9.\n\nNow, the constraints: at t=82, y_{82} cannot be 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=86,87,88, y_t cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nNow, t=86,87,88 are specific turns.\n\nNow, let's see possible paths with minimal H=9.\n\nWith H=9, we go from y=0 at t=80 to y=9 at t=89.\n\ny at each turn: t=80:0, t=81:?, ..., t=89:9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and each step change by -1,0,+1, to go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps, we must have exactly 9 up moves, no down or stay, because if we have a down or stay, we need extra up to compensate, but minimal H=9 requires all up moves.\n\nIf we have a down or stay, we need at least one extra up, so H>9.\n\nTherefore, for H=9, the only possibility is to go up every turn: actions all U.\n\nThen positions: t=80: y=0\n\nt=81: y=1\n\nt=82: y=2\n\nt=83: y=3\n\n...\n\nt=89: y=9\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nAt t=82, y=2, which is freeway 2, and at t=82, row 2 is unsafe, as we found earlier. Collision.\n\nAlso, at t=86, y=6? Let's see: t=80:0, t=81:1, t=82:2, t=83:3, t=84:4, t=85:5, t=86:6, t=87:7, t=88:8, t=89:9.\n\nAt t=86, y=6, but row 6 is not unsafe at t=86; only row 7 and 8 unsafe at t=86-88.\n\nAt t=86, y=6, row 6: unsafe only at t=82, which is past, so safe at t=86.\n\nSimilarly, at t=87, y=7, but row 7 unsafe at t=87, collision.\n\nAnd at t=88, y=8, row 8 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo multiple collisions: at t=82, y=2 unsafe; at t=87 y=7 unsafe; at t=88 y=8 unsafe.\n\nTherefore, with all up in 9 turns, we have collisions, so not possible.\n\nThus minimal H must be greater than 9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, we must not be on y=1-6 at t=82.\n\nAnd not on y=7 or 8 at t=86,87,88.\n\nSince we start at t=80, y=0.\n\nt=82 is only 2 turns later.\n\nAt t=80, we are at y=0.\n\nWe can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at t=81, then at t=82, if we are on y=1, it is unsafe, so we must not be on y=1 at t=82.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, etc.\n\nBut we can be on other y at t=82.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, we could be at y=0 at t=82.\n\nOr y=7 or 8, but at t=82, rows 7 and 8 are safe, since unsafe only at t=86-88.\n\nSimilarly, y=9, but we are not there yet.\n\nSo at t=82, safe rows are y=0,7,8,9? But y=9 not reached.\n\ny=0,7,8 are safe at t=82.\n\nSimilarly, for t=86,87,88, safe rows are y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9? But y=9 safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nOne way is to delay or advance our position to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on low rows at t=82, we can stay at y=0 for a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, for high rows, we might arrive after t=88.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only unsafe at t=82, we can be on them before or after.\n\nSimilarly for 7-8.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence with minimal H.\n\nFirst, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe dangerous times are t=82 and t=86-88.\n\nt=82 is early, t=86-88 later.\n\nWe start at t=80, y=0.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1-6 at t=82, we can either:\n\n- Be at y=0 at t=82, by staying or moving down, but we can only stay since y=0 min.\n\n- Or be at y=7 or 8 at t=82, but to reach y=7 or 8 by t=82, we need to go up fast.\n\nFor example, from t=80 to t=82, we can reach y=2 at t=82 if we go up both times, but y=2 unsafe.\n\nOr reach y=0 by staying.\n\nOr reach y=1 by going up once and stay, but y=1 unsafe at t=82.\n\nPositions at t=82 depend on actions at t=80 and t=81.\n\nAt t=80, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{80}, y_{81} = 0 + Δy_{80}\n\nThen after a_{81}, y_{82} = y_{81} + Δy_{81}\n\nWe want y_{82} not in {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n\nPossible y_{82}: 0,7,8? But to be at y=7 at t=82, we need to go up 7 times in 2 steps? Impossible, max y at t=82 is y=2 (up,up).\n\nMin y=0 (stay,stay or down, but down to 0 same as stay).\n\ny_{82} can be 0,1,2.\n\ny=0,1,2 are all low, but y=0 is safe, y=1 and 2 are unsafe at t=82.\n\nSo only possibility is to be at y=0 at t=82.\n\nThus, we must have y_{82} = 0.\n\nTherefore, we need to stay at y=0 for the first two turns? Let's see.\n\nTo have y_{82} =0, since we start at y=0, we need to not go up, so either stay or down, but down to 0 same.\n\nSo actions at t=80 and t=81 must be S or D, but D at y=0 does nothing, so effectively S.\n\nSo we must do S at t=80 and t=81, so y_{81} =0 and y_{82}=0.\n\ny_{81}=0, y_{82}=0.\n\nAt t=82, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, after that, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=86,87,88.\n\nt=86 is at Δt=6 from t=80, so t=86.\n\nSimilarly, t=87= Δt=7, t=88= Δt=8.\n\nNow, at t=82, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=82 onwards, we are at y=0.\n\nThe next dangerous times are t=86,87,88 for y=7,8.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid those.\n\nLet me denote the time from t=82.\n\nSet t' = t - 80, so at t=82, t'=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t_final.\n\nt_final >= t=82 +9 =91 if we go up directly, but we can go faster? No, min 9 up moves.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at t=82, need 9 up moves to y=9.\n\nBut we may have to wait or something.\n\nPositions: at time t, with t' = t-80.\n\nBut since t=80 is start, and we have t=82: y=0.\n\nNow, let τ = t - 82, so at τ=0, t=82, y=0.\n\nThen at τ, y_τ.\n\nWe need y at some τ_final to be 9.\n\nAnd for each τ, y_{τ} must be safe at time t=82 + τ.\n\nNow, t=82 + τ.\n\nThe dangerous times: for y=7,8 unsafe when t=86,87,88.\n\nt=86 corresponds to τ=4 (since 82+4=86)\n\nt=87: τ=5\n\nt=88: τ=6\n\nSo at τ=4,5,6, y_τ cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal τ_final is 9, with all up moves.\n\nThen positions: τ=0: y=0\n\nτ=1: y=1\n\nτ=2: y=2\n\nτ=3: y=3\n\nτ=4: y=4\n\nτ=5: y=5\n\nτ=6: y=6\n\nτ=7: y=7\n\nτ=8: y=8\n\nτ=9: y=9\n\nNow, at τ=4, t=86, y=4, which is row 4, safe at t=86 since only unsafe at t=82.\n\nSimilarly, τ=5, t=87, y=5, safe.\n\nτ=6, t=88, y=6, safe.\n\nτ=7, t=89, y=7, but row 7 unsafe at t=89? t=89 is not 86-88, t=86,87,88 are unsafe for y=7,8.\n\nt=89 is safe for y=7,8.\n\nSimilarly, τ=8, t=90, y=8, safe.\n\nτ=9, t=91, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=4,5,6: t=86,87,88, y=4,5,6, which are not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nAnd at τ=7, t=89, y=7, which is safe because t=89 >88.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut we have to start from τ=0, t=82, y=0.\n\nIn terms of turns from beginning.\n\nRecall: at t=80 and t=81, we did S, so y=0 at both.\n\nThen from t=82 onwards.\n\nt=82: we are at y=0, and we take action a_{82}, etc.\n\nIn the sequence above, from τ=0: at t=82, position y=0, we take action to go to y=1 at t=83? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn t: position y_t at start of turn? Better to list y at each turn.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position before action or after? From the dynamics, at turn t, position is (0, y_t), then we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for collision, at turn T, we care about y_T, which is the position at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=80: y=0, safe\n\nt=81: y=0 (since we stayed), safe\n\nt=82: y=0, safe\n\nNow, we take action at t=82: if we go up, then y_{83} =1\n\nThen at t=83, y=1, which is safe, since only unsafe at t=82.\n\nSimilarly, in the τ sequence: at τ=0, t=82, y=0\n\nAfter action, y at t=83 is y_{83} = y_{82} + Δy_{82}\n\nIn the path I described:\n\nAt t=82: y=0\n\nAction a_{82} = U, so y_{83} =1\n\nAt t=83: y=1, safe (t=83 ≠82)\n\nAction a_{83} = U, y_{84} =2\n\nt=84: y=2, safe\n\na_{84} = U, y_{85} =3\n\nt=85: y=3, safe\n\na_{85} = U, y_{86} =4\n\nt=86: y=4, now t=86, y=4, row 4 safe at t=86\n\na_{86} = U, y_{87} =5\n\nt=87: y=5, row 5 safe at t=87\n\na_{87} = U, y_{88} =6\n\nt=88: y=6, row 6 safe at t=88\n\na_{88} = U, y_{89} =7\n\nt=89: y=7, row 7 safe at t=89 (since unsafe only 86-88)\n\na_{89} = U, y_{90} =8\n\nt=90: y=8, safe (t=90>88)\n\na_{90} = U, y_{91} =9\n\nt=91: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, H: we have actions from t=80 to t=90, that's 11 actions? Let's count.\n\nStart: t=80, position given.\n\nActions at t=80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90: 11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at t=91, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=80 to t=91, that's 12 turns? No.\n\nThe turns are the points in time.\n\nAt turn t=80, we start, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{80}, we go to t=81 with y_{81}.\n\nAfter a_{81}, to t=82 with y_{82}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t=80 + H with y_{80+H}.\n\nWe need y_{80+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions:\n\nAt t=80: action S, so y_{81} =0\n\nt=81: action S, y_{82} =0\n\nt=82: action U, y_{83} =1\n\nt=83: U, y_{84} =2\n\nt=84: U, y_{85} =3\n\nt=85: U, y_{86} =4\n\nt=86: U, y_{87} =5\n\nt=87: U, y_{88} =6\n\nt=88: U, y_{89} =7\n\nt=89: U, y_{90} =8\n\nt=90: U, y_{91} =9\n\nSo at turn t=91, y=9, reached with H=11 actions.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal is 9, but we spent two extra turns waiting at start.\n\nIs there a way with less?\n\nFor example, instead of staying at start, can we go up to higher rows before t=82?\n\nBut at t=82, we must not be on y=1-6, and since max y at t=82 is 2, only y=0,1,2 possible, and only y=0 safe, so we must be at y=0 at t=82, so we must have stayed at t=80 and t=81.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen from there, we go up directly to y=9 in 9 more turns, but we start from t=82 y=0, end at t=91 y=9.\n\nBut in the up sequence from t=82, we have y at t=86: y=4, t=87:y=5, t=88:y=6, all safe, and we reach y=7 at t=89, which is after the danger period for y=7,8.\n\nBut we have H=11 actions.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nFor example, after t=82, we go up faster, but we can only go one per turn, so min 9 up moves from y=0.\n\nUnless we start going up earlier, but we can't because of t=82 constraint.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be on y=7 or 8 before t=86, but we are stuck at low rows until t=82.\n\nAt t=80, we are at y=0.\n\nIf we go up at t=80 to y=1 at t=81.\n\nBut at t=81, y=1, which is safe since t=81 ≠82.\n\nThen at t=81, if we go up again, to y=2 at t=82, but t=82 y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at t=81, y_{82} =1, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down, to y=0 at t=82, which is safe.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nt=80: action U, y_{81} =1\n\nt=81: action D, y_{82} =0 (since from y=1 down to 0)\n\nThen at t=82, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, same as before, go up to y=9 in 9 turns.\n\nBut we used one up and one down, so net zero, but we have to go up later.\n\nIn this case: actions:\n\nt=80: U, y81=1\n\nt=81: D, y82=0\n\nThen t=82: U, y83=1\n\n...\n\nUp to t=90: U, y91=9, same as before, 11 actions to reach t=91 y=9.\n\nCompared to staying twice: S at t80 and t81, then U from t82 to t90, also 11 actions.\n\nNo saving.\n\nBut in the first way, we stayed at t80 and t81, then U from t82 to t90.\n\nt82 to t90 is 9 actions: t82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90? t82 to t90 inclusive is 9 actions? Actions at t82 to t90, that's 9 actions, to reach y91=9.\n\nPlus actions at t80 and t81, total 11 actions.\n\nSimilarly in the U-D way: t80 U, t81 D, then t82 to t90 U, same 11 actions.\n\nNow, but in the U-D way, we were at y=1 at t=81, which is safe, and then down to 0 at t=82.\n\nBut we still end up with same number of turns.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we could be at higher y earlier, but we can't because of t=82 constraint.\n\nAfter t=82, we go up, but at t=86-88, we need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the direct up path, we are at y=4 at t=86, y=5 at t=87, y=6 at t=88, all safe, and then y=7 at t=89, safe.\n\nBut we could go slower or faster.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at t=82, to reach y=9, min at t=91.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not waiting, but we have to wait to avoid t=82.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps we can go up to y=6 or something before t=82, but we can't because at t=82 we must be at y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=80: U to y=1 at t=81\n\nt=81: if we go U to y=2 at t=82, unsafe, not possible.\n\nIf we go S, y=1 at t=82, unsafe.\n\nOnly D to y=0 safe.\n\nSo no way to be above y=0 at t=82.\n\nThus, we must be at y=0 at t=82.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 9 turns, arriving at t=91.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to pass through y=7 and 8 after t=88.\n\nt=88 is last danger for y=7,8.\n\nIn the path, we are at y=6 at t=88, then y=7 at t=89>88, safe.\n\nBut can we be at y=7 or 8 before t=86?\n\nFor example, if we go up faster after t=82.\n\nBut we can only go one per turn.\n\nFrom t=82 y=0, after one up: t=83 y=1\n\ntwo: t=84 y=2\n\nthree: t=85 y=3\n\nfour: t=86 y=4\n\nfive: t=87 y=5\n\nsix: t=88 y=6\n\nseven: t=89 y=7\n\neight: t=90 y=8\n\nnine: t=91 y=9\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=85, for example: from t=82 y=0, at t=85, after 3 actions, max y=3, so y=7 not possible early.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at high y before t=86.\n\nThus, the only way is to be below y=7 at t=86,87,88.\n\nIn this case, at t=86, y=4<7, safe; t=87 y=5<7, safe; t=88 y=6<7, safe.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut we have H=11.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the danger for y=7,8 at t=86-88, but in this path we are not on them, so no issue.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nWith H=10 actions, we reach at t=90 with y=9? t=80 +10 =90, y_{90}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{90}=9, we need 9 up moves in 10 actions, so one down or stay.\n\nBut since we start from y=0, and end at y=9, net +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and number of S can be some.\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay, with U + D + S = H, and U - D = 9.\n\nThen U = 9 + D, so H = U + D + S = 9 + D + D + S = 9 + 2D + S >=9.\n\nFor H=10, 9 + 2D + S =10, so 2D + S =1, so either D=0 and S=1, or D=1 and S=-1 impossible, so D=0, S=1.\n\nThus one stay and nine up, in some order.\n\nBut we must be at y=0 at t=82.\n\nNow, with H=10 actions, we reach at t=90.\n\ny at t=90=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=0 at t=82.\n\nt=82 is after 2 actions from start? Actions at t=80 and t=81 determine y at t=82.\n\ny_{82} must be 0.\n\nWith the actions, we have to have y_{82}=0.\n\nIn the sequence with one stay and nine up.\n\nBut to have y_{82}=0, since we start at y=0, we need that the net movement to t=82 is zero.\n\nFrom t=80 to t=82, two actions.\n\nIf both S, y=0.\n\nIf one U and one D, y=0.\n\nIf U and S, y=1, not 0.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations not zero.\n\nSo for y_{82}=0, we need actions at t=80 and t=81 such that net Δy=0, so either both S, or one U and one D.\n\nThen, from there, we have to go to y=9 with 8 actions? Total H=10 actions.\n\nAfter t=82, we have 8 actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut to go from 0 to 9 in 8 actions, we need at least 9 up moves, but only 8 actions, impossible.\n\nWith H=10 actions total.\n\nActions: t=80,81,82,...,89.\n\n10 actions.\n\ny_{90} =9.\n\ny_{82} must be 0.\n\nThe actions from t=80 to t=81: two actions, must have net Δy=0 to have y_{82}=0.\n\nThen actions from t=82 to t=89: 8 actions, must change y from 0 to y_{90}=9.\n\nBut y_{90} depends on actions from t=82 to t=89.\n\nAfter action at t=89, y_{90} is set.\n\ny_{82} =0.\n\nThen after a_{82}, y_{83} = y_{82} + Δy_{82}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{89}, y_{90} = y_{89} + Δy_{89}\n\nWe need y_{90} =9.\n\nThe sum of Δy from t=82 to t=89 must be +9.\n\nThere are 8 actions: from t=82 to t=89 inclusive? Actions at t=82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89: that's 8 actions.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,+1.\n\nSum of Δy over these 8 actions must be +9.\n\nBut each <=1, so max sum is 8, which is less than 9, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 from y=0 in 8 actions.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, it is impossible to have y_{90}=9 and y_{82}=0.\n\nIf we don't have y_{82}=0, but we must, because otherwise collision.\n\nThus, H=10 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=11 is possible as we have.\n\nBut earlier with H=11, we reach at t=91.\n\nNow, back to the y=7,8 danger.\n\nIn the path, we are fine, but we can optimize for the later part.\n\nSince we have to be at y=0 at t=82, and then go up.\n\nBut at t=86,87,88, we need not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the direct up path, we are at y=4,5,6 which are safe.\n\nWe could, for example, go slower to be at lower y at those times, but not necessary.\n\nOr go faster, but we are already going max speed.\n\nAnother idea: after t=82, we could go up to y=6 quickly, then wait at y=6 until after t=88, then go up.\n\nBut y=6 is safe except at t=82, which is past.\n\nIn the current path, we are at y=6 at t=88, which is safe, then go to y=7 at t=89, safe.\n\nBut if we wait at y=6, it would take more turns.\n\nFor example, from t=82 y=0, go up to y=6 by t=88? t=82: U to y=1 at t=83? Let's see.\n\nTo reach y=6 at some time.\n\nFor instance, at t=88, we want y=6.\n\nFrom t=82 y=0, to y=6 at t=88, that takes 6 up moves in 6 actions: from t=82 to t=87 actions.\n\nActions at t=82: U, y83=1\n\nt=83: U, y84=2\n\nt=84: U, y85=3\n\nt=85: U, y86=4\n\nt=86: U, y87=5\n\nt=87: U, y88=6\n\nThen at t=88, y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nThen from here, we can go up to y=9 in 3 more turns: t=88: U, y89=7; t=89: U, y90=8; t=90: U, y91=9.\n\nBut now we have more actions: from start, we had t=80 and t=81 S, then t=82 to t=87 U (6 actions to y=6 at t=88), then t=88 to t=90 U to y=9 at t=91.\n\nActions: t=80 S, t=81 S, t=82 U, t=83 U, t=84 U, t=85 U, t=86 U, t=87 U, t=88 U, t=89 U, t=90 U. That's 11 actions, same as before, reach t=91.\n\nBut in this, at t=86: y=4 (from above, t=86: y=4), safe; t=87: y=5, safe; t=88: y=6, safe; same as before.\n\nNo saving.\n\nTo avoid the y=7,8 danger, but in this case it was not an issue.\n\nBut suppose we wanted to be at y=7 at t=89, which we are.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nBut we also have freeway 7 and 8 with multiple cars, but we only care about when 0 is covered.\n\nIn freeway 7 and 8, we have unsafe at t=86,87,88, which we avoided by not being on y=7 or 8 at those times.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nPerhaps we can start going up later or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=80, we go up to y=1, then at t=81, instead of down, we could... but we have to go to y=0 at t=82.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by having some down moves to wait, but that would increase H.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=3 by t=83, but at t=82 we must be at y=0, so not possible.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, with two S at start, then all U.\n\nBut in the action sequence.\n\nAlso, for the car on freeway 7 and 8, we have three cars, but only the third one affects, as we saw.\n\nBut in the path, we don't go to y=7 or 8 until after t=88.\n\nNow, the player position: at each turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t=80: position y=0, we take action S (since we need to stay or something, but to have y=0 at next)\n\nIn my first plan: at t=80, action S, so y81=0\n\nt=81, action S, y82=0\n\nt=82, action U, y83=1\n\nt=83, U, y84=2\n\nt=84, U, y85=3\n\nt=85, U, y86=4\n\nt=86, U, y87=5\n\nt=87, U, y88=6\n\nt=88, U, y89=7\n\nt=89, U, y90=8\n\nt=90, U, y91=9\n\nNow, at each turn, the y_t:\n\nt=80: y=0, safe\n\nt=81: y=0, safe\n\nt=82: y=0, safe\n\nt=83: y=1, freeway 1, safe? At t=83, row 1: unsafe only at t=82, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=84: y=2, row 2 safe at t=84\n\nt=85: y=3, row 3 safe\n\nt=86: y=4, row 4: unsafe only at t=82, so safe at t=86\n\nt=87: y=5, row 5 safe\n\nt=88: y=6, row 6 safe\n\nt=89: y=7, row 7: unsafe at t=86,87,88, but t=89>88, so safe? t=89 not in 86-88, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=90: y=8, safe\n\nt=91: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, H=11 actions.\n\nBut the turn when we reach y=9 is t=91, which is turn 91.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence of actions from t=80 to t=90.\n\nt=80 to t=90 inclusive, 11 actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose we don't stay at start, but as before, impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at t=82 with different, but same.\n\nAnother idea: at t=80, go U to y=1 at t=81\n\nt=81, go D to y=0 at t=82\n\nThen same as before.\n\nThen from t=82 y=0, go up with one stay somewhere to have H=10 total.\n\nBut total actions H=10.\n\nThen y_{90}=9.\n\ny_{82}=0.\n\nThen from t=82 to t=89, 8 actions to go from y=0 to y_{90}=9.\n\nBut with 8 actions, max y increase 8, to y=8, cannot reach y=9.\n\nThus impossible.\n\nTherefore minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can use the one with two S at start or one U and one D.\n\nBut in terms of number of actions, same.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose.\n\nIn the U and D way, at t=81 we are at y=1, which is safe, but we go down immediately.\n\nBut it doesn't save time.\n\nSince the problem asks for minimal H, and sequence.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for freeway 7 and 8, at t=86,87,88, they are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nWe can use the S,S then U all.\n\nOr to have fewer S, but not necessary.\n\nNow, another point: at t=86,87,88, if we were on y=7 or 8, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn our path, fine.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier by being on y=7 before t=86?\n\nFor example, suppose we could be at higher y at t=82, but impossible as max y=2.\n\nAfter t=82, we go up faster, but cannot.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=6 by t=87, but then at t=88 y=6, then to y=9 at t=90? But from y=6 to y=9 takes 3 turns.\n\nt=88 y=6, t=89 y=7, t=90 y=8, t=91 y=9, same.\n\nNo saving.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's specify.\n\nIn the initial state, turn t1=80.\n\nPlayer position (0,0)\n\nWe need actions from t=80 to t=90.\n\nWith actions: for example, all U except first two S.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nTurn t_1: t=80\n\nAction a_{80}\n\nThen a_{81}, ..., up to a_{90} for H=11 actions.\n\nThen y_{91}=9.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nThen at turn 91, position (0,9)\n\nIn the action, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nPerhaps we can start with U and then D, but same H.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach with H=10 by not going to y=0 at t=82, but we must.\n\nAnother thought: but at t=82, for freeway 1,2,3,4,5,6, only unsafe if y=1-6 and t=82.\n\nBut if we are on y=7 or 8 at t=82, it is safe, but we cannot reach y=7 at t=82 from y=0 at t=80 in two steps.\n\nImpossible.\n\nThus, no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think S,S then U all is fine.\n\nBut in the car update, for freeway 7 and 8, we have cars, but in our path we don't hit them.\n\nNow, the answer should be the actions.\n\nBut let's write the sequence from t=80 to t=90.\n\nIn the format.\n\nAlso, note that for freeway 7 and 8, at t=86,87,88, they are unsafe, but since we are not on them, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=89 we are on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 11.\n\nSequence of actions: for turn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nBut after a_{90}, y_{91}=9, reached.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nBut the action for turn t_1 + t, etc.\n\nt_1=80.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 80: a_{80} = S\n\nTurn 81: a_{81} = S\n\nTurn 82: a_{82} = U\n\nTurn 83: a_{83} = U\n\nTurn 84: a_{84} = U\n\nTurn 85: a_{85} = U\n\nTurn 86: a_{86} = U\n\nTurn 87: a_{87} = U\n\nTurn 88: a_{88} = U\n\nTurn 89: a_{89} = U\n\nTurn 90: a_{90} = U\n\nAnd that's 11 actions.\n\nWe can have the U-D at start:\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nThen Turn 82: U\n\n...\n\nSame from there, but at turn 81, we go to y=1, which is safe, then down to 0.\n\nBut in terms of actions, it has a D, which might be unnecessary, but same H.\n\nI think S and S is simpler.\n\nBut in the sequence, both are fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, at t=89, y=7, is it safe?\n\nt=89, freeway 7: cars, we need to check if 0 in span at t=89.\n\nFrom earlier, for freeway 7, unsafe only at t=86,87,88.\n\nt=89: Δt=9, for third car: lower= -35 + 4*9 = -35+36=1, upper= -24+36=12, 1<=0<=12 false, so not covered.\n\nOther cars don't cover, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11 with the sequence above.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 80\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. This requires 11 actions from turn 80 to turn 90, reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 91.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n- At turn 82, freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe due to car collisions. Therefore, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 82 to avoid collision.\n- At turns 86, 87, and 88, freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe. The player must avoid being on these rows during these turns.\n- The player starts at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 80, which is safe (no cars at \\(y = 0\\)).\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\), at least 9 upward moves are required, but the constraints necessitate waiting at the start to avoid the unsafe condition at turn 82.\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence:\n- Actions at turns 80 and 81 must keep the player at \\(y = 0\\) to ensure safety at turn 82. Choosing \"S\" (stay) for both turns achieves this.\n- From turn 82 onward, the player moves upward (\"U\") at every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. The upward path avoids the unsafe periods for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) by being at lower rows (\\(y = 4, 5, 6\\)) during turns 86–88, which are safe for those rows at those times.\n- At turn 91, \\(y = 9\\) is reached, which is safe (no cars at \\(y = 9\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=80}^{90}\\) is as follows:\n\n- Turn 80: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\), safe.\n- Turn 81: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\)), safe.\n- Turn 82: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 83), safe as \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at turn 82.\n- Turn 83: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 84), safe as \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe only at turn 82.\n- Turn 84: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 85), safe as \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only at turn 82.\n- Turn 85: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 86), safe as \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe only at turn 82.\n- Turn 86: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 87), safe as \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe only at turn 82.\n- Turn 87: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 88), safe as \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at turn 82.\n- Turn 88: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 89), safe as \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe only at turns 86–88, and turn 89 is safe.\n- Turn 89: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 90), safe as \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at turns 86–88, and turn 90 is safe.\n- Turn 90: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 91), safe.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 82**: Player at \\(y = 0\\) (safe), avoiding unsafe rows 1–6.\n- **Turns 86–88**: Player at \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) (safe for these rows at these times), avoiding unsafe rows 7–8.\n- **Turn 91**: Player reaches \\(y = 9\\) (safe).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible:\n- \\(H = 9\\) or \\(H = 10\\) would require being at \\(y = 1\\)–\\(6\\) at turn 82 or failing to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer than 9 upward moves after turn 82, both of which are impossible while satisfying constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 82. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving up, down, or staying, while avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car movements: for each car, given its position at turn t_1, I need to compute where it will be at future turns. The collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you only check for collisions on the row you're currently on.\n\nThe player position updates at each turn: if you move up, y increases by 1; down, decreases by 1; stay, same y. And y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on specific freeways, and they move left or right with a constant speed. The span is given as [head, tail] for left-moving or [tail, head] for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t) = [h, τ] and at T, it's [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]. Since it's left-moving, decreasing x, so h and τ decrease.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t) = [τ, h]? No: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) is given as [τ, h], which might be [tail, head], but in the update, for right-moving, both τ and h increase, so [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nBut in the collision, it's about whether 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway you're on.\n\nAlso, cars are on specific freeways, so for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, but in this case, freeways 1 to 8 have cars listed.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway at t_1:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) — direction is right, so it's right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4) all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have the same cars? Probably different freeways, but same car descriptions.\n\nNow, since all cars are right-moving, and we care about when 0 is in their span.\n\nThe player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway with cars; cars are on y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no collision possible. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars there.\n\nBut when moving, if the player is on y=k for k=1 to 8, and at that turn, for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span, collision occurs.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9, so must pass through y=1 to 8, but can stay or move vertically.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want to go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid times when on a row, a car is at x=0.\n\nSince moving up takes time, and I might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since from y=0 to y=9, if I always go up, it takes 9 turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut I start at turn t_1, position (0,0), after one up move, at t_1+1, I'm at (0,1), and so on, up to at t_1+9, I'm at (0,9).\n\nBut at each intermediate turn, when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to not collide with cars there.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to compute if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, their positions change over time.\n\nDefine ΔT = T - t_1, so at time T = t_1 + ΔT, the span for a car can be computed.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial span [τ, h] at t_1, at T, span is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving, so only right-moving case.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [tail, head], I think, since τ is tail, h is head? But in the notation, it's a bit messy.\n\nFor freeway 1 car: at t_1, span is (-48, -83, right, 36), but it says \"cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", so for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -83? But that seems odd because -48 > -83, so if head is at -48 and tail at -83, since it's right-moving, head should be on the right, but -48 is to the right of -83? No, on the number line, smaller x is left, larger x is right.\n\nx=0 is the player's x, I assume.\n\nSo for a car, if it's right-moving, head is at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nBut in freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -83. Since -48 > -83, so head at x=-48, tail at x=-83, and since -48 > -83, head is to the right of tail, so it's facing right, moving right.\n\nAt t_1, span is from x= -83 to x= -48? Tail at -83, head at -48, so the car occupies from min to max, so from τ to h, which is -83 to -48.\n\nAnd since direction right, moving right.\n\nAt time T, span becomes [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-83 + 36 ΔT, -48 + 36 ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n0 is in span if -83 + 36 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 36 ΔT? No.\n\nThe span is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT], which for this car is [ -83 + 36 ΔT, -48 + 36 ΔT ]\n\nSince it's an interval, 0 is in it if lower <= 0 <= upper, so:\n\n-83 + 36 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 36 ΔT\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow for freeway 1, only one car, so at turn T, collision if 0 is in that span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same car parameters, so same behavior.\n\nFreeway 4: head = -48, tail = -71, speed 24, right-moving.\n\nTail τ = -71, head h = -48? -71 < -48, so τ = -71, h = -48, so span at t_1: [-71, -48] approximately.\n\nAt T: [ -71 + 24 ΔT, -48 + 24 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 24 ΔT\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, speed=4, right-moving. So at t_1, span [37,48] since τ=37, h=48.\n\nAt T: [37 + 4 ΔT, 48 + 4 ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 37 +4ΔT <=0<=48+4ΔT? But 37+4ΔT is at least 37>0 for ΔT>=0, so never <=0, so 0 is never in this span because the car is always to the right of x=0? 37 to 48, both positive, so for all ΔT, lower bound 37+4ΔT >=37>0, so 0 not in [37+4ΔT, 48+4ΔT], since min is >0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 7: head=12, tail=1, speed=4, right-moving. Span at t_1: [1,12], at T: [1+4ΔT, 12+4ΔT], all positive, min 1>0, so never contains 0.\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, speed=4, right-moving. Tail τ=-35, head h=-24, so span at t_1: [-35, -24], at T: [-35 +4ΔT, -24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, same thing.\n\nNow, for freeways 1,2,3: all have the same car: head=-48, tail=-83, speed=36, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 + 36 ΔT, -48 + 36 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-83 + 36 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 36 ΔT\n\nWhich is:\n\n-83 + 36 ΔT <= 0  => 36 ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <= 2 since integer? ΔT is integer, turns.\n\nT - t_1, so ΔT = 0,1,2,... integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 36 ΔT => 48 <= 36 ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >= 2? Since integer.\n\nLet's solve inequalities:\n\n-83 + 36 ΔT <= 0 => 36 ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 = 2 + 11/36 ≈ 2.305, so for integer ΔT, ΔT <= 2\n\n0 <= -48 + 36 ΔT => 48 <= 36 ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >= 2\n\nThus, both inequalities: ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only at ΔT=2, 0 is in the span.\n\n-83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 <=0, yes\n\n-48 + 36*2 = -48 + 72 = 24, 0 <=24, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1: -83+36= -47 <=0, true; but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not satisfied.\n\nAt ΔT=3: -83+108=25 <=0? 25<=0 false, and 0<= -48+108=60 true, but first false.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2 for freeways 1,2,3, collision if player is on that row at that time.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4,5,6: head=-48, tail=-71, speed=24.\n\nSpan at T: [ -71 + 24 ΔT, -48 + 24 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-71 + 24 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 24 ΔT\n\nFirst: -71 +24ΔT <=0 => 24ΔT <=71 => ΔT <=71/24≈2.958, so ΔT<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +24ΔT => 48 <=24ΔT => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT=2: -71+48= -23 <=0, true; 0 <= -48+48=0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1: -71+24= -47 <=0 true; 0 <= -48+24= -24? false\n\nΔT=3: -71+72=1 <=0? false; 0 <= -48+72=24 true, but first false.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2 for freeway 4,5,6.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: span [37+4ΔT, 48+4ΔT], min 37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: [1+4ΔT,12+4ΔT], min 1>0, 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: [-35 +4ΔT, -24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4ΔT <=0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: -35+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=35/4=8.75, so ΔT<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +4ΔT => 24 <=4ΔT => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT=6,7,8\n\nCheck:\n\nΔT=6: -35+24= -11 <=0 true; 0 <= -24+24=0 true\n\nΔT=7: -35+28= -7 <=0 true; 0 <= -24+28=4 true\n\nΔT=8: -35+32= -3 <=0 true; 0 <= -24+32=8 true\n\nΔT=5: -35+20= -15 <=0 true; 0 <= -24+20= -4? false\n\nΔT=9: -35+36=1 <=0? false; 0 <= -24+36=12 true, but first false.\n\nSo for freeway 7, collision if player on y=7 at ΔT=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as 7, collision at ΔT=6,7,8.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3: collision only at ΔT=2\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: collision only at ΔT=2\n\nFreeway 7,8: collision at ΔT=6,7,8\n\nNo other cars, and for other ΔT, no collision on those rows.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at ΔT=0 (turn t_1).\n\nAt each turn, player chooses action U, D, or S, changing y accordingly, with y between 0 and 9.\n\nGoal to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimal turns: if no obstacles, 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\nBut with collisions, need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, for rows 1,2,3: if at ΔT=2, player is on y=1,2, or 3, collision.\n\nSimilarly for rows 4,5,6: at ΔT=2, if on y=4,5,6, collision.\n\nAnd for rows 7,8: at ΔT=6,7,8, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\ny=7 and 8 are different rows, but both have collision at same times? Freeway 7 is y=7, freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nAt ΔT=6,7,8, if on y=7, collision; if on y=8, collision separately.\n\nPlayer needs to not be on row 1,2,3 at ΔT=2\n\nNot on row 4,5,6 at ΔT=2\n\nNot on row 7 at ΔT=6,7,8\n\nNot on row 8 at ΔT=6,7,8\n\nSince the collisions are only at specific times, I can plan the path to avoid those positions at those times.\n\nNow, ΔT is relative to t_1, so at absolute turn T = t_1 + ΔT.\n\nPlayer position at time T depends on actions taken from t_1 onwards.\n\nDefine the turn index: let t=0 be the first action at t_1.\n\nSet t such that at time t=0 (turn t_1), player is at y=0, and we choose action a_{t_1} which determines y at t=1 (turn t_1+1), and so on.\n\nStandard: at turn T, after action, position is for that turn.\n\nIn the update: at turn t, player has position y_t, then chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and cars at that turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision based on that.\n\nSo, at the beginning of turn T, player is at position y_T, then chooses action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut the collision is for the current position at turn T.\n\nIn terms of sequence:\n\n- At turn T, player is at (0, y_T)\n\n- Then, collision check: if y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, there is car with 0 in span at T, then collision.\n\n- If no collision, player chooses action a_T (U, D, S), which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, clamped to [0,9]\n\nThen next turn.\n\nStart at turn t_1, y=0.\n\nSince y=0, no car, no collision possible.\n\nThen choose action, go to turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn t_1 + H - 1, so after H-1 actions, y is 9.\n\nSet t=0 for turn t_1.\n\nSo at time t=0: position y=0, no collision (since y=0), choose action a_0.\n\nThen at t=1: position y_1, collision check based on y_1 and cars at t=1 (ΔT=1), etc.\n\nGenerally, at time t (turn t_1 + t), position y_t, ΔT = t, since T - t_1 = t.\n\nt is the time step from start.\n\nAt time t, ΔT = t.\n\nPosition y_t.\n\nIf y_t between 1 and 8, collision if for freeway y_t, at ΔT=t, 0 in some car span.\n\nOtherwise no collision.\n\nThen choose action a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H, with minimal H.\n\ny_t at time t.\n\nStart at t=0, y_0 = 0\n\nAfter actions, at time t, y_t.\n\nWe need to find min H such that y_H = 9.\n\ny_H = 9 means at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nIn the sequence, after H steps, at time H, y_H=9.\n\nBut at time H, if y_H=9, no car, so no issue.\n\nNow, the constraints to avoid:\n\nAt time t, if y_t = k, and for that k and t, collision condition.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor k=1,2,3: collision if t=2\n\nFor k=4,5,6: collision if t=2\n\nFor k=7: collision if t=6,7,8\n\nFor k=8: collision if t=6,7,8\n\nFor other t or other k, no collision.\n\nk is the row, t is time (ΔT).\n\nPlayer must not be on row 1,2,3 at t=2\n\nNot on row 4,5,6 at t=2\n\nNot on row 7 at t=6,7,8\n\nNot on row 8 at t=6,7,8\n\nSince rows 1-3 and 4-6 all have collision only at t=2, and rows 7-8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, min steps is 9, if I go up every time.\n\nBut at t=2, if I am on row 1,2,3 or 4,5,6, collision.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nt=0: y=0, no collision\n\na_0: U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=1, need to check collision at t=1. For y=1, at ΔT=1, is there collision?\n\nFor freeway 1, at ΔT=1: span [ -83 +36*1, -48 +36*1] = [-47, -12], 0 not in [-47,-12], since -47<0<-12 not true.\n\nSimilarly, no collision at t=1 for any row, since only at t=2 for 1-6.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, no collision, then a_1: U, to y=2 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=2, now at ΔT=2, y=2, which is freeway 2, collision! Because for freeway 2, at t=2, car has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=1 or y=3 at t=2, same.\n\nBut in this case, at t=2, y=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone slower, but at t=2, if I am on any of y=1 to 6, collision.\n\nSpecifically, y=1,2,3,4,5,6 all have collision at t=2.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, collision at t=2\n\ny=2: freeway 2, collision at t=2\n\netc.\n\nBut at t=2, if I am on y=0 or y=7 or above, no collision, but y=7 has collision later.\n\nBut at t=2, y=0 is possible if I stayed or went down, but I need to go up.\n\nMinimal path: at t=2, I must not be on y=1 to 6.\n\nPossible positions at t=2: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but not 1-6, so only y=0 or y>=7? y=7,8,9.\n\nBut from start, at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter two actions, y_2 can be from 0 to 2, since max up twice.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nAfter a0: y1 = min(9, y0 + Δy) , but since y0=0, y1 can be 0 (S or D? D would go to -1, but clamped to 0, I think.\n\ny_{t+1} = clamp( y_t + Δy, 0,9 )\n\nΔy: U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nSo from y=0, if a=D, y= max(0, 0-1)=0, since can't go below 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, if U, y=min(9,10)=9.\n\nSo y always between 0 and 9.\n\nAt t=0: y=0\n\nAfter one action, t=1: y1 can be 0 (if S or D) or 1 (if U)\n\nThen after two actions, t=2: y2 can be:\n\n- If y1=0, y2=0 (S or D) or 1 (U)\n\n- If y1=1, y2=0 (D), 1 (S), or 2 (U)\n\nSo possible y2: 0,1,2\n\nAll of which are between 0 and 2, so y2 <=2 <7, so at t=2, y2 must be 0 to avoid collision, since y=1 or 2 would be on row 1 or 2, collision at t=2.\n\ny=0 is safe, no car.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 is row 2, collision.\n\nSo at t=2, only safe if y2=0.\n\nBut y2=0 only if I stayed or went down, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nIf y2=0, then at t=2, no collision.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9 from there.\n\nBut time is passing, t increases.\n\nNow, similarly, for later times, the constraints at t=6,7,8 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, to avoid collision at t=2, I must have y2=0.\n\nThat means at turn t=2 (ΔT=2), position y=0.\n\nFrom start: at t=0, y=0.\n\nTo have y2=0, I need to not go up in the first two actions.\n\nSo possible actions: both S: y1=0, y2=0\n\nFirst S, then D: but from y1=0, D: y2=0\n\nFirst D: from y0=0, a=D, y1=0, then whatever, y2=0 or1 or2, but to have y2=0, need S or D.\n\nSimilarly, first U: y1=1, then to have y2=0, need a1=D, so y2=0.\n\nBut if I go up to y1=1 at t=1, then at t=1, y=1, which is freeway 1, at ΔT=1, is there collision?\n\nAt t=1, ΔT=1, for freeway 1: car span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for other rows, at t=1, no collisions anywhere, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo at t=1, if y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, if I go down to y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=0 both times, safe.\n\nBut if I go up to y=1 at t=1, then down to y=0 at t=2, I am at y=0 at t=2, no collision.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, time is t=2, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut now I have lost two turns, so minimal H will be larger.\n\nWithout constraints, min H=9, but with this, at least 10 or more.\n\nNow, also constraints at t=6,7,8 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's see possible paths.\n\nSince at t=2, I must be at y=0, I can choose to be there by moving down or staying.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut I also need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 are later times.\n\nNow, let me define the time from start.\n\nSet t such that at time t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nMust have y_2=0\n\nNow, y_2=0.\n\nThen at t=2, y=0, no collision, choose action.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe direct path would take 9 steps from t=0, but since I wasted two steps, it will be more.\n\nFrom t=2, y=0, I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 7 steps? From y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions, but since I start from t=2, I need to reach at some t=H.\n\ny_t at time t.\n\nAt t=2, y_2=0\n\nThen after actions, y_3, y_4, ..., up to y_H=9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=2 to reach y=9 is at least 7, since 9-0=9, but y_2=0, y_H=9, so H-2 steps to increase y by 9, so min H-2=9, H=11? Let's see.\n\nFrom time t=2 to time t=H, the number of turns is H-2, but each action changes y by at most 1, so to go from y_2=0 to y_H=9, need at least 9 actions, so H-2 >=9, thus H>=11.\n\ny at time t.\n\nAt time t=2, y_2=0\n\nThen at time t=3, y_3 after action at t=2, etc.\n\ny_H =9.\n\nThe change: y_H - y_2 = 9 - 0 =9, and each action can increase y by at most 1, so number of actions between t=2 and t=H-1? Actions at t=2,3,...,H-1 determine y_3 to y_H.\n\ny_t is set by action at t-1? Let's clarify.\n\nAt time t, position y_t is determined by previous actions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At time t=0: y_0 given, no action yet.\n\nAfter action a_0 at t=0, y_1 is set.\n\nAfter action a_1 at t=1, y_2 is set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k} at t=k, y_{k+1} is set.\n\nBut for collision, at time t, we have y_t, and check collision based on that.\n\nThen at time t, after collision check, choose action a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t=H, y_H=9, and since y=9, no collision, we stop.\n\nThe number of actions is from t=0 to t=H-1, and at time H, we are at y_H=9.\n\nWe need min H such that y_H=9.\n\nFrom y_0=0 to y_H=9, with each step |Δy| <=1, so min H=9.\n\nBut with constraints, we may need more.\n\nIn this case, because of t=2 constraint, we must have y_2=0, so from y_0=0 to y_2=0, no net change, so we wasted two turns, so to go from y_2=0 to y_H=9, min H-2=9, so H=11.\n\nBut we might be able to do better if we can be at higher y at t=2, but earlier we saw y_2 can only be 0,1,2, and 1,2 are unsafe, so only y_2=0 possible.\n\nUnless I can be at y=7 or higher at t=2, but from y=0, in two steps, max y=2, so impossible to be at y=7 at t=2.\n\nSo indeed, at t=2, only possible safe y is 0.\n\nThus, we must have y_2=0, and H >= 11.\n\nNow, similarly, we have constraints at t=6,7,8 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nNow, at t=6,7,8, if on y=7 or y=8, collision.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=7 at t=6,7,8 and not on y=8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, since we start late, t=2 at y=0, we need to go up.\n\nLet me plan the path from t=2 onwards.\n\nAt t=2, y_2=0\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 asap, but avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 are absolute times from start.\n\nSince t=2 is fixed, let me set τ = t - 2, so time from t=2.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=2), y=0\n\nThen at time τ, position y_τ relative.\n\nBut absolute time t = τ + 2.\n\nNow, collision times: for y=7, collision at t=6,7,8, which is τ=4,5,6 since t=τ+2.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, collision at t=6,7,8, so τ=4,5,6.\n\nt=6: τ=4, t=7: τ=5, t=8: τ=6.\n\nSo at τ=4,5,6, if on y=7 or y=8, collision.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMin steps: from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9, min 9 steps, so at τ=9, y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at τ=4,5,6.\n\nNow, possible to reach y=9 by τ=9 with no issues?\n\nBut let's see the position at τ=4,5,6.\n\nFirst, min path: always up.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0\n\na: U, to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, no issue (since rows 1-6 only issue at t=2, which is past)\n\na: U, to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, no issue\n\na: U, to y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, no issue\n\na: U, to y=4 at τ=4\n\nNow τ=4, y=4, not 7 or 8, so no collision, safe.\n\na: U, to y=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, not 7 or 8, safe\n\na: U, to y=6 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, not 7 or 8, safe\n\na: U, to y=7 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=7, but at τ=7, absolute t=2+7=9, now ΔT=9? t absolute.\n\nτ is offset, absolute time t = τ + 2.\n\nAt τ=4, t=6; τ=5, t=7; τ=6, t=8; τ=7, t=9; etc.\n\nNow, for y=7, collision at t=6,7,8, which is τ=4,5,6.\n\nAt τ=7, t=9, which is beyond t=8, so no collision for y=7 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 collision at t=6,7,8, τ=4,5,6.\n\nAt τ=7, t=9, no issue.\n\nIn the min path above:\n\nAt τ=4 (t=6), y=4, safe\n\nτ=5 (t=7), y=5, safe\n\nτ=6 (t=8), y=6, safe\n\nThen τ=7 (t=9), y=7, now t=9, ΔT=9, for freeway 7, at ΔT=9, cars: the third car, span [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], which is positive, 0 not in, so no collision. Similarly other cars, no issue. So safe.\n\nThen a: U, to y=8 at τ=8 (t=10)\n\ny=8 at t=10, ΔT=10, for freeway 8, cars similar, at ΔT=10, third car [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16], 0 not in, safe.\n\na: U, to y=9 at τ=9 (t=11)\n\ny=9, goal.\n\nNow, in this path, from τ=0 to τ=9, y from 0 to 9, with 9 actions, reaching at τ=9.\n\nBut absolute: at t=2, y=0\n\nAfter actions at τ=0 to τ=8 (t=2 to t=10), y at τ=9 (t=11) is 9.\n\nτ=0: action at τ=0 (t=2), sets y at τ=1 (t=3)\n\nSet times:\n\nAt absolute time t, position y_t.\n\nt=2: y=0\n\nChoose a_{t=2} (which is a_2 for absolute, but to avoid confusion, use absolute t.\n\nTurn: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nStart: T = t_1 = 82, but since relative, use T from 0 for simplicity, but T=0 is t_1.\n\nSet T=0 for turn t_1.\n\nSo at T=0: y=0\n\nT=1: after action, y1\n\n...\n\nWe have y_2 must be 0.\n\nIn the path above, with y_2=0.\n\nThen at T=2: y=0, choose action, say U, to y=1 at T=3? At turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then collision check, then action a_T sets y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn T=0: position y_0=0, no collision, choose a_0, which sets y_1\n\n- Turn T=1: position y_1, collision check, choose a_1, sets y_2\n\n- Turn T=2: position y_2, collision check, choose a_2, sets y_3\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn T=H: position y_H, if y_H=9, goal reached.\n\nWe need y_H=9 for some H.\n\nFrom above, y_2 must be 0 to avoid collision at T=2.\n\nIn the min path I thought:\n\nSuppose at T=0: y=0, choose a_0=S or D, to keep y=0? Or U then down.\n\nBut to have y_2=0.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: stay low.\n\nT=0: y=0, choose a_0=S, then y_1=0\n\nT=1: y=0, no collision (y=0), choose a_1=S, then y_2=0\n\nT=2: y=0, no collision, now choose actions to go up.\n\nNow from T=2, y=0.\n\nChoose a_2=U, then y_3=1\n\nT=3: y=1, no issue (since only t=2 has collision for low rows), collision check: at T=3, ΔT=3, for y=1, freeway 1, span [-83+36*3, -48+36*3]=[-83+108, -48+108]=[25,60], 0 not in, safe. Similarly.\n\nChoose a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nT=4: y=2, safe, a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, safe, a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, now T=6, ΔT=6, for y=4, freeway 4? Freeway 4 has cars, but at ΔT=6, for freeway 4 car: span [ -71 +24*6, -48 +24*6] = [-71+144, -48+144]=[73,96], 0 not in, safe. Similarly.\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, ΔT=7, freeway 5 car: similar, [-71+168, -48+168]=[97,120], no, safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, ΔT=8, freeway 6 car: [-71+192, -48+192]=[121,144], no, safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, now T=9, ΔT=9, for freeway 7: cars, the critical one is third car, span [-35+4*9, -24+4*9]=[-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, ΔT=10, freeway 8 similar, third car [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16], 0 not in, safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nT=11: y=9, goal.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut earlier I thought with the offset, but in this path, at T=6,7,8, y is 4,5,6, not 7 or 8, so no issue with high rows.\n\nIn this case, H=11.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nSince at T=2, I must be at y=0, and I need to go up, but perhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going up immediately after, but min is 9 steps from there.\n\nAnother way: at T=0, I could go up to y=1, then down to y=0 at T=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=0: y=0, choose a_0=U, then y_1=1\n\nT=1: y=1, no collision (as at ΔT=1, no collision), choose a_1=D, then y_2=0\n\nT=2: y=0, same as before.\n\nThen from T=2, same as above, go up, reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nSame H.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 for first two turns, same.\n\nNow, but at T=6,7,8, I need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the above path, at T=6, y=4; T=7, y=5; T=8, y=6; all safe.\n\nThen T=9, y=7; but T=9>8, so no collision for y=7 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in this path, H=11.\n\nIs it possible to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y at earlier times.\n\nBut at T=2, I must be at y=0, so I cannot start going up before.\n\nUnless I can avoid the collision by being on a different row at T=2, but only y=0 is safe, others are 1-6 which are all unsafe at T=2.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at T=2, but I can't reach them from y=0 in two steps.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus min H=11.\n\nBut in the answer, I need the sequence.\n\nBut there is also the constraint for rows 7 and 8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nIn this path, it's fine.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster by not going straight up, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7 and 8 have collision at t=6,7,8, I need to not be there at those times.\n\nIn the min path from T=2, I go up, at T=6 I am at y=4, which is fine.\n\nIf I go slower, I might be at y=7 or 8 at t=6,7,8, which is bad.\n\nFor example, suppose I waste more time early, then at T=6 I might be lower, but since I start from y=0 at T=2, if I go up slowly, at T=6 I might be at y=4 or less, but then it takes more turns to reach y=9, so H larger, worse.\n\nIf I go faster, but from y=0 at T=2, if I always up, at T=6, y=4 (since T=2 y=0, T=3 y=1, T=4 y=2, T=5 y=3, T=6 y=4).\n\nT=2: y=0\n\na2=U, y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1\n\na3=U, y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4\n\netc.\n\nTo reach y=9, at T=11, y=11? y_t at T.\n\ny_T at time T.\n\ny2=0\n\ny3=1\n\ny4=2\n\ny5=3\n\ny6=4\n\ny7=5\n\ny8=6\n\ny9=7\n\ny10=8\n\ny11=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nAt T=6, y=4; T=7,y=5; T=8,y=6; all not 7 or 8.\n\nAt T=9,y=7, but T=9>8, so for freeway 7, at ΔT=9, as before, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly T=10,y=8, ΔT=10, no issue.\n\nNow, but in this sequence, at T=1, I have y=1, which is fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, to have y2=0, I need to set it.\n\nFor example, one sequence:\n\nT=0: y=0, choose a0=S (stay), so y1=0\n\nT=1: y=0, choose a1=S, so y2=0\n\nT=2: y=0, choose a2=U, so y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1, choose a3=U, y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2, choose a4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, choose a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, choose a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, choose a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, choose a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, choose a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, choose a10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11: y=9, done. H=11.\n\nWith the down move:\n\nT=0: y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nT=1: y=1, no collision, a1=D, y2=0 (down to 0)\n\nT=2: y=0, no collision, a2=U, y3=1\n\n... same as above, from T=2 onwards.\n\nIn this case, at T=1, y=1, which is safe, as we said.\n\nBut same H=11.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=9 earlier? For example, at T=10?\n\nIf y10=9, then from y2=0, need to go to y10=9 in 8 steps, but min 9 steps? y2 to y10, 8 steps: actions at T=2 to T=9, setting y3 to y10.\n\ny10 set by action at T=9.\n\nTo go from y2=0 to y10=9, number of actions: actions at T=2 to T=9, that's 8 actions, each can increase y by at most 1, so max y10=8, not 9.\n\ny2=0\n\nAfter a2, y3 <=1\n\na3, y4<=2\n\n...\n\na9, y10<=8\n\nSo y10 <= 8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y9=9, actions from T=2 to T=8: 7 actions, y9 <= y2 +7 =7, not 9.\n\ny2=0\n\nAfter a2 (T=2), y3 <=1\n\na3 (T=3), y4 <=2\n\n...\n\na8 (T=8), y9 <=7\n\na9 (T=9), y10 <=8\n\ny10=9 only possible if y10=9, which requires at least 9 actions from start, but with y2=0, it takes until T=11 to have y11=9.\n\ny11=9 with actions from T=0 to T=10.\n\nMinimal H is 11.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm the high row constraints.\n\nIn the path above, at T=6,7,8: y=4,5,6, not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, but T=9>8, and ΔT=9, for freeway 7, no car at x=0, as computed.\n\nSimilarly T=10, y=8, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turn t_1, etc.\n\nt_1=82.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, I used S and U.\n\nBut in the down move version, I used D at T=1.\n\nBut both work.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the down move.\n\nBut since I need y2=0, I can choose to stay both times or go up and down.\n\nIn terms of actions, staying might be simpler.\n\nNow, about rows 7 and 8: in this path, I pass y=7 at T=9 and y=8 at T=10, both after the danger times t=6,7,8.\n\nBut what if I want to go slower or faster?\n\nFor example, if I go slower, say at some point I stay, then I might be at y=7 at T=8 or something.\n\nBut T=8 is t=8, which is danger for y=7.\n\nFor instance, suppose from T=2, I don't go up every time.\n\nBut that would make H larger, worse.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can't, because from y=0, I can only go up one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at T=0, I go up to y=1, then at T=1, instead of down, I could stay, but then at T=2, y=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nI must have y2=0.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nI need to specify for each turn.\n\nt_1=82.\n\nSo turns: 82,83,84,... up to 82+10=92? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T relative: T=0 is turn 82.\n\nAction at turn T determines y_{T+1}, but the action is at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence, we output actions for turns.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nAnd y at turn t_1 is given, then after actions.\n\nAt turn t_1=82, position is (0,0), then we choose action a_{82}, which sets y_{83}.\n\nThen at turn 83, position y_{83}, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach position (0,9) at some turn, say turn S, so y_S=9.\n\nAnd min S - t_1 +1?

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the initial state at turn t1 = 84. The player starts at (0,0) and wants to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules are:\n- For left-moving: the car span [h, τ] at time t1 becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at time T.\n- For right-moving: the car span [τ, h] (note: in the table, it's given as (head, tail) but for right-moving, the head is the leading part, so if moving right, the head is the rightmost? Actually, note the representation: for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head? But in the update, they write: for right-moving, [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] so the entire car moves right by s per turn.\n\nHowever, looking at the given car state, we see that for freeways 1 to 6, we have cars represented as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeways 7 and 8, we have three cars each.\n\nBut note the collision condition: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the vertical position at turn T) and the car on that freeway has 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant: The player moves at the same time as the cars. The update for the player is:\n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t is determined by the action at turn t.\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is at y (the starting freeway) and then moves to y' for the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and that's the freeway we check for collisions.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 84) for H turns, ending when we first reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H? We can only move one step at most per turn. So the minimal H without any cars would be 9 (from 0 to 9: 9 moves up). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway and for each car on that freeway, the set of times (relative to t1) when the car's span covers x=0.\n\nLet me denote:\n  t1 = 84\nWe are going to simulate turns T = 84, 85, ... until we get to 9.\n\nBut note: the player starts at y=0 at turn 84. We don't have to worry about cars at y=0 because there is no freeway 0? The freeways are from 1 to 8. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars. So we only worry when we are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is (0,9) and we are safe at y=9.\n\nSo the problem is: we start at (0,0) at turn 84. We can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nWe need the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. Precompute for each freeway (1 to 8) and each car on that freeway, the intervals of time (in absolute turns, or relative to t1) during which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the car spans are moving. For a right-moving car on freeway k, with initial head h, tail τ at t1, and speed s, then at time T (>= t1), the head is h + s*(T-t1) and the tail is τ + s*(T-t1). The span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe require that 0 is in [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving? But note: in our data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nAll cars have direction \"right\". So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nSo for a car (h, τ, right, s) at t1=84, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T-84), h + s*(T-84)].\n\nWe require:\n  τ + s*(T-84) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-84)\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving: in the table, it's given as (head, tail). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So we have τ <= h? Actually, in the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36). Here, head = -48, tail = -83. But note: -48 > -83. So actually, the head is the larger number? Because the car is moving right, so the head is at -48 and the tail at -83? But then the span is from -83 to -48? Then at time T, the car moves right: so the tail becomes -83 + s*(T-84) and the head becomes -48 + s*(T-84). Then the span is [ -83 + s*(T-84), -48 + s*(T-84) ].\n\nBut then we require 0 to be in that interval? But note: -83 + s*(T-84) <= 0 <= -48 + s*(T-84) ?\n\nBut wait: -48 is greater than -83, so the interval is [A, B] with A = -83 + s*(T-84) and B = -48 + s*(T-84). And since the car is moving right, A and B are increasing.\n\nSo the condition is:\n  A <= 0 <= B\n  => -83 + s*(T-84) <= 0 <= -48 + s*(T-84)\n\nBut note: -83 + s*(T-84) <= 0 implies s*(T-84) <= 83\nand 0 <= -48 + s*(T-84) implies s*(T-84) >= 48.\n\nSo for this car, we have:\n  48 <= s*(T-84) <= 83\n\nSimilarly, for the car on freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24). Then:\n  -71 + 24*(T-84) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-84)\n=> 24*(T-84) <= 71  and 24*(T-84) >= 48\nBut 48 <= 24*(T-84) <= 71 -> 48/24=2 <= (T-84) <= 71/24≈2.95 -> so T-84 must be 2? But 24*2=48, then at T-84=2: \n  -71+48 = -23 <=0<= -48+48=0 -> yes, 0 is included.\n\nBut note: at T-84=2, the head is -48+48=0, so 0 is at the head. This is included? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so yes.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 7 and 8, there are three cars.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway the set of absolute turns T (>=84) for which at least one car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned when the player is on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo we can precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) the set of dangerous times (in absolute turns) when the player should not be on that freeway.\n\nThen we simulate the player's movement: we are at y0=0 at T0=84. We can choose actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe state: (time, y) and we want to avoid (time, y) pairs that are dangerous for that y (if y between 1 and 8).\n\nWe can do a BFS in the state space: state = (t, y) where t is the absolute turn, and y is the current vertical position.\n\nBut note: the time t increases, and we are minimizing the number of steps.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. And we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe start at (84, 0). We want to reach y=9 at any time.\n\nWe must avoid states (t, y) for y in [1,8] that are dangerous: that is, at time t, freeway y has a car that covers x=0.\n\nWe must precompute for each freeway y in [1,8] the set of dangerous times.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nDefine:\n  t_rel = T - 84   (relative turn, starting at 0)\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car: (h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36)\n  Condition: -83 + 36 * t_rel <= 0 <= -48 + 36 * t_rel\n  => 36 * t_rel >= 48  => t_rel >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> so t_rel>=2 (since integer)\n  and 36 * t_rel <= 83 => t_rel <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> so t_rel<=2.\n\nSo only at t_rel=2? \n  Check: t_rel=2 -> tail: -83+72 = -11, head: -48+72=24 -> so [ -11, 24] which includes 0. So dangerous at t_rel=2 (absolute T=86).\n\nBut wait: t_rel=2: T=84+2=86. But what about t_rel=1? \n  t_rel=1: tail=-83+36=-47, head=-48+36=-12 -> [-47,-12] -> 0 not included. \n  t_rel=3: 36*3=108: tail=-83+108=25, head=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=86.\n\nFreeway 2: same car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> same as freeway1: dangerous only at T=86.\n\nFreeway 3: same: dangerous only at T=86.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48,-71,right,24)\n  Condition: -71 + 24 * t_rel <= 0 <= -48 + 24 * t_rel\n  => 24 * t_rel >= 48  => t_rel>=2\n  => 24 * t_rel <= 71  => t_rel <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 -> so t_rel=2,3? \n\n  Check t_rel=2: \n      tail: -71+48 = -23, head: -48+48=0 -> [-23,0] -> 0 is included? yes, at the head.\n  Check t_rel=3:\n      tail: -71+72=1, head: -48+72=24 -> [1,24] -> 0 not included? because 0 is less than 1.\n\n  Actually, condition: 0 must be >= tail and <= head. At t_rel=3, tail=1, so 0<1 -> not included.\n\n  So only t_rel=2 -> T=86.\n\nBut wait, the head is 0 at t_rel=2: that is included.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway4 -> dangerous at T=86.\n\nFreeway 6: same -> dangerous at T=86.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? But then the car is from 37 to 48? and moving right. So at time T, the car becomes [37+4*(T-84), 48+4*(T-84)].\n\nCondition: 37+4*(T-84) <= 0 <= 48+4*(T-84)\n\nBut note: 37+4*(T-84) is at least 37 at T=84, and increasing. So it's always positive? Then 0 cannot be in the interval. So this car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4): \n  Condition: 1+4*(T-84) <= 0 <= 12+4*(T-84)\n  => 1+4*(T-84) <=0 -> 4*(T-84)<=-1 -> impossible because T>=84 -> so never.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4): \n  Condition: -35+4*(T-84) <= 0 <= -24+4*(T-84)\n  => 4*(T-84) <= 35  -> T-84 <= 35/4=8.75 -> T<=92.75 -> T<=92\n  and 4*(T-84) >=24 -> T-84>=6 -> T>=90\n\n  So for T-84: 6 to 8.75 -> so t_rel = 6,7,8.\n\n  Check:\n    t_rel=6: tail=-35+24=-11, head=-24+24=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n    t_rel=7: tail=-35+28=-7, head=-24+28=4 -> [-7,4] -> 0 included.\n    t_rel=8: tail=-35+32=-3, head=-24+32=8 -> [-3,8] -> 0 included.\n    t_rel=9: tail=-35+36=1, head=-24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> no.\n\n  So dangerous at t_rel=6,7,8 -> absolute T=90,91,92.\n\nSo freeway 7 is dangerous at T=90,91,92.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7? The data is the same: \n  (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo same dangerous times: T=90,91,92.\n\nSummary of dangerous states (freeway, time):\n\nFreeway 1: T=86\nFreeway 2: T=86\nFreeway 3: T=86\nFreeway 4: T=86\nFreeway 5: T=86\nFreeway 6: T=86\nFreeway 7: T=90,91,92\nFreeway 8: T=90,91,92\n\nWe are at (t=84, y=0). We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (or Dijkstra, but all steps cost 1) to find the minimal steps.\n\nState: (t, y) and we record the path? Actually, we only need the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nBut note: the time t is increasing as we take steps. We are going to simulate step by step.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. The next state: (t+1, y') where y' = y+1 (if U), y-1 (if D), or y (if S), but bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe avoid states where if y' (the new y) is between 1 and 8 and at time t+1 (because at turn t+1, we are at y') and t+1 is dangerous for that freeway.\n\nBut note: when we take an action at turn t, the next position is at turn t+1.\n\nAt the current turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action, and then at turn t+1, we are at y'. And at that turn t+1, we check if y' is dangerous? Actually, we check the freeway y' at time t+1.\n\nBut note: the initial state: at turn 84, we are at y=0. We are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 84, y=0. Then we choose an action for turn 84, which will move us to y' at turn 85.\n\nSo at turn 85, we are at y'. Then we check: if y' is between 1 and 8, and if the time 85 is dangerous for that freeway, then we cannot be there.\n\nSimilarly, then we choose an action for turn 85, and so on.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some turn. The minimal H is the number of actions? Since we start at turn 84 and then we take H actions: at turn 84, 84+1, ... 84+H-1. Then at turn 84+H, we are at the new state. But we want the player to be at y=9 at the last action? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the player update: at turn t, we apply action a_t and then we get y_{t+1}. So after the last action (the (H-1)-th action in the sequence, applied at turn t1+H-1), we get y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we start at t1=84, and we take actions at t=84,85,...,84+H-1, and at time 84+H we are at y=9.\n\nWe can think: the state at time t (>=84) has a y_t. We take an action at time t to get to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo we are safe at time t if either y_t is 0 or 9, or if y_t is in [1,8] but the time t is not dangerous for freeway y_t.\n\nBut note: at the moment we are at a state (t, y_t), we are safe if either y_t is 0/9 or if for freeway y_t, the time t is not dangerous.\n\nBut in our simulation, we start at (84,0): safe.\n\nThen we take an action and go to (85, y85). Then we check (85, y85): if y85 is in [1,8] and 85 is dangerous for that freeway, then we cannot be there.\n\nWe want to get to (t,9) for some t, and then we stop.\n\nWe'll do BFS over states (t, y). Since the minimal H is at least 9 (to go from 0 to 9) and we can't go too high? But we might have to wait. The dangerous times are concentrated: at 86 for freeways 1-6, and at 90-92 for 7-8.\n\nWe'll consider states from t=84 up to, say, t=100 (we can extend if needed).\n\nWe want the minimal H, so we want the minimal number of actions (which is the same as the minimal number of steps in time) to get to y=9.\n\nBut note: we can also stay or move down to avoid.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1 to 6 at time 86? because at time 86, all freeways 1-6 are dangerous? Actually, the dangerous time for freeways 1-6 is only at 86? and freeways 7-8 at 90,91,92.\n\nBut note: we are going to move from 0 to 9. We have to pass through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe can plan:\n\nWe are at turn 84: y=0.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe minimal without obstacles: 9 moves up: \n  turn84: U -> y=1 at t85\n  turn85: U -> y=2 at t86 -> but at t86, freeway2 is dangerous? so we cannot be at y=2 at t86.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up at t84: to y=1 at t85 -> at t85, freeway1: is 85 dangerous? only 86 is dangerous for freeway1? so at t85, freeway1 is safe? \n  But then at t85, we are at y=1. Then we can choose: if we go up to y=2 at t86: that is dangerous because freeway2 at t86 is dangerous? \n  But note: at t86, we are at freeway2? so we get killed.\n\nAlternatively, at t85 we can stay? then we would be at y=1 at t86 -> freeway1 at t86 is dangerous? so we also get killed.\n\nOr at t85 we can go down? to y=0 at t86: then safe.\n\nBut then we are back at 0 at t86, and we have to start again.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 1 to 6 at t=86.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid being on freeways 7 and 8 at t=90,91,92.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\nWe can be on freeways 1 to 6 at any time except t=86, and freeways 7 and 8 except t=90,91,92.\n\nWe need to traverse from y=0 to y=9, and we can control the time we spend on each freeway.\n\nThe minimal time? We must take at least 9 moves up. But we might have to wait sometimes.\n\nWe can try to go as fast as possible until we hit the dangerous time.\n\nWe start at t84: y0=0.\n\nOption 1: at t84, go up to y1=1 at t85 -> safe (freeway1 at t85 is safe).\n\nNow at t85: we are at y1=1. We cannot be at y=1 at t86? So we must leave freeway1 by t86? That is, at t86 we must not be on freeway1? but we are at freeway1 at t85. To leave, we can go up to freeway2 at t86? but freeway2 at t86 is dangerous. Or we can go down to freeway0 at t86? which is safe. Or stay? then we remain at freeway1 at t86 -> dangerous.\n\nSo the only safe option at t85 is to go down to y0=0 at t86.\n\nThen at t86: we are at y0=0 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are back to 0 at t86. Then we have to start again.\n\nAt t86: we are at 0. Then we can go up at t86: to y1=1 at t87.\n\nNow at t87: freeway1 is safe? because the only dangerous time for freeway1 is t86? so yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2 to 6: we have to avoid t86? so at t87, they are safe.\n\nBut we have to worry about freeways 7 and 8: dangerous at t90,91,92.\n\nNow we can go up continuously until we hit freeway7 or 8.\n\nFrom t86: we are at 0. Then:\n\nt86: U -> y=1 at t87 (safe)\nt87: U -> y=2 at t88 (safe)\nt88: U -> y=3 at t89 (safe)\nt89: U -> y=4 at t90 -> at t90, we are at freeway4? but freeway4 is only dangerous at t86? so safe? \n  But wait: we are at freeway4 at t90? and freeway4 is not dangerous at t90? so safe.\n\nBut then we can continue:\n\nt90: U -> y=5 at t91 -> freeway5 at t91: safe? because dangerous only at t86? so safe.\nt91: U -> y=6 at t92 -> freeway6 at t92: safe? \nt92: U -> y=7 at t93 -> but freeway7 is dangerous at t90,91,92? so at t93, it's safe? \n  Then we can go to 7 at t93: safe.\nt93: U -> y=8 at t94 -> freeway8 at t94: safe? (dangerous only at 90,91,92) -> safe.\nt94: U -> y=9 at t95: done.\n\nBut wait, we must check freeways 7 and 8: we passed through freeway7 at t93? and freeway8 at t94? and at those times, they are safe.\n\nBut what about freeways 1 to 6? we passed through:\n  freeway1 at t87 -> safe (only dangerous at t86)\n  freeway2 at t88 -> safe\n  freeway3 at t89 -> safe\n  freeway4 at t90 -> safe\n  freeway5 at t91 -> safe\n  freeway6 at t92 -> safe\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nStart: t84: at y=0\nt84: U -> at t85: y=1\nt85: D -> at t86: y=0   (to avoid t86 on freeway1)\nThen at t86: at y=0\nt86: U -> at t87: y=1\nt87: U -> at t88: y=2\nt88: U -> at t89: y=3\nt89: U -> at t90: y=4\nt90: U -> at t91: y=5\nt91: U -> at t92: y=6\nt92: U -> at t93: y=7\nt93: U -> at t94: y=8\nt94: U -> at t95: y=9\n\nTotal actions: from t84 to t94: 11 actions? \n  Actions at: t84, t85, t86, t87, t88, t89, t90, t91, t92, t93, t94 -> 11 actions.\n\nBut we can count the steps: \n  We start at t84: y0=0.\n  After 1st action (t84): y=1 at t85.\n  After 2nd action (t85): y=0 at t86.\n  Then 3rd: y=1 at t87\n  4th: y=2 at t88\n  5th: y=3 at t89\n  6th: y=4 at t90\n  7th: y=5 at t91\n  8th: y=6 at t92\n  9th: y=7 at t93\n  10th: y=8 at t94\n  11th: y=9 at t95.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1 to 6 at t86. We could try to be above 6 by t86? \n\nBut we start at 0 at t84. In two moves: \n  t84: U -> y=1 at t85\n  t85: U -> y=2 at t86 -> but freeway2 at t86 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=0 for one turn? \n  At t84: S -> then at t85: y=0 -> then we can start at t85: U to y=1 at t86 -> but freeway1 at t86 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must not be on freeways 1-6 at t86.\n\nThe only safe freeways at t86 are 0,7,8,9? but we cannot get to 7 or 8 in two moves? \n  t84: U -> y1 at t85\n  t85: U -> y2 at t86 -> but we are at 2, which is dangerous.\n\n  We cannot jump to 7 in two moves.\n\nSo we must avoid freeways 1-6 at t86 by being at 0 at t86.\n\nBut then we have to start from 0 at t86.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to freeway7 or 8 at t86? but that requires 7 moves? \n  t84: U (y1 at t85)\n  t85: U (y2 at t86) -> but we are at 2 at t86 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the detour? \n\nBut wait, we could go up to freeway7 at a time that avoids t90-92? \n\nBut we are forced to be at freeway1 at some point. We must pass through each freeway.\n\nBut we can skip freeways? No, we move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: we can go down? but we start at 0, we cannot go below 0.\n\nSo the minimal path might be 11.\n\nBut note: we have another obstacle at freeways7 and 8 at t90-92. In the above plan, we are at freeway4 at t90, freeway5 at t91, freeway6 at t92, and then freeway7 at t93 (which is after 92) so safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? \n\nWe start at t84: y0=0.\n\nWe must be at y=0 at t86? because that's the only safe place at t86? \n\nAlternatively, we could be at y=7 or 8 at t86? but that would require 7 moves in two steps? impossible.\n\nOr y=9? 9 moves in two steps? impossible.\n\nSo we have to be at y=0 at t86.\n\nSo we have:\n\nOption A: \n  t84: U -> y1 at t85\n  t85: D -> y0 at t86\n\nOption B:\n  t84: S -> y0 at t85\n  t85: S -> y0 at t86   (but then we haven't made progress)\n\nBut we can do Option A and then we start at t86 at 0.\n\nThen we go up continuously until we get to 9.\n\nBut then we have to avoid freeways7 and 8 at t90-92.\n\nIn the above plan, we were at freeway4 at t90, freeway5 at t91, freeway6 at t92, and freeway7 at t93 (safe).\n\nBut what if we try to be faster? \n\nFrom t86: we are at 0.\n\nt86: U -> y1 at t87\nt87: U -> y2 at t88\nt88: U -> y3 at t89\nt89: U -> y4 at t90\nt90: U -> y5 at t91\nt91: U -> y6 at t92\nt92: U -> y7 at t93\nt93: U -> y8 at t94\nt94: U -> y9 at t95\n\nThat's 9 moves from t86 to t94, so 9 actions? But we start at t86 and take 9 actions: at t86,87,...,94 -> 9 actions, then we are at y9 at t95.\n\nBut we already used 2 actions (t84 and t85) to go up and down, so total 11.\n\nCan we avoid the freeways7 and 8 obstacle without waiting? \n\nNote: we are at freeway6 at t92. We then go to freeway7 at t93. But freeway7 is dangerous at t90,91,92. So at t93 it is safe.\n\nBut what if we want to get to freeway7 earlier? \n\nWe start from 0 at t86. We could go faster? We are moving one per turn. So we cannot get to freeway7 before t86+7 = t93? \n\nt86: y0\nt87: y1\nt88: y2\nt89: y3\nt90: y4\nt91: y5\nt92: y6\nt93: y7 -> freeway7 at t93: safe.\n\nBut we have to be at freeway7 at t93? and then freeway8 at t94, and freeway9 at t95.\n\nBut what if we try to skip freeway7 and go directly to 8? but we can only move one step at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we could slow down to avoid being at freeway7 or 8 at t90-92? \n\nBut we are at freeway4 at t90, freeway5 at t91, freeway6 at t92. We are not at freeway7 or 8 during t90-92.\n\nSo the above plan is safe.\n\nBut can we do it in 10 actions? \n\nWe need to get from 0 to 9 in 10 actions? that would put us at y9 at t84+10 = t94.\n\nBut we have to be at y0 at t86? so we have:\n\nt84: action -> to y1 at t85\nt85: action -> to y0 at t86\nthen we have 8 actions from t86 to t93 (inclusive) to get to y9 at t94? \n\nBut 8 actions: we can only move 8 steps? from 0 to 8? then at t94 we are at y8? then we need one more to go to y9 at t95.\n\nSo we need 11.\n\nWhat if we don't go down at t85? \n\nWe must avoid being on freeways1-6 at t86. \n\nIs there a way to be above 6 at t86? \n\nTo be at y7 at t86: we would need to go from y0 at t84 to y7 at t86: that's 7 moves in 2 steps: impossible.\n\nOr y6? 6 moves in 2 steps: impossible.\n\nSo we must be at y0 at t86.\n\nHence, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the detour by waiting at a freeway that is not dangerous? \n\nFor example, at t85 we are at y1. We can't stay because then at t86 we are at y1 (dangerous). We can't go up to y2 (dangerous at t86). We can only go down to 0.\n\nBut what if we go up to y1 at t85, and then at t85 we have an option? we must do something.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y1 at t85, and then at t85 we have no safe option other than down? \n\nBut wait, what if we go up to y1 at t85, then at t85 we do nothing? we are at y1 at t85. Then at t86 we must move. But at t86, if we are at y1, we are killed. So we must leave y1 by t86? but the only safe exit is down to 0.\n\nSo the above plan seems minimal.\n\nNow, what about the freeways7 and 8? In the above plan, we are at freeway7 at t93 and freeway8 at t94, which are safe.\n\nBut what if we try to get to freeway7 earlier? \n\nWe start at t86: y0.\n\nWe can do:\n\nt86: U -> y1 at t87\nt87: U -> y2 at t88\nt88: U -> y3 at t89\nt89: U -> y4 at t90\nt90: U -> y5 at t91\nt91: U -> y6 at t92\nt92: U -> y7 at t93 -> safe.\n\nBut if we try to get to y7 earlier? we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\nt86: U -> y1 at t87\nt87: U -> y2 at t88\nt88: U -> y3 at t89\nt89: U -> y4 at t90\nt90: S? -> then we stay at y4 at t91 -> safe? because freeway4 is only dangerous at t86? so safe.\nBut then we are wasting a move.\n\nSimilarly, we could wait at y6 at t92? but then we are at y6 at t92: safe? and then at t93 we go to y7, etc. That would take more moves.\n\nSo the continuous up is the fastest.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\n\nThis gets us to y=9 at turn 95.\n\nBut we have 11 actions? and the last action is at turn 94, and then we are at y9 at turn 95.\n\nThe problem asks for the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. Here t1=84, H=11, so actions from t84 to t84+10 = t94.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have actions for turns 84 to 94 (inclusive) -> 11 actions.\n\nBut let me write the y at each turn:\n\nt84: start at 0, then action U -> at t85: y=1\nt85: action D -> at t86: y=0\nt86: action U -> at t87: y=1\nt87: U -> t88: y=2\nt88: U -> t89: y=3\nt89: U -> t90: y=4\nt90: U -> t91: y=5\nt91: U -> t92: y=6\nt92: U -> t93: y=7\nt93: U -> t94: y=8\nt94: U -> t95: y=9\n\nYes, we reach y9 at t95.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 10? \n\nSuppose we don't go down at t85? we must avoid being at freeways1-6 at t86. \n\nWe could go up to y1 at t85, then at t85 we go up again? but then at t86 we are at y2 -> dangerous.\n\nWe could go up to y1 at t85, and then at t85 we stay? then at t86 we are at y1 -> dangerous.\n\nWe could go up to y1 at t85, and then at t85 we go down? to y0 at t86 -> safe.\n\nSo we have to do that.\n\nAlternatively, we could start by staying at t84: \n  t84: S -> at t85: y0\n  then at t85: U -> at t86: y1 -> dangerous.\n\nOr t85: S -> at t86: y0 -> then we start from t86 at 0. Then we take 9 moves to get to y9 at t95? but then total turns: from t84 to t95? that's 11 steps? and we did two stays? then we have 11 actions? same.\n\nBut if we start by staying at t84, then we are at t85 at y0. Then we have to go up from 0 at t85. Then we must avoid t86 on freeways1-6? so we cannot be on freeways1-6 at t86. We can go up to y1 at t86 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we must go down from y0? but we can't. So we have to be at 0 at t86? so we do:\n\nt84: S -> at t85: y0\nt85: S -> at t86: y0\n\nThen from t86: we go up 9 times: \n  t86: U -> y1 at t87\n  ... until\n  t94: U -> y9 at t95\n\nTotal actions: from t84 to t94: 11 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\n\nBut wait, at t90 we are at freeway4? and at t90, freeway4 is safe? yes, because the dangerous time for freeway4 is only t86.\n\nSimilarly, at t91: freeway5 -> safe, t92: freeway6 -> safe, t93: freeway7 -> safe (because dangerous times are 90,91,92), and t94: freeway8 -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut note: at t85 we are at freeway1? and at t85, freeway1 is safe? because dangerous only at t86? yes.\n\nAt t86 we are at freeway0 -> safe.\n\nAt t87: freeway1 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so we have t from 0 to 10? because H=11, so t=0,...,10. This corresponds to turns 84 to 94.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 84\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\n- **Dangerous times**:\n  - Freeways 1 to 6 are dangerous only at turn 86 (relative turn \\(t - 84 = 2\\)).\n  - Freeways 7 and 8 are dangerous at turns 90, 91, and 92 (relative turns 6, 7, 8).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed as follows:\n- **Turn 84 (start at \\(y=0\\))**: Move up to \\(y=1\\) at turn 85. Freeway 1 is safe at turn 85 (dangerous only at turn 86).\n- **Turn 85 (at \\(y=1\\))**: Move down to \\(y=0\\) at turn 86. This avoids being on freeways 1-6 at turn 86 (dangerous).\n- **Turn 86 (at \\(y=0\\))**: Move up to \\(y=1\\) at turn 87. Freeway 1 is safe at turn 87 (dangerous only at turn 86).\n- **Turns 87 to 94**: Continue moving up each turn to reach \\(y=9\\) at turn 95. The path through freeways 1-6 occurs at turns 87-92, which are safe (dangerous only at turn 86). Freeways 7 and 8 are encountered at turns 93 and 94, which are safe (dangerous only at turns 90-92).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\n```\n\nAfter the action at turn 94, the player reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 95. The total number of actions is \\(H = 11\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 84: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 85: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 86: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 87: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 88: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 90: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 91: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 92: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 86, and I start at y=0. The goal is to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction is given as \"right\" for all, which I think means they're moving to the right, so according to the update rule, for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], since for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I assume.\n\nLet me read the car update carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nFor right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd in the table, for freeway 1, it's (24, -11, right, 36). So head=24, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=36.\n\nSince it's right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-11, 24], I think. But tail is -11, head is 24, so if right-moving, τ should be the left end, h the right end? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end. So at t₁, the car occupies from x=τ to x=h.\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is at y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T), and we care about x=0.\n\nSo for freeway k, if y_T = k, and there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in its span at turn T, then collision.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and only after the action, you move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you might collide with cars on row y_T at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only need to worry about the current row y_T at turn T.\n\nSpecifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ span(T) but 0 ∉ span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for collision, it's only at the turn you are on that row. So at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you check for cars on row y_T at that time.\n\nIf you move vertically, at the next turn, you are on the new row.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t₁=86.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, since cars are only on y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, but y=9 is the goal, so we need to end there.\n\nThe grid is from y=0 to y=9, vertical axis, and cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are always safe.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at turn 86, and we need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably want to move up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the cars on the rows in between.\n\nSince we can only change y by one per turn, to go from 0 to 9, the minimum H is 9 turns, if we go up every turn. But we might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, which would increase H, so probably H >=9, and we want H=9 if possible, else more.\n\nBut with cars, it might not be possible in 9, so we need to check the car positions over time.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (24, -11, right, 36)  — only one car? The table says \"Cars\" but for freeway 1, it's listed as one tuple, similarly for 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nLook:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n1 | (24, -11, right, 36)\n\n2 | (24, -11, right, 36)\n\n3 | (24, -11, right, 36)\n\n4 | (0, -23, right, 24)\n\n5 | (0, -23, right, 24)\n\n6 | (0, -23, right, 24)\n\n7 | (56, 45, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4), (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\n8 | (56, 45, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4), (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nFor freeways 1 to 6, there is only one car each, with the same parameters for 1,2,3 and for 4,5,6.\n\nFor 7 and 8, three cars each.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, t₁ = 86 is the current turn.\n\nWe need to find the span at future turns relative to t₁.\n\nLet Δt = T - t₁, so at time T = t₁ + Δt, span for a car is as above.\n\nCollision at turn T if player is at y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nSince y_T is the row we're on at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn t₁=86, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action a_t determines Δy for that turn, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t₁ to t₁ + H -1, and after H turns, we have y_{t₁ + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t₁, we are at position for turn t₁, which is (0, y_{t₁}).\n\nThen we take action a_{t₁}, which affects y for turn t₁ +1.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to (0, y_{t+1}) at turn t+1.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, I think the index is a bit messy.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nWe start at t=86, y_{86} =0.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, we are at y_{86 + H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn 86 + H.\n\nAt turn 86 + H, y_{86+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from turn 86 to turn 86 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at turn 86, then at turn 87, y_87 = y_86 + Δy_86.\n\nIf we do U, y_87=1, but we need to be at y=9, so not yet.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, we need to have taken actions such that after T - 86 actions, we are at y_T=9.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nWe start at t=86, y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 86+k, we are at y_{86+k}.\n\nWe want y_{86+H} =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, H >=9.\n\nIf we go up every turn, H=9, we reach y=9 at turn 95.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn from t=87 to 95, when we are on rows y=1 to 8, whether at that turn, on that row, there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nIf not, we can go straight up.\n\nBut if at some point there is a collision risk, we might need to wait or go down.\n\nFirst, let's model the car positions over time.\n\nLet τ = T - t₁ = T - 86.\n\nAt time T, for a car, span(T) depends on τ.\n\nFor right-moving car with head h, tail τ (tail is tau, but I'll use t for turn, so let's use \"ta\" for tail to avoid confusion.\n\nIn the notation, tail is τ, but τ is also used for time, so I'll use \"tail\" for the car tail.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, at time t₁, it has head h, tail ta, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t₁) = [ta, h]\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [ta + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nCollision at turn T on row k if y_T = k and min(span) <= 0 <= max(span) for some car on row k.\n\nSince span is [left, right], 0 in [left, right] means left <= 0 <= right.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars and their span as function of τ = T - 86.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: h=24, ta=-11, d=right, s=36\n\nspan at T: left = ta + s τ = -11 + 36 τ\n\nright = h + s τ = 24 + 36 τ\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36τ <= 0 <= 24 + 36τ\n\nSince τ >=0, right is always positive, so 0 <= 24 + 36τ always true for τ>=0.\n\nLeft: -11 + 36τ <=0 when 36τ <=11, τ <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo 0 in span only if τ <= 11/36, which is less than 1, so for τ=0, T=86, left=-11, right=24, so -11<=0<=24, yes.\n\nBut at τ=0, T=86, we are at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision.\n\nFor τ=1, T=87, left = -11 +36 =25, right=24+36=60? s=36, τ=1, left= -11 +36*1 =25, right=24+36=60, so [25,60], 0 not in, since 25>0.\n\nSimilarly for τ>0.305, left >0, so 0 not in span for τ>=1.\n\nτ=0: T=86, span=[-11,24], 0 in, but we are not on row 1.\n\nτ=1: T=87, span=[25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for all τ>0, span starts at 25 and increases, so 0 never in for T>86.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at all turns T>=87, no car at x=0, so safe to be on row 1 at any time except possibly T=86, but we are not there.\n\nBut at T=86, we are on y=0, not 1.\n\nSo row 1 is always safe after start.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (24,-11,right,36), same thing, span at T: left=-11+36τ, right=24+36τ, 0 in only for τ=0, but T=86, we not on row 2. For T>86, not at 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, row 3 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nh=0, ta=-23, d=right, s=24\n\nspan(t₁) = [ta, h] = [-23, 0] for right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span(T) = [ta + s τ, h + s τ] = [-23 + 24 τ, 0 + 24 τ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +24τ <= 0 <= 24τ\n\nSince 24τ >=0 for τ>=0, 0<=24τ always true for τ>=0.\n\nLeft: -23 +24τ <=0 when 24τ <=23, τ <= 23/24 ≈ 0.958\n\nSo for τ=0, T=86, span=[-23,0], 0 in (since right end is 0).\n\nBut at T=86, we on y=0, not row 4.\n\nτ=1, T=87, span=[-23+24, 0+24] = [1,24], 0 not in, since left=1>0.\n\nSimilarly, for τ>0.958, left>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for row 4, at T=87 and later, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same car, (0,-23,right,24), same as above.\n\nFreeway 6: same, row 6 always safe after T=86.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, s=4.\n\nFirst car: h=56, ta=45, span(t₁)= [ta,h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T, span(T) = [45 + 4τ, 56 + 4τ]\n\nSince left=45+4τ >0 for all τ, and increasing, so 0 not in span ever. So this car never at x=0.\n\nSecond car: (20,9,right,4), so h=20, ta=9, span(t₁)= [9,20]\n\nAt T, [9 +4τ, 20+4τ], both >=9>0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nThird car: (-16,-27,right,4), h=-16? Head is -16, tail=-27.\n\nDirection right, so span(t₁) = [τ, h] but τ is tail, so [ta, h] = [-27, -16]? ta=-27, h=-16.\n\nSince right-moving, ta should be left, h right, but -27 < -16, so [ -27, -16 ] means from x=-27 to x=-16.\n\nAt T, span(T) = [ta + s τ, h + s τ] = [-27 + 4τ, -16 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -27 +4τ <= 0 <= -16 +4τ\n\nSince -16 +4τ <=0 when 4τ <=16, τ<=4\n\nAnd -27+4τ <=0 when 4τ<=27, τ<=6.75\n\nBut we need both inequalities.\n\n-27+4τ <=0 <= -16+4τ\n\nWhich means: -27+4τ <=0 and 0 <= -16+4τ\n\nSo from 0 <= -16+4τ, so 4τ >=16, τ>=4\n\nAnd from -27+4τ <=0, 4τ <=27, τ<=6.75\n\nAlso, since -16+4τ <=0 might not hold, but the inequality is 0 <= -16+4τ, which is τ>=4, and -27+4τ <=0 which is τ<=6.75\n\nNow, for 0 to be <= -16+4τ, that means -16+4τ >=0, so 4τ>=16, τ>=4\n\nAnd -27+4τ <=0, 4τ<=27, τ<=6.75\n\nThen for τ>=4 and τ<=6.75, 0 is in the span because left <=0 and right >=0? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=4, left= -27+16= -11, right= -16+16=0, so [-11,0], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\n0 <= 0 is true.\n\nAt τ=5, left= -27+20= -7, right= -16+20=4, so [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nSimilarly up to τ=6, left= -27+24= -3, right= -16+24=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=6.75, but τ integer since turns discrete.\n\nτ=6, T=86+6=92\n\nτ=7, left= -27+28=1, right= -16+28=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car, 0 in span for τ=4,5,6 i.e. T=90,91,92.\n\nτ=4, T=86+4=90\n\nτ=5, T=91\n\nτ=6, T=92\n\nT=90,91,92.\n\nNow, this car is on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nSame as above, so third car on row 8 has 0 in span at T=90,91,92.\n\nFirst two cars never at 0.\n\nNow, summarize for each row and time when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car at x=0.\n\nRow 1: never unsafe for T>=87, as we saw.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1, always safe.\n\nRow 3: same, always safe.\n\nRow 4: car at T=86 has 0, but we not there. For T>=87, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 5 and 6: same as row 4, safe for T>=87.\n\nNow row 7: unsafe when third car at x=0, which is at T=90,91,92.\n\nSimilarly row 8: unsafe at T=90,91,92.\n\nNow, rows 1 to 6 are always safe for T>=87.\n\nOnly rows 7 and 8 have unsafe times: T=90,91,92 for both.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 at t=86 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nWe can take actions to move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimum possible H is 9, reaching at t=95.\n\nBut we need to pass through rows 1 to 8.\n\nAt t=86, we are at y=0.\n\nWe take action at each turn starting from t=86.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nLet t be the turn, from 86 onwards.\n\nAt t=86, y=0.\n\nWe take action a_{86}, which sets y_{87}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T as small as possible.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are always safe, we can pass through them anytime without problem.\n\nThe only issue is rows 7 and 8, which are unsafe at t=90,91,92.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at turns 90,91,92.\n\nThat is, at t=90,91,92, we should not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nOtherwise, if we are on row 7 or 8 at those times, and since both rows have cars at x=0, we would collide.\n\nNow, for other times, rows 7 and 8 are safe.\n\nFor example, at t=89, what is row 7?\n\nt=89, τ= t - 86 =3\n\nFor row 7, third car: at τ=3, span=[ -27+4*3, -16+4*3] = [-27+12, -16+12] = [-15,-4], which is negative, so 0 not in, since -15<=0<=-4? 0 > -4? -4 <0, so 0 not in [-15,-4], since -4 <0.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 same.\n\nAt t=93, τ=7, span=[ -27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, before t=90 and after t=92, safe.\n\nSo rows 7 and 8 unsafe only at t=90,91,92.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is around t=90,91,92.\n\nWe should not be on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nNow, possible strategies:\n\nWe can go up directly, but if we go up every turn from t=86, we reach:\n\nt=86: y=0\n\na_{86}: U, then y_{87}=1\n\na_{87}: U, y_{88}=2\n\na_{88}: U, y_{89}=3\n\na_{89}: U, y_{90}=4\n\nBut at t=90, we are at y=4, which is row 4, safe, since row 4 is safe at t=90.\n\nt=90: y=4\n\na_{90}: U, y_{91}=5\n\nt=91: y=5, row 5, safe\n\na_{91}: U, y_{92}=6\n\nt=92: y=6, row 6, safe\n\na_{92}: U, y_{93}=7\n\nt=93: y=7, row 7. Now t=93, which is after 92, so row 7 is safe at t=93, as we saw.\n\na_{93}: U, y_{94}=8\n\nt=94: y=8, row 8. t=94, τ=94-86=8, span for row 8 third car: [-27+4*8, -16+32] = [-27+32, -16+32] = [5,16], 0 not in, safe.\n\na_{94}: U, y_{95}=9\n\nt=95: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, at which turns were we on row 7 or 8? At t=93 and t=94, both after t=92, so safe.

We checked all, only rows 7 and 8 at t=90,91,92.\n\nBut rows 1-6 are fine.\n\nIn the beginning, at t=86, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\nSo with all actions U, we can reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut let me list the actions:\n\nTurn t=86: a_{86} = U\n\nThen y_{87} = 0 +1 =1\n\nTurn t=87: a_{87} = U, y_{88} =1+1=2\n\nt=88: a_{88} = U, y_{89} =3\n\nt=89: a_{89} = U, y_{90} =4\n\nt=90: a_{90} = U, y_{91} =5\n\nt=91: a_{91} = U, y_{92} =6\n\nt=92: a_{92} = U, y_{93} =7\n\nt=93: a_{93} = U, y_{94} =8\n\nt=94: a_{94} = U, y_{95} =9\n\nNow at t=95, y=9, so we are done.\n\nH=9, actions from t=86 to t=94.\n\nt=86 to t=94 inclusive, that's 9 actions.\n\nAt turn t=94, after action, y_{95}=9.\n\nSo we reached at turn t=95.\n\nMinimal H=9.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars on row 4,5,6? Earlier we said they are safe after t=86.\n\nFor example, row 4 at t=90: τ=90-86=4, car: span=[ -23 +24*4, 0 +24*4]? Freeway 4 car: (0,-23,right,24)\n\nAt T, span=[ -23 +24τ, 0 +24τ]\n\nτ=4, T=90, span=[ -23+96, 0+96] = [73,96], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at t=86, for rows with cars at 0, but we not there.\n\nAnother thing: the player position at turn T is (0,y_T), and collision only if on that row at that turn.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach earlier? H=9 is minimum, since from 0 to 9, 9 steps up.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 0, so min H=9.\n\nAnd we achieved it.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere t_1=86, H=9, so from turn 86 to turn 94.\n\nt_1 + H-1 = 86 + 8 =94? H actions, from t=86 to t=86+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nSo actions at turns: 86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94.\n\n9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence: all U.\n\nBut let me write:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn 95.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nOne thing: at t=86, we are at y=0.\n\nAfter a_{86}=U, we move to y=1 at turn 87.\n\nAt turn 87, we are on row 1.\n\nIs row 1 safe at t=87?\n\nt=87, τ=1, freeway 1 car: span=[-11+36*1, 24+36*1]= [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all turns we are on rows 1-6 at times when they are safe, and rows 7 and 8 after t=92.\n\nSpecifically, we are on row 7 at t=93, which is safe.\n\nBut let me check row 7 at t=93.\n\nt=93, τ=7, row 7 third car: as above, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for row 8 at t=94: τ=8, span=[-27+32, -16+32]= [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier I thought rows 7 and 8 unsafe at t=90,91,92, but in our path, we are not there at those times.\n\nWe are on row 4 at t=90, row 5 at t=91, row 6 at t=92, all safe.\n\nThen row 7 at t=93, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a car on row 6 or something? Row 6 has car, but at t=92, y=6, row 6.\n\nFreeway 6 car: (0,-23,right,24)\n\nAt t=92, τ=92-86=6, span=[-23+24*6, 0+24*6]= [-23+144, 144]= [121,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with all up actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and we have it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we only care about the one that can be at 0.\n\nIn this case, for row 7, only the third car matters at certain times.\n\nBut in our path, we avoided those times.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to be on row 9 at turn 95, but row 9 has no cars, so fine.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, always safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=86.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn 95.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be up to turn t_1 + H-1 =86+8=94.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the answer format should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for t_1=86.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nBut in the action, it should be a_{t}, like U, D, S.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if we could reach faster, but we can't.\n\nOr if we stay, it would take more turns.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps for some rows we need to wait, but not necessary.\n\nAnother point: at turn t=86, we are at y=0, and we take action immediately.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: car (0,-23,right,24), at t=86, span=[-23,0], so x=0 is included, but we are not on row 4.\n\nAt t=87, span=[1,24], not at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 86\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Times\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3:** Each has one car with parameters (24, -11, right, 36). At any turn \\(T \\geq 87\\), the car span does not contain \\(x = 0\\), so these rows are safe for \\(T \\geq 87\\).\n- **Freeways 4, 5, 6:** Each has one car with parameters (0, -23, right, 24). At any turn \\(T \\geq 87\\), the car span does not contain \\(x = 0\\), so these rows are safe for \\(T \\geq 87\\).\n- **Freeway 7:** Has three cars. Only the third car \\((-16, -27, \\text{right}, 4)\\) can have \\(x = 0\\) in its span at turns \\(T = 90, 91, 92\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = T - 86 = 4, 5, 6\\)). Thus, row 7 is unsafe at \\(T = 90, 91, 92\\) but safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 8:** Has three cars identical to freeway 7. Only the third car can have \\(x = 0\\) in its span at turns \\(T = 90, 91, 92\\), so row 8 is unsafe at \\(T = 90, 91, 92\\) but safe otherwise.\n\nRows 0 and 9 have no cars and are always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in Minimal Turns\nThe minimal \\(H\\) to move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 9 turns, as each \"up\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1. A sequence of 9 consecutive \"up\" actions achieves this:\n- Start at turn 86: \\(y = 0\\).\n- After action at turn 86: \\(y_{87} = 1\\).\n- After action at turn 87: \\(y_{88} = 2\\).\n- ...\n- After action at turn 94: \\(y_{95} = 9\\).\n\nThis path avoids collisions:\n- At turns 90, 91, and 92, the player is on rows 4, 5, and 6, respectively, which are safe (no cars at \\(x = 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 87\\)).\n- The player is on row 7 at turn 93 and row 8 at turn 94, both after the unsafe period (90-92), so these are safe.\n- Rows 1-6 are safe at all relevant times.\n\nThus, \\(H = 9\\) is achievable and minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 86\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 94\\) is all \"U\" (up).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 86: U \\\\\nTurn 87: U \\\\\nTurn 88: U \\\\\nTurn 89: U \\\\\nTurn 90: U \\\\\nTurn 91: U \\\\\nTurn 92: U \\\\\nTurn 93: U \\\\\nTurn 94: U\n}",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: \n  U: y <- y+1 (if y<9)\n  D: y <- y-1 (if y>0)\n  S: stay\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: when moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, at that turn T the player is still on the old row (y) and only moves to the new row (y+1 or y-1) at the next state (turn T+1). So at turn T, we only check the car on the current freeway (the one we are leaving) and we don't check the freeway we are moving to until we are actually on it (at turn T+1).\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 88 to turn 88+H-1 that ends at y=9.\n\nWe note that the grid has freeways 1 to 8 (we are at y=2 initially, and we need to get to y=9). We cannot go beyond y=0 or y=9.\n\nCar movement:\n  For a car on a freeway, at turn t1 (current turn) we are given its head and tail and direction and speed.\n  Then at turn T (>= t1), the car's position is:\n    If left-moving (but note: the given direction is either \"left\" or \"right\", but in the problem the update is given for left-moving and right-moving. However, in the table, we see only \"right\" for all cars. So we assume all cars are right-moving? Actually, in the table for freeways 1-6, they are all right, and for 7 and 8 also right. So all cars are right-moving.\n\n  For a right-moving car: \n      At time t1: the car spans from tau to h (with tau < h, because it's right-moving and the head is at h, tail at tau, so h>tau). \n      Then at time T, the car is at [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  We are at x=0. Collision at turn T on freeway k occurs if 0 is in the interval [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nGiven that t1=88, then for a car with parameters (h, tau, d, s) at t1, at turn T (>=88) the car's span is:\n  [tau + s*(T-88), h + s*(T-88)]\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T when 0 is in the car span for any car on that freeway.\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn 88. We are on freeway 2 at turn 88? Actually, we are at (0,2) so we are on freeway 2? But note: the freeways are y=1,...,8. So at any turn, if our y is in {1,2,...,8}, we are on a freeway and must check for collisions.\n\nAt turn 88: we are at y=2. We must check freeway 2 at turn 88: are there any car on freeway 2 that has 0 in its span at T=88?\n\nFor freeway 2: car (-48,-83,right,36) -> but note: for right-moving, the head is the larger end? Actually, the problem states: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning tau is the tail and h is the head? But in the table, the car on freeway 2 is given as (-48, -83, right, 36). Since it's right-moving, the tail is at -83 and the head at -48? But -83 < -48, so that would imply the car goes from -83 to -48? But then at T=88, the car is at:\n  tail = -83 + 36*(88-88) = -83\n  head = -48 + 36*(0) = -48\n  So the span is [-83, -48]. Does 0 fall in this? No, because -83 to -48 is all negative.\n\nSo at turn 88, we are safe at y=2.\n\nNow, we must plan a sequence of actions to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe note that the minimal number of moves without any cars would be 7 moves (all U: from 2 to 9 in 7 steps). But we have cars that might block.\n\nWe must check for each freeway at each turn if we are going to be on that freeway at that turn and if at that turn the freeway has a car that covers x=0.\n\nWe can consider a BFS in the state space: state = (turn, y). The turn starts at 88 and we are at y=2. We can move to (89, y') where y' can be 1,2,3 (if we do D, S, U respectively). But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nHowever, the state space in time might be large because the cars move continuously? But note: the car positions are linear in time. And the critical points (when a car covers x=0) are periodic? Actually, we can precompute for each freeway the times at which x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nFor a car on freeway k with parameters (h, tau, d, s) (and d is right for all), we want to know the set of T (>=88) such that:\n  0 is in [tau + s*(T-88), h + s*(T-88)]\n\nSince the car is moving to the right, the interval at time T is [A, B] where A = tau + s*(T-88) and B = h + s*(T-88). We require A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSo:\n  tau + s*(T-88) <= 0   =>   T-88 <= -tau/s\n  h + s*(T-88) >= 0     =>   T-88 >= -h/s\n\nBut note: because the car is moving right, we have tau < h (at t1, the car is from tau to h, and h>tau). Also, the car might have length = h - tau.\n\nSo the condition is:\n  ceil((-h)/s) <= T-88 <= floor((-tau)/s)\n\nBut note: because the car moves continuously, the integer times T at which 0 is covered are the integers in the interval [ceil((-h)/s), floor((-tau)/s)]? Actually:\n\nWe have:\n  tau + s*(T-88) <= 0   => T-88 <= -tau/s   => T <= 88 - tau/s\n  h + s*(T-88) >= 0     => T-88 >= -h/s     => T >= 88 - h/s\n\nBut note: because the car moves to the right, as time increases the entire interval moves to the right. So the coverage at x=0 happens when the left end (which is tau + s*(T-88)) is <=0 and the right end (h+s*(T-88)) is >=0.\n\nSo the time interval (in terms of T-88) is:\n  t0_min = (-h)/s        -> the earliest time (relative) when the car just touches 0 with its head? Actually, when the head is at 0: h + s*(T-88)=0 -> T-88 = -h/s.\n  t0_max = (-tau)/s      -> when the tail leaves 0: tau + s*(T-88)=0 -> T-88 = -tau/s.\n\nBut note: the car covers 0 continuously from the moment the head reaches 0 until the tail leaves 0? Actually, when the head is at 0, the car is covering from (0) to (h - tau) to the right? But no: the head is the front. So when the head is at 0, the car covers from (0 - (h-tau)) to 0? \n\nWait, I think I have a confusion: in the problem, for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Yes. So the car at time T covers [tau + s*(T-88), h + s*(T-88)]. So the car covers 0 when the left endpoint (tau+s*(T-88)) is <=0 and the right endpoint (h+s*(T-88)) is >=0.\n\nTherefore, the condition is:\n  tau + s*(T-88) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-88)\n\nSolving:\n  T-88 >= (-h)/s   [from 0 <= h+s*(T-88) => T-88 >= -h/s]\n  T-88 <= (-tau)/s [from tau+s*(T-88)<=0 => T-88 <= -tau/s]\n\nBut note: since the car is moving right, h>tau, so -h/s < -tau/s (because h>tau and s>0). So the interval for T-88 is [ (-h)/s, (-tau)/s ].\n\nBut T-88 must be an integer? Actually, T is integer, so T-88 is integer. So we are looking for integers k = T-88 in the interval [ceil((-h)/s), floor((-tau)/s)]? \n\nWait: the inequalities are:\n  k >= (-h)/s   -> k >= ceil((-h)/s) ? Actually, k must be at least the smallest integer >= (-h)/s? But note: if (-h)/s is not integer, then k must be at least ceil((-h)/s). Similarly, k must be at most the largest integer <= (-tau)/s? \n\nBut let me check with an example: \n  Suppose at T=88, car: h=10, tau=-10, s=10. Then the car at T=88 is at [ -10, 10]. So at T=88, k=0: \n      (-h)/s = -10/10 = -1 -> so k>=-1 -> which is true for k=0.\n      (-tau)/s = 10/10=1 -> k<=1 -> true.\n\nBut we require k in [-1,1]? Then k=0 and k=1? But at k=0: [ -10+0, 10+0] = [-10,10] -> 0 is covered -> correct.\n      k=1: [ -10+10, 10+10] = [0,20] -> 0 is covered -> correct.\n      k=2: [10,30] -> 0 not covered.\n\nBut actually, at k=1: the car has moved so that the tail is at 0? So the car is [0,20] -> so 0 is included? Yes.\n\nBut note: the problem says the car at T is [tau + s*k, h+s*k]. So at k=0: [-10,10] -> 0 is inside. At k=1: [0,20] -> 0 is inside. At k=2: [10,30] -> 0 not inside.\n\nSo for the example, the car covers 0 at k=0 and k=1.\n\nBut our inequalities: \n  k >= ceil((-h)/s) = ceil(-10/10)=ceil(-1)= -1\n  k <= floor((-tau)/s)= floor(10/10)=floor(1)=1\n\nSo k in [-1,1] -> but k=T-88>=0? Actually, we are starting at k=0. So k=0 and k=1.\n\nTherefore, for each car, the set of k (>=0) such that the car covers 0 at turn 88+k is:\n   k_min = ceil( (-h) / s )   [but if negative, then we take max(0, ...) ? but note k>=0] \n   k_max = floor( (-tau) / s )\n\nAnd then k in [k_min, k_max] if k_min<=k_max.\n\nBut note: if (-h)/s is negative, then k_min = ceil(negative) might be negative -> then we take k_min=0? Because k>=0.\n\nActually, k must be at least 0. So the set is:\n   k_min = max(0, ceil( (-h) / s ) )\n   k_max = floor( (-tau) / s )\n\nand if k_min <= k_max, then the car blocks freeway k at every k in [k_min, k_max].\n\nBut note: (-h)/s and (-tau)/s might be fractional.\n\nWe can compute for each freeway the union of the blocking intervals from all cars on that freeway.\n\nLet's do that for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: car (-48,-83,right,36)\n   k_min = max(0, ceil( (48)/36 )) = ceil(48/36)=ceil(1.333)=2\n   k_max = floor(83/36)=floor(2.305)=2\n   So k in [2,2] -> only at k=2 (i.e., turn 88+2=90)\n\nFreeway 2: same car -> same as freeway1: blocked only at k=2 (turn 90)\n\nFreeway 3: same -> blocked at k=2 (turn 90)\n\nFreeway 4: car (48,25,right,24) -> note: head=48, tail=25 -> but wait, for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than tail? 48>25 -> so that's fine.\n   k_min = max(0, ceil(-48/24)) = ceil(-2)= -2 -> so 0\n   k_max = floor(-25/24) = floor(-1.041) = -2 -> wait, negative? Then no nonnegative k? \n\nBut let me check: at k=0: \n   tail = 25 + 24*0 = 25\n   head = 48 + 24*0 = 48\n   so the car is at [25,48] -> 0 not covered.\n\nAt any k>=0: the car moves right, so the entire car is to the right of 0. So never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, freeway4 is never blocked.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4 -> never blocked.\n\nFreeway6: same -> never blocked.\n\nFreeway7: three cars: \n   car1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> wait, head=-48, tail=-59? But for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost. Here -48 > -59, so head=-48, tail=-59 -> the car is from -59 to -48? Then at k=0: [-59, -48] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n   Compute for car1:\n        k_min = max(0, ceil(48/4)) = ceil(12)=12\n        k_max = floor(59/4)=floor(14.75)=14\n        So k in [12,14] -> turns 100,101,102 (relative k=12,13,14)\n\n   car2: (28,17,right,4) -> head=28, tail=17 -> at k=0: [17,28] -> doesn't cover 0.\n        k_min = max(0, ceil(-28/4)) = ceil(-7)= -7 -> 0\n        k_max = floor(-17/4)=floor(-4.25)= -5 -> no nonnegative k? \n        Actually: k_min=0, k_max=-5 -> then the interval is empty? So no blocking.\n\n        But let me check: we require:\n           17 + 4*k <= 0 <= 28+4*k -> \n           For the first inequality: 17+4k<=0 -> k<=-4.25 -> impossible for k>=0.\n        So no blocking.\n\n   car3: (-8,-19,right,4) -> head=-8, tail=-19 -> so the car is from -19 to -8. At k=0: [-19,-8] -> doesn't cover 0.\n        k_min = max(0, ceil(8/4))=ceil(2)=2\n        k_max = floor(19/4)=floor(4.75)=4\n        So k in [2,4] -> turns 90,91,92 (k=2,3,4)\n\nTherefore, freeway7 is blocked at:\n   car1: k in [12,14] -> turns 100,101,102\n   car3: k in [2,4] -> turns 90,91,92\n\nSo freeway7 is blocked at k=2,3,4,12,13,14.\n\nFreeway8: same cars as freeway7 -> same blocking times: k=2,3,4,12,13,14.\n\nSummary of blocked times per freeway (for k>=0, k = turns after 88):\n\nFreeway 1: k=2\nFreeway 2: k=2\nFreeway 3: k=2\nFreeway 4: never\nFreeway 5: never\nFreeway 6: never\nFreeway 7: k in {2,3,4,12,13,14}\nFreeway 8: k in {2,3,4,12,13,14}\n\nNow, we are at turn 88 (k=0) at y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can only move one unit per turn (or stay). We cannot be on a freeway at a time when that freeway is blocked.\n\nWe can use BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1) over states (k, y) for k=0,1,2,... and y in [0,9]. We start at (0,2). Goal: any state with y=9.\n\nAt state (k, y), we can choose an action: U, D, S.\n\nThe next state will be (k+1, y') where:\n  if U: y' = min(y+1,9) -> but if y==9, then U does nothing? But the problem: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and if we are at 9 and do U, we remain at 9? Similarly for D at 0.\n\nBut note: the update: \n   U: if at y, then next y = y+1 if y<9, else 9? But the problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then clipped to [0,9]? Actually, the problem states: y_{t+1} in [0,9] and the update is as given. So if y_t=9 and we do U, then y_{t+1}=min(9+1,9)=9? Similarly for D at 0.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\" so it's clipped.\n\nSo the update: \n   U: y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t+1)\n   D: y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t-1)\n   S: y_{t+1}=y_t\n\nBut note: when moving, we are subject to collision only on the freeway we are on at the current turn? \n\nSpecifically, at turn T (which is 88+k), we are at y. Then we choose an action. The action changes our y at the next turn (T+1). But at the current turn T, we are on the current freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and we must not be blocked at T.\n\nSo the collision check: at state (k,y) (which is at turn 88+k) we must check if y is in {1,...,8} and if k is in the blocked set for freeway y? Then we cannot be here.\n\nTherefore, the state (k,y) is valid only if either y is 0 or 9 (which are safe) or y in [1,8] and at time k the freeway y is not blocked.\n\nWe start at (0,2): \n   k=0, y=2 -> freeway2: at k=0, is freeway2 blocked? From above: freeway2 blocked only at k=2 -> so at k=0: safe.\n\nThen we can move to next states.\n\nWe are to find the minimal k such that we can be at (k,9) and the entire path is valid.\n\nWe note that we must avoid:\n\n- At k=2: \n   freeways 1,2,3: blocked -> so if at k=2 we are on freeway1,2, or 3, we crash.\n   freeways 7,8: also blocked at k=2 -> so if at k=2 we are on freeway7 or 8, crash.\n\nBut note: we start at y=2 (freeway2) at k=0.\n\nWe can try to move up as fast as possible, but we must avoid being on freeways 1-3 and 7-8 at k=2.\n\nOne idea: at k=0 (turn88): we are at y=2. We must not be on freeway2 at k=2? But we are at k=0, we can move.\n\nWe have to get to y=9. The minimal steps is 7 (if we go up every step). But we must avoid the blocked times.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nOption 1: go straight up (all U) from k=0 to k=6:\n\nk=0: y=2 -> safe (freeway2: not blocked at k=0)\nk=1: we do U: then we are at y=3 at k=1. \n   Check: at k=1, freeway3: blocked only at k=2 -> safe.\nk=2: we do U: then we are at y=4 at k=2. \n   Check: freeway4: never blocked -> safe.\nk=3: U -> y=5: safe (freeway5: never blocked)\nk=4: U -> y=6: safe (freeway6: never blocked)\nk=5: U -> y=7: freeway7: at k=4? -> k=4 is blocked for freeway7? Yes! k=4 is in {2,3,4,12,13,14} -> blocked.\n\nSo at k=5: we are at y=7? Actually, no: \n   at k=4: we were at y=6 (freeway6) and we do U -> then at k=5 we are at y=7. \n   But the collision check at k=5: we are at freeway7 at time k=5. \n   Is freeway7 blocked at k=5? Our set for freeway7: k in {2,3,4,12,13,14} -> k=5 is not blocked. \n   So safe? \n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nk0: turn88: y=2 -> safe.\n   action: U -> then at turn89: k1: y=3.\nk1: at turn89 (k1: k=1): we are at y=3 -> freeway3: blocked only at k=2 -> safe.\n   action: U -> at turn90: k2: y=4.\nk2: turn90 (k=2): y=4 -> freeway4: never blocked -> safe.\n   action: U -> at turn91: k3: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n   action: U -> at turn92: k4: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n   action: U -> at turn93: k5: y=7 -> freeway7: at k=5? Our set for freeway7: {2,3,4,12,13,14} -> k=5 is not in there -> safe.\n   action: U -> at turn94: k6: y=8 -> freeway8: at k=6? blocked set: {2,3,4,12,13,14} -> k=6 not there -> safe.\n   action: U -> at turn95: k7: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo that would take 7 moves? But we started at k0 (turn88) and we did 7 moves: \n   turn88: U -> then we have moves at turn88,89,90,91,92,93,94: that's 7 moves, and at turn95 we are at y=9? \n   Actually, we start at turn88: we are at (88,2). \n   After first action (at turn88): we move at the end of turn88 to y=3? Then at turn89 we are at y=3.\n   Then at turn89: we do U -> at turn90: y=4.\n   ... \n   at turn94: we do U -> at turn95: y=9.\n\nSo total turns: from turn88 to turn95: 8 turns? But we did 7 actions: from turn88 to turn94 (inclusive) -> 7 actions, and we are at turn95 at y=9.\n\nBut the goal: we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if we start at turn88 and do 7 actions (H=7) then the last action is at turn88+6? and we are at turn88+7-1 = turn94? But at turn94 we are at y=8? Then we haven't reached 9.\n\nWait, the problem: \n   We are to find H and a sequence of actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\n   After H actions, we are at turn t1+H? But the state after H actions is at turn t1+H. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we do actions at turns: t1 (t=0), t1+1 (t=1), ... t1+H-1 (t=H-1). Then the last state update is at turn t1+H-1 to state at turn t1+H? \n\n   But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"?\n\n   Let me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n   So the position at turn t1+H-1 must be (0,9). \n\n   How does the update work? \n      At turn t, we do action a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n   So at turn t1+H-1, we do the last action, and then we update to y_{t1+H} = ...? But the position at turn t1+H-1 is (0, y_{t1+H-1}) and we want that to be (0,9)? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n   So we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? Or at the end of the turn?\n\n   Let me see the dynamics: \n        At turn t: we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t. Then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n   So at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. After the action, we are at y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\n   Therefore, we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n   So at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we don't need to do an action? But the sequence of actions goes up to turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: we do actions from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions). Then the position at turn t1+H-1 is the result after the last action? \n\n   But note: the update: \n        turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=2. Then we do action a_{t1} -> then we become y_{t1+1} at the next turn.\n        ...\n        at turn t1+H-1: we do action a_{t1+H-1} -> then we become y_{t1+H}.\n\n   So to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have already been at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1 and then we do an action (maybe S) to remain at 9? Or we could have gotten to 9 at the update at the end of turn t1+H-2? \n\n   Actually, the position at the start of turn t is y_t. Then we do action a_t, and then we become y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\n   Therefore, we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. That means that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we don't necessarily need to do an action at that turn? But the sequence requires an action for that turn. We can do S.\n\n   Alternatively, we might have reached 9 at the update from turn t1+H-2: so that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we do S (or any action, but we are at 9 so U and S will keep us at 9, D would drop to 8) -> so we must do S or U to remain at 9.\n\n   But the problem: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So at the start of that turn we are at 9? Then we do an action? and then we become y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n   However, the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). Then we do an action at that turn? But the action might move us? \n\n   But note: the collision condition: at turn t, we are at y_t and we check the freeway for that turn. Then we do an action and move to y_{t+1}. \n\n   So if we are at y_t=9 at turn t (start of turn), then we are at y=9 which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8) so no collision. Then we do an action (say S) and we remain at 9 for the next state.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: we must be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we do an action at that turn (which doesn't matter for the goal, but we have to output one) and then the state for the next turn is set.\n\n   So the minimal H: the number of actions, which is the number of turns we act: from t1 to t1+H-1 -> H actions. Then the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is the result of the previous actions? \n\n   Actually, the state at the start of turn t1 is given: y=2.\n   After H actions, we have acted at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1 -> so we have H actions. Then the state at the start of turn t1+H is the result of the last action? But we care about the state at the start of turn t1+H-1? \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n   This means: we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\n   How do we get to the state at turn t1+H-1? \n        The state at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\n   Specifically:\n        At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=2 (given).\n        We do a_{t1}: then we are at y_{t1+1} at the start of turn t1+1.\n        ...\n        At turn t1+H-2: we are at y_{t1+H-2}. We do a_{t1+H-2} -> then we are at y_{t1+H-1} at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\n   Therefore, we require that after the action at turn t1+H-2, we get to y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n   Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we must do an action (the last one, a_{t1+H-1})? But we are already at 9 at the start of that turn. The problem requires an action for that turn. \n\n   So the minimal H: we need to do actions until the turn at which we are at 9 at the start? And then we do one more action? \n\n   But wait: if we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we do an action at that turn (which is the H-th action, since we did H-1 actions already?).\n\n   Actually, the actions: \n        t1: action0 -> then at turn t1+1: we are at y1\n        t1+1: action1 -> then at turn t1+2: y2\n        ...\n        t1+H-1: action_{H-1} -> then at turn t1+H: y_H\n\n   But we want at turn t1+H-1: we are at 9. That is, the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is 9. How did we get that state? \n        It is the result of the action at turn t1+H-2: \n              y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Delta a_{t1+H-2}\n\n   So we require that after H-1 actions, we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1? Then we do an extra action (the H-th action) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of actions is the minimal number of moves to get from 2 to 9 (which is 7) and then we do an extra action at the goal? So H=8? \n\n   But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for H actions? \n\n   Alternatively, we might be able to be at 9 at the start of turn t1+7 (if we did 7 moves) and then we don't need an extra action? \n\n   But the sequence must cover until the turn at which we are at 9. \n\n   The problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n   If we do 7 actions: \n        turn88: action0 -> then at turn89: y=?\n        ...\n        turn94: action6 -> then at turn95: y=?\n\n        We want at turn94 (which is t1+6) to be at 9? But then H-1 = 6 -> H=7? \n\n        So the last action is at turn94 (which is t1+6, so t=6) and then at the start of turn94 we are at 9? \n\n        But how do we get to 9 at the start of turn94? \n            At turn93: we are at some y. Then we do action at turn93 (which is the 6th action) and then we update to y at turn94.\n\n        So we require that the update at the end of turn93 (from action at turn93) sets y at turn94 to 9.\n\n        Then at the start of turn94 we are at 9. And then we do the 7th action at turn94? \n\n        But the sequence has H=7 actions: from turn88 to turn94.\n\n        Then the state at turn t1+H-1 = 88+7-1 = 94 is (0,9). \n\n        So that matches.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 7 if we can get to 9 at the start of turn94 (by doing 7 actions: from turn88 to turn94). \n\n   But note: we start at turn88 at y=2. \n        After 1 action (turn88): we get to y=3 at turn89.\n        After 2 actions: y=4 at turn90.\n        ...\n        After 7 actions: we get to y=9 at turn95? \n\n   That doesn't match: we want to be at 9 at turn94.\n\n   Actually, we start at turn88: y=2.\n        We do an action at turn88: then at turn89 we are at y3 = 2 + (if U) 1 = 3.\n        Then at turn89: we do U: then at turn90: y=4.\n        ...\n        At turn93: we do U: then at turn94: y = 8+1 = 9.\n\n        So at the start of turn94, we are at y=9.\n\n        And we have done 6 actions? \n            Actions: turn88,89,90,91,92,93 -> 6 actions -> H=6? \n\n        Then the last action is at turn93 (t1+5) and then at turn94 (t1+6) we are at 9. \n        But the problem requires the position at turn t1+H-1 = turn88+6-1 = turn93 to be (0,9)? \n            At turn93: we are at y=8? \n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n   Let me define:\n        Let t0 = t1 = 88.\n        At the start of turn t0, we are at y0=2.\n        We do action a0 at turn t0 -> then at the start of turn t0+1, we are at y1 = y0 + Delta(a0).\n\n        Similarly, at the start of turn t0+k, we are at y_k.\n\n        Then we require that at the start of turn t0 + (H-1), we are at 9.\n\n        And we have done actions at turns: t0, t0+1, ... t0+H-2? \n\n        Because the last action that affects the state at t0+H-1 is the action at turn t0+H-2.\n\n        Then at turn t0+H-1, we do an action (a_{H-1})? but that action affects the state at turn t0+H, not at t0+H-1.\n\n        But the problem requires an action for turn t0+H-1? \n\n        So we have:\n            Action at turn t0: a0 -> state at t0+1: y1\n            ...\n            Action at turn t0+H-1: a_{H-1} -> state at t0+H: y_H\n\n        And we require that the state at turn t0+H-1 is 9.\n\n        How is the state at turn t0+H-1 determined? \n            It is determined by the action at turn t0+H-2: \n                  y_{t0+H-1} = y_{t0+H-2} + Delta(a_{t0+H-2])\n\n        Then at turn t0+H-1, we are at 9, and then we do an action a_{H-1} (which might change it, but we don't care as long as at the start of that turn we are at 9).\n\n        So the minimal number of actions to get to 9 is the minimal number of steps to go from 2 to 9 (which is 7 steps) and then we do an extra action at the turn when we are already at 9? \n\n        But that would be H=8: \n            Actions at turns: 88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95? \n            Then we require at turn88+8-1 = 95 to be at 9? \n\n        How do we get there? \n            We do 7 moves (U) from turn88 to turn94: \n                turn88: U -> at turn89: 3\n                turn89: U -> at turn90: 4\n                turn90: U -> at turn91: 5\n                turn91: U -> at turn92: 6\n                turn92: U -> at turn93: 7\n                turn93: U -> at turn94: 8\n                turn94: U -> at turn95: 9\n\n            Then at turn95 (which is t1+7) we are at 9. But we require at turn95 (which is t1+7) to be at 9, and then we do an action at turn95? \n\n            But our last action in the sequence would be at turn94? and then we are at 9 at turn95. But the problem requires the sequence to go up to turn t1+H-1 = 88+8-1=95? \n\n            Then we must do an action at turn95. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do 7 actions and be at 9 at turn95? Then the state at turn95 (which is t1+7) is 9, and then we do an action at turn95? \n\n        But then H=7? and we require at turn t1+7-1=94 to be at 9? -> no, at turn94 we are at 8.\n\n        Or if we do 6 actions: \n            turn88: U -> turn89:3\n            turn89: U -> turn90:4\n            turn90: U -> turn91:5\n            turn91: U -> turn92:6\n            turn92: U -> turn93:7\n            turn93: U -> turn94:8\n            then at turn94: we are at 8, not 9.\n\n        We need 7 upward moves to go from 2 to 9. \n\n        Therefore, the earliest we can be at 9 is at turn88+7 = turn95.\n\n        And we want that to be the start of turn95? then we require at turn95 to be at 9, and then we do an action at turn95.\n\n        So H=8: actions at turns88 to95 (8 actions), and then at the start of turn95 we are at 9? \n\n        But how do we get to 9 at the start of turn95? \n            We must have been at 8 at the start of turn94, then done U at turn94 to get to 9 at turn95.\n\n        So the state at the start of turn95 is 9. And then we do an action at turn95 (which is the 8th action).\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\n        And the sequence will have 8 actions.\n\n        We then require that the state at the start of turn88+8-1 = turn95 is 9? -> turn95 is the last turn of the sequence? \n\n        But the start of turn95 is before we do the action at turn95. \n\n        So yes, at the start of turn95 we are at 9.\n\n        And then we do an action at turn95 (which is included in the sequence).\n\n        Therefore, H=8.\n\n        But note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn95 (the start), and then we do an action.\n\n        So the minimal number of actions is 8.\n\n        However, we might be able to get to 9 earlier? \n\n        We start at turn88 at y=2.\n        The earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn88+7 = turn95? as above.\n\n        So minimal H=8.\n\n        Now, we must avoid collisions at every turn from turn88 to turn94 (the turns we are on freeways) and also at turn95 we are at y=9 (safe) so no collision check.\n\n        In our earlier simulation of 7 moves (which would get us to y=8 at turn94) and then one more move (U) at turn94 to get to y=9 at turn95) -> then we have 8 moves.\n\n        But we must check the entire path:\n\n          turn88: y=2 -> freeway2: blocked at k=0? no -> safe. Action: U -> then at turn89: y=3.\n          turn89: y=3 -> freeway3: blocked at k=1? no (only k=2) -> safe. Action: U -> turn90: y=4.\n          turn90: y=4 -> freeway4: never blocked -> safe. Action: U -> turn91: y=5.\n          turn91: y=5 -> freeway5: never blocked -> safe. Action: U -> turn92: y=6.\n          turn92: y=6 -> freeway6: never blocked -> safe. Action: U -> turn93: y=7.\n          turn93: y=7 -> freeway7: at k=5? (k = turn - 88 = 93-88=5) -> not in {2,3,4,12,13,14} -> safe. Action: U -> turn94: y=8.\n          turn94: y=8 -> freeway8: at k=6? not in blocked set -> safe. Action: U -> turn95: y=9.\n\n        So the sequence for H=8: \n             turn88: U\n             turn89: U\n             turn90: U\n             turn91: U\n             turn92: U\n             turn93: U\n             turn94: U\n             turn95: U   -> but then at turn95 we are at 9, and we do U again? But we are at 9, so U leaves us at 9.\n\n        But the problem: we only need to be at 9 at the start of turn95. Then we can do any action? However, we must output an action for turn95. We can do S or U.\n\n        But we don't need to move further. We can do S at turn95.\n\n        However, the sequence must be minimal. But we have to output an action for every turn from 88 to 95.\n\n        So we can do 7 U's and then at the last turn (95) do S? \n\n        But the actions for turns88 to94 are U, and then turn95: S.\n\n        Then the state at the start of turn95 is 9, and we do S -> state at turn96: 9.\n\n        But the problem only requires to be at 9 at turn95.\n\n        So both are acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says minimal number of turns H. We have H=8.\n\n        But is there a faster way? \n\n        We start at 2 and need to get to 9: 7 moves up. And we have to do 7 moves to increase by 7. So we cannot do it in fewer than 7 moves. And then we have to have an action at the turn when we are at 9? \n\n        So minimal H is 8.\n\n        However, note that we might be able to get to 9 earlier by a different route? For example, if we go down to 0 and then up? That would take more moves. \n\n        Or if we wait sometimes to avoid the blocked times.\n\n        But in our current path we don't hit any blocked freeway. \n\n        But what about the blocked freeways at k=2? \n            At turn90: k=2 -> we are at y=4 (freeway4) -> safe.\n            But what if we were at freeway2 at turn90? then we would crash.\n\n        In our path, at turn90 (k=2) we are at y=4 -> safe.\n\n        However, what if we had moved slower? we started at y=2 at turn88. \n          Option: \n             turn88: S -> then at turn89: still at y=2.\n             turn89: then we do U: at turn90: y=3 -> freeway3 at k=2: blocked! -> crash.\n\n          So we cannot stay at turn88.\n\n          We must move up.\n\n        But what if we move down? \n             turn88: D -> y=1 at turn89.\n             turn89: y=1 -> freeway1 at k=1: safe (freeway1 blocked only at k=2)\n             turn90: at y=1, k=2: freeway1 is blocked! -> crash.\n\n        So we must not be at freeway1,2,3 at k=2.\n\n        Our plan of moving up quickly to y=4 by k=2 (turn90) is safe.\n\n        And then we avoid freeway7 and 8 at k=2,3,4? \n            We are at y=7 at turn93 (k=5) and y=8 at turn94 (k=6) -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, the plan: \n            turn88: U\n            turn89: U\n            turn90: U\n            turn91: U\n            turn92: U\n            turn93: U\n            turn94: U\n            turn95: S   (or U, but S is fine)\n\n        But wait: at turn94: we are at y=8. Then we do U to get to 9 at turn95. Then at turn95 we are at 9 and we do S to stay.\n\n        But the action at turn95: we can do U? then we stay at 9. Or S: also stay.\n\n        So both are acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says minimal H: we have H=8.\n\n        But note: we might be able to get to 9 earlier by a different path? \n\n        We are at y=2 at turn88.\n        We need to get to 9. The minimal moves is 7 upward moves. And they must be done in 7 consecutive moves? Not necessarily: we might go up and then down and then up? but that would take more moves.\n\n        So minimal number of moves is 7, and then one extra action at the goal turn -> 8 actions.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n        Turn 88: U\n        Turn 89: U\n        Turn 90: U\n        Turn 91: U\n        Turn 92: U\n        Turn 93: U\n        Turn 94: U\n        Turn 95: S\n\n        But note: the last action is at turn95, which is t1+7. Then H=8, so the last turn index is t1+H-1 = 88+7 = 95? \n\n        Actually, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: \n            t=0: turn88\n            t=1: turn89\n            ...\n            t=7: turn95\n\n        So the last action is at turn95.\n\n        We must be at (0,9) at turn95 (the start of turn95). How did we get there? \n            At turn94: we were at y=8. Then we did U at turn94 -> then at turn95: y=9.\n\n        So at the start of turn95, we are at 9.\n\n        Then we do S at turn95 -> then at turn96: y=9.\n\n        That satisfies.\n\n        However, is there a way with H=7? \n            We would do actions at turns88,89,90,91,92,93,94 -> 7 actions.\n            We require that at turn88+7-1 = turn94, we are at 9.\n\n            How to get to 9 at turn94? \n                We start at turn88: y=2.\n                Then we need to go from 2 to 9 in 6 moves? because the last move (at turn93) would update to turn94.\n\n                The net upward moves must be +7. But we have 6 moves: the sum of Delta y must be 7. \n                Each move: +1, -1, or 0. \n                Maximum we can go up in 6 moves is 6. \n\n            So impossible.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H=8.\n\n        But note: what if we use D moves to avoid some blocks? \n            For example, at turn88: we do U -> turn89:3.\n            turn89: we do D? then turn90:2 -> but at turn90 (k=2) we are at freeway2: blocked -> crash.\n\n            Or turn88: U -> turn89:3.\n            turn89: S? then turn90:3 -> freeway3 at k=2: blocked -> crash.\n\n            So we must be at y>=4 at turn90 (k=2).\n\n            How? \n                turn88: U -> 3\n                turn89: U -> 4: then at turn90: we are at 4 -> safe.\n\n            Then we have 5 moves left (from turn90 to turn94) to go from 4 to 9: that requires 5 moves: U five times -> then at turn95:9. But then we are at 9 at turn95, which is after the 7th action (at turn94). \n\n            Then we would need an 8th action at turn95? \n\n            So the same.\n\n        Therefore, the only safe and minimal way is to go up continuously and then do an extra action at the end.\n\n        But we have to avoid freeway7 and 8 at k=2,3,4? \n            In our plan, we are at:\n               turn88: k0: y2 -> safe.\n               turn89: k1: y3 -> safe.\n               turn90: k2: y4 -> safe.\n               turn91: k3: y5 -> safe.\n               turn92: k4: y6 -> safe.\n               turn93: k5: y7 -> freeway7: k5 not blocked -> safe.\n               turn94: k6: y8 -> freeway8: k6 not blocked -> safe.\n               turn95: k7: y9 -> safe.\n\n        So the entire path is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Turn 88: U\n        Turn 89: U\n        Turn 90: U\n        Turn 91: U\n        Turn 92: U\n        Turn 93: U\n        Turn 94: U\n        Turn 95: S   (or U, but S is also safe and we don't need to move)\n\n        However, note that at turn95 we are at y=9, and then we do S: that is safe.\n\n        But the problem doesn't require to minimize the actions beyond H, so either is fine.\n\n        We'll output S for the last action.\n\n        But let me check if we can do without the last action? \n\n        The problem: we must output a sequence of H actions. And we found that H=8 is minimal.\n\n        So we output 8 actions.\n\n        However, note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn95. And we are there at the start of turn95. Then we do an action (S) at turn95. \n\n        The problem does not say that we must remain at 9 after the last action? It only requires to be there at that turn.\n\n        So it's acceptable.\n\n        But what if we do nothing after reaching? The sequence must have H actions.

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. I need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), that moves the player vertically from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe player moves on the y-axis only, and collisions happen only if the player is on a freeway y=k (for k=1 to 8) at a turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you're not on the new freeway until the next turn. So, if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you are on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. Similarly for down or stay.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if y_T = k (freeway row), and for that k, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe car spans move according to their speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase. But in the car state, all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check the car states.\n\nFor freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36) — head 24, tail -11, direction right, speed 36.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t₁), h + s(t - t₁)], because for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t₁, so at T, it's [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nt₁ = 90 is the current turn.\n\nI need to find actions from t=90 onwards, for t=90, 91, 92, ..., up to when y=9.\n\nMinimal H, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\ny from 4 to 9, difference is 5, so minimum moves would be 5 ups, but might not be possible due to cars.\n\nOr fewer if we can move multiple steps, but each action changes y by at most 1, so to go from 4 to 9, we need at least 5 up actions, since y increases by 1 per U, and S or D would add turns without progress, so H at least 5.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 5.\n\nFirst, let's list all the car positions over time relative to t₁.\n\nSet τ = T - t₁, so at time T = t₁ + τ, the span for a car.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when 0 is in the car span, meaning the car is covering position x=0 at that time.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, as position is (0, y), so we care about when x=0 is occupied by a car on the row y at time T.\n\nCollision if at turn T, y_T = k, and for freeway k, there is a car such that 0 ∈ span at T.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at turn t₁.\n\nSince all are right-moving, I'll use the span update.\n\nFor right-moving car: at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but no left-moving here.\n\nIn the table, all directions are \"right\", so all cars are right-moving.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nNow, 0 ∈ span at T means that τ + s(T - t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t₁) for a right-moving car.\n\nSince for right-moving, the tail is smaller, head is larger, so span is [tail, head], so 0 ∈ [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] if τ + s(T - t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t₁)\n\nSimilarly for left, but not applicable.\n\nSo, for each car, I can find the times T when this inequality holds.\n\nThen, for each freeway, at times when any car on that freeway has 0 in span, it is occupied, so player cannot be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at t=90.\n\ny=4 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so player can be there safely.\n\nBut goal is (0,9), so y=9 is safe.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4? Freeways y=1 to 8 correspond to rows, I think.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, y=2 freeway 2, ..., y=8 freeway 8.\n\nPlayer at (0,4) at t=90, so on freeway 4.\n\nNow, I need to check if at t=90, freeway 4 is occupied.\n\nFirst, for freeway 4, the car is (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nAt T = t₁ = 90, T - t₁ = 0\n\nSpan: τ + s*0 = -71 + 0 = -71? τ is tail, which is -71.\n\nGeneral: for right-moving, at T, position: tail_T = τ + s(T - t₁)\n\nhead_T = h + s(T - t₁)\n\nSo at T=90, T - t₁ =0, so tail = τ = -71, head = h = -48? No.\n\nThe car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 4: (head, tail) = (-48, -71)? That can't be right.\n\nLook: \"(-48, -71, right, 24)\"\n\nBut if head is -48 and tail is -71, since it's right-moving, tail should be less than head, -71 < -48, so tail is -71, head is -48.\n\nAt T=90, span: [ -71 + s*0, -48 + s*0] = [-71, -48]\n\n0 is not in [-71, -48] because -71 to -48, 0 is greater, so no, 0 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut let's systematically find for each freeway when it is occupied.\n\nFirst, for a car, 0 ∈ [τ + s(τ), h + s(τ)] for τ = T - t₁\n\nSince s(τ) = s * τ, let δ = T - t₁, time offset.\n\nSo for right-moving car: τ + s δ ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δ\n\nWhere τ is tail, h is head at δ=0.\n\nIn the notation, the car state gives (h, τ, d, s), with h and τ at t₁.\n\nSo for each car, we have inequality:\n\nτ + s δ ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δ\n\nWhich means:\n\nτ + s δ ≤ 0  and 0 ≤ h + s δ\n\nSo s δ ≤ -τ and s δ ≥ -h\n\nFrom τ + s δ ≤ 0: s δ ≤ -τ\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s δ: s δ ≥ -h\n\nSo -h ≤ s δ ≤ -τ\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nThen δ must satisfy: ceil( -h / s ) ≤ δ ≤ floor( -τ / s ) ? Let's see.\n\ns δ ≥ -h ⇒ δ ≥ ceil( -h / s ) ? Since δ integer, time is discrete.\n\nδ = T - t₁, integer.\n\ns δ ≥ -h ⇒ δ ≥ ceil( -h / s )\n\nSimilarly, s δ ≤ -τ ⇒ δ ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nBecause s δ ≤ -τ, and s δ integer if s integer, but s may not integer? Speed is integer, I think.\n\nAll speeds are integers: 36, 24, 4, etc.\n\ns integer, δ integer, so s δ integer.\n\n- h and -τ may not integer, but positions are integers? Head and tail are positions, I assume integers.\n\nIn the car state, head and tail are given as integers, like 24, -11, etc.\n\nSo all integers.\n\nSo s δ ≥ -h ⇒ δ ≥ ceil( -h / s )\n\nSince s δ must be at least -h, so δ ≥ ceil( -h / s )\n\nSimilarly, s δ ≤ -τ ⇒ δ ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nBecause s δ must be <= -τ.\n\nThen 0 in span when δ satisfies:\n\nδ_min = ceil( (-h) / s )   and δ_max = floor( (-τ) / s ) ? Let's define.\n\nSet A = ceil( (-h) / s )\n\nB = floor( (-τ) / s )\n\nThen δ must satisfy A <= δ <= B for 0 to be in span? Not necessarily.\n\nFrom above:\n\ns δ >= -h  => δ >= ceil( -h / s )\n\ns δ <= -τ  => δ <= floor( -τ / s )\n\nAnd since the span is inclusive, 0 in [tail_T, head_T] when tail_T <= 0 <= head_T.\n\nNow, for each car, we can find the range of δ where this holds.\n\nSimilarly for multiple cars on a freeway, the freeway is occupied if any car has 0 in span at that δ.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, (h, τ, d, s) = (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nSo tail at δ=0: τ = -11, head = 24\n\nThen 0 in span when:\n\ns δ >= -h = -24\n\ns δ <= -τ = -(-11) = 11? -τ\n\nτ = -11, so -τ = -(-11) = 11\n\nh = 24, -h = -24\n\ns = 36\n\nSo s δ >= -h => 36 δ >= -24 => δ >= ceil(-24/36) = ceil(-2/3) = ceil(-0.666) = -1? ceil(-0.666) is -0, but since negative, ceil to higher integer? Ceil function.\n\nceil(x) is smallest integer >= x.\n\n-24/36 = -2/3 ≈ -0.666, ceil(-0.666) = 0? No, ceil(-0.666): -0.666, smallest integer >= -0.666 is 0? No, 0 is greater than -0.666, but -1 is less than -0.666, so ceil(-0.666) should be 0? Let's think.\n\nExamples: ceil(-0.666) = 0 because 0 >= -0.666 and it's integer.\n\nBut -1 < -0.666, so not >=.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-1.5) = -1, because -1 >= -1.5.\n\nGeneral: for negative, ceil(x) is towards zero? No.\n\nceil(-0.666) = 0\n\nBut let's compute numerically.\n\n-24/36 = -0.666, ceil(-0.666) = 0 because 0 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -0.666.\n\nSimilarly, floor(-0.666) = -1.\n\nBut in inequality:\n\ns δ >= -h = -24\n\n36 δ >= -24\n\nDivide both sides by 36: δ >= -24/36 = -2/3\n\nSince δ integer, δ >= ceil(-2/3) = ceil(-0.666) = 0\n\nBecause δ must be at least the smallest integer >= -2/3, which is 0.\n\nSimilarly, s δ <= -τ = -(-11) = 11\n\n36 δ <= 11\n\nδ <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so δ <= floor(0.305) = 0\n\nSince δ <= 0.305, δ integer, so δ <= 0\n\nNow, from above: δ >= 0 and δ <= 0, so δ = 0\n\nAt δ=0, check: tail_T = τ + s δ = -11 + 36*0 = -11\n\nhead_T = 24 + 0 = 24\n\n0 in [-11,24]? Yes, -11 <= 0 <= 24.\n\nFor other δ, if δ=1, tail_T = -11 +36=25, head_T=24+36=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nδ=-1, tail_T = -11 +36*(-1) = -11-36= -47, head_T=24-36=-12, [-47,-12], 0 not in, since -12 <0.\n\nSo indeed, only at δ=0 for this car.\n\nBut δ=0 is t₁, current turn.\n\nNow for freeway 1, only one car, so occupied only at δ=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car? \"2 | (24, -11, right, 36)\" same as freeway 1? No, each freeway has its own cars.\n\nFreeway 2 has identical car: (24, -11, right, 36), so same, occupied only at δ=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (24, -11, right, 36), same, occupied only at δ=0.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nh = -48, τ = -71, s=24\n\n- h = -(-48) = 48? s δ >= -h\n\n- h = - (h) = -(-48) = 48\n\ns δ >= -h => 24 δ >= 48? Let's see.\n\ns δ >= -h = -(-48) = 48? -h: h is -48, so -h = -(-48) = 48\n\ns δ >= -h => 24 δ >= 48\n\nδ >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSimilarly, s δ <= -τ = -(-71) = 71\n\n24 δ <= 71\n\nδ <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so δ <= floor(2.958) = 2\n\nNow, δ >=2 and δ <=2, so δ=2\n\nAt δ=2, tail_T = τ + s δ = -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23\n\nhead_T = -48 + 24*2 = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-23, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, (-48, -71, right, 24), so occupied at δ=2.\n\nFreeway 6: same, occupied at δ=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars: (-40, -51, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nAll with speed 4.\n\nFirst car: (h, τ) = (-40, -51), s=4\n\n- h = -(-40) = 40\n\ns δ >= -h => 4 δ >= 40 => δ >= 10\n\ns δ <= -τ = -(-51) = 51 => 4 δ <= 51 => δ <= 12.75, so δ <= 12\n\nThus δ from 10 to 12 inclusive.\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 4)\n\nh=36, τ=25\n\n- h = -36\n\ns δ >= -h => 4 δ >= -36? -h = -36\n\ns δ >= -h => 4 δ >= -36 => δ >= -9\n\nBut δ >=0? Time, δ = T - t₁, can be negative, but we care about future turns, I think for planning, from now on, δ >=0.\n\nSimilarly, s δ <= -τ = -25 => 4 δ <= -25 => δ <= -6.25, so δ <= -7? floor.\n\n4 δ <= -25 => δ <= -25/4 = -6.25, so δ <= -7? Since δ integer, δ <= -6.25, so δ <= -7? No.\n\nδ <= floor(-6.25) = -7? floor(-6.25) is -7, since -7 < -6.25 < -6, floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so -7.\n\nBut let's see inequality: 4 δ <= -25\n\nIf δ = -6, 4*(-6) = -24 > -25? -24 > -25, so -24 <= -25? No, -24 > -25, so 4 δ = -24 > -25, so not <= -25.\n\nThus 4 δ <= -25 requires δ <= -7, since 4*(-7) = -28 <= -25.\n\nSimilarly, δ >= ceil(-36/4) = ceil(-9) = -9\n\nBut for δ <= -7 and δ >= -9, but δ negative, for future turns δ>=0, so for second car, at δ>=0, s δ >= -h = -36, which is true for all δ>=0 since -36 negative, 4δ >=0 > -36? 4δ >=0 for δ>=0, which is >= -36, so s δ >= -h always true for δ>=0.\n\ns δ <= -τ = -25, 4δ <= -25, which for δ>=0, 4δ >=0 > -25? -25 is negative, 4δ >=0 for δ>=0, which is greater than -25, so 4δ <= -25 is false for all δ>=0.\n\nThus for second car, no δ>=0 where 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, third car on freeway 7: (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nh=0, τ=-11\n\n- h = -0 =0\n\ns δ >= -h => 4 δ >= 0 => δ >=0\n\ns δ <= -τ = -(-11) =11 => 4 δ <=11 => δ <= 2.75, so δ <=2\n\nThus δ from 0 to 2 inclusive.\n\nNow for freeway 7, occupied if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: δ=10,11,12\n\nSecond car: no for δ>=0\n\nThird car: δ=0,1,2\n\nSo overall for freeway 7, occupied at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same cars, (-40,-51,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)\n\nSo same as freeway 7, occupied at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\nNow, also freeway 1,2,3 occupied only at δ=0\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 occupied at δ=2\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0, which freeways are occupied?\n\ny=1: occupied\n\ny=2: occupied\n\ny=3: occupied\n\ny=4: freeway 4, at δ=0, not occupied, as we saw earlier, only at δ=2.\n\nFor y=4, car at δ=2, not δ=0.\n\ny=5: similarly, freeway 5, same as 4, occupied at δ=2\n\ny=6: same, δ=2\n\ny=7: occupied at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\ny=8: same, δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\nAt δ=0 (current turn), occupied freeways: 1,2,3,7,8\n\ny=4,5,6 not occupied at δ=0.\n\nPlayer is at y=4 at δ=0, which is not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y: U: y+1, D: y-1, S: y same.\n\ny must be in 0 to 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=4, min 5 U actions.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSince moving, when we take an action at turn T, we are at y_T, and we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAt turn T, we are on freeway y_T, so we need y_T not occupied at time T.\n\nThen after action, at T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nFor example, at T= t₁ =90, y=4, not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, we can choose action for turn 90.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y becomes 5 at t=91.\n\nIf D, y=3 at t=91.\n\nIf S, y=4 at t=91.\n\nBut at t=91, δ=1.\n\nNow, at δ=1, which freeways occupied?\n\nFreeway 1: only δ=0, so not occupied at δ=1.\n\nSimilarly, 2,3 not occupied.\n\nFreeway 4: only δ=2, not δ=1.\n\n5,6 similar.\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at δ=1 (since 0,1,2)\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 occupied at δ=1.\n\nSo at δ=1, occupied: y=7 and y=8.\n\nOthers not occupied.\n\nSimilarly at δ=2: freeway 1,2,3 not occupied (only δ=0)\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 occupied (δ=2)\n\nFreeway 7,8 occupied (δ=2)\n\nSo at δ=2, occupied: y=4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=4,5,6 because of their cars, y=7,8 because of their cars.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 safe, and we can reach in min 5 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut we need to avoid occupied rows at the right time.\n\nLet me list the occupied times for each row:\n\ny=1: occupied only at δ=0\n\ny=2: only δ=0\n\ny=3: only δ=0\n\ny=4: occupied at δ=2\n\ny=5: occupied at δ=2\n\ny=6: occupied at δ=2\n\ny=7: occupied at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\ny=8: occupied at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\nFor y=7 and 8, occupied at δ=0,1,2 and 10,11,12, but since we are planning for small H, probably δ=10+ is far, we might reach before, so ignore for now.\n\nSimilarly, other times not occupied.\n\nNow, player at y=4, δ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 with some sequence.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nPossible to go up directly.\n\nAt δ=0, y=4 safe.\n\nIf we go U at turn 90, to y=5 at δ=1.\n\nAt δ=1, y=5: is it occupied? y=5 freeway, at δ=1, not occupied, since only occupied at δ=2 for y=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 not occupied at δ=1.\n\nSo at turn 91 (δ=1), y=5 safe.\n\nThen from y=5, we can go U to y=6 at turn 92 (δ=2).\n\nAt δ=2, y=6: occupied? y=6 occupied at δ=2, yes.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at δ=2, it is occupied, collision.\n\nCannot be on y=6 at δ=2.\n\nIf we go S or D at turn 91, but we are at y=5 at turn 91.\n\nTurn 91: at y=5, δ=1.\n\nAction: if U, go to y=6 at turn 92, δ=2, but y=6 occupied at δ=2, collision.\n\nIf D, go to y=4 at turn 92, δ=2.\n\nAt δ=2, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf S, stay at y=5 at turn 92, δ=2.\n\nAt δ=2, y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nSo all actions from y=5 at turn 91 lead to collision at turn 92 if we are still on freeway.\n\nBut we need to move to avoid.\n\nPerhaps at turn 90, don't go up immediately.\n\nMaybe go down first or something.\n\ny=0 is safe, we can go to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is below, might take more turns.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are occupied at early δ, but we can delay.\n\nAnother idea: since at δ=0,1,2 y=7 and 8 are occupied, we need to be on y=7 or 8 only when not occupied, which is after δ=2 or before, but before δ=0 not possible.\n\nAfter δ=2, until δ=10.\n\nBut δ=3 to 9, y=7 and 8 are not occupied, since only occupied at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nFor example, y=4,5,6 only occupied at δ=2, so at other times safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8 or go directly.\n\nBut y=6 to y=7, etc.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are blocked at δ=0,1,2, we need to reach them after δ=2.\n\nSimilarly, at δ=2, y=4,5,6 are occupied, so we cannot be on them at δ=2.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=4,5,6 at δ=2, and avoid being on y=7,8 at δ=0,1,2.\n\nNow, current: at δ=0, y=4.\n\nSince y=4 is not occupied at δ=0, we can stay or move.\n\nBut if we stay at y=4 at turn 90 (δ=0), then at turn 91, we are still at y=4? Action at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nTurn-based: at turn T, we are at position y_T, then we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if we are on freeway y_T and it is occupied at time T.\n\nSo at turn T, time T, position y_T.\n\nFor example, turn 90 (δ=0), y=4, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_90: if S, then at turn 91 (δ=1), y=4 still.\n\nAt δ=1, y=4: is it occupied? y=4 only occupied at δ=2, not δ=1, so safe.\n\nIf a_90 U, at turn 91 y=5.\n\nIf a_90 D, at turn 91 y=3.\n\nNow, at turn 91 (δ=1), if y=4, not occupied, safe.\n\nIf y=5, not occupied (only δ=2), safe.\n\nIf y=3, at δ=1, y=3 not occupied (only δ=0), so safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to turn 92 (δ=2).\n\nAt δ=2, y=4,5,6 occupied, y=7,8 occupied, so we cannot be on any of y=4,5,6,7,8 at δ=2.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,9 are safe at δ=2.\n\ny=1,2,3 at δ=2: not occupied, since only at δ=0.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at turn 92 (δ=2), we must be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9.\n\nBut we are coming from below or above.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nSince at δ=2, we cannot be on y=4 to 8, we must be on y<=3 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is far, we are at y=4 at δ=0, so in two turns, we can reach at most y=6 or y=2, etc., not y=9.\n\nAt turn 90, δ=0, y=4.\n\nAfter one action, turn 91, δ=1, y could be 3,4,5.\n\nThen after another action, turn 92, δ=2, y could be from y_{91} + {-1,0,1}, so if y=3, can be 2,3,4; y=4: 3,4,5; y=5:4,5,6.\n\nBut at turn 92, δ=2, we need y not in {4,5,6,7,8}, so y must be 0,1,2,3 or 9.\n\nFrom the possible y at turn 92, it can be 2,3,4 if from y=3; 3,4,5 from y=4; 4,5,6 from y=5.\n\nNone of these include y=0,1, or 9, only up to y=6 or down to y=2.\n\ny=2,3 are possible, since they are safe at δ=2.\n\nFor example, if at turn 91 we are at y=3, then at turn 92 we can be at y=2 (if D), or y=3 (S), or y=4 (U).\n\nBut y=4 at δ=2 occupied, so only y=2 or y=3 possible at turn 92.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 91 y=4, then at turn 92 can be y=3,4,5; only y=3 safe, y=4 and5 occupied.\n\nIf at turn 91 y=5, at turn 92 y=4,5,6 all occupied.\n\nSo to be safe at turn 92, we must be at y<=3 at turn 91.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If at turn 91 y=3, then we can go to y=2 or y=3 at turn 92.\n\n- If at turn 91 y=4, only can go to y=3 at turn 92 (since y=4 and5 occupied).\n\n- If at turn 91 y=5, cannot go anywhere safe at turn 92, all options occupied.\n\nTherefore, at turn 91 (δ=1), we must not be at y=5, because from there, no safe action for turn 92.\n\nIf at y=5 turn 91, action U to y=6 at turn 92: y=6 occupied at δ=2.\n\nD to y=4: occupied.\n\nS to y=5: occupied.\n\nAll collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=4 turn 91, only D to y=3 is safe, S to y=4 or U to y=5 both lead to occupied at turn 92.\n\nIf at y=3 turn 91, D to y=2 or S to y=3 both safe, U to y=4 occupied.\n\nNow, at turn 90, we start at y=4.\n\nAction a_90:\n\nIf U: to y=5 at turn 91.\n\nBut at turn 91 y=5, which is dead end, cannot avoid collision at turn 92.\n\nIf D: to y=3 at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 91 y=3, we can choose D to y=2 or S to y=3 at turn 92, both safe.\n\nIf S: to y=4 at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 91 y=4, we must go D to y=3 at turn 92 to avoid.\n\nNow, after turn 92, δ=2 is past, we can move up.\n\nδ=3 and beyond, the only occupied times are for y=7 and 8 at δ=10,11,12, which is later, we can reach y=9 before that.\n\nδ=10 is 10 turns from now, we can reach y=9 in less than 10 turns probably.\n\nFor example, from y=2 or y=3 at δ=2, we can start moving up.\n\ny=7 and 8 are free after δ=2 until δ=10.\n\nSimilarly other rows.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nFirst, from turn 90: if we go down, to y=3 at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 91, we can go down to y=2 or stay at y=3 at turn 92.\n\nEither way, at turn 92, we are at y=2 or y=3.\n\nThen from there, we can go up repeatedly to y=9.\n\nSince no obstacles until y=7 and 8 at δ=10, but δ=10 is turn 100, we can reach y=9 by turn 95 or so.\n\nFor example, at turn 92 (δ=2), y=2 or 3.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9.\n\nDifference: from y=2 to y=9 is 7, so min 7 U actions, but we can do it.\n\nSimilarly from y=3, min 6 U actions.\n\nBut we might be able to go up faster from other paths.\n\nAnother option: at turn 90, go S to y=4 at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 91, go D to y=3 at turn 92.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nBut if we go S at turn 90, we stay at y=4 for one extra turn, which might not be necessary.\n\nIn terms of turns, going down might be faster to avoid.\n\nSince at δ=2 we need to be low, but we start at y=4.\n\nIf at turn 90, we go D to y=3 at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 91, we can go S to y=3 or D to y=2 at turn 92.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nThen at turn 92, say we are at y=2 or y=3.\n\nNow, we can start going up.\n\nFor example, at turn 92, δ=2, y=3.\n\nThen action U to y=4 at turn 93 (δ=3).\n\nAt δ=3, which freeways occupied? Only y=7 and 8 at later times, so y=4 not occupied at δ=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6 not occupied except at δ=2, past.\n\ny=7 and 8 occupied only at δ=10,11,12, so for δ=3 to 9, not occupied.\n\nSo at turn 93, y=4 safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at turn 94 (δ=4), safe.\n\nU to y=6 at turn 95 (δ=5), safe.\n\nU to y=7 at turn 96 (δ=6), now y=7 at δ=6, not occupied (since occupied only δ=0,1,2,10,11,12), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=8 at turn 97 (δ=7), safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn 98 (δ=8), and y=9 safe, reached.\n\nH = number of actions from t=90 to t=98, which is 9 turns? Turns: t=90 to t=98, actions at t=90 to t=97? Let's index.\n\nStart at turn t=90, position given.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at t+1.\n\nSo sequence of actions from t=90 to t=90 + H -1, and position at t=90 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t=90 + H.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=90.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_90), at t=91.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=90 + k.\n\nWe want at time t=90 + k, y=9.\n\nAnd k = H, minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=90 to t=90 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, with T = t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, before action, position (0, y_{t_1}).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at t_1 +1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, position at (t_1 + H-1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9)? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, position at (t_1 + H-1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut it says reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"the sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so actions for turns: t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1 + t} at turn t_1 + t, the position is updated to y_{t_1 + t + 1}.\n\nSo after all actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1 is the time when we take the last action or before?\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, then we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nThat is, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1 + H-1}, but since we are at y=9, and action might move, but we don't care after reaching, as long as at that turn we are at (0,9).\n\nAfter reaching, we stop, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, for H turns, we have actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and position at t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}, after action a_{t_1}, position at t_1 +1, ..., after action a_{t_1 + H-2}, position at t_1 + H-1, then we take action a_{t_1 + H-1}, which sets position at t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, before taking action, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we can take any action, but since we reached, it should be fine.\n\nIn the action sequence, we specify actions up to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and position at t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had at turn 92 (t=92, δ=2) at y=3, for example.\n\nt_1=90, so turn 90: δ=0\n\nTurn 91: δ=1\n\nTurn 92: δ=2\n\nThen at turn 92, we want to be at some y.\n\nIn the plan: from turn 90, go D to y=3 at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 91, go S to y=3 at turn 92 (or D to y=2).\n\nAt turn 92, y=3 (or 2), safe since δ=2 and y=3 not occupied.\n\nThen at turn 92, we can go U to y=4 at turn 93 (δ=3)\n\nAt turn 93, y=4, not occupied (only δ=2 for y=4), so safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at turn 94 (δ=4), safe.\n\nU to y=6 at turn 95 (δ=5), safe.\n\nU to y=7 at turn 96 (δ=6), safe.\n\nU to y=8 at turn 97 (δ=7), safe.\n\nU to y=9 at turn 98 (δ=8).\n\nAt turn 98, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, turn 98 is t_1 + 8, since t_1=90, 90+8=98.\n\nH is the number of turns? t_1 + H -1 =98, so 90 + H -1 =98, thus H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=90 to t=98? t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =98, t_1=90, so 90 + H -1 =98, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions: a_90 to a_98? a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{90} to a_{98}? t_1 + H -1 =90 +9 -1=98, so actions at turn 90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98? That's 9 actions.\n\nBut after a_98, position at turn 99, but we want position at turn 98 to be 9.\n\nAt turn 98, before action, position should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above: at turn 98, we are at y=9, after action a_97 which was U from y=8 at turn 97 to y=9 at turn 98.\n\nThen at turn 98, we are at y=9, so we can take a_98, but since we are already at goal, a_98 can be anything, but to stop, perhaps S or something, but in the sequence, we need to specify actions up to H-1.\n\nIn this case, for H=9, actions from t=90 to t=98, but a_98 is at turn 98, and at that turn we are already at y=9, so taking a_98 might move us, but since we reach at turn 98, it should be fine, and we can set a_98=S to stay, but actually, the position at turn 98 is before action, so we are at (0,9) at turn 98, then we take action, but for reaching, it's ok.\n\nTo avoid moving away, we can set last action to S if needed, but in this case, since we reach at turn 98, and action a_98 is taken, but position after might not be 9 if we move, but the condition is to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is turn 98, before action.\n\nSo position at turn 98 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, after a_97, position at turn 98 is 9.\n\nThen a_98 can be specified, but it doesn't affect reaching.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nIn the above, we used 8 actions? Let's list turns:\n\nTurn 90: start y=4\n\nAction a_90: D, so at turn 91, y=3\n\nAction a_91: S (or D, but let's say S), so at turn 92, y=3\n\nAction a_92: U, so at turn 93, y=4\n\nAction a_93: U, turn 94, y=5\n\nAction a_94: U, turn 95, y=6\n\nAction a_95: U, turn 96, y=7\n\nAction a_96: U, turn 97, y=8\n\nAction a_97: U, turn 98, y=9\n\nNow, at turn 98, y=9, reached.\n\nActions taken: a_90 to a_97, that's 8 actions: t=90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97.\n\nH=8, since actions from t=90 to t=97, which is t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =97, t_1=90, so 90 + H -1 =97, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nAnd position at turn t_1 + H -1 =97? Turn 97: at turn 97, y=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nAfter a_97 at turn 97, position at turn 98 is y=9.\n\nBut turn 98 is t_1 + 8, since 90+8=98.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =98 for H=9.\n\nSet H such that t_1 + H -1 =98.\n\nt_1=90, so 90 + H -1 =98, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions: from t=90 to t=98? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =90 to 98, 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, with actions up to a_97, we have position at turn 98 is 9, but a_97 is at turn 97.\n\nTo have position at turn T=98 be 9, we need to have arrived by turn 98.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from t=90 to t=97 would set position at turn 98 to 9, with a_97 U from y=8 at turn 97 to y=9 at turn 98.\n\nThen at turn 98, we are at y=9, so for the sequence, we need to include a_98, but since we are already there, a_98 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence for H=9, actions a_90 to a_98.\n\na_90 to a_97: 8 actions to reach y=9 at turn 98.\n\nThen a_98: S to stay at y=9, but position at turn 98 is before a_98, so we are at y=9, then a_98 S, position at turn 99 y=9, but we don't care.\n\nTo reach at turn t_1 + H -1, with H=9, turn 98.\n\nWith the actions: a_90 D, a_91 S, a_92 U, a_93 U, a_94 U, a_95 U, a_96 U, a_97 U, a_98 S\n\nBut after a_97 U, at turn 98 y=9, then a_98 S, at turn 99 y=9, but position at turn 98 is 9, good.\n\nBut we have an extra action at the end.\n\nWe can reach faster.\n\nIn the sequence, a_97 U brings us to y=9 at turn 98, so for H=8, actions from t=90 to t=97, position at t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +7? t_1=90, t_1 + H -1 =90 + H -1.\n\nSet this to 98, so 90 + H -1 =98, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nIf we reach at turn 98, H must be 9.\n\nBut turn 98 is t_1 + 8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 + 8, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nPosition at turn t is after actions up to t-1? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is determined before action a_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo to have y_T = 9 at some turn T.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we can reach at turn 97, then T=97, t_1 + H -1=97, 90 + H -1=97, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, at turn 97, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at an earlier turn if possible.\n\nBut with the constraints, at turn 92 we are at y=3, then it takes 5 ups to go to y=8 at turn 97, then to y=9 at turn 98.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps: y3 to y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9, 6 actions.\n\nAt turn 92, we are at y=3 (after actions at turn 90 and 91).\n\nThen actions a_92 U to y4 at turn93, a_93 U to y5 at94, a_94 U to y6 at95, a_95 U to y7 at96, a_96 U to y8 at97, a_97 U to y9 at98.\n\nSo at turn98, y=9.\n\nTo reach at turn97, we need y=9 at turn97.\n\nBut from above, at turn97 y=8.\n\nIf we can be higher earlier.\n\nBut at turn92, we are forced to be low.\n\nAt turn90, if we go S to y4 at turn91.\n\nThen at turn91, go D to y3 at turn92.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nAt turn90, go D to y3 at turn91.\n\nThen at turn91, instead of S, go D to y2 at turn92.\n\nThen at turn92 y=2.\n\nThen need to go up to y9, 7 steps: a_92 U to y3 at93, a_93 U to y4 at94, ..., up to a_98 U to y9 at99, then at turn99 y=9, which is later, turn t_1 +9=99, so H=10, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=3 at turn92.\n\nThen from there, min to y9 is 6 actions: from turn92 to turn97 for actions, position at turn98 y=9.\n\nBut turn98 is t_1 +8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =98, H=9.\n\nCan we reach faster by not going down?\n\nFor example, at turn90, go S to y4 at turn91.\n\nAt turn91, y=4, δ=1, not occupied.\n\nThen at turn91, we must go D to y3 at turn92, because if U or S, to y5 or y4 at turn92, both occupied at δ=2.\n\nSo only D to y3 at turn92.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAt turn90, go U to y5 at turn91.\n\nBut at turn91 y=5, then at turn92, whatever we do, y=4,5,6 all occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo only way is to go down to y=3 at some point.\n\nBut we have to be at y<=3 at turn92.\n\nNow, is there a way to be higher at later turns?\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are free after δ=2, we can go directly if we can avoid δ=2 on middle rows.\n\nBut from y=4 at δ=0, to reach y=7, we need 3 ups, but at δ=2, we would be at y=7 if we go up, but y=7 occupied at δ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we delay.\n\nSuppose at turn90, go S to y4 at turn91.\n\nThen at turn91, go S to y4 at turn92? But at turn92 δ=2, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot stay.\n\nMust move down.\n\nGo D at turn91 to y3 at turn92.\n\nOnly option.\n\nPerhaps go to y=0 or something, but slower.\n\nAnother idea: since at δ=1, y=7 and 8 occupied, but we are not there.\n\nBut we can go up to y=6 at some point before δ=2, but at δ=2 y=6 occupied.\n\nNot possible to be on y=6 at δ=2.\n\nUnless we move away before.\n\nBut from y=6, to move to y=5 or y=7, but at δ=2, both occupied.\n\ny=5 and7 occupied at δ=2.\n\nNo.\n\nSo indeed, we must not be on y=4,5,6 at δ=2, and not on y=7,8 at δ=0,1,2.\n\nBut since we start at y=4, we need to move down to lower y by turn92.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=9, we reach at turn98.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nt_1=90\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 90: D  (to y=3 at turn91)\n\nTurn 91: S  (to y=3 at turn92)  // or D, but S is fine\n\nTurn 92: U  (to y=4 at turn93)\n\nTurn 93: U  (to y=5 at turn94)\n\nTurn 94: U  (to y=6 at turn95)\n\nTurn 95: U  (to y=7 at turn96)\n\nTurn 96: U  (to y=8 at turn97)\n\nTurn 97: U  (to y=9 at turn98)\n\nNow, at turn98, y=9.\n\nWe need actions up to a_{97} to reach at turn98.\n\nBut for H, position at t_1 + H -1 =98.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =98, 90 + H -1=98, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nSo actions from t=90 to t=90 + 8 =98? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =90 to 98.\n\nSo we need 9 actions: a_90 to a_98.\n\nBut with a_90 to a_97, we have 8 actions, and position at turn98 is 9.\n\na_97 is at turn97, which sets y at turn98.\n\nThen a_98 is at turn98, which we need to specify.\n\nSince at turn98 we are at y=9, we can set a_98 to S, for example.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nTurn 91: S  // stay at y=3\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: S\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt turn90 (δ=0): y=4, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction D, to y=3 at turn91.\n\nTurn91 (δ=1): y=3, not occupied (only δ=0 for y=3), safe.\n\nAction S, to y=3 at turn92.\n\nTurn92 (δ=2): y=3, not occupied, safe. (y=3 only occupied at δ=0, not δ=2)\n\nAction U, to y=4 at turn93.\n\nTurn93 (δ=3): y=4, not occupied (only δ=2), safe.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at turn94 (δ=4), safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at turn95 (δ=5), safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at turn96 (δ=6): y=7 at δ=6, not occupied (occupied δ=0,1,2,10,11,12), safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at turn97 (δ=7), similar, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at turn98? Action a_97 U at turn97, to y=9 at turn98.\n\nAt turn97: y=8, δ=7, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nThen at turn98: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nThen action a_98 S, but not necessary, but we include it.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=9, we have a_98.\n\nBut we could have a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose at turn91, instead of S, we go D to y=2 at turn92.\n\nThen at turn92 y=2.\n\nThen need to go up: a_92 U to y3 at93, a_93 U to y4 at94, ..., up to a_98 U to y9 at99, then at turn99 y=9, which requires H=10, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 at turn96 or something.\n\nBut at turn92 we are at y=3, min to y=9 is 6 actions: turn92 to turn97 for actions, position at turn98 y=9.\n\nTurn92 action to turn97 action, 6 actions, position from turn93 to turn98.\n\nAt turn92, after action, position at turn93.\n\nTo have position at turn T=98 y=9, we need actions from turn90 to turn97, 8 actions, H=8? Earlier calculation.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = position turn.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1 =98.\n\nWith actions a_90 to a_97, that's 8 actions, t=90 to97, which brings position to turn98 y=9.\n\nThen for H=8, t_1 + H -1 =90 +8 -1=97, but at turn97, y=8, not 9.\n\nIf we want position at turn97 to be 9, we need to be at y=9 at turn97.\n\nBut from y=3 at turn92, after 5 actions: a_92 U to y4 at93, a_93 U to y5 at94, a_94 U to y6 at95, a_95 U to y7 at96, a_96 U to y8 at97, so at turn97 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn97, we need to be at y=8 at turn96, etc., but from turn92 y=3, min turn to y=9 is turn98.\n\nUnless we start higher.\n\nBut at turn92, we are at y=3.\n\nIf at turn90 we go U, but we can't because it leads to collision.\n\nPerhaps go to y=6 before δ=2, but at δ=2 we have to leave, but we can't.\n\nFor example, at turn90, go U to y5 at turn91 (δ=1).\n\nThen at turn91, we cannot stay or go up, must go down to avoid turn92.\n\nBut at turn91 y=5, go D to y4 at turn92? But y=4 occupied at δ=2.\n\nGo S to y5, occupied.\n\nGo U to y6, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=4,5,6 at turn92.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's see if we can save a turn.\n\nAt turn90, go D to y3 at turn91.\n\nThen at turn91, instead of S, go U to y4 at turn92? But at turn92 δ=2, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo D to y2 at turn92, then from y2, it takes longer.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence I have is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn91, I have S to stay at y3, but we could go D to y2, but that would add a turn, so not better.\n\nSo with S at turn91, we stay at y3.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, occupied at δ=10,11,12, which is turn100,101,102, we reach by turn98, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn91, I set S, but we could set D, but S is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nH=9, actions from t=90 to t=98.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be for the given t_1.\n\nt_1=90.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nTurn 91: S\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: S  // to stay, but could be anything\n\nBut at turn98, we are at y=9, so action can be S.\n\nSince we reach at turn98, and action a_98 is specified, but position at turn98 is before action, so it's fine.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but we need to specify H actions.\n\nAnother thing: at turn91, if we go D to y2 at turn92, then from there, we might go up faster? No, from y2 to y9, min 7 steps, turn92 to turn98 for actions, position at turn99 y=9, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the car state for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn96, y=7 at δ=6, not occupied, yes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after δ=2.\n\nBut from y=3 at turn92, to y=9, min 6 U actions, arriving at turn98.\n\nNo way to do in 5, since from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so min 6 steps, but with actions, to go from y3 to y9, we need 6 U actions, each increasing by 1, so after 6 actions, y increases by 6, from y3 to y9.\n\nStart at turn92 y=3.\n\nAfter a_92 U, turn93 y=4\n\na_93 U, turn94 y=5\n\n...\n\na_97 U, turn98 y=9\n\nSo 6 actions from turn92 to turn97, to reach turn98 y=9.\n\nThen actions at turn90 and turn91 to get to turn92 y=3.\n\nWith a_90 D to y3 at turn91, and a_91 S to y3 at turn92, so two actions to be at turn92 y=3.\n\nThen 6 actions to reach turn98 y=9.\n\nTotal actions: a_90 to a_97, 8 actions, with position at turn98 y=9.\n\nThen for H=8, t_1 + H -1 =90 +8 -1=97, but at turn97, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at turn97 be 9, we would need to be at y=8 at turn96, for example.\n\nBut from turn92 y=3, after 4 actions: a_92 U to y4 at93, a_93 U to y5 at94, a_94 U to y6 at95, a_95 U to y7 at96, so at turn96 y=7, not 8.\n\nAfter 5 actions, turn97 y=8.\n\nStill not 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn98 from this start.\n\nIf we could be at y=4 at turn92, but we can't because occupied.\n\nSo yes, minimal H=9.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, for turn98, we need to specify action, so S is fine.\n\nNow, write in the format.\n\nAlso, in the initial, at turn90, if we go S instead of D, but then at turn91, we must go D to y3 at turn92, same thing, but we spent an extra turn at y=4, so it would be slower.\n\nFor example, a_90 S, to y4 at turn91\n\na_91 D, to y3 at turn92\n\nThen a_92 U, etc., same as before but now from turn92 same, but we have one extra action, so H=10 to reach turn99? Let's see.\n\na_90 S: at turn91 y=4\n\na_91 D: at turn92 y=3\n\nThen a_92 U to y4 at93, ..., a_97 U to y9 at98? From a_92 to a_97: 6 actions to y9 at turn98.\n\nActions: a_90 S, a_91 D, a_92 U, ..., a_97 U, so actions from t=90 to t=97, 8 actions, position at turn98 y=9.\n\nSame as before, but with a_90 S instead of D, and a_91 D instead of S.\n\nIn terms of number, still 8 actions to reach turn98, but with different first actions.\n\nIn this case, a_90 S, a_91 D, then same from a_92.\n\nBut in the first sequence, a_90 D, a_91 S, then a_92 U.\n\nBoth have 8 actions to set position at turn98 to 9.\n\nThen for H=9, we add a_98 S.\n\nBut in the sequence with a_90 S and a_91 D, we reach at turn98 with a_90 to a_97, same as before.\n\nBut with a_90 D and a_91 S, we also reach with a_90 to a_97.\n\nIn both cases, we need a_98 for H=9.\n\nBut the point is, with a_90 S and a_91 D, we have an extra move, but same arrival time.\n\nIn terms of H, same.\n\nBut in the first, with down and stay, we are at y=3 for two turns, which is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo minimize, but H is the same.\n\nNow, I think we can proceed.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nTurn 91: S  (or we can do D, but S is simpler)\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: S\n\nIn the sequence, turn 97: U to go to y=9 at turn98.\n\nThen turn 98: S to stay.\n\nBut in the action list, it's fine.\n\nSince after reaching, but we need to specify all actions.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at δ=0,1,2 occupied, which we avoided.\n\nAlso, at δ=10,11,12, but we are done.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nMinimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in H=8.\n\nSuppose position at turn97 y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =97, with H=8.\n\nThen 90 + 8 -1=97.\n\nNow, to have y=9 at turn97.\n\nFrom start, turn90 y=4.\n\nAfter 7 actions, to turn97.\n\ny from 4 to 9, delta 5, so min 5 U, but with constraints.\n\nAt turn92 (δ=2), we must be at y<=3.\n\nSuppose at turn92, we are at y=3.\n\nThen from turn92 to turn97, 5 actions: turn92,93,94,95,96.\n\nAfter 5 actions, position at turn97.\n\nFrom y=3 at turn92, after 5 actions, if all U, y=8 at turn97, not 9.\n\nIf we can be higher, but at turn92 we are at y=3.\n\nIf at turn92 we are at y=2, then after 5U, y=7 at turn97.\n\nWorse.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we can be at y=4 at turn92, but cannot.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn98.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 90\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 3\\) to avoid the occupied freeways at \\(\\delta = 2\\) (turn 92), then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) after \\(\\delta = 2\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- At \\(\\delta = 0\\) (turn 90), freeways 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 are occupied, but \\(y = 4\\) is safe.\n- At \\(\\delta = 1\\) (turn 91), freeways 7 and 8 are occupied, but \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), and \\(y = 5\\) are safe.\n- At \\(\\delta = 2\\) (turn 92), freeways 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are occupied, so the player must be on \\(y \\leq 3\\) or \\(y = 9\\) to avoid collision. The sequence ensures the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (safe) at this turn.\n- For \\(\\delta \\geq 3\\) (turns 93+), no freeways are occupied until \\(\\delta = 10\\) (turn 100), which is after the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 98.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 90**: Action \\(D\\) (down) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 91. This avoids staying at \\(y = 4\\) or moving up, which would lead to collision at turn 92.\n- **Turn 91**: Action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps \\(y = 3\\) at turn 92. This ensures the player is safe at \\(\\delta = 1\\) and prepares to avoid \\(\\delta = 2\\) on higher freeways.\n- **Turn 92**: Action \\(U\\) (up) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 93. \\(\\delta = 2\\) is past, and \\(y = 4\\) is now safe.\n- **Turns 93 to 97**: Actions \\(U\\) (up) each move up one row per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 98. All intermediate freeways are unoccupied during these turns.\n- **Turn 98**: Action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), but any action is valid as the goal is reached at this turn.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal \\(H = 9\\) turns, with position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 98 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 90 + 9 - 1 = 98\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 90: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and y only changes by at most 1 per turn, the minimum possible H is 9 turns if I go up every time. But I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since I need to reach 9, going down might not help unless I'm avoiding something.\n\nI should simulate the car positions over time to see when each freeway is safe at x=0.\n\nThe current turn is t_1 = 92. For each car, I need to compute its span at turn T for T >= 92.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)] but in the notation, for left-moving, head and tail are given, and it moves left, so decreasing x.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says head at h, tail at τ, and for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, but when it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head? But in the left-moving, it says [h, τ], so it might be inconsistent.\n\nLet me see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is left or right? If it's left-moving, head might be the front when moving left.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should look at the values.\n\nFor example, in freeway 7 and 8, there are cars like (48, 37, right, 4), and direction is right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] according to the text.\n\nIt says: for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn both cases, the span is given with min and max, I think. For left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, and since it's moving left, h decreases, so probably h is the right end, and τ is the left end? I need to clarify.\n\nLet's think logically. When a car is moving, the head is the front, so for right-moving, head is at higher x, tail at lower x, so Span should be [tail, head] for the positions.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head at lower x, tail at higher x? No.\n\nStandard: when we say head and tail, head is the front. So:\n\n- If moving right, head is at larger x, tail at smaller x, so span is [tail, head] = [smaller x, larger x].\n\n- If moving left, head is at smaller x, tail at larger x, so span is [head, tail] = [smaller x, larger x].\n\nIn the text, for left-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which from above, for left-moving, h should be smaller, τ larger, so [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nThen Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], so both decrease, which makes sense for left movement.\n\nFor right-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" but then Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so it must be that τ is tail, smaller x, h is head, larger x, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], both increase.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1 to 6, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s), but for freeway 7 and 8, it's listed with multiple cars, each with (h, τ, d, s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h], but here h and τ are given as head and tail positions.\n\nGiven: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSo head = -48, tail = -83? But for right-moving, head should be larger than tail, but -48 > -83, so head = -48, tail = -83, so τ = tail = -83, h = head = -48, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-83, -48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, at turn T, for this car, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-83 + 36(T-92), -48 + 36(T-92)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same: (-48, -83, right, 36) so same as above.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: (-48, -71, right, 24) so head = -48, tail = -71, direction right, speed 24.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nSpan(T) = [-71 + 24(T-92), -48 + 24(T-92)]\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFor each, Span(t_1) and Span(T).\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, so τ=37, h=48, Span(t_1) = [37,48]\n\nSpan(T) = [37 + 4(T-92), 48 + 4(T-92)]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, τ=1, h=12, Span(t_1) = [1,12]\n\nSpan(T) = [1 + 4(T-92), 12 + 4(T-92)]\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, τ=-35, h=-24, Span(t_1) = [-35,-24]\n\nSpan(T) = [-35 + 4(T-92), -24 + 4(T-92)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4) so identical to freeway 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car on that freeway.\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, note: when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, but during turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only considered on y_T for collision at turn T.\n\nSo for each turn, we care about the car on the current y-position.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 92 onwards to reach y=9 asap.\n\nStart at y_{92} = 0.\n\nAt y=0, there is no freeway, so no car, always safe. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no car.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, each with cars.\n\nI need to go through y=1 to 8, but I can stay or move up/down, so I might not go directly; I could stay at some y or go down to avoid, but since I need to reach 9, going down might delay, so probably minimal time is by going up when possible.\n\nBut I need to check when each freeway is safe at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k=1 to 8, and for each turn T, I need to see if at turn T, for that freeway, is there a car such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThen for the player, I need to be at some y at each turn, and when I am on y, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nI start at y=0 at T=92, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T=92+H, but since I move step by step, y changes slowly.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, if I go up every turn from 92 to 100, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway y when it is occupied at x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 is covered by some car.\n\nThen I can plan the path.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the span changes linearly, so the unsafe periods are intervals, and I can find when 0 is not in any span for each freeway.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need the union of spans when 0 is covered.\n\nThen the freeway is safe when no car covers 0.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: only one car? The table says for freeway 1: \"Cars: (-48, -83, right, 36)\" so one car.\n\nSimilarly for 2 and 3, same.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: one car each, same.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: multiple cars.\n\nBut freeway 7 has three cars, similarly freeway 8.\n\nNow for each, let's find when 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nSet t = T - 92, so t=0 at current turn.\n\nThen for a car, Span(T) = Span(92 + t) as above.\n\nCollision at T if for car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor freeway 1: car with Span(T) = [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t] where t = T-92\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36t <= 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nSince -48 + 36t <= 0 or >=0? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -83 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t <= 2 since t integer? t is turn offset, integer.\n\nT is turn number, so t = T - 92 is integer.\n\nSimilarly, all positions are integers, I think, since head and tail are integers.\n\nSo t integer.\n\n-83 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 = 2.305, so t <= 2\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 36t => 48 <= 36t => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so t >= 2 since t integer? t >= 2.\n\nt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nt <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2\n\nSo t=2\n\nWhen t=2, -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true\n\n-48 + 36*2 = -48 + 72 = 24 >=0? 24 >=0 true, so 0 between -11 and 24, yes.\n\nFor t=1: -83 +36= -47 <=0, -48+36= -12 <=0, so 0 not <= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so 0 not in [-47,-12] since both negative.\n\nFor t=3: -83 +108=25, -48+108=60, both positive, 0 not in [25,60]\n\nSo only at t=2, 0 in span for freeway 1 car.\n\nt=2 means T=92+2=94\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, same as freeway 1? Freeway 2 also has (-48,-83,right,36), so identical, unsafe only at T=94.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, unsafe at T=94.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nSpan(T) = [-71 + 24t, -48 + 24t]\n\n0 in span if -71 +24t <=0 <= -48 +24t\n\nFirst, -71 +24t <=0 => 24t <=71 => t <=71/24≈2.958, so t<=2\n\n0 <= -48 +24t => 48 <=24t => t >=2\n\nSo t=2\n\nAt t=2: -71 +48= -23 <=0, -48+48=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\n-48 +24*2 = -48+48=0, so min=-71+48=-23, max=0, so 0 <=0, included.\n\nFor t=1: -71+24= -47 <=0, -48+24= -24 <=0, both neg, 0 not in.\n\nt=3: -71+72=1, -48+72=24, both pos, 0 not in.\n\nSo only t=2, T=94.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same, unsafe only at T=94.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) so head=48, tail=37, Span(T) = [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if 37+4t <=0 <=48+4t\n\nBut 37+4t >=37>0, so min>0, 0 cannot be <= min since min>0, so 0 never in span for this car. Always safe from this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4) Span(T) = [1 + 4t, 12 + 4t]\n\n0 in span: 1+4t <=0 <=12+4t\n\n1+4t <=0? 4t <= -1, t <= -0.25, impossible since t>=0, so min=1+4t >=1>0, so 0 never <= min, so never in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35? τ=-35, h=-24, Span(T) = [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4t <=0 <= -24 +4t\n\nSo -35 +4t <=0 => 4t <=35 => t <=35/4=8.75, t<=8\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +4t => 24 <=4t => t >=6\n\nSo t from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nt=6: min= -35+24= -11 <=0, max= -24+24=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so in.\n\nt=7: min= -35+28= -7 <=0, max= -24+28=4 >=0, so 0 in.\n\nt=8: min= -35+32= -3 <=0, max= -24+32=8 >=0, so in.\n\nt=5: min= -35+20= -15 <=0, max= -24+20= -4 <=0, 0 not <= -4? 0 <= -4 false, so not in.\n\nt=9: min= -35+36=1, max= -24+36=12, both pos, not in.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe when t=6,7,8, i.e., T=98,99,100? t=6,7,8, T=92+t, so T=98,99,100.\n\nt=0 at T=92, so t=6 is T=98, t=7 T=99, t=8 T=100.\n\nNow freeway 8 has the same cars, so identical to freeway 7, unsafe at T=98,99,100.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe at which turns:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=94\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=94\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=94\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=94\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=94\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=94\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=98,99,100\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=98,99,100\n\nAnd safe at all other times.\n\nNow, the player starts at T=92, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, we choose action: U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no car.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from t_1=92.\n\nH is the number of actions, so after H turns, we are at turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nDefine: at turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, then position at turn t_1 +1 is updated.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, and position should be (0,9).\n\nThe player position: at turn t_1, we are at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we move to y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we are at y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} = 9? After H actions, we have taken actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1, so we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at y_{t_1} =0, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 moves up, so minimal H=9, ending at turn t_1+9=101.\n\nBut with possible stays or downs, H could be larger.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so H=9 if possible: from T=92 to T=101, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut we need to be safe at each turn for the y we are on.\n\nAt each turn T, we are at y_T, and it must be that either y_T not in 1-8, or if in 1-8, it must be safe at T.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, for the direct path: go up every turn from T=92 to T=100, y from 0 to 8 at T=100, then at T=101, y=9.\n\nList:\n\nTurn T | y_T | action to get there? At turn T, we are at y_T after the action of previous turn.\n\nAt turn T=92, we are at y=0, before any action at this turn.\n\nThen we take action a_{92}, which determines y_{93}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking a_T, we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nDefine the state at turn T.\n\nAt the start of turn T, we are at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which causes Δy, and we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with bounds.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at (0, y_{T+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nFor turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check if 0 in span for any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf moving, when we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, during turn T we are on y_T, so collision based on y_T.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nStart at T=92, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some later turn.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, actions at T=92 to T=100: all U, so y_{93}=1, y_{94}=2, ..., y_{101}=9.\n\nNow, check safety at each turn:\n\nAt T=92, y=0, safe.\n\nT=93, y=1: freeway y=1, unsafe only at T=94? T=93: is y=1 safe at T=93?\n\nFrom above, y=1 unsafe only at T=94, so at T=93, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=94, y=2: but y=2 is freeway 2, unsafe at T=94! Oh, at T=94, if we are on y=2, it is unsafe.\n\nIn this path, at T=94, we are at y=2 (since y_{94}=2), and y=2 is unsafe at T=94, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on any y=1 to 6 at T=94, it would be unsafe, but in this case y=2.\n\ny=1 to 6 all unsafe at T=94.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=2 at T=94, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on any freeway y=1 to 6 at T=94.\n\nBut at T=94, we need to not be on y=1 to 6.\n\ny=0 or y=7,8,9 but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at T=94? From above, y=7 unsafe at T=98,99,100, so at T=94, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at T=94.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo to avoid collision at T=94, we must be at y=0, or y=7, or y=8, or y=9 at turn T=94.\n\nBut in the direct up path, we are at y=2 at T=94, not good.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nSince we start from y=0, and need to reach y=9, we can be at y=0 at T=94 or go to higher y.\n\nBut at T=94, if we are at y=0, safe, or y=7 or 8, safe.\n\nBut y=7 or 8 might be far.\n\nWe can stay at y=0 for one turn or something.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nList the unsafe times:\n\nT=94: y=1 to 6 unsafe\n\nT=98,99,100: y=7 and 8 unsafe\n\nNow, for the player path.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on y=1-6 at T=94, and avoid y=7 or 8 at T=98,99,100.\n\nSince we start at T=92, y=0.\n\nLet me denote the turn from T=92 onwards.\n\nAt T=92: y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we take action a_92, which sets y_{93}.\n\nThen at T=93, we are at y_{93}, must be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince t_1=92, let’s use absolute turn numbers.\n\nPossible to reach y=9 by T=101 with H=9, but we saw that at T=94, y=2 would be unsafe.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=1-6 at T=94.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Be at y=0 at T=94\n\n- Be at y=7 at T=94\n\n- Be at y=8 at T=94\n\nBut y=7 or 8 at T=94 might be hard to reach from y=0 in few turns.\n\nFrom T=92 to T=94, that's two actions: a92 and a93.\n\nAt T=92, y=0.\n\nAfter a92, y93 = 0 + Δy92\n\nThen at T=93, position y93.\n\nAfter a93, y94 = y93 + Δy93\n\nThen at T=94, position y94.\n\nWe need y94 to be 0,7, or8 to be safe at T=94.\n\nNow, from y=0, in two moves, what y can we reach?\n\nPossible actions:\n\nIf a92=S, y93=0\n\nThen a93=S, y94=0\n\nOr a93=U, y94=1\n\nOr a93=D, y94=0? y min 0, so D at y=0, if a93=D, y93=0, then y94 = y93 + (-1) but y93=0, so y94 = max(0, -1) =0, since y>=0.\n\nSimilarly, if a92=U, y93=1\n\nThen a93: if S, y94=1\n\nIf U, y94=2\n\nIf D, y94=0\n\nSimilarly, a92=D, but y=0, a92=D, y93=0\n\nThen same as above.\n\nSo from y=0 in two moves:\n\n- If both S: y94=0\n\n- S then U: y93=0, y94=1\n\n- U then S: y93=1, y94=1\n\n- U then U: y93=1, y94=2\n\n- U then D: y93=1, y94=0\n\n- D then S: y93=0, y94=0\n\netc., but essentially possible y94: 0,1, or 2.\n\nCannot reach y=7 or 8 in two moves from y=0.\n\nMax y=2 if go up twice.\n\nSo at T=94, we can only be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut to be safe at T=94, we need y94=0, since y=1 or 2 are unsafe.\n\nSo only possible to be at y=0 at T=94.\n\nThus, we must have y94=0.\n\nThat means at T=94, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we also have later unsafe times at T=98,99,100 for y=7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's set y94=0.\n\nNow, from T=92 to T=94:\n\nAt T=92, y=0.\n\nTo have y94=0, we need to not go up, or go down.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: a92=S, then y93=0\n\nThen a93=S, y94=0\n\nOr a92=S, a93=D, but y93=0, a93=D, y94=0\n\nOr a92=U, y93=1, then a93=D, y94=0\n\nOr a92=D, y93=0, a93=S, y94=0, etc.\n\nAll fine, as long as y94=0.\n\nNow, since we want minimal H, we should not waste moves, so probably best to stay or minimal action.\n\nFor example, a92=S and a93=S: stay at y=0 for two turns.\n\nOr a92=U and a93=D: go up and down, back to 0.\n\nBut that might not be efficient, but for now, we need to get to y=9.\n\nAfter T=94, we are at y=0 at T=94.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal from here would be to go up every turn, but we have to avoid the unsafe times for y=7 and 8 at T=98,99,100.\n\nIf we go up from y=0 at T=94.\n\nSet T=94, y=0.\n\nThen if we go up each turn:\n\nT=94: y=0, safe\n\na94=U, y95=1\n\nT=95: y=1, safe? y=1 unsafe only at T=94, which is past, so at T=95, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a95=U, y96=2\n\nT=96: y=2, safe\n\na96=U, y97=3\n\nT=97: y=3, safe\n\na97=U, y98=4\n\nT=98: y=4? Now, at T=98, y=4, which freeway? y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nIs y=4 unsafe at T=98? From earlier, y=4 unsafe only at T=94, so at T=98, safe.\n\nBut we also have y=7 and 8 unsafe at T=98,99,100, but here y=4, not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nContinue: a98=U, y99=5\n\nT=99: y=5, safe (unsafe only at T=94)\n\na99=U, y100=6\n\nT=100: y=6, safe\n\na100=U, y101=7\n\nT=101: y=7? At T=101, y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at T=98,99,100, but T=101, is it unsafe?\n\nFrom earlier, y=7 unsafe at T=98,99,100, so at T=101, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at T=98,99,100, so T=101 safe.\n\nIn this path: at T=101, y=7.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\na101=U, y102=8\n\nT=102: y=8, now at T=102, is y=8 safe? Unsafe only at T=98,99,100, so T=102 safe.\n\na102=U, y103=9\n\nT=103: y=9, goal.\n\nBut H: we started from T=92, actions from a92 to a102? Let's count.\n\nAt T=92: start, y=0\n\nAfter actions: a92 to a102, that's 11 actions? T=92 to T=102, 11 turns? Turns: from T=92 to T=103, positions.\n\nList turns and y:\n\nT | y_T (position at turn T)\n\n92: y=0\n\nAfter a92: y93 = ... \n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + a_T effect.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence for minimal H to reach y=9.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9, with t_1=92.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 92 + H, y=9.\n\nStart at turn 92, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 92 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the above, to have y94=0, we need to take actions at 92 and 93 such that we end up at y94=0.\n\nThen from there, in the path I described, at T=94, y=0\n\nThen go up:\n\na94=U, y95=1\n\nT=95: y=1, safe\n\na95=U, y96=2\n\nT=96: y=2, safe\n\na96=U, y97=3\n\nT=97: y=3, safe\n\na97=U, y98=4\n\nT=98: y=4, safe (since only unsafe at 94)\n\na98=U, y99=5\n\nT=99: y=5, safe\n\na99=U, y100=6\n\nT=100: y=6, safe\n\na100=U, y101=7\n\nT=101: y=7, now at T=101, y=7 is safe? Unsafe at 98,99,100, so 101 safe.\n\na101=U, y102=8\n\nT=102: y=8, safe\n\na102=U, y103=9\n\nT=103: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, actions taken: from a92 to a102, that's 11 actions: T=92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102.\n\nH=11 actions, to reach at turn 103.\n\nBut we started at turn 92, position, and after 11 actions, at turn 103, position.\n\nt_1=92, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nHere t_1 + H = 103, so H=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? We wasted two turns at the beginning to stay at y=0.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by going to higher y earlier.\n\nBut earlier we couldn't reach y=7 at T=94.\n\nT=94 is only two turns from T=92, max y=2.\n\nWe could go up to y=6 before T=94 and then down or something, but let's see.\n\nAt T=94, we must not be on y=1-6, so we must be at y=0, since we can't be at y=7 or 8.\n\ny=7 or 8 at T=94 is impossible from start in two moves.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=94.\n\nThen from there, we go up, but we have the later issue with y=7 and 8.\n\nIn the above path, when we reach y=7 at T=101, which is after the unsafe period, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=102 safe.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 or 8 during the unsafe times but not on the freeway? No, if we are on it, we collide.\n\nUnless we are not on it at that turn.\n\nFor example, at T=98,99,100, we need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nBut we need to go through them to reach y=9.\n\nWe can be on y=7 or 8 at other times.\n\nIn the above path, we are on y=7 at T=101, which is safe.\n\nBut we could be on y=7 earlier, but during T=98,99,100 it is unsafe, so we need to avoid those turns.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, in the path above, from T=94 y=0, we go up to y=4 at T=98, etc.\n\nT=94 y=0\n\nT=95 y=1\n\nT=96 y=2\n\nT=97 y=3\n\nT=98 y=4\n\n...\n\nUp to T=101 y=7\n\nWe reached y=7 at T=101.\n\nThe unsafe for y=7 is T=98,99,100, so T=101 is fine.\n\nBut we could reach y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, from T=94 y=0, if we go up faster.\n\nBut we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=94, to reach y=7, we need at least 7 turns: T=95 y=1, T=96 y=2, ..., T=101 y=7? T=94 y=0, after one up, T=95 y=1, ..., after k ups, T=94+k y=k.\n\nSo at T=94+7=101, y=7, same as above.\n\nCannot reach earlier than T=101 for y=7 from T=94.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=102, y=9 at T=103.\n\nBut we have the unsafe period at T=98,99,100 for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn this path, we are not on y=7 or 8 during those turns, since at T=98 y=4, T=99 y=5, T=100 y=6, all safe.\n\nThen at T=101 y=7, safe.\n\nBut H=11 from start.\n\nt_1=92, actions from a92 to a102, H=11 actions.\n\nBut we might reduce by not staying at y=0 for two turns.\n\nAt the beginning, to have y94=0, we don't need to stay both turns; we can go up and down.\n\nFor example, at T=92, a92=U, y93=1\n\nThen at T=93, y=1, which is safe since unsafe only at T=94.\n\nThen a93=D, y94=0\n\nThen at T=94, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we continue as before.\n\nNow, from here, we still need to go to y=9.\n\nSame as before, y at T=94:0, T=95:1, T=96:2, T=97:3, T=98:4, T=99:5, T=100:6, T=101:7, T=102:8, T=103:9.\n\nActions: a92=U, a93=D, then a94=U to a102=U.\n\na102=U to y103=9.\n\nNumber of actions: a92 to a102, 11 actions.\n\nSame as staying.\n\nBut we moved, but ended up same.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by not going down later, but we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=94 we must be at y=0, but after that, we can go up, but when we reach y=7, we need to not be at T=98,99,100.\n\nIn the above, we are at y=7 at T=101, which is safe.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=7 earlier if we start from higher, but we start from low.\n\nFrom T=92 to T=94, we are constrained to be at y=0 at T=94.\n\nWe could go to y=6 before T=94 and then down to y=0 at T=94, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example: at T=92, a92=U, y93=1\n\nT=93, y=1, safe\n\na93=U, y94=2\n\nBut at T=94, y=2, unsafe! Cannot.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=94, we must have y94=0, so we cannot be at higher y at T=94.\n\nSo only options are to stay or go down to 0.\n\nThus, minimal from start is to have y94=0, which takes at least two actions: for example, S and S, or U and D, etc., but in both cases, after two actions, y94=0.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, it takes 9 actions: 9 ups.\n\nSo total actions: 2 (to stay at 0) + 9 (to go to 9) = 11 actions.\n\nBut with the U and D, it's still 11 actions.\n\nNow, we have the later unsafe times, but in this path, we are not affected because we pass y=7 and 8 after T=100.\n\nBut we could optimize the path to avoid the later unsafe times with less delay.\n\nFor example, after T=94, we go up to y=6 or something and wait, but since we need to go up, waiting might increase H.\n\nAt T=100, y=6 in the path, which is safe.\n\nThen we go to y=7 at T=101.\n\nBut T=101 is safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no need to wait.\n\nBut we have to pass y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at T=98,99,100, so we can be on y=7 at T=97 or T=101, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the current path, we are on y=7 at T=101, which is fine.\n\nBut can we be on y=7 earlier?\n\nFrom T=94 y=0, the earliest to be at y=7 is T=101.\n\nT=94: y=0\n\nT=95: y=1 after a94=U\n\n...\n\nT=101: y=7 after a100=U? Let's index.\n\nAt T=94, y=0\n\na94=U → y95=1\n\nT=95, y=1\n\na95=U → y96=2\n\n...\n\na100=U → y101=7\n\nT=101, y=7\n\nYes.\n\nIf we want to be at y=7 at T=97, for example.\n\nT=97: y=7\n\nThen from T=94 y=0, to T=97 y=7, that's 3 turns: T=95,96,97.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=7 in 3 turns? But each turn change by at most 1, so from y=0 at T=94 to y=7 at T=97, impossible because at T=97, y=7, so it took 7 steps up, so must have started from T=94 - k with y lower, but at T=94 y=0, so to y=7 at T=97, it would require y at T=95,96,97.\n\nT=94: y=0\n\nAfter a94: y95\n\nAfter a95: y96\n\nAfter a96: y97\n\ny97=7\n\nSo from y95 to y97, y changes from y95 to y97, with two actions a95 and a96.\n\nMax increase: if y95=5, then a95=U y96=6, a96=U y97=7, so y95 must be at least 5.\n\nBut at T=95, y95, which comes from a94 from y94=0.\n\ny95 = y94 + Δa94\n\nIf a94=U, y95=1\n\nThen y95=1, then to y97=7, need y96 and y97.\n\ny96 = y95 + Δa95\n\ny97 = y96 + Δa96\n\nIf y95=1, then to y97=7, need increase of 6 in two steps, impossible, max increase 2.\n\nSimilarly, if a94=U, y95=1, then even if both a95 and a96=U, y96=2, y97=3, not 7.\n\nTo have y97=7, we need y95=5, for example, then a95=U y96=6, a96=U y97=7.\n\nBut y95=5, which from y94=0, a94 must make y95=5, impossible, since max y95=1 if a94=U.\n\nThus, from y94=0, the earliest to reach y=7 is T=101, as before.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=102.\n\nSo no faster way.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach in 10 or less.\n\nSuppose H=10, so we reach y=9 at turn 92+10=102.\n\nThen we start at T=92 y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at T=102 y=9.\n\nNow, y at each turn.\n\nAt T=94, must be y=0 to be safe.\n\nSo at T=94, y=0.\n\nThen from T=94 to T=102, 8 turns to go from y=0 to y=9, which requires at least 9 steps? From y=0 to y=9, need 9 increases, but in 8 turns? Turns from T=94 to T=102.\n\nAt T=94, y=0\n\nThen after actions a94 to a101, y at T=95 to T=102.\n\ny102 = y after a101.\n\ny102 =9.\n\nThe y values: y94=0, y95, y96, ..., y102=9.\n\nThe differences: y102 - y94 =9, and there are 8 steps (actions a94 to a101), each step changes y by at most +1, so max increase is 8, but 9>8, impossible to increase by 9 in 8 steps.\n\ny102 - y94 = (y102 - y101) + (y101 - y100) + ... + (y95 - y94) but each |Δy| <=1, so |y102 - y94| <= number of actions between.\n\nActions from a94 to a101: that's 8 actions, each can increase y by at most 1, so y101 <= y94 + 8 = 0 + 8 =8\n\nThen y102 = y101 + Δa101 <= 8 +1 =9, but to be exactly 9, need y101=8 and a101=U.\n\nBut y101 <=8, and y102=9 only if y101=8 and a101=U.\n\nBut y101 <= y94 + 7? Let's see the number of actions.\n\nFrom y94 to y102: after 8 actions, y102 = y94 + sum_{i=94}^{101} Δa_i\n\nEach Δa_i <=1, so y102 <= y94 + 8 = 8\n\nSimilarly, y102 >= y94 -8 = -8, but since y>=0, y102 <=8.\n\nBut we need y102=9, impossible.\n\nThus, from y94=0, we cannot reach y=9 in 8 actions (to T=102), max y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least 9 actions after T=94.\n\nThus, minimal actions: 2 to reach y94=0 (from start), plus 9 to reach y=9, total 11 actions.\n\nWith H=11, we reach at T=103.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the path, we have to choose how to get to y94=0.\n\nFor example, we can do a92=S, a93=S, then all U from a94 to a102.\n\nOr a92=U, a93=D, then a94 to a102 all U.\n\nBoth work.\n\nTo minimize actions, but both 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can save one action by not going down, but we have to be at y=0 at T=94.\n\nAnother way: we could go to y=6 at T=93 and then down to y=0 at T=94, but that takes more actions.\n\nFor example: a92=U, y93=1\n\nThen a93=U, but y93=1, a93=U, y94=2, but then at T=94 y=2, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\na92=U, y93=1\n\na93=D, y94=0, safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nOr a92=S, y93=0\n\na93=S, y94=0\n\nThen proceed.\n\nIn terms of number, same.\n\nNow, for the later part, we go up every turn, but at the unsafe times for y=7,8, we are not there yet.\n\nBut when we go to y=7 at T=101, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions from t_1=92 to t_1 + H -1 =92+11-1=102? Let's see the answer format.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo t from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9)\n\nIn this case, t_1=92, H=11, so actions from a92 to a92+10= a102.\n\nThen at turn 103, y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, we have to avoid the later unsafe times, but in this path, we are fine.\n\nBut let's confirm for y=7 and 8.\n\nAt T=101, y=7, which is freeway 7, unsafe at T=98,99,100, not 101, so safe.\n\nSimilarly T=102 y=8, unsafe at 98,99,100, not 102, safe.\n\nT=103 y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for the beginning, let's choose a sequence.\n\nFor example: to have y94=0, we can do a92=S, a93=S.\n\nThen a94=U, a95=U, a96=U, a97=U, a98=U, a99=U, a100=U, a101=U, a102=U.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nT=92: y=0 (start)\n\na92=S → y93=0\n\nT=93: y=0\n\na93=S → y94=0\n\nT=94: y=0\n\na94=U → y95=1\n\nT=95: y=1\n\na95=U → y96=2\n\nT=96: y=2\n\na96=U → y97=3\n\nT=97: y=3\n\na97=U → y98=4\n\nT=98: y=4\n\na98=U → y99=5\n\nT=99: y=5\n\na99=U → y100=6\n\nT=100: y=6\n\na100=U → y101=7\n\nT=101: y=7\n\na101=U → y102=8\n\nT=102: y=8\n\na102=U → y103=9\n\nT=103: y=9\n\nAll safe, as checked.\n\nWith a92=U, a93=D: same positions except at T=93.\n\na92=U → y93=1\n\nT=93: y=1, which is safe, since unsafe only at T=94.\n\nThen a93=D → y94=0\n\nT=94: y=0\n\nThen same as above.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nNow, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10? We saw impossible because to reach y=9 from y=0 in 10 actions, but with the constraint at T=94, we must be at y=0, so from there, max to y=8 in 8 actions, not 9.\n\nWithout constraint, direct in 9 actions to y=9 at T=101, but at T=94 y=2, unsafe, not possible.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the output, we need the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we also need to handle the later unsafe times, but in this case, we are not on y=7 or 8 during T=98,99,100.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by being on y=7 before or after.\n\nBut cannot.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are unsafe at T=98,99,100, we can be on them at T=97 or T=101, etc.\n\nBut from start, we are late.\n\nWe could go to y=8 or something and wait, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up directly to y=6 quickly.\n\nBut at T=94 we must be at y=0.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at T=94, then go up, but pause at some safe y during unsafe times, but since we need to go up, pausing would increase H.\n\nFor example, at T=100, if we are at y=6, we go to y=7 at T=101, but if we stay at y=6 at T=100, then at T=101 y=6 or 7, but to go to 7, we need to move, so we might delay.\n\nBut in this case, no need, since at T=101 we can go to y=7 safely.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the path we have is fine with H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's output one.\n\nUse a92=S, a93=S, then all U.\n\nBut we need to list the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nt_1=92.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\n\nAfter a102=U, y103=9, reached.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nTo make it shorter, but cannot.\n\nWith a92=U and a93=D:\n\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\n\nSame number.\n\nIn this case, at T=93, we were at y=1, which was safe.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n\nBut let's double-check the car states, especially for freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, at T=101, y=7, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 7, cars: we have the third car unsafe at t=6,7,8, which is T=98,99,100.\n\nAt T=101, t=101-92=9, Span for third car: [-35 + 4*9, -24 + 4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars never unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the sequence can be, for example:\n\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\n\nIn the sequence, Turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 10 for H=11.\n\na92 to a102.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, for Turn 92: a_{92}, etc.\n\nAlso, in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so we need to list the turns.\n\nSince t_1=92, we can list.\n\nBut in the answer, it might be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can start with U and D to save, but same H.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 92\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the sequence of actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn. The unsafe turns for each freeway are determined as follows:\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 94\\) (i.e., when \\(t = T - 92 = 2\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 98, 99, 100\\) (i.e., when \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n\nThe player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn \\(T = 94\\) to avoid collision, as it is impossible to reach \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) from \\(y = 0\\) in the two turns available (from \\(T = 92\\) to \\(T = 94\\)). From \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 94\\), it takes at least 9 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\), resulting in a minimal \\(H = 11\\) (2 turns to reach \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 94\\) and 9 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 103\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 92, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 93.\n- At turn 93, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 94 (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars).\n- From turn 94 to turn 102, move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 103, avoiding the unsafe periods:\n  - At \\(T = 98, 99, 100\\), the player is at \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) (safe, as these freeways are only unsafe at \\(T = 94\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 101\\), the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 98, 99, 100\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 102\\), the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 98, 99, 100\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 103\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 11\\) actions and is minimal, as \\(H = 10\\) is impossible due to the requirement to be at \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 94\\) and the maximum increase of 8 in \\(y\\) over 8 actions from \\(y = 0\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 92: S \\\\\nTurn 93: S \\\\\nTurn 94: U \\\\\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: U \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U \\\\\nTurn 99: U \\\\\nTurn 100: U \\\\\nTurn 101: U \\\\\nTurn 102: U\n}",

The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 on that freeway at the turn I'm there.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. The position is given at turn t_1 = 94, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T = 94.\n\nPlayer is at (0,0), so y=0. I need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up) increases y by 1, D (down) decreases by 1, S (stay) keeps y same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, for cars, each freeway has cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so position increases with time. Left means moving left, position decreases.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor left-moving, if it's moving left, positions decrease, so head is greater than tail? I think I need to interpret head and tail.\n\nLooking at the notation:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves to [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so since it's moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nBut in the span [h, τ], if h is head and τ is tail, and it's moving left, head should be the front, which is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" → [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so here for right-moving, it's given as [tail, head] I think, since tail is smaller.\n\nLet's see the notation:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it becomes [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it becomes [h - s dt, τ - s dt]. If h is head and τ is tail, and moving left, head should be decreasing, so if [h, τ], with h > τ, then after moving left, [h - s dt, τ - s dt], which makes sense, positions decrease.\n\nBut in the span, for left-moving it's written as [h, τ], which might imply h to τ, but if h > τ, it's decreasing order, but mathematically it's a set of points.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nBut in the collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T when player is on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that at turn T, when player moves to y_{T+1}, they are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, when you are at position y at turn T, you check for cars on freeway y at that exact turn T, and collision if 0 in Span for that freeway at T.\n\nIf you move to a new row at turn T, you are on that row only at turn T, and you check collision for that row at that turn.\n\nBut when you move, at turn T, you are at y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}. So at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you check collision for row y_T at turn T.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, you are on row y_{T+1}, and you check for row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIf you stay, y_{T+1} = y_T, so you are on same row at T and T+1.\n\nIf you move up or down, you change row at the next turn.\n\nNow, in this case, player starts at (0,0) at turn 94. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but I need to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the banks, I assume no cars there, so safe to be there.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0, no collision possible, similarly at y=9.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\nCurrently at y=0.\n\nI can move up to y=1, but I have to avoid the cars when I'm on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 94.\n\nFor each car, I need to find when 0 is in their span for each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nDirection is right, but the span is given as (-48, -83, right, 36). But for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h, but here -48 and -83, -48 > -83, so -48 is larger, so τ = -83, h = -48? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nBut for right-moving, if direction right, head should be the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail.\n\nHere h = -48, τ = -83, since -48 > -83, so head is at -48, tail at -83, so the car is from -83 to -48, which is length 35, and moving right with speed 36.\n\nSpeed is 36, but positions, and time in turns.\n\nSpan at t_1=94: for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [-83 + 36(T - 94), -48 + 36(T - 94)]\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) so h=-48, τ=-71, since -48 > -71, so [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nAt T: [-71 + 24(T-94), -48 + 24(T-94)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7: has three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFor each, head and tail.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, so [τ, h] = [37, 48] at t_1=94\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, so [1,12]\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, so [-35, -24]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway and turn T, if there is a car whose span includes 0 at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the union of spans.\n\nCollision if 0 is in any of the spans at that turn for that freeway.\n\nNow, time T relative to t_1=94.\n\nSet t = T - 94, so t=0 at current turn.\n\nThen for each freeway, find when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: car span at time t (from now) is [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\n0 is in this if -83 + 36t <= 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nSimilarly, since only one car.\n\nSo -83 + 36t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nFrom first: 36t <= 83, t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t <= 2 since t integer? t is turn number, so integer.\n\nT is turn, so t = T - 94 is integer, yes.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36t => 36t >= 48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so t >= 2 since t integer? t >= ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's see.\n\nt >= 48/36 = 4/3 = 1 + 1/3, so t >= 2 since t integer.\n\nSimilarly, t <= 83/36 = 2 + 11/36 ≈ 2.305, so t <= 2.\n\nt <= 2 and t >= 2, so only t=2.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nLower bound: -83 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 = 2.305... so t <= 2\n\nUpper bound: 0 <= -48 + 36t => 36t >= 48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so t >= 2\n\nThus t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, which is turn T=94+2=96, on freeway 1, 0 is in the span.\n\nFor other t, not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so also only at t=2, collision possible.\n\nFreeway 3: same, t=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: car [-71 + 24t, -48 + 24t]\n\n0 in span: -71 + 24t <= 0 <= -48 + 24t\n\nFirst: -71 + 24t <= 0 => 24t <= 71 => t <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so t <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 24t => 24t >= 48 => t >= 2\n\nSo t=2.\n\nt <= 2 and t >= 2, so t=2.\n\n71/24 = 2.958, so t <= 2 since t integer? t <= floor(2.958) = 2? No.\n\nt <= 71/24 = 2.958, since t integer, t <= 2.\n\nt >= 48/24 = 2 exactly? 24t >= 48, t >= 2.\n\n-48 + 24t >= 0? 0 <= -48 + 24t, so -48 + 24t >= 0, 24t >= 48, t >= 2.\n\nAnd -71 + 24t <= 0, 24t <= 71, t <= 71/24 = 2.958, so t <= 2 since t integer.\n\nt <= 2 and t >= 2, so t=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t] at time t, since at t=0: [37,48], then [37+4t, 48+4t]\n\n0 in this? 37+4t <= 0 <= 48+4t? But 37+4t >= 37 > 0 for t>=0, so 0 < 37+4t, so never <=0, so 0 not in [37+4t,48+4t] since left end >0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [1 + 4t, 12 + 4t]\n\n0 in this: 1+4t <= 0 <= 12+4t\n\n1+4t <=0 => 4t <= -1, t <= -0.25, impossible for t>=0.\n\n0 <= 12+4t always true, but 1+4t <=0 false, so no.\n\nThird car: [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\n0 in this: -35 + 4t <= 0 <= -24 + 4t\n\nFirst: -35 + 4t <= 0 => 4t <= 35 => t <= 35/4 = 8.75, so t <= 8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 4t => 4t >= 24 => t >= 6\n\nSo for t from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nt=6,7,8.\n\nNow, are there other cars? Only this one can have 0 in span.\n\nFirst and second cars are always positive, so 0 not in their spans.\n\nSo for freeway 7, 0 in span when t=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as freeway 7, so t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision possible at position 0:\n\nFreeway 1: t=2 (i.e., turn 96)\n\nFreeway 2: t=2\n\nFreeway 3: t=2\n\nFreeway 4: t=2\n\nFreeway 5: t=2\n\nFreeway 6: t=2\n\nFreeway 7: t=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: t=6,7,8\n\nt=0 is current turn, turn 94.\n\nAt turn 94, player is at y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since I start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, each U increases y by 1, so I need at least 9 up moves, but I can stay or go down, so H >= 9, but since I start at y=0, after H turns, I am at position after H actions.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t_1 =94, player is at (0, y_{94}) = (0,0)\n\nThen I choose action a_{94}, which determines y_{95} = y_{94} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after H turns, meaning after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I have y_{t_1 + H}\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's see:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nLet's parse the indices.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at y_{t_1} =0.\n\nI apply a_{t_1}, which moves to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1? No.\n\nThe state after action.\n\nTypically: at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose action a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the collision, at turn T, I am at y_T, and I check for collision on freeway y_T at that turn T.\n\nThen I choose a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, I need to have y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSet t_1 =94.\n\nI need y_{94 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAt turn 94 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nSince I start at turn 94, y=0, and after k actions, I am at turn 94 + k with y_{94+k}.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn 94 + H with y_{94+H}.\n\nBut I need y_{94 + H -1} =9, so at turn 94 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=94 to 94 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I have executed H steps, and I am at time 94 + H.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at time 94 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions from t=94, one action, then I need y_{94 +1 -1} = y_{94} =9, but y_{94}=0, not 9, so impossible for H=1.\n\nMinimal H: since I start at y=0, need to reach y=9, each U increases by 1, so minimal actions needed is 9 U, with no S or D, so H=9, and y_{94+8} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart: turn 94, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a94, at turn 95, y95 = y94 + Δy\n\nAfter second action, turn 96, y96, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 94 + k, y_{94+k}\n\nI need y_{94 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = 94 + H -1, so at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = 94 + H -1.\n\nSince I start at turn 94, y=0, to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe number of turns from start to end: from turn 94 to turn T, with y_T=9.\n\nThe number of actions taken: from a94 to aT, but actions are taken at turns 94 to T, and at turn T, I am at y_T, but I don't take action after that for reaching.\n\nThe sequence includes actions up to when I reach.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn 94 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, suppose I do nothing, at turn 94, y=0, not 9.\n\nAfter one action, at turn 95, y95, which could be 0,1, or -1 but y=0 min, so 0 or 1.\n\nIf y95=1, not 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of steps: since I need to increase y by 9, and each U increases by 1, I need at least 9 U actions.\n\nIf I do only U, I can reach in 9 actions: start turn 94 y=0, after a94=U, turn 95 y=1, ..., after a102=U, turn 103 y=9. Let's index.\n\nTurn 94: y=0\n\na94: U, turn 95: y=1\n\na95: U, turn 96: y=2\n\n...\n\nup to a102: U, turn 103: y=9\n\nNow, at which turn am I at y=9? Turn 103.\n\ny_{103} =9.\n\nNow, the turn I reach is 103.\n\nt_1 =94, so 103 = 94 + 9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a94 to a102, that's 9 actions? Turns 94 to 102 inclusive: 102-94+1=9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at turn 94+9=103, y=9.\n\nNow, I need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{94 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo 94 + H -1 =103? Then H-1=9, H=10.\n\n94 + H -1 =103, so 93 + H =103, H=10.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =94 + H -1\n\nSet equal to 103, so 94 + H -1 =103, so 93 + H =103, H=10.\n\nBut with 9 actions, I reach at turn 103.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_t for t=94 to 102}, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{94 + 9 -1} = y_{102}\n\nAt turn 102, after a102, I am at y102? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nI choose a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, turn 94: at y94=0\n\nChoose a94, then y95 = y94 + Δy\n\nAt turn 95, I am at y95.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 102: I choose a102, then y103 = y102 + Δy\n\nIf I want y103=9, I set a102 such that y103=9.\n\nBut at turn 102, I am at y102, which could be 8 or 9 or 10, but if I go U from 8, y103=9.\n\nThe point is that at turn T, I am at y_T, and I need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nIn the requirement, I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for T = t_1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn 103, T=103, so t_1 + H -1 =103, 94 + H -1=103, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=94 to t=94+10-1=103? t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns 94 to 94 + H -1.\n\nIf H=10, actions at 94 to 103.\n\nBut at turn 103, I am choosing a103, which would affect y104, but I don't care after that.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn 103, before choosing a103.\n\nAt turn 103, I am at y103, and if y103=9, I am already there, but I still need to specify a103? No.\n\nThe sequence includes actions up to when I reach, but since I reach at turn 103, I may not need to act at turn 103 if I am already at 9.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, I have H actions, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, but I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, to have y103=9, I need to arrive at turn 103.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =103, 94 + H -1=103, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=94 to 103, but at turn 103, I am at y103, which is 9, so I don't need to do anything, so a103 could be S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to specify H actions.\n\nMinimal H is when I go directly up as fast as possible.\n\nWith 9 U actions, I can be at y9 at turn 103, as above.\n\nWith H=9 actions, from a94 to a102, I reach y103=9.\n\nBut for H=9, t_1 + H -1 =94+9-1=102, so I need y102=9.\n\nAt turn 102, I am at y102, which could be 9 if I reached earlier, but with 9 U, at turn 102, y102=8 if I started from 0 and did 8 U.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nTurn 94: y94=0\n\nAfter a94: if U, y95=1\n\nAfter a95: U, y96=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a101: U, y102=8\n\nThen a102: U, y103=9\n\nSo at turn 102, y102=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y102=9, I need to reach earlier, but I start from 0, so impossible to be at y=9 at turn 102 with actions from 94 to 101 or something.\n\nActions from t=94 to t=94+H-1.\n\nFor H=9, actions at 94 to 102 (since t=0 to 8, turns 94+0 to 94+8=102)\n\nThen after these actions, at turn 94+H =103, y103.\n\nBut I need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y102 =9.\n\nWith the actions, at turn 102, y102=8, as above, not 9.\n\nTo have y102=9, I need to have done 9 U by turn 101 or something.\n\nStart turn 94 y=0\n\na94 U, turn 95 y=1\n\na95 U, turn 96 y=2\n\n...\na101 U, turn 102 y=8? From turn 95 to 102, that's 8 steps to go from y1 to y8, but at turn 102 y=8.\n\nTo have y102=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 102, which requires that at turn 101, y101=8 or 9, and I go U or S.\n\nIf y101=8, a101=U, y102=9\n\nOr y101=9, a101=S, y102=9\n\nBut to have y101=8 or 9, I need to have done at least 8 U by turn 101.\n\nTurn 101: after a101, y102.\n\ny101 is at turn 101.\n\nTo have y102=9, it depends on y101 and a101.\n\ny102 = y101 + Δa101\n\nSo to have y102=9, if y101=8, a101=U; if y101=9, a101=S or U or D but y102=9 only if a101=S or if y101=8 U or y101=10 D, but y<=9, so only from 8 or 9.\n\nMinimal, from y=0, to reach y=9 at turn T.\n\nThe earliest turn to be at y=9 is turn 103, with 9 U actions from 94 to 102.\n\nAt turn 103, y103=9.\n\nFor that, T=103, so t_1 + H -1 =103, 94 + H -1=103, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from 94 to 103.\n\nAt turn 103, I am at y103=9, so I can set a103=S, for example.\n\nWith H=10, I can be at y=9 at turn 103.\n\nIf I can reach earlier, but I can't, since min 9 steps to increase by 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 10, with y_{94+10-1}=y103=9.\n\nAnd actions include a103.\n\nBut in this case, for the car avoidance, I need to be careful not to be on freeways when cars are at 0.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 94, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways y=1 to 8 have dangerous times.\n\nFrom above, for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at t=2, turn 96\n\nSimilarly for 2,3,4,5,6 at t=2, turn 96\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at t=6,7,8, turns 100,101,102\n\nFreeway 8: same, turns 100,101,102\n\nt=6,7,8 from now, turn 94+6=100, 101,102.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach step I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nThe dangerous times are turn 96 for freeways 1-6, and turns 100,101,102 for freeways 7 and 8.\n\nSince freeways 1-6 are all dangerous only at turn 96, and freeways 7-8 at 100,101,102.\n\ny=1 to 8.\n\nIf I go directly up, starting from turn 94 y=0.\n\na94: U, to y=1 at turn 95.\n\nAt turn 95, on y=1, need to check if dangerous.\n\nFor y=1, dangerous only at turn 96? At turn 95, is it dangerous?\n\nFor freeway 1, dangerous at t=2, turn 96, so at turn 95, t=1, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways dangerous only at specific turns.\n\nAt turn 95, on y=1, freeway 1.\n\nWhen is freeway 1 dangerous? Only at turn 96, t=2.\n\nAt turn 95, t=1, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to y=2 at turn 96.\n\nBut at turn 96, on y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 dangerous at turn 96, so collision!\n\nSimilarly, if I go up directly:\n\nTurn 94: y=0, safe\n\na94: U, turn 95: y=1, on freeway 1. At turn 95, t=1, freeway 1 not dangerous (only t=2), so safe.\n\na95: U, turn 96: y=2, on freeway 2. At turn 96, t=2, freeway 2 dangerous, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeways 1-6 at turn 96.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 7-8, dangerous at turns 100,101,102.\n\nNow, since I need to go through all freeways, I have to be on each y=1 to 8 at some point.\n\nI can delay or advance when I am on each row to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFor freeways 1-6, dangerous only at turn 96, so I should not be on any of them at turn 96.\n\nThat means at turn 96, I should not be on y=1,2,3,4,5, or 6.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I could be on y=0 or y=9 at turn 96.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, I might not be there yet.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 7 and 8, dangerous at turns 100,101,102, so I should not be on y=7 or y=8 at those turns.\n\nNow, turn 96 is critical for y=1-6.\n\nI start at turn 94, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nOne way is to be on a safe row at turn 96.\n\nSafe rows at turn 96 are y=0,7,8,9? y=0 and y=9 are safe, but y=7 and y=8 are freeways, but at turn 96, are they dangerous?\n\nFor freeway 7, dangerous at t=6,7,8, turn 100,101,102.\n\nAt turn 96, t=2, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 not dangerous.\n\nSo at turn 96, y=1-6 are dangerous, y=0,7,8,9 are safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe, y=7 and y=8 are safe at turn 96 since not dangerous times.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, I need to check.\n\nBut for now, at turn 96, I should be on y=0,7,8, or9.\n\nSince I start from y=0, and need to go up, being on y=0 at turn 96 might mean I stayed or went down, which is inefficient.\n\nBeing on y=7 or 8 at turn 96 might be possible if I move fast.\n\nTurn 94 to turn 96 is 2 steps: from turn 94 to 95 and 95 to 96.\n\nStart turn 94 y=0.\n\nAfter two actions, at turn 96, y96.\n\nPossible to reach y=2 with two U, but y=2 dangerous at turn 96.\n\ny=0: if I do S or D, but D to y=-1 not allowed, so only S, y=0.\n\ny=1: with one U and one S, or something.\n\nWith two actions, from y=0, possible y96: 0,1,2.\n\ny=0: by doing S,S or S,D not possible, only S,S or U then D, but D from y=1 to y=0, possible.\n\ny=0: stay at 0, or go to 1 and back to 0.\n\ny=1: go to 1 and stay, or go to 0 then to 1? From y=0, a94: S, y95=0; then a95: U, y96=1\n\nOr a94: U, y95=1; a95: S, y96=1\n\nOr a94: U, y95=1; a95: D, y96=0\n\ny=2: a94: U, y95=1; a95: U, y96=2\n\nSo at turn 96, possible y=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are dangerous at turn 96, since on freeway 1 or 2, etc.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nBut if I am at y=0 at turn 96, I am behind.\n\nThen I need to go up to y=9, which takes at least 9 more steps, to reach at turn 105 or later, which might not be minimal.\n\nI could be at y=7 or 8 at turn 96.\n\nBut from y=0 at turn 94 to y=7 or 8 at turn 96, that is 2 steps to gain 7 or 8, impossible, max gain 2, so y<=2.\n\nSo at turn 96, I can only be at y=0,1,2.\n\ny=1 and 2 are dangerous, so only safe is y=0 at turn 96.\n\nThus, I must be at y=0 at turn 96.\n\nThat means I do not move up at the first two turns.\n\nFor example: at turn 94, a94=S, y95=0\n\nturn 95, a95=S, y96=0\n\nThen at turn 96, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut I have freeways 7 and 8 dangerous at turns 100,101,102.\n\nturns 100,101,102.\n\nNow, turn 96, y=0.\n\nI can start moving up.\n\nEach step up increases y by 1.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at turns 100,101,102.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are dangerous at those times.\n\nAlso, other freeways are safe except at turn 96, which has passed.\n\nFor freeways 1-6, dangerous only at turn 96, so after that, no danger.\n\nOnly freeways 7 and 8 have danger at t=6,7,8, turns 100,101,102.\n\nNow, from turn 96, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut I have to go through y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, turns: let me list the turns from turn 96 onwards.\n\nSet turn 96 as time 0 for simplicity, but I'll keep absolute turns.\n\nTurn 96: y=0\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nTarget to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nMinimal turns from here: 9 up actions to reach turn 105 y=9.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at turns 100,101,102.\n\nTurns 100,101,102 relative to turn 96.\n\nTurn 96 is current, then turn 97,98,etc.\n\nTurn 100 = turn 96 +4\n\nTurn 101 = 96+5\n\nTurn 102=96+6\n\nAt turn 100, which is in 4 steps from turn 96.\n\nAt turn 96, y=0.\n\nAfter k steps, at turn 96+k, y_{96+k}\n\ny_{96} =0\n\nAfter a96, y97 = y96 + Δa = 0 + Δa\n\nAfter a97, y98, and so on.\n\ny at turn T: y_T.\n\nAt turn 100, y100\n\nIf I am on y=7 or 8 at turn 100, and freeway 7 or 8 dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly for 101 and 102.\n\nTo avoid, I should not be on y=7 or y=8 at turns 100,101,102.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are both dangerous at those times.\n\nI could be on other rows.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns are 100,101,102 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nI need to schedule when I am on each row.\n\nFor example, I can pass through y=7 and y=8 before or after these turns.\n\nFrom turn 96, y=0.\n\nI can go up as fast as possible, but skip the dangerous times for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince the danger is for specific rows at specific times, I can be on other rows at those times.\n\nFor instance, at turn 100, if I am not on y=7 or 8, safe.\n\nSimilarly for 101,102.\n\nNow, let me find a path.\n\nStart from turn 96 y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal time: if no cars, I can do U each turn: turn 97 y=1, 98 y=2, ..., up to turn 105 y=9.\n\nBut at turn 100: y=4 (since from turn 96 y=0, after 4 steps: turn 97 y=1, 98 y=2, 99 y=3, 100 y=4)\n\nAt turn 101: y=5\n\nTurn 102: y=6\n\nTurn 103: y=7\n\nTurn 104: y=8\n\nTurn 105: y=9\n\nNow, dangerous turns for y=7 and 8: turns 100,101,102.\n\nBut at turn 100, y=4, not 7 or 8.\n\nTurn 101, y=5, not 7 or 8.\n\nTurn 102, y=6, not 7 or 8.\n\nThen at turn 103, y=7, but turn 103 is not dangerous, only 100,101,102 dangerous for y=7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at t=6,7,8 which is turns 100,101,102.\n\nAt turn 103, t=9, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 103, y=7, freeway 7, but turn 103, t=9, not dangerous, since dangerous only at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 from t_1=94, turn 100,101,102.\n\nTurn 103 is safe for all.\n\nSimilarly, turn 104 y=8, freeway 8, turn 104, t=10? t= T -94, T=104, t=10, not 6,7,8, so safe.\n\nThen turn 105 y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, I am never on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nAt turn 100, y=4, freeway 4, but freeway 4 dangerous only at turn 96, which passed, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nOnly issue was at turn 96, which we avoided by staying at y=0.\n\nIn this sequence from turn 96 onwards:\n\nTurn 96: y=0\n\na96: U, turn 97: y=1\n\na97: U, turn 98: y=2\n\na98: U, turn 99: y=3\n\na99: U, turn 100: y=4\n\na100: U, turn 101: y=5\n\na101: U, turn 102: y=6\n\na102: U, turn 103: y=7\n\na103: U, turn 104: y=8\n\na104: U, turn 105: y=9\n\nNow, at turn 100: y=4, freeway 4, not dangerous at turn 100.\n\nTurn 101: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nTurn 102: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nTurn 103: y=7, freeway 7, but turn 103, t=103-94=9, not in {6,7,8}, so safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 104: y=8, freeway 8, t=10, safe.\n\nTurn 105: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd we were safe at turn 96 by being at y=0.\n\nNow, back to the beginning.\n\nAt turn 94, we need to specify actions.\n\nFrom turn 94 to turn 95 and 96, we stayed.\n\nTurn 94: a94=S, y95=0\n\nTurn 95: a95=S, y96=0\n\nThen from above, a96=U, y97=1\n\na97=U, y98=2\n\n...\n\nup to a104=U, y105=9\n\nNow, at turn 105, y=9, which is what we need.\n\nNow, the turn we reach y=9 is turn 105.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =105\n\nt_1=94, so 94 + H -1 =105, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from t=94 to t=94 + H -1 =94+11=105? Let's see.\n\nH=12, actions for t from 0 to 11, turns 94+0 to 94+11=105.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{94+12-1} = y_{105} =9, yes.\n\nNumber of actions: 12.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nEarlier I thought minimal H is 10 to reach at turn 103, but with the car at turn 96, I had to delay, so I reached at turn 105.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach faster.\n\nFor example, if I don't stay at the beginning, but I must avoid turn 96 on freeways.\n\nAt turn 96, I must be at y=0, as we concluded.\n\nThen from there, I go up directly, reaching y=9 at turn 105.\n\nCan I be faster?\n\nFor example, from turn 96 y=0, to reach y=9 in fewer than 9 steps? No, need 9 U.\n\nMinimal 9 steps to go from 0 to 9.\n\nTurn 96 to turn 105 is 9 steps: actions at 96 to 104, reach turn 105.\n\nIn terms of turns, from turn 96 to turn 105, 10 turns? Turn 96 to turn 105 inclusive is 10 turns, but actions from turn 96 to 104, 9 actions.\n\nTurn 96: after a96, y97=1, ..., after a104, y105=9.\n\nSo 9 actions from turn 96 to 104.\n\nBut at the beginning, we had two actions: turn 94 and 95, both S, to stay at y=0.\n\nThen actions from 96 to 104.\n\nTotal actions: turn 94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104? That's 11 actions? Let's list.\n\nActions: a94, a95, a96, a97, a98, a99, a100, a101, a102, a103, a104\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nTurns: actions at 94 to 104 inclusive: 104-94+1=11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at turn 105, y=9.\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{94 + H -1}\n\nSet to 105, so 94 + H -1 =105, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nH=12 actions: from a94 to a105? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =105, 94 + H -1=105, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions at turns 94 to 94 + 11 = 105? t from 0 to H-1=11, turns 94 to 94+11=105.\n\nYes, actions at 94 to 105.\n\nAt turn 105, I am at y105, which is 9, so I can set a105=S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a94 to a104, I have 11 actions, but for H=12, I need 12 actions, so I can add a105=S.\n\nBut I already reach at turn 105, so a105 can be S.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with 11 actions I reach at turn 105, but for the requirement, I need to specify until y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is turn 105, so H=12 with actions including a105.\n\nBut minimal H: since I must be at y=0 at turn 96, and from there min 9 actions to y=9 at turn 105, so total min 11 actions to reach turn 105, but with H=12 to satisfy the index.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I go faster before or after.\n\nBut at turn 96, I must be at y=0, so I can't reach before turn 105.\n\nTurn 105 is the earliest possible to be at y=9, given that I was at y=0 at turn 96.\n\nIs that true?\n\nFrom turn 94 to 96, I stay at y=0, so I lose two turns.\n\nThen from turn 96 to 105, 9 turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut turn 105 is t_1 + 11, since t_1=94, turn 105=94+11.\n\ny_{94+11} =105.\n\nNow for the freeways 7 and 8, in the path I took, I was on y=7 at turn 103, which is safe, and y=8 at turn 104, safe.\n\nBut I have to make sure about the car on freeway 7 and 8 at other times.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the delay by not being on the critical rows.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 96, instead of being at y=0, can I be at y=7 or 8? But as before, impossible in two steps.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go down or something, but not helpful.\n\nSo the minimal H should be 12.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, for the freeways 7 and 8, the dangerous times are turns 100,101,102.\n\nIn my path, at those turns, I am on y=4,5,6, which are not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nAnd freeways 4,5,6 are only dangerous at turn 96, which passed.\n\nNow, about freeway 7 and 8 cars: they are dangerous only at t=6,7,8, turns 100,101,102, so at other times safe.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nStart turn 94: y=0\n\na94: S, so y95=0\n\nturn 95: a95: S, y96=0\n\nturn 96: a96: U, y97=1\n\nturn 97: a97: U, y98=2\n\nturn 98: a98: U, y99=3\n\nturn 99: a99: U, y100=4\n\nturn 100: a100: U, y101=5\n\nturn 101: a101: U, y102=6\n\nturn 102: a102: U, y103=7\n\nturn 103: a103: U, y104=8\n\nturn 104: a104: U, y105=9\n\nNow, at turn 105, y=9, but I need to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is turn 105 for H=12? t_1 + H -1=94 + H -1\n\nSet to 105, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut in the sequence above, actions from a94 to a104, that's 11 actions, and y105=9.\n\nFor H=12, I need 12 actions, up to a105.\n\nSo I can add a105: S, for example, since already at y=9.\n\nThen y106=9, but I don't care.\n\nThe requirement is to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is 105, so with a105, I am specifying action at turn 105, but at turn 105 I am already at y=9, so a105 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, with a105=S, y106=9, but I need y105=9, which is satisfied.\n\nIn the action list, I have actions for turns 94 to 105.\n\nNow, to minimize H, is there a way with H=11?\n\nH=11, then t_1 + H -1 =94 +11 -1=104.\n\nSo I need y104=9.\n\nBut from above, with the car constraint, I must be at y=0 at turn 96.\n\nThen from turn 96 to turn 104, that is 8 actions.\n\nAfter 8 actions from turn 96, at turn 104, y104.\n\nFrom y=0, after 8 U, y104=8? Turn 96: y=0\n\na96: U, y97=1\n\n...\n\na103: U, y104=8\n\nThen at turn 104, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y104=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 104, which requires that at turn 103, y103=8 or 9, and a103=U or S.\n\nBut from turn 96 y=0, to have y103=8 or 9.\n\nWith 7 actions: from a96 to a102, y103.\n\ny103 = after 7 actions from y=0, max y=7 if all U.\n\ny103=7.\n\nThen a103=U, y104=8, not 9.\n\nIf I can be faster, but I start from y=0 at turn 96, so earliest y=9 at turn 105.\n\nThus, impossible to reach before turn 105.\n\nTherefore, minimal to reach at turn 105, with H=12 for the action sequence.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nNow, about freeways 7 and 8: in the path, I pass y=7 at turn 103 and y=8 at turn 104, both safe.\n\nBut at turn 103, t=103-94=9, not dangerous, similarly turn 104 t=10.\n\nDangerous at t=6,7,8 turns 100,101,102.\n\nAt turn 102, I am at y=6, which is freeway 6, not dangerous at that time.\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous only at turn 96.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, the sequence should include a105.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to list actions from turn t_1=94.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 94: S\n\nTurn 95: S\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nAnd for turn 105: since I need H=12, and action at turn 105, I can set a105: S\n\nThen y106=9, but I don't care, since I reached at turn 105.\n\nIn the sequence, with a105=S, it is fine.\n\nTo save an action, but I can't, since minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving earlier, but at turn 96 I must be at y=0.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 94, I could go up to y=1 at turn 95, but then at turn 96 I need to be at y=0, so I have to go down at turn 95 or something.\n\nFor example: turn 94: a94=U, y95=1\n\nThen turn 95: a95=D, y96=0\n\nThen same as before, I am at y=0 at turn 96.\n\nBut I used two actions: U and D, to end at same position, but I moved to y=1 and back, which might not help, and I was on y=1 at turn 95, which is safe, since freeway 1 not dangerous at t=1.\n\nBut then I have to go up from turn 96, same as before.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at turn 105 still.\n\nWith a94=U and a95=D, I have extra movement but same position at turn 96.\n\nThen actions a96 to a104 U, y105=9, same.\n\nBut now I have 11 actions to reach turn 105, but with H=12, I need to add a105.\n\nIn terms of number, it's the same H.\n\nIn this case, with a94=U, a95=D, then a96 to a104 U, that's 10 actions? a94 to a104 is 11 actions, reach y105=9.\n\nThen for H=12, add a105=S.\n\nBut with the first way, a94=S, a95=S, a96 to a104 U, 11 actions, same.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about freeway 7 and 8: I think it's ok.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I am on a dangerous row.\n\nFor example, at turn 100: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous only at turn 96, t=2, now turn 100 t=6, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, turn 101 y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nTurn 102 y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nTurn 103 y=7, freeway 7, t=103-94=9, not in {6,7,8}, so safe.\n\nTurn 104 y=8, freeway 8, t=10, safe.\n\nAnd earlier turns no issue.\n\nAlso, at turn 95: if I do S or in the alternative, if I go up and down, at turn 95 y=1, freeway 1, t=1, not dangerous.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 94: S\n\nTurn 95: S\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: S  (since at y=9, I stay, but I could do anything, but S is fine)\n\nIn the sequence, turn 105: S, but after that y106=9, but we don't care.\n\nThe action at turn 105 is part of the sequence to reach, but since I am already at y=9, it doesn't move.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can set a105 to U or D, but y would change, but I don't need to, since I reached at turn 105.\n\nThe requirement is to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is 105, with y105=9.\n\nWith a105, I am specifying action at turn 105, which affects y106, but y105 is already 9 before action a105.\n\nAt turn 105, I am at y105=9, then I choose a105, which would set y106.\n\nBut for the position at turn 105, it is already 9, so I have reached.\n\nIn the action sequence, including a105 is fine, and I can set it to S.\n\nTo have exactly H=12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 94 to 105, that's 12 turns, actions at each.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have turn 104: U to y105=9, then turn 105: S.\n\nBut I can list.\n\nNow, about the cars: I think I covered.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but I only care when 0 is in span, which I have the times.\n\nIn freeway 7, at t=6,7,8, but other times safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by avoiding the freeway 7 and 8 danger differently, but since the danger is at turns 100,101,102, and I am on lower rows, it's fine.\n\nIf I go slower, I might take more turns, worse.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 94: S\n\nTurn 95: S\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=94.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 94: a_{94} = S\n\nTurn 95: a_{95} = S\n\nTurn 96: a_{96} = U\n\nTurn 97: a_{97} = U\n\nTurn 98: a_{98} = U\n\nTurn 99: a_{99} = U\n\nTurn 100: a_{100} = U\n\nTurn 101: a_{101} = U\n\nTurn 102: a_{102} = U\n\nTurn 103: a_{103} = U\n\nTurn 104: a_{104} = U\n\nTurn 105: a_{105} = S\n\nAnd H=12.\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut turn 105 is t_1 + 11, since t_1=94, 94+11=105.\n\nt from 0 to 11 for H=12.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the minimal.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 94\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collisions occur if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Dangerous Turns\n- The dangerous times for each freeway are derived from the car positions at \\(t_1 = 94\\) and their movement rules.\n- Freeways 1 to 6 are dangerous only at turn 96 (relative time \\(t = 2\\).\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are dangerous at turns 100, 101, and 102 (relative times \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n- To avoid collision at turn 96, the player must not be on freeways 1 to 6 (i.e., \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\)) at that turn. The only safe positions at turn 96 are \\(y = 0\\), \\(y = 7\\), \\(y = 8\\), or \\(y = 9\\). However, starting from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 94, it is impossible to reach \\(y = 7\\) or higher by turn 96 in two steps (maximum reach is \\(y = 2\\)). Thus, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 96.\n- This requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 94 and 95, using actions \\(S\\) (stay) for both turns.\n- From turn 96 onwards, the player moves up (\\(U\\)) as quickly as possible to reach \\(y = 9\\). The path must avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 100, 101, and 102.\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) Safely\n- Start at turn 94: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 95: Stay at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- Turn 96: Move to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe as turn 96 is not dangerous for freeway 1 at relative time \\(t = 0\\) from turn 96, but absolute turn 96 corresponds to \\(t = 2\\) from \\(t_1 = 94\\); freeway 1 is dangerous only at turn 96, but the player is on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 96, which is dangerous. Correction: at turn 96, \\(y = 1\\) is on freeway 1, which is dangerous at turn 96. Therefore, the player must not be on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 96. The only safe option is \\(y = 0\\) at turn 96, which is achieved by staying at turns 94 and 95.\n- After turn 96, the player moves up:\n  - Turn 97: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe as dangerous turn 96 has passed).\n  - Turn 98: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe).\n  - Turn 99: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe).\n  - Turn 100: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe; not on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\), so avoids danger on freeways 7 and 8).\n  - Turn 101: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe; not on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\)).\n  - Turn 102: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe; not on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\)).\n  - Turn 103: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe as turn 103 is not dangerous for freeway 7).\n  - Turn 104: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe as turn 104 is not dangerous for freeway 8).\n  - Turn 105: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, not a freeway; goal reached).\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\)\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 105.\n- The turn index for reaching is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 105\\), so \\(94 + H - 1 = 105\\), giving \\(H - 1 = 11\\) and \\(H = 12\\).\n- The sequence has 12 actions from turn 94 to turn 105, with \\(y_{105} = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 94: \\(S\\) (stay to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for safety at turn 96).\n- Turn 95: \\(S\\) (stay to remain at \\(y = 0\\)).\n- Turn 96: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 1\\)).\n- Turn 97: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\)).\n- Turn 98: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\)).\n- Turn 99: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\)).\n- Turn 100: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\); safe as not on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at dangerous turns).\n- Turn 101: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\); safe).\n- Turn 102: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\); now at turn 102, \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous for freeway 7? Turn 102 is dangerous for freeway 7, but at turn 102, the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (after action), not \\(y = 7\\). At turn 102, the player chooses action \\(U\\), moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 103. At turn 102, the player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is safe. The collision check is at the current turn for the current row. At turn 102, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6) is safe, and freeways 7 and 8 are dangerous, but the player is not on them.\n- Turn 103: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\); at turn 103, \\(y = 7\\) is safe, as turn 103 is not dangerous).\n- Turn 104: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\); at turn 104, \\(y = 8\\) is safe).\n- Turn 105: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\); action required for \\(H = 12\\), but position is already reached).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 105 with \\(H = 12\\), the minimal possible due to the constraint of being at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 96.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 94: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 101: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 102: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 103: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 104: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 105: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 96, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is updated as:\n  y_{t+1} = y_t + 1 (if U)\n  y_{t+1} = y_t - 1 (if D)\n  y_{t+1} = y_t (if S)\n\nBut note: the grid has y in [0,9]. We start at y=0 and need to get to y=9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at y = k (where k is between 1 and 8, the freeways), then we check the car(s) on freeway k at that turn. Collision occurs if 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: when moving from y to y' at turn T, note:\n  - At turn T, the player is at y (the starting freeway) and we check for collision on freeway y at turn T.\n  - Then we move to y' at the next turn (so at turn T+1, we are at y').\n\nSo if we are at freeway k at turn T, we only worry about the cars on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=96.\n\nFor each freeway, we have one or more cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\nFor left-moving: the car moves left, so at time t1, the span is [h, τ] (with h > τ, because as the car moves left, the head decreases). Then at time T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nFor right-moving: the car moves right, so at time t1, the span is [τ, h] (with τ < h). Then at time T, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the given cars are all right-moving? Actually, the direction is given as \"right\". So all cars are right-moving.\n\nIn the given state:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> but wait, for right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? Here, -48 > -83, so the head is -48 and tail is -83? But in the representation for right-moving, they wrote \"head\" and \"tail\" but then in the update for right-moving, they use [τ, h] and then update to [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So if the car is right-moving, then the head is the front (which is the larger number) and the tail is the back (the smaller number). However, in the given data, for freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-83. But -48 is greater than -83? So actually, the head is at -48 and the tail at -83, meaning the car extends from -83 to -48 (so the front is at -48 and the back at -83). This is consistent: the front is at a larger x-coordinate. So for right-moving, the car moves to the right, so at time T, the entire car is shifted to the right.\n\nSo for a right-moving car at t1: the span is [tail, head] = [-83, -48] (because tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost). Then at time T, the span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut note: freeways 7 and 8 have three cars each.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (>= t1) whether if the player is on that freeway at turn T, then 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nOur plan: we want to go from y=0 to y=9. We can only change by at most 1 per turn. So minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 9 (if we go up every turn: 0->1->...->9). But we have to avoid the freeways when a car is at x=0.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving. We need to compute the position of the cars at any future turn T (relative to t1=96).\n\nLet dt = T - 96.\n\nFor a car with initial head h0, tail t0, speed s, and direction right, at time T, the car's span is:\n  [ t0 + s*dt, h0 + s*dt ]\n\nWe are only concerned when the player is on the same freeway as the car at turn T.\n\nWe are going to try to find a path from y=0 at turn 96 to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn, the minimal H is at least 9. But we might have to wait (use S or even D) to avoid collisions, so H might be more.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway and each future time whether the freeway is blocked at x=0.\n\nLet's compute the time intervals during which each freeway is blocked at x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, the freeway is blocked at time T if 0 is in the interval [t0 + s*dt, h0 + s*dt] (for right-moving).\n\nSo we need:\n  t0 + s*dt <= 0 <= h0 + s*dt\n\nSolve for dt:\n\n  t0 + s*dt <= 0  => dt >= -t0/s\n  h0 + s*dt >= 0  => dt >= -h0/s   [but note: h0 is the head and is larger than t0, so -h0/s is more negative? Actually, we need to rearrange the inequalities correctly]\n\nActually, the condition is:\n  t0 + s*dt <= 0 <= h0 + s*dt\n\nThis breaks into two:\n  1) t0 + s*dt <= 0  => s*dt <= -t0  => dt <= -t0/s   [if s>0, which it is]\n  2) 0 <= h0 + s*dt  => s*dt >= -h0  => dt >= -h0/s\n\nBut note: since h0 > t0, then -h0/s < -t0/s (because h0>t0 and s>0, so -h0 < -t0). Therefore, the interval for dt is:\n  dt in [ ceil( (-h0)/s ), floor( (-t0)/s ) ]   ??? Let me be careful.\n\nActually, we have:\n  dt >= -h0/s   and   dt <= -t0/s\n\nBut note: because h0 is the head (larger) and t0 the tail (smaller), then -h0/s is less than -t0/s (since h0>t0, so -h0 < -t0, and dividing by positive s, same inequality).\n\nSo the condition is:\n  -h0/s <= dt <= -t0/s\n\nBut note: dt must be integer because turns are integers.\n\nTherefore, the freeway is blocked by this car for dt in the interval [ceil(-h0/s), floor(-t0/s)]? Actually, we need to be cautious.\n\nExample: if -h0/s = 1.2 and -t0/s = 3.7, then dt must be integer in [2,3] (since ceil(1.2)=2, floor(3.7)=3).\n\nBut note: the condition is dt must satisfy:\n  t0 + s*dt <= 0 <= h0 + s*dt\n\nSo we can compute:\n\n  dt_min = ceil( (-h0) / s )   ? Not exactly.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n  h0 + s*dt >= 0  => dt >= -h0/s   -> so the smallest integer dt satisfying this is ceil(-h0/s)\n\n  t0 + s*dt <= 0  => dt <= -t0/s   -> the largest integer dt satisfying this is floor(-t0/s)\n\nTherefore, the car blocks the freeway for dt from:\n  dt_low = ceil( (-h0) / s )   to   dt_high = floor( (-t0) / s )\n\nBut note: if the car is moving right, and the initial head is negative and tail is negative, then as dt increases, the car moves to the right. So eventually, if the car is to the left of 0 initially, it will pass 0.\n\nLet me verify with freeway 1:\n\nCar: h0 = -48, t0 = -83, s=36.\n\nThen:\n  dt_low = ceil( -(-48) / 36 ) = ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3)= ceil(1.333) = 2\n  dt_high = floor( -(-83)/36 ) = floor(83/36) = floor(2.3055) = 2\n\nSo only at dt=2? That is at turn T=96+2=98.\n\nCheck: at dt=2:\n  head = -48 + 36*2 = -48 + 72 = 24\n  tail = -83 + 36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n  So the car spans from -11 to 24. Then 0 is between -11 and 24 -> blocked.\n\nAt dt=1: \n  head = -48+36= -12\n  tail = -83+36= -47\n  Then 0 is not between -47 and -12? (since -47<=0<=-12? but 0 is not <= -12 -> false) -> not blocked.\n\nAt dt=3: \n  head = -48+108=60\n  tail = -83+108=25\n  Then 0 is not between 25 and 60 -> not blocked.\n\nSo indeed only at dt=2.\n\nBut wait, what about dt=0? \n  head=-48, tail=-83 -> 0 is not in [-83,-48]? because -83<=0<=-48 -> 0 is not <= -48 -> false. So not blocked.\n\nSo freeway 1 is blocked only at T=98.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3: same car, same blocking at T=98.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48, -71, right, 24)\nh0=-48, t0=-71, s=24.\n\ndt_low = ceil(48/24)=ceil(2)=2\ndt_high = floor(71/24)=floor(2.958)=2\n\nSo only at dt=2 -> T=98.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5,6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nCar1: (48, 37, right, 4) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? That means the car is from 37 to 48? Then it is already to the right of 0? And moving right, so it will never cover 0? \n\nCheck: condition: \n  dt_low = ceil( (-48)/4 ) = ceil(-12) = -12 -> but negative? We are only concerned for T>=96 (dt>=0). \n  dt_high = floor( (-37)/4 ) = floor(-9.25) = -10 -> also negative.\n\nSo for dt>=0, we need to check: \n  We have: \n    head + s*dt = 48+4*dt\n    tail + s*dt = 37+4*dt\n\n  The condition: 37+4*dt <= 0 <= 48+4*dt -> \n    First: 37+4*dt<=0 -> dt<=-37/4 -> dt<=-9.25 -> impossible for dt>=0.\n    Second: 0<=48+4*dt -> always true for dt>=0.\n\n  So the first inequality fails. So this car never blocks.\n\nCar2: (12,1,right,4)\n  head=12, tail=1, s=4.\n  Condition: 1+4*dt <=0 <=12+4*dt\n    First: 1+4*dt<=0 -> dt<=-1/4 -> false for dt>=0.\n  So never blocks.\n\nCar3: (-24,-35,right,4)\n  head=-24, tail=-35, s=4.\n  Condition: \n    tail + s*dt = -35+4*dt <=0 -> 4*dt<=35 -> dt<=35/4=8.75 -> dt<=8\n    head + s*dt = -24+4*dt>=0 -> 4*dt>=24 -> dt>=6\n\n  So dt must be integer between 6 and 8 inclusive.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 7 is blocked at dt=6,7,8 -> turns 96+6=102, 103, 104.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same three cars -> same blocking at turns 102,103,104.\n\nSo summary of blocked freeways at turns (relative to turn 96):\n\nFreeways 1,2,3,4,5,6: blocked only at turn 98 (dt=2).\nFreeways 7,8: blocked at turns 102,103,104 (dt=6,7,8).\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn 96.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nWe have to avoid being on freeway k at turn T if that freeway is blocked at turn T.\n\nWe can plan a path:\n\nWe are at y=0 at turn 96.\n\nAt turn 96: we are at y=0. We are not on any freeway (freeways are 1-8, and we are at y=0 which is not a freeway). So we are safe.\n\nWe can choose to move up (to y=1 at turn97) or stay or down (but down would go to y=-1? but y must be in [0,9] -> so we cannot go below 0. So at y=0, we cannot go down. So we can only do U or S.\n\nBut note: the rules say: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go down from 0, we would get -1 -> but then it must be clamped? The problem does not specify clamping. But the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So I think we are not allowed to go below 0. Therefore, at y=0, D is invalid? Or does the game force it to 0? The problem says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So if we choose D at y=0, then we would get y_{t+1}=0? Similarly, at y=9, U would be 10 -> then set to 9? Or the move is not allowed? The problem does not specify. But note the update: it says \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", and then \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So I think it is allowed to try to go beyond, but then it gets clamped. However, the problem does not explicitly say. But to be safe, we should avoid moves that would take us out of bounds? But note: the problem says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so we can assume that if the move would take us out, then we stay at the boundary.\n\nBut to minimize the number of moves, we probably don't want to go down from 0 because that would leave us at 0 and waste a move. Similarly, at the top, we want to avoid going above 9.\n\nSo at turn96: we are at y=0. We can:\n  Option1: U -> then at turn97, we are at y=1.\n  Option2: S -> then at turn97, we are still at y=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. So we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid:\n\n- At turn98 (dt=2): freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6 are blocked. That is, if we are on freeway 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 at turn98, we crash.\n\nWe are at turn96: y=0.\n\nTurn97: we can be at y=0 (if we stayed) or y=1 (if we went up).\n\nTurn98: \n  If we went up at turn96, then at turn97 we are at y=1. Then at turn98, we can choose to go up to y=2, down to y=0, or stay at y=1.\n  But if we are at y=1 at turn98, then we are on freeway1 -> which is blocked -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=1 at turn98.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at y=2,3,4,5,6 at turn98 because they are blocked.\n\nSo at turn98, we must not be on freeways 1-6. That means we must be either at y=0, or y=7,8,9.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at turn96. In two moves (turn96 and turn97) we can get to at most y=2.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=7,8,9 by turn98.\n\nTherefore, the only safe place at turn98 is y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn98.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nAt turn96: we start at y=0.\n  If we do S at turn96: then at turn97 we are at y=0.\n  Then at turn97: we must do S again? Because if we do U at turn97, then at turn98 we would be at y=1 -> crash. If we do D, we cannot (we are at 0, so D would leave us at 0? So we can do S or D (but D would be same as S at 0) -> so we do S at turn97, then at turn98 we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nAlternatively, if we had done U at turn96, then at turn97 we are at y=1. Then at turn97 we must go down to y=0 (so D) to be at y=0 at turn98. But that would be: \n  turn96: U -> y=1 at turn97.\n  turn97: D -> y=0 at turn98.\n\nBut that also works.\n\nHowever, we want the minimal number of turns. Both ways we are at y=0 at turn98. Then we have to go from y=0 to y=9. That will take at least 9 moves. But we have already used 2 moves to stay at 0? So total moves would be 2 (to stay at 0) + 9 (to go from 0 to 9) = 11? \n\nBut wait: we are at turn98 (which is two turns after start: turns 96 and 97) and we are at y=0. Then we need to go from y=0 to y=9: that takes 9 moves (if we go up 9 times). So the total turns would be 2 (for the first two) plus 9 moves = 11 turns? And the last move would be at turn96+10 (because we count from t=0 to H-1). Let me clarify:\n\nWe are at turn96: t=0 (relative to the sequence: we are at the start of the sequence).\nAt the end of H turns, we are at turn96 + H - 1.\n\nWe start at turn96: that's the first state (before any action? Actually, the problem says: we are at turn t1=96, and we are to give actions for t1, t1+1, ... until the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nSo we start at (0,0) at turn96. Then we take an action at turn96, which leads to a new state at turn97.\n\nWe must be at y=9 at the end of some turn T (which is turn96 + H - 1).\n\nSo if we take 11 actions (H=11), then the last state is at turn96+10.\n\nNow, we have to avoid the other blocks: freeways 7 and 8 are blocked at turns102,103,104 (which are dt=6,7,8 relative to 96, so turns 96+6=102, 103, 104).\n\nNote: \n  turn96: dt=0\n  turn97: dt=1\n  turn98: dt=2\n  turn99: dt=3\n  turn100: dt=4\n  turn101: dt=5\n  turn102: dt=6\n  turn103: dt=7\n  turn104: dt=8\n\nWe are at turn98 (dt=2) at y=0.\n\nWe now need to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal time is 9 moves: so we would be at:\n\n  turn99: y=1\n  turn100: y=2\n  turn101: y=3\n  turn102: y=4\n  turn103: y=5\n  turn104: y=6\n  turn105: y=7\n  turn106: y=8\n  turn107: y=9\n\nBut at turn102, we are at y=4 -> freeway4? But freeway4 is only blocked at turn98? Not at turn102. Similarly, freeway7 and8 are blocked at turns102,103,104.\n\nAt turn102: we are at y=4 -> freeway4 is safe? But we must avoid freeway7 and8 at that time? We are on freeway4, so we don't care about freeway7 and8. Only when we are on freeway7 or8 at turn102, we crash.\n\nBut at turn102, we are at y=4 -> freeway4, which is safe at turn102.\n\nHowever, at turn103: we are at y=5 -> freeway5 -> safe (freeway5 blocked only at turn98).\n\nAt turn104: we are at y=6 -> freeway6 -> safe (only blocked at turn98).\n\nThen at turn105: y=7 -> freeway7. But turn105 is dt=9? And freeway7 is blocked only at dt=6,7,8 (turns102,103,104). So at turn105, freeway7 is not blocked. Similarly, freeway8 is not blocked.\n\nSo we can go straight up from turn98 to turn107? \n\nBut wait, we are at turn98: y=0.\n\nWe then do:\n\n  turn98: U -> y=1 (at turn99)\n  turn99: U -> y=2 (at turn100)\n  turn100: U -> y=3 (at turn101)\n  turn101: U -> y=4 (at turn102) -> safe (freeway4 not blocked at turn102)\n  turn102: U -> y=5 (at turn103) -> safe (freeway5 not blocked at turn103)\n  turn103: U -> y=6 (at turn104) -> safe (freeway6 not blocked at turn104)\n  turn104: U -> y=7 (at turn105) -> freeway7: at turn105, dt=9 -> not blocked (because block only at 102,103,104) -> safe\n  turn105: U -> y=8 (at turn106) -> freeway8: at turn106, dt=10 -> not blocked -> safe\n  turn106: U -> y=9 (at turn107) -> done.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn107.\n\nTotal actions: from turn96 to turn106 (inclusive) -> 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we started at turn96. The actions we take are at turns: 96,97,...,106. That is 11 actions (H=11).\n\nBut we have two options for the first two moves:\n\nOption A:\n  turn96: S\n  turn97: S\n\nOption B:\n  turn96: U\n  turn97: D\n\nBoth leave us at y=0 at turn98.\n\nThen from turn98 to turn106: we do 9 U's.\n\nSo total 11 actions.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn98. We cannot avoid that because we cannot jump over the freeways 1-6 in two moves to get to y=7 or above. So 11 moves is the minimal?\n\nBut wait: what if we try to go up as much as possible and then wait at a safe freeway? \n\nFor example, at turn96: we do U -> turn97: y=1.\nThen at turn97: we cannot stay at y=1 (because then turn98 we crash) and we cannot go to y=2 (because freeway2 is blocked at turn98) ... so we must go down to y=0 at turn98.\n\nSo same as above.\n\nAlternatively, at turn96: we do nothing (S) -> then at turn97: we are at y=0. Then we can do nothing again at turn97 to be at y=0 at turn98.\n\nSo both ways we are at y=0 at turn98 and then we do 9 U's.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". So 11 turns.\n\nBut can we avoid the freeway7 and8 block by going faster? We are already going as fast as possible from turn98: 1 per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y=7 or y=8 before turn102 and then wait until after turn104? But that would take more moves.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=7 by turn101? \n\nFrom turn98 (y=0) to turn101: that's 3 moves: we can get to y=3? Then we have to get to y=7: that would take 4 more moves -> at turn105 we are at y=7. But then we are at freeway7 at turn105 (which is safe) and then we go to y=8 at turn106 and y=9 at turn107. Same as before.\n\nIf we try to go faster: we cannot because we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo 11 moves is the minimal.\n\nNow, we have two sequences:\n\nSequence A:\n  turn96: S\n  turn97: S\n  turn98: U\n  turn99: U\n  turn100: U\n  turn101: U\n  turn102: U\n  turn103: U\n  turn104: U\n  turn105: U\n  turn106: U\n\nBut wait, at turn106 we do the last U to get to y=9 at turn107? So the last state is at turn107? Then we have done 11 actions: from turn96 to turn106.\n\nSequence B:\n  turn96: U\n  turn97: D\n  then the same from turn98: 9 U's.\n\nBut note: in sequence B, at turn97 we are at y=1. Then we go down to y=0 at turn98. Then we go up.\n\nBut we have to list the actions for 11 turns.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: at turn97 (when we are at y=1) we are on freeway1? And we check for collision at turn97? \n\nAt turn97: dt=1. For freeway1: \n  car: h0=-48, t0=-83, s=36 -> \n      head = -48+36*1 = -12\n      tail = -83+36*1 = -47\n  So the car is from -47 to -12. 0 is not in that interval? So we are safe at turn97.\n\nSimilarly, for the other freeways: freeways2-6 have the same car? Actually, no: freeways1,2,3 have the same car? But we are on freeway1 at turn97. The car on freeway1 at turn97: as above, not covering 0. So safe.\n\nSo both sequences are safe.\n\nBut which one to choose? The problem asks for minimal H and a sequence. Both have H=11.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", so 11 is the minimal. We can output either.\n\nLet me choose sequence A: because it avoids the up and down.\n\nSequence A:\n\n  Turn96: S\n  Turn97: S\n  Turn98: U\n  Turn99: U\n  Turn100: U\n  Turn101: U\n  Turn102: U\n  Turn103: U\n  Turn104: U\n  Turn105: U\n  Turn106: U\n\nBut wait: at turn106 we do U and then at turn107 we are at y=9. So we have taken 11 actions and the last action is at turn106.\n\nWe must ensure that at every turn we are safe.\n\nCheck:\n\nTurn96: y=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\nAction: S -> next state: turn97, y=0.\n\nTurn97: y=0 -> safe\nAction: S -> turn98: y=0.\n\nTurn98: y=0 -> safe\nAction: U -> turn99: y=1.\n\nBut at turn99: we are at y=1 -> freeway1. Now, turn99: dt=3 (from t1=96).\nFor freeway1: car at dt=3: \n  head = -48+36*3 = -48+108=60\n  tail = -83+108=25\n  So the car is from 25 to 60 -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2,3,4,5,6: same at dt=3? They are not blocked (blocked only at dt=2). So safe.\n\nTurn99: action U -> turn100: y=2.\n\nTurn100: y=2 -> freeway2. dt=4.\nFreeway2: same car: head=60, tail=25 -> safe.\n\nTurn100: U -> turn101: y=3.\n\nTurn101: y=3 -> freeway3. dt=5: same car: head=-48+36*5=-48+180=132, tail=-83+180=97 -> safe.\n\nTurn101: U -> turn102: y=4.\n\nTurn102: y=4 -> freeway4. \nBut freeway4 had a different car? Actually, freeway4: car (-48,-71,right,24)\nAt dt=6? Actually, dt=6: 96+6=102 -> but wait, we are at turn102, so dt = 102-96=6.\n  head = -48+24*6 = -48+144=96\n  tail = -71+144=73\n  So [73,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn102: U -> turn103: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4? \n  freeway5: same car? The state says freeway5: (-48,-71,right,24) -> same as freeway4.\n  At dt=7: \n      head = -48+24*7 = -48+168=120\n      tail = -71+168=97\n  -> safe.\n\nTurn103: U -> turn104: y=6 -> freeway6: same car? \n  dt=8: head=-48+24*8= -48+192=144, tail=-71+192=121 -> safe.\n\nTurn104: U -> turn105: y=7 -> freeway7. \n  At turn105: dt=9.\n  Freeway7: three cars. We need to check if any car blocks at dt=9.\n    Car1: (48,37,right,4) -> at dt=9: head=48+36? wait, s=4 -> head=48+4*9=84, tail=37+36=73 -> [73,84] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Car2: (12,1,right,4) -> head=12+36=48, tail=1+36=37 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n    Car3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> head=-24+4*9=12, tail=-35+36=1 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in? But note: the car spans from 1 to 12. 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nTurn105: U -> turn106: y=8 -> freeway8. \n  dt=10.\n  Freeway8: same as freeway7? \n    Car1: 48+40=88, 37+40=77 -> [77,88] -> safe.\n    Car2: 12+40=52, 1+40=41 -> [41,52] -> safe.\n    Car3: -24+40=16, -35+40=5 -> [5,16] -> safe.\n\nTurn106: U -> turn107: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo sequence A is safe.\n\nNow sequence B:\n\nTurn96: U -> then at turn97: y=1 -> freeway1. \n  As we checked: at dt=1, freeway1: car from -47 to -12 -> safe.\n\nTurn97: D -> then at turn98: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen same as sequence A from turn98.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWe can choose either. I'll choose sequence A because it is simpler (no down move).\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_96: S\nTurn t_97: S\nTurn t_98: U\nTurn t_99: U\nTurn t_100: U\nTurn t_101: U\nTurn t_102: U\nTurn t_103: U\nTurn t_104: U\nTurn t_105: U\nTurn t_106: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\". So H=11, so t from 0 to 10 (relative to t1=96). \n\nThe actions are for:\n  t1+0 = 96: S\n  t1+1 = 97: S\n  t1+2 = 98: U\n  ...\n  t1+10 = 106: U\n\nAnd then at the next state (turn107) we are at y=9.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We found H=11.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 10? \n\nSuppose we try to be at y=9 at turn106? That would require starting from y=0 at turn96, and we have 10 moves (from turn96 to turn105) to go from 0 to 9: which requires 9 moves? But we have 10 moves. So we can do it in 10 moves? Actually, we have 10 actions: the state after 10 actions is at turn96+10 = 106. We need to be at y=9 at that state.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at turn96. Then after 10 actions, we are at turn106. We need to go from 0 to 9: that requires 9 net up moves. So we must have 9 U's and 1 extra move that is not U. But that extra move would be S or D, which doesn't help. So we must have at least 9 U's. So minimal 9 moves? But we have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nIn particular, we must avoid being on freeway1-6 at turn98. We have to use two moves to avoid that: either two S's or one U and one D. So we cannot avoid using two moves to stay at 0? Then we have to use 9 U's. So total 11 moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we use the two moves to go to y=0 at turn98, and then we have 8 moves left? Then we can only get to y=8? So we need one more to get to y=9.\n\nAlternatively, if we could get to y=9 in 9 moves after turn98, that would be turn107. \n\nSo 11 moves is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence above.\n\nBut note: in the sequence above, we have 11 moves.\n\nOne more thing: at turn107 we are at y=9. The problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence. The last action is at turn106, which moves us to (0,9) at turn107.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_96: S\nTurn t_97: S\nTurn t_98: U\nTurn t_99: U\nTurn t_100: U\nTurn t_101: U\nTurn t_102: U\nTurn t_103: U\nTurn t_104: U\nTurn t_105: U\nTurn t_106: U\n}\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 96\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The cars on freeways 1 to 6 are only blocked at turn 98 (relative to \\(t_1\\), and freeways 7 and 8 are blocked at turns 102, 103, and 104 (relative to \\(t_1\\)). The player must avoid being on freeways 1 to 6 at turn 98 and freeways 7 and 8 at turns 102, 103, and 104.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence ensures:\n- At turn 98, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not on a freeway).\n- From turn 99 to 106, the player moves upward, avoiding all blocked freeways at critical turns:\n  - At turn 102 (\\(y = 4\\)), freeway 4 is safe (blocked only at turn 98).\n  - At turn 103 (\\(y = 5\\)), freeway 5 is safe.\n  - At turn 104 (\\(y = 6\\)), freeway 6 is safe.\n  - At turn 105 (\\(y = 7\\)), freeway 7 is safe (blocked at turns 102–104, not 105).\n  - At turn 106 (\\(y = 8\\)), freeway 8 is safe (blocked at turns 102–104, not 106).\n- At turn 107, after the last action, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_96: S\nTurn t_97: S\nTurn t_98: U\nTurn t_99: U\nTurn t_100: U\nTurn t_101: U\nTurn t_102: U\nTurn t_103: U\nTurn t_104: U\nTurn t_105: U\nTurn t_106: U\n}",
