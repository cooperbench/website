        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 4 or 12, but looking at the table, for freeway 2, there's a car with speed 12, and for others, it's mostly speed 4.\n\nLet me list out the cars clearly:\n\n- Freeway 1: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nBut for the position, head and tail. Since they're moving right, for the first car, head is -48, tail is -59? That seems backwards. If it's moving right, and head is at -48, tail at -59, that means the tail is to the left of head, so the car spans from x= -59 to x= -48? But -59 is less than -48, so if head is at -48 and tail at -59, that would imply the car is from x= -59 to x= -48, with head at the right end, I think.\n\nThe car update says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it says for example (-48, -59, right, 4). But in the notation, it's written as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span definition, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might be [tail, head].\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation. Let me check the problem.\n\nIt says: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nThen for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo in the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving car, head is the right end, tail is the left end, so span is from tail to head, [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be head left, tail right or something, but all cars here are right-moving, so no left-moving cars.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for a car with (h, τ, right, s), span at t1 is [τ, h].\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: first car: head -48, tail -59, so span at t1 = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head -12, tail -23, span [-23, -12]\n\nThird car: head 24, tail 13, span [13,24]\n\nTail 13, head 24, so [13,24].\n\nBut head 24, tail 13, 13<24, so [13,24] yes.\n\nNow for freeway 2: only one car: (48,37,right,12) so head 48, tail 37, span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 3: (-48,-59,right,4) span [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4) span [-59,-48], (-12,-23,right,4) span [-23,-12], (24,13,right,4) but head 24, tail 13? Tail 13, head 24, so [13,24]\n\nIn the table it says (24,13,right,4) so head 24, tail 13, so if tail is left, head right, span [13,24].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 5,6 same as 1 and 4.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,4) span [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) span [-59,-48]\n\nNow, t1 is the current turn, which is 0. Player is at (0,0) at turn 0.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=0, I can't go down, similarly at y=9, can't go up, but since I start at y=0 and end at y=9, I need to go up mostly.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I only care about the freeway I am on at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T. If y_T is between 1 and 8, I need that no car on that freeway has 0 in span at time T.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, I am safe.\n\nNow, the car positions change with time.\n\nSince all cars are moving right at constant speed, I can find when they cover x=0.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, find the times when 0 is in [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for T >= t1.\n\nt1=0, so for a car with span [τ, h] at t=0, speed s, right-moving.\n\nSpan at time T: [τ + sT, h + sT]\n\n0 in span if τ + sT <= 0 <= h + sT\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h <= sT <= -τ\n\nSince s >0, T >=0.\n\nSo T such that max( ceil( (-h)/s ) , something) let's think.\n\nτ + sT <= 0 and 0 <= h + sT\n\nSo from τ + sT <= 0: sT <= -τ, so T <= floor(-τ / s) ? Let's be careful.\n\nτ + sT <= 0 implies sT <= -τ, since s>0, T <= floor(-τ / s) if -τ/s integer, else floor, but need inequality.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + sT implies sT >= -h, T >= ceil(-h / s)\n\nThen T must satisfy ceil(-h / s) <= T <= floor(-τ / s)\n\nSince τ <= h, -h <= -τ, so ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s) possibly.\n\nThen 0 is covered at times T in that interval.\n\nIf ceil(-h/s) > floor(-τ/s), no coverage.\n\nNow for each car, I can find the time intervals when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for each freeway, since there might be multiple cars, I need the union of these intervals for that freeway.\n\nThen for row k, at time T, if k is between 1 and 8, and if T is in the coverage interval for that freeway, then collision if I am there.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0 at T=0, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9 turns, since I need to increase y by 9, and each U increases by 1, S or D don't help, so to minimize turns, I should always go up, but I might need to wait sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions from t1 to t1+H-1, so after H actions, I am at turn t1+H-1 position.\n\nStart at turn t1=0, position after action a_t.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position after action a_T.\n\nDefine: at turn T, before action, I am at position (0, y_T), then I choose action a_T, which determines Δy, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, and I move to (0, y_{T+1}) at turn T+1? Let's see.\n\nFrom player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAt time t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen after action a_t, I go to y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nThe collision is at turn T: if I am on freeway y_T, and cars on that freeway cover x=0 at time T.\n\nSo at turn T, I am at row y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, and at that exact time T, some car covers x=0.\n\nNow for each freeway, I need to find for which times T it is occupied, meaning x=0 covered.\n\nThen I need to plan a path from y=0 at T=0 to y=9 at some T, with y changing by -1,0,1 each step.\n\nTo minimize the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at T=0, y=0, and I want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal possible is T=9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might be blocked by cars on some rows.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nRow k=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, find the set of T where for some car on row k, 0 in span at T.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but time is discrete, T integer.\n\nt1=0.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and their coverage.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCars:\n\n1. (h=-48, τ=-59, s=4) span at T: [-59 +4T, -48 +4T]\n\n0 in span if -59+4T <= 0 <= -48+4T\n\nSo 4T <= 48 and 4T >= 59? From -59+4T <= 0: 4T <= 59, T <= 59/4 = 14.75, so T <= 14 since T integer? T <= floor(59/4) = 14? 4*14=56, -59+56= -3 <=0, -48+56=8>=0, so 0<=8 true, -3<=0 true.\n\n-59+4T <=0 implies 4T <=59, T <= floor(59/4) =14.75, so T<=14? 59/4=14.75, floor 14, but 4*14=56, -59+56=-3 <=0, yes.\n\n0 <= -48+4T implies -48+4T >=0, 4T >=48, T>=12.\n\nSo for this car, T from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nT>= ceil(48/4) =12, T<= floor(59/4)=14.75 floor 14.\n\nYes T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=12: span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] , 0 in.\n\nT=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=15: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, second car on row1: (h=-12, τ=-23, s=4) span at T: [-23+4T, -12+4T]\n\n0 in if -23+4T <=0 <= -12+4T\n\nSo 4T <=23? -23+4T <=0 => 4T<=23, T<=5.75, T<=5\n\n0 <= -12+4T => 4T>=12, T>=3\n\nT from 3 to 5.\n\nT=3: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=4: [-19, -8]? -23+16= -7, -12+16=4, span [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nThird car: (h=24, τ=13, s=4) span [13+4T, 24+4T] since right-moving, τ=13, h=24, span [13+4T, 24+4T]\n\n0 in if 13+4T <=0 <=24+4T\n\nBut 13+4T <=0? 4T <= -13, T <= -3.25, impossible since T>=0.\n\nSo never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, 24+4T >=0 always true for T>=0, but the left condition not satisfied.\n\nSo only first two cars cover on row1.\n\nTimes unsafe for row1: from car1: T=12,13,14; car2: T=3,4,5. So union: T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (48,37,right,12) head 48, tail 37, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [37 +12T, 48+12T]\n\n0 in if 37+12T <=0 <=48+12T\n\nBut 37+12T <=0? 12T <= -37, T<= -37/12 ~ -3.08, impossible.\n\nSo never covers 0. So row2 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\n37+12T >=37>0 for T>=0, so left end positive, so 0 not in span. Yes, safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 3: only one car: (-48,-59,right,4) same as first car on row1.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, s=4, span [-59+4T, -48+4T]\n\n0 in for T=12,13,14 as above.\n\nSo unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as row1: cars like row1.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) unsafe T=3,4,5\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) never unsafe.\n\nSo unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14 same as row1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: same, unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (-48,-59,right,4) unsafe only T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: one car (-48,-59,right,4) unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nAnd row2 is always safe.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, unsafe times:\n\n- Row1: unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\n- Row2: always safe\n\n- Row3: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\n- Row4: unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\n- Row5: unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\n- Row6: unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\n- Row7: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\n- Row8: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, I start at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt each turn, I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince I want to minimize the arrival time, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, let me denote the time when I arrive at each row.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nThe minimal T to reach y=9 is 9, if I go up every step.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=9 by T=9.\n\nI need to check for each row from 1 to 8, when I am on it, if it is safe at that time.\n\nSince I move step by step.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I choose action for T=0.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, if I go straight up:\n\nAt T=0, y=0, I go U, so at T=1, y=1.\n\nAt T=1, I am on row y=1. Is row1 safe at T=1?\n\nFrom above, row1 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=1 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=1, I can go U, to y=2 at T=2.\n\ny=2 at T=2: row2 is always safe, so ok.\n\nThen U to y=3 at T=3.\n\ny=3 at T=3: row3 unsafe at T=12,13,14? Row3 unsafe at T=12,13,14 only? From above, row3 is freeway 3, which is unsafe only at T=12,13,14. T=3 is not unsafe, so should be safe.\n\nBut let me confirm: row3 has only one car, unsafe only at T=12,13,14. So at T=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row1 is unsafe at T=3,4,5, but I am on row3, not row1.\n\nAt T=3, I am on row3.\n\nRow3 is freeway 3, which is unsafe only at T=12,13,14, so at T=3, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=4 at T=4.\n\ny=4 at T=4: row4 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=4 is unsafe.\n\nSo if I am on row4 at T=4, collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on row4 at T=4.\n\nBut in the direct path, at T=4, I would be on row4, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4 at another time.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nI could stay or go down to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut since I want to go up, I should wait at safe rows.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\n- y=1: unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\n- y=2: always safe\n\n- y=3: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\n- y=4: unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\n- y=5: unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\n- y=6: unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\n- y=7: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\n- y=8: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\ny=2 is always safe, good.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nThe constraint is when I am on y=1 to 8 at time T, it must be safe.\n\nSince I move one row per action when I go up, the time to go from y=a to y=b takes at least |b-a| turns.\n\nTo minimize arrival time at y=9, I should go up as fast as possible, but may need to delay on some rows.\n\nNow, let's find the earliest time I can be on each row.\n\nI can think of a path with possible waiting.\n\nSince y=2 is always safe, I can stay there if needed.\n\nFirst, from T=0, y=0.\n\nI must go to y=1 at some point.\n\ny=1 is unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSo I can be on y=1 only at T not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so T=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,... etc.\n\nBut since I start at y=0, I can go to y=1 at T=1 by going U at T=0.\n\nAt T=0, y=0, I do action, go to y=1 at T=1.\n\nT=1 is safe for y=1, as above.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=1, I can go to y=2 at T=2.\n\ny=2 at T=2 safe.\n\nNow from y=2 at T=2, I need to go to y=3.\n\ny=3 is unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=2, I can go U to y=3 at T=3.\n\nT=3, is y=3 safe? y=3 unsafe only at T=12,13,14, so T=3 is safe, yes.\n\nSo go U to y=3 at T=3.\n\nNow at T=3, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nAt T=3, if I go U to y=4 at T=4, but at T=4, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=3, but at T=4, if I am at y=3, is it safe? y=3 unsafe at T=12,13,14, so at T=4, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay at y=3 for a while.\n\nBut I need to go to y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5, so I can go to y=4 at T=2? But at T=2, I was at y=2, not y=3 yet.\n\nLet's think the times I can arrive at y=4.\n\nI must come from y=3 or y=5, but since I am going up, from y=3.\n\nSo I arrive at y=4 at time T when I move from y=3 to y=4 at time T-1? Let's define the time when I am on the row.\n\nAt time T, I am at row y_T.\n\nThen to go to y_{T+1} = y_T + a_T.\n\nSo to be at y=4 at time T, I must have been at y=3 or y=5 at time T-1, and moved accordingly.\n\nSince I start from below, likely from y=3.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at T=3,4,5, so I can be at y=4 only at T not in {3,4,5}, so T<=2 or T>=6.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nAt T=3, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nI cannot go to y=4 immediately because at T=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo I might stay at y=3 for some time.\n\ny=3 is safe except at T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=3, y=3 safe.\n\nI can do S at T=3, so at T=4, I am still at y=3.\n\nAt T=4, y=3 is safe, since unsafe only later.\n\nThen at T=4, I am at y=3, I can do S again, to T=5, y=3.\n\nAt T=5, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at T=5, I can go U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nNow at T=6, y=4: is it safe? y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=6 not in, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo from T=3 to T=5, I stay at y=3, then at T=5, go U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nNow at T=6, y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nT=6 not unsafe, so I can go U at T=6 to y=5 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, y=5: unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14? T=7 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=6 at T=8.\n\ny=6 at T=8: unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=8 not in, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at T=9.\n\ny=7 at T=9: row7 unsafe at T=12,13,14, so T=9 safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=10.\n\ny=8 at T=10: row8 unsafe at T=12,13,14, so T=10 safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? I spent extra time staying at y=3.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nThe problem is around T=3,4,5 where multiple rows are unsafe.\n\ny=4,5,6 are all unsafe from T=3 to5, and y=1 also, but I avoided by staying at y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe during that time.\n\nI could go faster if I skip some rows or something, but I have to go through each row.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 is always safe, I could go to y=2 and stay, but I need to go up.\n\nAt T=2, I was at y=2.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 for some time, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=2, I could stay at T=2, so at T=3, y=2.\n\nThen at T=3, y=2 safe, I can go U to y=3 at T=4? But at T=4, if I go to y=3, y=3 is safe at T=4, since unsafe only at 12-14.\n\nThen from y=3 at T=4, I can go to y=4 at T=5? But y=4 unsafe at T=5.\n\nT=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo I need to wait.\n\nIf at T=4, y=3, I stay, to T=5, y=3, then at T=5, go U to y=4 at T=6, same as before.\n\nNo saving.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=2, I go directly to y=3 at T=3, as I did first.\n\nThen wait at y=3.\n\nCan I go to a different row?\n\nFor example, at T=3, instead of staying, go down? But y=2 is safe, but going down delays me more.\n\nNot useful.\n\nSo the path I have seems ok.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at T=11.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier?\n\nMinimal time: since from T=3 to T=5, rows 4,5,6 are unsafe, so I cannot be on them during those times.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=6, I need at least 3 steps, but during T=4,5,6? Times.\n\nSuppose I am at y=3 at some time.\n\nTo reach y=6, I need to go up three times.\n\nBut if I start from y=3 at time T, I can be at y=4 at T+1, y=5 at T+2, y=6 at T+3.\n\nNow, I need that at T+1, y=4 safe; T+2, y=5 safe; T+3, y=6 safe.\n\ny=4,5,6 all unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nSo if T+1, T+2, T+3 avoid 3,4,5.\n\nFor example, if I start from y=3 at T=2, then y=4 at T=3, but T=3 unsafe for y=4? y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5, so at T=3, y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I start from y=3 at T=1, but at T=1, I was at y=1, not y=3 yet.\n\nAt T=1, y=1; T=2, y=2; T=3, y=3.\n\nIf I go faster earlier, but I start at y=0 T=0.\n\nTo be at y=3 earlier.\n\nAt T=0, y=0, U to y=1 at T=1.\n\nThen U to y=2 at T=2.\n\nThen U to y=3 at T=3.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen I have to wait until T=6 to be at y=4, as I did.\n\nIf I can be at y=3 before T=3.\n\nBut I can't, since from y=0, min time to y=3 is T=3.\n\nT=0 y=0, T=1 y=1, T=2 y=2, T=3 y=3.\n\nSo I must be at y=3 at T=3 or later.\n\nThen to avoid the unsafe times for y=4,5,6, I need to be on y=4 at T>=6 or T<=2, but T<=2 impossible since at T=2 I am at y=2.\n\nSo must be at y=4 at T>=6.\n\nSimilarly, earliest I can be at y=4 is T=6, by waiting at y=3 from T=3 to T=5, then move at T=5 to y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen y=5 at T=7, y=6 at T=8, etc., to y=9 at T=11.\n\nIf I go directly without waiting, but I can't because of the unsafe times.\n\nAnother possibility: since y=2 is safe, I could go to y=2 and stay longer, but that would make me arrive later, not earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=2, I stay until some time, but then I start later, so y=9 later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo T=11 seems earliest possible.\n\nBut let me check the later unsafe times, like T=12,13,14 for some rows.\n\nIn my path, I reach y=9 at T=11, before T=12, so no issue.\n\nFor example, at T=11, y=9, I am already at goal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output actions from turn t1=0 to the turn before reaching y=9.\n\nI reach y=9 at T=11, which is after 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn 0, position (0, y_0) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_0, I go to y_1 at turn 1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, I go to y_H at turn H.\n\nAnd y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn H, I am at y_H=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\nIn terms of time, at time T, I am at y_T after action a_{T-1}? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, I move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nThe collision is at turn t, if I am on y_t and it is unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, I need actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, I am at (0,9).\n\nSo H is the number of actions.\n\nStart: turn 0, position (0,0)\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, position (0,9)\n\nAnd during the sequence, for each turn t from 0 to H-1, when I am at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, it must be safe at time t.\n\nIn my earlier, I have:\n\nTurn 0: at y=0, safe, I do U, so go to y=1 at turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: at y=1, time t=1, y=1 safe? Yes, as unsafe only 3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nThen I do U, go to y=2 at turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: at y=2, safe, do U, go to y=3 at turn 3.\n\nTurn 3: at y=3, time t=3, safe (unsafe only 12-14), do S? In my plan, I need to stay.\n\nAt turn 3, I do S, so y_{t+1} = y_t +0 =3, so at turn 4, still y=3.\n\nTurn 4: at y=3, time t=4, safe, do S, go to turn 5, y=3.\n\nTurn 5: at y=3, time t=5, safe, do U, go to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: at y=4, time t=6, safe (unsafe 3,4,5,12,13,14; t=6 ok), do U, go to y=5 at turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: at y=5, time t=7, safe, do U, go to y=6 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: at y=6, time t=8, safe, do U, go to y=7 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: at y=7, time t=9, safe (unsafe 12,13,14; t=9 ok), do U, go to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: at y=8, time t=10, safe, do U, go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow at turn 11, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nSo I took actions from turn 0 to turn 10, that's 11 actions, reached at turn 11.\n\nH=11.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=2 and stay, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4,5,6 are unsafe at T=3,4,5, but I could be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, I could delay going up initially.\n\nBut I start at y=0, I can go up at T=0 or later, but going up later might not help.\n\nFor instance, at T=0, I do S, stay at y=0 until some time.\n\nBut y=0 safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSuppose at T=0, I do S, so at turn 1, still y=0.\n\nTurn 0: S, to turn 1 y=0.\n\nThen at turn 1, I can go U to y=1 at turn 2.\n\nTurn 1: at y=0, do U, to turn 2 y=1.\n\nAt turn 2, y=1, time t=2, safe? y=1 unsafe at 3,4,5,12,13,14, t=2 not in, safe.\n\nThen U to y=2 at turn 3.\n\nTurn 3: at y=2, safe, do U to y=3 at turn 4.\n\nTurn 4: at y=3, time t=4, safe, do U to y=4? But at turn 5, y=4, time t=5, unsafe! Because y=4 unsafe at t=5.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 4, if I go U to y=4 at turn 5, t=5 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to stay or something.\n\nAt turn 4, y=3, I can do S, to turn 5 y=3.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=3, do U to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nThen same as before, but I started later, so I reach y=9 later, at turn 12 or something.\n\nTurn 0: S, to turn 1 y=0\n\nTurn 1: U, to turn 2 y=1\n\nTurn 2: U, to turn 3 y=2\n\nTurn 3: U, to turn 4 y=3\n\nTurn 4: S, to turn 5 y=3\n\nTurn 5: U, to turn 6 y=4\n\nThen U to turn 7 y=5, U to turn 8 y=6, U to turn 9 y=7, U to turn 10 y=8, U to turn 11 y=9.\n\nReached at turn 11 same as before, but I used an extra S at beginning, so more actions? Turn 0 to turn 10 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions to reach at turn 11.\n\nSame number: in first path, actions t=0 to t=10, 11 actions.\n\nHere also 11 actions, but I stayed at y=0 one extra turn, so arrived same time but with one more action? No.\n\nIn first path: actions t=0 U, t=1 U, t=2 U, t=3 S, t=4 S, t=5 U, t=6 U, t=7 U, t=8 U, t=9 U, t=10 U. That's 11 actions, to turn 11 y=9.\n\nIn the alternative: t=0 S, t=1 U, t=2 U, t=3 U, t=4 S, t=5 U, t=6 U, t=7 U, t=8 U, t=9 U, t=10 U. Also 11 actions to turn 11 y=9.\n\nBut in this, at turn 4 I did S at y=3, same as before.\n\nBut I have an extra S at t=0, which didn't help.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus, the first path is fine.\n\nBut in the first path, I have to stay at y=3 for two turns, t=3 and t=4 actions S.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 3 and turn 4, both S actions.\n\nNow, what about the later unsafe times? In this case, I reach before T=12, so no issue.\n\nBut just to confirm, for example, if I were on y=7 at T=12, it would be unsafe, but I am at T=9 on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, the number of turns.\n\nIs there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nThen I must have been at y=8 at turn 9, and did U at turn 9 to y=9 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9, y=8 must be safe, which it is, since unsafe only at 12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 8, I must be at y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet, so at y=7, and I go U to y=8 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, y=7 must be safe, which at t=8, y=7 unsafe only at 12-14, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 7, I must be at y=6 or y=8, say y=6, go U to y=7 at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 7, y=6 must be safe. y=6 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at t=7, which is not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 6, I must be at y=5 or y=7, say y=5, go U to y=6 at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 6, y=5 must be safe. y=5 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14, t=6 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 5, I must be at y=4 or y=6, say y=4, go U to y=5 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 5, y=4 must be safe. But y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5, so at t=5, unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf at turn 5, I am at y=6, but y=6 at t=5: unsafe, since y=6 unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nt=5 is in 3,4,5? T=3,4,5, so t=5 unsafe for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=5 unsafe.\n\nNow, at turn 4, I must be at y=3 or y=5 or y=7, etc., to reach y= something at turn 5.\n\nBut y=3 at t=4: safe? y=3 unsafe only at 12-14, so safe.\n\ny=5 at t=4: unsafe, since y=5 unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nSo at turn 4, if I am at y=3, which is safe, I can go to y=4 at turn 5, but y=4 at t=5 unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=2, but y=2 at t=4 safe, but then I am going down, which delays.\n\nFor example, suppose at turn 4, I am at y=3, do D, go to y=2 at turn 5.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=2 safe, but then I need to go back up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 by turn 10, I need to be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nFrom turn 5 y=2, I need to go to y=9 in 5 steps, which is possible only if I go up every step, to y=7 at turn 10? Let's see.\n\nTurn 5: at y=2, do U to y=3 at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: y=3, do U to y=4 at turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: y=4, do U to y=5 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: y=5, do U to y=6 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: y=6, do U to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn 10, here at turn 10 y=7, not 9.\n\nI can go faster? From y=2 at turn 5, to y=9 at turn 10, I need 7 steps up, but only 5 actions: turn 5 to turn 9 actions, 5 actions, to go from y=2 to y=7, not to y=9.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 from y=2 in 5 actions; min 7 actions needed.\n\nBut from turn 5 to turn 9, 4 actions? Actions at turn t affect y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, action determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo from after turn t, y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y_{10} =9, I need to start from some point.\n\nAt turn 4, after action, y_5.\n\nI need y_{10} =9.\n\nThe position at turn 10 is after action at turn 9.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + a_9.\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, since y_9 <=9, likely a_9=U if y_9=8.\n\nBut y_9 must be 8 to go to 9 with U.\n\nSimilarly, y_10=9 requires y_9=8 and a_9=U.\n\nThen y_9=8 requires y_8=7 or 9, but 9 not, so y_8=7 and a_8=U, or y_8=8 and a_8=S, but S keeps same, so to increase, need U.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y_9=8, must have y_8=7 or 8 or 9, but from below, y_8=7 with U.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=7 requires y_7=6 or 7 with U or S, etc.\n\nSo to have y_{10}=9, we must have y_9=8 and a_9=U.\n\ny_9=8 requires y_8=7 and a_8=U (since if S, y_9=7, not 8; if D, y_9=6, etc.)\n\nSimilarly, y_8=7 requires y_7=6 and a_7=U? y_7=6, a_7=U to y_8=7.\n\ny_7=7, a_7=S to y_8=7, but then y_8=7, need a_8=U to y_9=8.\n\nBut we need y_9=8, so if y_7=7, a_7=S to y_8=7, then a_8=U to y_9=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=7 can be from y_7=7 with S, or y_7=6 with U.\n\nBut to minimize time, we go up.\n\nFor y_10=9, we need:\n\ny_9=8 and a_9=U\n\ny_8 must be 7 or 8; if y_8=7, a_8=U to y_9=8; if y_8=8, a_8=S to y_9=8.\n\nBut if y_8=8, a_8=S, y_9=8, then a_9=U to y_10=9.\n\nBut y_8=8 means we reached earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y_7 must be such that we can get to y_8.\n\nBut for H=10, y_10=9, so actions from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions.\n\nAt turn 9, we do a_9, to y_10=9.\n\nSo y_10=9.\n\nNow, at turn 9, when we do a_9, we are at position y_9, and we choose a_9.\n\nFor y_10=9, we need y_9=8 and a_9=U.\n\ny_9=8 must be safe at turn 9.\n\ny_8 must be 7 or 8 or 9, but to have y_9=8, from y_8=7 with a_8=U, or y_8=8 with a_8=S, etc.\n\nBut let's list the y_t for t=5 to 10.\n\nWe need y_10=9.\n\nThis requires y_9=8 and a_9=U.\n\ny_9=8 must be true at turn 9, and safe.\n\ny_9=8 can be from: y_8=7 and a_8=U, or y_8=8 and a_8=S.\n\nSimilarly, y_8 must be 7 or 8.\n\nIf y_8=7, it must be safe at turn 8.\n\nIf y_8=8, safe at turn 8.\n\nNow for y_10=9 at turn 10, we need to be at y=8 at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, y=8 must be safe, which it is, as before.\n\nBut the issue is at earlier times.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 5, we need to be at some y, and it must be safe.\n\nFor y_10=9, turn 10 is after action at turn 9.\n\nThe time when we are on intermediate rows.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, we must be at some y_5 between 0 and 9.\n\ny_5 must be safe at t=5.\n\nNow, at t=5, which rows are unsafe?\n\ny=1 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, y=6 unsafe, and others safe except later times.\n\ny=1,4,5,6 unsafe at t=5.\n\ny=2 safe, y=3 safe, y=7 safe, y=8 safe, y=0 and y=9 safe but may not be there.\n\nSo at turn 5, to be safe, y_5 must be in {0,2,3,7,8,9}, but since we are going up, likely y=2 or 3 or 7,8.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_9=8 from y_5.\n\nFrom turn 5 to turn 9, 4 actions to increase from y_5 to y_9=8.\n\ny_9=8, y_5 must be at least 4, since 4 actions, max increase 4, so y_5 <=4? y_5 + sum Δy = y_9.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_9 <= y_5 + 4.\n\nSince y_9=8, y_5 <=4? y_5 +4 >=8, so y_5 >=4.\n\nSimilarly, y_5 <=8, but from above y_5 >=4.\n\ny_5 >=4 and y_5 <=8, but y_5 must be safe at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, y=4,5,6 unsafe, so y_5 cannot be 4,5,6.\n\ny_5 must be 7 or 8? But y_5 >=4 and <=8, but 4,5,6 unsafe, so y_5=7 or 8.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at t=5.\n\nNow, if y_5=7, then from turn 5 to turn 9, to have y_9=8, I need to increase by only 1 in 4 actions, so I must stay or go down, but that might not help.\n\ny_5=7, then I need y_9=8.\n\nWith 4 actions, I can go up once and stay or down, but to reach y_9=8, I can do, for example, at turn 5, y=7, do S, to y=7 at turn 6; turn 6, S to y=7 turn 7; turn 7, S to y=7 turn 8; turn 8, U to y=8 turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=8, do U to y=9 turn 10.\n\nBut y_10=9, yes.\n\nBut at turn 5, I am at y=7, which is possible?\n\nBut how to get to y=7 by turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, y_5=7.\n\nBut from start, at turn 0, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=7 by turn 5, min 5 steps: turn 0 to 5 actions to y=7.\n\nBut let's see if I can.\n\nTurn 0: U to y=1 turn 1\n\nTurn 1: U to y=2 turn 2\n\nTurn 2: U to y=3 turn 3\n\nTurn 3: U to y=4 turn 4, but at turn 4, y=4, time t=4, unsafe! Because y=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nCollision.\n\nTurn 3: at y=3, if I go U to y=4 at turn 4, t=4 unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 3, I do S, to y=3 turn 4, then at turn 4, y=3, I can U to y=4 at turn 5, but t=5, y=4 unsafe again.\n\nCannot be on y=4 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 5, I need to pass through y=4,5,6 at turns between.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at turn 5, I must have been at y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at turn 4.\n\nBut at turn 4, if y=6, y=6 unsafe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5 unsafe.\n\ny=7 at t=4 safe? y=7 unsafe only at 12-14, t=4 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn 5, it could be from turn 4 y=7 with S, or y=6 with U.\n\nBut if from y=6 with U at turn 4, then at turn 4, I am at y=6? At turn 4, position y_4.\n\nIf I do a_4, to y_5.\n\nTo have y_5=7, if y_4=6, a_4=U; or y_4=7, a_4=S; etc.\n\nBut at turn 4, y_4 must be safe.\n\nIf y_4=6, then at t=4, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=7, safe, but then to have y_5=7, I can do S.\n\nBut I need to be at y_4=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at turn 4.\n\ny_4=7 must be safe at t=4, which it is.\n\nNow, how to reach y=7 at turn 4.\n\nFrom y=0 at turn 0, to y=7 at turn 4, min 4 steps: U,U,U,U.\n\nTurn 0: U to y=1 t1\n\nTurn 1: U to y=2 t2\n\nTurn 2: U to y=3 t3\n\nTurn 3: U to y=4 t4, but at turn 4, y=4, t=4 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nTurn 3: at y=3, if I do something else.\n\nBut to go up, I have to go through y=4 at some point.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=4 is turn 4, but unsafe.\n\nAt turn 4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nI can be at y=4 only at turn 6 or later, as before.\n\nThus, impossible to be at y=7 by turn 5, since to be at y=7 at turn 5, I must have been at y=6 or y=7 at turn 4, but y=6 at t=4 unsafe, and if at y=7 at turn 4, I need to reach y=7 earlier, which requires being at y=4 at some point, but y=4 cannot be before turn 6 safely.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 by turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for H=10.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn my first plan:\n\nTurn 0: at (0,0), do U, go to (0,1) at turn 1\n\nTurn 1: at (0,1), do U, go to (0,2) at turn 2\n\nTurn 2: at (0,2), do U, go to (0,3) at turn 3\n\nTurn 3: at (0,3), do S, go to (0,3) at turn 4\n\nTurn 4: at (0,3), do S, go to (0,3) at turn 5\n\nTurn 5: at (0,3), do U, go to (0,4) at turn 6\n\nTurn 6: at (0,4), do U, go to (0,5) at turn 7\n\nTurn 7: at (0,5), do U, go to (0,6) at turn 8\n\nTurn 8: at (0,6), do U, go to (0,7) at turn 9\n\nTurn 9: at (0,7), do U, go to (0,8) at turn 10\n\nTurn 10: at (0,8), do U, go to (0,9) at turn 11\n\nActions: from t=0 to t=10.\n\nThe answer should list actions for turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 is given as current turn, but in the state, current turn is t_0=0, and t_1 is probably a variable, but here it's 0.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\", and \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc.\n\nBut in the state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 = 0\", so t_1 should be 0.\n\nAnd player position at turn t_1 is (0,0).\n\nSo actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=11, so actions for turn 0 to 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the output format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nWith t_1=0.\n\nBut since t_1 is given, I should use t_1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be in terms of t_1.\n\nBut in the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nSince t_1 is the starting turn, I can write:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 10: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + 11, position (0,9).\n\nBut the actions are up to t_1 + 10.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn t_1 + 3 and t_1 + 4, I have S.\n\nBut is there a way with only one S? Probably not, since I need to avoid T=4 and T=5 for y=4,5,6.\n\nIn this case, I avoided by staying at y=3.\n\nI could stay at y=2, but y=2 is safe, but if I stay at y=2, I arrive later.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, y=2, if I do S at turn 2, to y=2 at turn 3.\n\nThen at turn 3, y=2, do U to y=3 at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 4, y=3, do U to y=4 at turn 5? But at turn 5, y=4, t=5 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo S at turn 4, to y=3 turn 5, then U to y=4 turn 6, same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nThus, the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 2: I thought it was always safe, but let me double-check.\n\nFreeway 2: car (48,37,right,12), span at T: [37+12T, 48+12T]\n\nSince 37+12T >=37>0 for T>=0, so 0 not in [37+12T,48+12T], so indeed always safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nIn the beginning, for row1, I have cars covering at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14, but in my path, I am not on row1 at those times except T=1 and2, which are safe.\n\nT=1 and2 not unsafe for row1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions must ensure that at each turn, the player is not on a freeway row (i.e., \\(y_t \\in \\{1, \\dots, 8\\}\\)) where a car covers \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times for Each Freeway\nThe cars move right at constant speeds, and their positions at time \\(T\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 0\\)) are calculated. Collision occurs if the player is on a freeway row \\(k\\) at turn \\(T\\) and \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that row at \\(T\\). The unsafe times for each freeway are:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)  \n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\))  \n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\)  \n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)  \n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)  \n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)  \n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\)  \n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\)  \n\nRows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are safe at all times.\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\nThe goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. The minimal path requires 11 turns (actions from \\(t = t_1\\) to \\(t = t_1 + 10\\)), arriving at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 11\\). The sequence involves moving up when possible but waiting at \\(y = 3\\) during turns \\(t_1 + 3\\) and \\(t_1 + 4\\) to avoid the unsafe period \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) for rows \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\).\n\n- At \\(T = 0\\): Start at \\((0, 0)\\), safe.\n- Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 1\\) (safe, as \\(y=1\\) unsafe only at \\(T=3,4,5,12,13,14\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 2\\) (always safe).\n- Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y=3\\) unsafe only at \\(T=12,13,14\\)).\n- Stay at \\(y = 3\\) for \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\) to avoid unsafe rows \\(y=4,5,6\\) at \\(T=4\\) and \\(T=5\\).\n- After the unsafe period, move up consecutively from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 11\\).\n\nThis path achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 11\\) with no collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{10}\\) (11 actions) is:\n\n- Turn \\(t_1\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=1\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=2\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 2\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=3\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 3\\): \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y=3\\) to avoid unsafe rows)\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 4\\): \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y=3\\) to avoid unsafe rows)\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 5\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=4\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 6\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=5\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 7\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=6\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 8\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=7\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 9\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=8\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 10\\): \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=9\\))\n\nAfter these actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 11\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 8\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 9\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 10\\text{: } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 2, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant note: \n- The player updates at each turn: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t is +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S). The player must stay in [0,9].\n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T at turn T (so only the cars on freeway y_T at turn T matter). At the next turn, the player will be on y_{T+1} and then check cars on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe car update:\n- For a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n  - If left-moving (we don't have any left-moving in this data? all are right?): span at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] -> note: the head is the front? In the example, for right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? But in the given data, for freeway 1: (-40,-51,right,4) -> head=-40, tail=-51? That would imply the car is from -51 to -40? and then moving right, so at time T, the car would be [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] = [-51 + 4*(T-2), -40 + 4*(T-2)]\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), head + s (T-t1)]\" and similarly for left.\n\nHowever, in the given data, for freeway 1: \n  (-40, -51, right, 4) -> head=-40, tail=-51. Since it's right-moving, the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost? But here head=-40 and tail=-51, so -40 > -51, so the car is from -51 to -40? Then when moving right, the entire car moves to the right.\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn t1, if d is right, then at turn T:\n  left_end = tau + s*(T-t1)\n  right_end = h + s*(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, we would have:\n  left_end = h - s*(T-t1)\n  right_end = tau - s*(T-t1)   [but note: in the example for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and then it moves left?]\n\nBut in our case, all cars are right-moving? Let me check the data:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  (-40, -51, right, 4) -> so at turn 2: the car is from -51 to -40? Actually, the problem says for right: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But note: the representation in the table is (head, tail, ...) so for right, head is the right end and tail is the left end? But in the example: (-40, -51, right, 4): head=-40, tail=-51. So the car spans from -51 (left) to -40 (right). Then at turn T, it will be at [ -51 + 4*(T-2), -40 + 4*(T-2) ]\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway 1: (-4, -15, right, 4) -> from -15 to -4? and (32,21,right,4) -> wait, 32 is head and 21 is tail? So 21 to 32? But 21<32, so that's consistent.\n\nBut note: the third car: (32,21,right,4) -> head=32, tail=21. Then at turn 2, it is [21,32]. Then at T, [21+4*(T-2), 32+4*(T-2)].\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, then collision.\n\nWe start at turn 2 at y=2. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 7 because we start at y=2 and need to go to y=9, and we can only move one step per turn. But we might have to wait sometimes to avoid collisions, so it might be more.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 2.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn 2.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, or S) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to 8) and we must avoid being on a freeway when a car on that freeway covers 0 at the same turn.\n\nWe are currently at y=2. We are about to take an action at turn 2 that will determine y_3. But note: at turn 2, we are on freeway 2? Actually, at turn 2 we are at (0,2) so we are on freeway 2? But note the freeways are y=1,...,8. So y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nBut wait: the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are on the freeway. So at turn 2, we are on freeway 2. We must check if at turn 2, freeway 2 has a car that covers 0.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nAt turn 2, the car is at: [ -59 + 12*(2-2) = -59, -48 + 12*(2-2)= -48] -> [-59, -48]. Does 0 fall in [-59,-48]? No, because -48 < 0? Actually, -59 to -48 is all negative, so 0 is not in there. So we are safe at turn 2.\n\nNow, we take an action at turn 2 that will move us to y_3.\n\nOur goal: minimize H (the number of turns including the starting turn? But note: we start at turn 2 and we take actions for t=0 to H-1? Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, but in the context of the current turn being t1, so the actions are at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at the end of these H actions, we are at turn t1+H-1? Actually, after H actions, we have advanced H turns? Let me see:\n\nWe are at turn t1 (which is 2). We take an action a_{t1} at turn 2, then we are at turn 3 and position y_3. Then we take a_{t1+1} at turn 3, and so on until we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we have the next state? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at the next turn (t1+H) we have the state after the last action. But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, the index: \n- At turn t1, we are at y_{t1}. \n- Then we take action a_{t1} and move to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n- Then at turn t1+1 we take a_{t1+1} and move to y_{t1+2} at turn t1+2.\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-1 we take the last action a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? That doesn't make sense because the position after the last action is at turn t1+H. \n\nLet me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is taken from t=0 to H-1, meaning the actions are taken at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at the time after the last action, the state is at time t1+H. But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). That would be the state at the time we take the last action? But actually, the state at the time we take the action is the starting state for that action.\n\nClarification from the update rule: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the turn when we take the action (turn t), we are at y_t. After the action, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe condition for the goal is: we want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note: the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1. Then at that turn, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then after the action, we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δa. \n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? That would be before the last action? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo at the turn t1+H-1 (which is the turn when we take the last action), the position must be (0,9). But note: at that turn, we are at (0,9) and then we take an action? But then we might move? \n\nHowever, the goal condition is achieved at the beginning of that turn? Or after? \n\nActually, the state y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t. Then we take an action a_t and move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nSo if we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T, then we set T = t1+H-1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But we don't care about what happens after because we have reached the goal at the beginning of that turn? \n\nHowever, note that we are required to take H actions. So the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1. But if we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action? But the sequence must have H actions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then we would have taken H actions and ended at (0,9). But the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo let me parse: \n  H is the number of turns we are considering? The sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions). Then at the end of these actions, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H is determined. But the problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\". And then after that, we are at turn t1+H. But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δa, which might be 8,9,10 (but 10 is invalid) so we can only do S to stay at 9? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H? But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me read carefully: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nBut note: the minimal number of turns H: we start at turn t1. Then we take actions for H turns? and then at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at the next state? \n\nBut the condition is on y_{t1+H-1}. \n\nPerhaps H is defined as the number of actions taken until we first reach y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis implies that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and at the beginning of that turn, we are at y=9. Then we take an action and move to y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as we have reached at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we take an action at that turn (which might move us away, but that's after we've already been at 9). \n\nHowever, that seems odd because we might leave immediately. But the problem only requires to reach at the beginning of that turn.\n\nBut note: the player must avoid collisions at every turn when on freeways 1-8. So at turn t1+H-1, if we are at y=9, then we are not on a freeway (because freeways are 1-8, and 9 is the goal). So no collision check at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  We are at turn t1+H-1: y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> safe (no freeway at y=9). Then we take an action (which might be S, U, or D) but it doesn't matter because we've already reached.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number such that we can get from y=2 at turn 2 to y=9 at turn 2+H-1 = 1+H? \n\nLet T = turn index. We start at turn 2 at y=2. We want to be at y=9 at turn T. The minimal T? Then H = T - 2 + 1? Because T = t1 + H - 1 -> 2 + H - 1 = T -> H = T - 1.\n\nBut we want minimal T? Then minimal H = T - 1? \n\nThe minimal T for which we can be at y=9 is at least 2 + (9-2) = 9? Because we start at turn2, and we need to cover 7 steps. So the earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn 2+7 = 9? \n\nBut note: at turn 2, we are at y=2. Then:\n  turn3: y=?\n  ...\n  turn9: y=?\n\nAt turn9, we can be at y=9 if we moved up every time from turn2 to turn8 (7 moves). Then at the beginning of turn9, we are at y=9.\n\nSo T=9 -> H = T - 2 + 1? Wait: \n  We are at turn2: we take an action at turn2 to go to turn3, then at turn3 we take an action ... until turn8 we take an action to go to turn9. Then at the beginning of turn9, we are at y=9. \n\nBut the condition is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n  t1+H-1 = 9 -> 2 + H - 1 = 9 -> H = 8.\n\nAnd the actions are taken at turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 -> 7 actions? But H=8? \n\nWait: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1+0} = a2\n  a_{t1+1} = a3\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} = a_{2+H-1}\n\nAnd we require that at the beginning of turn (2+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nBut at the beginning of turn (2+H-1), we are at 9. How did we get there? By the actions taken at the previous turns. Specifically, the last action that moved us was taken at turn (2+H-2). \n\nTo have the state at turn (2+H-1) be 9, we must have taken actions from turn2 to turn (2+H-2) (which is H-1 actions). \n\nBut the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turn2 to turn (2+H-1). \n\nBut then the state at turn (2+H) is determined by the last action at turn (2+H-1). \n\nSo the condition that at turn (2+H-1) we are at 9 is the state at the beginning of that turn. Then we take an action at turn (2+H-1) and then move. \n\nBut we don't require to stay at 9, only to have been there at the beginning of that turn. \n\nTherefore, to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T, we need T = 2 + H - 1 -> H = T - 1.\n\nThe minimal T is 9? Then H=8.\n\nBut we can try to see if we can get to y=9 earlier? \n\nWe start at y=2 at turn2. The minimal number of moves to go from 2 to 9 is 7 moves (each U). So the earliest turn we can be at y=9 is turn2+7 = turn9.\n\nTherefore, minimal T is 9, so H=8.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions on freeways 1-8. So we must ensure that at every turn from turn2 to turn8 (if we are on a freeway) we don't collide.\n\nAt turn2: we are at y=2 -> freeway2. We already checked: at turn2, freeway2 is safe.\n\nThen we take an action at turn2. We want to go up. So we plan to do U at turn2, then we will be at y=3 at turn3.\n\nAt turn3: we are at y=3 -> freeway3.\n\nWe must check freeway3 at turn3.\n\nFreeway3: one car: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nAt turn3: T=3, so T-t1 = 3-2=1.\nThe car: [tau + s*(1), head + s*(1)] = [-51+4, -40+4] = [-47, -36] -> doesn't cover 0. Safe.\n\nThen at turn3: we take U -> y4 at turn4.\n\nTurn4: y=4 -> freeway4.\n\nFreeway4: three cars: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\n\nAt turn4: T=4, T-t1=2.\nCar1: [-51+4*2, -40+4*2] = [-51+8, -40+8] = [-43, -32] -> doesn't cover 0.\nCar2: [-15+8, -4+8] = [-7,4] -> does 0 fall in [-7,4]? Yes, because -7<=0<=4. So collision!\n\nSo at turn4, if we are on freeway4, we collide with the second car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=4 at turn4.\n\nWe must avoid that. How? We can either:\n  a) Not be at y=4 at turn4 -> so we change our movement: maybe wait at y=3 for one turn? or go down? \n  b) Or change the timing so that we are at y=4 at a different turn.\n\nBut we are constrained by the minimal turns. We want to be at y=9 at turn9. So we must leave y=2 at turn2, then y=3 at turn3, then we must be at y=4 at some turn, but not turn4? \n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn3. Then if we do S at turn3, we stay at y=3 at turn4. Then at turn4 we are at y=3 (freeway3) and then we must check freeway3 at turn4.\n\nFreeway3 at turn4: T=4, T-t1=2 -> same as above? The car: [-51+4*2, -40+4*2] = [-43,-32] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn4 we are at y=3. Then at turn4 we can do U to go to y=4 at turn5.\n\nBut then at turn5, we are at y=4 (freeway4). Check freeway4 at turn5.\n\nT=5, T-t1=3.\nCar1: [-51+4*3, -40+4*3] = [-51+12, -40+12] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\nCar2: [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8] -> covers 0? Yes, because -3<=0<=8. So collision at turn5.\n\nAlternatively, if we wait two turns at y=3: \n  turn3: at y=3 -> safe.\n  turn3 action: S -> y3 at turn4.\n  turn4: at y=3 -> safe (as above).\n  turn4 action: S -> y3 at turn5? Then at turn5 we are still at y=3.\n\nThen at turn5 we do U -> y4 at turn6.\n\nThen at turn6: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn6: T=6, T-t1=4.\nCar1: [-51+16, -40+16] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\nCar2: [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\nCar3: [21+16, 32+16] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn6, freeway4 is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n  turn2: U -> y3 at turn3\n  turn3: S -> y3 at turn4\n  turn4: S -> y3 at turn5\n  turn5: U -> y4 at turn6\n\nBut then we are at y4 at turn6. We need to get to y9 at turn9? \n\nFrom turn6: y4 -> we need 5 more steps to y9: 4->5->6->7->8->9: 5 steps. Then we would be at y9 at turn6+5 = turn11. That is too late.\n\nBut we want minimal H, meaning we want to be at y9 as soon as possible. The earliest is turn9. But with the above, we are at turn6 at y4, then we need 5 more turns (actions at turn6,7,8,9,10) to get to y9 at turn11. Then H would be the number of actions from turn2 to turn10? That is 9 actions? Then H=9? But we could have been at turn9 at y9 if no obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster by not waiting so long? Or by going down and then up? \n\nBut note: we can only move one step per turn. So we must spend at least 7 moves (U) to go from 2 to 9. And we have to avoid the collision at freeway4 at turn4 and turn5? We saw that at turn4 and turn5, freeway4 is dangerous. What about turn6: we saw it's safe. What about turn7? \n\nWe want to be at y4 at a safe turn. We saw turn6 is safe. But then we are at y4 at turn6. Then we need to go from 4 to 9 in 3 turns? That's impossible because we need 5 steps. \n\nWe must be at y4 earlier. What about turn3? \n\nAt turn3: we are at y3. To be at y4 at turn4 we collide. So we must avoid turn4. What about being at y4 at turn5? We saw at turn5: freeway4: car2 covers 0 -> collision.\n\nTurn6: safe, as above.\n\nTurn7: T=7, T-t1=5.\nCar1: [-51+20, -40+20] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\nCar2: [-15+20, -4+20] = [5,16] -> safe (0 not in [5,16]).\nCar3: [21+20,32+20]=[41,52] -> safe.\n\nSo turn7 is safe too.\n\nBut we need to get to y9 at turn9. If we are at y4 at turn6, then we need 5 moves to get to y9 at turn11 -> too late.\n\nIf we are at y4 at turn7: then we need 5 moves -> at turn12.\n\nWe must find a way to get past freeway4 without waiting two turns? \n\nAlternatively, we can avoid freeway4 by going a different route? But we have to go through freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 to get to 9.\n\nAnother idea: go down? But we start at y=2. If we go down to y=1, then we have to go back up, which would take more turns.\n\nBut let's check freeway1 at various turns to see if we can use it to wait? \n\nFreeway1: three cars: \n  (-40,-51,right,4): at turn T: [-51+4*(T-2), -40+4*(T-2)]\n  (-4,-15,right,4): [-15+4*(T-2), -4+4*(T-2)]\n  (32,21,right,4): [21+4*(T-2), 32+4*(T-2)]\n\nWe need to avoid being at freeway1 when 0 is in any of these spans.\n\nLet me compute for T from 2 to 9:\n\nT=2:\n  car1: [-51, -40] -> safe\n  car2: [-15, -4] -> safe\n  car3: [21,32] -> safe\n\nT=3:\n  car1: [-47,-36] -> safe\n  car2: [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because -11<=0<=0. So collision.\n\nT=4:\n  car1: [-43,-32] -> safe\n  car2: [-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> collision.\n  car3: [29,40] -> safe\n\nT=5:\n  car1: [-39,-28] -> safe\n  car2: [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> collision.\n\nT=6:\n  car1: [-35,-24] -> safe\n  car2: [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n  car3: [37,48] -> safe\n\nT=7:\n  car1: [-31,-20] -> safe\n  car2: [5,16] -> safe\n  car3: [41,52] -> safe\n\nT=8:\n  car1: [-27,-16] -> safe\n  car2: [9,20] -> safe\n  car3: [45,56] -> safe\n\nT=9: similarly safe.\n\nSo freeway1 is only safe at T=2, then from T=6 onward. But we are at y=2 at T=2. If we go down to y=1 at turn3, then at turn3 we are at freeway1 -> collision (as at T=3, freeway1 is unsafe).\n\nSo we cannot go down to y=1 at turn3.\n\nWhat about waiting at y=2? \n\nAt turn2: we are at y=2. We can do S to stay at y=2 at turn3.\n\nThen at turn3: we are at freeway2. Check freeway2 at turn3.\n\nFreeway2: one car: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at turn3: T-t1=1, so [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn3 we can do U to go to y=3 at turn4.\n\nThen at turn4: freeway3 -> safe? We saw at turn4: freeway3 is safe (car: [-43,-32]).\n\nThen at turn4: we want to go to y=4, but at turn4 freeway4 is unsafe. So we cannot go to y=4 at turn4. We must wait at y=3 for one or two turns? \n\nAt turn4: we are at y=3 -> freeway3. Check freeway3 at turn4: safe.\n\nWe can do S at turn4 to stay at y=3 at turn5.\n\nThen at turn5: freeway3 at turn5: T=5, T-t1=3 -> car: [-51+12, -40+12] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\nBut if we do U at turn5, then at turn6 we are at y=4. And freeway4 at turn6: we saw it's safe.\n\nSo now we are at turn6 at y=4. Then we need to go from y=4 to y=9: 5 steps. So we would be at y=9 at turn11. But we want to be at turn9 at y=9? That's not possible.\n\nWe must find a way to be at y=4 earlier than turn6? But we saw that turn4 and turn5 are unsafe.\n\nWhat about being at y=4 at turn7? Then we can only get to y=9 at turn12.\n\nThat's too late. We want the minimal H, so we want to be at y=9 at turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must find a path that lets us be at y=4 at a safe turn and then move up quickly, but the safe turns for freeway4 are turn6,7,8,9,... and we need to be at y=9 at turn9.\n\nIf we are at y=4 at turn6, then we have turns 6,7,8 to move. We need to go from 4 to 9: 5 steps. We can only do 3 actions (at turn6,7,8) -> we can only move up 3 times, so we get to y=7 at turn9. Not enough.\n\nIf we are at y=4 at turn5: unsafe.\n\n turn5 is unsafe for freeway4.\n\nWhat about turn3? We can't be at y=4 at turn3 because at turn3 we are at y=3 (if we moved up at turn2).\n\nUnless we start by going down? Let me try:\n\nAt turn2: we are at y=2. We do D -> then at turn3, we are at y=1.\n\nBut at turn3, we are on freeway1 -> and we saw freeway1 at turn3 is unsafe. So collision.\n\nSo we cannot go down at turn2.\n\nWe can only go up or stay.\n\nAt turn2: U or S.\n\nIf we do S at turn2: then at turn3 we are at y=2 (freeway2). Check freeway2 at turn3: we did [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn3: we can do U to y=3 at turn4.\n\nThen at turn4: at y=3 (freeway3) -> safe.\n\nThen at turn4: we do U? then at turn5 we are at y=4 -> but freeway4 at turn5 is unsafe.\n\nSo we do S at turn4: then at turn5 at y=3 (freeway3) -> safe.\n\nThen at turn5: we do U -> y=4 at turn6.\n\nThen at turn6: freeway4 safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 at turn6. Then we need 5 moves to y9: we can do U at turn6->y5 at turn7, U at turn7->y6 at turn8, U at turn8->y7 at turn9. But we need to be at y9 at turn9, so we are only at y7 at turn9. Not enough.\n\nWe must be higher than y4 by turn6.\n\nWhat if we can skip freeway4 by moving faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that we might move down temporarily to avoid a car on freeway4, but then move up later. But moving down will cost turns.\n\nFor example, at turn4: we are at y=3. Instead of staying, we move down to y=2 at turn5.\n\nThen at turn5: freeway2 -> check at turn5: T=5, T-t1=3 -> car: [-59+12*3, -48+12*3] = [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn5: we are at y=2. Then at turn5 we can move up to y=3 at turn6.\n\nThen at turn6: freeway3 -> safe (car: [-51+4*(6-2)= -51+16=-35, -40+16=-24] -> safe).\n\nThen at turn6: move up to y=4 at turn7.\n\nThen at turn7: freeway4 -> safe (as computed above).\n\nBut then at turn7: we are at y=4. Then we need to get to y=9 by turn9? We have two actions: turn7 and turn8 -> we can only move up twice: to y=6 at turn9. Not enough.\n\nSo still not.\n\nWe see that we are delayed at freeway4. The only safe times for freeway4 are turn6 and later. But then we can't reach y9 by turn9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal turn for reaching y9 might be later than turn9.\n\nLet me try to find the earliest turn we can be at y9.\n\nWe must pass through y=4 at a safe turn. The safe turns for freeway4 are turn6,7,8,... \n\nIf we are at y=4 at turn6, then we need to go from 4 to 9: 5 steps -> requires 5 turns: so turn6,7,8,9,10 -> at turn10 we are at y=9? Then at the beginning of turn10, we are at y=9. So T=10, then H = T - 2 + 1? But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> 2+H-1=10 -> H=9.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=4 earlier? We saw turn4 and turn5 are unsafe. What about turn3? We can't be at y=4 at turn3 because at turn3 we would have come from turn2: we can only be at y=3 at turn3.\n\nUnless we start at a higher y? We start at y=2.\n\nWhat about being at y=4 at turn7? Then we need 5 steps -> turn7,8,9,10,11 -> T=11 for y=9 -> H=10.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the best we can do is to be at y=4 at turn6, then we go up every turn: \n  turn6: y=4 -> U -> y=5 at turn7\n  turn7: y=5 -> U -> y=6 at turn8\n  turn8: y=6 -> U -> y=7 at turn9\n  turn9: y=7 -> U -> y=8 at turn10\n  turn10: y=8 -> U -> y=9 at turn11\n\nBut then at turn11, we are at y=9. But we want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = H+1. Set equal to 11 -> H=10.\n\nBut at turn10, we are at y=8. We are not at y=9 until turn11.\n\nHowever, we can try to optimize the moves after freeway4.\n\nBut we have to go through freeway5,6,7,8 as well. Let's check if there are any obstacles on those freeways.\n\nFreeway5: cars: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4) -> same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway7: only one car: (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nFreeway8: only one car: (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nLet me check freeway5 at various turns:\n\nThe cars on freeway5 are the same as freeway4. So the safety at freeway5 is the same as freeway4? \n\nAt turn T, the car2: [-15+4*(T-2), -4+4*(T-2)] covers 0 when?\n  We had: \n    T=2: safe\n    T=3: [-15+4, -4+4] = [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> unsafe.\n    T=4: [-7,4] -> covers 0.\n    T=5: [-3,8] -> covers 0.\n    T=6: [1,12] -> safe.\n    T>=6: safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway6: same as freeway4 and 5.\n\nFreeway7: only car1: [-51+4*(T-2), -40+4*(T-2)]\n  This car covers 0 when: -51+4*(T-2) <= 0 <= -40+4*(T-2)\n  Solve: \n    -51+4*(T-2) <= 0 -> 4*(T-2) <= 51 -> T-2 <= 12.75 -> T<=14.75 -> always true for our range?\n    and 0 <= -40+4*(T-2) -> 40 <= 4*(T-2) -> 10 <= T-2 -> T>=12.\n\n  So for T<12, the car is at left of 0. At T=12: [-51+4*10, -40+40] = [-51+40,0] = [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n  T=13: [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4] -> covers 0.\n  T=14: [-3,8] -> covers 0.\n  T=15: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut we are planning to be at freeway7 around turn7 or 8? Let's see our schedule:\n\nIf we are at y=4 at turn6, then:\n  turn6: y=4\n  turn7: y=5 (freeway5) -> must be safe: at T=7, freeway5: safe (as above, T=7>=6)\n  turn8: y=6 (freeway6) -> T=8: safe.\n  turn9: y=7 (freeway7) -> T=9: freeway7: \n        car: [-51+4*(9-2) = -51+28 = -23, -40+28=-12] -> doesn't cover 0 -> safe.\n  turn10: y=8 (freeway8) -> T=10: freeway8: \n        car: [-51+4*8 = -51+32=-19, -40+32=-8] -> safe.\n  turn11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo it works. But we reach y=9 at turn11.\n\nThen at the beginning of turn11, we are at y=9. So we require y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> 2+H-1=11 -> H=10.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in fewer than 10 turns?\n\nWe must be at y=4 at turn6 at the earliest. Then from turn6 to turn11 is 5 turns for 5 moves. That's minimal.\n\nBut can we be at y=4 before turn6? Only if we can avoid the collision at turn4 and turn5. We saw that freeway4 is unsafe at turn4 and turn5.\n\nWhat if we move up faster initially? We can't because we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr, we can skip freeway4 by being at a different freeway at the dangerous turns? But we have to go through freeway4.\n\nAnother idea: go from y=3 to y=5 in one move? But we can't, only one step per turn.\n\nOr, use a different freeway by moving down and up? For example, at turn4: we are at y=3. Instead of waiting, we go down to y=2 at turn5, then at turn5 we go up to y=3 at turn6, then at turn6 we go up to y=4 at turn7. But then we are at y=4 at turn7, which is later than turn6.\n\nSo turn6 is the earliest.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, meaning we take 10 actions from turn2 to turn11? But wait, we only need to be at y=9 at turn11, so the last action is at turn10.\n\nActions:\n  turn2, turn3, turn4, turn5, turn6, turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10 -> 9 actions? \n\nBut H=10? \n\nRecall: H is the number of actions. The sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so 10 actions: at turn2 to turn11? But turn2 + 10 - 1 = turn11. Then the state at turn2+H-1 = turn2+9? = turn11. And we want y_{11}=9.\n\nBut we have 10 actions: from turn2 to turn11? That would be actions at turn2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 10 actions. Then after the last action (at turn11), we are at turn12. But we want to be at y=9 at turn11.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n  Action at turn2: determines y3.\n  Action at turn3: determines y4.\n  ...\n  Action at turn10: determines y11.\n  Action at turn11: determines y12.\n\nBut we want y11=9. So the action at turn10 should move us to y11=9.\n\nTherefore, the actions are from turn2 to turn10 (9 actions) to reach y11=9.\n\nThen the number of actions H should be 9, and then 2+H-1 = 2+8 = 10? But we want y_{2+H-1}=y_{10}=9? But then at turn10 we are at 9, and then we take an action at turn10 and move to y11. \n\nThe problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nIf H=9, then t1+H-1 = 2+8=10. So we want y_{10}=9.\n\nBut in the above plan, we are at y9 at turn11, not turn10.\n\nSo we need to be at y9 at turn10.\n\nHow can we achieve that? We need to cover 7 steps in 8 turns? (from turn2 to turn10: 8 turns? from turn2 to turn10 is 8 state changes: \n  turn2: y2=2\n  turn3: y3\n  ...\n  turn10: y10\n\nSo we need to go from 2 to 9 in 8 steps. We can do it if there are no delays. But we have delays.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn2.\n turn3: y=3\n turn4: we cannot be at y=4, so we must wait at y=3 for two turns? Then at turn6: y=4.\n Then from turn6 to turn10: 4 turns to go from 4 to 9: that's 5 steps, so we need to do 5 moves in 4 turns? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=9 at turn10. The earliest is turn11.\n\nSo then we want y_{11}=9. Then 2+H-1=11 -> H=10.\n\nAnd we take 10 actions: at turn2, turn3, ..., turn11.\n\nThen the action at turn11 will determine y12, but we don't care as long as at the beginning of turn11 we are at 9.\n\nBut note: at turn11, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check. Then we can do any action.\n\nNow, let's plan the actions:\n\nWe must avoid the collision at freeway4 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nWe are at:\n  turn2: y=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n    action: U -> y=3 at turn3.\n\n  turn3: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n    action: S -> stay at y=3 for turn4.\n\n  turn4: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n    action: S -> stay at y=3 for turn5.\n\n  turn5: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n    action: U -> y=4 at turn6.\n\n  turn6: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (as computed).\n    action: U -> y=5 at turn7.\n\n  turn7: y=5 -> freeway5: at T=7, safe.\n    action: U -> y=6 at turn8.\n\n  turn8: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n    action: U -> y=7 at turn9.\n\n  turn9: y=7 -> freeway7: at T=9: car is [-51+28, -40+28] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n    action: U -> y=8 at turn10.\n\n  turn10: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=10: car is [-51+32, -40+32] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n    action: U -> y=9 at turn11.\n\nThen at the beginning of turn11, we are at y=9.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: S\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n\nTotal actions: 9 actions? But we have from turn2 to turn10: 9 actions. But H=10? \n\nWe want H=10 actions? Then we need one more. But we are at y=9 at turn11, and we have to take an action at turn11. We can take any action, say S.\n\nBut the problem only requires that at the beginning of turn11 we are at 9, and then we take an action at turn11.\n\nSo the sequence should include turn11.\n\nTherefore, we add:\n\n  turn11: S (or U or D, but we are at y=9, if we do U we go to 10 which is invalid? So we must do S or D. But D would go to 8, which is not desired, but the goal is already achieved at the beginning of turn11. So we can do S.\n\nSo the actions are 10 actions:\n\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: S\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: S\n\nBut then after turn11 action (S), we are at y=9 at turn12. But we are only required to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn11, and then we take an action at turn11 which moves us to turn12. The goal is achieved at turn11, so the action at turn11 is just to satisfy the sequence length.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then we stop. But the format requires exactly H actions. And we must reach at the turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, at the beginning of turn11 (which is t1+H-1 = 2+10-1=11), we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at turn11. That action doesn't affect the reaching at turn11.\n\nSo it is acceptable.\n\nBut is there a way to do it without the extra action? \n\nThe minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that at the beginning of turn (2+H-1) we are at 9. \n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn (H+1). And we can be there at turn11, so H+1=11 -> H=10.\n\nTherefore, we must take 10 actions.\n\nBut in the above, we are at y=9 at turn11 by the action at turn10. Then we take an action at turn11 which is not necessary for reaching, but we have to include it to have 10 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we could have taken a different path that reaches at turn11 with exactly 10 actions and without the extra action? But we have to cover 7 steps, and we had to wait 2 turns, so total moves: 7 U and 2 S, and then one extra action at the end? That's 10 actions.\n\nWe can avoid the extra action by not moving at the last step? But we have to take 10 actions.\n\nSo the plan is as above.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision at every step:\n\nturn2: y=2 -> freeway2: car: (-48,-59,right,12) at turn2: [-59,-48] -> safe. Action: U -> y3 at turn3.\n\nturn3: y=3 -> freeway3: car: (-40,-51,right,4) -> at turn3: [-51+4, -40+4]=[-47,-36] -> safe. Action: S -> y3 at turn4.\n\nturn4: y=3 -> freeway3: at turn4: [-51+8, -40+8]=[-43,-32] -> safe. Action: S -> y3 at turn5.\n\nturn5: y=3 -> freeway3: at turn5: [-51+12, -40+12]=[-39,-28] -> safe. Action: U -> y4 at turn6.\n\nturn6: y=4 -> freeway4: \n  car1: [-51+16, -40+16]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n  car2: [-15+16, -4+16]=[1,12] -> safe.\n  car3: [21+16,32+16]=[37,48] -> safe.\n  Action: U -> y5 at turn7.\n\nturn7: y=5 -> freeway5: \n  car1: [-51+20, -40+20]=[-31,-20] -> safe.\n  car2: [-15+20, -4+20]=[5,16] -> safe.\n  car3: [21+20,32+20]=[41,52] -> safe.\n  Action: U -> y6 at turn8.\n\nturn8: y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway4 and 5, at T=8: \n  car1: [-51+24, -40+24]=[-27,-16] -> safe.\n  car2: [-15+24, -4+24]=[9,20] -> safe.\n  car3: [21+24,32+24]=[45,56] -> safe.\n  Action: U -> y7 at turn9.\n\nturn9: y=7 -> freeway7: car: (-40,-51,right,4) -> at turn9: [-51+28, -40+28]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n  Action: U -> y8 at turn10.\n\nturn10: y=8 -> freeway8: car: (-40,-51,right,4) -> at turn10: [-51+32, -40+32]=[-19,-8] -> safe.\n  Action: U -> y9 at turn11.\n\nBut wait, we are at turn10: we do U and then at turn11 we are at y9. But the condition for turn10: we are at y=8 (freeway8) and it's safe. Then after the action, we are at y9 at turn11.\n\nBut the goal is to be at y9 at the beginning of turn11. So at the beginning of turn11, we are at y9. Then we take an action at turn11? But in the above, we haven't taken an action at turn11 yet.\n\nWe have taken 9 actions: from turn2 to turn10. But we need 10 actions. So we must take an action at turn11.\n\nAt turn11: we are at y9. Then we take an action, say S. Then we move to y9 at turn12. But we don't care.\n\nSo the full sequence:\n\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: S\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U   -> this gets us to y9 at turn11.\n  turn11: S   -> then we stay at y9 for turn12.\n\nBut note: at turn11, we are at y9 -> not a freeway, so no collision check. Then we do S and stay.\n\nSo the answer should be 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 actions? Then we would be at y9 at turn10 (because 2+9-1=10). But we cannot because of the delays.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=2, so we start at turn2.\n\nIn the sequence, we have from turn2 to turn11, which is 10 turns.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway at turn10 for y=8: we did, safe.\n\nAnd freeway7 at turn9: safe.\n\nAlso, note freeway5,6: at turn7 and 8: we checked.\n\nWhat about freeway1 to 8 at the turns we are there: we have covered.\n\nOne more: at turn11, we are at y=9, so no freeway.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions must ensure that at the beginning of turn \\(2 + H - 1 = 11\\), the player is at \\(y = 9\\). The actions are chosen to avoid collisions at each turn:\n\n- **Turn 2:** The player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). The car on freeway 2 at turn 2 is at \\([-59, -48]\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 3.\n- **Turn 3:** The player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). The car on freeway 3 at turn 3 is at \\([-47, -36]\\) (safe). Action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 4.\n- **Turn 4:** The player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). The car on freeway 3 at turn 4 is at \\([-43, -32]\\) (safe). Action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 5.\n- **Turn 5:** The player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). The car on freeway 3 at turn 5 is at \\([-39, -28]\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6.\n- **Turn 6:** The player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). The cars on freeway 4 at turn 6 are:\n  - \\([-35, -24]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), \\([37, 48]\\) (all safe, as 0 is not covered). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n- **Turn 7:** The player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). The cars on freeway 5 at turn 7 are:\n  - \\([-31, -20]\\), \\([5, 16]\\), \\([41, 52]\\) (all safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n- **Turn 8:** The player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). The cars on freeway 6 at turn 8 are:\n  - \\([-27, -16]\\), \\([9, 20]\\), \\([45, 56]\\) (all safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9:** The player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). The car on freeway 7 at turn 9 is at \\([-23, -12]\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10:** The player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). The car on freeway 8 at turn 10 is at \\([-19, -8]\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11:** The player is at \\(y = 9\\) (goal, no freeway). Action \\(S\\) is taken to satisfy the sequence length, but it does not affect the goal achievement at the beginning of turn 11.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 11 (i.e., \\(y_{11} = 9\\)) with \\(H = 10\\) actions, and no collisions occur.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: S \\\\\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I'm at y=3. Actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move right with given speeds, and I collide only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y where for some car, 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant point: when I move to a new y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. Collision is checked based on where I am at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=4. I need actions for t=4,5,6,... up to some H where y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn for each freeway.\n\nAll cars are moving right, so their spans shift to the right over time.\n\nFor a car with head h, tail τ, direction right, speed s, at time T (relative to t_1=4), the span is [τ + s(T), h + s(T)] since it's moving right.\n\nLet’s define T as the number of turns after t_1. So at T=0, it's turn t_1=4.\n\nFor a car, at absolute time t, but since we start from t_1, let’s use Δt = t - t_1.\n\nSo for a car given at Δt=0, with span [head, tail] or [h, τ], but in the table, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right, head > tail I think, since it moves right.\n\nLook at the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: cars: (-32, -43, right, 4), (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4)\n\n-32 and -43, -32 > -43, so head is -32, tail is -43? But that would mean the car is from -43 to -32, which is length 11, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, (4, -7): 4 > -7, so tail -7, head 4, span [-7,4] at Δt=0.\n\nBut -7 to 4 is 11 units, same as others? -43 to -32 is 11, -7 to 4 is 11, 29 to 40 is 11? 40-29=11, yes all same length.\n\nSpeed 4 for all.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) so tail -35, head -24, span [-35,-24], length 11, speed 12.\n\nFreeway 3: (-32, -43, right, 4) same as above.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1, three cars.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, others have one or three.\n\nFreeway 2 has only one car.\n\nFreeway 3 has one car.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 have three each.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have one each.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T (absolute or relative?), let's use relative time.\n\nSet t = t_1 + Δt, so at Δt=0, it's turn t_1=4.\n\nAt relative time Δt, for a car on freeway k, the span is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] for right-moving.\n\nThen, collision occurs at time Δt if I am on freeway y at that time, and for some car on y, 0 is in [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt].\n\nSince the car is on freeway y, and I am on y at time Δt.\n\nThe condition is: if 0 ∈ [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] for that car.\n\nNow, [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] is the interval, and we need 0 to be inside it.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, and spans are increasing.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid cars.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, from y=3 to y=9, minimum turns is 6, if I go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 3 to 9 in 6 turns.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, I should check for each freeway and each future time, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the collision depends on whether 0 is in the car's span at that exact time.\n\nFor each freeway and each Δt, I need to see if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at Δt.\n\nThen, if I am on that freeway at time Δt, I collide.\n\nI need to plan a path through y-levels over time.\n\nSince x-position is always 0, only y changes.\n\nLet me make a table for each freeway, for each Δt, whether x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars:\n\nCar A: (h=-32, τ=-43, d=right, s=4) so span at Δt: [ -43 + 4*Δt, -32 + 4*Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -43 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 4Δt\n\nSimilarly, car B: (h=4, τ=-7, s=4) span [ -7 + 4Δt, 4 + 4Δt ]\n\n0 in [ -7 + 4Δt, 4 + 4Δt ] if -7 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 4 + 4Δt\n\nCar C: (h=40, τ=29, s=4) span [29 + 4Δt, 40 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in this? 29 + 4Δt ≥ 29 >0, so 0 < 29 + 4Δt, and 0 < 40 + 4Δt, but 0 is less than lower bound, so never in span since lower bound at least 29>0. So car C never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for car A: 0 in [ -43 + 4Δt, -32 + 4Δt ]\n\nSo -43 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 4Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -43 + 4Δt ≤ 0 => 4Δt ≤ 43 => Δt ≤ 43/4 = 10.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -32 + 4Δt => 4Δt ≥ 32 => Δt ≥ 8\n\nSo for 8 ≤ Δt ≤ 10.75, since Δt integer, Δt=8,9,10\n\nΔt=8: -43 + 32 = -11 ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 32 =0, 0 ≤ 0 true, so yes\n\nΔt=9: -43+36= -7 ≤0 ≤ -32+36=4, 0≤4 true\n\nΔt=10: -43+40= -3 ≤0 ≤ -32+40=8, true\n\nΔt=11: -43+44=1 ≤0? 1 ≤0 false, and 0 ≤ -32+44=12, but first inequality false, so no.\n\nSimilarly, car B: 0 in [ -7 + 4Δt, 4 + 4Δt ]\n\n-7 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 4 + 4Δt\n\nFirst: -7 +4Δt ≤0 => 4Δt ≤7 => Δt ≤ 7/4=1.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 4 + 4Δt always true since 4+4Δt ≥4>0\n\nSo only first inequality: Δt ≤1.75, so for integer Δt=0,1\n\nΔt=0: -7 +0 = -7 ≤0 ≤4, true\n\nΔt=1: -7+4= -3 ≤0 ≤4+4=8, true\n\nΔt=2: -7+8=1 ≤0? false, so no.\n\nCar C never, as above.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied when:\n\nAt Δt=0: car B covers, since [ -7,4] contains 0\n\nΔt=1: car B covers, [ -3,8] contains 0\n\nΔt=2: no car covers? Car A at [ -43, -32] both negative, 0 not in, car B [1,8] 0 not in, car C [29,40] no. So free at Δt=2.\n\nBut we need to check all.\n\nAt Δt=0: car B active, so occupied.\n\nΔt=1: car B active, occupied.\n\nΔt=2: no car, free.\n\nΔt=3: car A [ -43+12= -31, -32+12= -20] both negative, no; car B [ -7+12=5, 4+12=16] both positive, 0 not in; car C [29+12=41,40+12=52] no. Free.\n\nΔt=4: similar, car A [ -43+16=-27, -32+16=-16] no; car B [ -7+16=9,4+16=20] no; car C [29+16=45,40+16=56] no. Free.\n\n...\n\nUp to Δt=7: car A [ -43+28= -15, -32+28= -4] both negative, no; car B [ -7+28=21,4+28=32] no; car C [29+28=57,40+28=68] no. Free.\n\nΔt=8: car A [ -43+32= -11, -32+32=0], 0 in [-11,0], yes, since 0≤0.\n\nOccupied.\n\nΔt=9: car A [ -43+36= -7, -32+36=4], 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nΔt=10: car A [ -43+40= -3, -32+40=8], 0 in [-3,8], yes.\n\nΔt=11: car A [ -43+44=1, -32+44=12], 1>0, 0 not in [1,12]; others no. Free.\n\nΔt=12 and above: car A lower bound increases, never again.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (-24, -35, right, 12) so head -24? In the table it's (head, tail) but for right, head should be larger? (-24, -35), -24 > -35, so tail -35, head -24, span [ -35, -24] at Δt=0.\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -35 + 12Δt, -24 + 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 12Δt => 12Δt ≥ 24 => Δt ≥ 2\n\nSo for Δt=2, since 2 ≤ Δt ≤ 2.916\n\nΔt=2: -35+24= -11 ≤0 ≤ -24+24=0, 0≤0 true, yes.\n\nΔt=3: -35+36=1 ≤0? false, and 0 ≤ -24+36=12 true, but first false, so no.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, freeway 2 is occupied.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car (-32, -43, right, 4) same as car A on freeway 1.\n\nSpan [ -43 +4Δt, -32 +4Δt]\n\n0 in if -43+4Δt ≤0 ≤ -32+4Δt\n\nΔt ≥8 and Δt ≤10.75, so Δt=8,9,10 occupied, same as freeway 1 car A.\n\nAt other times free.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1, three cars, so occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same, occupied Δt=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nFreeway 6: same, occupied Δt=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nFreeway 7: one car (-32, -43, right, 4), same as above, occupied Δt=8,9,10.\n\nFreeway 8: one car same, occupied Δt=8,9,10.\n\nNow freeway 2 is different, only occupied at Δt=2.\n\nI am starting at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, freeway 3 is occupied? Freeway 3 has car, occupied at Δt=8,9,10, but at Δt=0?\n\nFreeway 3: car only at Δt=8,9,10, so at Δt=0, free.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 occupied at 0,1,8,9,10; so at Δt=0, occupied.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nFreeway y=3 is free at Δt=0, since only occupied at 8,9,10.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nSo at Δt=0, I am on y=3.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, which is free at Δt=0 (since occupied only at 8,9,10).\n\nBut collision only if I am on y and y is occupied at that time.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=3 is free, so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is not on freeway, so no collision possible there.\n\nI start at (0,3), which is on freeway 3.\n\nNow, I need a sequence of actions.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go up each time, y=3 to y=4 at turn Δt=1, then to y=5 at Δt=2, and so on, to y=9 at Δt=6.\n\nBut I need to check for each step if I collide.\n\nLet's see the occupancy for each y at each Δt.\n\nMake a grid: time Δt from 0 to say 12, y from 1 to 8.\n\nOccupied if:\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=2: freeway 2, occupied at Δt=2\n\ny=3: freeway 3, occupied at Δt=8,9,10\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=7: freeway 7, occupied at Δt=8,9,10\n\ny=8: freeway 8, occupied at Δt=8,9,10\n\nAnd at Δt not listed, free.\n\nNow, I start at Δt=0, y=3.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=3 is free, as above.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some Δt, but y=9 is always safe.\n\nThe position at turn T is where I am during that turn.\n\nLet me define the state.\n\nAt the beginning of turn Δt, I am at position y_{Δt}, then I choose action, which determines y_{Δt+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn based on y at that turn.\n\nAt turn Δt, I am on y_{Δt}, and if that y is between 1 and 8, and occupied at Δt, I collide.\n\nThen after action, I move to y_{Δt+1} for the next turn.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and since no cars, it's fine.\n\nMinimal Δt to reach y=9 from y=3 is 6 turns, arriving at Δt=6.\n\nBut I need to go through intermediate y.\n\nNow, for Δt=0: I am at y=3, which is free (since y=3 occupied only at 8,9,10), so safe.\n\nI can choose action for next position.\n\nI want to go up as much as possible.\n\nSuppose I go U at Δt=0, so at Δt=1, I am at y=4.\n\nBut at Δt=1, if I am on y=4, I need to check if y=4 is occupied at Δt=1.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10. So at Δt=1, occupied.\n\nIf I am at y=4 at Δt=1, I collide.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=4 at Δt=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I go S at Δt=0, I stay at y=3 at Δt=1.\n\nAt Δt=1, y=3 is still free, since occupied only at 8,9,10.\n\nIf I go D, to y=2 at Δt=1, but y=2 might be occupied.\n\nFirst, let's see possible paths.\n\nI need to avoid being on occupied y at critical times.\n\nList the dangerous times:\n\nFor each y, when it is occupied.\n\ny=1: occ at 0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=2: occ at 2\n\ny=3: occ at 8,9,10\n\ny=4: occ at 0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=5: occ at 0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=6: occ at 0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=7: occ at 8,9,10\n\ny=8: occ at 8,9,10\n\nAnd free otherwise.\n\nI start at Δt=0, y=3, free.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe critical periods are around Δt=0,1 and Δt=8,9,10 for most y.\n\nSince I start at Δt=0, and Δt=0,1 are dangerous for y=4,5,6, etc.\n\nBut I am at y=3, which is safe at Δt=0 and 1.\n\nAt Δt=0, after action, I move to next y for Δt=1.\n\nPossible actions at Δt=0:\n\n- U: go to y=4 at Δt=1. But y=4 at Δt=1 is occupied, so if I do this, at turn Δt=1, I am on y=4, which is occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\n- D: go to y=2 at Δt=1. Now, y=2 at Δt=1: is it occupied? y=2 occupied only at Δt=2, so at Δt=1, y=2 is free. So possible.\n\n- S: stay at y=3 at Δt=1, which is free.\n\nSo at Δt=0, I cannot go U, but can go D or S.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf I go S at Δt=0, I stay at y=3 at Δt=1.\n\nThen at Δt=1, I can choose action.\n\nAt Δt=1, I am at y=3 (if I stayed), which is free.\n\nThen I can go U to y=4 at Δt=2.\n\nBut at Δt=2, y=4: is it occupied? y=4 occupied at 0,1,8,9,10, not at 2. So free.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone D at Δt=0, to y=2 at Δt=1, which is free, then at Δt=1 I can go U to y=3 or something.\n\nBut let's think about reaching higher y.\n\nSince y=4,5,6 are occupied at Δt=0 and 1, I cannot be on them at those times.\n\nBut at Δt=2, they are free, until Δt=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 are free until Δt=8.\n\nSo I can move up after Δt=1.\n\nMinimal time: if I can be at y=4 at Δt=2, then to y=5 at Δt=3, ..., to y=9 at Δt=7? From y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, but depending on start.\n\nAt Δt=0, I am at y=3.\n\nAfter action at Δt=0, I go to y_{Δt=1}.\n\nThen at Δt=1, action to y_{Δt=2}, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 at some Δt, say at turn Δt, y_{Δt}=9.\n\nNumber of turns H is the number of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and at turn t_1+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, I perform action a_{t_1+t}, which determines the position for the next turn.\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + t, I am at position y_T, and I perform action a_T, then at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T between 1 and 8 and occupied at time T.\n\nFor T = t_1 + Δt, with Δt=0,1,2,...\n\nIn terms of relative time, at relative time Δt, I am at y_{Δt}.\n\nThen I perform action a_{Δt}, go to y_{Δt+1}.\n\nCollision at Δt if y_{Δt} in 1-8 and occupied at Δt.\n\nI start at Δt=0, y=3.\n\nI need y_{H} =9 for some H, meaning at turn Δt=H, I am at y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns after start, so at Δt=H, I am at position after H actions.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nSet relative time:\n\nAt time Δt (turn index), for Δt=0: turn t_1, position y=3.\n\nAfter action a_0, at time Δt=1, position y_1, and so on.\n\nAt each time Δt, I am at position y_t (for simplicity, y_t at time t).\n\nCollision at time t if y_t in 1-8 and occupied at time t.\n\nI need to find min H such that at time H, y_H =9, and no collision at times t=0 to H-1? At time H, if y_H=9, not on freeway, no collision.\n\nCollision only when on freeway, so at times when y_t in 1-8.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, if y_t in 1-8, need not occupied at t.\n\nAt time H, y_H=9, safe.\n\nNow, from y=3 to y=9, min H=6, with y_t increasing from 3 to 9 in 6 steps.\n\nBut let's see if possible with H=6.\n\ny_0 =3\n\ny_1 = ? after action a_0\n\ny_2, ..., y_6=9\n\nActions: each action changes y by -1,0,1, so after 6 actions, y_6 = y_0 + sum of Δy, from t=0 to 5, since action at t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t: determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after action at t, next position y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y_H =9, it means after H actions, at time H, position 9.\n\nFor example, start at t=0, y_0=3.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAfter a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1}\n\nAnd y_H=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1.\n\nNumber of actions H.\n\nCollision at times t where y_t in 1-8 and occupied at t.\n\nFor min H, H=6, so y_6=9.\n\ny_0=3\n\nThen y_6 = y_0 + sum_{k=0 to5} Δy_k =3 + sum =9, so sum Δy =6, so I need exactly +6, so all U actions, no S or D.\n\nSo only possible with a_t = U for t=0 to5, then y_t =3 + t for t=0 to6.\n\ny_0=3, a_0=U, y_1=4\n\na_1=U, y_2=5\n\na_2=U, y_3=6\n\na_3=U, y_4=7\n\na_4=U, y_5=8\n\na_5=U, y_6=9\n\nNow, check collision at each t from 0 to 5, since y_6=9 safe.\n\nt=0: y_0=3, in 1-8, occupied? y=3 at t=0: free, as before. Safe.\n\nt=1: y_1=4, in 1-8, occupied at t=1? y=4 occupied at t=1, yes, since freeway 4 occ at Δt=1. So collision at t=1.\n\nNot possible.\n\nThus, with all U, I collide at t=1.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=4 at t=1 or other occupied times.\n\nIn this path, at t=1, y=4 is occupied.\n\nI could stay or go down at first.\n\nFor example, at t=0, instead of U, I go S or D.\n\nIf go S at t=0: a_0=S, then y_1=3 (since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, if S, Δy=0, so y_1=y_0=3)\n\nThen at t=1, I am at y_1=3.\n\ny=3 at t=1: is it occupied? y=3 occupied only at t=8,9,10, not at t=1, so free. Safe.\n\nThen at t=1, I can go U to y=4 at t=2? Action at t=1: if U, then y_2 = y_1 +1 =4\n\ny_2 is position at time t=2.\n\nAt time t=2, y_2=4.\n\nNow, y=4 at t=2: occupied? y=4 occ at 0,1,8,9,10, not at t=2, so free. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut I started with S, so I lost one turn.\n\ny_0=3\n\na_0=S, y_1=3\n\na_1=U, y_2=4\n\na_2=U, y_3=5\n\na_3=U, y_4=6\n\na_4=U, y_5=7\n\na_5=U, y_6=8\n\na_6=U, y_7=9\n\nNow y_7=9 at t=7.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nCheck collisions:\n\nt=0: y_0=3, free, safe\n\nt=1: y_1=3, free, safe\n\nt=2: y_2=4, free (since occ only 0,1,8,9,10), safe\n\nt=3: y_3=5, y=5 occ at 0,1,8,9,10, not t=3, free, safe\n\nt=4: y_4=6, similarly free, safe\n\nt=5: y_5=7, y=7 occ only at 8,9,10, not t=5, free, safe\n\nt=6: y_6=8, y=8 occ only at 8,9,10, so at t=6, not occ, free? t=6 is before 8, so free, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=9, safe.\n\nSo this works with H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6?\n\nWith H=6, I need to reach y=9 in 6 actions, so sum Δy=6, all U.\n\nBut earlier, if I go U at t=0, y_1=4, which at t=1 is occupied.\n\nUnless I can be on a different y at t=1.\n\nBut with all U, I must be at y=4 at t=1.\n\nI could go down first.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go D to y=2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y_1=2.\n\nNow, y=2 at t=1: occupied? y=2 occupied only at t=2, so at t=1, free. Safe.\n\nThen at t=1, I can go U to y=3 at t=2? Action at t=1: U, then y_2 = y_1 +1 =2+1=3\n\ny_2=3 at t=2.\n\nThen I need to go up to y=9 in the remaining actions.\n\nFrom t=2, y_2=3, to y_6=9, I need to increase by 6 in 4 actions? From t=2 to t=6, that's 4 steps: y_2 to y_3, y_4, y_5, y_6.\n\ny_2=3, y_6=9, so need to increase by 6 in 4 steps, which requires average +1.5, but since integer, possible only if all U, but +4 in 4 steps, to y_6=7, not 9.\n\ny_2=3 at t=2.\n\nAfter action at t=2, y_3\n\nAt t=3, y_3\n\n...\n\nAt t=6, y_6\n\nNumber of actions from t=2 to t=5, 4 actions, to go from y_2=3 to y_6=9, need Δy=6 over 4 actions, impossible since each action max +1, so max y_6 = y_2 +4 =7, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf I start from y_2=3, after 4 actions, y_6 = y_2 + sum_{k=2 to5} Δy_k ≤ 3+4=7 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=6 if I go down first.\n\nIf I go down and then up faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFor example, from y_0=3, a_0=D, y_1=2\n\na_1=U, y_2=3 (as above)\n\nBut y_2=3 at t=2, same as before.\n\nThen I need to go to y_6=9, impossible in 4 steps.\n\nPerhaps go up later, but with H=6, I need to be at y=9 at t=6.\n\ny_0=3\n\nIf I go U at some points, but to have y_6=9, since y_0=3, I need exactly +6 from actions, so all actions must be U, no choice.\n\nTherefore, with H=6, only possible with all U, but that causes collision at t=1.\n\nThus, H=6 impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 7.\n\nWith H=7, as above, with one S at start, then U all the way.\n\nIn the sequence I had: a_0=S, y_1=3\n\na_1=U, y_2=4\n\na_2=U, y_3=5\n\na_3=U, y_4=6\n\na_4=U, y_5=7\n\na_5=U, y_6=8\n\na_6=U, y_7=9\n\nH=7 actions, from t=0 to t=6.\n\nAt t=7, y=9.\n\nCollisions: as before, all safe.\n\nBut I need to check for later times? t=0 to t=6.\n\nt=6: y_6=8, at time t=6, is y=8 occupied?\n\ny=8 occupied at t=8,9,10, not at t=6, so free.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: y_5=7, occupied at 8,9,10, not 5, free.\n\nt=4: y_4=6, free at t=4.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7 but different sequence?\n\nPerhaps I can go faster in some parts.\n\nBut since I need to go from 3 to 9, 6 steps, but with one delay, H=7 is minimal.\n\nWith H=7, I have one S or D, but in this case S at start.\n\nI could go U later, but I have to cover the distance.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, go D to y=2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, go U to y=3 at t=2.\n\nThen same as before, y_2=3, then to y=9 at t=8 or something, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, y_0=3, a_0=D, y_1=2\n\nt=0: y_0=3, safe\n\nt=1: y_1=2, now y=2 at t=1: occupied? y=2 occ at t=2, not t=1, so safe.\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=3\n\nt=2: y_2=3, safe? y=3 occ at t=8,9,10, not t=2, safe.\n\nThen from y_2=3, I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go all U: a_2=U, y_3=4\n\na_3=U, y_4=5\n\na_4=U, y_5=6\n\na_5=U, y_6=7\n\na_6=U, y_7=8\n\na_7=U, y_8=9\n\nNow y_8=9 at t=8, so H=8 actions, more than 7.\n\nWorse.\n\nTo reach faster, but from y_2=3, to y=9 in 6 steps? y_9=9 at t=9, even later.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence with S at start and then U all is better.\n\nBut in that sequence, I have a_0=S, which is stay, so I lose time at start.\n\nI could go up at t=0 to a different y.\n\nBut y=4 at t=1 is occupied, so I cannot go to y=4 at t=1.\n\nWhat about going to y=5 or something? No, I can only go to adjacent y.\n\nAt t=0, if I go U, I go to y=4 at t=1, which is occupied.\n\nUnless I go to y=4 at a different time.\n\nBut with immediate up, it's at t=1.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to avoid, but that might take longer.\n\nAnother thought: since y=2 is only occupied at t=2, I can be there at other times.\n\nBut in the path to up, not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by going through less occupied areas.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9, I have to go through 4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4,5,6 are occupied at t=0,1 and t=8,9,10, but free in between.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWith H=7, I can be at y=4 at t=2, which is free, then up to y=9 at t=7.\n\nIn the sequence: start at t=0, y=3, safe.\n\na_0=S, y_1=3 at t=1, safe.\n\na_1=U, y_2=4 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=5 at t=3, safe.\n\na_3=U, y_4=6 at t=4, safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=7 at t=5, safe.\n\na_5=U, y_6=8 at t=6, safe.\n\na_6=U, y_7=9 at t=7.\n\nGood.\n\nI could go directly from y=3 to y=4 at t=2, but I need to be at y=3 at t=1 or something.\n\nAt t=0, if I go D to y=2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=2, which is free at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, I can go U to y=3 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2 is occupied? y=2 at t=2: occupied, yes.\n\nIf I am at y=2 at t=2, I collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this case: a_0=D, y_1=2\n\nAt t=1, position y=2, which is free, safe.\n\nThen action a_1: I need to move.\n\nIf I go U, to y=3 at t=2? a_1=U, y_2 = y_1 +1 =2+1=3\n\ny_2=3 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2 is occupied, but I am not on y=2 at t=2, I am on y=3 at t=2.\n\ny_2=3, which is free at t=2.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut y_2=3, same as before when I stayed at start.\n\nThen to reach y=9, I need more actions.\n\nFor example, y_2=3 at t=2, then a_2=U, y_3=4 at t=3, and so on, to y_8=9 at t=8, H=8.\n\nWorse than H=7.\n\nIf at t=1, after y_1=2, I go up to y=3 at t=2, but as above.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo the stay at start is better.\n\nBut in the stay sequence, I have to avoid the later dangerous times.\n\nIn the sequence above, I reach y=8 at t=6, which is before t=8, so safe.\n\nBut what if I go faster? I can't with H=6.\n\nPerhaps I can go up and then stay or something, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=7 or 8 earlier, but y=7 and 8 are free until t=8.\n\nFor example, from y=3, if I could be at y=4 at t=2, y=5 at t=3, etc., same as before.\n\nAt t=0, I cannot go up immediately because y=4 at t=1 occupied.\n\nUnless I go to y=2 first, but y=2 at t=1 is free, but then I am lower.\n\nSuppose at t=0, go D to y=2 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=2, free.\n\nThen at t=1, go U to y=3 at t=2.\n\nt=2: y=3, free.\n\nThen at t=2, go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nBut y=4 at t=3 is free, as before.\n\nBut I used two actions to go from y=3 to y=4: down then up, so from t=0 y=3 to t=2 y=3, no progress, then to y=4 at t=3.\n\nCompared to staying: at t=0 S, y=3 at t=1, then U to y=4 at t=2.\n\nSame as going down and up: y=4 at t=3 vs t=2 in stay case.\n\nIn stay: y=4 at t=2.\n\nIn down-up: y=4 at t=3, later.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, staying or moving directly is better.\n\nNow, back to H=7 sequence.\n\nBut I need to make sure that at t=6, y=8 is safe, which it is, since occupied only at t=8,9,10.\n\nt=6 <8, free.\n\nSimilarly, all intermediate y are free at those times.\n\nBut what about y=7 at t=5, etc., all free between t=2 and t=7 for y=4 to8, except that y=2 has issue at t=2, but I'm not there.\n\nIn the path, I don't go to y=2.\n\nNow, but I need to reach y=9, and in the sequence, at t=7, y=9.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=7 but reaching earlier? No, since min steps.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some levels faster, but no, each step changes by one.\n\nAnother thought: I could go up to y=9 directly, but must go through intermediates.\n\nOr, I could stay at high y to avoid later collision, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nIn this sequence, I am at y=8 at t=6, and t=8 is dangerous, but I move to y=9 at t=7, before t=8.\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nThen for later times, no issue.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=4 (absolute) to t=4+6=10? Let's see.\n\nAbsolute turn: t_1=4.\n\nRelative t=0: turn 4\n\nt=1: turn 5\n\n...\n\nUp to t=6: turn 10, position after action at turn 10 is y=9.\n\nActions: for turn t_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nSo turns: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nActions: a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10\n\nIn relative:\n\nAt Δt=0 (turn 4): action a_4, which determines y at turn 5.\n\nPosition at turn: at turn 4, position y=3.\n\nAfter a_4, position at turn 5.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: position y=3\n\nAction a_4: in my plan, S, so stay, so at turn 5, position y=3\n\nThen turn 5: action a_5: U, so at turn 6, position y=4\n\nTurn 6: action a_6: U, at turn 7, y=5\n\nTurn 7: action a_7: U, at turn 8, y=6\n\nTurn 8: action a_8: U, at turn 9, y=7\n\nTurn 9: action a_9: U, at turn 10, y=8\n\nTurn 10: action a_10: U, at turn 11, y=9\n\nI need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, so that's fine.\n\nCollision check:\n\nAt turn 4: y=3, on freeway, occupied? No, safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=3, on freeway, occupied? No, safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=4, on freeway, occupied? At turn 6, Δt=2 (since t_1=4, turn t: Δt = t - t_1)\n\nTurn 4: Δt=0\n\nTurn 5: Δt=1\n\nTurn 6: Δt=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: Δt=7\n\nAt turn 6: Δt=2, y=4, freeway 4, occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10, not at 2, so free, safe.\n\nTurn 7: Δt=3, y=5, free, safe.\n\nTurn 8: Δt=4, y=6, free, safe.\n\nTurn 9: Δt=5, y=7, free, safe.\n\nTurn 10: Δt=6, y=8, free, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut H=7, and I reach at turn 11.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=6? We saw not possible.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=6 impossible, but let me confirm.\n\nSuppose I try to be at y=4 at Δt=2, but with H=6, I need y_6=9.\n\ny_0=3\n\ny_6=9\n\nSo y_1, y_2, ..., y_5 must be set.\n\nThe path must have y_t for t=0 to 5, and y_6=9.\n\nEach step y_{t+1} = y_t or y_t±1.\n\nTo go from 3 to 9 in 6 steps, must increase by 6, so all actions U, y_t = 3 + t for t=0 to6.\n\ny_0=3, y_1=4, y_2=5, y_3=6, y_4=7, y_5=8, y_6=9\n\nThen at t=1 (Δt=1), y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I have a down action, then I need to compensate with more up, but since I must reach +6, if I go down once, I need to go up twice to compensate, but I have only 6 actions, so if I go down at some point, I need to go up more elsewhere, but each up is +1, down -1, so if I go down once, I need seven up to net +6, but I have only 6 actions, impossible.\n\nExactly: net change must be +6 in 6 actions, so number of U minus number of D must be 6, and number of S such that U + D + S =6, U - D =6.\n\nThen U - D =6, U + D + S =6.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =12, subtract: 2D + S=0, so D=0, S=0, U=6.\n\nThus, only all U possible for H=6.\n\nBut that causes collision.\n\nTherefore, H=6 impossible.\n\nMinimal H=7.\n\nWith H=7, I can have other sequences, like with a down or something, but might be same or worse.\n\nFor example, if I go down at start, I need more actions to go up.\n\nSo the sequence with S at start is fine.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 4, action S.\n\nThen turn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: U to reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut turn 10 is the last action.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=7, t_1=4, so turns 4 to 10.\n\nAfter action at turn 10, position at turn 11 is y=9.\n\nNow, about the cars: I think I covered all.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 occupied at Δt=2 only.\n\nIn my path, at Δt=2, I am at y=4, not y=2, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 8,9,10, many freeways occupied, but in my sequence, at Δt=4,5,6 (turns 8,9,10), I am at y=6,7,8.\n\nTurn 8: absolute turn 8, Δt=4 (since t_1=4, turn 8 is t_1 +4, Δt=4)\n\nAt Δt=4, y=6 (in my sequence: at turn 8, position y=6? Let's see)\n\nTurn 8: position y=6? From above:\n\nTurn 8: action a_8, but position at turn 8 is before action.\n\nAt turn 8, position is y=6 (since after a_7 at turn 7, to y=6 at turn 8? No.\n\nList positions and actions carefully.\n\nTurn | Position at start | Action | Next position\n\nTurn 4: pos y=3 | action a_4 | to y for turn 5\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 4: pos y=3, action S → turn 5 pos y=3\n\nTurn 5: pos y=3, action U → turn 6 pos y=4\n\nTurn 6: pos y=4, action U → turn 7 pos y=5\n\nTurn 7: pos y=5, action U → turn 8 pos y=6\n\nTurn 8: pos y=6, action U → turn 9 pos y=7\n\nTurn 9: pos y=7, action U → turn 10 pos y=8\n\nTurn 10: pos y=8, action U → turn 11 pos y=9\n\nNow, collision at each turn based on position at that turn.\n\nTurn 4 (Δt=0): y=3, free, safe\n\nTurn 5 (Δt=1): y=3, free, safe\n\nTurn 6 (Δt=2): y=4, free, safe\n\nTurn 7 (Δt=3): y=5, free, safe\n\nTurn 8 (Δt=4): y=6, now at Δt=4, is y=6 occupied?\n\ny=6 freeway, occupied at Δt=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nΔt=4 not in, so free, safe.\n\nTurn 9 (Δt=5): y=7, freeway 7 occupied at Δt=8,9,10, not 5, free, safe.\n\nTurn 10 (Δt=6): y=8, freeway 8 occupied at Δt=8,9,10, not 6, free, safe.\n\nThen turn 11 (Δt=7): y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions for turns 4 to 10.\n\nActions: turn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 4 to turn 10, 7 actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be listed.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to 6 (since H-1=6), actions at t_1 + t.\n\nt_1=4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: a_{4} = S\n\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U\n\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster by avoiding the initial wait, but I cannot because of the occupancy.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, go U to y=4 at t=1, but at t=1, y=4 is occupied, collision.\n\nUnless I am not on y=4 at t=1, but I have to be if I go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=2 or something, but not helpful.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 2 at t=2, but I am not there.\n\nIn the output, I need to box the answer.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states.\n\nFreeway 2 has a car at Δt=2 occupied.\n\nBut in my path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different path with H=7 but starting with U to y=4 later, but same.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the player position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3), and we reach (0,9) at turn 11.\n\nNow, for the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an occupied freeway at any turn.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\), which is free (freeway 3 is occupied only at turns 12, 13, and 14 relative to \\(t_1\\), i.e., absolute turns 12, 13, 14).\n- At turn 5, moving up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) is safe because freeway 4 is free at turn 5 (relative time \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), but freeway 4 is occupied only at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\), and \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) corresponds to turn 5, which is occupied—wait, correction: at turn 5 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)), freeway 4 is occupied. However, in this sequence, at turn 5, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (after staying at turn 4), not \\(y = 4\\), so it is safe. Then, moving to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\)) is safe because freeway 4 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\).\n- Subsequent up (U) actions move the player to higher \\(y\\) levels, all of which are free at the respective turns (freeways 4-8 are occupied only at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\) or specific times, and the player passes through them at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) to \\(6\\), which are free).\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 after the action at turn 10.\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 4 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\))**: \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9, 10\\) only).\n- **Turn 5 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\))**: \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\).\n- **Turn 6 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\))**: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) (occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\)).\n- **Turn 7 (\\(\\Delta t = 3\\))**: \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) (occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\)).\n- **Turn 8 (\\(\\Delta t = 4\\))**: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\)).\n- **Turn 9 (\\(\\Delta t = 5\\))**: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) (occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9, 10\\)).\n- **Turn 10 (\\(\\Delta t = 6\\))**: \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 is free at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\) (occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9, 10\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 4 to 10 (7 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they're moving right with various speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y where for some car, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to turn t_1=6. The car positions are given at turn 6, and they move linearly with their speeds.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=6. So at t=6, player is at (0,4).\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when cars are at position 0, since that's where collision can happen if the player is on that freeway.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car at turn T.\n\nThe span changes over time. For right-moving cars, span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)], since at t_1, span is [τ, h] for right-moving, I think. Let me check the notation.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor car at t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, since direction is right.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\", but in the text it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state table, it says for example, freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4), so head h = -24, tail τ = -35? That seems odd because usually head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be larger than tail.\n\n-24 is greater than -35, since -24 > -35, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But it's written as (head, tail) = (-24, -35), which might be confusing.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nSince it's right-moving, and head is -24, tail is -35, so at t_1=6, the span is from tail to head? But the problem says for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which would be [-35, -24], but τ is tail, h is head, so [τ, h] means from tail to head, which for right-moving should be increasing if moving right.\n\n-35 to -24 is increasing, since -35 < -24, so it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,4), head 12, tail 1, so [τ,h] = [1,12], which is correct.\n\nAnd (48,37,right,4), head 48, tail 37, [37,48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for a car on freeway k at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y_T and 0 is within [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for some car on that freeway.\n\n0 ∈ [lower, upper], so lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper.\n\nSince the span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] and for right-moving, τ ≤ h, so lower ≤ upper.\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at t=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 5 units up, so minimum moves would be 5 Up actions, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nSince I can only move one step per turn or stay, the minimal H without cars would be 5 turns to go from 4 to 9 with U each time.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0.\n\nAlso, note that when I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I am on y at turn T, and only after the action, at turn T+1, I am on y+1. So for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since collision is checked at each turn based on y_T, when I move at turn T, I am still on y_T during turn T, so I can collide with cars on y_T if 0 in span at T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I collide with cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T+1.\n\nSo for each turn, I need to ensure that for the y I am on, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 6.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, and for each car, I need to find when 0 is in the span for that car.\n\nFirst, for a car with tail τ, head h, speed s, right-moving.\n\nThe position of the car at time T: the span is [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)]\n\n0 is in this span if τ + s(T-6) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-6)\n\nSince τ ≤ h, we can write:\n\nlower = τ + s(T-6)\n\nupper = h + s(T-6)\n\n0 ∈ [lower, upper] iff lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper\n\nWhich is τ + s(T-6) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s(T-6)\n\nOr equivalently, (T-6) ≤ -τ/s and (T-6) ≥ -h/s? Let's solve the inequalities.\n\nFrom lower ≤ 0: τ + s(T-6) ≤ 0 ⇒ s(T-6) ≤ -τ ⇒ T-6 ≤ -τ/s  (since s>0)\n\nFrom 0 ≤ upper: 0 ≤ h + s(T-6) ⇒ -h ≤ s(T-6) ⇒ T-6 ≥ -h/s\n\nSo 0 is in span when -h/s ≤ T-6 ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince τ ≤ h, -τ/s ≥ -h/s, so the interval is [ -h/s, -τ/s ]\n\nT-6 must be between ceil( -h/s ) and floor( -τ/s )? Since T is integer, we need to find integer T where this holds.\n\nActually, T-6 must satisfy lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper, so for each car, we can find the range of T where collision occurs if player is on that freeway.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the times when there is a car covering position 0.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: h = -24, τ = -35, s = 4\n\nThen 0 in span when -h/s ≤ T-6 ≤ -τ/s\n\n-(-24)/4 = 24/4 = 6\n\n-τ/s = -(-35)/4 = 35/4 = 8.75\n\nT-6 ≥ 6 and T-6 ≤ 8.75\n\nSince T integer, T-6 from 6 to 8 inclusive? T-6 ≥ 6 and T-6 ≤ 8.75, so T-6 = 6,7,8\n\nThus T = 12,13,14\n\nT-6=6 ⇒ T=12\n\nT-6=7 ⇒ T=13\n\nT-6=8 ⇒ T=14\n\nNow, is lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper at these points?\n\nAt T=12: lower = τ + s(T-6) = -35 + 4*(6) = -35 + 24 = -11\n\nupper = h + s(T-6) = -24 + 24 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, yes.\n\nAt T=13: lower = -35 + 4*7 = -35+28= -7\n\nupper = -24 + 28 = 4, so [ -7,4], 0 in, yes.\n\nAt T=14: lower = -35 + 4*8 = -35+32= -3\n\nupper = -24 + 32 = 8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt T=15: lower = -35 + 4*9 = -35+36=1\n\nupper = -24 + 36 = 12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nAt T=11: lower = -35 +4*5= -35+20= -15\n\nupper = -24 +20= -4, [ -15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, for first car, 0 covered at T=12,13,14.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), h=12, τ=1, s=4\n\n- h/s = -12/4 = -3\n\n- τ/s = -1/4 = -0.25\n\nT-6 ≥ -h/s = -(-3)?

Because -0.25, so T-6 <= -1 since integer, T-6 ≤ -0.25 implies T-6 ≤ -1.\n\nSimilarly, T-6 ≥ -3.\n\nSo T-6 = -3, -2, -1\n\nT = 3,4,5\n\nAt T=3: lower = τ + s(T-6) = 1 + 4*(-3) = 1 -12 = -11\n\nupper = 12 + 4*(-3) = 12 -12 =0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=4: lower=1 +4*(-2)=1-8=-7\n\nupper=12-8=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=5: lower=1 +4*(-1)=1-4=-3\n\nupper=12-4=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=6: lower=1 +4*0=1\n\nupper=12+0=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=2: lower=1+4*(-4)=1-16=-15\n\nupper=12-16=-4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo second car covers 0 at T=3,4,5.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,4), h=48, τ=37, s=4\n\n- h/s = -48/4 = -12\n\n- τ/s = -37/4 = -9.25\n\nT-6 ≥ -12 and T-6 ≤ -9.25\n\nT-6 integer, so T-6 ≥ -12 and T-6 ≤ -10? Since -9.25, T-6 <= -10? Let's see.\n\nT-6 ≤ -9.25, since T-6 integer, T-6 ≤ -10\n\nBecause -10 <= -9.25 is false? -10 < -9.25, so T-6 <= -10\n\nAnd T-6 >= -12\n\nSo T-6 = -12, -11, -10\n\nT = -6, -5, -4? That's before t_1=6, but we care about T>=6 or any T? Collision can happen at any turn, but since we start at T=6, and T increases, we care about T>=6.\n\nFor T-6 <= -10, which is T <= -4, which is before 6, so for T>=6, no coverage.\n\nAt T=6: lower=37 +4*0=37\n\nupper=48, [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, always positive, so no coverage for T>=6.\n\nSo for freeway 1, cars cover 0 at:\n\nFirst car: T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: T=3,4,5 (but T=3,4,5 before 6, so for T>=6, only first car at T=12,13,14\n\nThird car no.\n\nSo freeway 1 has collision at T=12,13,14 if player is on y=1.\n\nNow freeway 2:\n\nCars: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nOnly one car: h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\n- h/s = -0/12 =0\n\n- τ/s = -(-11)/12 = 11/12 ≈ 0.9167\n\nT-6 ≥ 0 and T-6 ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.9167\n\nT-6 integer, so T-6 ≥ 0 and T-6 ≤ 0.9167, so T-6 = 0\n\nThus T=6\n\nAt T=6: lower = τ + s(T-6) = -11 + 12*0 = -11\n\nupper = h + s(T-6) = 0 + 0 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=7: lower = -11 +12*1 =1\n\nupper=0+12=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=5: lower=-11 +12*(-1)= -11-12=-23\n\nupper=0-12=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=6, freeway 2 has collision.\n\nFreeway 3:\n\nCars: (-24, -35, right, 4) same as first car on freeway 1.\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, s=4\n\nCoverage at T=12,13,14 as before.\n\nFreeway 4:\n\nCars: same as freeway 1: (-24,-35,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4)\n\nSo same as freeway 1: collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: same as above, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: same, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-35,right,4) only, so collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,-35,right,4) only, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, freeway 2 is different, only collision at T=6.\n\nBut freeway 2 is y=2.\n\nNow, player starts at t=6, y=4.\n\nAt t=6, if player is on y=4, is there collision? Freeway 4 has cars, but at t=6, for freeway 4, when is 0 covered?\n\nFor freeway 4, cars are same as freeway 1, which at t=6: second car at t=3,4,5, not 6; first car at t=12,13,14; third not. So at t=6, no car covers 0 on freeway 4? Similarly for others.\n\nLet's confirm for each freeway at t=6.\n\nGeneral: for any freeway k, at turn T, collision if for some car on k, 0 in span at T.\n\nAt T=6:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: first car at t=12,13,14 not 6; second car at t=3,4,5 not 6; third not. So no collision on y=1 at t=6.\n\nFreeway 2: car at t=6 only, so at t=6, collision on y=2.\n\nFreeway 3: only one car, same as freeway1 first car, at t=12,13,14, not t=6.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway1, no at t=6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5,6,7,8 all have cars that cover at t=12,13,14 or before, but not at t=6 except freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have only one car each, which covers t=12,13,14, not t=6.\n\nSo at t=6, only freeway 2 has collision, meaning if player is on y=2 at t=6, collision occurs.\n\nBut player is at y=4 at t=6, so no collision.\n\nNow, player wants to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, player needs to be on y=8 or something and move up.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,4), which is on freeway? Position (0,y), but the freeway is the y-coordinate.\n\nWhen player is at (0,y), if y between 1 and 8, it is on freeway y.\n\nAt t=6, player at (0,4), so on freeway 4.\n\nAt t=6, is freeway 4 safe? From above, for freeway 4, at t=6, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: 5 up moves, but I need to avoid being on a freeway when it has a car at 0.\n\nThe dangerous times are when for a freeway, at certain turns, it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for freeways 1,3,4,5,6,7,8, they are occupied at t=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 2 is occupied only at t=6.\n\nSince t=6 is past, and we start at t=6, for t>6, freeway 2 is safe, because only collision at t=6.\n\nAt t=7,8,... freeway 2 has no car at 0.\n\nNow, freeways 1,3,4,5,6,7,8 are all dangerous at t=12,13,14.\n\nThat is, if player is on any of these freeways at t=12,13, or 14, collision occurs.\n\nBecause all of them have a car covering 0 at those times.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 at t=12,13,14; similarly freeway 3 only one car, same; freeway 4 same; etc.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 also have only that car, which covers t=12,13,14.\n\nSo for y=1,3,4,5,6,7,8, all are unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\ny=2 is safe at those times, since only dangerous at t=6.\n\nBut we are at t=6, and we start moving from t=6 onwards.\n\nNow, t=12,13,14 are future turns.\n\nPlayer at t=6, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nIf I go up directly: U at t=6, to y=5 at t=7; U at t=7 to y=6 at t=8; U at t=8 to y=7 at t=9; U at t=9 to y=8 at t=10; U at t=10 to y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, check if safe.\n\nAt t=6, y=4: freeway 4, at t=6, no car at 0, as established, safe.\n\nt=7, y=5: freeway 5, at t=7, is there car at 0?\n\nFor freeway 5, cars same as freeway1, which are dangerous only at t=12,13,14, not at t=7. Similarly, at t=7, no issue. Safe.\n\nt=8, y=6: freeway 6, safe, no car at 0 at t=8.\n\nt=9, y=7: freeway 7, at t=9? Freeway 7 has car that covers t=12,13,14, not t=9. So safe.\n\nt=10, y=8: freeway 8, at t=10, safe.\n\nt=11, y=9: not a freeway, safe.\n\nAnd I reach at t=11.\n\nBut t=12,13,14 are later, not reached.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=6 to t=11, I am never on a freeway at t=12,13,14 because at t=11 I am at y=9.\n\nt=11 is before 12.\n\nSo in 5 turns, I reach at t=11, y=9.\n\nIs there any problem?\n\nAt t=10, y=8, freeway 8, at t=10, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8 has car: (-24,-35,right,4), which covers t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=10: T-6=4, lower = τ + s(T-6) = -35 + 4*4 = -35+16= -19\n\nupper = -24 + 16 = -8, so [-19,-8], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the dangerous times are t=12,13,14 for y=1,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nIn my sequence, I am not on those freeways at those times.\n\nMoreover, at t=6, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 4 at t=6.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: (-24,-35,right,4): at t=6, T-6=0, lower=-35, upper=-24, [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\n(12,1,right,4): at t=6, lower=1, upper=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\n(48,37,right,4): lower=37, upper=48, 0 not in. So safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=7, y=5, freeway 5, same cars, at T-6=1, lower for first car: -35+4= -31, upper=-24+4=-20, not 0.\n\nSecond car: lower=1+4=5, upper=12+4=16, not 0.\n\nThird: lower=37+4=41, upper=48+4=52, not 0. Safe.\n\nt=8, y=6: similar, T-6=2, first car: -35+8=-27, -24+8=-16, no.\n\nSecond: 1+8=9,12+8=20,no. Third:37+8=45,48+8=56,no.\n\nt=9, y=7: freeway 7 has only one car: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAt T-6=3, lower=-35+12= -23? s=4, T-6=3, so lower= -35 +4*3= -35+12= -23\n\nupper= -24 +12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nt=10, y=8: freeway 8, car (-24,-35,right,4), T-6=4, lower=-35+16= -19, upper=-24+16= -8, [-19,-8], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nt=11, y=9, safe.\n\nSo I reach in 5 turns, at turn t=11.\n\nBut turn t=6 + t, from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t=6, action a_{t_1} = a_6.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=10, since at t=6, I do action to go to t=7 position.\n\nPlayer at turn T, position y_T, then after action a_T, at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt turn t=6, I am at y=4.\n\nI do a_6 = U, so at t=7, y=5.\n\nAt turn t=6, y=4, safe as above.\n\nAt turn t=7, y=5, safe.\n\nAnd so on, up to at turn t=10, y=8, I do U, so at t=11, y=9.\n\nAt turn t=11, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAnd I have reached.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nI start at t=6, after H actions, at turn t=6+H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 =6, position y_6=4.\n\nAfter first action at t=6, to t=7, y_7.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd the sequence of actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nIn minimal H, I want to minimize H.\n\nWith no cars, from y=4 to y=9, need 5 up moves, so H=5, reach at turn t=6+5=11.\n\nIn this case, with cars, it seems possible with H=5.\n\nBut are there any issues at intermediate steps? I think I checked.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 2, but I didn't go there.\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid t=12,13,14, but since I finish before, no problem.\n\nBut what if I take more time? But minimal is 5.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=6, for freeway 2, it is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is given at (0,4) at turn t_1=6, so at turn 6, I am already there, and I need to choose actions starting from a_{t_1} = a_6.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U.\n\nThen at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nBut turn t=11 is t_1 + 5, since 6+5=11.\n\nH=5 turns of actions.\n\nAnswer should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=5, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 2 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, freeway 2 has car at 0, so if I were on y=2 at t=6, collision, but I am on y=4, so ok.\n\nIn my path, I never go to y=2.\n\nNow, is there a reason to take a different path? For example, if I go down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nPerhaps I need to be careful around t=12, but since I reach before, no issue.\n\nBut let me see the time: t=12 is 6 turns after start, but I reach at t=11, which is before.\n\nt=11 < 12.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, there are other dangerous times, but from the list, only t=12,13,14 for y=1,3-8, and t=6 for y=2.\n\nBut t=6 is the start, and I am not on y=2.\n\nSo for t>6, only danger at t=12,13,14 for y=1,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=2 is safe for t>6.\n\nIn my path, I go through y=4,5,6,7,8 at t=6,7,8,9,10 respectively, all before t=12, so safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I cannot, since only one step per turn.\n\nUnless I can move faster, but no, actions are U,D,S, only change by 1 or stay.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 4 at t=6, etc., I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor freeway 1: unsafe at t=12,13,14\n\nOther times safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2: unsafe only at t=6, safe for t>6.\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=6, y=4.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to increase y by 5.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so at least 5 U actions.\n\nWith S or D, it would take more turns, so minimal H=5 with all U.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=6 to t=10, actions U, positions: t=6 y=4, t=7 y=5, t=8 y=6, t=9 y=7, t=10 y=8, t=11 y=9.\n\nAll positions at turns t=6 to t=10 are on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 respectively, and at those times, all are safe, as checked.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=6, y=4, freeway 4 safe (not unsafe times)\n\n- t=7, y=5, freeway 5 safe\n\n- t=8, y=6, freeway 6 safe\n\n- t=9, y=7, freeway 7 safe\n\n- t=10, y=8, freeway 8 safe\n\n- Then at t=11, y=9, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, with all actions U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=6, H=5, so actions at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut let me write:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd done.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 11, after 5 actions.\n\nBut in the boxed answer.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nI think I might have missed something.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=6 is safe, but let me confirm the cars again.\n\nIn freeway 4, there is a car (12,1,right,4), which at t=6, position: since moving right, at t=6, span [1 +0, 12+0] = [1,12], not including 0, yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, but not relevant.\n\nAnother point: the note says that when moving, at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so for example, if I were to move to a freeway at turn T, but since collision is at turn T based on y_T, it should be fine.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps at t=14, if I were on y=8, but I am not.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in less than 5? Impossible, since from 4 to 9, need 5 steps.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 5 turns.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe turn labels: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince t_1=6, it's Turn 6: U, etc.\n\nAnd since H=5, from t=6 to t=10.\n\nt= t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = 6 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions:\n- Cars on freeways \\(y = 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) cover position 0 at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\), meaning these freeways are unsafe at those turns.\n- Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe only at turn \\(T = 6\\) and safe for \\(T > 6\\).\n- At turn \\(T = 6\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 4\\), which is safe since no car covers position 0 at that turn (as verified by car spans).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9):\n- From \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\), the minimum number of moves required is 5, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- A sequence of 5 \"U\" actions from turn 6 to turn 10 reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, avoiding all collisions:\n  - At turn 6: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 has no car at 0).\n  - At turn 7: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe, no car at 0 at \\(T=7\\)).\n  - At turn 8: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe, no car at 0 at \\(T=8\\)).\n  - At turn 9: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe, no car at 0 at \\(T=9\\)).\n  - At turn 10: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe, no car at 0 at \\(T=10\\)).\n  - At turn 11: \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, always safe).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 5\\) turns, which is minimal since fewer turns are impossible (5 steps are needed to increase \\(y\\) by 5).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are applied at turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6\\) to \\(10\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 8 and the player is at (0,6). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car update rules: all cars are moving right (since direction is \"right\")? Actually, looking at the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: \n  Cars: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the head is at the right end? Actually, the description says:\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> at time T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the head is the larger coordinate? But in the data, the first car on freeway1 is (-16,-27,right,4). \nIf we interpret [τ, h] as [tail, head] then for a right-moving car, the tail is the left end and head is the right end. \nBut here, -27 is less than -16? That doesn't make sense because then the tail would be at -27 and head at -16? \n\nWait, the description says:\n  For a left-moving car: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  For a right-moving car: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the data, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for the first car on freeway1: head=-16, tail=-27? \nThat would imply that for a right-moving car, we have tail=-27 and head=-16? Then the span is [-27, -16]? \nBut then at time T, it becomes [-27 + 4*(T-t1), -16 + 4*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (20,9,right,4): head=20, tail=9 -> span [9,20] -> at time T: [9+4*(T-t1), 20+4*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the car (20,9,right,4) has tail=9 and head=20? Then the car occupies from 9 to 20? But 9 to 20 is 12 units? And the car length is 20-9+1 = 12? Actually, the span is continuous? Or discrete? The grid is discrete? The problem says the vertical axis is discrete (y=0,...,9) but the horizontal is not specified? However, the collision condition is at x=0? \n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is at (0, y_T) and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nSo we are only concerned with the x=0 column and the freeway row at the time the player is on that freeway.\n\nWe note that the player's movement: \n  At turn t, the player is at (0, y_t). Then they choose an action (U, D, S) which will move them to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nImportant: when the player is on a freeway row at turn t, they must not collide with any car on that freeway at that same turn.\n\nBut note: if at turn t the player is on row y_t, and then they move to row y_{t+1} at turn t+1, then at turn t they are only on row y_t and at turn t+1 they are on row y_{t+1}. So they are not on row y_{t+1} at turn t? Therefore, the collision condition only applies at the exact turn when the player is on that row.\n\nGiven the initial state at turn t1=8:\n\nPlayer at (0,6). We need to get to (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nThe freeways that matter are y=1 to 8. The player starts at y=6 and must go to y=9. So they must move upward: U moves them up by 1, D down by 1, S stays.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. However, note that the player is currently on freeway 6? But wait: the freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The player is at y=6, which is freeway 6? \n\nAt turn t1=8, the player is at (0,6). We are going to plan the actions from turn t1=8 onwards.\n\nWe must check for each freeway row that we step on at a given turn whether at that turn there is a car on that freeway that covers x=0.\n\nSo let's list the cars per freeway at the initial time t1=8.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n  Car1: (-16,-27,right,4) -> at time T: span = [-27 + 4*(T-8), -16 + 4*(T-8)]\n  Car2: (20,9,right,4) -> [9 + 4*(T-8), 20 + 4*(T-8)]\n  Car3: (56,45,right,4) -> [45 + 4*(T-8), 56 + 4*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car\n  Car: (24,13,right,12) -> [13 + 12*(T-8), 24 + 12*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 3: one car\n  Car: (-16,-27,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car1\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway1: three cars\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway1: three cars\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway1: three cars\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway1 car1: one car\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway1 car1: one car\n\nWe are concerned only when the player is on a particular freeway at a particular turn. And we are only concerned with whether at that turn T, the car's span on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=8), we can compute if there is a car on freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in the span.\n\nBut note: the player starts at turn 8 at y=6. Then at turn 9, the player will be at a new row, and so on.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we can get to y=9 in H-1 moves? Actually, the sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nThe moves: \n  t=t1: we are at y6. Then we choose an action at t1 to move to y7 (if U) or stay at y6 (if S) or go down to y5 (if D). Then at the next turn we choose again.\n\nThe minimal H: we need at least 3 moves upward because from 6 to 9 we need 3 steps up. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions.\n\nSo H must be at least 3? But note: we start at turn t1=8 and we are at y=6. We need to be at y=9 at some turn T. The minimal T is 8+3 = 11? Because:\n\n  Turn 8: at 6\n  Turn 9: at 7 (if U)\n  Turn 10: at 8 (if U)\n  Turn 11: at 9 (if U)\n\nSo H=4? (turns 8,9,10,11 -> 4 turns) but the sequence of actions would be for t=8,9,10: three actions? \n\nThe problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So the first action is at t1 (t=0 corresponds to t1) and the last action is at t1+H-1. Then the position at turn t1+H is (0,9)? \n\nBut note: the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo if we take H actions, then the positions we are at are:\n  At turn t1: y0 (given)\n  After action a_{t1} (t=0): we get y1 at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  After action a_{t1+H-1}: we get y_H at turn t1+H.\n\nWe require y_H = 9? Actually the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Let me check:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd the position at the end of the sequence should be (0,9). \n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. The position after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is at turn t1+H? \n\nWait, the update: at turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}. \n\nSo at turn t1, we take action a_{t1} to determine y_{t1+1}. \nAt turn t1+1, we take a_{t1+1} to determine y_{t1+2}.\n...\nAt turn t1+H-1, we take a_{t1+H-1} to determine y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H, the position is (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? Actually, it says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait, the sequence of actions is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the position after the last action is at turn t1+H. However, the problem states:\n\n\"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut that would be the position at turn t1+H-1? How is that consistent?\n\nLet me reindex:\n\nAt turn t1 (initial): y_{t1} = 6.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} (at turn t1): we get y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nSo the position at turn t1+t is y_{t1+t}.\n\nWe require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? But note the actions: we have actions from t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions. Then the position at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis suggests that the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, and then we require that at that same turn t1+H-1, the position is 9? \n\nBut that is not consistent because the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions taken up to turn t1+H-2. \n\nActually, the problem defines the state at the beginning of the turn. Then we choose an action for that turn, and then the next state is computed.\n\nThe problem says: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nand the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then y_{t+1} is computed.\n\nTherefore, at the start of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then they choose a_t, and then at the start of turn t+1, they are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the position at the start of turn t is y_t.\n\nWe are given at turn t1=8: y_8 = 6.\n\nWe take actions at turns 8, 9, 10, ... until we get to a turn where we are at 9.\n\nWe require to be at 9 at the start of some turn T. Then T = t1 + H? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then after these H actions, the position at the next turn (t1+H) is y_{t1+H}. But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then the answer format:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo there are H actions. And the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position after the last action is at turn t1+H. But the problem says we require to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are to be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1? But then we haven't taken the action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nI think the problem might be inconsistent. However, note the example in the problem statement: \n\n\"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThis suggests that at the start of turn t1+H-1, the position is 9. But then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? That would be after we are already at 9? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal H is the number of actions? And we are to be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H? \n\nI think the problem means: we take H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9. \n\nBut then why does it say \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" in the requirement? It doesn't. It says \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nLooking again: the problem says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is not written. It only says \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut in the answer format, we are to write actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. And we want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The minimal H such that after H actions we are at 9.\n\nSo after H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, the position at the start of turn t1+H is 9.\n\nWe start at turn t1=8: y8=6.\n\nWe take H actions: a8, a9, ..., a8+H-1.\n\nThen at turn 8+H, we are at y_{8+H}=9.\n\nThe minimal H? Without obstacles, we can do H=3: \n  a8 = U -> y9=7\n  a9 = U -> y10=8\n  a10 = U -> y11=9\n\nSo we would write:\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n\nAnd then at turn 11, we are at 9. So H=3? But the sequence has 3 actions.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. The collisions happen at the turn when we are on a freeway row. Specifically, at the start of a turn, we are at y_t, and then we are on freeway y_t (if y_t is between 1 and 8) and we must not have a car on that freeway at that turn covering x=0.\n\nSo for the path above:\n\n  Turn 8: we are at y=6 -> freeway6? We must check freeway6 at turn8.\n\nFreeway6 at turn8: \n  Cars: \n    Car1: at turn8: span = [-27 + 4*(8-8) = -27, -16] -> [-27, -16] -> doesn't include 0.\n    Car2: [9 + 4*(0)=9, 20] -> [9,20] -> 0 not in [9,20]\n    Car3: [45,56] -> no.\n\nSo at turn8, freeway6 is safe.\n\nThen we take U: so at turn9, we are at y=7.\n\nAt turn9: we are on freeway7? Check freeway7 at turn9.\n\nFreeway7 has one car: (-16,-27,right,4)\n  At turn9: T=9 -> T-8=1 -> span = [-27+4*1 = -23, -16+4= -12] -> [-23,-12] -> doesn't include 0? So safe.\n\nThen at turn9, we take U -> at turn10, we are at y=8.\n\nAt turn10: freeway8 -> check freeway8 at turn10.\n  Car: same as freeway7 -> at T=10: T-8=2 -> span = [-27+8 = -19, -16+8=-8] -> [-19,-8] -> no 0.\n\nThen at turn10, we take U -> at turn11, we are at y=9. And y=9 is the goal (and above freeway8, so no car to check?).\n\nSo the minimal H is 3? And the sequence is U, U, U.\n\nBut wait, the goal is (0,9). The freeways are only from 1 to 8. So at y=9, there are no cars. And at y=0, also no cars? But we are going up to 9.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut let me check if there is any car that might hit at the intermediate steps? \n\nWe checked:\n  Turn8: freeway6 -> safe.\n  Turn9: freeway7 -> safe.\n  Turn10: freeway8 -> safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We only step on freeway6 at turn8, freeway7 at turn9, freeway8 at turn10. The other freeways we never step on? So no need to check.\n\nBut wait, what if we move and we are on a freeway for two consecutive turns? In this plan, we are on each freeway only for one turn.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut the problem has freeway2 with a car (24,13,right,12). But we never step on freeway2? So we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3? Then the answer would be:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut let me double-check the car movements for freeway6 at turn8, freeway7 at turn9, freeway8 at turn10.\n\nFreeway6 at turn8 (t1=8, so T=8, T-t1=0):\n  Car1: [-27, -16] -> no 0.\n  Car2: [9,20] -> no 0.\n  Car3: [45,56] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway7 at turn9 (T=9, T-t1=1):\n  Car: [-27+4= -23, -16+4=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway8 at turn10 (T=10, T-t1=2):\n  Car: [-27+8=-19, -16+8=-8] -> [-19,-8] -> no 0.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway5? We are never on freeway5? So no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H is 3? \n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are taking 3 actions (from turn8 to turn10) and then at turn11 we are at 9. So H=3? But note the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence has H actions. \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of actions is for H turns? \n\nIn the context, H is the number of actions? And we are to take H actions? Then yes.\n\nBut let me see if there is a problem with the car on freeway2? It has speed 12. At turn8: [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]. At turn9: [13+12=25, 24+12=36] -> still not. So no.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway2 at turn8: [13,24] -> but we are not on freeway2 at turn8? We are on freeway6.\n\nSo I think the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are stepping on freeways 6,7,8 at turns 8,9,10 respectively, and we checked they are safe.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? For example, if at turn8 freeway6 had a car at 0? Then we might have to wait (S) until it passes. But in this case, we don't.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the initial turn is t1=8, and we take actions at turns 8,9,10 -> three actions, so H=3.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found H=3.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We are at 6, we need to get to 9: we need three moves up. So we cannot do it in less than 3 moves. So 3 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1. So for H=3, t=0,1,2 -> actions at t1+0=8, t1+1=9, t1+2=10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut note: at the last action (turn10) we move to y11=9. So we are at 9 at turn11. The problem doesn't require us to be at 9 at an earlier turn? And we are not taking an action at turn11? So we are done.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at turn11. \n\nIs there any requirement to be at (0,9) at a particular turn? No, just as soon as possible.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut wait, what if at turn8 we had a collision? Then we might have to wait. But we checked: at turn8, freeway6 is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway6 at turn8 again: the cars are at [-27,-16], [9,20], [45,56]. None of these intervals contain 0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn9: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn10: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=3? But the turns we are acting are 8,9,10 -> three turns. And then we are done at turn11.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\". Is H the number of turns we take actions? Or the total turns including the starting turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions is for H turns. So H=3.\n\nAlternatively, if H is the total number of turns from start to finish, then we start at turn8 and finish at turn11, which is 4 turns? But the sequence only has 3 actions.\n\nI think the problem means H as the number of actions. Because the sequence has H actions. And the answer format has H lines.\n\nSo we output the three actions.\n\nBut to be safe, let me consider if we can do it in two actions? That would be:\n\n  a8: U -> y9=7\n  a9: U -> y10=8 -> but we are at 8, not 9. \n  Then we need a10: U -> to get to 9 at turn11.\n\nSo we need three.\n\nOr if we try to double move? But the moves are only ±1 or 0.\n\nSo three is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut wait: the problem has freeway6 with three cars. What if one of the cars was going to cover 0 at turn8? But it doesn't.\n\nHowever, I notice that the car on freeway2 has a high speed (12). But we are not on freeway2.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway2? We don't.\n\nSo I think we are safe.\n\nBut let me simulate the car on freeway6 at turn8: it's safe.\n\nAt turn9, freeway7: safe.\n\nAt turn10, freeway8: safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are stepping on freeway6 at turn8, freeway7 at turn9, freeway8 at turn10. We checked.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway2: \n  At turn8: [13+12*(0)=13, 24] -> doesn't include 0.\n  At turn9: [13+12=25, 24+12=36] -> no.\n  At turn10: [13+24=37, 24+24=48] -> no.\n\nBut we are not on freeway2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same as freeway1 car1: at turn8: [-27,-16] -> safe. But we are not on freeway3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is three moves up.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn 8 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. The goal requires moving up 3 units (from y=6 to y=9), which takes at least 3 actions (U moves) if no waiting is needed.\n\n### Collision Check:\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6) at turn 8:**  \n  Cars:  \n  - (-16, -27, right, 4): Span = [-27 + 4*(8-8), -16 + 4*(8-8)] = [-27, -16] → 0 ∉ [-27, -16]  \n  - (20, 9, right, 4): Span = [9 + 4*(0), 20 + 4*(0)] = [9, 20] → 0 ∉ [9, 20]  \n  - (56, 45, right, 4): Span = [45 + 4*(0), 56 + 4*(0)] = [45, 56] → 0 ∉ [45, 56]  \n  **Safe to be at y=6 on turn 8.**\n\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7) at turn 9:**  \n  Car: (-16, -27, right, 4): Span = [-27 + 4*(9-8), -16 + 4*(9-8)] = [-23, -12] → 0 ∉ [-23, -12]  \n  **Safe to be at y=7 on turn 9.**\n\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8) at turn 10:**  \n  Car: (-16, -27, right, 4): Span = [-27 + 4*(10-8), -16 + 4*(10-8)] = [-19, -8] → 0 ∉ [-19, -8]  \n  **Safe to be at y=8 on turn 10.**\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Turn 8:** Move up (U) from y=6 to y=7. Collision check at y=6 (turn 8) is safe.\n2. **Turn 9:** Move up (U) from y=7 to y=8. Collision check at y=7 (turn 9) is safe.\n3. **Turn 10:** Move up (U) from y=8 to y=9. Collision check at y=8 (turn 10) is safe.\n\nAfter turn 10, at turn 11, the player reaches (0, 9). Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), no collision check is needed. This plan uses 3 actions (H=3), which is minimal as 3 moves up are required.\n\n### Answer:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 8 to 10 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

The cars are moving right or left with given speeds, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car that has its span including 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=7 and need to get to y=9, I probably need to move up. But I have to go through y=8, and there might be cars there. Also, y=9 is the goal, so no cars there since freeways are only y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y), and we move vertically with actions U, D, S for up, down, stay. Horizontal position is always 0, I think, since we're moving vertically between rows.\n\nNow, the car spans: for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed. Direction: right means moving right, so as time increases, the position increases. Left-moving would decrease, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the data.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4)\n\nHead and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so for the first car, head at -12, tail at -23, which means it's from x=-23 to x=-12? But direction right, so moving right.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), and for right-moving, head > tail, I assume.\n\nIn the first car: head=-12, tail=-23, so since head > tail, and right-moving, so at time t, it spans from tail to head, I think? No.\n\nLet's read the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so at t1, position from tail to head, with head > tail.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, first car: (head=-12, tail=-23, right,4)\n\nSince right-moving, at t1, the span is [tail, head] = [-23, -12]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-23 + 4(T-t1), -12 + 4(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=24, tail=13, right,4, so at t1, [13,24], at T, [13+4(T-t1), 24+4(T-t1)]\n\nThird car: head=60, tail=49, right,4, at t1 [49,60], at T [49+4(T-t1),60+4(T-t1)]\n\nNow for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (36,25,right,12) so head=36, tail=25, right,12, at t1 [25,36], at T [25+12(T-t1),36+12(T-t1)]\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-12,-23,right,4) same as freeway 1 first car, at t1 [-23,-12], at T [-23+4(T-t1),-12+4(T-t1)]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars same as freeway 1: (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4)\n\nSimilarly freeway 5,6 same as freeway 1 with three cars.\n\nFreeway 5: same, freeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7: one car (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: one car (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nAnd current turn t1 = 9, player at y=7.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, I just need to reach there.\n\nBut to get there, I need to pass through y=8, or directly from y=7 to y=9? But with actions, I can only change y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, so from y=7, I need at least two moves: to y=8 then y=9, or to y=6 then up, but that might be longer, so probably best to go up directly.\n\nMinimal H should be 2, if I can go up to y=8 at turn t1, then to y=9 at turn t1+1.\n\nBut I need to check for collisions.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if I am on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nWhen I am at position (0, y_T) at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I collide if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: when I move, at turn T, if I move to a different row, I am not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nIn this case, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I only check cars on y_T for collision at turn T.\n\nWhen I take action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t). I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t, I am on row y_t, and I collide if for freeway y_t, there is a car with 0 in its span at time t.\n\nThen I move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nNow, current turn is t1=9, I am at y=7.\n\nSo at turn 9, I am on y=7, and I need to check if there is a collision at turn 9 on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has one car: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nAt turn t=9, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] but t1 is the current turn, which is 9.\n\nt1 is given as 9, so for any time T, relative to t1.\n\nSet t1 = 9 as the reference.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, at time T (global time), the span is based on the state at t1.\n\nSince t1=9, and we're starting from there.\n\nFor freeway 7 at turn T, the car span is [τ + s(T - 9), h + s(T - 9)] with τ = -23, h = -12, s=4.\n\nFor right-moving, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with τ=tail, h=head.\n\nSo here, tail = -23, head = -12, s=4.\n\nAt time T, span: [-23 + 4(T-9), -12 + 4(T-9)]\n\nI need 0 not in this span at time T when I am on that row.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, at turn t=9, I am on y=7.\n\nCheck freeway 7: car span at T=9: [-23 + 4(0), -12 + 4(0)] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 is not in [-23,-12], so no collision at turn 9 on y=7.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9. Possible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf I go U, to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nIf I go D, to y=6, which is farther, probably not good.\n\nS, stay at y=7, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nMinimal H is 2, so let's try to go to y=8 at turn 10, then to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut I need to check collisions at each turn.\n\nAt turn 9: I am on y=7, no collision, as above.\n\nNow, I take action at turn 9, which affects y_{10}.\n\nSuppose I take U at turn 9, so y_{10} = 8.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am on y=8.\n\nNow, freeway 8 has one car: (-12,-23,right,4) same as freeway 7.\n\nAt time T=10, span: [-23 + 4(10-9), -12 + 4(10-9)] = [-23 +4, -12+4] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], so no collision at turn 10 on y=8.\n\nThen at turn 10, I take action, say U to go to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am on y=9, which is not a freeway, no cars, so no collision, and I reached (0,9).\n\nSo with H=2 turns, actions: at turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nBut turn t1=9, and t=0 to H-1, so for H=2, actions at t=9 and t=10.\n\nSequence: turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am at y=9, but the turn when I reach is turn 11? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after that, at turn t1+H, I am at position.\n\nThe sequence of actions is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter these actions, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H-1} = 9? No.\n\nLook: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nThe task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, y_{t1 + 0} = y_{t1} =7, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, y_{t1 +1} should be 9.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} is the position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nWe need that at some turn T = t1 + H - 1, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H - 1, so H = T - t1 +1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 10, T=10, t1=9, H=10-9+1=2.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9 + H -1}\n\nSet this to 9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{9+2-1} = y_{10} =9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=1, y_{9+1-1}=y9=7≠9.\n\nSo for y10=9, we need H=2.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H=2, actions at t=9 and t=10? t from 0 to H-1=1, so t=0: t1+0=9, t=1: t1+1=10.\n\nAction a9 and a10.\n\nAfter a9, y10 is set.\n\nAfter a10, y11 is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1+H-1} = y_{10} for H=2.\n\ny10 is set by action a9.\n\nAt turn 10, position is y10, which is after action a9.\n\nThen at turn 10, we take action a10, which sets y11.\n\nBut for the position to be 9 at turn 10, it must be that after action a9, y10=9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at 9 at turn 10, we need to have moved to it by action at turn 9.\n\nIn this case, from y9=7, to have y10=9, I need to move up twice? No.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t = +1 for U, etc.\n\nSo from y9=7, if I take U, y10=8.\n\nIf I take U again at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nBut to have y10=9, I need to be at 8 at turn 9 and take U, or something.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nIf y9=7, Δy9 can be +1, so y10=8, or -1, y10=6, or 0, y10=7.\n\nCannot go directly to 9 in one step.\n\ny_t is integer, 0 to 9, so to go from 7 to 9, minimum two steps: first to 8, then to 9.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=9 is turn 11, with y11=9.\n\nThen for y11=9, T=11, t1=9, H = T - t1 +1 = 11-9+1=3.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9 + H -1} =9\n\nSet 9 + H -1 =11, so H-1=2, H=3.\n\nSimilarly, if I can reach at turn 10, but from y9=7, y10 can be at most 8, so y10=9 impossible.\n\ny10 must be 0 to 9, so from 7, after one action, y10=6,7, or 8.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y11 can be 9 if y10=8 and take U.\n\nOr y10=9 if I was at 9 at turn 9, but I'm not.\n\nSo earliest possible turn to be at y=9 is turn 11.\n\nThus minimal H should be 3, with y_{11} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, so for H=3, actions at t=9,10,11? t from 0 to 2, so actions at t1+0=9, t1+1=10, t1+2=11.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9+3-1} = y_{11} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I could reach earlier, but I can't, since from 7 to 9 takes at least two moves.\n\nNow, in those actions, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at y=7, which we checked, no collision.\n\nThen I take action at turn 9, say a9.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am at y10, and check collision on that row.\n\nThen take action a10, set y11.\n\nAt turn 11, if y11=9, no collision since no cars.\n\nBut to have y11=9, I need y10=8 and a10=U.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at turn 10.\n\nNow, at turn 10, I am on y=10? y10.\n\nIf y10=8, I am on freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nWe need no collision at turn 10 on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, on y=7, no collision.\n\nNow, freeway 8 has one car: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nAt turn T=10, span: [-23 + 4(10-9), -12 + 4(10-9)] = [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], so no collision.\n\nThen at turn 10, I take U, so y11=9.\n\nAt turn 11, on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut at turn 10, I am on y=8, which is fine.\n\nIn this case, with actions: at turn 9, I need to set y10.\n\nI start at turn 9 on y=7.\n\nI take action a9.\n\nIf I take U, y10=8.\n\nThen at turn 10, on y=8, no collision, as above.\n\nThen take U at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut I could take other actions, but this seems fine.\n\nThe problem is to minimize H, and H=3 is minimal possible since I need to reach turn 11.\n\ny11=9 requires H=3.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier? No, because y10 can be at most 8, so y10=9 impossible. So minimal H is 3.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it works with no collisions.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 8 car: tail=-23, head=-12, s=4, at T=10: [-23 +4(1), -12+4(1)] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, freeway 7: same car, at T=9: [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, but I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the player might be on other rows during the sequence.\n\nIn this case, only on y=7 at turn 9, y=8 at turn 10, y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut y=9 no issue.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 10 on y=8, are there any cars? Freeway 8 has one car, but span doesn't cover 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 8 has only one car, as above.\n\nBut let me list all freeways to be sure.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is a reason to go down or something, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nMaybe on some rows there are cars that might hit, but here it seems fine.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 9, I could stay or go down, but that would delay, so not good.\n\nSo with H=3, actions: turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nThen y10=8, y11=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=3, actions at t=9,10,11? No.\n\nActions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=3, t=0,1,2.\n\na_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9+3-1} = y_{11} =9.\n\nBut a_{11} is the action at turn 11, which sets y_{12}, but we don't care, since we reach at turn 11.\n\nIn this case, with a9=U, a10=U, then y10=8 (after a9), y11=9 (after a10).\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y11=9.\n\nThen a11 is taken, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 11.\n\nIn the action sequence, we need to specify a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nFor H=3, a9, a10, a11.\n\nBut a11 is not necessary for reaching y11=9, since y11 is set by a10.\n\nBut the sequence must have H actions, up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThen after that, at turn t1+H, position is set, but we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nIn this case, with a9=U, a10=U, then y10=8, y11=9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{11} for H=3.\n\nNow, what about a11? I need to specify an action, but since we have reached, I can set it to S or something.\n\nBut the minimal H might be less if I can reach earlier, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps with different path.\n\nFor example, if at turn 9, I go up to y=8, but at turn 10 on y=8, if there was a collision, but there isn't.\n\nSuppose I go down to y=6 at some point, but that would take more turns to get back, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nNow, but in this case, with a9=U, a10=U, and then a11, I need to choose a11, but since y11=9, and I am at goal, I can stay or whatever, but the position at turn 11 is already 9, so for the sequence, I can set a11 to S, for example.\n\nBut the actions are only for moving, but S is allowed.\n\nPerhaps I don't need a11, but H must be such that at turn t1+H-1, I am at 9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{9+2-1}=y10, which can be at most 8, not 9, so impossible.\n\nH=3 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for H=3, I must specify three actions.\n\nBut with two actions, I can have y11=9, but y11 is set by a10, so for y11=9, I need a10=U with y10=8.\n\ny10 is set by a9.\n\nSo with a9 and a10, I can reach y11=9, but the position at turn t1+H-1 for H=2 would be y10=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y10=9, impossible from y9=7.\n\nSo yes, H=3.\n\nNow, in the actions, for H=3, actions at t=9,10,11.\n\na9: I take U, so y10=8.\n\na10: I take U, so y11=9.\n\na11: I need to take some action, but y11=9, and I am at goal, so I can take S, for stay.\n\nThen y12=9, but we don't care.\n\nNow, at turn 11, when I am on y=11? y11=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check, or even if it were, no cars.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 10, I was on y=8, which is fine.\n\nBut let me double-check if at turn 10 on y=8, is there any car collision.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car, as above, span at T=10: [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nBut freeway 8 has cars? In the state, freeway 8: (-12,-23,right,4), yes.\n\nBut is there only one? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 at turn 9: freeway 7: same car, at T=9: [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nBut freeway 7 has one car: (-12,-23,right,4), same as above.\n\nBut in the list, freeway 7 and 8 both have this single car.\n\nNow, but what about other freeways? I don't care as long as I am not on them when collision.\n\nBut at turn 10, I am on y=8, so only care about freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly at turn 9, only freeway 7.\n\nNow, but there might be an issue if I need to pass through other rows, but here I go directly.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at different times, but at turn 10 it is fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it with H=3, but maybe I need to avoid something, but here no.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 8 might be at 0 at some other time, but at turn 10 it is not.\n\nFor example, when is 0 in the span for freeway 8 car.\n\nSpan: [ -23 +4(T-9), -12 +4(T-9) ]\n\nSet this interval contains 0.\n\nSo -23 +4(T-9) <= 0 <= -12 +4(T-9)\n\nSince right-moving, tail to head.\n\nSo min = -23 +4(T-9), max = -12 +4(T-9)\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nSo -23 +4(T-9) <=0 and -12 +4(T-9) >=0\n\nFirst: -23 +4(T-9) <=0 => 4(T-9) <=23 => T-9 <= 23/4=5.75, so T-9 <=5 since integer, T<=14\n\nSecond: -12 +4(T-9) >=0 => 4(T-9) >=12 => T-9 >=3, T>=12\n\nSo for T from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 is in span.\n\nAt turn 10, T=10, not in 12-14, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but I am not on them.\n\nNow, at turn 10, I am on y=8, which is fine.\n\nThen I go up to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a9=U, a10=U, a11=S, for example.\n\nBut a11 can be anything, since we reached.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence if I start from different action.\n\nSuppose at turn 9, I take S, stay at y=7.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am still on y=7.\n\nCheck collision at turn 10 on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 car: at T=10, span [-19,-8], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, I take U to y=8.\n\nThen at turn 11, on y=8.\n\nNow freeway 8 at T=11: span [-23 +4(11-9), -12 +4(11-9)] = [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nThen at turn 11, take U to y=9.\n\nThen y12=9, but now I reach at turn 12, with H larger.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{9+H-1} =9.\n\nIf I reach at turn 12, y12=9, then 9+H-1=12, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nWorse than H=3.\n\nIf I go up immediately, I reach at turn 11.\n\nSo better to go up directly.\n\nBut in the direct up, with H=3, it works.\n\nBut in the car list, there are other freeways, but since I only go through y=7 and y=8, and briefly, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6, for example, but I am not on it.\n\nAt turn 9, I am on y=7, freeway 7 has car, but safe.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=8, freeway 8 has car, safe.\n\nNo other rows.\n\nBut the player starts at y=7, which is a freeway, but we checked.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to write the sequence.\n\nBut for H=3, actions at turn 9,10,11.\n\na9: U\n\na10: U\n\na11: S (or U or D, but since at y=9, U or D might go out of bound, but y=9, if U, y10=10, but y=10 not exist, vertical axis y=0 to 9, so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so at y=9, U would be invalid? But the game dynamics say y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1}=10 not in [0,9], so probably not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, D to y=8, or S.\n\nSo at y=9, only S or D, but D would move away from goal, but since we are already at goal, probably S is fine.\n\nIn this case, since we need y_{t1+H-1}=9, and for t=11, y11=9, then a11 can be S.\n\nIf I set a11 to D, y12=8, but y12 is not the position at t=11, position at t=11 is y11=9.\n\nThen a11 sets y12, but we don't care about later positions.\n\nSo for the sequence, a11 can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in action, only U,D,S allowed.\n\nNow, but in my sequence, with a9=U, a10=U, a11=S.\n\nThen positions: turn 9: y=7, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, safe.\n\nThen at turn 11, action S, y12=9.\n\nBut we reached at turn 11.\n\nNow, but is there a problem with other cars?\n\nFor example, freeway 2 has a car with speed 12.\n\nFreeway 2: one car (36,25,right,12)\n\nAt T, span [25 +12(T-9), 36+12(T-9)]\n\n0 in span when 25+12(T-9) <=0 <=36+12(T-9)\n\nFirst inequality: 25+12(T-9) <=0 => 12(T-9) <= -25? Since T-9 >=0, left side >=25>0, so never <=0.\n\n25 +12(T-9) >=25 >0 for T>=9, so min >0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, other cars on other freeways.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 cars: first car, at T: [-23 +4(T-9), -12+4(T-9)]\n\n0 in span when -23+4(T-9) <=0 and -12+4(T-9) >=0\n\nAs before, T-9 >=3 and T-9 <=5.75, so T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly for other cars with the same.\n\nBut since I am not on those freeways at those times, no issue.\n\nIn my path, I only on y=7 and y=8, at turns 9 and 10.\n\nAt turn 9, T=9, not 12-14.\n\nTurn 10, T=10, not 12-14.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nH=3.\n\nActions: turn 9: U, turn 10: U, turn 11: S.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U for turn 9)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} (U for turn 10)\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} (S for turn 11)\n\nt_1=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can do with less, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I was moving, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 9, I take no action, but I have to take actions.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps from y=7, I go down to y=6, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if on y=8 at turn 10 there was a collision, but there isn't.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at other times, but at turn 10 it is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at turn 10 I go to y=9 directly, but I can't, only one step.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=3 with U,U,S is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, for a11, I put S, but since y=9, S is fine.\n\nI could put D, but that would move down, not necessary.\n\nS is better.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to specify.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nIn freeway 2, there is a car with speed 12, but as I said, min at T=9 is 25>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways with multiple cars, like freeway 1, but I am not on it.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 at turn T: three cars.\n\nFirst car: as above, covers 0 at T=12,13,14.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4), at t1=9, span [13,24], at T [13+4(T-9),24+4(T-9)]\n\n0 in span? 13+4(T-9) <=0? Since min=13+4(T-9) >=13>0 for T>=9, so never <=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (60,49,right,4), min=49+4(T-9)>=49>0, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways with similar cars.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 same as freeway 1, cars never cover 0 except the first type, but only at T=12-14.\n\nFreeway 3: one car like first, covers 0 at T=12-14.\n\nBut again, not on those rows.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have the car that covers 0 at T=12-14, but at turn 10, T=10<12, so not covered.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, with actions U at t=9, U at t=10, S at t=11.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=11, action S.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: S }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so since t_1=9, it should be Turn 9: U, etc.\n\nIn the box, probably write the turns.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" , so use the numbers.\n\nIn the instruction: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 8 has a car, but at turn 10 it is at [-19,-8], fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any car on y=8 that might be at 0 at turn 10? No.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait, but no need.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 3, as it takes at least two moves to go from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) (since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most ±1), and the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\) must be 9. With \\(H = 3\\), the actions are taken at turns 9, 10, and 11, and \\(y_{11} = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 9 (current turn)**: Action \\(a_9 = U\\) (move up). This sets \\(y_{10} = 8\\).\n- **Turn 10**: Action \\(a_{10} = U\\) (move up). This sets \\(y_{11} = 9\\).\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(a_{11} = S\\) (stay). Since the goal \\(y_{11} = 9\\) is reached, staying is safe and valid.\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **At turn 9 (y = 7)**: The car on freeway 7 is \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 4)\\). At \\(T = 9\\), the span is \\([-23 + 4(9-9), -12 + 4(9-9)] = [-23, -12]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-23, -12]\\), no collision occurs.\n- **At turn 10 (y = 8)**: The car on freeway 8 is \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 4)\\). At \\(T = 10\\), the span is \\([-23 + 4(10-9), -12 + 4(10-9)] = [-19, -8]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-19, -8]\\), no collision occurs.\n- **At turn 11 (y = 9)**: There are no cars on \\(y = 9\\), so no collision is possible.\n\nNo other freeways or turns are involved in the path, and the sequence avoids all collisions. Any alternative path (e.g., moving down or staying longer) would require more turns, so \\(H = 3\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} }",
