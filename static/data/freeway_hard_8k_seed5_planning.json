        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,0) at turn t1 = 0 and want to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. We are only concerned with the cars on the freeway corresponding to the y-coordinate we are on at a given turn.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (where k = y_T) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nMoreover, when moving from y to y' at turn T, note that:\n- At turn T, we are on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T).\n- At turn T+1, we will be on y' (so we check the car on freeway y' at turn T+1).\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=0.\n\nCar states at turn 0:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12)\n  Since it's right-moving, the car moves to the right. At time t, the span is [37 + 12*t, 48 + 12*t]\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5,6: each has one car: (head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6)\n  Right-moving: at time t, span = [-59 + 6*t, -48 + 6*t]\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: each has three cars:\n  Car1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> span at time t: [-59+6t, -48+6t]\n  Car2: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> span at time t: [-23+6t, -12+6t]\n  Car3: (24, 13, right, 6) -> note: head=24, tail=13 -> this is also right-moving? But note the head is greater than tail? Actually, in the representation, for right-moving cars, the head is the front (which is the larger coordinate) and tail is the back (smaller). So the span is [13+6t, 24+6t] for this car.\n\nBut wait, the representation says for right-moving: [tail, head] becomes [tail + s*t, head + s*t]. However, in the table, for freeway 7 and 8, the third car is (24,13,right,6). This means head=24, tail=13? Then the initial span is [13,24] and then at time t: [13+6t, 24+6t].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> head=-12, tail=-23? Then the initial span is [-23,-12] and at time t: [-23+6t, -12+6t].\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> initial span [-59,-48] -> at time t: [-59+6t, -48+6t].\n\nWe are at turn 0 at (0,0). We need to get to (0,9). We can only move up, down, or stay. But note that we start at y=0 and want to go to y=9, so we must move upward overall.\n\nSince we are at y=0 at turn0, and we want to minimize the number of turns, we would prefer to go up as much as possible. However, we must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nNote that at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars (freeways are only from 1 to 8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nThe challenge is the freeways in between.\n\nWe can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So the minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait (use S) or even go down to avoid a collision.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions from turn0 to turn H-1 such that at turn H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last action at turn t1+H-1 (and then we are at y=9 at the next state? Actually, note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=H-1, and after applying the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we get the position at turn t1+H. We require that position to be (0,9). But note the update:\n\n  At turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t. Then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo if we start at turn0: y0 = 0.\nAfter a0, we get y1 = y0 + delta(a0).\nAfter a1, we get y2 = y1 + delta(a1).\n...\nAfter a_{H-1}, we get y_H = y_{H-1} + delta(a_{H-1}) = 9.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at turn H.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: at each turn t (from t0 to t0+H-1) we are at y_t and we must avoid the cars on freeway y_t at that turn.\n\nSince we start at y0=0 (safe) and end at y_H=9 (safe), we only worry about the turns when we are at y_t in {1,2,...,8}.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each car the times at which the car covers the position 0.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, the car's span on the freeway y_T must not include 0.\n\nSo for a given freeway k and a given car on that freeway, we need to know at which turns T the car's span includes 0.\n\nHowever, we are going to traverse the freeways at specific times. We are in control of when we are on which freeway.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence.\n\nSince H must be at least 9, we can try H=9 and see if we can go straight up without collision. If not, then we try H=10, and so on.\n\nBut note: we can also move down sometimes, so H might be more than 9.\n\nHowever, minimal H is desired.\n\nLet me check the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: [37+12t, 48+12t] at time t (from t0=0). We need this interval to not contain 0 at the time we are on freeway1.\n\nBut note: 37+12t >= 37 at t=0, and increasing. Since 37>0, the entire interval is positive and increasing. So 0 is never in the interval. Therefore, freeway1 is always safe? \n\nWait: at time t, the car is at [37+12t, 48+12t]. Since 37+12t >= 37 >0, so indeed 0 is never covered. So freeway1 is safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 2: car: [-59+6t, -48+6t]. We need to check when 0 is in this interval.\n\n  -59+6t <= 0 <= -48+6t\n  => 6t <= 59 and 6t >= 48\n  => t >= 48/6 = 8, and t <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSo t=8,9,10? But note: t is integer.\n\nAt t=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes, because -11<=0<=0? Actually, the interval is [a,b] inclusive? The problem says \"span\", and we have inclusive endpoints? The representation [h, tau] for left-moving and [tau, h] for right-moving? Actually, the update rule says the entire span moves. And collision if 0 is in the span. So we assume inclusive.\n\nAt t=8: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0]. Since 0 is the upper bound, it is included. So unsafe at t=8.\n\nAt t=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? Yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n\nAt t=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> does not include 0.\n\nSo freeway2 is unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same car? The table says freeway3 has the same car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as freeway2? Then unsafe at the same times: t=8,9.\n\nFreeway4: same -> unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway5: same -> unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway6: same -> unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway7: three cars.\n\nCar1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as above: unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nCar2: (-12,-23,right,6): span at time t: [-23+6t, -12+6t]\n\nCheck when 0 is in this interval:\n\n  -23+6t <= 0 <= -12+6t\n  => 6t <= 23 and 6t >= 12\n  => t >= 2 and t <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nSo t=2,3,4? \n\nAt t=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> unsafe (includes 0)\nAt t=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> unsafe (0 in between)\nAt t=4: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo car2 on freeway7 is unsafe at t=2,3.\n\nCar3: (24,13,right,6): span at time t: [13+6t,24+6t]\n\nWe need 0 in [13+6t,24+6t]. But 13+6t >=13>0 for all t>=0, so never includes 0. Safe.\n\nTherefore, freeway7 has:\n  unsafe from car1 at t=8,9\n  unsafe from car2 at t=2,3\n\nSo overall for freeway7: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same three cars? The table says the same: so same unsafe times: t=2,3,8,9.\n\nNow, freeway1 is safe at all times, as established.\n\nWe are at turn0 at y0=0.\n\nWe must go through freeways 1 to 8. We are at y0=0 (safe). Then we will be at:\n\nTurn1: we choose an action at turn0 -> we can go to y1=1 (if we choose U) or stay at 0 (S) or go to -1? but y must be in [0,9] -> so we cannot go below 0. Similarly, above 9 is not allowed. So at y0=0, we can only choose U or S. Similarly at y=9, we can only choose D or S.\n\nBut we want to go to 9, so we must eventually go up.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we want to go as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times on each freeway.\n\nWe are going to traverse the freeways in order? But note: we can also move down. So we might go up to y=3, then down to y=2, then up again, etc.\n\nBut that would take more turns. Since we want minimal H, we should avoid detours if possible.\n\nLet me try to see if we can do H=9: that is, we go up every turn.\n\nSequence of positions:\n\nTurn0: y0=0 (safe)\nTurn1: we are at y1=1 (freeway1) at time t=1 -> freeway1 is safe at all times? So safe.\nTurn2: y2=2 (freeway2) at time t=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at t=8,9 -> safe at t=2? \n        But freeway2 is unsafe only at t=8,9? So at t=2, safe.\nTurn3: y3=3 (freeway3) at time t=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at t=8,9 -> safe at t=3.\nTurn4: y4=4 (freeway4) at time t=4 -> safe (freeway4 unsafe only at t=8,9).\nTurn5: y5=5 (freeway5) at time t=5 -> safe.\nTurn6: y6=6 (freeway6) at time t=6 -> safe.\nTurn7: y7=7 (freeway7) at time t=7 -> freeway7: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9 -> so t=7 is safe? \n        Because unsafe at 2,3,8,9 -> 7 is not in that set -> safe.\nTurn8: y8=8 (freeway8) at time t=8 -> freeway8: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9 -> t=8 is unsafe.\n\nSo at turn8 (which is the 8th turn, counting from turn0 as the start) we are at y8=8 and time t=8 -> and freeway8 is unsafe at t=8. So we collide.\n\nTherefore, going straight up in 9 turns fails at turn8.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway8 at turn8.\n\nWhat can we do? We can slow down so that we are not on freeway8 at turn8, but at a safe time.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at a safe freeway for some turns.\n\nWe note that freeway1 is always safe. Also, freeways 2-6 are safe except at t=8,9. Freeway7 and 8 are unsafe at t=2,3,8,9.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway8 at t=8 or t=9. Similarly, avoid freeway7 at t=8 or t9? Actually, freeway7 is unsafe at t=8,9 as well.\n\nBut note: we are going to be on each freeway at a specific time.\n\nWe must also avoid freeway7 at t=2,3? But we are going to be on freeway7 at a time that we can control.\n\nLet me try to adjust the timing.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at turn H. The minimal H might be 10.\n\nLet me try H=10.\n\nWe have 10 actions (from turn0 to turn9) and we end at turn10 at y10=9.\n\nWe are at y0=0.\n\nWe need to assign a time for each freeway from 1 to 8. We must be on freeway k at exactly one turn? Actually, we are on a freeway at every turn from 1 to 10? Not exactly: we might skip a freeway if we jump over? But we can only change by 1 per turn, so we must pass through each integer y from 0 to 9. But note: we might stay at a freeway for multiple turns.\n\nWe are at:\n\nturn0: y0=0\nturn1: y1 = ?\n...\nturn10: y10=9.\n\nWe must have y_{t} for t from 0 to 10.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- On freeway1: always safe.\n- On freeway2,3,4,5,6: unsafe at t=8,9.\n- On freeway7: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9.\n- On freeway8: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9.\n\nWe are going to be on freeway2 to 6 for at least one turn each, and freeway7 and 8 for at least one turn each.\n\nWe want to minimize the total turns, but we are trying H=10.\n\nWe have 10 turns (t=0 to t=9) and we are at positions y0 to y9, and then y10=9.\n\nWe need to assign the y_t for t=0 to 9, with y0=0, y10=9, and |y_{t+1}-y_t|<=1.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway k at an unsafe time for that freeway.\n\nSpecifically, if at time t we are at y_t = k, then k must be safe at time t.\n\nWe know:\n\nk=1: safe for all t.\nk=2,3,4,5,6: unsafe at t=8,9 -> safe for t<=7 and t>=10? But our t only goes from 0 to 9 (since we have 10 actions, the last action is at t=9, so the last position we are at during the moves is at t=9). So for k=2-6, we must avoid t=8 and 9? But note: t=8 and t=9 are within our range.\n\nActually, we are at:\n\nAt time t (the turn index, starting at 0), we are at position y_t.\n\nFor k=2,3,4,5,6: we must not be at that freeway at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly, for k=7: we must avoid t=2,3,8,9.\nFor k=8: we must avoid t=2,3,8,9.\n\nWe also note that we must pass through freeway7 and 8, and we cannot be there at t=2,3,8,9. So what times are available for freeway7 and 8? Only t=0,1,4,5,6,7? But t=0: we start at y0=0, so we are not on freeway7 at t=0. Similarly, t=1: we might be on freeway1? We can be on freeway7 only at t>=? Actually, we start at 0, so the earliest we can be on freeway7 is at t=7 (if we go straight up: 0->1->2->...->7 at t=7). But we have to avoid t=2,3,8,9. So for freeway7, we can be at t=4,5,6,7? But we cannot get to freeway7 at t=4: because from 0 to 7 in 4 turns? That would require going up 7 in 4 moves: not possible (max 4 moves: 0->1->2->3->4). So we cannot be at freeway7 (y=7) at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5: we can be at y=5? But we want freeway7. The earliest we can be at y=7 is t=7: 0->1 (t1), 1->2 (t2), 2->3 (t3), 3->4 (t4), 4->5 (t5), 5->6 (t6), 6->7 (t7): so at turn7 we are at y7=7.\n\nSimilarly, the latest we can be at y=7 is? We have to get to y=9 at turn10. So from y=7 at turn t, we need at least 2 more moves to get to 9 (if we go up twice). So we must be at y=7 by turn8 at the latest? Because at turn8: if we are at y7, then we can go to y8 at turn9 and y9 at turn10.\n\nBut we cannot be at freeway7 at t=8 (unsafe). So we must be at freeway7 at t=7? Because t=7 is the only available safe time? (t=4,5,6,7 are safe for freeway7, but t=4,5,6 are too early to reach y=7?).\n\nLet me check:\n\nTo be at y=7 at time t, we need at least 7 moves upward? Not exactly: we start at y0=0. After 7 moves (if all up) we are at y7=7. So at turn7 we can be at y7=7.\n\nCan we be at y=7 at an earlier time? Only if we can skip some freeways? But we must go through each freeway. We cannot jump. So the earliest time to be at y=7 is t=7.\n\nSimilarly, we can delay being at y=7 by staying at lower freeways. But note we have to reach y=9 by turn10.\n\nNow, we cannot be at freeway7 at t=8 (unsafe) and we cannot be at freeway7 at t=7? Wait, we just said at t=7 we can be at y=7. And t=7 is safe for freeway7? Yes, because unsafe times are 2,3,8,9 -> 7 is safe.\n\nSo we plan to be at freeway7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: we must be at y=8 at some point. We cannot be at t=8 or t=9 (unsafe). And we cannot be at t=2,3 (which are too early). So what times are available? t=0,1,4,5,6,7? But we are at y0=0, so we cannot be at y=8 at t=0. At t=1: we are at y1 (which is 0 or 1) -> not 8. The earliest we can be at y=8 is t=8: 0->1->...->8 at t=8. But t=8 is unsafe. The next possibility: we can be at y=8 at t=9? But then we can go to y=9 at t=10. However, t=9 is unsafe for freeway8.\n\nSo we must avoid t=8 and t=9. Therefore, we need to be at freeway8 at a time that is not 2,3,8,9. The only possibilities are t=4,5,6,7.\n\nBut can we be at y=8 at t=7? That would require going from 0 to 8 in 7 moves: which is possible: 0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8: that would take 8 moves? Let me count:\n\nturn0: start at 0\nturn1: y1=1\nturn2: y2=2\nturn3: y3=3\nturn4: y4=4\nturn5: y5=5\nturn6: y6=6\nturn7: y7=7\nturn8: y8=8\n\nSo at turn8 we are at y8=8. To be at y8=8 at turn7, we would have to be at 8 at the end of turn7, meaning we start at 0 and in 7 moves we go up 8? Impossible because we can only go up 7 in 7 moves (max 1 per move). So we cannot be at y=8 before t=8.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=8 at t=8,9,10,... but we are constrained by the end: we must be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at either turn8 or turn9? Because:\n\nIf we are at y8 at turn8, then we can go to y9 at turn9 and then we are at y9 at turn9? But we require to be at y9 at turn10? Actually, we have 10 actions: from turn0 to turn9, so we have 10 moves? Then we end at y10.\n\nWe start at turn0: y0=0.\nAfter 10 moves (turn0 to turn9), we have y10.\n\nWe must be at y10=9.\n\nSo the positions: y0, y1, ..., y10.\n\nWe are at y=8 at some turn t (between 0 and 10). We require that at that turn t, we are not at an unsafe time for freeway8.\n\nBut the unsafe times for freeway8 are t=2,3,8,9.\n\nWe can be at y=8 at t=8? unsafe.\nt=9? unsafe.\nt=10? But note: we are at turn10 at position y10=9, so we are not at freeway8 at turn10. The last time we are at freeway8 is when y_t=8, and t must be between 0 and 9? Because at turn10 we are at y10=9.\n\nSo we must be at freeway8 at a turn t in {0,1,...,9} and avoid t=2,3,8,9. The available t are 0,1,4,5,6,7.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=8 at t=0 (we start at 0) or t=1 (we are at y1<=1). The earliest we can be at y=8 is t=8? But that is unsafe. How about t=7? We just saw we cannot be at y=8 at t=7 because it takes 8 moves to get from 0 to 8.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway8 at any safe time? This is a problem.\n\nBut wait: we can stay at a freeway for multiple turns. So we can be at freeway8 at a time earlier than 8? No, because we cannot get to 8 before 8 moves. But we can be at freeway8 at a time later than 8? For example, we can wait at a lower freeway and then go up, so we might be at freeway8 at t=10? But t=10 is not in our range (we only go up to t=9 for the moves). We must be at freeway8 by turn9 at the latest? Because we have to get to 9 by turn10.\n\nSo we must be at freeway8 at turn8 or turn9? But both are unsafe.\n\nThis suggests that we cannot avoid freeway8 at an unsafe time? Then we must use more than 10 turns.\n\nLet me try H=11. Then we have 11 moves (turn0 to turn10) and we end at turn11 at y11=9.\n\nNow we are at freeway8 at a turn t in {0,1,...,10}. We avoid t=2,3,8,9. So available t: 0,1,4,5,6,7,10.\n\nWe cannot be at t=0,1 (too early). We can be at t=10? But then we are at freeway8 at turn10, and then we go to freeway9 at turn11? But we have to be at freeway9 at turn11? Actually, we are at y10=8 at turn10, then we go to y11=9 at turn11. So at turn10 we are at freeway8.\n\nIs t=10 safe for freeway8? The unsafe times are 2,3,8,9. 10 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway7: we need to avoid t=2,3,8,9. So available t: 0,1,4,5,6,7,10,11? But we are only concerned up to turn10 (because at turn10 we are at y10, and we are not at turn11 in the moves? Actually, we are at turn10 at y10, and we are at freeway7 only if y10=7). But we are going to be at freeway7 at some turn t. The unsafe times are 2,3,8,9. So safe at t=0,1,4,5,6,7,10,11,... We are only going to be at freeway7 at a turn between 0 and 10.\n\nWe must be at freeway7 before freeway8. We can be at freeway7 at t=7 and then freeway8 at t=10? But how? We need to get from 7 to 8: that takes at least one move. But we have from turn7 to turn10: 3 moves. So we can stay at freeway7 for two turns and then move up.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 2-6: they are unsafe at t=8,9. So we must avoid being on them at t=8 or t=9.\n\nBut with H=11, we have turns from 0 to 10. So we can avoid t=8,9 for freeways2-6.\n\nLet me try to build a plan for H=11.\n\nWe need to reach y11=9.\n\nWe can be at freeway8 at t=10 (safe). So at turn10, we are at y10=8. Then we go up at turn10 to y11=9.\n\nWe need to be at freeway7 at a safe time. We can be at freeway7 at t=7 (safe). Then from freeway7 (y=7) at t=7, we can stay for two turns? Then we would be:\n\nAt turn7: y7=7 (freeway7, safe at t=7)\nturn8: we choose S -> y8=7 (but now at turn8, we are at freeway7 -> unsafe! because freeway7 is unsafe at t=8).\n\nSo we cannot stay at freeway7 at t=8.\n\nWe can move up? But then we would be at freeway8 at t=8 -> unsafe for freeway8.\n\nSo we must leave freeway7 at turn7? But we are at y=7 at turn7, and we want to be at y=8 at turn10. We have three moves: turn7,8,9.\n\nWe can do:\n\nturn7: y7=7 -> safe (t=7)\nturn8: move down to y8=6? Then we are at freeway6 at t=8 -> but freeway6 is unsafe at t=8? Yes, because freeway2-6 are unsafe at t=8,9. So at t=8, freeway6 is unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, we can move down to a freeway that is safe? But freeway1 is safe, but we are at y=7, moving down to y=6 (freeway6) -> unsafe at t=8.\n\nWe could move down to freeway5? Same problem.\n\nBut note: we can be at freeway7 at a time other than t=7? For example, at t=10? But then we would be at y=7 at turn10, and then we have to get to y=9 by turn11: but that requires two moves: from 7 to 8 at turn10 and 8 to 9 at turn11? But then we are at freeway8 at turn10? And we wanted to be at freeway8 at turn10? That is safe. But then we are at freeway7 at turn10? No: at turn10, we are at y10. If we are at freeway7 at turn10, then we are at y10=7. Then we go to y11=8? and then we need another turn to go to 9 -> that would be H=12.\n\nBut we are trying H=11.\n\nWe need to be at freeway8 at turn10. So we must be at freeway7 before turn10. The moves:\n\nWe need to be at freeway7 at a safe time. Safe times for freeway7: t not in {2,3,8,9}. So t=0,1,4,5,6,7,10? But we are at freeway7 at turn10? Then we are at y10=7, but we want to be at y10=8? Contradiction.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway7 at turn10 if we want to be at freeway8 at turn10.\n\nTherefore, we must be at freeway7 at an earlier safe time: t=4,5,6,7.\n\nBut we saw that we can be at freeway7 at t=7.\n\nThen at turn7: y7=7.\n\nNow we have to get to y10=8 (so we need to go from 7 to 8 in three moves: turns 7,8,9).\n\nWe can:\n\nOption 1: go up immediately? But then at turn8: y8=8 -> unsafe (freeway8 at t=8).\n\nOption 2: stay at 7 at turn7? But then at turn8: we are at y8=7 -> unsafe (freeway7 at t=8).\n\nOption 3: move down to y8=6 at turn7? Then at turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6 at t=8: unsafe.\n\nWe could move down to a freeway that is safe at t=8? But freeway1 is safe, but we are at 7, moving down to 6 -> freeway6 is unsafe at t=8.\n\nWhat if we move down further? But then we use turns and we have to come back.\n\nWe have three moves: we can do:\n\nturn7: move down to 6 -> unsafe at turn7? No, at turn7 we are moving from 7 to 6: at turn7, we are at y7=7 (safe). Then after the move, at turn8 we are at y8=6. But at turn8, we are at freeway6, which is unsafe at t=8.\n\nAlternatively, we can move down at turn7 to 7? stay -> then turn8 we are at 7 and unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway6,7,8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut freeway1 is safe at all times. So we could go down to freeway1 and wait there until the unsafe times for the upper freeways are over.\n\nFor example, we can go up to freeway7 at t=7 (safe), then at turn7 move down to 6? but unsafe at t=8. Or move down to 5? same problem: freeway5 at t=8 is unsafe.\n\nBut if we move down multiple steps, we can get to freeway1.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAt turn7: y7=7 (safe) -> action: move down to 6? then at turn8: y8=6 -> unsafe (freeway6 at t=8).\n\nInstead, at turn7: move down to 6? then at turn8: we are at 6 and unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nAt turn7: move down twice? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nWe have to do:\n\nturn7: from 7 move down to 6 -> then at turn8, we are at 6 and that is unsafe.\n\nWhat if at turn6 we are not at 6? Let me plan the whole thing.\n\nWe want to be at freeway8 at turn10 (safe).\n\nWe also want to be at freeway7 at a safe time, say t=7.\n\nBut then we have to get from 7 at t=7 to 8 at t=10.\n\nWe need to avoid freeway6,5,4,3,2,7,8 at t=8 and t=9? But freeway1 is safe.\n\nSo we can go down to freeway1 and wait there during t=8 and t=9, then come back up.\n\nBut we only have three moves: turn7,8,9 to get from 7 to 8.\n\nIf we go down, we get further away.\n\nSo we need more than three moves? Then H must be more than 11.\n\nLet me try H=12.\n\nThen we have 12 moves: from turn0 to turn11, and we end at turn12 at y12=9.\n\nWe can be at freeway8 at turn10 or turn11? But freeway8 is unsafe at t=8,9 -> safe at t=10,11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7: safe at t=10,11? But we need to be at freeway7 before freeway8.\n\nPlan to be at freeway8 at turn10 or 11.\n\nWe can be at freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\nThen we have to be at freeway7 at a safe time. We can be at freeway7 at turn7 or turn10? But if we are at freeway7 at turn10, then we are at y10=7, then we go to y11=8 and y12=9. But then we are at freeway8 at turn11: which is safe (t=11 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\nSo we can:\n\n- Be at freeway7 at turn10: safe? because t=10 is safe for freeway7 (since 10 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\n- Then at turn10: move up to 8 -> at turn11: y11=8 (freeway8 at t=11) -> safe.\n- Then at turn11: move up to 9 -> y12=9.\n\nNow, we need to get from 0 to 7 in 10 moves? That is easy: we can even go slower.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeways 2-6 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAnd freeway7 and 8 at t=8,9 we are not on them? We will be on freeway7 only at turn10? and freeway8 at turn11.\n\nSo we must ensure that during turns 8 and 9, we are not on freeway2-6? Because they are unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nWe can be on freeway1 (always safe) or freeway0 or freeway9? But we are not at freeway0 (y=0) or freeway9 (y=9) until the end. But freeway0 and freeway9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nActually, the player can be at y=0 or y=9 at any time and it's safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=0 or y=1 (freeway1, safe) or y=9 (safe) during turns 8 and 9.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=7 by turn10.\n\nSo at turn10: y10=7.\n\nWe start at y0=0.\n\nWe have 10 moves to go from 0 to 7. That means we can have 7 moves up and 3 moves that are not up (either down or stay) in any order, as long as we never go below 0.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions on freeways 2-6 at turns 8 and 9.\n\nSo at turn8 and turn9, we must be at a safe freeway: which are freeways 0,1,9 (but 9 is too high at this point) or freeway7 and 8? But freeway7 and 8 are unsafe at t=8,9? So we cannot be on them. Therefore, at turns 8 and 9, we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nBut we are going to be at y=7 at turn10. So at turn9, we must be at y=6 or y=7? Because from turn9 to turn10, we can move up from 6 to 7 or stay at 7.\n\nBut if we are at y=7 at turn9, then we are on freeway7 at turn9: unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at turn9, then we are on freeway6 at turn9: unsafe (because freeway6 is unsafe at t=9).\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway6 or freeway7 at turn9.\n\nTherefore, at turn9, we must be at y<=5 or y>=8? But we are aiming for y=7 at turn10, so we must be at y=6 or y=7 at turn9. But both are unsafe.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, at turn9 we could be at y=7 and then at turn10 we move up to 8? But then we are at freeway7 at turn9: unsafe.\n\nOr at turn9 we are at y=6 and move up to 7 at turn10: then freeway6 at turn9: unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway2-8 at turn9? But freeway2-8 are all unsafe at turn9? \n\n- Freeway2-6: unsafe at t=9 (since they are unsafe at t=8,9).\n- Freeway7 and 8: unsafe at t=9.\n\nSo the only safe freeways at turn9 are freeway0,1,9.\n\nWe can be at y=0,1, or 9 at turn9.\n\nBut we are at turn9, and we want to be at y=7 at turn10. How can we get from y=0,1, or 9 to y=7 in one move? Impossible.\n\nThis suggests that we must avoid being on any freeway from 2 to 8 at turns 8 and 9. But then at turn8 and turn9, we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nBut then how to get to y=7 by turn10? We cannot.\n\nUnless we are at y=1 at turn9, then at turn10 we move to y=2? But we need to be at y=7 at turn10.\n\nWe must be at y=7 at turn10, so at turn9 we must be at y=6,7, or 8. But all of these are on freeways 6,7,8, which are unsafe at turn9.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible to be at y=7 at turn10 without being on an unsafe freeway at turn9.\n\nPerhaps we can be at freeway8 at turn11 instead of turn10.\n\nWith H=12, we end at turn12 at y12=9.\n\nWe can be at freeway8 at turn11: safe (t=11 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\nThen we are at y11=8 at turn11, and then move to y12=9.\n\nWe need to be at freeway7 at a safe time. We can be at freeway7 at turn10: safe (t=10 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\nSo then:\n turn10: y10=7 (freeway7, safe)\n turn11: y11=8 (freeway8, safe)\n turn12: y12=9.\n\nNow, we need to get from 0 to 7 in 10 moves (turn0 to turn9).\n\nAnd we must avoid being on freeway2-8 at turns 8 and 9? because:\n- freeway2-6: unsafe at t=8,9\n- freeway7: unsafe at t=8,9\n- freeway8: unsafe at t=8,9\n\nSo at turn8 and turn9, we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nHow to do that and still reach y=7 by turn10?\n\nFrom turn0 to turn7: we have 7 moves to get to some state, and then at turn7 we must move to a safe haven for turns8 and 9.\n\nSpecifically, at turn7, after the move, we must be at y=0 or y=1, because at turn8 and turn9 we will be in the safe haven.\n\nThen at turn10, we need to be at y=7. So from turn7 to turn10, we have three moves.\n\nIf at turn7 we are at y=1, then we can:\n\n turn7: y7=1\n turn8: move up to 2? but then at turn8 we are at freeway2 -> unsafe at t=8.\n        or move down to 0? then at turn8: y8=0 (safe)\n turn9: from 0, move up to 1 -> y9=1 (safe)\n turn10: from 1, move up to 2 -> y10=2\n\nBut we need y10=7. We are only at 2.\n\nIf at turn7 we are at y=0:\n\n turn7: y7=0\n turn8: move up to 1 -> y8=1 (safe)\n turn9: move up to 2 -> y9=2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at t=9)\n\nOr stay at 0: then turn8: y8=0, safe; turn9: move up to 1 -> y9=1, safe; turn10: move up to 2 -> only 2.\n\nSo we only get to 2 at turn10, but we need 7.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nWe need to be at a higher freeway before turn7, then move down to 0 or 1 at turn7, but then we have only three moves to go up from 0 or 1 to 7, which is impossible (max 3 in three moves).\n\nTherefore, we must be at the safe haven (y=0 or 1) for turns 8 and 9, and then after turn9, we can move up quickly, but we have to reach y=7 by turn10 for our plan. But we can't.\n\n unless we change the plan.\n\nInstead of being at freeway7 at turn10, we can be at freeway7 earlier and then avoid the unsafe times by being in the safe haven during turns 8 and 9.\n\nFor example, we can be at freeway7 at turn7 (safe), then move down to freeway1 by turn8 and turn9, and then move up to freeway8 by turn11.\n\nLet me try with H=13.\n\nThen we end at turn13 at y13=9.\n\nWe can be at freeway8 at turn11 or turn12? Both are safe (t=11 and 12 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\nSay we are at freeway8 at turn11: then we have:\n turn11: y11=8 (safe)\n turn12: move up to 9 -> y12=9\n turn13: we don't need? No, we have actions from turn0 to turn12 to get to y13=9.\n\nActually, for H=13, we have 13 actions: turn0 to turn12, and then y13=9.\n\nWe can be at freeway8 at turn11: safe.\n\nWe need to be at freeway7 before that. We can be at freeway7 at turn7: safe.\n\nThen from turn7 to turn11, we have 4 moves.\n\nWe need to go from y=7 at turn7 to y=8 at turn11.\n\nWe can spend turns 8 and 9 in the safe haven (y=0 or 1).\n\nSo:\n\n turn7: y7=7 (safe)\n turn8: move down to 6 -> unsafe! because at turn8, freeway6 is unsafe.\n\nWe have to move down but we will hit unsafe freeways on the way down during turns 8 and 9.\n\nUnless we move down to freeway1 before turn8.\n\nSo we need to be at freeway1 by turn8.\n\nBut at turn7 we are at 7. We can move down one step per turn. At turn7: move down to 6 -> then at turn8, we are at 6 -> unsafe.\n\n move down twice in one turn? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be below freeway2 by turn8. freeway2 starts at y=2.\n\nSo if we are at y<=1 at turn8, then safe.\n\nSo from turn7: y7=7, we need to get to y<=1 by turn8. Impossible.\n\nWe can be at freeway7 at a time earlier than turn7, and then move down to the safe haven before turn8.\n\nFor example, be at freeway7 at turn6: is turn6 safe for freeway7? Yes, because unsafe times are 2,3,8,9.\n\nSo at turn6: y6=7 (safe)\n turn7: move down to 6 -> then at turn7, we are at freeway6 -> is freeway6 safe at turn7? freeway6 is unsafe only at t=8,9 -> so at t=7, safe.\n turn8: move down to 5 -> freeway5 at turn8: unsafe.\n\n still unsafe.\n\nWe have to move down to below freeway2 by turn8.\n\nSo we need to be at y<=1 at turn8.\n\n from turn6: y6=7\n turn7: move down to 6 -> safe (t=7 for freeway6)\n turn8: move down to 5 -> unsafe (freeway5 at t=8)\n\n not good.\n\n move down faster? turn6: from 7 to 5 in two moves? But we can only move one per turn.\n\n turn6: y6=7\n turn7: move down to 6\n turn8: move down to 5\n\n then at turn8, we are at 5 -> freeway5 at t=8: unsafe.\n\n to get to y=1 at turn8, we need to move down 6 steps in two moves: impossible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at y=1 is turn8+6 = turn14, which is too late.\n\nWe must avoid the unsafe freeways by not being on them at turns 8 and 9. But since we have to pass through them, and they are unsafe at turns 8 and 9, we must be on them at other times.\n\nFor freeway2-6, they are safe for t<8 or t>9. For freeway7 and 8, safe for t<8 or t>9 and also avoid t=2,3.\n\nSo for freeway2-6, we can be on them at t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nFor freeway7 and 8, we can be on them at t=0,1,4,5,6,7,10,11,...\n\nWe can try to be on freeway2-6 before turn8, and on freeway7 and 8 after turn9.\n\nFor example, be on freeway6 at turn7: safe.\n freeway7 at turn10: safe.\n freeway8 at turn11: safe.\n\nThen we need to get from freeway6 at turn7 to freeway7 at turn10.\n\nThat means from y=6 at turn7 to y=7 at turn10.\n\nWe have three moves: turn7,8,9.\n\nDuring turns 8 and 9, we must not be on freeway2-8. So we must be at y=0,1, or 9. But 9 is too high.\n\nSo we can move down to freeway1 and wait.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n turn7: y7=6 (safe for freeway6 because t=7<8)\n turn8: move down to 5 -> but then at turn8, freeway5 is unsafe.\n move down to 6? -> then at turn8, freeway6 is unsafe.\n\n move down to 7? -> then freeway7 at turn8: unsafe.\n\nSo we must move down to below freeway2, i.e., y<=1.\n\nBut from y=6 at turn7, we can move down to 5 at turn8: unsafe.\n\n unless we move down before turn8.\n\nSo we need to be at y<=1 at turn8.\n\n from y=6 at turn7, we can't get to y=1 in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must be at a lower freeway by turn7.\n\nFor example, be at freeway1 at turn7.\n\nThen we can:\n turn7: y7=1 (safe)\n turn8: S or U or D. If we stay at 1, safe.\n turn9: safe at 1.\n turn10: move up to 2 -> freeway2 at turn10: is it safe? freeway2 is unsafe only at t=8,9 -> t=10 is safe.\n turn11: move up to 3 -> freeway3 at turn11: safe (t=11>9)\n turn12: move up to 4\n turn13: move up to 5\n turn14: move up to 6\n turn15: move up to 7\n turn16: move up to 8\n turn17: move up to 9 -> then H=18, which is large.\n\nBut we want minimal turns.\n\nPerhaps we can be higher than freeway1 at turn7, but then we have to move down to freeway1 by turn8.\n\nFor example, if at turn7 we are at y=3, then at turn8 we can move down to 2 -> but freeway2 at turn8: unsafe.\n\n move down to 1: then at turn8, we are at 1 -> safe.\n\nSo from y=3 at turn7, we can move down to 1 in one move? No, only to 2.\n\nWe can only move one step.\n\nSo to get to y=1 at turn8, we must be at y=2 or y=1 or y=0 at turn7.\n\nBut if we are at y=2 at turn7, then we are at freeway2 at turn7: safe (t=7<8).\n\nThen at turn8: move down to 1 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn7 we are at y=1, then at turn8 we can stay at 1 or move down to 0.\n\nSo let's plan to be at y=2 at turn7: safe.\n turn8: move down to 1 -> safe.\n turn9: we can stay at 1 or move to 0 or move up to 2.\n\nBut we need to then go up to 7 by turn10? impossible.\n\nWe have to go up after turn9.\n\nSo after turn9, we can climb.\n\nBut we need to reach y=7 by turn10 for our earlier plan? No, in this new plan for freeway7 at turn10, we need to be at y=7 at turn10.\n\nIf we are at y=1 at turn9, then at turn10 we move to 2, not 7.\n\nSo we need to revise: we can be at freeway7 at a turn later than 10.\n\nFor example, be at freeway7 at turn12: safe (t=12 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\nThen freeway8 at turn13: safe.\n\nThen at turn14: move to 9.\n\nSo H=14.\n\nThen we have turns 0 to 13, and y14=9.\n\nWe can be at freeway7 at turn12, freeway8 at turn13.\n\nWe need to avoid freeway2-8 at turns 8 and 9 by being at y=0 or 1.\n\nSo at turn8 and turn9, we are at y=0 or 1.\n\nThen after turn9, we can climb.\n\nWe have from turn0 to turn7 to get to some y, then at turn7 we must be at y=2 or less to move to y=1 at turn8.\n\nFor example:\n\nTarget at turn7: y7=2 ( freeway2 at turn7: safe)\n\n turn8: move down to 1 -> safe\n turn9: move down to 0 or stay at 1 or move up to 2. Let's stay at 1 to be safe.\n\nThen from turn10 to turn12: we need to get to y=7 at turn12.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn9 to y=7 at turn12: 3 moves, need to go up 6 -> impossible.\n\nSo we must start climbing before turn9.\n\nBut at turn9, we are at y=1. Then turn10: move to 2, turn11: to 3, turn12: to 4, turn13: to 5, not 7.\n\nSo to reach y=7 at turn12, we need to be at y=4 at turn12? then move up three times? but we have only three moves from turn10 to turn12.\n\n turn10: from y9=1 to y10=2\n turn11: to 3\n turn12: to 4\n\n not 7.\n\nSo we must be higher at turn9.\n\nBut at turn9, we must be at y=0 or 1.\n\nSo we cannot be higher.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at freeway7 after turn9, but not at turn10 if we are at y=1 at turn9.\n\nWe can be at freeway7 at turn14, for example.\n\nBut then H will be larger.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal possible H.\n\nWe must spend turns 8 and 9 at y=0 or 1.\n\nThe most efficient way is to be at y=1 at turn7, then at turn8 and turn9 we can stay at 1 or move between 0 and 1.\n\nThen after turn9, we can climb as fast as possible.\n\nWe need to go from y=1 (at turn9) to y=9.\n\n That requires 8 moves up: turn10 to turn17: y10=2, y11=3, ..., y17=9.\n\n So H=18 ( actions from turn0 to turn17).\n\nThen at turn17, we are at y17=9? No: after 18 actions, we are at y18=9.\n\n turn0: 0\n turn1: 1\n ...\n turn7: 7? But then at turn7 we are at 7, and we need to be at 1 at turn7 for the safe haven? No.\n\nWe can be at y=1 at turn7 by moving down after reaching higher, but that costs turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can go slow in the beginning.\n\nSpecifically, we can go from 0 to 1 in 7 turns? That would be inefficient.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to spend as few turns as possible before turn8.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 or 1 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nThe fastest way to get to the safe haven is to go to y=1 as fast as possible and then stay there.\n\nSo:\n turn0: 0 -> move up to 1: y1=1\n turn1: stay at 1: y2=1\n ...\n until turn7: we can be at 1.\n\nBut then from turn0 to turn7, we have 8 moves ( turn0 to turn7) and we are at y=1 at turn7.\n\nThen:\n turn7: y7=1\n turn8: stay at 1 -> y8=1 (safe)\n turn9: stay at 1 -> y9=1 (safe)\n\n then turn10: move up to 2\n turn11: to 3\n turn12: to 4\n turn13: to 5\n turn14: to 6\n turn15: to 7\n turn16: to 8\n turn17: to 9\n\n So at turn18: y18=9.\n\nThis is H=18.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nCheck freeway2-6: we are on them after turn9. For example, freeway2 at turn10: t=10>9, so safe (since for freeway2-6, unsafe only at t=8,9).\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn15: t=15 not in {2,3,8,9} -> safe.\n freeway8 at turn16: t=16 not in {2,3,8,9} -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway1 during turns1-9: always safe.\n\nSo this works.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe could be at a higher freeway before turn7, but then move down to 1 by turn8.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=7 by turn7: as in the straight up path, then at turn7 we are at 7.\n\nThen we have to move down to 1 by turn8: impossible.\n\nWe can go up to y=3 by turn3: \n turn0: 0->1\n turn1: 1->2\n turn2: 2->3\n turn3: 3\n\n then we can stay at 3 for some turns, but then at turn7 we are at 3, and at turn8 we move down to 2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at t=8).\n\n move down to 3-1=2 at turn8: unsafe.\n\nSo we must move down earlier.\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 by turn4, then start moving down:\n\n turn4: y4=4\n turn5: move down to 3\n turn6: move down to 2\n turn7: move down to 1 -> safe at turn7 ( freeway1)\n\n then turn8: stay at 1\n turn9: stay at 1\n\n then turn10: start up: turn10:2, turn11:3, turn12:4, turn13:5, turn14:6, turn15:7, turn16:8, turn17:9 -> still H=18.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr we can go to y=5 by turn5, then down:\n\n turn0:0->1\n turn1:1->2\n turn2:2->3\n turn3:3->4\n turn4:4->5\n turn5:5->4\n turn6:4->3\n turn7:3->2 -> but at turn7, freeway2 is safe (t=7<8), then\n turn8: move down to 1 -> safe\n turn9: stay at 1 -> safe\n then turn10:2, ..., turn17:9 -> still 18 moves.\n\nOr at turn7: we are at 2, and we move down to 1 at turn8, same as above.\n\nCan we squeeze in more moves up before turn7? We have 7 moves from turn0 to turn6 (since at turn6 we are at y6).\n\nWe can be at y=6 at turn6: \n turn0:0->1\n turn1:1->2\n turn2:2->3\n turn3:3->4\n turn4:4->5\n turn5:5->6\n turn6:6\n\n then at turn7: move down to 5 -> unsafe? no, at turn7, freeway5 is safe because t=7<8.\n turn8: move down to 4 -> unsafe! because freeway4 at t=8 is unsafe.\n\n turn7: move down to 5 ( safe at t=7)\n turn8: move down to 4 ( unsafe at t=8)\n\n not good.\n\n move down to 6 at turn7? -> then at turn8, freeway6 at t=8: unsafe.\n\n so we must move down to below freeway2 by turn8, i.e., to y=1.\n\n from y=6 at turn7, we can only move to 5 at turn8, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the safe way is to be at y=1 at turn7 and then stay there for turns8 and 9.\n\nThen the earliest we can reach y=9 is turn18.\n\nSo minimal H is 18.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nActions from turn0 to turn17.\n\nWe want to be at y=1 by turn7 and stay there for turns8 and9, then climb.\n\nBut at turn0: we are at 0.\n\nWe can:\n\n turn0: U -> y1=1\n then we need to stay at 1 for turns1 to7? Because if we move up, we will be on higher freeways, and then we have to move down, but we want to be at 1 at turn7.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n To be at y=1 at turn7, we can:\n - At turn0: U -> y1=1\n - Then turns1 to6: we can stay at 1 (S) or move down to 0 and back, but we want to minimize turns? But we are forced to wait anyway.\n\n Since we have to be at 1 at turn7, and we are already at 1 at turn1, we can just stay.\n\nSo:\n\n turn0: U  -> y1=1\n turn1: S  -> y2=1\n turn2: S  -> y3=1\n turn3: S  -> y4=1\n turn4: S  -> y5=1\n turn5: S  -> y6=1\n turn6: S  -> y7=1\n turn7: S  -> y8=1\n turn8: S  -> y9=1  [ safe at turn8]\n turn9: S  -> y10=1 [ safe at turn9]\n turn10: U -> y11=2\n turn11: U -> y12=3\n turn12: U -> y13=4\n turn13: U -> y14=5\n turn14: U -> y15=6\n turn15: U -> y16=7\n turn16: U -> y17=8\n turn17: U -> y18=9\n\n So the actions are:\n\n Turn 0: U\n Turn 1: S\n Turn 2: S\n Turn 3: S\n Turn 4: S\n Turn 5: S\n Turn 6: S\n Turn 7: S\n Turn 8: S\n Turn 9: S\n Turn10: U\n Turn11: U\n Turn12: U\n Turn13: U\n Turn14: U\n Turn15: U\n Turn16: U\n Turn17: U\n\n But is freeway7 at turn15 safe? \n   freeway7 is unsafe at t=2,3,8,9 -> turn15 is safe.\n freeway8 at turn16: safe.\n\n freeway2-6 at turns10-14: turns10,11,12,13,14 are all >9 or <8? turn10=10>9, so safe for freeway2-6.\n\n freeway1 at turns1-9: safe.\n\n freeway0 at turn0: safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nThis is H=18.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nWe could go up faster initially and then move down to the safe haven.\n\nFor example, go to y=3 in 3 turns, then move down to 1 in 2 turns, but then we are at 1 before turn7, and we have to wait.\n\nLet's try:\n\n turn0: U -> y1=1\n turn1: U -> y2=2\n turn2: U -> y3=3\n turn3: S -> y4=3  [ freeway3 at turn3: safe (t=3<8)]\n turn4: D -> y5=2\n turn5: D -> y6=1\n turn6: S -> y7=1\n turn7: S -> y8=1\n turn8: S -> y9=1\n turn9: S -> y10=1\n turn10: U -> y11=2\n ... same as before, reach y=9 at turn18.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nWe could go to y=4:\n\n turn0: U->1\n turn1: U->2\n turn2: U->3\n turn3: U->4\n turn4: D->3\n turn5: D->2\n turn6: D->1\n turn7: S->1\n turn8: S->1\n turn9: S->1\n turn10: U->2\n ... again, at turn10 we are at 2, and we need 8 more moves to 9: turn10 to turn17: 8 moves to go up 7? from 2 to 9: 7 moves? \n turn10:2->3\n turn11:3->4\n turn12:4->5\n turn13:5->6\n turn14:6->7\n turn15:7->8\n turn16:8->9 -> so at turn17 we are at 9? But then we have 17 actions? From turn0 to turn16, we have 17 actions, and y17=9.\n\n Let's count the turns:\n\n actions at turn0 to turn16: 17 actions.\n\n positions:\n turn0: start y0=0\n turn0 action: U -> y1=1\n turn1: U -> y2=2\n turn2: U -> y3=3\n turn3: U -> y4=4\n turn4: D -> y5=3\n turn5: D -> y6=2\n turn6: D -> y7=1\n turn7: S -> y8=1\n turn8: S -> y9=1\n turn9: S -> y10=1\n turn10: U -> y11=2\n turn11: U -> y12=3\n turn12: U -> y13=4\n turn13: U -> y14=5\n turn14: U -> y15=6\n turn15: U -> y16=7\n turn16: U -> y17=8  -> not 9! We need one more.\n\n turn17: U -> y18=9\n\n So still 18 actions.\n\nWe can try to be at a higher freeway at turn10.\n\nFor example, after turn9 we are at y=1.\n\nIf we could move up faster, but we can only move one per turn.\n\n So the minimal H is 18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 18 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the freeway at each turn:\n\n turn0: y0=0 (safe)\n action0: U -> y1=1\n turn1: at y1=1 (freeway1, safe)\n action1: S -> y2=1\n turn2: y2=1 (safe)\n action2: S -> y3=1\n turn3: y3=1 (safe)\n action3: S -> y4=1\n turn4: y4=1 (safe)\n action4: S -> y5=1\n turn5: y5=1 (safe)\n action5: S -> y6=1\n turn6: y6=1 (safe)\n action6: S -> y7=1\n turn7: y7=1 (safe)\n action7: S -> y8=1\n turn8: y8=1 (safe)\n action8: S -> y9=1\n turn9: y9=1 (safe)\n action9: U -> y10=2\n turn10: y10=2 (freeway2, safe because t=10 not 8 or 9)\n action10: U -> y11=3 (freeway3, safe at t=11)\n action11: U -> y12=4 (freeway4, safe)\n action12: U -> y13=5 (freeway5, safe)\n action13: U -> y14=6 (freeway6, safe)\n action14: U -> y15=7 (freeway7, safe because t=15 not in {2,3,8,9})\n action15: U -> y16=8 (freeway8, safe at t=16)\n action16: U -> y17=9 (not on any freeway with cars, safe)\n action17: ? But we are already at y17=9, and we need to end at y18=9? \n\nWait, we have to have y_{t1+H} =9, and we have actions from t1=0 to turn17 (18 actions), and then y18=9.\n\nBut at turn17, we are at y17=8, then action17: U -> y18=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn17.\n\nAnd at turn17, we are at freeway8, which is safe (t=17 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\nThen after action17, we are at y18=9.\n\nSo the sequence has 18 actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to list actions for turn0 to turn17.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\n\nBut note that from turn1 to turn9, we are staying at 1, so we can use S.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 17 actions? We would have to reach y=9 at turn17.\n\nThat means we need to be at y=8 at turn16.\n\nBut to be at freeway8 at turn16 is safe.\n\nBut we must be at the safe haven at turns8 and9.\n\nFrom turn0 to turn7: 8 actions to get to some state, then turns8 and9 at safe haven, then turns10 to16 to climb.\n\nAt turn9, we are at y=0 or 1.\n\nFrom turn9 to turn16: 7 actions to go from y9 to y16.\n\nThe maximum we can go is from 1 to 1+7=8, so y16=8.\n\nThen we need one more action to go to 9, so at turn17: U, then y17=9.\n\nSo we need 18 actions.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut note: at turn17, we are at y17=8, and we do U to go to 9.\n\nBut the sequence has 18 actions, and we reach y18=9.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+17.\n\nSo it's 18 actions.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and here t1=0.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check if we can avoid some of the initial S's.\n\nFor example, could we go to a higher freeway and then come down, but still within the turns and without being caught at turns8 and9, and then have a shorter total time? It seems not, because the climb after turn9 takes 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we could be at y=0 at some turns to save time? For example, at turn0, we are at 0. If we stay at 0 for some turns, then we have to go to 1 later.\n\nBut it won't save turns.\n\n I think 18 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 18. This requires 18 actions from turn 0 to turn 17, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1.\n- Stay at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, which is always safe) from turns 1 to 9 to avoid collisions on freeways 2-8 during turns 8 and 9, when those freeways are unsafe.\n- After turn 9, move up consecutively from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) over the next 8 turns, ensuring that:\n  - Freeways 2-6 are only visited at turns \\(\\geq 10\\) (safe, as they are unsafe only at turns 8 and 9).\n  - Freeway 7 is visited at turn 15 (safe, as unsafe at turns 2, 3, 8, 9).\n  - Freeway 8 is visited at turn 16 (safe, as unsafe at turns 2, 3, 8, 9) and turn 17 (safe for the same reason).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U}\n}",

The freeways are y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=2 at turn t=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions and how they move. The cars are given at turn t=3, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t=3 onwards.\n\nThe player position is updated based on the action: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nFor cars, they move left or right based on their direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase. The span is given as [head, tail] for left-moving or [tail, head] for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. Similarly for right-moving, it's [τ, h] at t1 and [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] at T.\n\nBut in the collision condition, it says collision occurs if 0 is in the span for the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, but you are not considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. The note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nI think I need to parse that.\n\nIt means that at each turn T, you are present on a specific freeway y_T. If you take an action to move to a different y, that move happens, and at turn T+1, you are on the new y.\n\nBut during turn T, when you are deciding to move, you are still on y_T, and collision is checked based on y_T and the car spans at time T.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if you are on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T, then collision occurs.\n\nThe note clarifies that when you move, at the moment of moving, you are not yet on the new freeway, so you don't check collision for the new freeway until you are actually on it.\n\nSimilarly, when you leave a freeway, you are no longer on it.\n\nSo, for example, if at turn T you are on y, and you move to y+1, then at turn T, you are on y, so collision is checked for freeway y at time T. At turn T+1, you are on y+1, so collision is checked for freeway y+1 at time T+1.\n\nYou are never on two freeways at once.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at t1=3, and I need to compute their positions at future times relative to t1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1, so at time T, for a car, the span changes based on s and direction.\n\nSince all cars are moving, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is covering x=0 at that time.\n\nx=0 is the player's x-position; the player is always at x=0, I think, since it's (0, y_t), so we only care about when cars have span containing 0.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player is fixed at x=0, moving vertically, while cars move horizontally on the freeways.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to know when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, at each turn, when I'm on a freeway y, I need that for that y, at that time, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars per freeway at t1=3.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span is [τ, h]? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor right-moving, it says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nSo head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince direction is right, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt] where Δt = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (-30, -41, right, 6) so [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at t1, then at T: [-41 + 6Δt, -30 + 6Δt]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-30, -41, right, 6) so same as above.\n\nFreeway 4: same (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nAll freeways 2 to 6 have identical cars: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (-30, -41, right, 6), (6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6)\n\n(6, -5, right, 6)? Head 6, tail -5, but for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [-5, 6]? But it says (head, tail), so head is the front, I assume.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, head is larger if moving right, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1, head=-36, tail=-47, so head > tail since -36 > -47, so for right-moving, head is the front, so span from tail to head, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly here, for (6, -5, right, 6), head=6, tail=-5, so τ=-5, h=6, so span at t1: [-5, 6]\n\nSimilarly, (42, 31, right, 6), head=42, tail=31, so [31,42]\n\nAnd first one (-30,-41,right,6) same as before, [-41,-30]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7: (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (42,31,right,6)\n\nNow, freeway 1 has only one car, freeways 2-6 have one car each, but same as the first car on 7 and 8.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5,6 each have one car: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars, freeway 8 has three cars.\n\nI need to go from y=2 to y=9. y=9 is the top, I think, since y=0 to 9, and 9 is the goal.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=2.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is above the freeways.\n\nSo I need to move up from y=2 to y=9.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nMinimal number of moves: since I need to go from y=2 to y=9, that's 7 steps up, so at least 7 turns if I go straight up.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but since time is minimal, probably go straight up unless blocked.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nAlso, since cars move, the times when x=0 is covered change.\n\nMoreover, multiple cars per freeway might cover x=0 at different times.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to find the times when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, the set of times T when for some car, 0 ∈ Span(T).\n\nSince the player is at x=0.\n\nNow, time is discrete, turns, so T is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt1=3, so T=3,4,5,... \n\nNow, for each freeway, find for which T, there is a collision risk, meaning 0 is covered at time T.\n\nThen, when I am on that freeway at time T, I must avoid that time.\n\nBut since I move, I can choose when to be on which freeway.\n\nI start at y=2 at time t=3.\n\nFreeway y=2 is one of the freeways with a car.\n\nList freeways:\n\ny=1: one car: span at T: [-47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt] with Δt = T-3\n\nSet 0 in this interval: -47 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12Δt\n\nSo -47 +12Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -36 +12Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -47 +12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt ≤ 3 since integer? Δt integer? T integer, t1=3, so Δt = T-3 integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -36 +12Δt => 12Δt ≥ 36 => Δt ≥ 3.\n\nSo for Δt=3, both: -47+36 = -11 ≤0, and -36+36=0≤0, so 0 ≤0 is true, so at Δt=3, 0 is in [-11, 0], since -47+12*3 = -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for other Δt.\n\nFrom above: Δt ≥ 3 and Δt ≤ 3.916, so since Δt integer, Δt=3 only.\n\nΔt ≥3 and Δt ≤ 47/12=3.916, so Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, T=6, span is [-11,0], contains 0.\n\nNow, for Δt=4: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so no.\n\nΔt=2: -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, so only at T=6 for freeway 1.\n\nT= t1 + Δt =3 + Δt, so at T=6, freeway 1 has a car covering x=0.\n\nNow, freeway 2: car (-30,-41,right,6), span at t1: [-41,-30]? τ=-41, h=-30, so [ -41, -30 ] at t1.\n\nAt T: [ -41 +6Δt, -30 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in this: -41+6Δt ≤0 ≤ -30+6Δt\n\nFirst: -41+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤41 => Δt ≤41/6≈6.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30+6Δt => 6Δt ≥30 => Δt ≥5\n\nSo Δt ≥5 and Δt ≤6.833, so Δt=5,6\n\nFor Δt=5: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, span [-11,0], contains 0\n\nΔt=6: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, span [-5,6], contains 0\n\nΔt=7: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], no 0\n\nΔt=4: -41+24= -17, -30+24= -6, [-17,-6], no 0\n\nSo for freeway 2, at T=3+5=8 and T=3+6=9, collision if on y=2 at those times.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car, so also at T=8 and T=9, risk.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 all same, so for each, at T=8 and T=9, if on that freeway, collision.\n\nBut since different freeways, it depends when I am on them.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (-30,-41,right,6), so same, will cover at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), head=6, tail=-5, so at t1, span [τ,h] = [-5,6]\n\nAt T: [ -5 +6Δt, 6 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in this: -5+6Δt ≤0 ≤6+6Δt\n\nFirst: -5+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤5 => Δt ≤ 5/6 ≈0.833, so Δt ≤0 since integer? Δt integer, so Δt ≤0, but Δt = T-3 ≥0, so only possible if Δt=0, but let's see.\n\n-5+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤5, Δt ≤ 5/6 <1, so for Δt=0, -5+0= -5 ≤0, and 6+0=6≥0, so 0 in [-5,6] at t1? Δt=0, T=t1=3.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤6 +6Δt, always true since 6Δt≥0.\n\nBut first: -5+6Δt ≤0, for Δt=0, -5≤0 true, so at T=3, 0 in span.\n\nFor Δt=1: -5+6=1, 6+6=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=0: T=3, span [-5,6], contains 0.\n\nΔt=1: [1,12], no.\n\nAlso, for Δt negative? No, T≥t1.\n\nSo only at T=3 for this car.\n\nBut at T=3, we are at turn t1=3, but we start at that time, and we are on y=2, not on y=7.\n\nFor freeway 7, we are not on it at t=3.\n\nThe car is on freeway 7, but at t=3, if someone were on y=7, it would collide, but we are not.\n\nFor this car, only at T=3, 0 is covered.\n\nNow third car on freeway 7: (42,31,right,6), head=42, tail=31, so span at t1: [31,42]\n\nAt T: [31 +6Δt, 42 +6Δt]\n\nSince min 31>0, and increasing, 0 never in span, so no risk.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars.\n\nFreeway 8 has the same three cars as freeway 7.\n\nNow, for freeway 7:\n\n- First car: like others, covers 0 at T=8 and T=9\n\n- Second car: covers 0 only at T=3\n\n- Third car: no cover\n\nSo overall for freeway 7, 0 covered at T=3 (from second car), and at T=8,9 (from first car).\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same.\n\nNow, freeway 1: only at T=6\n\nFreeways 2-6: each at T=8 and T=9\n\nBut since we are on one freeway at a time, we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nNow, we start at t=3, y=2.\n\nFreeway y=2 is one of 2-6, so at t=3, on y=2.\n\nIs it dangerous at t=3?\n\nFor y=2, which is freeway 2, at t=3, Δt=0, span [-41,-30], which is all negative, 0 not in, so safe. Similarly for all, at t=3, only freeway 7 has a car at 0, but we are not on it.\n\nSo at t=3, we are safe on y=2.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, which might be above, so we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), and we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1? The sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and after H actions, at time t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nLet's see the player update:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nAction at time t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after action at t1+H-1, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at y_{t1} = y_3 =2, we need to increase by 7, so at least 7 Up actions.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so if all U, we reach in 7 turns: from t=3 to t=9, y=2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=10? Let's see:\n\nAt time t, before action, we are at y_t.\n\nAction at t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at time t=3, position y=2.\n\nAction a_3 at time 3: if U, then y_4 = 3\n\na_4 at time 4: if U, y_5=4, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at time t=3+k, position y_{3+k}.\n\nWe want y_{3+H} =9, with H actions from t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, time is t=3+H, position y_{3+H}.\n\nSet y_{3+H} =9.\n\nSince y_3=2, we need net +7 in y, so number of U minus number of D must be 7, and number of S adds nothing.\n\nMinimal H is 7, with all U.\n\nBut we might have to wait or detour if there are collisions.\n\nNow, with cars, we need to ensure that at each time T, when we are on y_T, it is safe, meaning no car on that freeway has 0 in span at time T.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, the dangerous times.\n\nFreeway y=1: dangerous only at T=6\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=8,9\n\ny=3: same as y=2, dangerous at T=8,9\n\ny=4: same, T=8,9\n\ny=5: same, T=8,9\n\ny=6: same, T=8,9\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=3 (from second car), and T=8,9 (from first car)\n\nT=3 is past, but at T=3, we were not on y=7.\n\nDangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=8: same as y=7, dangerous at T=3,8,9\n\nBut T=3 is over, so only T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so always safe, but we start at y=2, not on y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are mostly at T=8 and T=9 for freeways 1 to 8, but y=1 only at T=6, which is earlier.\n\nWe start at t=3, y=2.\n\nIf we go straight up:\n\nAt t=3, on y=2, safe as we saw.\n\nAction a3=U, then at t=4, y=3, on freeway 3.\n\nAt t=4, for y=3, which is like y=2, dangerous only at T=8,9, t=4<8, so safe? At t=4, Δt=1, for car on y=3: span [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a4=U, t=5, y=4, on freeway 4, span at Δt=2: [-41+12, -30+12]= [-29,-18], safe.\n\na5=U, t=6, y=5, on freeway 5.\n\nAt t=6, for freeway 5, car span: Δt=3, [-41+18, -30+18]= [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut freeway y=1 is dangerous at t=6, but we are not on y=1.\n\nNow, a6=U, t=7, y=6, on freeway 6.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, span [-41+24, -30+24]= [-17,-6], safe.\n\na7=U, t=8, y=7, on freeway 7.\n\nNow at t=8, freeway 7 is dangerous, because T=8 is a dangerous time for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for all freeways 2-8, dangerous at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, if on any of y=2 to y=8, it is dangerous, because for y=2-6, dangerous at T=8,9; y=7 and 8 also dangerous at T=8,9.\n\ny=1 dangerous only at T=6, not 8.\n\nBut at t=8, if we are on y=7, it is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue, a8=U, t=9, y=8, on freeway 8, dangerous at t=9.\n\nThen a9=U, t=10, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we would be on freeways and collide.\n\nSo straight up doesn't work because at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=7 and y=8 when they are dangerous.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut t=8 and t=9 are critical times.\n\nSince we start at t=3, we can go slower or faster or detour.\n\nMinimal H is 7, but with collisions at t=8 and t=9.\n\nH=7 actions: from t=3 to t=9, actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9, then at t=10, y=10? Let's clarify.\n\nStart: t=3, y=2\n\nAfter action at t=3: y=3 at t=4\n\nAfter action at t=4: y=4 at t=5\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=k: y_{k+1} at time k+1.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = y_{3+H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, time is 3+H, position y_{3+H}.\n\nSet y_{3+H} =9.\n\nWith all U, y_{3+H} = 2 + H, since each U increases by 1.\n\nSet 2 + H =9, so H=7.\n\nThen at time t=10, y=9.\n\nBut during the path:\n\nAt time t=4, y=3 (after first U)\n\nt=5, y=4\n\nt=6, y=5\n\nt=7, y=6\n\nt=8, y=7\n\nt=9, y=8\n\nt=10, y=9\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=7, which is dangerous.\n\nAt t=9, on y=8, dangerous.\n\nWe need to not be on freeways at t=8 and t=9.\n\nOne way is to delay our movement so that we are not on the critical freeways at critical times.\n\nSince the critical times are t=8 and t=9, we can be on y=0 or y=9 at those times, which are safe.\n\ny=0 or y=9 have no cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but we might reach it earlier or later.\n\nWe start from y=2.\n\nWe can go down to y=0 and wait, or go up but slower.\n\nSince we need to go up, going down might cost extra time.\n\nList the dangerous periods.\n\nFor freeways 2-8, dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous at t=6 only.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, which we might not need to use.\n\nWe need to plan a path from t=3 to some t where we reach y=9, avoiding being on freeway y when y has 0 covered at that time.\n\nSince the dangerous times are t=8,9 for y=2 to 8, we should be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so if we can reach y=9 before t=8, or after t=9, but after t=9 might be late.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only go up one per turn, so we need at least 7 turns from y=2.\n\nAt t=3, y=2.\n\nIf we go all U, we reach y=9 at t=10, as above.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe can, for example, at some point, go down to y=0 and wait, then go up.\n\nBut that might add turns.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, we can go to y=0 and stay there during critical times.\n\nBut y=0 might not be directly accessible from all points, but we can go down.\n\nStart at t=3, y=2.\n\nSuppose we go down first to y=0.\n\nAction at t=3: D, then y_4 = 2 -1 =1\n\nBut y=1 is a freeway, at t=4, we are on y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 dangerous only at t=6, not at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, for y=1, car span: Δt=1, [-47+12, -36+12]= [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at t=4: D, y_5 =1-1=0, at time t=5.\n\nAt t=5, on y=0, safe, no freeway.\n\nThen we can stay on y=0 for some turns.\n\nAction at t=5: S, y_6=0\n\nt=6: S, y_7=0\n\nt=7: S, y_8=0\n\nt=8: S, y_9=0\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=9: S, y_10=0\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nThen from here, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=0, to y=9, need 9 Up actions.\n\nBut we are at y=0 at t=5, after some actions.\n\nLet's list the sequence so far:\n\nt=3: action D, y4=1 (at time t=4)\n\nt=4: action D, y5=0 (t=5)\n\nt=5: S, y6=0\n\nt=6: S, y7=0\n\nt=7: S, y8=0\n\nt=8: S, y9=0\n\nt=9: ? we can start going up.\n\nBut at t=9, we are at y=0, action at t=9: U, y10=1\n\nBut at t=10, on y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 dangerous only at t=6, which is past, so at t=10, should be safe.\n\nAt t=10, Δt=7, span for y=1 car: [-47+84, -36+84]= [37,48], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen action U, y11=2\n\nt=11, on y=2, dangerous at t=8,9, but t=11>9, so safe. Span at Δt=8: [-41+48, -30+48]= [7,18], no 0.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up all the way.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nWe reached y=0 at t=5, then stayed until t=9, that's 4 turns at y=0, then from y=0 to y=9, 9 actions, so from start, actions from t=3 to t=3 + H -1, and y at t=3+H.\n\nCurrently: actions at t=3 (D), t=4 (D), t=5 (S), t=6 (S), t=7 (S), t=8 (S), t=9 (U), t=10 (U), ..., up to y=9.\n\nAfter t=9 U, y10=1\n\nt=10 U, y11=2\n\nt=11 U, y12=3\n\n...\nUp to y=9.\n\ny10=1, y11=2, y12=3, ..., need to go to y=9, which is 8 more U from y=1? From y=1 to y=9, need 8 U.\n\ny at time t: after action at t, y_{t+1}\n\nAfter action at t=9: y10=1\n\nAction at t=10: U, y11=2\n\nt=11: U, y12=3\n\n...\nt=16: U, y17=8\n\nt=17: U, y18=9\n\nSo at t=18, y=9, with H=15 actions? Let's count actions.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=17, that's 15 actions (t=3 to 17 inclusive is 15? t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: 15 actions.\n\nBut H is number of actions, and y_{3+H} = y_{18} =9.\n\nBut this is inefficient.\n\nWe can reach y=9 faster by not staying so long at y=0.\n\nThe critical times are only t=8 and t=9, so we need to be not on freeways only at those times.\n\nWe can be on y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so if we can reach y=9 before t=8, or at t=8 or t=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 before t=8, we need to be at y=9 at some t<=8.\n\nAt t=3, y=2.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9: if all U, at t=10, as before, which is after t=9.\n\nCan we reach earlier? No, because from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so minimum at t=10 if start from t=3.\n\nt=3: start, after 0 actions, y=2 at t=3\n\nAfter 1 U: t=4, y=3\n\nAfter 2 U: t=5, y=4\n\nAfter 3 U: t=6, y=5\n\nAfter 4 U: t=7, y=6\n\nAfter 5 U: t=8, y=7\n\nAfter 6 U: t=9, y=8\n\nAfter 7 U: t=10, y=9\n\nSo we cannot reach before t=10; earliest at t=10.\n\nAt t=8, we are at y=7, not y=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=8.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 at t=8 or t=9 with minimal path.\n\nTherefore, for t=8 and t=9, we must be on y=0 to avoid freeways.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from start, we need to reach y=0 by t=8.\n\nAt t=3, y=2.\n\nTo reach y=0, we need to go down.\n\nEach D decreases y by 1.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=0, need 2 Down actions.\n\nWe can do it quickly.\n\nFor example, at t=3: D, then y4=1\n\nt=4: D, y5=0\n\nNow at t=5, y=0.\n\nThen we can stay at y=0 until t=8 or t=9.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=5, we are at y=0.\n\nThen actions:\n\nt=5: S, y6=0 (t=6)\n\nt=6: S, y7=0 (t=7)\n\nt=7: S, y8=0 (t=8)\n\nt=8: S, y9=0 (t=9)\n\nNow at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, go up to y=9.\n\nt=8: action at t=8, we did S, y9=0\n\nt=9: now action, say U, y10=1\n\nBut at t=10, on y=1, which is safe as before.\n\nThen U to y=9.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier, but during critical times we need to be at y=0.\n\nt=9 is critical, so at t=9, we need to be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable yet, so y=0.\n\nSimilarly for t=8.\n\nIn the above, at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=0.\n\nAfter t=9, we go up.\n\nBut from t=5 to t=8, we are staying at y=0, which is not necessary; we could go up earlier, but we have to avoid being on freeways at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSince we are at y=0 at t=5, we can go up slowly, but we need to be back to y=0 at t=8 and t=9? No, at time t=8, we need to be on y=0, so position at time t=8 is y=0.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y=0.\n\nPosition at time T is y_T.\n\nAt time T, we are on y_T.\n\nFor T=8 and T=9, we need y_8 =0 and y_9=0.\n\ny_9=0 means at time t=9, position y=0.\n\nThen from there, we go to y=9.\n\nNow, from start: at t=3, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=0 by t=8, but since we can go down fast, and stay.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should go down and stay only as needed, then go up.\n\nBut to reach y=0, we can do it in 2 downs, as above.\n\nThen we need y_8=0 and y_9=0, so at least from t=8 to t=9, we stay or something.\n\ny_8=0 and y_9=0, so at time t=8, position 0, and at t=9, position 0, so we must be at y=0 at both times, so action at t=8 must be S or something, but let's see.\n\nFrom y_8 to y_9, by action at t=8.\n\nIf y_8=0, then action at t=8: if S, y_9=0; if U, y_9=1; etc.\n\nTo have y_9=0, if y_8=0, then action at t=8 must be S.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_8=0.\n\nNow, we can reach y_8=0.\n\nFor example, from t=3:\n\nAction at t=3: U or D or S.\n\nIf we go down: t=3: D, y4=1\n\nt=4: D, y5=0\n\nNow at t=5, y=0.\n\nThen to have y_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\ny_5=0.\n\nAction at t=5: if S, y6=0\n\nt=6: S, y7=0\n\nt=7: S, y8=0\n\nt=8: S, y9=0\n\nThen t=9: now we can go up, but y9=0 at time t=9, so action at t=9: U, then y10=1\n\nThen continue U to y=9.\n\nBut at t=10, y=1, safe.\n\nt=11, y=2, safe, etc.\n\nBut this takes time.\n\nWe can go up between t=5 and t=8, but we need to be back at y=0 at t=8.\n\nFor example, from y_5=0, we can go up to some y, then down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut that might not save time and could risk collisions.\n\nSince only t=8 and t=9 are critical for freeways, and other times are safe except for specific freeways at specific times, but in this case, only y=1 at t=6 is dangerous, but we might not be on it.\n\nIn the above path, when we go up after t=9, we are on freeways at later times, but since no danger after t=9 for these freeways, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, freeways 2-6 dangerous only at t=8,9, so after that, safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 dangerous at t=8,9, and also at t=3, but t=3 past.\n\nSo after t=9, all freeways are safe to be on.\n\nIn the going up phase, no problem.\n\nBut the delay is at y=0.\n\nTo minimize H, we should minimize the time at y=0 or moving down.\n\nSince we need to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9, we can arrive at y=0 exactly at t=8.\n\nFor example, start by going up slowly or something, but we need to reach y=0 at t=8.\n\nAt t=3, y=2.\n\nWe need to set y_8=0.\n\nFrom y_3=2 to y_8=0, net change -2 in 5 turns (from t=3 to t=8, 5 actions: t=3,4,5,6,7 determine y_8).\n\ny_{t+1} after action at t.\n\ny_8 is determined by action at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 by action at t=8.\n\nTo have y_8=0, and y_9=0.\n\nNow, from y_3=2 to y_8=0, net decrease of 2, so we can have, for example, two D and three S, or one D and some U and D, but net -2.\n\nSimilarly, for y_9=0, from y_8=0, action at t=8 must be S.\n\nThen from t=9, we go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's first get to y_8=0.\n\nMinimal actions to go from y=2 to y=0 in 5 turns? But we can do it faster, but we have time until t=8.\n\nTo save time, we might go up first to higher y, but since we need to be at y=0 at t=8, going up would mean we have to come down, which might cost more actions.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=4 or something, then down to y=0 at t=8, but that could take more than 2 downs.\n\nNet effect: from t=3 to t=7 (actions at t=3,4,5,6,7) to set y_8.\n\ny_8 = y_3 + sum of Δy from actions at t=3 to t=7.\n\ny_8 = 2 + Σ_{t=3 to7} Δy_t\n\nSet equal to 0, so Σ Δy_t = -2.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0, or +1.\n\nMinimal number of actions to decrease by 2 is 2, but we have 5 actions, so we can have two D and three S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, we can have other combinations.\n\nBut with S, we are staying on some freeway, which might be dangerous if at wrong time.\n\nBut in this period, t=4 to t=8, the only dangerous time is for y=1 at t=6.\n\nOtherwise, for other freeways, dangerous only at t=8,9, but t=8 is the time we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nt=6 is dangerous for y=1.\n\nSo if we are on y=1 at t=6, it is dangerous.\n\nIn the sequence to reach y_8=0, we need to avoid being on y=1 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, no danger except t=6 for y=1.\n\nt=4,5,7, etc., for the freeways, are safe except as above.\n\nFor example, at t=4, all freeways safe except possibly, but from earlier, only y=7 had danger at t=3, but not at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, t=5, all safe.\n\nt=6: y=1 dangerous.\n\nt=7: for freeways, at t=7, which is before t=8,9, so for y=2-6, span at Δt=4, [-17,-6] for example, safe; y=7 at Δt=4, for first car [-41+24, -30+24]= [-17,-6] for the similar car, but y=7 has multiple cars, at t=7, Δt=4, first car span [-41+24, -30+24]= [-17,-6], no 0; second car span [-5+24,6+24]= [19,30], no 0; third [31+24,42+24]= [55,66], no. So safe at t=7 for all.\n\nSimilarly t=4,5 safe.\n\nOnly t=6 has danger for y=1.\n\nSo in the path to reach y_8=0, we need to not be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, back to minimizing H.\n\nAfter reaching y=9, but we need to go to y=9 from y_9=0.\n\ny_9=0 at t=9.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, need 9 Up actions.\n\nAction at t=9: U, y10=1\n\nt=10: U, y11=2\n\n...\n\nt=17: U, y18=9\n\nSo y18=9, with actions from t=3 to t=17, 15 actions.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince we need to be at y=0 only at t=8 and t=9, we can be at higher y before and after, as long as at t=8 and t=9 we are at y=0.\n\nFor example, from t=3 to t=7, we can be at some y, then go down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut y_8=0, so at t=8, we are at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, y_9=0.\n\nThen from t=9, we go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we can start from higher initial y.\n\nAt t=3, y=2.\n\nWe can go up to, say, y=6 or something by t=7, then down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut going down costs actions.\n\nLet's think of the net.\n\nWe need y_{3+H} =9.\n\nThe time to reach y=9 is fixed if we go directly, but with detour.\n\nThe critical point is that at t=8 and t=9, we must have y_t =0.\n\nSo y_8 =0 and y_9=0.\n\nThen for other times, we can move freely, as long as no collision.\n\nThen from y_9=0, we need to reach y=9 as fast as possible, which takes 9 turns: from t=9 to t=18 for y=9.\n\nBut y_9=0 at t=9, action at t=9: U, y10=1; ... action at t=17: U, y18=9.\n\nSo 9 actions from t=9 to t=17, but actions start from t=9.\n\nTotal actions from t=3 to t=17 for 15 actions.\n\nBut we can have y_9=0 with fewer actions from start.\n\nFor example, if we can have y_3 higher, but it is 2.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=8, we have 5 actions (t=3 to7) to set y_8=0 from y_3=2.\n\nNet change -2, so at least 2 D actions, and 3 other actions which can be S or U or D, but net -2.\n\nIf we use U, we increase y, then need more D to come down, so it might not help; it could increase the number of actions if we go up and down.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=3: U, y4=3\n\nt=4: U, y5=4\n\nt=5: U, y6=5\n\nBut at t=6, on y=5, safe, but we need to go down to y=0 at t=8.\n\ny_8=0.\n\nFrom y6=5 at t=6, to y8=0.\n\ny8 determined by action at t=7.\n\nAfter action at t=6, y7 at t=7.\n\nThen action at t=7 determines y8.\n\nSo from y6=5, we need y8=0.\n\nIn two actions: at t=6 and t=7.\n\nPossible: t=6: D, y7=4\n\nt=7: D, y8=3? Not 0.\n\ny7=4 at t=7, then action at t=7: D, y8=3; or S, y8=4; U, y8=5, all not 0.\n\nTo reach y8=0 from y6=5 in two actions, impossible because each action changes by at most 1, so y8 >= y6 -2 =3, or <= y6+2=7, cannot reach 0 from 5 in two steps.\n\ny6 at t=6, after action at t=6, y7 at t=7.\n\nThen action at t=7, y8 at t=8.\n\nSo from y6 to y8, with two actions (at t=6 and t=7), the change is at most ±2, so y8 between y6-2 and y6+2.\n\nIf y6=5, y8 between 3 and 7, cannot be 0.\n\nSo to have y8=0, we must have y6 <=2, for example.\n\nSimilarly, from y3=2, we need to decrease to y8=0.\n\nThe fastest way is to go down directly, as before.\n\nWith 5 actions, we can have two D and three S, for example.\n\nThen from y8=0, action at t=8: S, y9=0\n\nThen from t=9, go up to y=9 in 9 actions.\n\nTotal actions: from t=3 to t=17, 15 actions.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 faster if we don't start from y=0.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, and we can be on y=9 at t=8 or t=9, but we cannot reach y=9 before t=10, as established.\n\nSo the only safe positions at t=8 and t=9 are y=0 or y=9, but y=9 not possible, so only y=0.\n\nWe must be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen the minimal H is fixed by the time to go from y=2 to y=0 and then to y=9, with waiting at y=0 during critical times.\n\nBut we don't need to wait long; we can be at y=0 only at t=8 and t=9, and move before and after.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we can be at y=1, then action D to y8=0.\n\nBut at t=7, on y=1.\n\nt=7, is y=1 dangerous? y=1 dangerous only at t=6, not t=7, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's list a sequence with minimal H.\n\nWe need y_8=0 and y_9=0.\n\nThen y_{3+H} =9.\n\nThe time from t=9 to when we reach y=9.\n\nFrom y_9=0 to y=9, 9 steps, so at t=18, y=9.\n\nH such that 3+H=18, so H=15.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=17.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we are not at y=0 at t=9, but we have to be.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at t=9, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so we can be on it at any time, no collision.\n\nBut to reach it, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIf we can be at y=9 at t=10, but at t=8 and t=9 we are on freeways if we go straight, but dangerous.\n\nIf we can be at y=9 at t=8 or t=9, impossible.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=0 at t=8 and t=9, then proceed to y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are other safe positions.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but are there freeways that are safe at t=8 and t=9?\n\nFor example, at t=8, is there any freeway not dangerous?\n\nFrom above, all freeways y=1 to 8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=1 at t=6, not at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, for y=1: Δt=5, span [-47+60, -36+60]= [13,24], no 0, so safe! I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet's double-check the dangerous times.\n\nFor freeway y=1: car at t1=3, span at T: [-47 +12(T-3), -36 +12(T-3)]\n\n0 in span when -47 +12Δt ≤0 ≤ -36 +12Δt with Δt=T-3\n\nAs before, Δt >=3 and Δt <=3.916, so only Δt=3, T=6.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=5, -47+60=13, -36+60=24, [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, Δt=6, -47+72=25, -36+72=36, [25,36], no 0, safe.\n\nFor freeway y=2: car span at T: [-41 +6(T-3), -30 +6(T-3)]\n\n0 in when -41+6Δt <=0 <= -30+6Δt\n\n6Δt >=30, Δt>=5; 6Δt <=41, Δt<=6.833, so Δt=5,6; T=8,9.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=5, -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, [-11,0], contains 0.\n\nT=9, Δt=6, -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, [-5,6], contains 0.\n\nT=7, Δt=4, -41+24= -17, -30+24= -6, [-17,-6], no 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4,5,6, all same as y=2, dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFor y=7: cars:\n\nFirst car: same as above, dangerous at T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), at T: [ -5 +6Δt, 6 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in when -5+6Δt <=0 <=6+6Δt\n\n-5+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=5, Δt<=5/6<1, so only possible Δt=0, T=3.\n\nAt T=3, covered, but later not.\n\nThird car: no cover.\n\nSo for y=7, dangerous at T=3 and T=8,9 from first car.\n\nAt T=8,9, dangerous from first car.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, freeways y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are all dangerous because each has a car covering 0 at that time.\n\ny=1 is safe at T=8 and T=9, as above.\n\ny=1 at T=8: safe, as [13,24]\n\nT=9: [25,36], safe.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, we can be on y=1, which is safe, or y=0 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable.\n\nSo we can be on y=1 at t=8 and t=9 to avoid collision.\n\nThat's better!\n\nI missed that y=1 is not dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nOnly at t=6.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, freeways y=2 to 8 are dangerous, but y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo we can be on y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen we don't need to go to y=0.\n\nWe can go directly to y=1 and stay there during critical times.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=1 at t=8.\n\ny_8=1.\n\nSimilarly, y_9=1.\n\nThen from y_9=1, go to y=9 in 8 steps.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, set y_8=1 and y_9=1.\n\nSince y_9=1, and we want to stay, action at t=8 must be S if y_8=1.\n\nNow, from y_3=2 to y_8=1, net change -1 in 5 actions (t=3 to7).\n\nNet Δy = -1.\n\nSo we can have one D and four S, for example.\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nThen from y_9=1, to y=9, need 8 U actions.\n\nBut let's find a sequence.\n\nStart at t=3, y=2.\n\nWe need y_8=1.\n\nFor example, we can go down to y=1 at some point.\n\nBut to avoid being on y=1 at t=6, when it is dangerous.\n\ny=1 dangerous at t=6.\n\nSo we must not be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nIn the path to y_8=1, we need to ensure that at t=6, we are not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, other times no problem.\n\nNow, y_8=1.\n\ny_8 = 2 + Σ_{t=3 to7} Δy_t =1, so Σ Δy_t = -1.\n\nWith 5 actions, we can have one D and four S.\n\nThe D can be at different times.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=1 at t=6.\n\nPosition at t=6: y_6.\n\nIf y_6=1, then at t=6, on y=1, dangerous.\n\nSo we must have y_6 ≠1.\n\nSince y_8=1, and y_6 to y_8 with two actions (at t=6 and t=7), y_8 between y_6-2 and y_6+2.\n\nSince y_8=1, y_6 between -1 and 3, but y in 0-9, so y_6 between 0 and 3.\n\nIf y_6=1, not allowed, so y_6 =0,2, or3.\n\nThen from there, to y_8=1.\n\nSimilarly, y_6 depends on previous.\n\nBut let's list possible.\n\nFor example, suppose we do mostly S, but with one D.\n\nCase 1: at some point do D to decrease.\n\nBut to have y_6 ≠1.\n\nFor instance, at t=3: S, y4=2 (since action S, y_{t+1}=y_t)\n\nAction at t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=3, action: if S, y4=2; if U, y4=3; if D, y4=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose at t=3: S, y4=2\n\nt=4: S, y5=2\n\nt=5: S, y6=2\n\nNow at t=6, y=2, not 1, safe.\n\nThen need y_8=1.\n\ny6=2 at t=6.\n\nThen action at t=6: to go to y7.\n\nIf D, y7=1\n\nThen action at t=7: to have y8=1, if y7=1, then S, y8=1; if U, y8=2 not 1; etc.\n\nSo if y7=1, then S to y8=1.\n\nIf we do D at t=6, y7=1, then at t=7, S, y8=1.\n\nBut at t=7, on y=1, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen action at t=7: S, y8=1.\n\nNow, for y_9: at t=8, we need to be on y=1, so action at t=8 should be S, so y9=1.\n\nThen from t=9, go up.\n\nSequence so far:\n\nt=3: S, y4=2\n\nt=4: S, y5=2\n\nt=5: S, y6=2\n\nt=6: D, y7=1  (action D at t=6, to y7=1)\n\nBut at t=6, we are on y=2, action D, so y7=1 at t=7.\n\nAt time t=6, position y=2, safe.\n\nThen action D, so at t=7, y=1.\n\nt=7: now action, to have y8=1, so S, y8=1\n\nThen t=8: action S, y9=1\n\nNow at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen from t=9, action U, y10=2\n\nt=10: U, y11=3\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9.\n\ny10=2, y11=3, ..., need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, 8 steps.\n\nAfter action at t=9: y10=1? No.\n\nAt t=9, position y=1 (since y9=1)\n\nAction at t=9: U, then y10=2\n\nAction at t=10: U, y11=3\n\n...\n\nAction at t=16: U, y17=8\n\nAction at t=17: U, y18=9\n\nSo at t=18, y=9, with H=16 actions? Actions from t=3 to t=17, that's 15 actions? t=3 to t=17 inclusive: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: 15 actions.\n\ny_{3+15} = y_{18} =9.\n\nBut earlier with y=0, also 15.\n\nBut we can reduce by not staying so long.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=3 to t=5, we stayed at y=2, but we could have moved up.\n\nSince we need to go up eventually, we can go up early to higher y, then come down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut coming down might cost extra actions.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=4 by t=6 or something.\n\nAt t=3: U, y4=3\n\nt=4: U, y5=4\n\nt=5: U, y6=5\n\nAt t=6, on y=5, safe.\n\nNow need y_8=1.\n\nFrom y6=5 to y8=1 in two actions: impossible, as y8 between 3 and 7.\n\nCannot reach 1.\n\nIf we start going down earlier.\n\nt=3: U, y4=3\n\nt=4: U, y5=4\n\nt=5: D, y6=3\n\nt=6: D, y7=2\n\nt=7: D, y8=1\n\nThen y8=1.\n\nAt t=6, on y=3, safe.\n\nt=7, on y=2, safe? At t=7, y=2, span for car: Δt=4, [-41+24, -30+24]= [-17,-6], no 0, safe.\n\nThen action at t=7: D, y8=1\n\nThen t=8: S, y9=1\n\nThen from t=9: U, y10=2, etc to y=9 at t=18.\n\nSame as before, 15 actions.\n\nWith y=1 at critical times, we save the down to y=0, but we still have the up from y=1.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we need to be at a higher y when we start the final ascent.\n\nBut since we have to be at y=1 at t=9, we start from y=1 at t=9.\n\nThe minimal H is when we reach y=9 as soon as possible after t=9.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=9, it takes 8 actions to y=9 at t=17, y18=9.\n\nt=17 action U, y18=9.\n\nSo y at t=18.\n\nIf we can be at higher y at t=9, but we have to be at y=1 at t=9, so cannot.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 at t=9, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest we can reach y=9 is t=18 with this.\n\nBut is there a way to reach before?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we don't need to stay at y=1 for both t=8 and t=9; we can be at y=1 only for the critical times, but since we need to be there at both, we stay.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be at y=1 and then move, but y=1 at t=9 is required to be safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 15 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nActions: from t=3 to t=17 for 15 actions, y18=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, and we need to output the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can have fewer actions by going directly after.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 at t=10, but with avoiding the collision.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=0 or y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, if we are at y=1, safe.\n\nAt t=9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, we are at y=1, and we can go up from there.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=10 is impossible because from y=1 to y=9 in one step? No, each step changes by 1.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, after one U, y10=2, etc.\n\nSo minimum t=18 for y=9.\n\nBut let's list a sequence with minimal turns.\n\nSince the only constraint is at t=8 and t=9, we can be on y=1 at those times, and for other times, we can be on any freeway as long as not at danger times, but the only danger time is t=6 for y=1, which we can avoid.\n\nSo for example, we can go up directly except at t=8 and t=9 we are on y=1.\n\nBut we need to be on y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo from the straight up path, at t=8 we are at y=7, but we need to be at y=1.\n\nSo we have to go down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nBut it takes time to go down.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we are at y=6 if we went up straight to that point.\n\nIn straight up: at t=7, y=6 (position at time t=7)\n\nThen to be at y=1 at t=8, we need to go down 5 steps in one action? Impossible.\n\nAction at t=7 determines y8.\n\nIf at t=7, y=6, then action at t=7 can make y8=5,6, or7, not 1.\n\nSo we need to be at lower y earlier.\n\nTo have y8=1, we must have y7 close to 1.\n\nFor example, y7=2, then D to y8=1; or y7=1, S to y8=1; or y7=0, U to y8=1, etc.\n\nSimilarly, y7 depends on previous.\n\nThe fastest way to reach y=1 at t=8 is to go down early.\n\nFor example, at t=3: D, y4=1\n\nBut at t=4, on y=1, which is safe except at t=6.\n\nt=4: Δt=1 for y=1 car, [-35,-24], safe.\n\nThen we can stay at y=1 or move.\n\nBut at t=6, we must not be on y=1.\n\nSo from y4=1, we need to leave before t=6 or at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, position y6.\n\nIf y6=1, dangerous.\n\nSo we must have y6 ≠1.\n\nFor example, at t=4: U, y5=2\n\nt=5: U, y6=3 or something.\n\nThen later come back to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut let's calculate net.\n\nWe need y8=1.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=7 actions.\n\ny3=2.\n\nSuppose at t=3: D, y4=1\n\nt=4: U, y5=2\n\nt=5: U, y6=3\n\nt=6: U, y7=4\n\nt=7: need to get to y8=1, but from y7=4, y8 between 3 and 5, cannot be 1.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=3: S, y4=2\n\nt=4: D, y5=1\n\nt=5: since at t=6 must not be on y=1, so at t=5, action to make y6≠1.\n\nIf y5=1, action at t=5: U, y6=2; or D, y6=0; or S, y6=1 not allowed.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nSay U, y6=2\n\nt=6: on y=2, safe\n\nThen need to get to y8=1.\n\ny6=2, action at t=6: say D, y7=1\n\nThen at t=7, on y=1, safe since not t=6.\n\nThen action at t=7: to have y8=1, so S, y8=1\n\nThen t=8: S, y9=1\n\nThen go up.\n\nSame as before.\n\nt=5: from y5=1, action D, y6=0\n\nThen t=6: on y=0, safe\n\nThen action at t=6: U, y7=1\n\nt=7: S, y8=1\n\nt=8: S, y9=1\n\nThen go up.\n\nStill similar.\n\nAnd from y=1 to y=9 takes 8 steps.\n\nSo minimal H is 15.\n\nBut let's accept that and write the sequence.\n\nTo save one turn, but I think 15 is the best.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=1 at t=8 and t=9, but at t=9 we can start going up immediately.\n\nBut y9=1, then U at t=9 to y10=2, etc.\n\nNo saving.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=8 and t=9 we can be on y=1, and y=1 is safe, and from there we go up, but during the go up, at t=10, y=2, which is safe after t=9, etc.\n\nSo let's provide a sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart at t=3, y=2\n\nAction at t=3: S, so y4=2 at t=4\n\nAction at t=4: S, y5=2 at t=5\n\nAction at t=5: S, y6=2 at t=6  (safe, on y=2)\n\nAction at t=6: D, so y7=1 at t=7\n\nAction at t=7: S, so y8=1 at t=8\n\nAction at t=8: S, so y9=1 at t=9\n\nNow at t=8 and t=9, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen action at t=9: U, y10=2 at t=10\n\nt=10: U, y11=3\n\nt=11: U, y12=4\n\nt=12: U, y13=5\n\nt=13: U, y14=6\n\nt=14: U, y15=7\n\nt=15: U, y16=8\n\nt=16: U, y17=9\n\ny17=9 at t=17.\n\nAfter action at t=16: U, y17=9.\n\nTime t=17, position y=9.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=16, that's 14 actions? t=3 to t=16 inclusive: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: 14 actions.\n\ny_{3+H} = y_{17} =9, so 3+H=17, H=14.\n\nEarlier I had 15, but now 14.\n\nList:\n\nActions:\n\nt=3: S  (y4=2)\n\nt=4: S  (y5=2)\n\nt=5: S  (y6=2)\n\nt=6: D  (y7=1)\n\nt=7: S  (y8=1)\n\nt=8: S  (y9=1)\n\nt=9: U  (y10=2)\n\nt=10: U (y11=3)\n\nt=11: U (y12=4)\n\nt=12: U (y13=5)\n\nt=13: U (y14=6)\n\nt=14: U (y15=7)\n\nt=15: U (y16=8)\n\nt=16: U (y17=9)\n\nYes, actions at t=3 to t=16, 14 actions, y at t=17=9.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, t1=3.\n\nSo t from 3 to 3+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, time t=3+H, position y_{3+H}.\n\nHere y_{17}=9, so 3+H=17, H=14.\n\nActions at t=3 to t=16.\n\nIn the output, we need to list actions starting from t=3.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=6, we did D to go to y=1 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=6, we were on y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=7, on y=1, safe.\n\nt=8, y=1, safe.\n\nt=9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nTotal 14 actions.\n\nCan we do with 13?\n\nSuppose we reach y=1 earlier at t=8 but with fewer S.\n\nFor example, at t=3: D, y4=1\n\nThen at t=4, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen to avoid t=6 on y=1, at t=4: U, y5=2\n\nt=5: U, y6=3\n\nt=6: on y=3, safe\n\nThen need y8=1.\n\nFrom y6=3, action at t=6: D, y7=2\n\nt=7: D, y8=1\n\nThen y8=1\n\nThen t=8: S, y9=1\n\nThen go up from t=9.\n\nActions: t=3: D, t=4: U, t=5: U, t=6: D, t=7: D, t=8: S, t=9: U, ..., up to y=9.\n\nFrom t=9 U to t=16 U for y17=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter t=8: S, y9=1\n\nt=9: U, y10=2\n\n...\n\nTo y17=9, need actions up to t=16 U.\n\nActions: t=3 D, t=4 U, t=5 U, t=6 D, t=7 D, t=8 S, t=9 U, t=10 U, ..., t=16 U.\n\nFrom t=9 to t=16 is 8 actions: U each, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps.\n\nBut t=9 to t=16 is 8 actions, plus t=3 to t=8: t=3,4,5,6,7,8: 6 actions, total 14 actions again.\n\nSame as before.\n\nt=3: action, to t=16 action, 14 actions.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 with less, but I think 14 is minimal.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had three S at beginning, here we have more movements, but same number.\n\nSo H=14 seems achievable.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the first sequence I had:\n\nTurn t_1: S (for t=3)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: S (t=4)\n\n...\n\nBut let's write for the given t1=3.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, we need to make sure no collision at other points.\n\nFor example, in the sequence: at t=4, y=2, safe; t=5, y=2, safe; t=6, y=2, safe (as span [-17,-6]? At t=6, on y=2, Δt=3, span [-41+18, -30+18]= [-23,-12], no 0); t=7, y=1, Δt=4 for y=1 car, [-47+48, -36+48]= [1,12]?

Δt=7, -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], no 0; similarly all safe.\n\nSo ok.\n\nTo save one action, but I think not possible.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately but avoid the critical times by being on y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to y=4 or 5, then down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut to reach y=1 at t=8 from higher y, we need to start down early.\n\nFor instance, at t=3: U, y4=3\n\nt=4: U, y5=4\n\nt=5: D, y6=3\n\nt=6: D, y7=2\n\nt=7: D, y8=1\n\nThen t=8: S, y9=1\n\nThen t=9: U, y10=2, etc to y17=9.\n\nActions: t=3 U, t=4 U, t=5 D, t=6 D, t=7 D, t=8 S, t=9 U, ..., t=16 U.\n\nt=9 U to t=16 U: 8 actions (t=9 to16)\n\nt=3 to t=8: 6 actions, total 14, same.\n\nNo saving.\n\nSo minimal H is 14.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I'll use the first one with fewer moves.\n\nBut in terms of actions, same.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we didn't go there in this sequence, so fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} for t_1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter Turn 16 action U, at time 17, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from Turn 3 to Turn 16, which is 14 turns.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut let's confirm the vertical axis: y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=9 is the goal.\n\nIn the sequence, at Turn 6: D, from y=2 to y=1 at time 7.\n\nThen S at 7 and 8 to stay at y=1 for time 8 and 9.\n\nThen U from 9 to 16.\n\nH=14.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier, but we need to be at y=1 at time 8 and 9.\n\nFor example, if at t=3: U, y4=3\n\nBut then we need to come down, which might not save actions.\n\nI think 14 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the action list, Turn 3 to Turn 16, that's 14 lines.\n\nIn the format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSince t_1=3, Turn 3: S, Turn 4: S, ..., up to Turn 16: U.\n\nAfter Turn 16 action, at time 17, position (0,9).\n\nAnd we avoided collisions.\n\nTo make it shorter, but I think not possible.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we go to y=1 earlier and wait, but then we have to stay through t=6 not on y=1.\n\nFor example, t=3: D, y4=1\n\nt=4: U, y5=2  (to avoid t=6 on y=1)\n\nt=5: S, y6=2\n\nt=6: S, y7=2? Then need to go to y=1.\n\nt=6: D, y7=1\n\nt=7: S, y8=1\n\nt=8: S, y9=1\n\nThen same as before, but from t=3 to t=8: D,U,S,D,S,S — 6 actions, then U from t=9 to t=16, 8 actions, total 14.\n\nSame.\n\nSo I think H=14 is the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 14. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any dangerous freeway at critical times. Specifically:\n\n- The player stays at \\(y = 2\\) for turns 3 to 5 to avoid the danger on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, the player moves down to \\(y = 1\\) to prepare for the critical turns 8 and 9.\n- The player stays at \\(y = 1\\) for turns 7 and 8 (positions at times 8 and 9) because \\(y = 1\\) is safe at these times, while freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- From turn 9 onwards, the player moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\), as all freeways are safe after turn 9.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 3 (action S)**: Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (position at time 4: \\((0, 2)\\); safe, as freeway 2 car span at time 4 is \\([-35, -24]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 4 (action S)**: Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (position at time 5: \\((0, 2)\\); safe, span at time 5 is \\([-29, -18]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 5 (action S)**: Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (position at time 6: \\((0, 2)\\); safe, span at time 6 is \\([-23, -12]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 6 (action D)**: Move down to \\(y = 1\\) (position at time 7: \\((0, 1)\\); safe, span for freeway 1 at time 7 is \\([1, 12]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 7 (action S)**: Stay at \\(y = 1\\) (position at time 8: \\((0, 1)\\); safe, span at time 8 is \\([13, 24]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 8 (action S)**: Stay at \\(y = 1\\) (position at time 9: \\((0, 1)\\); safe, span at time 9 is \\([25, 36]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 9 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (position at time 10: \\((0, 2)\\); safe, span for freeway 2 at time 10 is \\([1, 12]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 10 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (position at time 11: \\((0, 3)\\); safe, span at time 11 is \\([7, 18]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 11 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) (position at time 12: \\((0, 4)\\); safe, span at time 12 is \\([13, 24]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 12 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (position at time 13: \\((0, 5)\\); safe, span at time 13 is \\([19, 30]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 13 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) (position at time 14: \\((0, 6)\\); safe, span at time 14 is \\([25, 36]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 14 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) (position at time 15: \\((0, 7)\\); safe, as cars on freeway 7 at time 15: first car span \\([19, 30]\\), second car \\([55, 66]\\), third car \\([67, 78]\\), all no 0).\n- **Turn 15 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) (position at time 16: \\((0, 8)\\); safe, cars on freeway 8 at time 16 similar to freeway 7, no 0).\n- **Turn 16 (action U)**: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) (position at time 17: \\((0, 9)\\); goal reached, no freeway at y=9).\n\nAfter 14 actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at time 17. This sequence minimizes \\(H\\) while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t_1 = 6, but in the task, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", and in the state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 = 6\". That might be a typo. Looking back: \"suppose current turn is {t_1}\", and then \"Current Turn: t_0 = 6\". Probably t_0 is meant to be t_1, so current turn is 6. I'll assume that.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2. Actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed. Collision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}. If you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, at turn T you are still on y_T, so you only check for collision on y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if player is on freeway k (meaning y_T = k), and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=6, and we need to compute their positions at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars at t=6.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=12. Since direction is right, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head > tail, so span [tail, head] I think? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail, and since left-moving, head decreases, so at time T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and at time T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) = (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSince direction is right, at t_1=6, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-11 + 12(T-6), 0 + 12(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision at turn T on freeway k if player is on k at T, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, I assume, since player is at (0,y).\n\nNow, for freeway 1 at T, span is [ -11 + 12(T-6), 12(T-6) ]\n\n0 is in this span if -11 + 12(T-6) ≤ 0 ≤ 12(T-6)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12) → at T, span: [-11 + 12(T-6), 12(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6) → at T, span: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6)]\n\nSince d=right, span [τ, h] at t_1, so [ -23, -12 ] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [ -23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6) → same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: first (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6), second (h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=6)? Head and tail: for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? 24 and 13, 24>13, so head=24, tail=13, d=right, s=6.\n\nSimilarly, third: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nSince player starts at y=2, and needs to go to y=9, which is above, so probably need to go up, but y=9 is the goal, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but collision only on freeways y=1 to 8, I think.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe. But player can be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, since no cars.\n\nBut goal is to reach (0,9), so when at (0,9), it's done.\n\nNow, current y=2, at turn 6.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding being on a freeway y=1 to 8 when there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is dangerous, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nCar: at T, span [ -11 + 12(T-6), 12(T-6) ]\n\nSet Δt = T - 6, so from turn 6 onwards.\n\nAt T, span [ -11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt ]\n\n0 in span iff -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nWhich is 12 Δt ≥ 0 and 12 Δt ≥ 11? From inequalities:\n\n-11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 12 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 0, which is always true for T≥6.\n\nSecond, -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/12\n\nBut Δt is integer, since turns are discrete, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSo Δt integer, Δt ≥0.\n\nThen 12 Δt ≤ 11? 12 Δt ≤ 11, but 12 Δt is multiple of 12? No, Δt integer.\n\n12 Δt ≤ 11: for Δt=0, 0≤11 true; Δt=1, 12≤11 false. So only for Δt=0.\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 12 Δt: for Δt=0, 0≤0 true; Δt=1,0≤12 true, but the first inequality fails.\n\nSo only when Δt=0, -11 +0 ≤0≤0, which is -11≤0≤0, 0≤0 is true, -11≤0 true.\n\nFor Δt=1, -11+12=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false.\n\nSo only at T=6, freeway 1 has a car at x=0? At T=6, span [-11,0], so x=0 is included, since tail -11, head 0, so [ -11,0] includes 0.\n\nAt T=7, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous only at T=6.\n\nBut player is at y=2 at T=6, not on freeway 1, so no issue. Freeway 1 is y=1, player at y=2.\n\nNow freeway 2: car: at T, span [ -23 + 6 Δt, -12 + 6 Δt ] with Δt = T-6\n\n0 in span iff -23 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 6 Δt\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n1. -23 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 Δt ≤ 23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so Δt ≤ 3 since integer\n\n2. 0 ≤ -12 + 6 Δt ⇒ 12 ≤ 6 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 2\n\nSo for Δt=2 and Δt=3.\n\nΔt=2: -23+12 = -11 ≤0, and 0 ≤ -12+12=0, so 0≤0 true.\n\nΔt=3: -23+18= -5 ≤0, 0 ≤ -12+18=6, true.\n\nΔt=4: -23+24=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false.\n\nSo freeway 2 dangerous at T=6+2=8 and T=6+3=9? T=8 and T=9.\n\nΔt=2, T=8; Δt=3, T=9.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car configuration, so dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=8,9\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6) → span at T: [ -23 + 6 Δt, -12 + 6 Δt ]\n\nDangerous when Δt=2 and 3, T=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=6) → at t_1, span [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 + 6 Δt, 24 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span? 13 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 6 Δt? But 13 + 6 Δt ≥13 >0 for Δt≥0, so left end >0, so 0 cannot be ≤ left end, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=6) → [49 + 6 Δt, 60 + 6 Δt], all positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only the first car is dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars, so dangerous at T=8 and T=9 from the first car.\n\nNow, what about other times? For example, freeway 1 only at T=6, but player not there.\n\nFreeways 2-6 dangerous at T=8 and 9.\n\nFreeways 7-8 dangerous at T=8 and 9.\n\nNow, player at y=2 at T=6.\n\ny=2 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt T=6, player is on y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nIs freeway 2 dangerous at T=6?\n\nFor freeway 2, at T=6, Δt=0, span [ -23 +0, -12 +0] = [-23,-12], 0 not in [-23,-12], since -12 <0? -12 is less than 0, and -23 < -12, so [-23,-12] is from -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not in it.\n\nEarlier for freeway 2, dangerous only at T=8,9.\n\nAt T=6, for freeway 2, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7, freeway 2: Δt=1, span [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], still negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt T=8: Δt=2, [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nT=9: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=10: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, player at T=6, y=2, freeway 2, but safe since no car at x=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way is to go up: U each turn, but y from 2 to 9, need 7 steps? Start at y=2, after one U, y=3, then 4,5,6,7,8,9, so 7 actions to reach y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nAt which turns will player be on which y.\n\nSuppose we go straight up: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U from t=6 to t=12? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T.\n\nStart: T=6, y=2\n\nAction at T=6: if a_6=U, then y_{7} = 3\n\na_7=U, y_8=4\n\na_8=U, y_9=5\n\na_9=U, y_10=6\n\na_10=U, y_11=7\n\na_11=U, y_12=8\n\na_12=U, y_13=9, reached at T=13.\n\nBut we need to check for each T from 6 to 12, since at T=13, y=9, which is not freeway, safe.\n\nT from 6 to 12, y from 2 to 8? y_T: T=6, y=2; T=7, y=3; T=8, y=4; T=9, y=5; T=10, y=6; T=11, y=7; T=12, y=8.\n\nThen at T=13, y=9.\n\nNow, collisions: at each T, if y_T between 1 and 8, check if freeway y_T has car at x=0.\n\nT=6: y=2, freeway 2. At T=6, freeway 2 safe, as above.\n\nT=7: y=3, freeway 3. At T=7, freeway 3: Δt=1, span [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=8: y=4, freeway 4. At T=8, freeway 4 dangerous? Freeway 4 has same as freeway 2, dangerous at T=8 and 9.\n\nAt T=8, for freeway 4, since same car, span [-11,0], so 0 covered, collision if on freeway 4 at T=8.\n\nBut player at T=8 is on y=4, which is freeway 4, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: y=5, freeway 5, dangerous at T=9, span [-5,6], 0 in, collision.\n\nT=10: y=6, freeway 6. At T=10, freeway 6: Δt=4, span [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=11: y=7, freeway 7. At T=11, freeway 7: Δt=5, for first car: [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18], 0 not in. Other cars not near 0, so safe.\n\nT=12: y=8, freeway 8. Similarly, at T=12, Δt=6, first car: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, collision if we go straight up.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nPossible to delay or something.\n\nSince dangerous times are T=8 and T=9 for freeways 2-8.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway k=2 to 8, dangerous at T=8 and T=9? Freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 all dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous only at T=6, not issue.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, all freeways y=2 to 8 have cars covering x=0? y=1 to 8, but y=1: freeway 1 dangerous only at T=6, not at 8 or 9.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 1: Δt=2, span [-11+24, 0+24]= [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at T=8: [-11,0], dangerous.\n\nBut freeway 1 is safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, freeway 1: Δt=3, [ -11+36, 0+36]? Earlier: span at T for freeway 1: [ -11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt ]\n\nAt T=9, Δt=3, [ -11+36, 36]? 12*3=36, so [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, freeways 2 through 8 are dangerous, but freeway 1 is safe.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=6.\n\nWe need to be not on freeway 2-8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nPossible to go down to y=1 or y=0, or up to y=9, but y=9 is far.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, need to pass through.\n\nSince T=8 and 9 are dangerous, we can be on y=1 or y=0 or y=9 at those times.\n\nBut y=9 is not reached yet in few turns.\n\nMinimal turns to reach y=9 from y=2 is 7, but with collisions.\n\nWe might need to take a detour or wait.\n\nFor example, at T=6, instead of going up, go down to y=1 or y=0.\n\ny=1 is freeway, but at T=6, freeway 1 is dangerous? At T=6, freeway 1: span [-11,0], includes 0, so if on y=1 at T=6, collision.\n\nPlayer at T=6 is at y=2, not on y=1.\n\nBut if we go down at T=6.\n\nOptions:\n\nAt T=6, y=2.\n\nAction a_6:\n\nIf S, stay at y=2, then at T=7, y=2 still? Action at T determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T, choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nSo at T=6, y_6=2, choose a_6.\n\nIf a_6 = U, then y_7 = 3\n\nIf a_6 = D, then y_7 = 1\n\nIf a_6 = S, then y_7 = 2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 must be reached at some T, and we need minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart at t1=6, position at turn t1 is given.\n\nWe apply actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, so H actions, to reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t1, position (0, y_{t1})\n\nAfter one action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn this case, from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so minimal H is 7 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns are T=8 and T=9, where all freeways y=2 to 8 have collisions, but y=1 and y=0 are safe at those times.\n\ny=0 is always safe, no freeway.\n\ny=1 is freeway, but at T=8 and T=9, freeway 1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 1: [13,24], no 0.\n\nT=9: [25,36], no 0.\n\nSo y=1 is safe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, to avoid collision at T=8 and T=9, player should not be on y=2 to 8 at those turns.\n\nSo at turn T=8, y_8 should be 0,1, or 9.\n\nSimilarly for T=9, y_9 should be 0,1,9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable by then.\n\nNow, current at T=6, y=2.\n\nAfter two actions, at T=8, y_8.\n\nFrom y=2, to reach y=0,1, or 9 at T=8.\n\nT=8 is two turns from now: from T=6 to T=7 to T=8.\n\nActions at T=6 and T=7 determine y_8.\n\ny_8 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\ny_6=2.\n\nΔy can be -1,0,+1.\n\nSo y_8 can be from 2-1-1=0 to 2+1+1=4.\n\nMin y_8=0, max y_8=4.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 from y_8 + Δy_8, so from 0 to 5 or something.\n\nBut we need y_8 to be 0 or 1 to be safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nNow, y_8 min 0, max 4, so possible y_8=0 or 1.\n\nFor example, if a_6 = D, then y_7=1\n\nThen a_7 = D, y_8=0\n\nOr a_7 = S, y_8=1\n\nOr a_7 = U, y_8=2, but y=2 not safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if a_6 = S, y_7=2, then a_7 must be D to get y_8=1, or S for y_8=2, not safe.\n\nIf a_6 = U, y_7=3, then a_7 must be D to get y_8=2, not safe, or S for y_8=3 not safe, U for y_8=4, not safe since y=4 is freeway 4, dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo only if we go down to y=1 or y=0 at T=8.\n\nSpecifically, y_8=0 or 1.\n\nTo achieve that:\n\nOption 1: a_6 = D, then y_7=1\n\nThen at T=7, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nIs it safe? At T=7, freeway 1: Δt=1, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen a_7: if D, y_8=0, safe (no freeway)\n\nIf S, y_8=1, and at T=8, freeway 1 safe, as above.\n\nIf U, y_8=2, but y=2 dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo for safety at T=8, we must have a_7 = D or S, so y_8=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, another option: a_6 = S, y_7=2, then a_7 must be D to get y_8=1 (since if S, y_8=2 dangerous; if U, y_8=3 dangerous).\n\nIf a_6=S, y_7=2, then a_7=D, y_8=1, which is safe at T=8.\n\nIf a_6=U, y_7=3, then to get to y=1 or 0, need a_7=D, y_8=2, not safe; or a_7=S, y_8=3 not safe; a_7=U, y_8=4 not safe. So cannot reach safe y at T=8 from y_7=3.\n\nTherefore, only possibilities for safe T=8 are:\n\n- a_6 = D, then a_7 = D or S (y_8=0 or 1)\n\n- or a_6 = S, then a_7 = D (y_8=1)\n\nIf a_6=S and a_7=D, y_8=1.\n\nNow, similarly, we need to consider T=9.\n\nBut first, let's list possible paths to avoid collision at T=8.\n\nCase 1: a_6 = D, y_7=1\n\nThen at T=7, y=1, safe as above.\n\nThen a_7: if D, y_8=0\n\nIf S, y_8=1\n\nBoth safe at T=8.\n\nNow, at T=9, we need y_9 safe, i.e., not on 2-8, so y_9=0,1,9.\n\nBut y_9 from y_8.\n\nIf y_8=0, then a_8: D not possible, y cannot below 0, so S or U.\n\nIf S, y_9=0, safe\n\nIf U, y_9=1, safe\n\nIf y_8=1, then a_8: D to y_9=0, S to y_9=1, U to y_9=2.\n\nBut y_9=2 dangerous at T=9, so must not U, so must D or S, y_9=0 or 1.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 eventually, so staying low might delay.\n\nSimilarly, if we had a_6=S, a_7=D, then y_7=2 (at T=7), then y_8=1 (at T=8)\n\nThen at T=8, y=1 safe.\n\nThen a_8: similarly, must D or S to keep y_9=0 or 1, not U to y_9=2.\n\nSo in all cases, to avoid collision at T=8 and T=9, we need to be on y=0 or y=1 at both T=8 and T=9.\n\nBecause at T=9, if on y=2-8, collision.\n\nSo y_8 and y_9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, from above, we can achieve y_8=0 or 1 with appropriate actions.\n\nThen for y_9, if y_8=0, y_9 can be 0 or 1 (S or U)\n\nIf y_8=1, y_9 can be 0 or 1 (D or S)\n\nIn both cases, we can set y_9=0 or 1.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should then go up as fast as possible after T=9.\n\nT=9 is safe if y_9=0 or 1.\n\nThen after that, go to y=9.\n\nBut we need to start from T=6.\n\nFirst, let's choose a sequence to be low at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example, one way: at T=6, a_6 = D, then y_7=1\n\nThen at T=7, a_7 = S, then y_8=1\n\nThen at T=8, a_8 = S, then y_9=1\n\nNow, at T=9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=9, to y=9, need 8 up actions? y_9=1, after one U, y_10=2, then to y=9, need 7 more U? y_10=2, y_11=3, ..., y_16=8, y_17=9. So at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut T=9, turn 9, to turn 17, 8 actions? Positions: start from y_9=1\n\nAction a_9: U, y_10=2\n\na_10: U, y_11=3\n\n...\n\na_15: U, y_16=8\n\na_16: U, y_17=9\n\nSo 8 actions from a_9 to a_16, 8 steps, to reach at turn 17.\n\nBut we started from turn 6, with actions from a_6 to a_16? Let's count turns.\n\nAt turn T=6: position, before action\n\nAfter action a_6, at turn 7\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_k, at turn k+1.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nWith actions starting from t1=6.\n\nSequence of actions: a_6, a_7, ..., up to a_{t1 + H -1} such that after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nSo for H actions, we reach at turn 6 + H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions applied at turns 6 to 6+H-1, position at turns 6 to 6+H.\n\nAt turn 6: y_6 given\n\nAfter a_6, y_7\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{6+H-1}, y_{6+H}\n\nSet y_{6+H} =9.\n\nIn the above, if we do a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, then at turn 9, y_9=1.\n\nThen need to go from y=1 to y=9, which takes 8 actions: a_9 to a_{16}, y_{17}=9.\n\nSo H = number of actions from a_6 to a_{16}, that's 11 actions? a_6 to a_16 is 11 actions (6 to 16 inclusive, 11 terms), to reach at turn 17.\n\nt1=6, actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, position at t=6+H.\n\nHere, at turn 17, y=9, so 6+H=17, H=11.\n\nBut minimal without obstacles is 7, so this is slow.\n\nWe can be at y=0 at T=8 or T=9, but similar.\n\nTo save time, after T=9, we can go up fast, but we have to pass through the dangerous freeways, but after T=9, the dangerous period is over.\n\nAfter T=9, for T=10 onwards, all freeways are safe? Let's check.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at T=10: Δt=4, span [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=11: [ -23+30, -12+30]=[7,18], safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 also safe after T=9.\n\nSo from T=10 onwards, all freeways are safe to be on, no cars at x=0.\n\nTherefore, we can go up directly after T=9.\n\nNow, at T=9, we need to be at some y, but to avoid collision, at T=8 and T=9, we must be on y=0 or 1.\n\nBut at T=9, if we are on y=1, we can start going up.\n\ny=1 at T=9 is safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should be as high as possible at T=9, but since we must be on 0 or 1 at T=9, we can be on y=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=9, to y=9, need 8 steps: y_10=2, y_11=3, ..., y_17=9.\n\nBut we can be on y=0 at T=9, but that is lower, worse.\n\nAt T=8, if we are on y=1, we can go up at T=8, but at T=8, if we go up to y=2, but y=2 is dangerous at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, if we are on y=1 (safe), and we choose a_8=U, then y_9=2.\n\nBut at T=9, y=2 is dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we cannot go up at T=8 if it puts us on dangerous y at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, if we are on y=0, and a_8=U, y_9=1, safe.\n\nBut still, at T=9, y=1.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we need to be higher at some point.\n\nSince the dangerous times are only T=8 and T=9, we can be on higher y before or after, but before T=8, we have turns T=6 and T=7.\n\nAt T=6, y=2, safe.\n\nT=7, y=?, if we go up, y=3 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, freeway 3: Δt=1, span [-17,-6], safe, as before.\n\nThen at T=7, y=3, we need to get to safe y for T=8.\n\nBut from y=3, as we saw, we cannot reach y=0 or 1 in one step to T=8.\n\ny_8 must be from y_7 + Δy_7, y_7=3, so y_8=2,3,4, all dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at T=8 if we are on y=3 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=4 at T=7, worse.\n\nSo the only way is to go down at T=6 to y=1 or stay and go down, but we must be at y=1 or 0 at T=7 to reach y=0 or 1 at T=8.\n\nAt T=7, we can be on y=1 or 0 or 2, but y=2 at T=7 is safe, as we saw, freeway 2 at T=7: Δt=1, span [-17,-6], safe.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=7, to reach safe y at T=8, we need y_8=0 or 1.\n\nWith a_7, from y=2, a_7=D, y_8=1; or S, y_8=2 dangerous; U, y_8=3 dangerous. So must do a_7=D to get y_8=1.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=7 y=1, then a_7=D or S to y_8=0 or 1.\n\nSo in summary, to avoid collision at T=8 and T=9, we must have y_8 = 0 or 1, and y_9 = 0 or 1.\n\nThen from T=10 onwards, we can go up freely to y=9.\n\nThe fastest is to be at y=1 at T=9, so that we start from there.\n\nNow, from start: at T=6, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y_8=0 or 1 and y_9=0 or 1.\n\nTo minimize time to y=9, we should maximize y at T=9, so y_9=1 better than 0.\n\nSet y_9=1.\n\nThen from T=9, y=1, to y=9, need 8 up actions, reach at turn 17.\n\nBut we can have y_8=1, then at T=8, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_8, if we do S, y_9=1; or D, y_9=0; or U, but U to y=2 dangerous at T=9, so cannot.\n\nSo must do S or D at a_8, so y_9=1 or 0.\n\nThen at T=9, y=1 or 0.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut from T=6 to T=8, we need to get to y_8=1 or 0.\n\nFrom y_6=2, to y_8.\n\nWith two actions: a_6 and a_7.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\n- a_6 = D, y_7=1; then a_7 = S, y_8=1; or a_7=D, y_8=0\n\n- a_6 = S, y_7=2; then a_7 = D, y_8=1\n\n- a_6 = U, y_7=3; then cannot reach y=0 or1 at y_8, as y_8=2,3,4 all dangerous.\n\nSo only the first two options.\n\nTo have y_9=1, we can:\n\nIf y_8=1, then a_8=S, y_9=1\n\nIf y_8=0, then a_8=U, y_9=1\n\nIf y_8=1 and a_8=D, y_9=0, then from there go up.\n\nBut to have y_9=1, we can arrange.\n\nFor example, choose a sequence such that y_8=1 and a_8=S, y_9=1\n\nOr y_8=0 and a_8=U, y_9=1\n\nNow, to reach y_8=1, we can do:\n\nOption A: a_6 = D, a_7 = S, then y_7=1, y_8=1\n\nThen a_8 = S, y_9=1\n\nOption B: a_6 = S, a_7 = D, then y_7=2, y_8=1\n\nThen a_8 = S, y_9=1\n\nIn option B, at T=7, y=2, which is safe.\n\nBoth options get to y_9=1 at T=9.\n\nThen from there, go up: a_9=U, y_10=2\n\na_10=U, y_11=3\n\n...\n\na_15=U, y_16=8\n\na_16=U, y_17=9\n\nSo at turn 17, y=9.\n\nWith actions from a_6 to a_16, 11 actions.\n\nH=11, reach at turn 6+11=17.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 at T=9, but from y=2 at T=6 to y=9 at T=9, need y_9=9.\n\ny_9 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\ny_6=2, so need +7 in three steps, but each Δy <=1, so max increase 3, to y=5, cannot reach 9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before T=9 or something.\n\nEarliest possible y=9: if we go up every step, y_6=2, a_6=U, y_7=3; a_7=U, y_8=4; a_8=U, y_9=5; ... to y_12=8, y_13=9 at turn 13, but with collisions at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince we must avoid T=8 and T=9 on freeways 2-8, we have to be low at those times.\n\nAfter T=9, we can go up fast.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher after T=9?\n\nFor example, at T=8, if we are on y=1, but we cannot go up because y_9 would be 2, dangerous.\n\nUnless we can be on y=9 at T=9, but impossible from start.\n\ny=9 at T=9 not possible.\n\nPerhaps at T=10, but we need to pass through.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=8 and T=9, y=0 and y=1 are safe, and y=9 is safe but far, but what about being on y=9 at T=8 or T=9? Impossible.\n\nOr, can we reach y=9 before T=8?\n\nAt T=6, y=2.\n\nAfter two actions: a_6 and a_7, y_8 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nMax y_8=2+1+1=4, as before.\n\nThen from y_8=4, to y=9, need 5 more up actions, reach at turn 13, but at T=8, if y=4, and we are on freeway 4, which is dangerous at T=8, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nIf we could be at y=9 at turn 8, impossible.\n\nSo the detour is necessary.\n\nBut perhaps we can be on y=0 or 1 only at T=8, and then at T=9 go up, but at T=9, if we go to y=2, collision.\n\nSo we must be on 0 or 1 at both T=8 and T=9.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen the minimal H is 11, as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nStart: turn 6, y=2\n\nWe do actions to have y_9=1.\n\nFor example, with option B: a_6=S, y_7=2 (at T=7)\n\na_7=D, y_8=1 (T=8)\n\na_8=S, y_9=1 (T=9)\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=2 (T=10)\n\na_10=U, y_11=3 (T=11)\n\na_11=U, y_12=4 (T=12)\n\na_12=U, y_13=5 (T=13)\n\na_13=U, y_14=6 (T=14)\n\na_14=U, y_15=7 (T=15)\n\na_15=U, y_16=8 (T=16)\n\na_16=U, y_17=9 (T=17)\n\nActions from a_6 to a_16, that's 11 actions: t=6 to t=16.\n\nReach at turn 17.\n\nH=11.\n\nWith option A: a_6=D, y_7=1 (T=7)\n\na_7=S, y_8=1 (T=8)\n\na_8=S, y_9=1 (T=9)\n\nThen same as above, a_9 to a_16 U, y_17=9.\n\nAlso 11 actions.\n\nCan we save time?\n\nSuppose at T=9, we are on y=1, but instead of going up directly, but no, we have to go up.\n\nAfter T=9, all clear, so going up is fastest.\n\nPerhaps we can be on a higher y at T=10.\n\nBut at T=9, we are at y=1, so y_10=2 at best.\n\nUnless at T=8, we are on y=0, and at a_8=U, y_9=1, same as before.\n\nOr, at T=8, y=1, a_8=S, y_9=1.\n\nNo better.\n\nAnother thought: at T=6, if we go down to y=1 immediately, but at T=6, if we go down, a_6=D, y_7=1.\n\nAt T=7, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at a_7, we could go up, but if a_7=U, then y_8=2, but at T=8, y=2 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo cannot go up at T=7.\n\nMust stay or go down.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier by being on y=9 at turn 10 or something, but from y=1 at T=9, y_10=2, so turn 10 at y=2, then to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y at T=9, but we can't because of the danger.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be on 0 or 1 at both, but let's see the car positions again.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, freeways 2-8 are dangerous, but freeway 1 is safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nBut is there any other safe y? No, only 0 and 1.\n\ny=9 safe but not reachable.\n\nSo I think 11 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states to see if I missed something.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but only the first one is dangerous at T=8 and 9, others not, but still dangerous.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, not dangerous at T=8,9? No, all 2-8 are.\n\nFreeway 1 is not dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nBut we are using y=1.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go down, we need to make sure no collision during the move.\n\nFor example, in option B: a_6=S, at T=6, y=2, action S, so y_7=2.\n\nAt T=6, y=2, freeway 2, safe as before.\n\nAt T=7, y=2, freeway 2, at T=7, Δt=1, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_7=D, so y_8=1.\n\nAt T=8, y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen a_8=S, y_9=1, at T=9, y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nNow, from y=1 at T=9, to y=9, 8 steps.\n\nBut y=9 is reached at turn 17.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut perhaps we can go up faster after, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at T=9, we are at y=1, but if we could be at y=2 at T=10, but at T=10, it is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=2, one step.\n\nThen to y=9, 7 more steps, total from T=9 to T=17, same.\n\nBut at T=9, if we are at y=1, we can do a_9=U to y_10=2.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut we need to output the action sequence for minimal H.\n\nH=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in less than 11 actions.\n\nSuppose we do not avoid at T=8, but at T=8, if we are on y=2-8, collision, must avoid.\n\nUnless for some y, it is not dangerous, but all are.\n\nFreeway 1 is safe, but only y=1.\n\nSo I think 11 is the best.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, in the action, when we go down, we need to make sure at the turns, no collision.\n\nIn the path above, all safe.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=6.\n\nWe need actions from a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, with H=11, so to a_{16}.\n\nPosition at turn 17.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 6: S (stay, so y_7=2)\n\nIn option B: a_6=S, so at turn 6, action S.\n\nThen turn 7: D (down, y_8=1)\n\nThen turn 8: S (stay, y_9=1)\n\nThen turn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9.\n\nWith option A: a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, then a_9 to a_16 U.\n\nIn that case, at turn 6, action D, so from y=2 to y=1.\n\nAt T=6, y=2, action D, so y_7=1.\n\nAt T=7, y=1, which is freeway 1, and at T=7, freeway 1 safe, as span [1,12], no 0.\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=1, safe.\n\na_8=S, y_9=1, safe.\n\nThen same up.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nPerhaps we can save one action by not staying at y=1.\n\nFor example, at T=8, if we are on y=1, and we do a_8=U, but then y_9=2, which at T=9 is dangerous.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=9, if we are on y=0, and go up to y=1, same as before.\n\nNo.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, from a_9 to a_16, 8 actions to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\ny_9=1, y_10=2, ..., y_17=9, yes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at turn 16? How?\n\ny_16=9.\n\nFrom y_9=1, to y_16=9, 7 steps? y_10=2, y_11=3, y_12=4, y_13=5, y_14=6, y_15=7, y_16=8, then y_17=9, so after 8 actions from a_9 to a_16, y_17=9.\n\nTo have y_16=9, need to start from higher, but at T=9, y=1, impossible to be at y=9 earlier.\n\nSo turn 17 is earliest.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions from turn t_1=6.\n\nSo for example:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 8: S, but we are at y=1, and staying, then from turn 9 to 16, all U.\n\nWe can have at turn 8, instead of S, do something else, but if we do U, y_9=2, dangerous.\n\nD, y_9=0, then from there go up, but y_9=0, then a_9=U, y_10=1, then a_10=U, y_11=2, etc, to y_17=9, same number of actions, but later because we start from lower.\n\ny_9=0, then to y=9, need 9 actions? y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_17=8, y_18=9, so at turn 18, worse.\n\nSo better to have y_9=1.\n\nThus, the sequence above is good.\n\nWith the other option: Turn 6: D, Turn 7: S, Turn 8: S, then Turn 9 to 16 U.\n\nSame length.\n\nI think we should pick one.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be in a box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=6, I think.\n\nIn the state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 = 6\", but in the task, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", so probably t_1=6.\n\nI'll assume that.\n\nSo actions from turn 6 to turn 16.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nLet me write:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTo reach at turn 17.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nPerhaps we can go up immediately after T=9, but we have to wait until T=9 to be safe.\n\nAnother idea: at T=6, we go up to y=3, but at T=7, y=3 safe, but then at T=8, we must be on y=0 or1, impossible, so we have to go down before.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=0 at T=8, then at T=8, a_8=U, y_9=1, then same.\n\nBut y_9=1 same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nI think 11 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in 10 actions or less, but from y=2 to y=9, minimal 7 actions, but with 2 turns lost due to danger, so 9 actions? But we need to spend actions to go down or stay.\n\nIn terms of net movement, from y=2 to y=9, need +7, but we go down to y=1, which is -1, so net we need +8, but with the detour, we have extra actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions: for example, in the sequence above, actions: S, D, S, then 8 U.\n\nS and D are not contributing to up, so we have 2 wasted actions, plus 7 to go up from y=2, but since we go to y=1, we need 8 up, so 2 down/stay + 8 up = 10 actions? Let's count: a_6=S (no change), a_7=D (down), a_8=S (no change), so from turn 6 to turn 9, we are still at y=1, which is only one up from start? Start y=2, end y=1 at T=9, so we lost one level.\n\nThen from y=1 to y=9, 8 up actions.\n\nTotal actions: 3 to get to y=1 at T=9 (from T=6 to T=9), but with actions at T=6,7,8.\n\nThen 8 actions to go up.\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nIf we could go directly without losing level, but we have to avoid the danger.\n\nPerhaps at T=6, go down to y=1, but then at T=7, we are at y=1, we could go up at T=7, but if a_7=U, y_8=2, dangerous.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, I have Turn 8: S, but we can do without that S.\n\nFor example, in option, at T=8, if we are at y=1, we can do a_8=S to stay at y=1 for T=9.\n\nBut if we do a_8=D, go to y=0 at T=9, worse.\n\nOr, if we are at y=0 at T=8, we can do a_8=U to y=1 at T=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we are at y=1 at T=8.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nTo save an action, but we need to be at y=0 or 1 at both turns, so we must have an action that keeps us there.\n\nNo way to save an action.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's use the other option to avoid going down at T=7.\n\nWith a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=S, then U from 9 to 16.\n\na_6=D, so at turn 6, action D.\n\nThen turn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nThen U to 16.\n\nSame length.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where at T=9 we are at y=1, but with fewer actions to reach y=9, but no.\n\nAnother thought: after T=9, since all clear, we can go up, but y=1 to y=9 takes 8 steps.\n\nBut at T=10, we are at y=2, which is safe, etc.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo I'll go with one sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This requires a sequence of actions from turn 6 to turn 16, reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17.\n\nThe dangerous turns are \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\), where all freeways from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) have cars covering the x-position 0, leading to a collision if the player is on any of these freeways. To avoid collisions, the player must be on \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at turns 8 and 9, as these positions are safe:\n- \\(y = 0\\) has no freeway and is always safe.\n- \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) is safe at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\) because no car covers x=0 at these times (span at \\(T=8\\) is [13, 24], at \\(T=9\\) is [25, 36]).\n\nThe sequence starts at \\(y = 2\\) (turn 6). To reach \\(y = 1\\) by turn 8 and stay there until turn 9:\n- At turn 6, action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 at \\(T=6\\) has span [-23, -12], 0 not in span).\n- At turn 7, action \\(D\\) (down) moves to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at \\(T=7\\) has span [1, 12], 0 not in span).\n- At turn 8, action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at \\(T=8\\) has span [13, 24], 0 not in span).\n- At turn 9, action \\(S\\) keeps \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at \\(T=9\\) has span [25, 36], 0 not in span).\n\nAfter turn 9, all freeways are safe for x=0 (e.g., freeway 2 at \\(T=10\\): span [1, 12], 0 not in span), so the player can move up directly to \\(y = 9\\):\n- From turn 10 to turn 16, actions \\(U\\) (up) each turn increase \\(y\\) from 2 to 9, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 11 actions (turns 6 to 16), with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 8, and the player starts at y=0.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So from y=0, I can only go up or stay; I can't go down because y would be negative.\n\nNow, the cars: there are cars on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t1=8, with head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head=24, tail=13, direction=right, speed=12. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so positions increase.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince head is larger than tail for right-moving, I think. In the table, for freeway 1: head=24, tail=13, so head > tail, and direction right, so yes, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars, like on freeway 2: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, so head=0 > tail=-11, so moving right.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at some y, and for that y (freeway), there is a car where 0 is in its span at time T. Meaning the car is covering position x=0 at that time.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but the player is always at x=0, I think? The position is given as (0, y_t), so player is always on x=0. And cars are on the freeways, which are horizontal lanes, I assume, so cars are moving left or right, and their positions are in x-direction.\n\nSo for each freeway y, cars are moving in x-direction, and player is at (0,y) at each turn.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is at y_T, and for that y, there is a car whose span includes x=0 at time T.\n\nAlso, note: when the player moves to a new y, at the turn when they move, they are not considered on the new y until the next state. Let me read that.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThat means: at turn T, when you are at position (0, y_T), you might collide with cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move to a different y at turn T, say from y_T to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check collision with cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check with cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe key point is that when you arrive at a new row, you only care about the cars at the time you arrive, not during the move or anything. The collision is checked per turn based on where you are.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9, minimizing turns, avoiding being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=0 is the start, and at y=0, there might be no cars or something? But in this case, at turn t1=8, player is at (0,0), and we need to move to (0,9).\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars; only y=1 to 8 have cars. So probably, y=0 and y=9 are safe, meaning no cars to collide with.\n\nSimilarly, when at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at turn 8, and need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, actions: at each turn, we choose U, D, S.\n\nSince we want to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway and each time, whether x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway at that time.\n\nTime is measured from t1=8, so let τ = T - t1, the number of turns after t1.\n\nSo at time T, τ = T - 8.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, I can compute the span at time T.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at time T, if any car has 0 in its span, then it's occupied, so player should not be on that y at time T.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe to be on that y at time T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check for each freeway and time whether x=0 is covered.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: head=24, tail=13, dir=right, speed=12\n\nFor right-moving, span at time T: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ = T - t1 = T - 8\n\ns=12, h=24, τ=13? Tail is τ=13.\n\nIn the span, it's [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] for right-moving.\n\nIn notation: [τ_car + s*(T-t1), h_car + s*(T-t1)] where τ_car and h_car are the tail and head at t1.\n\nFor freeway 1: τ_car = 13, h_car = 24, s=12, dir=right.\n\nSo span at T: [13 + 12*(T-8), 24 + 12*(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: one car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=6\n\nτ_car = -11, h_car = 0, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -11 + 6*(T-8), 0 + 6*(T-8) ] = [6(T-8) - 11, 6(T-8)]\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (0, -11, right, 6)\" so identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, \"(0, -11, right, 6)\"\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: multiple cars: \"(0, -11, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6), (-42, -53, right, 6)\"\n\nThree cars.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7: \"(0, -11, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6), (-42, -53, right, 6)\"\n\nNow for each, I need to find when x=0 is in the span for that car.\n\nx=0 is covered if for some car, low <= 0 <= high, where [low, high] is the span.\n\nSince the spans might overlap, but for each freeway, I need to know for each time T whether 0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nFirst, let's handle freeways with single car, like 1 to 6 except 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, span at T: [13 + 12(T-8), 24 + 12(T-8)]\n\nSet low = 13 + 12(τ), high = 24 + 12(τ), where τ = T-8\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high\n\nBut low = 13 + 12τ, which for τ >=0, low >=13 >0, so low >0, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 is never in [low,high] since low >0. So for freeway 1, x=0 is never covered, so it's always safe? low =13 +12τ >=13 >0, and high even larger, so 0 is left of low, not in span. So for all T, no car covers x=0 on freeway 1. So freeway 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nIs that right? τ = T-8 >=0 for T>=8.\n\nAt T=8, τ=0, span = [13+0, 24+0] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nAs time increases, the car moves right, so span moves right, always positive, so x=0 never covered. Yes, so freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: car with τ_car=-11, h_car=0, s=6, dir=right.\n\nSpan at T: [ -11 + 6(τ), 0 + 6(τ) ] = [6τ -11, 6τ] where τ = T-8\n\n0 in [6τ -11, 6τ] iff 6τ -11 <= 0 <= 6τ\n\nWhich is iff 6τ -11 <= 0 and 0 <= 6τ, but 0<=6τ is true for τ>=0, since τ=0,6*0=0, 0<=0 true.\n\n6τ -11 <=0 iff 6τ <=11 iff τ <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nSince τ integer, τ <=1\n\nAlso, 0 <= 6τ always for τ>=0.\n\nSo 0 in span iff 6τ -11 <= 0 <= 6τ iff τ <=1 since τ integer.\n\nτ=0: [6*0 -11, 0] = [-11,0], 0 is included, since <=0 and >= -11? 0 <=0 and 0 >= -11, yes, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nτ=1: [6*1 -11, 6*1] = [6-11,6] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nτ=2: [12-11,12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nτ=3: [18-11,18]=[7,18], etc., all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, occupied when τ=0 or τ=1, i.e., T=8 or T=9.\n\nSafe for τ>=2, T>=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since identical car. So occupied at T=8,9; safe T>=10.\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied T=8,9; safe T>=10.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 6) same as above.\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 6) head=36, tail=25, s=6, dir=right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ_car + s(τ), h_car + s(τ)] = [25 + 6(τ), 36 + 6(τ)] where τ=T-8\n\nLow = 25 + 6τ >=25 >0 for τ>=0, so always positive, 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-42, -53, right, 6) tail=-53, head=-42, s=6, dir=right.\n\nSpan: [ -53 + 6τ, -42 + 6τ ]\n\n0 in this span iff -53 +6τ <= 0 <= -42 +6τ\n\nWhich is iff -53 +6τ <=0 and 0 <= -42 +6τ\n\nFirst: -53 +6τ <=0 iff 6τ <=53 iff τ <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so τ<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 +6τ iff 42 <=6τ iff τ >= 42/6 =7\n\nSo τ >=7 and τ <=8\n\nSince τ integer.\n\nτ=7: low = -53 +42 = -11, high = -42 +42=0, so [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=8: low= -53 +48= -5, high= -42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=9: low= -53+54=1, high= -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for τ<7 or τ>8, not covered.\n\nNow, the first car on freeway 7: (0, -11, right, 6), same as before, span [6τ -11, 6τ], occupied when τ=0,1 as before.\n\nSecond car never covers 0.\n\nThird car covers when τ=7,8.\n\nSo for freeway 7, we need to see when any car covers 0.\n\nAt τ=0: first car covers, since [ -11,0] includes 0.\n\nAt τ=1: first car covers, [-5,6] includes 0.\n\nAt τ=2: no car, first car [1,12] no, second [25+12,36+12]=[37,48] no, third [-53+12,-42+12]=[-41,-30] no, all not include 0.\n\nSimilarly, τ=3 to τ=6: similar, all spans away from 0.\n\nτ=3: first car [6*3-11,18]=[18-11,18]=[7,18] no\n\nSecond [25+18,36+18]=[43,54] no\n\nThird [-53+18,-42+18]=[-35,-24] no\n\nUp to τ=6: first car [36-11,36]=[25,36] no\n\nSecond [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] no? s=6, τ=6, [25+36,36+36]? s(τ)=6*6=36, so [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] no\n\nThird [-53+36,-42+36]=[-17,-6] no, 0 not in.\n\nτ=7: first car [42-11,42]=[31,42] no? 6τ=42, low=42-11=31, high=42, [31,42] no\n\nBut third car: [ -53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], yes, 0 in.\n\nAlso, first car at τ=7: [6*7 -11, 42] = [42-11,42] = [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond not.\n\nSo at τ=7, only third car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly τ=8: first car [48-11,48]=[37,48] no\n\nThird car [-53+48, -42+48]=[-5,6], 0 in.\n\nSecond not.\n\nτ=9: first [54-11,54]=[43,54] no\n\nThird [-53+54, -42+54]=[1,12] no\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied when:\n\n- τ=0: by first car\n\n- τ=1: by first car\n\n- τ=7: by third car\n\n- τ=8: by third car\n\nAnd safe otherwise, for τ=2,3,4,5,6,9,10,...\n\nNow freeway 8 is identical to freeway 7, so same occupancy: occupied at τ=0,1,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is occupied (x=0 covered):\n\n- Freeway 1: always safe\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied τ=0,1 (T=8,9); safe τ>=2 (T>=10)\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2, occ τ=0,1; safe τ>=2\n\n- Freeway 4: same, occ τ=0,1; safe τ>=2\n\n- Freeway 5: same, occ τ=0,1; safe τ>=2\n\n- Freeway 6: same, occ τ=0,1; safe τ>=2\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied τ=0,1,7,8 (T=8,9,15,16)\n\n- Freeway 8: same, occ τ=0,1,7,8\n\nτ=T-8, so T=8+τ.\n\nT=8: τ=0\n\nT=9: τ=1\n\nT=10: τ=2\n\n...\n\nT=15: τ=7\n\nT=16: τ=8\n\nT=17: τ=9, etc.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn T=8.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, also safe.\n\nBut to get there, we need to pass through y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt each turn, when we are at a y, if y between 1 and 8, we need that at that time, the freeway is not occupied.\n\nOtherwise, collision.\n\nSince we move one row at a time, and we can stay or move up or down.\n\nBut since we start at y=0 and want to go to y=9, and it's faster to go up, we should mostly move up.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, we can go up 9 times in 9 turns: from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, arriving at y=9 on turn 17? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=8, position y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at T=9, y could be 0 or 1.\n\nGenerally, after t actions, we can be at y between 0 and t, but since we start from 0.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so minimal H=9 turns? Not necessarily, because we might stay or move down, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, we should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably we need exactly 9 up moves, but we might need to wait sometimes, so H could be more.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from turn t1=8, after H turns, we are at turn t1+H, position y.\n\nWe start at turn t1=8, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9, and minimize H.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t1 to t1 + H-1, H actions.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nAt time t1, we are at y, and we choose action for that turn.\n\nThen at time t1+1, we move to new y based on action.\n\nAnd so on, up to time t1 + H-1, we choose action, and at time t1 + H, we are at new position, which should be y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, the minimal number of up moves needed is 9, and if we only move up, it takes 9 actions: at turn t1, action U, to y=1 at t1+1; but let's clarify the timing.\n\nSet t1=8.\n\nAt turn T=8, position y=0.\n\nWe choose action a_8.\n\nThen at turn T=9, y_9 = y_8 + Δy, with Δy based on a_8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, choose a_9, y_10 = y_9 + Δy based on a_9, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn T=8+k, y_{8+k} = y_8 + sum of Δy from t=8 to 8+k-1.\n\ny_8 = 0.\n\nWe want y_{8+H} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe position at time T=8+H is y_{8+H}.\n\nTo have y_{8+H} = 9, since y_8=0, we need the net displacement to be +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and the number of actions is at least 9, since each U increases y by 1.\n\nIf we have S, it doesn't change, so to minimize H, we should avoid S and D, only use U when possible, but we might need to wait if a row is occupied.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from T=8 to T=8+H, we have H actions: a_{8} to a_{8+H-1}, and position after H actions is at T=8+H.\n\ny_{8+H} = 0 + sum_{t=8}^{8+H-1} Δy_t\n\nWe want this sum to be 9.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so to have sum=9, we need at least 9 U actions, and no D actions, because D would decrease, requiring more U, increasing H.\n\nSimilarly, S actions keep y the same, requiring more U to compensate, so H increases.\n\nTherefore, to minimize H, we should never use D or S, only use U, unless forced to wait or something.\n\nBut with the car constraints, we might need to stay or even move down to avoid being on a bad row at a bad time.\n\nBut moving down might not help and would increase H, so probably we avoid D.\n\nSimilarly, S might be used to wait.\n\nBut since we can only change y by 1 per turn, we need to be on each row at some point.\n\nNow, the critical part is that when we are on a row y (1-8) at time T, it must be safe, i.e., not occupied.\n\nSince we start from y=0 and go up, we will be on y=k at some time for k=1 to 8, and then y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe always, I assume.\n\nNow, for the path, we need to choose the times when we are on each row.\n\nLet me denote the time when we arrive at row y.\n\nSince we move step by step.\n\nStart at T=8, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at T=9, we can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf we move up at T=8, at T=9 we are at y=1.\n\nThen at T=9, we choose action, and so on.\n\nThe time when we are at y for y=1 to 8 must be safe for that row.\n\ny=0 at T=8 is safe.\n\ny=9 when we reach it, safe.\n\nNow, let me list the safe times for each row.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): always safe, so we can be on y=1 at any time.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): occupied at T=8,9; safe for T>=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 (y=3): same, occupied T=8,9; safe T>=10.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): same, occupied T=8,9; safe T>=10.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same, occupied T=8,9; safe T>=10.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, occupied T=8,9; safe T>=10.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): occupied at T=8,9,15,16; safe at other times, specifically T=10,11,12,13,14,17,etc.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same as y=7, occupied T=8,9,15,16; safe T=10,11,12,13,14,17,...\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, so we need to visit each y from 1 to 8 exactly once, I assume, since we move one step at a time and no diagonal, so we must pass through each integer y.\n\nThe time when we are on each y must be safe.\n\nSince we start at T=8, y=0, and we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=1 is T=9, if we move up at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, earliest at y=2 is T=10, and so on, up to y=9 at T=17.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nNow, for y=2 to y=6, they are occupied at T=8 and 9, but since we are not on them at T=8 (we are at y=0), and at T=9, we might be at y=1 if we moved up, or still at y=0.\n\nBut for y=2, we cannot be on it at T=9 or earlier, since T=8 we are at y=0, T=9 we are at y=0 or 1, not 2.\n\nSo the first possible time to be on y=2 is T=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=3, earliest T=11, etc.\n\nBut with the safe times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor y=2: safe for T>=10, so earliest T=10.\n\nSimilarly y=3: safe T>=10, earliest T=10? But we can be at y=3 at T=10 only if we moved up multiple times, but from y=0 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=0.\n\nAfter one move (T=9), y=0 or 1.\n\nAfter two moves (T=10), y=0,1, or 2.\n\nSimilarly, after k moves, at T=8+k, y between max(0,0+k- something) but since we start from 0 and move up, y <= k.\n\nSpecifically, at time T=8+k, y can be from 0 to k.\n\nTo be at y=2 at T=10: possible, if we go up at T=8 and T=9: from T=8, a=U, T=9 y=1; a=U, T=10 y=2.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=3 at T=11: need three up moves, etc.\n\nBut for y=2, we need to be on it at some T>=10, which is possible since earliest T=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=3: safe T>=10, earliest possible T=10? At T=10, with two moves, y can be 0,1,2, not 3. Since each move increases by at most 1, from T=8 to T=10, two moves, y <= 2.\n\nSo earliest at y=3 is T=11.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=12, y=5 at T=13, y=6 at T=14, y=7 at T=15, y=8 at T=16, y=9 at T=17.\n\nNow, but we have constraints on when we can be on each row.\n\nFirst, for y=1: always safe, so we can be on it at any time, including T=9.\n\ny=2: must be at T>=10, and earliest T=10.\n\ny=3: must be at T>=10, earliest T=11.\n\nSimilarly y=4: safe T>=10, earliest T=12.\n\ny=5: safe T>=10, earliest T=13.\n\ny=6: safe T>=10, earliest T=14.\n\nNow y=7: occupied at T=8,9,15,16; safe at T=10,11,12,13,14,17,...\n\nEarliest possible T=10? At T=10, y can be at most 2, as above, so cannot be at y=7 until later.\n\nSimilarly, y=8: same as y=7, safe at T=10,11,12,13,14,17,...\n\nEarliest at y=8 is T=16? From above pattern.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we need to be on each row at a safe time.\n\nThe critical rows are y=7 and y=8, which have limited safe times.\n\nSpecifically, y=7 is safe at T=10,11,12,13,14,17,... but not at T=15,16.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at same times: T=10,11,12,13,14,17,... not T=15,16.\n\nBut we can be on y=7 only from T=11 onwards? Let's see the possible times we can be on each y.\n\nSince we move sequentially, the time we are on y must be consistent with the movement.\n\nLet t_y be the time when we are on row y.\n\nThen t_0 = 8 (given)\n\nt_9 is when we reach goal, y=9.\n\nFor y from 1 to 8, t_y must be safe for that row.\n\nAnd |t_y - t_{y-1}| = 1, since we move to adjacent row in one turn, but when we move, at time t, we are at y, then we move, at time t+1 we are at y±1 or same.\n\nThe time we are on row y is a single time t_y, and at that time, we are on y.\n\nThen t_{y} = t_{y-1} + d_y, where d_y is 0 or 1 or more if we stay, but since we can stay, t_y could be equal to t_{y-1} if we stay, but when we stay, we are on the same row at consecutive times.\n\nIn terms of when we first arrive or when we are present.\n\nFor collision, it's per turn: at each turn, if we are on a row y between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that time.\n\nSo we need to specify for each turn where we are.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should not stay unnecessarily, so we will be on each row only once, I think, except possibly waiting.\n\nBut since moving down would increase H, we avoid that.\n\nSo assume we only move up or stay, no down.\n\nThen the path is non-decreasing y.\n\nWe start at y=0, t=8.\n\nThen we go to y=1 at some t>8, but since we can move at t=8 to y=1 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=1 to y=2, etc.\n\nThe times when we increase y.\n\nLet me define the arrival time at each y.\n\nSet t_0 = 8.\n\nThen for y=1, we arrive at some time t_1 > t_0, and at t_1, we are on y=1 for the first time, or at that time.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we might stay multiple times, but to save time, we don't stay.\n\nSo suppose we move up as soon as possible, but only if safe.\n\nNow, t_1: we can arrive at y=1 at t=9, since y=1 always safe.\n\nt_2: arrive at y=2, must be at t>=10, and we can arrive at t=10 if we go from y=1 to y=2 at t=10? At time t, we are at some y, choose action, at t+1 new y.\n\nSo if at time t we are at y, and we choose U, then at t+1 we are at y+1.\n\nThe time when we are on y is when we arrive.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=0.\n\nIf we choose U at t=8, then at t=9, we are at y=1.\n\nSo we are on y=1 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=9 we choose U, at t=10 we are on y=2, and so on.\n\nIf we choose S at some point, we stay on the same y for multiple turns.\n\nFor y=2, we need to be on it at some t>=10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for y=7, we need to be on it at t where safe: t=10,11,12,13,14,17,... but not 15,16.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut the possible t for y=7 depend on when we can reach it.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=7 is t=15: from t=8 y=0, after 7 up moves, at t=15 y=7.\n\nSimilarly, latest? But we want early.\n\nt=15 is possible, but at t=15, y=7 is occupied? For y=7, occupied at t=15? t=15 is T=15, which is τ=7, and for freeway 7, occupied at τ=7, which is T=15, yes.\n\nSimilarly, t=16 occupied.\n\nSo at t=15 and 16, y=7 is occupied, so we cannot be on y=7 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, safe times are t=10,11,12,13,14,17,...\n\nBut can we be on y=7 at t=10? At t=10, from start, after 2 moves, y<=2, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, t=11: after 3 moves, y<=3.\n\nt=12: y<=4\n\nt=13: y<=5\n\nt=14: y<=6\n\nt=15: y<=7\n\nSo at t=14, y<=6, so we can be at y=6 at earliest t=14.\n\nThen to be at y=7, at t=15.\n\nBut t=15 is not safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=7 at t=16 if we stay or something, but t=16 also not safe.\n\nThe next possible safe time is t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, we can be at y=7 only if we arrived earlier or something.\n\nLet's list possible arrival times.\n\nAt t=8, y=0.\n\nAfter k moves (actions), at time t=8+k, y = number of U minus number of D, but no D, so y <= k.\n\nTo be at y=7, we need at least 7 up moves, so at time t=8+m, with m>=7, y=7 only if we have exactly 7 U and m-7 S actions, so t=8+m with m>=7.\n\nSimilarly, the time t when we are on y=7 satisfies t >= 8+7 =15.\n\nSimilarly, t <= ? but not bound.\n\nNow, at t, with t>=15, and we are on y=7 only if we have taken 7 U by then or something.\n\nBut the point is that t must be in {10,11,12,13,14,17,18,...} but since t>=15, the only possibilities are t=17,18,etc., because t=10 to 14 are less than 15, impossible.\n\nt=10 to 14 are all less than 15, so we cannot be on y=7 at those times.\n\nThe safe times before t=15 are t=10,11,12,13,14, all <=14<15, so impossible to be on y=7 then.\n\nTherefore, the only possible safe times for y=7 are t>=17, since t=15 and 16 are occupied, t=17 is safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nt=17: τ=17-8=9, for freeway 7, at τ=9, safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly t=18, etc.\n\nSo for y=7, we must be on it at t>=17.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same thing.\n\nNow, for y=7, earliest possible t=15, but not safe, so must be at least t=17.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=17, that means at time t=17, we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, for y=1 to y=6, they can be visited early.\n\ny=1: can be at t=9\n\ny=2: must be at t>=10, can be at t=10\n\ny=3: must be at t>=10, can be at t=11? At t=10, y<=2, so y=3 at earliest t=11.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=12, y=5 at t=13, y=6 at t=14.\n\nAll these times are safe, since for y=2 to 6, safe for t>=10, and t=10,11,12,13,14 are all >=10.\n\nNow, after y=6 at t=14, we need to go to y=7.\n\nBut we cannot go to y=7 at t=15 because it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, not at t=16.\n\nAt t=14, we are at y=6.\n\nWe can choose to stay at y=6 or move up to y=7.\n\nBut if we move up at t=14, at t=15 we are at y=7, but y=7 occupied at t=15, collision.\n\nIf we stay at t=14, then at t=15 we are still at y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=15: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6: we said occupied only at t=8,9, safe for t>=10.\n\nt=15 >=10, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15, if we are at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, we can choose to stay or move up or down.\n\nBut if we move up to y=7 at t=16, but y=7 occupied at t=16, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=6, at t=16 we are at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, if we move up to y=7 at t=17, now t=17, y=7 is safe? t=17, τ=9, freeway 7 safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go to y=8.\n\nSo let's outline the path.\n\nStart t=8, y=0.\n\nWe can move up at t=8 to y=1 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=1, safe (y=1 always safe).\n\nMove up to y=2 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=2, which is safe since t=10>=10.\n\nMove up to y=3 at t=11.\n\ny=3 at t=11 safe.\n\nMove up to y=4 at t=12.\n\ny=4 at t=12 safe.\n\nMove up to y=5 at t=13.\n\ny=5 at t=13 safe.\n\nMove up to y=6 at t=14.\n\ny=6 at t=14 safe.\n\nNow at t=14, we are at y=6.\n\nIf we move up, to y=7 at t=15, but y=7 occupied at t=15, not safe.\n\nSo we must not move up at t=14.\n\nInstead, we can stay at y=6.\n\nAt t=14, choose S (stay), so at t=15, still y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=15 safe, as above.\n\nNow at t=15, we are at y=6.\n\nIf we move up, to y=7 at t=16, but y=7 occupied at t=16, not safe.\n\nSo we must stay again at t=15.\n\nChoose S, so at t=16, still y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=16 safe.\n\nNow at t=16, we can move up to y=7 at t=17.\n\nt=17, y=7: τ=9, freeway 7 safe, yes.\n\nSo at t=17, y=7, safe.\n\nNow from here, we need to go to y=8.\n\ny=8 must be safe at that time.\n\ny=8 safe at t=10,11,12,13,14,17,... not 15,16.\n\nt=17 is safe for y=8? Freeway 8 same as 7, at τ=9, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we can move up from y=7 to y=8 at t=17? At t=17, we are at y=7, choose U, then at t=18 we are at y=8.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at t=17, and we choose action to go to y=8 at t=18.\n\nThen at t=18, we are at y=8.\n\nNow, is y=8 safe at t=18? t=18, τ=10, freeway 8: at τ=10, for the cars, earlier we said for freeway 7/8, at τ=10, safe, since not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=18 safe.\n\nThen we can move up to y=9 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, y=9, goal.\n\nBut we started at t=8, and at t=19 we are at y=9.\n\nH = number of turns? From t1=8 to when we reach y=9.\n\nAt t=8, we start, after H actions, at t=8+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, we reached y=9 at t=19, so t=8+H=19, so H=11.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=18? Let's list the turns.\n\nt=8: position y=0, choose action\n\nt=9: new position based on a8\n\n...\n\nAt time t, after action at t-1.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt t=8: y=0, choose a8=U, so at t=9, y=1\n\nt=9: y=1, choose a9=U, at t=10, y=2\n\nt=10: y=2, choose a10=U, at t=11, y=3\n\nt=11: y=3, choose a11=U, at t=12, y=4\n\nt=12: y=4, choose a12=U, at t=13, y=5\n\nt=13: y=5, choose a13=U, at t=14, y=6\n\nt=14: y=6, choose a14=S (stay), so at t=15, y=6\n\nt=15: y=6, choose a15=S (stay), at t=16, y=6\n\nt=16: y=6, choose a16=U (move up), at t=17, y=7\n\nt=17: y=7, choose a17=U, at t=18, y=8\n\nt=18: y=8, choose a18=U, at t=19, y=9\n\nNow at t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nWe used actions from t=8 to t=18, that's 11 actions: t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nH=11, and at t=8+11=19, y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe had to wait at y=6 for two turns, because y=7 was occupied at t=15 and 16.\n\nCould we avoid that?\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=7 earlier by going slower or something, but earlier we cannot be on y=7 before t=15, and at t=15 and 16 it's occupied, so we must be on it at t>=17, so we need to arrive at t=17 or later.\n\nBut at t=17, we can be on it.\n\nIn the path above, we arrived at y=7 at t=17.\n\nThen we went to y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut y=8 could be visited earlier? But we cannot, because to be at y=8, we need to be at y=7 first, and y=7 only at t>=17.\n\nEarliest at y=7 is t=17, so earliest at y=8 is t=18, then y=9 at t=19.\n\nCould we be on y=8 at a safe time earlier? But we cannot reach y=8 before t=16, and at t=16 it's occupied, t=15 we cannot be on it, so must be at t>=17.\n\nBut at t=17, we can be on y=7 or y=8, but to be on y=8, we need to have arrived from below.\n\nSuppose at t=16, we are at y=6, as before, but instead of staying, we cannot go up because y=7 occupied.\n\nPerhaps we can go down, but that would make it worse.\n\nFor example, at some point, we can stay longer at lower rows to time the arrival.\n\nBut since y=7 and y=8 must be after t=16, and we can be at y=6 at t=14, we have to wait until t=16 to move to y=7 at t=17.\n\nIn the sequence, we waited at y=6 from t=14 to t=16.\n\nt=14,15,16 at y=6, then move to y=7 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=14,15,16 we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=9 earlier? Minimal would be t=17 if no cars, but with cars, we have to wait.\n\nt=17 is not possible because to be at y=9 at t=17, we need to have y=9 at t=17, which requires 9 up moves, so at t=17=8+9, so if we go up every turn from t=8 to t=16, 9 actions: a8 to a16 U, then at t=17 y=9.\n\nBut in this case, we would be on y=7 at t=15? Let's see:\n\nt=8: y=0, a=U, t=9 y=1\n\na=U, t=10 y=2\n\na=U, t=11 y=3\n\na=U, t=12 y=4\n\na=U, t=13 y=5\n\na=U, t=14 y=6\n\na=U, t=15 y=7\n\nBut at t=15, y=7 is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we try to stay somewhere.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 or something, but that delays.\n\nFor example, if we stay at t=8, S, then at t=9 y=0.\n\nBut y=0 safe, no issue.\n\nThen at t=9, we can move up to y=1 at t=10.\n\nThen y=1 at t=10, safe.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=11, but y=2 must be safe at t>=10, t=11>=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=12, y=4 t=13, y=5 t=14, y=6 t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=6, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=16, but y=7 occupied at t=16, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at t=15, S, then at t=16 y=6, then at t=16 move to y=7 at t=17, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19, same as before.\n\nBut we started later, so H larger.\n\nIn first sequence, we reached y=6 at t=14, waited two turns, to y=7 at t=17.\n\nIn this, if we start moving later, we reach y=6 later, say at t=15, then wait until t=16 to move at t=17, but at t=16 we are at y=6, move to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThen same as before, but we arrived at y=6 later, so y=9 at t=19 still, or later if we delayed more.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 at t=8, then at t=9 y=0, move up at t=9 to y=1 at t=10, etc., then y=6 at t=15, then stay at t=15? At t=15 y=6, choose S, at t=16 y=6, then at t=16 choose U, to y=7 at t=17, then U at t=17 to y=8 at t=18, U at t=18 to y=9 at t=19. Same arrival time.\n\nBut we used an extra stay at beginning, so H=11 still? Actions from t=8 to t=18, 11 actions.\n\nIn this case, with stay at t=8: actions at t=8: S, t=9: U, t=10:U, ..., up to t=18:U, to y=9 at t=19.\n\nNumber of actions: t=8 to t=18 inclusive, 11 actions.\n\nWithout initial stay, we had a8 to a18, 11 actions.\n\nMinimal H is 11.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we can be on y=7 at t=17, but we need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\ny=8 must be at safe time, which includes t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, we can be on y=8 only if we arrived from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo if at t=17 we are on y=7, we can move to y=8 at t=18.\n\nBut if we could be on y=8 at t=17 directly, but to be at y=8 at t=17, we need to have taken 8 up moves by t=17, so from t=8 to t=16, 9 actions? t=17 =8+9, so after 9 actions from t=8 to t=16, at t=17 y= position.\n\nIf we do 8 up moves and one stay, but to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nFor example: suppose we are at y=7 at t=16, but t=16 y=7 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at t=17, how?\n\nAt t=16, we must be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut y=7 at t=16 occupied, cannot.\n\ny=9 not yet.\n\ny=8 at t=16: but t=16, freeway 8 occupied, since τ=8, occupied.\n\nSo cannot be on y=8 at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, only at t>=17 safe.\n\nBut at t=17, we can be on y=8 if we move from y=7 at t=17? At t=17, we are at some y, if we are at y=7, we can move to y=8 at t=18.\n\nTo be directly at y=8 at t=17, we must have been at y=8 at t=16 or moved from y=7 or y=9.\n\nBut at t=16, we cannot be on y=8 because occupied.\n\nIf we move from y=7 to y=8 at t=17, but that means at t=17 we are moving, so at t=17 we are at y=7 when we choose action, then at t=18 at y=8.\n\nThe time when we are on y=8 is t=18.\n\nSimilarly, in all cases, we cannot be on y=8 before t=18 except if we stay, but even then, we need to arrive first.\n\nEarliest arrival at y=8 is t=16, but occupied, so must be t=17 or later.\n\nt=17: to be at y=8 at t=17, we must have taken action at t=16 from y=7 or y=9.\n\nBut at t=16, if we are at y=7, occupied, cannot choose action.\n\nIf we are at y=9, not yet.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nTherefore, earliest possible at y=8 is t=18.\n\nSimilarly, then y=9 at t=19.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have two stay actions at y=6.\n\nBut we could stay elsewhere, but it doesn't save time.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, we can be at other safe times, but since we have to go through y=6, and y=6 we can be early, but we have to wait.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go to y=7 at t=17, but from there, since y=8 is safe at t=17, but we are at y=7 at t=17, not y=8.\n\nIf we could be at y=8 at t=17, but we can't.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we used two S actions at t=14 and t=15.\n\nt=14 and t=15, both at y=6.\n\nIn terms of the actions: from t=8 to t=13, all U, to reach y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen S at t=14 and S at t=15, then U at t=16 to y=7 at t=17, U at t=17 to y=8 at t=18, U at t=18 to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut at t=16, we choose U, to go from y=6 to y=7 at t=17.\n\nNow, let's write the actions for each turn.\n\nTurn t_1 = 8.\n\nActions: a_{8}, a_{9}, ..., up to a_{8+H-1}, and at t=8+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=11, so actions from t=8 to t=18.\n\na_{8} to a_{18}.\n\nIn sequence:\n\nTurn 8: action U (to go to y=1 at t=9)\n\nTurn 9: action U (to y=2 at t=10)\n\nTurn 10: action U (to y=3 at t=11)\n\nTurn 11: action U (to y=4 at t=12)\n\nTurn 12: action U (to y=5 at t=13)\n\nTurn 13: action U (to y=6 at t=14)\n\nNow at t=14, we are at y=6, need to stay, so\n\nTurn 14: action S (stay at y=6 for t=15)\n\nAt t=15, y=6, still, need to stay again:\n\nTurn 15: action S (stay at y=6 for t=16)\n\nAt t=16, y=6, now move up:\n\nTurn 16: action U (to y=7 at t=17)\n\nAt t=17, y=7, move up:\n\nTurn 17: action U (to y=8 at t=18)\n\nAt t=18, y=8, move up:\n\nTurn 18: action U (to y=9 at t=19)\n\nAnd at t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but t_1=8, H=11, so turns from 8 to 18.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  // which is a_8\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}  // a_9\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + (H-1): a_{t_1 + H-1}  // a_{8+10}=a_{18} since H-1=10.\n\nH=11, H-1=10, so a_{8} to a_{17}? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_{t} for t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1\n\nThen at time t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=8, H=11, so actions at t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18\n\nThen at t=19, y=9.\n\nNow the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be with t_1.\n\nSince t_1=8, but the turn labels.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is U for turn 8\n\nBut since it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc., so we can write with t_1.\n\nSimilarly, \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 10: U\n\nt_1 + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18, yes.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we can reach y=9 faster, but we need to be at y=7 and y=8 at safe times, which forces us to be at y=7 at t>=17, y=8 at t>=18, y=9 at t>=19.\n\nMinimal t for y=9 is 19, so H=11 is minimal.\n\nIf we could be on y=7 at t=17, but then y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nPerhaps if we stay at a different row.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at y=6, we could stay at a lower row to make y=7 later, but since we have to arrive at y=7 at t=17, and we can be at y=6 as early as t=14, we need to spend two turns somewhere, so staying at y=6 is fine.\n\nWe could stay at y=5 or something, but that might not help and could delay if we stay earlier.\n\nFor instance, if we stay at t=13 at y=5, then we reach y=6 later, but still, we need to be at y=7 at t=17, so we might have to wait less at y=6, but the total time is the same.\n\nIn all cases, y=9 at t=19.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have two S at t_1+6 and t_1+7, which are turns 14 and 15.\n\nt_1+6 = 14, t_1+7=15.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions briefly.\n\nFor example, at t=17, y=7: T=17, τ=9, freeway 7: cars: first car [6*9 -11, 54] = [54-11,54]=[43,54] no 0\n\nSecond [25+54,36+54]=[79,90] no? s(τ)=6*9=54, [25+54,36+54]=[79,90] no\n\nThird [-53+54, -42+54]=[1,12] no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at other points, we are safe.\n\nAt t=10, y=2: T=10, τ=2, freeway 2: [6*2-11,12]=[12-11,12]=[1,12] no 0, safe since τ=2>1.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the sequence should be as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nH=11, but we don't need to output H, just the sequence.\n\nIn the box, list the actions.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nt_1 + 10 corresponds to the last action.\n\nSince t_1=8, turns from 8 to 18.\n\nIn the sequence, t_1 + 10 = 18, action U, then at t=19 y=9.\n\nPerfect.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns required is \\(H = 11\\). The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on a freeway row \\(y\\) (for \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at a time when any car on that row covers the position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)\nThe occupancy of \\(x = 0\\) for each freeway row at time \\(T\\) (where \\(\\tau = T - t_1 = T - 8\\)) is derived from the car states:\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- **Freeways 2-6**: Occupied at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\) (\\(\\tau = 0, 1\\)); safe for \\(T \\geq 10\\) (\\(\\tau \\geq 2\\)).\n- **Freeways 7 and 8**: Occupied at \\(T = 8, 9, 15, 16\\) (\\(\\tau = 0, 1, 7, 8\\)); safe at other times, including \\(T = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, \\ldots\\).\n\n### Path Constraints\n- The player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at \\(T = 8\\).\n- To minimize turns, the player should move up (\\(U\\)) whenever possible, but must avoid being on an occupied row at the wrong time.\n- Rows \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) can be safely occupied starting from \\(T = 10\\), with earliest arrival times: \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 9\\), \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 10\\), \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 11\\), \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 12\\), \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 13\\), \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 14\\).\n- For row \\(y = 7\\), the earliest possible arrival time is \\(T = 15\\), but it is occupied at \\(T = 15\\) and \\(T = 16\\). The next safe time is \\(T = 17\\). Similarly, row \\(y = 8\\) must be occupied at \\(T \\geq 17\\) (earliest safe arrival at \\(T = 18\\)).\n- Thus, the player must wait at \\(y = 6\\) for two turns (at \\(T = 15\\) and \\(T = 16\\)) to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) during unsafe times. This results in arrival at \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 17\\), \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 18\\), and \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 19\\).\n\n### Minimal Sequence of Actions\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) to turn \\(t_1 + 10 = 18\\) (11 actions) achieves the goal at turn \\(t_1 + 11 = 19\\):\n- Turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 5\\): Move up to reach \\(y = 6\\) by \\(T = 14\\).\n- Turns \\(t_1 + 6\\) and \\(t_1 + 7\\): Stay at \\(y = 6\\) to wait for \\(y = 7\\) to become safe.\n- Turns \\(t_1 + 8\\) to \\(t_1 + 10\\): Move up to reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(T = 19\\).\n\nThis sequence is minimal because:\n- Rows \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) cannot be occupied before \\(T = 17\\) and \\(T = 18\\), respectively, due to car occupancy constraints.\n- Any attempt to reach \\(y = 9\\) earlier would require being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during an unsafe time, causing collision.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are listed for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t = 0\\) to \\(10\\) (corresponding to turns 8 to 18):\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 10: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,1) at turn t1=10. I need to get to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis is from y=0 to y=9, so freeways are from y=1 to y=8, meaning there are cars on rows 1 through 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move, you're still on y_T for collision purposes, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nLet me read that note again: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you check for collision on that row at turn T. When you take an action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}, but for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t1=10. I need to compute where the cars are at future turns.\n\nLet me list all the cars per freeway at t1=10.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12). Since direction is right, and it's moving right, so at time T, position = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nHead and tail: I think head is the front, so for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be larger, so from the notation: for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end? In the table, for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12), but it says head h=48, tail τ=37. But 48>37, so if direction is right, and head is larger, then tail should be smaller, so [τ, h] = [37,48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h smaller, I assume.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut for consistency, let's define the left and right ends.\n\nFor a car, at time t, it occupies a range of x positions on its freeway.\n\nFor collision, we care about whether x=0 is occupied at time T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nPlayer is always at x=0, since it's (0,y), so we only care about the y position and whether on that y, at time T, a car covers x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have cars with their spans at t1.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12. Since dir=right, and head=48 > tail=37, so at t1, span is [37,48]? But the notation says for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so [tail, head] = [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, for update: at T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12*(T-10), 48 + 12*(T-10)]\n\nSince it's moving right, the whole thing shifts right with speed 12 per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would shift left.\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving except I need to check.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) → [37,48] at t1, moving right.\n\nFreeway 2: (12,1,right,6) → [1,12] at t1, moving right.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (12,1,right,6) → [1,12]\n\nFreeway 4: same, (12,1,right,6) → [1,12]\n\nFreeway 5: same, (12,1,right,6) → [1,12]\n\nFreeway 6: same, (12,1,right,6) → [1,12]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFirst car: [1,12] at t1, moving right.\n\nSecond car: [37,48] at t1, moving right.\n\nThird car: head=-30, tail=-41? Head=-30, tail=-41, and dir=right. Since dir=right, and head > tail? -30 > -41, so span [τ, h] = [-41, -30] at t1, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nNow, freeways 2,3,4,5,6 all have the same car: [1,12] at t1, moving right with speed 6.\n\nFreeway 1 has [37,48] at t1, moving right speed 12.\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 have three cars each: [1,12], [37,48], and [-41,-30] all moving right speed 6.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1) at turn t1=10.\n\nI need to go to (0,9). Since we can only move one step per turn in y, the minimum H would be at least 8, because from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps up. But I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so it could be more.\n\nBut let's see if I can go straight up.\n\nStart at y=1, turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, I am on y=1. I need to check if at turn 10, on freeway 1, is there a car covering x=0.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t1=10: car span [37,48], which is from 37 to 48, so x=0 is not covered. 0 is not between 37 and 48, so no collision at turn 10.\n\nNow, I can choose action at turn 10: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn where I am.\n\nSince I want to minimize H, I should try to go up as much as possible, only deviating when necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nBut let's see the cars.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 (y=1): only one car, [37,48] at t=10, moving right speed 12, so at time T, position [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)]\n\nx=0 covered when? 37 + 12(T-10) <= 0 <= 48 + 12(T-10)\n\nSince the car is moving right, and starts at 37-48, which is positive, it will never cover x=0 because x=0 is left, and it's moving right away from 0. So for y=1, x=0 is never covered by this car at any time. So freeway 1 is always safe? But there might be other cars, but freeway 1 has only one car, and it's moving away, so yes, freeway 1 is always safe for x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): car [1,12] at t=10, moving right speed 6.\n\nAt time T, span [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)]\n\nx=0 covered when 1 + 6(T-10) <= 0 <= 12 + 6(T-10)\n\nSince the span is increasing, left end 1 + 6(T-10) <= 0 and right end 12 + 6(T-10) >=0? Let's solve.\n\nSet L(T) = 1 + 6(T-10)\n\nR(T) = 12 + 6(T-10)\n\nx=0 covered if L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nL(T) <=0: 1 + 6(T-10) <=0 => 6(T-10) <= -1 => T-10 <= -1/6, but T-10 >=0 since T>=10, so L(T) =1 + something non-negative, so L(T) >=1 >0, thus L(T) >0 for all T>=10. Since L(T) >=1 >0, and R(T) > L(T) >0, so both ends positive, so 0 < L(T) <= x <= R(T), so x=0 is never covered because 0 < L(T). So freeway 2 is also always safe for x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5,6 are the same as freeway 2: each has a car [1,12] moving right, so same thing, L(T) >=1 >0, so x=0 never covered.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): three cars.\n\nFirst car: [1,12] at t=10, moving right speed 6, so as above, L(T) >=1>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: [37,48] at t=10, moving right speed 6, L(T) =37 +6(T-10) >=37>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: [-41,-30] at t=10, moving right speed 6.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-41 + 6(T-10), -30 + 6(T-10)]\n\nNow, x=0 covered if -41 + 6(T-10) <= 0 <= -30 + 6(T-10)\n\nSet A(T) = -41 + 6(T-10)\n\nB(T) = -30 + 6(T-10)\n\nA(T) <=0 <= B(T)\n\nFirst, A(T) <=0: -41 + 6(T-10) <=0 => 6(T-10) <=41 => T-10 <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so T <= 10 + 6.833 = 16.833, since T integer, T <=16\n\nSecond, B(T) >=0: -30 +6(T-10) >=0 => 6(T-10) >=30 => T-10 >=5 => T>=15\n\nSo both: T>=15 and T<=16, so for T=15 and T=16, A(T) <=0 <= B(T)\n\nAt T=15: A(15) = -41 +6(5) = -41+30= -11 <=0\n\nB(15) = -30 +30=0, so 0 <=0, which is equal, so covered.\n\nAt T=16: A(16) = -41 +6(6) = -41+36= -5 <=0\n\nB(16) = -30 +36=6 >=0, so yes, covered.\n\nAt T=14: A(14) = -41 +6(4) = -41+24= -17 <=0, but B(14) = -30 +24= -6 <0, so B(14) <0, so 0 not <= B(14), thus not covered.\n\nAt T=17: A(17) = -41 +6(7) = -41+42=1 >0, so A(17)>0, not covered.\n\nSo on freeway 7, the third car covers x=0 at T=15 and T=16.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8 (y=8): same cars as freeway 7, so also covered at T=15 and T=16.\n\nNow, freeway 7 and 8 have the issue.\n\nFreeways 1-6 are always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 9? y=9 is the target, and there are no freeways above 8, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so it's always safe, but we reach there.\n\ny=0 might have something, but player starts at y=1, and we go to y=9, so y=0 not involved.\n\nNow, player starts at y=1, turn 10.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe, as we said.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=1, no collision.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous freeways are y=7 and y=8 at turns 15 and 16.\n\nSpecifically, if I am on y=7 at turn 15 or 16, I collide with the car.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at turn 15 or 16.\n\nFor other times, y=7 and y=8 are safe, since only those cars and the other cars don't cover x=0.\n\nOn y=7, at other times, no car covers x=0, similarly for y=8.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps up, so H=8 turns? Turns from t=10 to t=17, with actions at t=10 to t=17, position at t=17 is y_17.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut position at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t and cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nI start at turn t=10, y=1.\n\nAfter H turns, I have taken actions at t=10 to t=10+H-1, and at turn t=10+H-1, y_{10+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn, at t=10, y=1, action U, then t=11, y=2, and so on, up to t=10+7=17, y=8? Let's see:\n\nt=10: y=1, after action U, y=2 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=2, after U, y=3 at t=12\n\n...\n\nt=16: y=7, after U, y=8 at t=17\n\nt=17: y=8, after U, y=9 at t=18\n\nThen at t=18, y=9, which is the target.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, so at turn t=18, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think from t=10 to t=10+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t=10+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nAfter k actions, turn is t=10+k.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter 0 actions, turn 10, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=10), turn 11, y= y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\nGenerally, y_{t} for t>10 depends on actions.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is set.\n\nTo have y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nMinimal t such that y_t=9.\n\nSince we start at t=10, y=1, and each move changes y by at most 1, min time to reach y=9 is at t=18, with all U actions: y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_18=9.\n\nt=18 is turn 18.\n\nWith H=9 actions? Let's see:\n\nActions at t=10 to t=18-1? I need to define H.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen after that, at turn t1+H, position is set, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9? No.\n\nRead carefully: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t1+H, the position is y_{t1+H}, but we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H-1}, and after action a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set, but for the position at turn t1+H-1, it must be 9.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn from t1 to when we reach, I assume, but since we stop when y=9, probably we don't care after, but we need to avoid collision until we reach.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9) at some turn, meaning that at that turn, y_t=9 and no collision at that turn or previous turns.\n\nSo for turn t, we need y_t=9 and for all s from t1 to t, no collision at turn s.\n\nIn this case, with all up, we can reach at t=18.\n\nNow, let's simulate with all U actions.\n\nStart: t=10, y=1. On freeway 1, cars: [37,48], x=0 not covered, safe.\n\nAction U: so y_{11} = y_{10} +1 =2? y_t+1 = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t, depends on y_t.\n\nt=10: y=1, safe as above.\n\nAction a_10 = U, so y_{11} = 1 +1 =2\n\nt=11: y=2, on freeway 2. Cars: [1,12] moving right, at t=11, T=11, t1=10, Δt=1, span [1+6(1), 12+6(1)] = [7,18], x=0 not covered, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{12} =2+1=3\n\nt=12: y=3, freeway 3, similar to 2, car [1+6(2)=1+12=13, 12+12=24], [13,24], 0 not covered, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{13}=4\n\nt=13: y=4, freeway 4, car [1+6(3)=1+18=19, 12+18=30], [19,30], safe.\n\nAction U, y_{14}=5\n\nt=14: y=5, freeway 5, car [1+6(4)=1+24=25, 12+24=36], [25,36], safe.\n\nAction U, y_{15}=6\n\nt=15: y=6, freeway 6, car [1+6(5)=1+30=31, 12+30=42], [31,42], safe.\n\nAction U, y_{16}=7\n\nNow t=16: y=7, on freeway 7.\n\nAt t=16, freeway 7 cars: first car [1,12] at t=10, T=16, Δt=6, [1+6*6=1+36=37, 12+36=48], [37,48], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car [37,48] at t=10, [37+36=73,48+36=84], not cover 0.\n\nThird car: [-41,-30] at t=10, T=16, [-41 +6*6= -41+36= -5, -30+36=6], so span [-5,6]\n\nx=0 is between -5 and 6, so covered! Collision at t=16.\n\nOh, so if I go straight up, at t=16, y=7, I collide with the car on freeway 7.\n\nThen I die, not good.\n\nAt t=15, I was on y=6, which is safe, but I moved to y=7 at t=16.\n\nNow, at t=16, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIf I had stayed or something, but at t=15, I was on y=6.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=15, I was on y=6, took U, so at t=16, y=7, collide.\n\nBut at t=15, on y=6, I could take S or D to avoid moving to y=7 at t=16.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nThe dangerous times for y=7 and y=8 are t=15 and t=16.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor y=7: unsafe at t=15 and t=16.\n\nAt t=15: freeway 7, third car: at T=15, span [-41 +6(5)= -41+30= -11, -30+30=0], so [-11,0], so 0 is covered (since <=0 and >=0).\n\nSimilarly at t=16: [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: same cars, same spans, so unsafe at t=15 and t=16.\n\nNow, at other times, safe.\n\nNow, y=6 is freeway 6, which has only one car [1,12], moving right, and at all times L(T) >=1 >0, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,4,3,2,1 all safe, as before.\n\ny=9 no cars, safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nWith all up, I would be at:\n\nt=10: y=1\n\nt=11: y=2\n\nt=12: y=3\n\nt=13: y=4\n\nt=14: y=5\n\nt=15: y=6\n\nt=16: y=7 → but at t=16, y=7 unsafe, collide.\n\nIf at t=15, I stay or go down, I can avoid being on y=7 at t=16.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nOne way is to delay being on y=7 or y=8 during t=15 or 16.\n\nFor example, if I am not on y=7 at t=15 or t=16, and not on y=8 at t=15 or 16, then I can be safe.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe only at t=15,16, I can be on y=7 at other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe safe times for y=7 are t<=14 or t>=17.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nt=14: on y=7, is it safe?\n\nAt t=14, freeway 7: third car span at T=14: [-41 +6(4)= -41+24= -17, -30+24= -6], so [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not covered. Other cars not cover, so safe.\n\nt=17: at T=17, span [-41 +6(7)= -41+42=1, -30+42=12], [1,12], both positive, 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: I can go up slowly or stay to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, from start:\n\nAt t=10, y=1, safe. I can go U to y=2 at t=11.\n\nt=11, y=2, safe, U to y=3 at t=12.\n\nt=12, y=3, safe, U to y=4 at t=13.\n\nt=13, y=4, safe, U to y=5 at t=14.\n\nt=14, y=5, safe. Now, if I go U, to y=6 at t=15.\n\nt=15, y=6, safe (since y=6 always safe). But at t=15, if I go U to y=7, then at t=16, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=15, y=6, I can stay: action S, so y_{16} = y_{15} +0 =6, so at t=16, still y=6.\n\nThen at t=16, y=6, safe, I can go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nNow t=17, y=7. At t=17, y=7 is safe, as we saw, span [1,12] or whatever, but third car at t=17: [-41+42=1, -30+42=12], [1,12], not cover 0.\n\nSo safe. Then action U, to y=8 at t=18.\n\nt=18, y=8. Now, y=8 at t=18: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8 at t=18: T=18, t1=10, Δt=8.\n\nCars: first [1+6*8=1+48=49,12+48=60], not cover.\n\nSecond [37+48=85,48+48=96], not.\n\nThird: [-41+48=7, -30+48=18], [7,18], not cover 0. So safe.\n\nThen action U, to y=9 at t=19.\n\nt=19, y=9, which is the target, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, what turn is this? Started t=10, y=1.\n\nAfter actions: t=10 to t=18 actions.\n\nActions: t=10: U, y11=2\n\nt=11: U, y12=3\n\nt=12: U, y13=4\n\nt=13: U, y14=5\n\nt=14: U, y15=6  (since from y5 to y6)\n\nAt t=14, y=5? Let's list positions:\n\nt=10: y=1\n\na10=U → y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, a11=U → y12=3\n\nt=12: y=3, a12=U → y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, a13=U → y14=5\n\nt=14: y=5, a14=U → y15=6\n\nt=15: y=6, now instead of U, we do S: a15=S → y16=6\n\nt=16: y=6, a16=U → y17=7\n\nt=17: y=7, a17=U → y18=8\n\nt=18: y=8, a18=U → y19=9\n\nAt t=19, y=9.\n\nWe reached at turn t=19.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=18, that's 9 actions (t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18), so H=9.\n\nAt turn t=19, we have y=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=10, H=9, t1+H-1=10+9-1=18, but at t=18, y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{10+9-1} = y_{18} =8, not 9.\n\nBut we need y_{18}=9? No.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, the position at turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAfter actions at t=10 to t=10+H-1, at turn t=10+H-1, position y_{10+H-1}.\n\nWe need this to be 9.\n\nIn my sequence, after actions at t=10 to t=18 (which is 9 actions, H=9), at turn t=10+9-1=18, y=8, but we want y=9.\n\nThen at turn t=19, y=9, but that is after the actions.\n\nTo have y_{t} =9 at turn t, with t = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I start at t=10, y=1.\n\nAfter one action, at t=11, y could be 0,1,2.\n\nTo reach y=9, min H: if I go up each time, after 8 actions: actions at t=10 to t=17, then at turn t=10+8-1=17, y_{17} =? Let's see:\n\nt=10: y=1, a10=U → y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, a11=U → y12=3\n\n...\n\nup to a16=U at t=16: y16=7? Earlier.\n\nt=10: y1\n\na10=U → t=11 y2\n\na11=U → t=12 y3\n\na12=U → t=13 y4\n\na13=U → t=14 y5\n\na14=U → t=15 y6\n\na15=U → t=16 y7\n\na16=U → t=17 y8\n\nThen at turn t=17, y=8.\n\nIf I take a17=U at t=17, then y18=9 at t=18.\n\nBut at turn t=17, y=8, which is not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t} =9 at turn t, for t=17, I need to be at y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=10, to y=9 at t=17, that would require increasing y by 8 in 7 turns? Turns from t=10 to t=17 is 7 turns? No.\n\nTime from t=10 to t=17 is 7 steps? Let's think of the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\ny_10 =1\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\n...\n\ny_17 = y_10 + sum_{k=10 to 16} Δy_k\n\nSince each Δy is -1,0,1, to go from y10=1 to y17=9, need sum of 7 deltas to be +8, but each delta <=1, so max increase is 7 in 7 steps, to y17=1+7=8, cannot reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nMinimal turn to reach y=9: since start at t=10 y=1, each move can increase by at most 1, so earliest at t=18, y=9.\n\ny_10=1\n\ny_11 <=2\n\n...\n\ny_18 <=9, and can be 9 if all U.\n\nSimilarly, y_17 <=1+7=8.\n\nSo minimal possible turn to be at y=9 is t=18.\n\nAt t=18, y=9.\n\nNow, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with t1=10, so t1 + H -1 =18, so 10 + H -1 =18, thus H=9.\n\nYes, H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=10 to t=10+9-1=18? t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nH=9, actions at t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nThen at turn t=10+9-1=18, y_{18}=9.\n\nIn the all up without avoiding, at t=16 y=7 collide, but we need to avoid.\n\nIn my earlier sequence with stay, I had actions up to t=18 to reach y=19=9, but that was wrong for the position at t=18.\n\nLet's correct.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn 18.\n\nSo y_18=9.\n\ny_18 depends on previous.\n\nFrom y_10=1, after 8 actions (from t=10 to t=17), we set y_11 to y_18.\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\n...\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\nSo y_18 = y_10 + sum_{k=10 to 17} Δy_k = 1 + sum of 8 deltas.\n\nTo have y_18=9, sum of Δy from t=10 to t=17 must be +8.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, we need all 8 actions to be U, no S or D.\n\nBut if all U, then y_11=2, y_12=3, ..., y_17=8, y_18=9.\n\nAt turn t=16, y_16=7 (since y_16 =1 +6 for k=10 to15? y_11=2, y_12=3, y_13=4, y_14=5, y_15=6, y_16=7, y_17=8, y_18=9.\n\nAt t=16, y=7, which is unsafe, as we saw.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 at t=16, or on y=7 at t=15? t=15 y=6, t=16 y=7.\n\nAt t=16, y=7, which is the problem.\n\nTo avoid, we need that at t=16, we are not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, we need to not be on y=8 at t=15 or t=16, but in this path, at t=15 y=6, not 8.\n\ny=8 at t=17 or something.\n\nBut in all up, at t=16 y=7, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to modify the actions so that at t=16, we are not on y=7.\n\nFor example, at t=15, instead of going to y=7, we stay or go down.\n\nBut if at t=15, y=6, if we take S, then y_16 = y_15 +0 =6, so at t=16, y=6.\n\nThen at t=16, y=6, we can take U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, y=7 is safe, as t=17>16.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at t=18.\n\nFrom t=16 y=6, action U, y_17=7\n\nThen at t=17, y=7, action U, y_18=8, but we need y_18=9, but y_18=8, not 9.\n\nProblem: we have only up to action at t=17 for y_18.\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\nIf at t=16, y=6, and we take U, then y_17=7\n\nThen at t=17, y=7, take U, y_18=8\n\nBut we need y_18=9, so it must be 8, not 9.\n\nIf at t=17, we take U, but y_18=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_18=9, we need y_17=8, and Δy_17= +1, so U.\n\nBut in this case, with the stay, we have y_17=7, which is less.\n\nSince we stayed at t=15, we lost one up, so y_18=8 instead of 9.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need one more action.\n\nFor example, at t=17, y=7, take U to y_18=8\n\nThen at t=18, y=8, take U to y_19=9\n\nThen at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nBut for H, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, at turn 10+H-1=19, so H=10.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=19-1? t1+H-1=19, so 10+H-1=19, H=10.\n\nBut earlier min H=9 is possible if no cars, but with cars, we need to take more turns or different path.\n\nCan I reach at t=18 with y=9 without being on y=7 at t=16?\n\nBut in the direct path, I have to be on y=7 at some point.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe only at t=15,16, I can be on y=7 at t=14 or t=17.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at t=14.\n\nt=14: y=7 safe.\n\nThen at t=14, y=7, I can go U to y=8 at t=15.\n\nBut t=15, y=8 is unsafe, because freeway 8 at t=15 has car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=8 at t=17, etc.\n\nLet's plan a sequence to avoid the danger zones.\n\nStart at t=10, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by t=18 with all U except I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nSpecifically, cannot be on y=7 at t=15 or t=16, cannot be on y=8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nSince y=8 at t=15 or 16 unsafe.\n\nNow, the critical turns are t=15 and t=16 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nI need to be on row 7 at t=14 or t=17, and on row 8 at t=14 or t=17 or other safe times.\n\nt=14: y=7 safe, y=8 safe? y=8 at t=14.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=14: T=14, t1=10, Δt=4.\n\nCars: third car: [-41 +6*4= -41+24= -17, -30+24= -6], [-17,-6], not cover 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=17: y=8 safe, as before.\n\nNow, possible to be on y=7 at t=14.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=8 at t=15, but t=15 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay on y=7 at t=14, action S, then y_15=7, but at t=15, y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo to y=8 at t=14? But at t=14, I can be on y=7 or other.\n\nLet's list possible positions over time.\n\nI need to have y_t for t from 10 to 18.\n\ny_10 =1\n\ny_18 =9\n\nEach step y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t, with a_t in {U: +1, D: -1, S:0}, and y between 0 and 9.\n\nConstraints: at each t, for the y_t, no collision with cars on that row at that turn.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- For y=1 to 6: always safe\n\n- y=7: safe except t=15,16\n\n- y=8: safe except t=15,16\n\n- y=9: always safe\n\n- y=0: not used, but possible, but we start from 1, go to 9, so probably not go to 0.\n\ny=0 might be safe or not, but no cars on y=0, I think, since freeways 1-8, so y=0 no cars, safe.\n\nBut we don't need to go down.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nWe need to increase y by 8 from t=10 to t=18, but from y_10 to y_18, with 8 actions (t=10 to t=17), so 8 changes, must all be U to increase by 8.\n\ny_18 = y_10 + sum_{k=10 to 17} Δy_k =1 + sum of 8 deltas.\n\nTo have +8, all deltas must be +1, so all actions U.\n\nBut then y_t = t - 9 for t from 10 to 18? y_10=1, y_11=2, ..., y_18=9.\n\nThen at t=16, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=18 with all U because of collision at t=16.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach at t=18; we must reach later, at t=19 or more.\n\nMinimal H larger than 9.\n\nH=9 would allow reaching at t=18, but not possible due to cars.\n\nSo minimal H is 10, reaching at t=19.\n\nt1 + H -1 =19, so 10 + H -1=19, H=10.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=19-1? t=10 to t=10+H-1=10+10-1=19.\n\nAt turn t=19, y_19=9.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence with H=10.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9 in 9 steps, but with 9 actions, we can increase by at most 9, but from 1 to 9 is +8, so we can have one stay or down, but we need exactly +8, so with 9 actions, sum of deltas must be +8, so one action can be S or D, but D would decrease, so better to have one S and eight U.\n\nWith H=10 actions, from t=10 to t=19, we have 10 actions to set y_11 to y_20, but we need y_19=9.\n\ny_19 = y_10 + sum_{k=10 to 18} Δy_k =1 + sum of 9 deltas.\n\nTo have y_19=9, need sum of 9 deltas = +8, so eight U and one S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, we can include a D, but that would require more U, so minimal is eight U and one other, which can be S or D, but S is better.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nt=15 and t=16 are critical.\n\nNow, let's list the turns: t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 for positions.\n\nActions at t=10 to t=18 for y_11 to y_19.\n\ny_t at t=10 to t=19.\n\nWe control actions at t=10 to t=18 to set y_11 to y_19.\n\ny_10=1 fixed.\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\n...\n\ny_19 = y_18 + Δy_18\n\nFor each t from 10 to 19, y_t must be safe.\n\nSpecifically, at t=15 and t=16, y_t must not be 7 or 8.\n\nBecause if y_t=7 or 8 at t=15 or 16, collision.\n\nAt other times, all rows safe.\n\nAlso, y_19=9.\n\nNow, since we need to go from 1 to 9, and we have 9 steps (from y10 to y19, 9 changes), so net +8.\n\nWe can have a stay somewhere.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=15,16.\n\nt=15 and 16 are around the middle.\n\nPossible to be at lower y at t=15,16.\n\nFor example, start by going up to y=5 or 6 by t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, y=5, for example.\n\nThen at t=15, I can stay on y=5 or go to y=6, both safe since y=5 and 6 always safe.\n\nThen at t=16, similarly, stay or go up.\n\nThen after t=16, go up to y=7,8,9.\n\nSince after t=16, y=7 and 8 are safe.\n\nFor instance:\n\nt=10: y=1, safe, action U → y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, safe, U → y12=3\n\nt=12: y=3, safe, U → y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, safe, U → y14=5\n\nNow t=14: y=5, safe. I can take action S or U or D.\n\nIf I take U, to y15=6\n\nt=15: y=6, safe (y=6 always safe). Action: I can take S to stay at y=6 for t=16.\n\nAction at t=15: if S, then y16=6\n\nThen t=16: y=6, safe. Action U to y17=7\n\nt=17: y=7, at t=17, safe (since t>16). Action U to y18=8\n\nt=18: y=8, at t=18, safe? Freeway 8 at t=18: as before, cars not cover 0, safe. Action U to y19=9\n\nt=19: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about y_19? At turn t=19, y=9, which is the target.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, actions from t=10 to t=18.\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U? In above, at t=14, I took U to go to y15=6.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=10: action U, y11=2\n\nt=11: action U, y12=3\n\nt=12: action U, y13=4\n\nt=13: action U, y14=5\n\nt=14: action U, y15=6  (I took U here)\n\nt=15: action S, y16=6\n\nt=16: action U, y17=7\n\nt=17: action U, y18=8\n\nt=18: action U, y19=9\n\nNow, at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nWe need to check collision at each turn:\n\nt=10: y=1, safe\n\nt=11: y=2, safe\n\nt=12: y=3, safe\n\nt=13: y=4, safe\n\nt=14: y=5, safe\n\nt=15: y=6, safe\n\nt=16: y=6, safe (still on y=6)\n\nt=17: y=7, at t=17, safe as computed\n\nt=18: y=8, at t=18, freeway 8: cars at T=18, t1=10, Δt=8, third car [-41+48=7, -30+48=18], [7,18], not cover 0, safe.\n\nt=19: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd we reached at t=19.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=18, that's 9 actions.\n\nt=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =10 +9 -1=18, but at t=18, y=8, not 9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{18} =8, but we need it to be 9.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn t=18, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen at t=19, y=9, but t=19 is not covered by the actions for the position at t=18.\n\nTo have y_{18}=9, but from above, with actions up to t=17, y_{18} is set by action at t=17.\n\ny_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17}\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=17, y=7, action U, so y_{18}=8.\n\nIf we want y_{18}=9, we need y_{17}=8 and Δy_{17}=U.\n\nBut to have y_{17}=8, we need to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at t=17.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=8 at t=17.\n\ny_17 = y_10 + sum_{k=10 to 16} Δy_k =1 + sum of 7 deltas.\n\ny_17=8, so sum of 7 deltas =7, so all U from t=10 to t=16.\n\nThen y_11=2, y_12=3, ..., y_17=8.\n\nThen at t=17, y=8, which is safe (t=17>16), then action at t=17: U, to y_18=9.\n\nThen at turn t=18, y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nWith all U from t=10 to t=16:\n\nt=10: y=1, safe\n\nt=11: y=2, safe\n\nt=12: y=3, safe\n\nt=13: y=4, safe\n\nt=14: y=5, safe\n\nt=15: y=6, safe\n\nt=16: y=7? y_16 = y_10 + sum_{k=10 to 15} Δy_k, actions at t=10 to t=15 affect y_11 to y_16.\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\ny_12 = y_11 + Δy_11 = y_10 + Δy_10 + Δy_11\n\n...\n\ny_16 = y_10 + Δy_10 + ... + Δy_15\n\nWith all U, Δy=1 each, so y_16 =1 + 6*1 =7? Actions from t=10 to t=15: 6 actions, so y_16 =1 + sum_{k=10 to15} Δy_k =1+6=7\n\nSimilarly, y_17 = y_16 + Δy_16 =7 +1=8\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17 =8+1=9\n\nAt t=16, y=7, which is unsafe, as before.\n\nCollision at t=16.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo avoid, at t=15, we need to not have y=7.\n\nBut if all U, y_16=7.\n\nSo at t=15, we must not take U if y_15=6, or something.\n\ny_15: with actions from t=10 to t=14.\n\nt=10 to t=14: 5 actions, all U: y_11=2, y_12=3, y_13=4, y_14=5, y_15=6\n\nAt t=15, y=6, safe.\n\nIf we take action at t=15: if U, y_16=7, then at t=16, y=7 collide.\n\nIf S, y_16=6, then at t=16, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at t=16, action U, y_17=7\n\nThen at t=17, y=7, safe (t=17>16), action U, y_18=8\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 at t=18, but y_18=8, not 9.\n\nThen at t=18, action U, y_19=9, but that is later.\n\nSo to reach at t=18, we must have y_18=9, which requires y_17=8 and U at t=17.\n\nBut to have y_17=8, with y_10=1, in 7 steps, must have all U from t=10 to t=16, but then y_16=7, and at t=16, if we go to y_17=8, but at t=16, we are on y=7, which is collision.\n\nIf we could be on y=8 at t=17 without being on y=7 at t=16, but from y=7 at t=16 to y=8 at t=17, but at t=16 y=7 is the problem.\n\nThe only way to avoid collision at t=16 is to not be on y=7 at t=16.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=17, we need to be on y=7 at t=16 or at t=17 with S, but y_17=8, so must come from y=7 at t=16 with U.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at t=18; the earliest possible is t=19 with y=9.\n\nThus minimal H is 10, with y_{10+10-1}=y_{19}=9.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=19-1? t=10 to t=10+H-1=10+10-1=19.\n\nActions at t=10 to t=18 for 9 actions? H=10 actions: t=10 to t=19, but t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nH=10, so actions at t=10 to t=10+10-1=19.\n\nt=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nThen at turn t=10+10-1=19, y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, we need to specify the actions.\n\nFrom the earlier sequence with a stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=10: action U, to y11=2\n\nt=11: U, y12=3\n\nt=12: U, y13=4\n\nt=13: U, y14=5\n\nt=14: U, y15=6  (now at t=15, y=6)\n\nt=15: action S, so y16=6  (stay at y=6 for t=16)\n\nt=16: action U, y17=7\n\nt=17: action U, y18=8\n\nt=18: action U, y19=9\n\nNow, we have actions up to t=18, but for H=10, we need actions up to t=19? Actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\nt=19 action is needed for y20, but we don't care, since we reach at t=19.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until the position is reached.\n\nBut in this case, with actions at t=10 to t=18, we have y19=9 at t=19.\n\nBut for H=10, we have one more action.\n\nPerhaps at t=19, we can do S or something, but not necessary.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H=10, actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, if we take action, it affects y20, but since we already reached at t=19, we can take any action, but the position at t=19 is already 9, so we can take S, for example.\n\nBut in the collision, we need to check until t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, y=9, no collision.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: S\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nNow, we need one more action for t=19? H=10 actions: t=10 to t=19.\n\nt=19: we can take S, for example.\n\ny20 = y19 + Δy19 =9 +0=9, but not needed.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions from t=10 to t=19, but the position is reached at t=19.\n\nTo save an action, but we need H=10.\n\nAnother sequence: we can reach earlier if we go down, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but it takes extra down and up.\n\nFor instance, at some point go down to y=0, then up.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=0, then to y=1, etc., takes two turns for no progress, so worse.\n\nSo the stay is better.\n\nWith H=10, we have the sequence above with 9 actions listed, but we need 10 actions.\n\nActions at t=10 to t=19: 10 actions.\n\nIn my sequence, I have t=10 to t=18: 9 actions, missing t=19.\n\nSo for t=19, we add an action, say S.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{10} = U  (since t1=10)\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turn t.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S  (or U, but y=9, if U, y20=10, but y=10 invalid, since y<=9, so cannot U, must S or D, but D to 8, not good, so S.\n\ny between 0 and 9, so at y=9, can S or D, but D not useful, so S.\n\nIn the sequence, we only care until we reach, but we have to specify the actions for H turns.\n\nNow, in this case, at t=19, we take S, and position at t=19 is y=9, which is fine.\n\nBut we can avoid the extra action if we reach at t=19 with the actions up to t=18.\n\nBut for H=10, we need 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps another sequence with different timing.\n\nFor example, go up faster initially.\n\nBut we start at y=1.\n\nOr, at t=14, instead of going to y=6, stay at y=5.\n\nThen:\n\nt=10: U, y11=2\n\nt=11: U, y12=3\n\nt=12: U, y13=4\n\nt=13: U, y14=5\n\nt=14: S, so y15=5  (at t=15, y=5)\n\nt=15: U, y16=6\n\nt=16: U, y17=7\n\nt=17: U, y18=8\n\nt=18: U, y19=9\n\nThen actions from t=10 to t=18: 9 actions.\n\nStill 9.\n\nWith H=10, add t=19 S.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=16, y=6, safe; t=17, y=7, safe; etc.\n\nBut we have an extra action.\n\nTo have exactly the actions needed.\n\nSince we have to take 10 actions to reach at t=19, it's fine.\n\nBut in the first sequence with stay at t=15, we have the same.\n\nNow, about the cars: in freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we only care about x=0.\n\nIn the sequence, we avoided the dangerous times.\n\nAnother way: since y=7 is safe at t=14, I could be on y=7 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, y=7, safe, I can go U to y=8 at t=15, but t=15 y=8 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr, at t=14, y=7, stay, but then at t=15, y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo down to y=6 at t=15, but from y=7 to y=6.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nThe sequence with a stay at t=15 is fine.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we handled the critical one.\n\nAlso, for freeway 6, it is always safe, etc.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S  (stay to avoid moving to y=7 at t=16)\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S  (since we need 10th action)\n\nBut at turn 19, we are already at y=9, and we take S, which is fine.\n\nTo make it cleaner, we could have the stay at another point, but it's similar.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 19, we must specify an action, and S is safe.\n\nNow, about the format.\n\nAlso, in the car list, freeway 7 and 8 have three cars, but we only cared about the one that covers x=0 at t=15,16.\n\nOthers don't affect.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut for H=10, actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\nPosition at t=19 is y=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nt1=10.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\n}\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? H=10 is minimal since we cannot reach at t=18.\n\nPerhaps with down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=0 at some point, but that requires down and then up, net zero, so takes two extra actions to go down and up, worse than staying.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe at t=14, I could be on y=8 at t=14.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=14.\n\ny_10=1, to y_14=8, in 4 steps: y_14 =1 + sum_{k=10 to13} Δy_k, need sum=7, but only 4 deltas, each <=1, max y_14=1+4=5, cannot reach y=8 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be at high y is later.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, the sequence above is fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 10, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) during turns \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\) for freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are always safe for \\(x = 0\\) at all turns, as the car spans never cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at turns \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\) due to the car with initial span \\([-41, -30]\\) at \\(t = 10\\) (moving right at speed 6), which covers \\(x = 0\\) at these turns. It is safe at other turns (e.g., \\(t = 14\\) and \\(t = 17\\)).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is similarly unsafe at turns \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\) due to the same car configuration and safe at other turns.\n- Freeway \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is always safe.\n- The player cannot be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 15\\) or \\(t = 16\\) to avoid collision.\n\n### Sequence Justification:\n- The sequence starts with up actions (U) to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 6 by turn \\(t = 15\\):\n  - \\(t = 10\\): \\(y = 1\\) → action U → \\(y_{11} = 2\\)\n  - \\(t = 11\\): \\(y = 2\\) → action U → \\(y_{12} = 3\\)\n  - \\(t = 12\\): \\(y = 3\\) → action U → \\(y_{13} = 4\\)\n  - \\(t = 13\\): \\(y = 4\\) → action U → \\(y_{14} = 5\\)\n  - \\(t = 14\\): \\(y = 5\\) → action U → \\(y_{15} = 6\\)\n- At \\(t = 15\\), \\(y = 6\\) (safe), and action S (stay) is taken to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 16\\), resulting in \\(y_{16} = 6\\).\n- At \\(t = 16\\), \\(y = 6\\) (safe), and action U is taken to move to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 17\\).\n- At \\(t = 17\\), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (since \\(t = 17 > 16\\)), and action U is taken to reach \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 18\\).\n- At \\(t = 18\\), \\(y = 8\\) is safe (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(t = 18\\)), and action U is taken to reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 19\\).\n- At \\(t = 19\\), \\(y = 9\\) (target reached). Action S is taken at \\(t = 19\\) as a placeholder since the position is already at \\(y = 9\\), and it does not affect the outcome.\n\n### Collision Checks:\n- \\(t = 10\\): \\(y = 1\\), safe (car span \\([37, 48]\\) does not cover \\(0\\)).\n- \\(t = 11\\): \\(y = 2\\), safe (car span \\([7, 18]\\) does not cover \\(0\\)).\n- \\(t = 12\\): \\(y = 3\\), safe (car span \\([13, 24]\\) does not cover \\(0\\)).\n- \\(t = 13\\): \\(y = 4\\), safe (car span \\([19, 30]\\) does not cover \\(0\\)).\n- \\(t = 14\\): \\(y = 5\\), safe (car span \\([25, 36]\\) does not cover \\(0\\)).\n- \\(t = 15\\): \\(y = 6\\), safe (car span \\([31, 42]\\) does not cover \\(0\\)).\n- \\(t = 16\\): \\(y = 6\\), safe (same as above).\n- \\(t = 17\\): \\(y = 7\\), safe (car span \\([1, 12]\\) does not cover \\(0\\) at \\(t = 17\\)).\n- \\(t = 18\\): \\(y = 8\\), safe (car span \\([7, 18]\\) does not cover \\(0\\) at \\(t = 18\\)).\n- \\(t = 19\\): \\(y = 9\\), safe (no cars).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{19} = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 19\\) (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 10 - 1 = 19\\)) with \\(H = 10\\) turns, avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 on that freeway at the same turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn. The current turn is t1 = 12. I need to find positions for turns after this.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their movements. Since the collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at time T, I need to find for each freeway and each turn if there's a car covering position 0.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8. Freeway 1 has one car, freeways 2 to 6 each have one car, but freeways 7 and 8 each have three cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=12. Since it's right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: initial span [τ, h] at t1, then at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right, so right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: (24,13,right,6) — head and tail, since direction right, head should be the larger number? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h? But here for freeway 2, h=24, τ=13, so τ=13, h=24, so [13,24] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 to 6 same: (24,13,right,6) each, so all have the same car? Probably different freeways, but same parameters.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 each have three cars: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, and all have direction right. No left-moving cars.\n\nAlso, speeds: freeway 1 has speed 12, others have speed 6.\n\nNow, t1=12.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each turn T when a car covers position 0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time T, collision if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nSo for each car, I need to solve when τ + s(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t1) for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all are right-moving, let's set Δt = T - t1 = T - 12\n\nThen for a car with τ, h, s, at time T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n0 <= h + s Δt and τ + s Δt <= 0\n\nSince τ <= h, we have:\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s Δt: s Δt >= -h\n\nFrom τ + s Δt <= 0: s Δt <= -τ\n\nSo -h <= s Δt <= -τ\n\nThus Δt must satisfy ceil( (-h)/s ) <= Δt <= floor( (-τ)/s ) ? Let's see.\n\ns Δt >= -h ⇒ Δt >= ceil( -h / s )\n\ns Δt <= -τ ⇒ Δt <= floor( -τ / s )\n\nAnd since Δt integer, we can find integer Δt in that range.\n\nThen for each car, we can find the turns when it covers 0.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so we need when any car covers 0.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, τ=-59, h=-48, s=12, right-moving.\n\nΔt = T - 12\n\ns Δt >= -h ⇒ 12 Δt >= -(-48) = 48 ⇒ 12 Δt >= 48 ⇒ Δt >= 4\n\ns Δt <= -τ ⇒ 12 Δt <= -(-59) = 59 ⇒ 12 Δt <= 59 ⇒ Δt <= 59/12 = 4.916..., so Δt <= 4 since floor? 59/12=4.916, floor is 4? But Δt <= floor(59/12)? Let's compute.\n\ns Δt <= -τ, -τ = -(-59) =59, so 12 Δt <= 59, Δt <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt <= 4 since Δt integer? But Δt <= floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4\n\nAnd Δt >= ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\ns Δt >= -h =48, 12 Δt >=48, Δt >=4\n\ns Δt <= -τ =59, 12 Δt <=59, Δt <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so Δt <=4 since integer.\n\nThus Δt >=4 and Δt <=4, so Δt=4\n\nSo only at Δt=4, T= t1 +4 =12+4=16\n\nAt T=16, car on freeway 1 covers 0.\n\nFor other times, no collision on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, τ=13, h=24, s=6, right-moving.\n\ns Δt >= -h ⇒ 6 Δt >= -24 ⇒ Δt >= -4\n\nBut Δt >=0 since T>=t1, so always true? Δt is from 0,1,2,... so Δt >=0, -4 is less, so s Δt >= -24 always true for Δt>=0.\n\ns Δt <= -τ ⇒ 6 Δt <= -13 ⇒ Δt <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so Δt <= -3? But Δt >=0, so no solution? Let's see.\n\n0 in span: τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nτ=13, s=6, h=24\n\n13 + 6 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 24 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 13 + 6 Δt <= 0 ⇒ 6 Δt <= -13 ⇒ Δt <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, since Δt >=0, impossible.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 24 + 6 Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nSo no Δt satisfies both, meaning this car never covers 0 for T>=t1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3,4,5,6: all same as freeway 2, since same parameters. So no car covers 0 on freeways 2,3,4,5,6 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6) same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6) τ=49? Head h=60, tail τ=49, so [49,60] at t1.\n\ns=6\n\n0 in span: 49 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 60 + 6 Δt\n\n49 + 6 Δt <= 0 ⇒ 6 Δt <= -49 ⇒ Δt <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, impossible for Δt>=0\n\n0 <= 60 + 6 Δt always true.\n\nSo never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-18,-29,right,6) head h=-18, tail τ=-29\n\nSo [τ, h] = [-29, -18] at t1\n\ns=6\n\n0 in span: -29 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -18 + 6 Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-29 + 6 Δt <= 0 ⇒ 6 Δt <= 29 ⇒ Δt <= 29/6 ≈ 4.833, so Δt <= 4\n\nAnd 0 <= -18 + 6 Δt ⇒ 6 Δt >= 18 ⇒ Δt >= 3\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=4\n\nThus Δt=3 or 4\n\nT = t1 + Δt =12 +3=15 or 12+4=16\n\nNow for freeway 7, we have multiple cars, but first two never cover 0, third covers at T=15 and 16.\n\nSo on freeway 7, collision at T=15 and T=16.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8, same cars as freeway 7: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst car: never covers 0\n\nSecond car: never covers 0\n\nThird car: same as above, covers at T=15 and T=16\n\nSo on freeway 8, collision at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow, freeway 1 has collision only at T=16.\n\nFreeways 2-6 no collision ever.\n\nFreeway 7 collision at T=15,16\n\nFreeway 8 collision at T=15,16\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9, moving up or down or stay.\n\nEach turn, I can go U (up +1), D (down -1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny from 0 to 9, inclusive, I assume, and at position (0,y), so when I reach (0,9), I stop.\n\nStart at turn t1=12, position y=3.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I start at y=3, need to go up to 9, so at least 6 steps if I go up every time, but I might need to avoid collisions, so I might need to stay or go down sometimes, but going down would increase time, so probably not, unless necessary to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, the collisions are only on certain freeways at certain times.\n\nThe collisions happen only when I am on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSpecifically, if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and at that turn, there is a car covering 0 on that freeway, then collision.\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nI start at y=3 at T=12.\n\nFreeway y=3 is freeway 3, which has no collision ever, as we saw, since freeway 3 has a car that never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2,4,5,6 no collision.\n\nFreeway 1 collision at T=16 only.\n\nFreeway 7 collision at T=15 and 16.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at T=15 and 16.\n\nFreeway 9: but I need to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=9 is the top, no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is bottom, no cars? But I start from y=3, going to y=9, so y=0 might not be visited.\n\nNow, the path: I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up, but I need to check when I pass through each freeway.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, except when staying.\n\nBut staying might be used to avoid being on a bad freeway at a bad time.\n\nThe collisions are only at specific times: T=15 and T=16 for freeways 7 and 8, and T=16 for freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1.\n\nFreeway 7 is y=7, freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nI start at y=3 at T=12.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 6, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut let's simulate going straight up.\n\nAt T=12, y=3, action? I need to choose action for each turn.\n\nTurn t: at the beginning of turn t, I am at position y_t, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I collide if at that turn, there is a car covering 0 on freeway y_t.\n\nThe collision occurs at turn T only if I am on y_T and 0 in span for that freeway at T.\n\nAlso, note that if I move to a different y, I am not on the new freeway until the next turn? Let's see the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, since I am on y_T at turn T, I care about the car on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, so collision depends on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so collision depends on that freeway at T+1.\n\nIn the note, it says if I move to different y at turn T, I am not on the new one at turn T, which is consistent.\n\nNow, back to direct path.\n\nStart: T=12, y=3. Freeway 3, no collision at T=12, since no car covers 0 ever.\n\nAction: suppose I go U, so y=4 at T=13.\n\nT=13, y=4. Freeway 4, no collision ever.\n\nGo U, y=5 at T=14.\n\nT=14, y=5. Freeway 5, no collision.\n\nGo U, y=6 at T=15.\n\nT=15, y=6. Freeway 6, no collision ever, so safe.\n\nGo U, y=7 at T=16.\n\nT=16, y=7. Freeway 7, at T=16, we have collision, since car covers 0. Specifically, the third car on freeway 7 covers 0 at T=16.\n\nSo at T=16, if I am on y=7, I collide.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=16, I am on y=7, which has collision, so I die.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I go to y=7 earlier or later.\n\nIn above, at T=15 I was on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=16, I go to y=7, but T=16 is bad for y=7.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or go down to avoid being on y=7 at T=16.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if I go up every time, I reach y=9 at T=18? Let's see.\n\nT=12: y=3\n\nAfter action, at T=13: if U, y=4\n\nT=14: y=5\n\nT=15: y=6\n\nT=16: y=7 — but here collision if on y=7 at T=16.\n\nThen T=17: y=8\n\nT=18: y=9\n\nBut at T=16, on y=7, collision.\n\nTo avoid, I need not to be on y=7 at T=16, or not on y=8 at T=15 or 16 if bad, but y=8 is bad at T=15 and 16.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 is bad only at T=16.\n\nBut I am at y=3 to start, going up.\n\nAnother idea: go slower or faster.\n\nFor example, at some point, stay to delay.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are bad at T=15 and 16, I should not be on them at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 bad at T=16.\n\nBut y=1 is below, I am going up, so probably not issue.\n\nNow, the critical turns are T=15 and 16 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nI need to be on y=7 only when not T=15 or 16, but since I move step by step, I have to pass through each y.\n\nThe times when I can be on y=7 safely.\n\nSince freeway 7 has collision only at T=15 and 16, so safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, I start at T=12, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe distance is 6, so minimal 6 actions to go up, arriving at T=18 at y=9.\n\nBut at T=16, if I am at y=7, it is bad.\n\nIn the sequence above, I arrive at y=7 at T=16.\n\nTo avoid, I could arrive at y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if I go up faster? But I can only go up one per turn, so I can't go faster.\n\nSlower: by staying or going down.\n\nBut going down would make it take longer.\n\nFor instance, at T=12, instead of going up, I stay or go down, but that seems worse.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 before T=15 or after T=16.\n\nT=15 is bad, T=16 bad.\n\nSo safe times for y=7 are T<=14 or T>=17.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, safe times T<=14 or T>=17.\n\nNow, I am at y=3 at T=12.\n\nIf I go directly up:\n\nT=12: y=3\n\nT=13: y=4\n\nT=14: y=5\n\nT=15: y=6 — safe, since y=6 no issue\n\nT=16: I need to go to y=7, but bad, or stay at y=6, or go down.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 at T=16, then y=6, freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\nThen at T=17, I can go to y=7.\n\nNow T=17, y=7: freeway 7, at T=17, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 7 at T=17: Δt = T-12 =17-12=5\n\nFor the third car: -29 + 6*5 = -29 + 30 =1, h + s Δt = -18 + 30=12? Span: τ + s Δt = -29 + 30 =1, h + s Δt = -18 + 30=12, so [1,12] at T=17, 0 not in [1,12], so no cover.\n\nSimilarly, other cars don't cover 0, so safe.\n\nThen at T=17, I am at y=7, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=8 at T=18.\n\nT=18, y=8: freeway 8, at T=18.\n\nΔt=18-12=6\n\nFor third car: τ + s Δt = -29 + 6*6 = -29 + 36 =7, h + s Δt = -18 + 36=18, so [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nOther cars no cover, so safe.\n\nThen at T=19, go to y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, so no issue, and I reach (0,9).\n\nBut at which turn? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart T=12, y=3\n\nAction a_{12}: say U, then T=13, y=4\n\na_{13}: U, T=14, y=5\n\na_{14}: U, T=15, y=6\n\na_{15}: S (stay), so at T=16, still y=6 (since action at T=15 determines y for T=16? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nThe state: at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and collision checked based on y_t and cars at turn t.\n\nFor example, at turn T=12, we are at y_12=3, and we check collision for freeway 3 at T=12, which is safe.\n\nThen we choose action a_12, which sets y_13.\n\nThen at turn T=13, we are at y_13, check collision for that freeway at T=13, and so on.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=12: y=3, safe, choose action. To go up, choose U, so y_{13} = y_12 +1 =4\n\nT=13: now at y=4, freeway 4, at T=13, safe. Choose U, y_{14}=5\n\nT=14: at y=5, freeway 5, safe. Choose U, y_{15}=6\n\nT=15: at y=6, freeway 6, safe. Now, if I choose U, then y_{16}=7, but at T=16, I will be at y=7, which has collision at T=16.\n\nBut I can choose S at T=15, so y_{16} = y_{15} =6 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nThen T=16: at y=6, freeway 6, safe (no collision ever). Then I choose U, so y_{17}=7\n\nT=17: at y=7, freeway 7, at T=17, as we computed, no car covers 0, safe. Choose U, y_{18}=8\n\nT=18: at y=8, freeway 8, at T=18, no car covers 0 (as above), safe. Then choose U, y_{19}=9\n\nT=19: now at y=9, which is the target, and since not a freeway, no collision, so I have reached (0,9) at turn T=19.\n\nBut when do I reach? At T=19, I am at (0,9), so I have arrived.\n\nThe number of turns: from T=12 to T=19, that's 7 turns? Turns: T=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19: that's 8 turns, but actions from t=12 to t=18, 7 actions.\n\nStart at t1=12, position given.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence above: actions at t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18: that's 7 actions.\n\nAfter a_t for t=12 to 18, at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1? Let's see the question.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nIt says: determine H and actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence: if I start at turn t1=12, after H actions, at turn 12+H.\n\nI want to reach at turn 12+H with y=9.\n\nIn my sequence: actions at t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18: that's t=12 to 18, which is 7 actions, so H=7, and at turn 12+7=19, y=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from y=3 to y=9, delta y=6, so at least 6 actions if all up.\n\nBut with the collision, I might not be able to do in 6.\n\nWith 6 actions: actions at t=12,13,14,15,16,17.\n\nThen at turn 12+6=18, y=?\n\nStart y=3\n\nAfter a12: U, y13=4\n\na13: U, y14=5\n\na14: U, y15=6\n\na15: U, y16=7\n\na16: U, y17=8\n\na17: U, y18=9\n\nBut at T=16, when I am at y=7, collision? In this sequence, at turn T=16, I am at y=7, which has collision, so I die at T=16, before I can take action at T=16.\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\n- Turn T=12: at y=3, safe\n\nAction a12=U, so y13=4\n\n- Turn T=13: at y=4, safe\n\nAction a13=U, y14=5\n\n- Turn T=14: at y=5, safe\n\nAction a14=U, y15=6\n\n- Turn T=15: at y=6, safe\n\nAction a15=U, so y16=7\n\n- Turn T=16: at y=7, now check collision: freeway 7 at T=16, car covers 0, so collision, game over.\n\nI never reach T=17 or y=9.\n\nSo indeed, with 6 actions, if I go straight, I collide at T=16.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=15 or T=16.\n\nIn the 6-action sequence, I am on y=7 at T=16, bad.\n\nCan I be on y=7 at a different time?\n\nFor example, if I go slower.\n\nBut with 6 actions, I must go up 6 times to reach y=9 from y=3.\n\nIf I do any S or D, I don't reach y=9 in 6 actions.\n\nSo minimal actions to reach is 6, but in 6 actions, I end up on y=7 at T=16 or something.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U, I am at y=7 at T=16.\n\nT=16 is bad.\n\nIf I start by staying or going down, but that would make it worse, take more actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? But I can't, since min 6 steps.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=7 before T=15.\n\nFor example, at T=12, y=3\n\nIf I could go up faster, but I can't.\n\nAt T=12, go U to y=4 at T=13\n\nBut T=13 is early, y=4.\n\nTo be at y=7 earlier, say at T=14 or something.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=12, to be at y=7 at T=14.\n\nThen actions: T=12: U, y13=4\n\nT=13: U, y14=5? Not y=7.\n\nImpossible to be at y=7 at T=14 from y=3 at T=12 with two actions: max y=5.\n\nSimilarly, earliest I can be at y=7 is T=15: from y=3, after 4 actions U: T=12 to T=16 position.\n\nAt T=12: y=3\n\nAfter a12 U: y13=4\n\nAfter a13 U: y14=5\n\nAfter a14 U: y15=6\n\nAfter a15 U: y16=7\n\nSo I am at y=7 at T=16, which is bad.\n\nIf I go up slower, I arrive later.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=17 or later.\n\nIn the 6-action sequence, I must be at y=7 at some point.\n\nSince I start at y=3, after k actions, y = 3 + number of U minus number of D, plus initial.\n\nBut since I need y=9, net +6 U, so in H actions, if I have U_u times, D_d times, S_s times, then u + d + s = H, and y_final = 3 + u - d.\n\nSet to 9, so u - d =6.\n\nThus u =6 + d.\n\nSince d >=0, u >=6, and s = H - u - d = H - (6+d) - d = H -6 -2d.\n\nNow, time: at turn T=12 + t, for t=0 to H-1 actions.\n\nThe position at each turn depends on the actions.\n\nBut to avoid collision, I need not to be on y=7 at T=15 or T=16, not on y=8 at T=15 or T=16.\n\nSimilarly for y=1, but y=1 is not on path probably.\n\nWith H=6, u=6 + d, d>=0.\n\nIf d=0, u=6, s=0, then as before, y: T=12:3, T=13:4, T=14:5, T=15:6, T=16:7, T=17:8, and at T=17: y=8, but at T=17, freeway 8, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8 at T=17: earlier we said for y=8, safe at T=17.\n\nΔt=17-12=5, τ + s Δt for third car: -29 + 6*5 = -29+30=1, h + s Δt = -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut at T=16, I am at y=7, which is bad.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=16, y=7, collision.\n\nIf I have d>0, say d=1, then u=7, s= H-6-2d, H=6, s=6-6-2(1)= -2? H=6, u=6+d, d=1, u=7, but H=6 actions, u + d + s =6, u=7, d=1, s= -2 impossible.\n\nH=6, u + d + s =6.\n\nu - d =6.\n\nAdd: 2u + s =12, subtract: 2d + s =0.\n\nSince s >=0, d>=0, so 2d + s =0 implies d=0, s=0, u=6.\n\nThus with H=6, only possible all U, no S or D.\n\nAnd that causes collision at T=16 on y=7.\n\nTherefore, impossible in 6 actions.\n\nMinimal H must be at least 7.\n\nNow with H=7, possible as I had earlier: with one stay.\n\nFor example: actions: U,U,U,S,U,U,U\n\nThen:\n\nT=12: y=3, safe, action U\n\nT=13: y=4, safe, action U\n\nT=14: y=5, safe, action U\n\nT=15: y=6, safe, action S (stay)\n\nThen T=16: y=6 (since stayed), safe, action U\n\nT=17: y=7, safe (T=17), action U\n\nT=18: y=8, safe (T=18), action U\n\nThen at T=19: y=9, reached.\n\nActions at t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18: seven actions, H=7.\n\nAt T=19, position (0,9).\n\nCan I reach in 7 actions but with different sequence?\n\nFor example, instead of staying at y=6, I could stay earlier or later.\n\nBut this seems fine.\n\nI could go down and up, but that would take more actions or same.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point I go down to avoid, but unnecessary.\n\nAnother possibility: since y=8 is also bad at T=15 and 16, but in this sequence, I am on y=8 at T=18, which is fine.\n\nTo be on y=7 at T=17, y=8 at T=18, both safe.\n\nCould I be on y=7 earlier? But earliest T=16, which is bad, so I have to be at T=17 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, with H=7, it works.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=7 where I reach earlier? But T=19 is the arrival turn.\n\nWith H=7 actions, arrival at T=12+7=19.\n\nSince H=7 is minimal, as H=6 impossible.\n\nIn the sequence, I used one S, so I have u=6 U, one S, d=0.\n\ny from 3, after 6U, to 9, with one S in between.\n\nIn this case, I stayed at y=6 for one extra turn.\n\nCould I stay at another y?\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=5, then stay, etc.\n\nBut might not be better.\n\nSuppose at T=12, I stay: but then I waste a turn, y=3 at T=13, then I need to go to y=9, which might take more actions.\n\nFor example, if I stay at T=12: action S, then T=13 y=3, then U to T=14 y=4, etc., but I will be later, say at T=20 or something, worse.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems optimal.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at t=12 to t=18:\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: S (stay at y=6)\n\nt=16: U (to y=7)\n\nt=17: U (to y=8)\n\nt=18: U (to y=9)\n\nThen at T=19, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are for t=12 to t=18.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt1=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7 but different actions?\n\nFor example, could I avoid staying by going to another freeway?\n\nBut all freeways between 1 and 8 have cars, but only specific times bad.\n\ny=2 to y=6 are always safe, so I can stay there if needed.\n\nBut in this case, I stayed at y=6.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=7 at a safe time, but earliest safe is T=17.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at T=17, I need to be on y=6 at T=16 or T=17 with action.\n\nFor example, if at T=16 I am at y=6, then U to y=7 at T=17.\n\nIf at T=16 I am at y=7, but T=16 is bad.\n\nSo to be at y=7 at T=17, I must be at y=6 or y=7 at T=16.\n\nIf at y=7 at T=16, bad, so must be at y=6 at T=16, then action U to be at y=7 at T=17.\n\nSimilarly for later.\n\nIn the sequence, I have that.\n\nAnother thing: what about y=8? I need to be on y=8 at some point to go to y=9.\n\ny=8 is safe except T=15 and T=16.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=8 at T=18, which is safe.\n\nIf I were on y=8 at T=17, but T=17 is safe for y=8.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=17 I am at y=7, then U to y=8 at T=18.\n\nCould I be at y=8 at T=17?\n\nFor that, I need to be at y=7 at T=16 or T=17.\n\nBut at T=16, y=7 bad, so I must be at y=7 at T=17? To be at y=8 at T=17, I need to be at y=7 at T=16 and action U, but at T=16 y=7 bad.\n\nAction: at turn T, at position y_t, choose a_t, set y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_{t+1} =8, I need to be at y_t=7 or 8 or 9, but since moving, usually from 7 with U.\n\nSpecifically, if at T, y_t=7, choose U, then y_{t+1}=8.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y=8.\n\nSo to be at y=8 at turn S, I need that at turn S-1, I was at y=7 and chose U, or at y=8 and chose S, etc.\n\nBut in any case, if I want to be at y=8 at T=17, then I must have been at y=7 at T=16 and chosen U, but at T=16, if I am at y=7, collision, so I cannot choose action at T=16; I die before.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=8 at T=17, because to get there, I must have been at y=7 at T=16, which is fatal.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be at y=8 at T=16, obviously.\n\nSo the only safe times to be at y=8 are T<=14 or T>=17, but T<=14: at T=14, to be at y=8, I need to have come from below, but at T=12 I am at y=3, impossible to be at y=8 by T=14.\n\nEarliest to be at y=8 is T=16: from y=3, after 4U: T=12:3, T=13:4, T=14:5, T=15:6, T=16:7, then with U at T=16, y17=8, so at T=17, y=8.\n\nBut at T=16, I am at y=7, which is bad, so I cannot reach y=8 at T=17 because I die at T=16.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be at y=8 is T=18: as in my sequence, from y=7 at T=17, U to y=8 at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, earliest safe is T=17.\n\nThus, in the minimal path, I must be at y=7 at T=17 or later, y=8 at T=18 or later.\n\nIn my sequence, I am at y=7 at T=17, y=8 at T=18.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=19.\n\nWith H=7 actions.\n\nCould I reach y=9 earlier? Only if I can be at y=8 earlier, but I can't, as above.\n\nThus H=7 is minimal.\n\nIn the actions, I have one S at T=15.\n\nI could have the stay earlier, but it might not help to reduce H.\n\nFor example, if I stay at T=12, then I start later, take more turns.\n\nOr stay at T=13, similar.\n\nSo staying at T=15 is fine.\n\nAnother thing: what about freeway 1? But I never go to y=1, so no issue.\n\nIn the beginning, I thought freeway 1 has collision at T=16, but since I am not on y=1, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, only y=7 and y=8 at T=15,16 are problems.\n\nIn my sequence, I avoided y=7 and y=8 at critical times.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nH=7, actions for t=12 to t=18.\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: S\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nAt turn 12: position y=3, safe. Action U, so y=4 for turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: y=4, freeway 4, safe. Action U, y=5 for turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: y=5, freeway 5, safe. Action U, y=6 for turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: y=6, freeway 6, safe. Action S, so y=6 for turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: y=6, freeway 6, safe (no car ever at 0). Action U, so y=7 for turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: y=7, freeway 7, at T=17. As computed, Δt=5, cars: first car (24,13) span [13+30,24+30]=[43,54]? At T=17, Δt=5, s=6.\n\nCar1: τ=13 + 6*5=13+30=43, h=24+30=54, [43,54], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: τ=49+30=79, h=60+30=90, [79,90], no.\n\nCar3: τ=-29 +30=1, h=-18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in. So no collision, safe.\n\nAction U, so y=8 for turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: y=8, freeway 8, at T=18. Δt=6, s=6.\n\nCar1: τ=13+36=49, h=24+36=60, [49,60], no 0.\n\nCar2: τ=49+36=85, h=60+36=96, [85,96], no.\n\nCar3: τ=-29+36=7, h=-18+36=18, [7,18], no 0. Safe.\n\nAction U, so y=9 for turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, position (0,9), reached.\n\nPerfect.\n\nIs there a sequence without staying? But with H=7, I have to have one S or extra move, but since u must be 6, d=0, s=1, so one stay necessary.\n\nIf I go down and up, but that would require more actions or same with extra moves, but not better.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=15, instead of S, I go down to y=5, then later up, but then I need two extra moves to compensate, so H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nThus, minimal H=7 with the above sequence.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we considered all.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, but not relevant.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nNow, output.\n\nThe sequence is for t=12 to t=18, actions U,U,U,S,U,U,U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t1=12.\n\nAlso, H=7, but in the box, I think only the actions, since it says \"determine H and a sequence\", but in the box format, it shows the actions.\n\nIn the user message: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} ... }\" so I think just the actions, and H is implied.\n\nBut it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so perhaps I should state H.\n\nBut in the box, it only shows the actions.\n\nI think H is the number of actions, and the sequence shows it.\n\nIn the sequence, there are 7 actions, so H=7.\n\nIn the turn labels, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=12, H=7, so actions at 12 to 18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7, meaning the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H = 12 + 7 = 19\\) after executing the sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n- At turns 12 to 14, moving up through freeways 3, 4, and 5, which are always safe (no car covers position 0 at any turn).\n- At turn 15, staying at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6), which is safe (no car covers 0 at any turn).\n- At turn 16, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7) would cause a collision at turn 16, but staying at \\(y = 6\\) avoids this.\n- At turn 17, moving to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7) is safe because no car covers 0 at turn 17 (spans: [43,54], [79,90], [1,12], all exclude 0).\n- At turn 18, moving to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8) is safe because no car covers 0 at turn 18 (spans: [49,60], [85,96], [7,18], all exclude 0).\n- After the action at turn 18, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence is minimal because:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring a net increase of 6 in \\(y\\)-coordinate. With only \"up\" actions, 6 actions would suffice, but this leads to a collision at turn 16 on \\(y = 7\\).\n- With \\(H = 6\\) actions (all \"up\"), the player is at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 16, where freeway 7 has a car covering position 0 (span [ -29 + 6 \\times 4, -18 + 6 \\times 4 ] = [ -29 + 24, -18 + 24 ] = [-5, 6] at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\), which includes 0).\n- Any sequence with \\(H = 6\\) must use all \"up\" actions (since \\(u - d = 6\\) and \\(u + d + s = 6\\) imply \\(d = 0\\), \\(s = 0\\), \\(u = 6\\)), but this inevitably places the player on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 16, causing a collision.\n- Thus, \\(H = 7\\) is minimal, with one \"stay\" action to avoid the collision.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 14, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the freeway at the end of the turn) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: The player moves at the same time as the cars. The player's position at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,5). We choose an action (U, D, S) which will determine y_{t1+1} (i.e., after the action).\n\nThe update:\n- If we choose U, then y_{t1+1} = 5+1 = 6.\n- If we choose D, then y_{t1+1} = 5-1 = 4.\n- If we choose S, then y_{t1+1} = 5.\n\nBut note: at turn T, the player is at the freeway y_T (the position at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the collision condition says: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which we interpret as the freeway at the end of the turn, because the collision check is at the end of the turn) and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nHowever, note the note: if we move to a new freeway at turn T (meaning that at the end of the turn we are on a new freeway), then we are not considered to be on the new freeway until the next turn? Actually, the note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T. So at turn T, after the move, you are on y_{T} (the starting freeway) for the entire turn? \n\nBut wait, the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". This implies that at turn T, the player is still considered to be on the starting freeway (y_T) for the entire turn, and then at the next turn (T+1) they are on the new freeway.\n\nTherefore, the collision condition at turn T only matters for the freeway that the player is leaving (if moving) or staying on (if staying). \n\nSpecifically:\n- At turn T, the player is initially on freeway y_T (the freeway at the beginning of the turn).\n- After taking an action, the player moves to a new freeway (if U or D) or stays (if S). \n- However, for the entire turn T, the player is considered to be on the freeway y_T (the initial one) for collision purposes. So we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of some turn. So we require that at the end of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on every turn from t1 to the turn before we reach 9? Actually, we must avoid collisions at every turn we are in the game. Since we start at turn t1 and we end at turn t1+H-1, we have H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1, inclusive). At each of these turns, we are on some freeway (the one we started the turn on) and we must not collide with the car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states:\n\nWe are at turn 14. For each car, we are given its state at turn 14. We need to compute the span at any future turn T (>=14) for each car.\n\nNote: The freeways are from 1 to 8. We are starting at freeway 5 at turn 14.\n\nWe need to get to freeway 9. But note that the grid goes from y=0 to y=9. The freeways with cars are y=1 to 8. The player can be at y=0 and y=9 without having to worry about cars (since there are no cars on y=0 or y=9). However, the goal is (0,9) and we are safe at y=9.\n\nSo we need to move from y=5 to y=9, going through freeways 6,7,8 and then to 9. But note: when we are at a freeway, we are only vulnerable to the car on that freeway at the turn we are on.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (each action being U, D, or S) such that at each turn T (from 14 to 14+H-1) we are on a freeway that is safe (i.e., the car on that freeway at turn T does not have 0 in its span).\n\nImportant: The car spans are moving. We are given the state at turn 14.\n\nLet me denote:\n- For a car: (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 14.\n\nFor a left-moving car (which I assume is when direction is left? But the given data says \"right\" for all. So all cars are right-moving? Actually, in the table:\n\nAll cars are right-moving. So the update for a right-moving car at turn T (relative to turn 14, which is t0=14) is:\n   Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-14), head + s*(T-14)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table: for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12). \nFor a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the update rule says:\n   Right-moving: [Span(t1)= [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (-24, -35, right, 12). So which is head and which is tail? The table says: (head, tail, ...). \n\nAccording to the update rule for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So if the car is right-moving, then at t1, the tail is at tau and the head at h, and the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail to head (so tau <= h). \n\nBut in freeway 1: head=-24, tail=-35. That would imply that the span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]? But the update rule for right-moving says the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So if head=-24 and tail=-35, then tau=-35 and h=-24? Then the span is [-35, -24]. Then at turn T, the span becomes [ -35 + 12*(T-14), -24 + 12*(T-14) ].\n\nSimilarly, for the other cars.\n\nBut wait: the table for freeway 7 and 8 has multiple cars. So we have to consider all cars on that freeway. Collision occurs if 0 is in the span of ANY car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn T, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nLet me write down the car positions for each freeway at turn T (relative to turn 14, so let t = T - 14).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> at time T: [ -35 + 12*t, -24 + 12*t ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (36,25,right,6) -> note: head=36, tail=25? Then the span at t1=14 is [25,36]. Then at T: [25+6*t, 36+6*t]\n\nBut wait: the table says (head, tail) = (36,25). So if the car is right-moving, then the head is the front (which is the larger number) and tail is the back? Then the span is [tail, head] = [25,36]. That makes sense. So at T: [25+6*t, 36+6*t]\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5,6: same as freeway 2? Each has one car: (36,25,right,6) -> so same: [25+6*t, 36+6*t]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n   car1: (36,25,right,6) -> [25+6*t, 36+6*t]\n   car2: (-42,-53,right,6) -> head=-42, tail=-53 -> so span at t1: [-53, -42] -> at T: [-53+6*t, -42+6*t]\n   car3: (-6,-17,right,6) -> head=-6, tail=-17 -> span at t1: [-17,-6] -> at T: [-17+6*t, -6+6*t]\n\nFreeway 8: same three cars: \n   car1: (36,25,right,6) -> [25+6*t,36+6*t]\n   car2: (-42,-53,right,6) -> [-53+6*t, -42+6*t]\n   car3: (-6,-17,right,6) -> [-17+6*t, -6+6*t]\n\nWe are starting at turn 14 (t=0) at freeway 5. We want to go to freeway 9. We can move up (U) or down (D) or stay (S). We are constrained to y in [0,9]. \n\nWe need to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. Note that if we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision.\n\nBut note: we start at y=5 (freeway 5). We are at turn 14, so we must check freeway 5 at turn 14: is 0 in the span of any car on freeway 5? \n\nFreeway 5 has one car: [25+6*0, 36+6*0] = [25,36]. 0 is not in [25,36]. So safe.\n\nNow, we plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of moves would be 4 ups: U, U, U, U. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me simulate:\n\nTurn 14 (current): y=5 -> safe (as above).\n\nAction at turn 14: we choose an action that will lead to y_{15} (the next position). We want to go up, so let's try U.\n\nBut note: at turn 14, we are on freeway 5. After U, at the end of turn 14, we move to y=6. However, for the entire turn 14, we are considered to be on freeway 5. So we only check freeway 5 at turn 14 (which is safe). Then at turn 15, we start on freeway 6.\n\nNow, at turn 15 (t = 15-14 = 1): we are on freeway 6. We must check freeway 6 at turn 15.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: [25+6*1, 36+6*1] = [31,42]. 0 is not in [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen we can choose U again: then at the end of turn 15, we go to freeway 7.\n\nTurn 16 (t=2): we are on freeway 7. Check freeway 7 at turn 16 (t=2):\n\nCar1: [25+6*2, 36+6*2] = [37,48] -> safe (0 not in [37,48])\nCar2: [-53+6*2, -42+6*2] = [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41, -30] -> safe\nCar3: [-17+6*2, -6+6*2] = [-5, 6] -> note: 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes, because -5<=0<=6. So collision!\n\nTherefore, if we go to freeway 7 at turn 16 (which is when we start turn 16 on freeway 7), we collide.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway 7 at turn 16.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway 7 at turn 16.\n\nWhat if we delay the move to freeway 7? For example, at turn 14: we do S (stay) so that at turn 15 we are still at freeway 5. Then at turn 15 we move to freeway 6. Then at turn 16 we are at freeway 6? Then at turn 17 we move to freeway 7.\n\nBut then we need to check:\n\nTurn 14 (t0): freeway 5: safe (as above)\nTurn 14: action S -> so at turn 15 we are still at freeway 5? Actually, no: at the end of the action we stay at 5, so at the next turn (15) we start at freeway 5.\n\nThen turn 15 (t=1): freeway 5: [25+6*1, 36+6*1] = [31,42] -> safe.\nThen we do U at turn 15: so we move to freeway 6 at the end of turn 15. Then turn 16: we start at freeway 6.\n\nTurn 16 (t=2): freeway 6: [25+6*2, 36+6*2] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen we do U at turn 16: so we move to freeway 7 at the end of turn 16. Then turn 17: we start at freeway 7.\n\nNow, check freeway 7 at turn 17 (t=3):\n\nCar1: [25+6*3, 36+18] = [43,54] -> safe\nCar2: [-53+18, -42+18] = [-35, -24] -> safe\nCar3: [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo safe. Then we can do U at turn 17 to go to freeway 8.\n\nTurn 18: we start at freeway 8. Check freeway 8 at turn 18 (t=4):\n\nFreeway 8 has the same cars as freeway 7? Actually, the table shows the same set of cars for freeway 7 and 8? But they are different freeways. The cars on freeway 8 at turn 18:\n\nCar1: [25+6*4, 36+24] = [49,60] -> safe\nCar2: [-53+24, -42+24] = [-29, -18] -> safe\nCar3: [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\nThen we do U at turn 18 to go to freeway 9.\n\nTurn 19: we start at freeway 9. There are no cars on freeway 9, so safe. And we are at y=9, so we are done.\n\nBut wait, we need to be at (0,9) at the end of turn 18? Actually, we are at the beginning of turn 19 at freeway 9. But the goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the end of the last turn. So we must have that at the end of turn 18, we are at y=9? \n\nHow does the movement work? We take an action at turn 18: if we do U at turn 18 from freeway 8, then we move to freeway 9 at the end of turn 18. So at the end of turn 18, we are at y=9. Then we don't need to do anything else. So the last action is at turn 18.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 14: S (so we stay at 5, but note we are safe at freeway 5 at turn 14)\nTurn 15: U (to 6)\nTurn 16: U (to 7) -> but wait, we were going to do U at turn 16? But in our adjusted plan we are at freeway 6 at turn 16 and we do U at turn 16 to go to 7 at the end of turn 16, so at turn 17 we start at 7.\n\nBut in the above, we did:\n\nTurn 14: S -> at the end of turn 14, we are still at 5. So turn 15: start at 5.\nTurn 15: U -> at the end of turn 15, we are at 6. So turn 16: start at 6.\nTurn 16: U -> at the end of turn 16, we are at 7. So turn 17: start at 7.\nTurn 17: U -> at the end of turn 17, we are at 8. So turn 18: start at 8.\nTurn 18: U -> at the end of turn 18, we are at 9.\n\nBut in the above, we said at turn 17 (when we start at 7) we check freeway 7 at turn 17 (t=3) and it's safe. Then at turn 18 we start at 8 and check freeway 8 at turn 18 (t=4) and it's safe.\n\nSo the sequence of actions from turn 14 to turn 18: 5 actions? But we only need 4 moves: from 5 to 9. However, we did one extra stay at the beginning.\n\nTotal turns: from turn 14 to turn 18 (inclusive) we have 5 turns? Actually, the turns are:\n\nAt turn 14: we take an action (S) -> then we are at the end of turn 14 at y=5.\nAt turn 15: we take an action (U) -> at the end of turn 15 at y=6.\nAt turn 16: U -> end at y=7.\nAt turn 17: U -> end at y=8.\nAt turn 18: U -> end at y=9.\n\nSo we have 5 actions: for turns 14,15,16,17,18. Then H=5.\n\nBut we could try to see if we can do it in 4 actions.\n\nAlternative: without the initial stay.\n\nAt turn 14: U -> then at the end of turn 14, we are at y=6. Then at turn 15: we start at freeway 6.\n\nAt turn 15 (t=1): freeway 6: [25+6*1, 36+6*1] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen we can do U at turn 15: to go to freeway 7 at the end of turn 15. Then turn 16: start at freeway 7.\n\nAt turn 16 (t=2): freeway 7: \n   car1: [25+12, 36+12] = [37,48] -> safe\n   car2: [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41,-30] -> safe\n   car3: [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6] -> contains 0 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn 15.\n\nWhat if at turn 15 we do S? Then we stay at freeway 6 for turn 15? Then at the end of turn 15 we are still at 6. Then turn 16: start at 6.\n\nAt turn 16 (t=2): freeway 6: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 16: we do U to go to freeway 7 at the end of turn 16. Then turn 17: start at freeway 7.\n\nAt turn 17 (t=3): freeway 7: \n   car1: [25+18,36+18]=[43,54] -> safe\n   car2: [-53+18, -42+18]=[-35,-24] -> safe\n   car3: [-17+18, -6+18]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 17: U -> to freeway 8 at the end of turn 17. Then turn 18: start at freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 18 (t=4): freeway 8: \n   car1: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> safe\n   car2: [-53+24, -42+24]=[-29,-18] -> safe\n   car3: [-17+24, -6+24]=[7,18] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 18: U -> to freeway 9 at the end of turn 18.\n\nSo this sequence:\n\nTurn 14: U -> to 6 (safe because at turn 14 we were on freeway 5, and we check freeway 5 at turn 14: safe)\nTurn 15: S -> stay at 6 (then at turn 15 we are on freeway 6: [31,42] -> safe)\nTurn 16: U -> to 7 (then at turn 16 we are on freeway 6? Actually, no: at turn 16 we start at freeway 6 (because we ended turn 15 at 6) and then we move to 7 at the end of turn 16. But during turn 16 we are on freeway 6? And we check freeway 6 at turn 16: [37,48] -> safe. Then we are safe.\n\nThen turn 17: U -> to 8 (then during turn 17 we are on freeway 7: and we check at turn 17: safe as above)\nTurn 18: U -> to 9.\n\nSo this is 5 actions as well? \n\nBut wait: we did 5 actions: turn14,15,16,17,18.\n\nBut we started at 5 and ended at 9: that's 4 moves. However, we had one stay. \n\nIs there a way to do it in 4 actions? That would be 4 consecutive moves? But we saw that going up two times in a row (turn14: U to6, turn15: U to7) causes a collision at turn16? Actually, at turn15 we start at6 and then at the end of turn15 we move to7, so at turn16 we start at7 and then we check freeway7 at turn16 (which is unsafe). \n\nWhat if we do a down move? But that would take us away from 9.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to 6, then down? But that would not help.\n\nOr we could go up to 6, then up to 7 at a later time. But we already did that with an extra stay.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the stay by taking a different path? For example, go to 4? But that is away from 9.\n\nOr, we could go to 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9, but we have to skip the dangerous turn for freeway 7.\n\nThe dangerous turn for freeway 7 is when the third car has a span that covers 0. The third car on freeway7: [-17, -6] at turn14, and it moves right at 6 per turn. So the span at turn T: [-17+6*(T-14), -6+6*(T-14)]\n\nWe want 0 to be not in that interval. So we require either:\n   -17+6*(T-14) > 0   OR   -6+6*(T-14) < 0\n\nBut note: the interval is [a,b] = [ -17+6t, -6+6t] where t=T-14.\n\nWe avoid if 0 < a or b < 0.\n\nBut a = -17+6t, b = -6+6t.\n\n0 < a => 0 < -17+6t => 6t > 17 => t > 17/6 ≈ 2.83 -> so t>=3.\n\nb < 0 => -6+6t <0 => 6t<6 => t<1.\n\nSo the only safe t are t<1 or t>=3.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway8, the same car? Actually, freeway8 has the same set of cars? So the same condition: safe for t<1 or t>=3.\n\nBut note: we are going to freeway7 and freeway8 at different turns.\n\nIn our plan, we are going to freeway7 at turn T (so we start the turn on freeway7 at turn T, so we check at turn T). Similarly for freeway8.\n\nSo for freeway7, we must have T (the turn) such that t=T-14 is either <1 or >=3.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway8, same.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider the other cars on these freeways. The other cars are safe at all times? For freeway7, car1: [25+6t,36+6t] -> always positive and increasing, so 0 is never in it. Car2: [-53+6t, -42+6t] -> always negative for t in the near future? Because -42+6t<0 when t<7. So for t<7, car2 is negative. So the only problem is car3.\n\nSimilarly for freeway8.\n\nSo the constraint for freeway7 and freeway8 is only car3: we must avoid t=1,2 (because at t=1: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0] -> contains 0? Actually, 0 is the right endpoint? The span is [a,b] inclusive? The problem says \"0 in the span\", and if the span is [-11,0], then 0 is included. Similarly, t=2: [-5,6] includes 0. t=0: [-17,-6] -> no. t=3: [1,12] -> no.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway7 or freeway8 at turn14+1=15 and 14+2=16.\n\nSo we can be on freeway7 or freeway8 at turn14 (if we were there) or at turn17 and beyond.\n\nBut we are starting at freeway5 at turn14. So we cannot be on freeway7 or freeway8 until at least turn17.\n\nTherefore, we must wait until turn17 to be on freeway7.\n\nTo get to freeway7 at turn17, we must have taken 2 up moves to get from freeway5 to freeway7. But we can spread these moves.\n\nWe have two options:\n\nOption 1: \n   turn14: U -> to6 (then turn15: start at6)\n   turn15: we cannot go to7 at turn15 because then we would be at7 at turn15 (which is t=1) -> unsafe. So we must not go to7 at turn15. We can stay at6 or go down to5.\n\n   If we stay at6 at turn15: then at turn15 we are on freeway6 at turn15 (t=1): [31,42] -> safe.\n   Then at turn16: we can go to7? But then we are at7 at turn16 (t=2) -> unsafe. So we cannot.\n\n   Therefore, we must wait until turn17 to be at freeway7.\n\n   How? We need to be at freeway7 at the beginning of turn17. That means we must have been at freeway6 at the end of turn16. How to be at freeway6 at the end of turn16?\n\n   We start at turn14: at5.\n   We can go: \n        turn14: U -> to6 (end of turn14)\n        turn15: S -> stay at6 (end of turn15)\n        turn16: S -> stay at6 (end of turn16)\n        turn17: U -> to7 (end of turn17) -> then at turn17 we start at6? No: at the end of turn16 we are at6, so at the beginning of turn17 we are at6. Then we do U at turn17 to go to7 at the end of turn17. Then we are at7 at the end of turn17, so at the beginning of turn18 we are at7.\n\n   But we need to be at7 at the beginning of turn17? Only if we want to be there for the entire turn. Actually, we are at7 only at the beginning of turn18? Then we are at7 during turn18? And we check freeway7 at turn18 (t=4)? But t=4: freeway7 car3: [ -17+6*4, -6+24] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\n   But then we are at7 at the beginning of turn18. Then we do U at turn18 to go to8 at the end of turn18. Then at the beginning of turn19 we are at8. Then we do U at turn19 to go to9 at the end of turn19.\n\n   That would be 6 actions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can go to freeway7 at the beginning of turn17? How? We must be at freeway6 at the end of turn16. Then at turn17 we start at6 and then we do U to go to7 at the end of turn17. Then we are at7 at the end of turn17, so we are at7 for the entire turn18? No: during turn17 we are at6 (because we start at6 and we move to7 at the end). So we check freeway6 at turn17 (t=3): [25+18,36+18]=[43,54] -> safe. Then at turn18 we start at7. Then we check freeway7 at turn18 (t=4): safe as above. Then at turn18 we do U to go to8 at the end of turn18. Then at turn19 we start at8. Then we do U at turn19 to go to9 at the end of turn19.\n\n   Still 6 actions.\n\nBut we want minimal.\n\nWe need to be at freeway7 at the beginning of turn17. To be at freeway7 at the beginning of turn17, we must have been at freeway7 at the end of turn16. How to get to freeway7 at the end of turn16? \n\nWe start at5 at turn14. We need to go up twice: 5->6->7. But if we do:\n   turn14: U -> to6 (end of turn14)\n   turn15: U -> to7 (end of turn15)\n\nThen at the end of turn15 we are at7. Then at the beginning of turn16 we are at7. But that is t=2 (turn16 = 14+2) -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at7 at the beginning of turn16.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at7 until the beginning of turn17. So we must get to7 at the end of turn16. How? \n\nWe need two up moves: one to get to6 and then one to get to7. But we can delay the second up move until turn16.\n\nSo:\n   turn14: we do ... we can do S at turn14 to stay at5. Then at the end of turn14 we are at5.\n   turn15: U -> to6 (end of turn15)\n   turn16: U -> to7 (end of turn16) -> then at the beginning of turn17 we are at7.\n\nNow, at turn17 (t=3): freeway7 is safe.\n\nThen we can do:\n   turn17: U -> to8 (end of turn17) -> then at the beginning of turn18 we are at8.\n   turn18: U -> to9 (end of turn18)\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nTurn14: we are at5 (freeway5) at turn14: safe.\nAction: S -> so we stay at5. Then at turn15: we start at5.\n\nTurn15 (t=1): freeway5: [25+6,36+6]=[31,42] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to6 at end of turn15. Then at turn16: start at6.\n\nTurn16 (t=2): freeway6: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to7 at end of turn16. Then at turn17: start at7.\n\nTurn17 (t=3): freeway7: \n   car1: [43,54] -> safe\n   car2: [-35,-24] -> safe\n   car3: [1,12] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to8 at end of turn17. Then at turn18: start at8.\n\nTurn18 (t=4): freeway8: \n   car1: [49,60] -> safe\n   car2: [-29,-18] -> safe\n   car3: [7,18] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to9 at end of turn18.\n\nSo we are done at turn18. The actions are:\n\nTurn14: S\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\n\nThat's 5 actions.\n\nBut we have another option: without the initial stay? We can do:\n\nWe start at5 at turn14. We can do U at turn14 to go to6 at the end of turn14. Then at turn15: start at6.\n\nAt turn15 (t=1): freeway6: [31,42] -> safe.\nBut we cannot do U at turn15 to go to7 (because then at turn16 we start at7 and that is unsafe). So we must do something else: either S or D.\n\nIf we do S at turn15: then we stay at6. Then at turn16: start at6.\n\nThen at turn16 (t=2): freeway6: [37,48] -> safe.\nThen we do U at turn16: to go to7 at the end of turn16. Then at turn17: start at7 (t=3) -> safe.\n\nThen we do U at turn17: to8 at end of turn17 -> then turn18: start at8 (t=4) -> safe.\nThen U at turn18: to9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: S\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\n\nAlso 5 actions.\n\nIs there a way in 4 actions? \n\nWe need to be at9 at the end of the 4th action. So we do 4 consecutive ups? \n\nBut then:\n\nTurn14: U -> to6 (end of turn14) -> then turn15: start at6 (t=1: safe for freeway6)\nTurn15: U -> to7 (end of turn15) -> then turn16: start at7 (t=2: unsafe for freeway7)\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWhat if we do a detour? For example, go to 4? But that is away.\n\nOr, we could go to 5->6->5->6->7? But that would take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we might go to freeway8 first? But we have to go through 7 to get to8.\n\nUnless we go above? But we cannot go above 9.\n\nSo minimal is 5 turns.\n\nNow, which sequence? We have two:\n\nOption A:\n   Turn14: S\n   Turn15: U\n   Turn16: U\n   Turn17: U\n   Turn18: U\n\nOption B:\n   Turn14: U\n   Turn15: S\n   Turn16: U\n   Turn17: U\n   Turn18: U\n\nBoth are safe and take 5 turns.\n\nBut we must output one. We can choose either.\n\nHowever, note that in option A, we start by staying, which might be less efficient if there were other constraints, but here it's the same.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at turn15 for option A: in option A, at turn15 we are at freeway5? \n\nIn option A:\n   Turn14: S -> so at the end of turn14 we are at5. Then turn15: start at5. Then we do U at turn15: so we are at5 during turn15? Then we check freeway5 at turn15: t=1 -> [25+6,36+6]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, in option B: \n   Turn14: U -> then at turn14 we are at5 (the entire turn) and we check freeway5 at turn14: safe. Then at the end we move to6. Then turn15: start at6, and we do S -> so during turn15 we are at6: check freeway6 at turn15 (t=1): [31,42] -> safe.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWe can choose the one that moves first: option B (we move up immediately).\n\nBut note: we are at freeway5 at turn14 and we can move up immediately. So option B might be preferred.\n\nBut in both, we reach at the same time (turn18).\n\nSo we output option B.\n\nBut wait: in option B, at turn16 we do U: that moves from6 to7 at the end of turn16. Then at turn17 we start at7. Then we do U at turn17: to8 at the end of turn17. Then at turn18 we start at8 and then do U to9 at the end of turn18.\n\nAll safety checks are passed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut note: the answer format: we are to write for turns starting at t1 (which is 14) and then t1+1, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nWe must check if we can do it without the last U? But we are at8 at the beginning of turn18, and we need to be at9 at the end of turn18, so we must do U at turn18.\n\nBut note: we are at8 at turn18. We do U at turn18 to go to9 at the end of turn18. Then we are done.\n\nSo the sequence has 5 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1. We have H=5 actions: at t=0 (relative to the start) is turn14, then t=1 is turn15, ... up to t=4 (which is turn18). So H=5.\n\nNow, we must write the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for t=0: turn14, t=1: turn15, ... t=4: turn18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut the answer format says: \n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut note: the turn numbers: t1=14, so:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nWe must ensure that at turn18 we end at9. And we do.\n\nIs there a sequence with 4 actions? We think not, because we cannot avoid the dangerous turns 15 and 16 for freeway7 without an extra stay.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) is 5. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring that at each turn, the player's current freeway (at the start of the turn) does not have a car span containing 0.\n\n- At turn 14, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). The car on freeway 5 at turn 14 has span \\([25, 36]\\) (since \\(t = 0\\): \\(25 + 6 \\times 0 = 25\\), \\(36 + 6 \\times 0 = 36\\)), which does not contain 0. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at the end of turn 14.\n- At turn 15, the player starts at \\(y = 6\\). The car on freeway 6 at turn 15 (\\(t = 1\\)) has span \\([31, 42]\\) (\\(25 + 6 \\times 1 = 31\\), \\(36 + 6 \\times 1 = 36 + 6 = 42\\)), which does not contain 0. Action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 16, the player starts at \\(y = 6\\). The car on freeway 6 at turn 16 (\\(t = 2\\)) has span \\([37, 48]\\) (\\(25 + 6 \\times 2 = 25 + 12 = 37\\), \\(36 + 12 = 48\\)), which does not contain 0. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at the end of turn 16.\n- At turn 17, the player starts at \\(y = 7\\). The cars on freeway 7 at turn 17 (\\(t = 3\\)):\n  - First car: \\([43, 54]\\) (\\(25 + 6 \\times 3 = 25 + 18 = 43\\), \\(36 + 18 = 54\\))\n  - Second car: \\([-35, -24]\\) (\\(-53 + 6 \\times 3 = -53 + 18 = -35\\), \\(-42 + 18 = -24\\))\n  - Third car: \\([1, 12]\\) (\\(-17 + 18 = 1\\), \\(-6 + 18 = 12\\))\n  None contain 0. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at the end of turn 17.\n- At turn 18, the player starts at \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 18 (\\(t = 4\\)):\n  - First car: \\([49, 60]\\) (\\(25 + 6 \\times 4 = 25 + 24 = 49\\), \\(36 + 24 = 60\\))\n  - Second car: \\([-29, -18]\\) (\\(-53 + 24 = -29\\), \\(-42 + 24 = -18\\))\n  - Third car: \\([7, 18]\\) (\\(-17 + 24 = 7\\), \\(-6 + 24 = 18\\))\n  None contain 0. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at the end of turn 18.\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 5 turns (turns 14 to 18) and is minimal, as fewer turns would result in a collision on freeway 7 at turn 16 (if moving directly up without a stay) or other unsafe conditions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 16, and I need to find a sequence of actions starting from this turn.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, with y always between 0 and 9. So from y=6, I need to get to y=9, which is 3 units up, so at minimum, it would take 3 moves up, but I have to avoid cars.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, you're on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1}, but for collision, it's only based on where you are at the start of the turn, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T). If y_T is between 1 and 8, and there's a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at turn T, then collision occurs. If the player moves to a different row, that doesn't affect the current turn; it's for the next turn.\n\nNow, the cars are moving. For each car, I have its state at turn t_1=16: head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nThe update is given: for a left-moving car, span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], then Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's (0, -11, right, 12). But for left-moving, it should be decreasing, but here direction is right, so let's see right-moving.\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? It says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving? No.\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut for right-moving: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSince direction is right, and for right-moving, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h], so here τ is tail, h is head? But in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, head is larger, tail is smaller, I think.\n\nFor freeway 1: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nSince direction is right, the car is moving right, so at time t, span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]? From the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo here τ is tail, h is head, and since moving right, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and moving left, so span decreases.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, so tail τ = -11, head h=0, so at t_1=16, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -11 + 12*(T-16) , 0 + 12*(T-16) ] = [12(T-16) -11, 12(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (1≤y_T≤8) and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nSo I need to ensure that for each turn, when the player is on a freeway row (1-8), 0 is not in any car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nIf the player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision, since no freeway there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,6), which is freeway 6, so I need to check cars on row 6.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway k | Cars (h, τ, d, s)\n\n1: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\n2: (48, 37, right, 6)  // head=48, tail=37? That seems odd, tail should be less than head for right-moving?\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here head=48, tail=37, so tail=37, head=48, so τ=37, h=48? But in the tuple it's written as (head, tail), so (48,37) means head=48, tail=37.\n\nBut for right-moving, tail should be smaller, but 37 < 48, so tail=37, head=48, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [37,48], but the player is at x=0, so 0 is not in [37,48], so no issue now.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me list all cars per row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12)\n\nAt t_1=16, span: since right-moving, [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=6) → [37,48]\n\nFreeway 3: similarly (48,37,right,6) → [37,48]\n\nFreeway 4: (48,37,right,6) → [37,48]\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,6) → [37,48]\n\nFreeway 6: (48,37,right,6) → [37,48]  // row 6, player is here at t=16\n\nAt t=16, player is on row 6, with car span [37,48], 0 not in it, so no collision now.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFor each:\n\nFirst car: (h=48,τ=37,d=right,s=6) → [37,48]\n\nSecond car: (h=-30,τ=-41,d=right,s=6) → since right-moving, [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nThird car: (h=6,τ=-5,d=right,s=6) → [τ, h] = [-5,6]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same as 7? No, let's see:\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6) → same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on each row.\n\nBut for collision, only when the player is on that row at that turn.\n\nSince the player starts at y=6 and needs to go to y=9, which is up, so actions U will be needed.\n\nBut I need to go through rows 7 and 8 to reach 9.\n\ny=6 to y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut I might stay or move down to avoid cars, but since we need to go up, moving down might not be efficient, but sometimes necessary to wait.\n\nThe goal is to minimize turns, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row and each turn, whether there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince the player moves at each turn, I need to simulate the path.\n\nDefine t relative to t_1. Set t=0 as turn t_1=16, so at turn t (relative), actual turn is t_1 + t.\n\nAt turn t=0 (t_1=16), player at y=6.\n\nNow, for a given turn T (absolute), which is t_1 + t for some t.\n\nBut since t_1=16, T = 16 + t.\n\nNow, for a car on a freeway, with direction, speed, etc.\n\nSpan at time T: for right-moving car, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, since direction is right for all.\n\nIn the state, all cars have direction right, so all are right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - 16), h + s(T - 16)]\n\nSince right-moving.\n\nAnd collision for row k at time T if there is a car on row k with 0 in [τ + s(T-16), h + s(T-16)]\n\nThat is, τ + s(T-16) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-16)\n\nSimilarly for multiple cars, if any satisfies.\n\nNow for each row, I need to see when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row the cars and their τ, h, s.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ = -11, h = 0, s = 12\n\nSo at time T, span: [ -11 + 12(T-16) , 0 + 12(T-16) ] = [12(T-16) -11, 12(T-16)]\n\n0 in span if 12(T-16) -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 12(T-16)\n\nSet u = T-16, so for u≥0\n\n12u -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 12u\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 12u always true for u≥0.\n\n12u -11 ≤ 0 ⇒ 12u ≤ 11 ⇒ u ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\nSince u integer, u=0\n\nAt u=0, T=16, span: [12(0)-11, 12(0)] = [-11,0], so 0 ≤ 0 is true, and -11≤0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt u=1, T=17, span: [12(1)-11, 12(1)] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for row 1, car covers x=0 only at u=0, i.e., T=16.\n\nFor u=0 only.\n\nNow, at T=16, if player is on row 1, collision, but at T=16, player is on row 6, not row 1, so no issue.\n\nFor later, if player goes to row 1, but at T>16, no car covers x=0, so row 1 is always safe for T>16? At T=16 it has car, but player not there.\n\nFor T>16, u≥1, span min is 12(1)-11=1>0, so 0 not in span, so row 1 is safe for all T>16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car: τ=37, h=48, s=6\n\nAt T, span: [37 + 6(T-16), 48 + 6(T-16)] = [6(T-16) +37, 6(T-16) +48]\n\n0 in span if 6u +37 ≤ 0 ≤ 6u +48, u=T-16\n\n6u +37 ≤ 0? But u≥0, 6u+37≥37>0, so 0 < min span, so 0 never in span for this car. So row 2 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, τ=37,h=48,s=6, same as above, min span 37>0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=16, car: τ=37,h=48,s=6, span [37,48], 0 not in, and for T>16, span larger, so always safe? But player is on row 6 at T=16, but no collision since 0 not in span.\n\nBut for future, yes, row 6 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) → τ=37,h=48,s=6, same as above, span min 37>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6) → head=-30, tail=-41? Direction right, so τ=tail, h=head, so τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-16), h + s(T-16)] = [-41 + 6u, -30 + 6u] where u=T-16\n\n0 in span if -41 +6u ≤ 0 ≤ -30 +6u\n\nFirst, -41 +6u ≤ 0 ⇒ 6u ≤ 41 ⇒ u ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so u≤6\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -30 +6u ⇒ 6u ≥ 30 ⇒ u ≥ 5\n\nSo u from 5 to 6 inclusive.\n\nu=5: -41+30= -11 ≤0, -30+30=0≤0, so 0 in span\n\nu=6: -41+36= -5 ≤0, -30+36=6≥0, so 0 in [-5,6]\n\nu=7: -41+42=1>0, not ≤0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, u=4: -41+24= -17≤0, but -30+24= -6 <0, so 0 not ≤ -6? 0 ≤ -30+6u for u=4, -30+24=-6, 0 ≤ -6 false, so not satisfied.\n\nSo only u=5 and u=6, i.e., T=16+5=21 and T=16+6=22.\n\nThird car on row 7: (6,-5,right,6) → head=6, tail=-5, direction right, so τ=tail=-5, h=head=6, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s u, h + s u] = [-5 +6u, 6 +6u]\n\n0 in span if -5 +6u ≤ 0 ≤ 6 +6u\n\nNow, -5+6u ≤0 ⇒ 6u ≤5 ⇒ u≤5/6≈0.833, so u≤0 since u integer ≥0\n\nu=0: -5+0=-5≤0, 6+0=6≥0, so 0 in span? -5 ≤0≤6, yes.\n\nu=1: -5+6=1>0, not ≤0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only at u=0, T=16.\n\nBut at T=16, if player on row 7, but player is on row 6, not row 7.\n\nFor u≥1, no cover.\n\nSo for row 7, the dangerous times are:\n\n- From second car: at T=21 and T=22\n\n- From third car: at T=16, but only if player there, which not.\n\nFirst car never dangerous.\n\nSo row 7 has potential collision at T=21 and T=22 due to second car.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as row 7: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same, never dangerous.\n\nSecond car: same as row 7 second car, covers at u=5,6 T=21,22\n\nThird car: covers at u=0, T=16\n\nSo row 8 dangerous at T=16,21,22.\n\nBut at T=16, player not on row 8.\n\nNow, row 6: we have one car, but as above, never dangerous, since min span 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, rows 2,3,4,5 all safe always.\n\nRow 1 dangerous only at T=16, but player not there.\n\nSo only rows 7 and 8 have dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Row 7: dangerous at T=21 and T=22\n\n- Row 8: dangerous at T=16, T=21, T=22\n\nT=16 is past, player not on row 8 at T=16.\n\nPlayer starts at T=16 on row 6.\n\nNow, we need to reach row 9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer at turn t=0 (T=16) on y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S each turn.\n\ny changes only when we move U or D.\n\nFrom y=6 to y=9, we need to increase y by 3.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so minimum 3 turns with U.\n\nBut we might need to wait or move down to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times: for row 7, T=21 and 22\n\nFor row 8, T=21 and 22 (T=16 is irrelevant now)\n\nAt T=21 and 22, both row 7 and 8 are dangerous.\n\nT=21 is u=5, T=22 is u=6.\n\nNow, let t be the step from t_1, so at turn t, absolute time T = 16 + t.\n\nPlayer y-position: let y_t be position at turn t (relative), so y_0 = 6.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe need to find actions a_0, a_1, ..., up to some H, such that y_H = 9, with H minimal.\n\nAnd avoid collision: for each t, if 1 ≤ y_t ≤ 8, then for freeway y_t, no car has 0 in span at time T=16+t.\n\nNow, since rows 1-6 are always safe except row 1 at t=0 but not occupied, so for t≥0, rows 1-6 are always safe? Row 1 safe for t≥1, but at t=0, row 1 dangerous but player not there.\n\nFor player, since y_t for t≥0, and y_0=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 dangerous only at T=21 and 22, i.e., t=5 and t=6 (since T=16+t, so t=5: T=21, t=6: T=22)\n\nSimilarly, row 8 dangerous at same t=5 and t=6.\n\nT=16+t, so t=5: T=21, t=6: T=22.\n\nAlso, row 8 was dangerous at t=0, T=16, but player not there.\n\nNow, for t=5 and t=6, rows 7 and 8 are dangerous.\n\nWe need to ensure that if player is on row 7 or 8 at t=5 or t=6, collision.\n\nBut player might not be there at those times.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nFrom y=6, we can go directly up: U,U,U to reach y=9 in 3 turns.\n\nBut let's see where the player is at each turn.\n\nSet t starting from 0.\n\nAt t=0 (T=16): y=6, action a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δa_0\n\nThen at t=1, y_1, and so on.\n\nAfter H turns, y_H = 9, meaning at turn H, position is y_H=9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, actions a_t, leading to y_H.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, after action, y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIf we go U,U,U:\n\nStart t=0, y=6\n\nAfter a_0=U, y_1=7\n\nt=1, y=7, after a_1=U, y_2=8\n\nt=2, y=8, after a_2=U, y_3=9\n\nSo at t=3, y=9, so H=3 turns? Turns: from t=0 to t=2, actions a_0 to a_2, then at turn t=3, y_3=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, at turn H, position.\n\nIn this case, with 3 actions: a_0=U, a_1=U, a_2=U, then at turn t=3, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn from t=0 to t=2, if on freeway, no collision.\n\nt=0 (T=16): y=6, row 6, safe as established.\n\nt=1 (T=17): y=7, row 7. Now at T=17, which is u=1, from earlier, row 7 dangerous only at u=5,6 i.e. t=5,6? u=T-16, T=17, u=1.\n\nFor row 7, dangerous at u=5 and 6, not u=1.\n\nAt u=1, T=17, row 7: second car span [-41+6(1), -30+6(1)] = [-35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nThird car span [-5+6(1), 6+6(1)] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car never. So safe.\n\nt=2 (T=18): y=8, row 8. At T=18, u=2.\n\nRow 8: second car span [-41+6(2), -30+6(2)] = [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nThird car span [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car never. So safe.\n\nThen t=3, y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this case, with H=3, we reach y=9 at t=3, and no collisions.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=3 actions, from t=0 to t=2, then at t=3 position.\n\nSince we start at t=0, and after 3 actions, at t=3 we are at y=9.\n\nThe minimal possible is 3, since we need to increase y by 3.\n\nCould we do it in less? No, because each action changes y by at most 1, so from 6 to 9, min 3 actions.\n\nS or D would keep y same or decrease, so not helpful for reaching faster.\n\nSo H=3 should be possible.\n\nIn the sequence above, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor row 7, dangerous at T=21 and 22, which are t=5 and 6.\n\nIn our path, at t=1, T=17, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly row 8 at t=2, T=18, not dangerous.\n\nAnd at t=5 and 6, if player were on row 7 or 8, but in this path, at t=3 we are at y=9, so for t=3,4,5,... we are on y=9, safe, not on freeway.\n\nt=3: y=9, T=19, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions starting from turn t_1=16.\n\nSo actions: at turn 16: U, then turn 17: U, then turn 18: U, then at turn 19, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, we reach.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} , which is turn 16: action\n\nThen turn 17: action, etc.\n\nIn this case:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen after that, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut H=3 actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"minimal number of turns H\".\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach the position.\n\nIn this case, H=3.\n\nBut let me see if we can finish earlier? No, because at t=0, we are at y=6, after one action, min y=7, after two, min y=8, after three, y=9. So min H=3.\n\nWith S or D, we might take more turns, so H=3 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence above, no collisions, as we checked.\n\nBut is there a problem at row 7 or 8?\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, there are cars, but at T=17 and 18, no car covers x=0.\n\nFor example, row 7 at T=17: cars: second car span [-35,-24], third car [1,12], both not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly row 8 at T=18: same, spans [-29,-18] and [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the player is at (0,6) at turn 16, after U to y=7 at turn 17, etc.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd that's it, since after three actions, at turn 19, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is for actions up to turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1 + H-1 = 16 + 3 -1 = 18, so actions from turn 16 to 18.\n\nThen at turn 19, we have reached.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the car on row 6, but it's safe.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait because of the future dangers, but in this case, since we reach before t=5, no issue.\n\nt=5 is T=21, which is later.\n\nIn this path, we are done by t=3, T=19.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut the question is, is there a reason to take more turns? Only if we collide, but we don't.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on row 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars, but we only care about x=0 coverage.\n\nAt T=17, u=1, row 7:\n\nSecond car: [-41 +6(1), -30 +6(1)] = [-35, -24], min -35<0, max -24<0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-5 +6(1), 6+6(1)] = [1,12], min 1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nFirst car: [37+6(1),48+6(1)]=[43,54], not.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 same at T=18, u=2:\n\nSecond car: [-41+12, -30+12]=[-29,-18], both negative.\n\nThird car: [-5+12,6+12]=[7,18], both positive.\n\nSo 0 not covered.\n\nThus, the sequence is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=3, actions: U at 16, U at 17, U at 18.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,6) at turn 16.\n\nAnd cars, but all seem fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving down or staying to avoid, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the note about not being on the new row immediately.\n\nIn this case, when we move from y=6 to y=7 at turn 16, after action U, we are on y=7 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 16, we are on y=6, and we take action U, so for collision at turn 16, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, we are on y=7, and we check row 7 at T=17, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 18, on y=8, row 8 at T=18, safe.\n\nThen after action U at turn 18, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem might be that for row 8, at T=16 it was dangerous, but we are not there at that time.\n\nIn the car state for row 8, there is a car (6,-5,right,6) which at T=16 covers [-5,6], so 0 in it, but at T=16, player is on row 6, not row 8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 3.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd we are done.\n\nBut the answer format should be in a box.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\end{array} }\n\nOr something similar.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., probably list them.\n\nIn text.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nSince H=3, and actions.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has car (48,37,right,6), span at T=16: [37,48], not cover 0.\n\nAt other times, even less likely.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nSo I believe this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of turns required to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve this.\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway row \\(y_t\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_t \\leq 8\\)) at turn \\(t\\), and a car on that row has a span that includes x=0 at the absolute time \\(T = 16 + t\\) (where \\(t\\) is the turn index relative to \\(t_1 = 16\\)).\n\n#### Car Span and Dangerous Times:\n- **Freeway 1**: Dangerous only at \\(T = 16\\) (\\(t = 0\\)), but player is not on row 1 at that time. Safe for \\(t \\geq 0\\).\n- **Freeways 2-6**: Always safe, as no car covers x=0 at any \\(T \\geq 16\\).\n- **Freeway 7**: Dangerous at \\(T = 21\\) (\\(t = 5\\)) and \\(T = 22\\) (\\(t = 6\\)) due to the second car \\((-30, -41, \\text{right}, 6)\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Dangerous at \\(T = 16\\) (irrelevant, player not present), \\(T = 21\\) (\\(t = 5\\)), and \\(T = 22\\) (\\(t = 6\\)) due to the second and third cars.\n\nThe dangerous times for rows 7 and 8 are at \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 6\\) (absolute \\(T = 21\\) and \\(T = 22\\)), but these occur after the player can reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(t = 3\\) (\\(T = 19\\)).\n\n#### Optimal Path:\n- At turn \\(t = 0\\) (\\(T = 16\\)): Player at \\(y = 6\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 1\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 1\\) (\\(T = 17\\)): Player at \\(y = 7\\). Row 7 is safe at \\(T = 17\\) (spans: \\([-35, -24]\\) and \\([1, 12]\\), no x=0 coverage). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 2\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 2\\) (\\(T = 18\\)): Player at \\(y = 8\\). Row 8 is safe at \\(T = 18\\) (spans: \\([-29, -18]\\) and \\([7, 18]\\), no x=0 coverage). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 3\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 3\\) (\\(T = 19\\)): Player at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe (no freeway).\n\nThis path reaches \\(y = 9\\) in \\(H = 3\\) turns with no collisions. Since \\(H = 3\\) is the minimum possible (as \\(y\\) must increase by 3), and no shorter path exists, this is optimal.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- Turn 16: U (move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17)\n- Turn 17: U (move from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18)\n- Turn 18: U (move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19)\n\nAfter these actions, the player is at (0, 9) at turn 19.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 17, and I have to find the sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay) for each turn starting from t1.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U increases y by 1, D decreases y by 1, S keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway can have multiple cars, each with a head, tail, direction, and speed. Cars move left or right, and their positions change linearly with time.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. The span is the interval covered by the car.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So, if at turn T, the player is at y_T, and they move to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T, they are still considered on y_T for collision purposes. Only at turn T+1 are they on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So, at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked based on y_T and the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision is checked for that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nAlso, cars move continuously, so their positions at any turn T can be calculated based on initial state at t1.\n\nt1 is given as 17, but in the car update, it says \"at turn T > t1\", but for collision at turn T, we need the car positions at T.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = t1 = 17.\n\nAt turn t, player is at (0, y_t) = (0,7).\n\nI need to find actions for turns t, t+1, t+2, ..., up to some H where at turn t+H-1, y = 9. The sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, but since t1 is given, I'll use absolute turns for clarity.\n\nLet t_start = 17.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only move up or down by 1 each turn, the minimum number of turns to go from 7 to 9 is 2, if we move up twice. But we have to avoid cars, so it might not be possible in 2 turns, or we might need to wait or detour.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are freeways with cars, so we need to check if moving up to 8 at some turn causes collision, and similarly for 9.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there. But the player is on the grid at x=0, and for y=0 and y=9, since no freeway, no cars, so safe.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=9, since no freeway, no collision, so we can be there safely.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0, y), and we move vertically, so x is always 0, I think.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, cars move horizontally on their freeways.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn, when player is at (0, y), if y is between 1 and 8, we check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nSpan is the interval [min, max] where the car is, and if x=0 is within that interval, collision.\n\nCars are moving horizontally, so their position changes with time.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at t1=17.\n\nFor each freeway k, cars are given with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: span goes from [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] for T > t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: from [τ, h] to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, head and tail are given such that h and τ, with head and tail, but direction specifies left or right.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so since it's moving right, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [1, 12], I think.\n\nThe notation: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so tail τ, head h, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], with h > τ, since moving left, head is left or something.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo at t1, positions from h to τ, with h > τ since moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so τ < h.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right direction, head is the right end, tail left end? Not necessarily.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end (tail), h is the right end (head), so tail ≤ head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], with h ≥ τ, h is left end (head), τ right end (tail).\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so I need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so span at t1: since right, [τ, h] = [1, 12], so tail=1, head=12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (54, 43, right, 6), so [43, 54] since τ=43, h=54.\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail), but for right, span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn the input, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nSimilarly for left, head smaller, tail larger, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars at t1=17.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=12, tail=1, dir=right, speed=12) so span [1,12] at t1.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (54,43,right,6) so [43,54]\n\nFreeway 3: (54,43,right,6) same as above? But freeway 3 is different row.\n\nEach freeway has its own cars.\n\nFreeway 3: (54,43,right,6) so [43,54]\n\nSimilarly freeway 4,5,6 all the same: (54,43,right,6) so [43,54] each.\n\nThat seems odd, but possible.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nFor each, since right direction, span at t1:\n\nFirst car: head=54, tail=43, so [43,54]\n\nSecond car: head=-24, tail=-35, so since right, [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n\nThird car: head=12, tail=1, so [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6) so spans [-35,-24], [1,12], [43,54] at t1.\n\nNow, for collision, we care about when x=0 is covered by a car on the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7 at turn t=17.\n\ny=7 is a freeway, so we need to check freeway 7.\n\nAt turn t=17, player is on y=7.\n\nCars on y=7: three cars with spans: [-35,-24], [1,12], [43,54] at t=17.\n\nx=0: is 0 in any of these? [-35,-24] is negative, [1,12] is 1 to 12, 0 not in, [43,54] not. So at t=17, x=0 not covered, so no collision at start. Good.\n\nNow, we need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 or y=9 at some point.\n\nSince we start at y=7, to go to y=9, we need to go to y=8 then y=9, or stay and then go, but going directly up might be possible if no cars block.\n\nBut y=8 has cars, and we need to avoid collision when on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, when moving, if we move to a different y, at the turn we move, we are still on the previous y.\n\nLet me denote the turn number T, starting from T=17.\n\nPlayer position y_T.\n\nAt each turn T, we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y, with delta y = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nThen at turn T, player is on y_T, and we check collision for freeway y_T if 1<=y_T<=8.\n\nCollision if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nFor freeway y, at turn T, the car spans are calculated based on t1=17.\n\nTime elapsed: delta_t = T - 17.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time T, span is:\n\nIf direction right: [τ + s*(T-17), h + s*(T-17)]\n\nIf direction left: [h - s*(T-17), τ - s*(T-17)]\n\nThen, for that freeway, if 0 is in the span for any car, collision when player is on that row.\n\nNow, player wants to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can reach it directly if we can get there.\n\nMinimum turns: from y=7 to y=9, at least 2 actions: two Ups.\n\nBut we need to check if it's possible without collision.\n\nOption 1: at T=17, action U, so y_{18} = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nAt T=17, player is on y=7, action U means at turn 17, we are on y=7, then after action, at turn 18, we are on y=8.\n\nNow, collision at T=17: on y=7, as before, no collision, safe.\n\nAt turn 18, player is on y=8.\n\nNow, check freeway y=8 at turn T=18.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: same as freeway 7 at t1, but we need at T=18.\n\nFirst, at t1=17, freeway 8 cars: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nSo for each, direction right, so at time T, span:\n\nGeneral: for right-moving car, span(T) = [τ + s*(T-17), h + s*(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all here are right-moving.\n\nSo for first car: τ=43, h=54, s=6\n\nAt T=18, delta_t=1, span = [43 + 6*1, 54 + 6*1] = [49, 60]\n\nSecond car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, span at T=18: [-35 + 6*1, -24 + 6*1] = [-29, -18]\n\nThird car: τ=1, h=12, s=6, span: [1 + 6*1, 12 + 6*1] = [7, 18]\n\nNow, on freeway 8 at T=18, spans: [49,60], [-29,-18], [7,18]\n\nx=0: is 0 in any? [49,60] no, [-29,-18] no, [7,18] 0 not in, since 7 to 18, 0<7, not included. So no collision at T=18.\n\nThen, at turn 18, we can take another action to go to y=9.\n\nSuppose at T=18, action U, then y_{19} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAt T=18, player on y=8, we just checked no collision.\n\nThen at T=19, player on y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo we reached y=9 at turn 19, with two actions: U at T=17, U at T=18.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nAt T=17: action U, so from y=7 to y=8.\n\nAt T=17, player on y=7, no collision.\n\nThen at T=18, player on y=8, and we checked no collision.\n\nThen at T=18, action U, so to y=9 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, player on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo in two turns, we reached y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=17 to t=17+H-1, and at turn t+ H-1, y=9.\n\nHere H=2 actions: at t=17 and t=18, so at turn t+1 =18, y=8, not 9. Turn indexing.\n\nDefine: at turn T, after action, position for next turn? No.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1=17 as (0,7), so at the start of turn t1, before action, I think.\n\nLet's see the update.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, the player is at y_t, and we are on row y_t for collision.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{t+1}, but for collision at turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t+1, we are on y_{t+1} for collision.\n\nIn this case, at t=17, y=7.\n\nWe take action a_{17}, which sets y_{18}.\n\nThen at turn t=18, we are at y_{18}, and so on.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nWith H actions, from t=17 to t=17+H-1, the position at turn t+H-1 is y_{t+H-1}, and we set it to 9.\n\nFor example, with two actions: at t=17, a_{17}=U, so y_{18} = 8.\n\nThen at t=18, a_{18}=U, so y_{19} =9.\n\nSo at turn t+1 =18, y=8, at turn t+2=19, y=9.\n\nSo to have y=9 at turn T, we need T = t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nt1=17, after H actions, the last position is after H actions, so turn number increases.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 17, y=7.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 18, y= something.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 17+k, y= y_{17+k}.\n\nWe want y_{17+H} =9? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1} = a_{17}\n\nFor t=1, a_{18}\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y after H actions.\n\nBut we want this to be 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nFor example, with H=1: actions from t=0 to 0, so one action a_{t1}, then at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, we want y_{t1} =9, but at start y_{t1}=7, so impossible with H=1.\n\nWith H=2: actions a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}, then at turn (t1 + 2 -1) = t1 +1, y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nIn my earlier, with a_{17}=U, y_{18}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1+1} =9, we need to go from y=7 to y=9 in one step? But we can only change by 1, so impossible to reach y=9 in one action from y=7.\n\nMinimum H: since we need to increase y by 2, we need at least two actions, so H>=2.\n\nWith two actions, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} must be 9.\n\nBut from y_{t1}=7, after one action, y_{t1+1} can be 6,7, or 8, not 9. After two actions, y_{t1+2} can be 5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny_{t1+2} can be 9 if we move up twice.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, for H=2, t1 +2 -1 = t1 +1, so y_{t1+1} must be 9, but from above, y_{t1+1} can be at most 8, so impossible to have y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nLet T_start = t1 =17.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nWe want at some turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nAnd T_final = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=1: T_final = t1 +1 -1 = t1 =17, y_{17}=7 ≠9.\n\nH=2: T_final =17+2-1=18, y_{18} must be 9.\n\nBut from y_{17}=7, after one action, y_{18} can be 6,7, or 8, not 9.\n\nH=3: T_final =17+3-1=19, y_{19} must be 9.\n\nFrom y_{17}=7, after two actions, y_{19} can be 9 if we move up twice.\n\nSimilarly, H=4, T_final=20, etc.\n\nSo minimal possible H is 3, with T_final=19, y_{19}=9.\n\nWith actions at t=17 and t=18, we can set y_{19}=9.\n\nFor example, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=8; a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9.\n\nOr other sequences.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at the turns when on freeways.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=17, on y=7; T=18, on y=8 if we move up; then at T=19, on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, collision at T=17 on y=7: as before, at T=17, cars on y=7: spans [-35,-24], [1,12], [43,54] at T=17, x=0 not in any, so safe.\n\nAt T=18, if we are on y=8, we need to check freeway 8 at T=18.\n\nAs I calculated earlier for T=18: spans [49,60], [-29,-18], [7,18] for the three cars.\n\nx=0 not in any, since [7,18] starts at 7>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nThus, with a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, we have at T=19, y=9, and no collision at T=17 or T=18.\n\nT=19 is y=9, no freeway, no issue.\n\nSo this seems to work with H=3? H is the number of actions.\n\nSequence: two actions, a_{17} and a_{18}, so H=2 actions, but T_final = t1 + H -1 =17 +2 -1=18, but y_{18}=8, not 9. Contradiction.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet's read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"the sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nFor example, if H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1, so a_{17} and a_{18}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =17+2-1=18, we reach (0,9) at turn 18.\n\nBut with actions, from y_{17}=7, after a_{17}, y_{18} is set, so at turn 18, position is y_{18}.\n\nTo have y_{18}=9, but from y_{17}=7, y_{18} can only be 6,7,8, not 9. Impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for H=3, actions at t=17,18,19? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=3, t=0,1,2: a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}.\n\nThen T_final = t1 + H -1 =17+3-1=19, so at turn 19, y_{19} must be 9.\n\nWith three actions: a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}.\n\nBut we want y_{19}=9.\n\nFrom y_{17}=7, after three actions, we can reach y=9.\n\nFor example, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=8; a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9; then a_{19} is not needed for position, but we have to specify actions up to a_{19}, but when we reach y=9, we can stop, but the sequence includes all actions until we reach.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H=3, we have three actions, but after two actions we are at y=9 at turn 19? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 17: position y_{17}=7\n\nAfter a_{17}, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17}\n\nAt turn 18: position y_{18}\n\nAfter a_{18}, y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_{18}\n\nAt turn 19: position y_{19}\n\nAfter a_{19}, y_{20} = y_{19} + Δy_{19}\n\nWe want at turn T_final = t1 + H -1 =19 for H=3, y_{19}=9.\n\nSo with a_{17} and a_{18}, we can set y_{19}=9, for example a_{17}=U, y_{18}=8; a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9.\n\nThen at turn 19, we are at y=9, so we have reached. The action a_{19} is still part of the sequence, but since we are already at y=9, a_{19} can be anything, S for example, but we need to minimize H, so probably we stop when we reach.\n\nFor H=3, we have three actions, but we reach at turn 19 after two actions? No.\n\nAfter a_{17} and a_{18}, at turn 19, y_{19} is set, so we are at y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut the action at t=19, a_{19}, is also performed, which might change position, but we can choose a_{19}=S to stay at y=9.\n\nBut the position at turn 19 is before a_{19} or after?\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, and action a_T is taken at turn T, setting y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nAt turn T_final, we are at y_{T_final} =9.\n\nFor T_final = t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=2, T_final=18, y_{18} must be 9, impossible from y_{17}=7.\n\nH=3, T_final=19, y_{19} can be 9.\n\nWith two actions: a_{17} and a_{18}, we can set y_{19}=9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1, so a_{17} and a_{18}, then T_final=18, y_{18} must be 9, impossible.\n\nFor H=3, actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, so a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, T_final=19, y_{19} can be 9.\n\nAnd we can have a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, then y_{19}=9.\n\nThen a_{19} can be S, for example, to stay.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 19, and a_{19} is part of the sequence, but with a_{19}=S, y_{20}=9, but we don't care about later.\n\nBut for the position at turn 19, it is set before a_{19}, so y_{19} is determined by previous actions.\n\nIn this case, with a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9, so at turn 19, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen a_{19} can be S or U or D, but since we are already at the goal, we can choose S to not move.\n\nBut the minimal H should be as small as possible.\n\nIs it possible with H=2? No, because we can't reach y=9 at turn 18 from y=7 at turn 17.\n\nWith one action, y_{18} <=8.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nWith H=3, we can do it as above.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for H=3, we have three actions, but only two are needed to reach, but we have to specify H actions.\n\nWe can have a sequence where we reach earlier, but since H=3 is minimal possible, we need to include the actions.\n\nIn this case, with a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, and a_{19}=S, for example.\n\nThen at turn 19, y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, collision: at turn 17, on y=7, no collision as before.\n\nAt turn 18, on y=8? When are we on y=8?\n\nAt turn 17, after a_{17}=U, y_{18}=8.\n\nThen at turn 18, position y_{18}=8, so we are on freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nCheck collision at turn 18 on y=8.\n\nAs before, at T=18, cars on y=8: spans [49,60], [-29,-18], [7,18]\n\nx=0 not in [7,18] because 7 to 18, 0 <7, so not included. Other spans not cover 0. So safe.\n\nAt turn 19, on y=9, safe.\n\nThen a_{19}=S, y_{20}=9, but not relevant.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=3, we have actions at 17,18,19.\n\nBut we reach at turn 19.\n\nIs there a way with fewer actions? H=2 impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by moving faster, but we can't, since max one step per turn.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but in this case, at the turns we are on them, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 18 on y=8, span of third car is [7,18], which is from 7 to 18 inclusive, so positions 7,8,...,18.\n\nx=0 is not in this, since 0<7.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17 on y=7, cars: at T=17, third car on y=7 is (12,1,right,6), so at T=17, span [1 +0, 12+0] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nOn y=7 at T=17, the third car has span [1,12], since s=6, but at T=17, delta_t=0, so [1,12].\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly on y=8 at T=18, [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We don't care, since we are not on them.\n\nSo this sequence seems fine.\n\nBut the player is at y=7 at turn 17, we move up to y=8 at turn 18, then to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nWith actions: a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, and for H=3, we need a_{19}, so a_{19}=S.\n\nThen sequence: Turn 17: U, Turn 18: U, Turn 19: S.\n\nAnd at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut we reached at turn 19 with the second action, but since H=3, we have three actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we start by staying or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing at first, but then it takes more actions to reach.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nThe car with span [7,18] at T=18, which includes x=7 to x=18.\n\nx=0 is not in this, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the problem has multiple freeways with cars, but in this case, we only care about the rows we are on.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are the only ones we might be on, since we start at 7 and go to 8.\n\ny=6 or lower, but we are going up, so not relevant.\n\nBut in this path, we are only on y=7 at T=17 and y=8 at T=18.\n\nNow, but freeway 7 has cars at T=17, which we checked.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if at other times, but we are not on other rows.\n\nPerhaps there is a car that might cover x=0 at some turn, but since we are only on specific rows at specific turns, as long as at those points it's clear.\n\nAnother thing: the cars are moving, and for example, on freeway 8, at turn 18, we have [7,18], which is fine.\n\nBut let's see if at turn 17 or 19, but we are not on y=8 at those times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 7 and 8 have the same cars, but different rows.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=17: cars with spans [-35,-24], [1,12], [43,54]\n\nFreeway 8 at T=18: after one turn, spans [ -35+6= -29, -24+6=-18 ]? Earlier I had for y=8 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, delta_t=1 from t1.\n\nFor freeway 8 cars:\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), at T=18: [43 +6*1, 54+6*1] = [49,60]\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35, so [τ + s dT, h + s dT] = [-35 +6, -24 +6] = [-29, -18]\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,6), [1+6,12+6]=[7,18]\n\nYes.\n\nx=0 not in any.\n\nSimilarly, if we had stayed or something, but we don't need.\n\nSo with H=3, actions: a17=U, a18=U, a19=S.\n\nBut a19=S is not necessary, but since we need to specify H actions, and we reach at turn 19, we can include it.\n\nPerhaps we can have only two actions, but impossible.\n\nAnother way: if we could reach at turn 18, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps by going down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go down to y=6, then up to y=7,8,9, but that takes at least three actions to go to 9, same as up-up, but with more steps.\n\nFrom y=7 to y=6, then to y=7, then to y=8, then to y=9, takes four actions, worse.\n\nSo direct up-up is best.\n\nBut in this case, with the cars, it seems possible.\n\nBut let's check if at turn 18 on y=8, the span [7,18] includes x=0? No, 7 to 18, 0 is not in, since 0 <7.\n\nThe span is inclusive, I assume, since it's positions.\n\nBut 0 is not between 7 and 18.\n\nSimilarly, only integers? The positions are on a grid, so x positions are integers, I think.\n\nThe freeway has positions, and cars occupy integer positions from tail to head inclusive.\n\nIn the span, [min,max] includes all integers from min to max.\n\nSo [7,18] includes x=7,8,9,...,18.\n\nx=0 is not included.\n\nSimilarly, other spans.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, with actions: U at t=17, U at t=18, S at t=19.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0: a17, t=1: a18, t=2: a19.\n\nAnd T_final =17+3-1=19, y19=9.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway 1 to 6 also have cars, but we don't care since we are not on those rows.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=17, car (12,1,right,12), span [1,12], but we are not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut just to note, for example, freeway 1 car has speed 12, so it moves fast, but irrelevant.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have a19=S, which is fine.\n\nBut perhaps we don't need to specify a19, but since H=3, we must include three actions.\n\nTo minimize H, H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? No.\n\nPerhaps if we start by staying, but then we reach later.\n\nFor example, if at t=17, we do S, y18=7, then at t=18, U, y19=8, then at t=19, U, y20=9, then we reach at turn 20, with H=4, worse.\n\nSo better to move up immediately.\n\nThus, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=17.\n\nSequence for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=3, so:\n\nTurn t1 + 0: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn t1 + 1: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn t1 + 2: a_{19} = S\n\nAnd we reach at turn t1 + H -1 =17+3-1=19.\n\nPosition at turn 19: y19=9.\n\nIn the sequence, a19=S, but at turn 19, we are at y19=9 before action, so collision not an issue since y=9 safe.\n\nAfter a19=S, y20=9, but not relevant.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a19=U, but y20=10, but y=10 not exist, y must be in [0,9], so we cannot go above 9 or below 0.\n\ny_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=9, we can only do S or D, not U.\n\nBut in this case, since we are at 9, we do S.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but we need H=3 actions.\n\nAnother thought: can we reach at turn 18? Only if we are at y=9 at turn 18, but from y=7 at 17, impossible.\n\nUnless we start higher, but we start at 7.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 7 and 8, there are cars that might cover x=0 at some other time, but we are only concerned when we are on that row.\n\nFor example, on freeway 7, at turn 17, we are safe.\n\nBut suppose at turn 17, if we had stayed, then at turn 18 on y=7, we might have collision or not.\n\nAt turn 18 on y=7: freeway 7 cars at T=18.\n\nT=18, delta_t=1 from t1.\n\nFreeway 7: cars same as before.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), at T=18: [43+6,54+6]=[49,60]\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,6), [-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18]\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,6), [1+6,12+6]=[7,18]\n\nx=0 not in any, so even if we stayed, no collision at turn 18 on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, but we don't need.\n\nNow, back to the point.\n\nPerhaps I should check if moving up immediately is safe, which it seems.\n\nBut let's see the cars on other freeways, but not necessary.\n\nOne thing: in freeway 7 and 8, there is a car with (12,1,right,6) which at T=17 on y=7 has [1,12], and at T=18 on y=8 has [7,18], both not covering 0.\n\nBut what about at T=17.5 or something? But turns are discrete, so only integer turns matter.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is two Ups and one Stay at the end.\n\nBut with three actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=2 with reaching at turn 18, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=3 is the answer.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: S }\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} \\\\ Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} \\\\ ... }\n\nFor H=3, we have three lines: Turn 17: a_{17}, Turn 18: a_{18}, Turn 19: a_{19}\n\nWith a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, a_{19}=S.\n\nAnd we reach at turn 19.\n\nPerhaps we can omit the last action if not needed, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nTo confirm, suppose we do only two actions: a17=U, a18=U, then at turn 18, y18=8, not 9, so we haven't reached yet. At turn 19, y19=9, but without a19, if we stop, but the position at turn 19 is after a18, but to have y19=9, we need to specify a18.\n\nWith two actions: a17 and a18, y19 is set, but at turn t1 + H -1 =17 +2 -1=18, we are at y18=8, not 9.\n\nSo we must have H=3 to reach at turn 19.\n\nThus, minimal H is 3.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 17 + H - 1\\) with the minimal number of actions \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- From the initial position \\(y = 7\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires an increase of 2 units in the vertical position. Since each action (U, D, or S) changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, at least 2 actions are needed to reach \\(y = 9\\). However:\n  - After 1 action (at turn 17), \\(y_{18}\\) can be 6, 7, or 8 (not 9).\n  - After 2 actions (at turns 17 and 18), \\(y_{19}\\) can be 5 to 9, so \\(y_{19} = 9\\) is possible.\n- The turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is \\(t_1 + H - 1\\). For \\(H = 2\\), this turn is \\(17 + 2 - 1 = 18\\), but \\(y_{18} \\leq 8\\), so reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18 is impossible. For \\(H = 3\\), the turn is \\(17 + 3 - 1 = 19\\), and \\(y_{19} = 9\\) can be achieved.\n- Thus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 3, with the goal position reached at turn 19.\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **At turn 17 (player on \\(y = 7\\)):**  \n  Cars on freeway 7 at \\(T = 17\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 17\\), \\(\\Delta t = 0\\)):\n  - Car 1: \\((54, 43, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span = \\([43, 54]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [43, 54]\\)\n  - Car 2: \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span = \\([-35, -24]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [-35, -24]\\)\n  - Car 3: \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span = \\([1, 12]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\)  \n  No collision at turn 17.\n\n- **Action at turn 17: U** → \\(y_{18} = 7 + 1 = 8\\)\n\n- **At turn 18 (player on \\(y = 8\\)):**  \n  Cars on freeway 8 at \\(T = 18\\) (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)):\n  - Car 1: \\((54, 43, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span = \\([43 + 6 \\times 1, 54 + 6 \\times 1] = [49, 60]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [49, 60]\\)\n  - Car 2: \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span = \\([-35 + 6 \\times 1, -24 + 6 \\times 1] = [-29, -18]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [-29, -18]\\)\n  - Car 3: \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span = \\([1 + 6 \\times 1, 12 + 6 \\times 1] = [7, 18]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [7, 18]\\) (since \\(0 < 7\\))  \n  No collision at turn 18.\n\n- **Action at turn 18: U** → \\(y_{19} = 8 + 1 = 9\\)\n\n- **At turn 19 (player on \\(y = 9\\)):**  \n  \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway, so no collision possible. The position (0, 9) is reached.\n\n- **Action at turn 19: S** → \\(y_{20} = 9\\) (to stay at the goal; this action is required for \\(H = 3\\) but does not affect the position at turn 19).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 3, with the sequence:\n- Turn 17: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18)\n- Turn 18: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19)\n- Turn 19: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\) for completeness)\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions and reaches (0, 9) at turn 19 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 17 + 3 - 1 = 19\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ S} }",
