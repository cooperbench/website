        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn t_1 = 0:\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are walls. Also, internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). I should list all these to visualize.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5).\n\n- Snake positions: Only one segment, the head at (3,3). So the snake is just the head, no body yet. That means it's length 1.\n\n- Snake head direction: L, which is left. So current direction is left.\n\n- Food:\n  - (1,1) with value 1, life span 10\n  - (3,2) with value 1, life span 10\n  - (5,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food here. Life span 10 means they disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so countdown starts from 10 down to 0.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, there's no body to worry about. Also, because it's just the head, moving onto food will increase length to 2.\n\nNow, I need to decide the action for turn 0, and since the answer format says to provide actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and the answer should be actions starting from turn t_1=0 onwards. The format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: action\nTurn 1: action\n...\n}\n\nBut how many turns should I plan? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 turns, but since the snake might grow, I need to simulate multiple moves.\n\nAlso, since the snake is currently at (3,3) and direction is left, possible moves are U, D, L, R, but I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. Therefore, I cannot move right on the next turn. But for turn 0, since we're at the start, I can choose any direction except the opposite? No, the rule is: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nFor turn 0, current direction is L, so for turn 0 action, I can choose U, D, L, but not R, because R is opposite to L.\n\nLet me confirm the movement constraints.\n\n\" In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1), L(x-1,y), R(x+1,y) \"\n\nAnd \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nSo for turn t, the action chosen must not be opposite to the direction at the start of turn t.\n\nAt turn t=0, direction is L, so action cannot be R.\n\nTherefore, possible actions for turn 0: U, D, L. Not R.\n\nNow, let's see the food positions:\n\n- (1,1): which is left and down from (3,3), but with walls and obstacles.\n\n- (3,2): directly below (3,3), since (3,3) to (3,2) is down. y decreases down, I think? Let's see coordinate system.\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume. D is (x,y-1), so y decreases down.\n\nStandard grid: (0,0) is bottom-left? But in the walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so probably (0,0) is bottom-left, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo head at (3,3).\n\nFood at (3,2): which is same x, y=2, so down from head.\n\n(3,3) to (3,2) is down (D).\n\nFood at (1,1): left and down.\n\nFood at (5,3): right, but x=5, y=3, so right from (3,3).\n\nBut I cannot move right immediately because of no reverse.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's list all blocked cells.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is an obstacle, which is above (3,3)? (3,3) to (3,5) would be up, but y=5 is north.\n\nSince (3,5) is obstacle, I cannot go there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is obstacle, etc.\n\nNow, since snake is only head, no body, so no collision risk except walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, for food, when I eat, length increases.\n\nFood at (3,2) is directly below, and I can move down to eat it immediately.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but since no tail, not an issue yet.\n\nLet me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nHead at (3,3)\n\nObstacles:\n- (6,4)\n- (5,1)\n- (2,4)\n- (6,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (5,6)\n- (5,2)\n- (3,5)  // directly above, cannot go up to (3,4) or (3,5)? (3,5) is obstacle, so (3,4) is free? But (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\n(3,5) is blocked, so I can go to (3,4), but not to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,2) is below, and (3,2) is not blocked, so I can go down to (3,2).\n\nFood at (1,1): let's see path.\n\n(1,1) has obstacle at (1,2)? (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) is surrounded? (1,2) is obstacle, so to reach (1,1), I need to go through (1,0) or something, but y=0 is wall, so (1,0) is wall.\n\nx=0 or y=0 are walls, so (1,0) is on border, x=1,y=0, since y=0 is wall, it's blocked. Similarly, (0,1) is wall.\n\nSo (1,1) is corner? x=1,y=1, not border, but surrounded: north is (1,2) obstacle, south is (1,0) wall, east is (2,1), west is (0,1) wall.\n\n(2,1) might be free, but to reach (1,1), I need to go to (2,1) first or something.\n\nFrom (3,3), to (1,1), I could go left and down, but with obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,3): (5,3), which is east of (3,3), but (5,3) has obstacle at (5,2) and (5,1), but (5,3) itself is free? (5,2) is obstacle, (5,1) obstacle, (5,6) obstacle, but (5,3) not listed as obstacle, so free.\n\nBut I cannot move right now because of direction.\n\nFirst, for turn 0, possible moves:\n\nFrom (3,3), direction L.\n\nCan move U, D, L (not R).\n\nMove U: to (3,4). Is (3,4) blocked? (3,4) not listed as wall or obstacle, and not border, so free. But (3,5) is obstacle, so (3,4) is ok, but I cannot go further up to (3,5).\n\nMove D: to (3,2). (3,2) has food! And it's free, no obstacle.\n\nMove L: to (2,3). (2,3) free? Not listed as blocked, so free.\n\nMove R: not allowed, opposite direction.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), I eat the food, length becomes 2, and the tail will be at (3,3) after move? When snake moves, head moves to new position, and if no food eaten, tail moves off, but if food eaten, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move, so new tail is added at previous position or something.\n\nFrom the rules: when eating positive food, length +1, so after eating, the snake grows, so the body segments include the previous positions.\n\nInitially, snake positions: [(3,3)], so head at (3,3).\n\nIf I move to (3,2) and eat food, then new positions: head at (3,2), and the previous position becomes body, so [(3,2), (3,3)]? Or [(3,2)] and then (3,3) added as body?\n\nTypically, when moving, the head moves to new cell, and if food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new head is at new position, and the previous head becomes body, but since it was head, now it's body, and tail is same if no eat, but with eat, tail stays, so positions grow.\n\nFor example: start at S: [H]\n\nMove to new cell: if no food, [new H], but no body, so still [H] but at new position? No.\n\nSnake positions list: initially [(3,3)] , one segment.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) without eating: but there is food, so let's separate.\n\nCase 1: no food eaten. Head moves to new position, tail is removed, so positions: new head position, and body if any.\n\nBut here, no body, so if move to (3,2) and no food, it would be [(3,2)], but there is food at (3,2).\n\nWith food: if head moves to cell with food, it eats, length increases, so the new head is at food cell, and the previous positions remain, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo from [ (3,3) ], move to (3,2) with food: new positions [ (3,2), (3,3) ], head at (3,2), body at (3,3).\n\nThen length 2.\n\nIf no food, it would be just [ (3,2) ], but since no tail to move, it's the same, but position changed.\n\nBut with growth, it adds a segment.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nFor turn 0, if I move down to (3,2), I eat the food immediately, score +1, length 2, and new head at (3,2), direction down.\n\nThen, from there, I need to move next.\n\nBut I should consider other options.\n\nMove left to (2,3): no food there, so snake moves to (2,3), positions [ (2,3) ], still length 1, direction left? After move, direction changes based on action.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction is the direction of the move.\n\nSo if I move left, new direction L; move down, new direction D, etc.\n\nMove up to (3,4): no food, so [ (3,4) ], direction U.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and all food is +1, I should eat as much as possible, but avoid dying.\n\nWith only head, low risk, but after growing, body collision possible.\n\nAlso, food life span: all have life span 10, so 10 turns to eat, but since countdown includes current turn, after this turn, life span decreases to 9, etc.\n\nBut 10 turns is plenty, so not urgent.\n\nNow, let's list all free cells and food.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,3) at turn 0:\n\n- U: to (3,4) - free, no food\n\n- D: to (3,2) - food, eat\n\n- L: to (2,3) - free, no food\n\nR not allowed.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), I eat, grow to length 2, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3)\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2), direction D (since I moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction D, so opposite is U. Cannot move up.\n\nSo can move D, L, R.\n\nMove D to (3,1): is (3,1) free? Not border, not obstacle listed, so free, no food.\n\nMove L to (2,2): free? (2,2) not listed, so free, no food.\n\nMove R to (4,2): free, no food.\n\nBut there is food at (1,1) and (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is east.\n\nFrom (3,2), moving R to (4,2), then to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot go to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so from (4,2), I can go to (4,1), (4,3), (5,2) blocked, (3,2) is body, so not, but (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (5,3), from (3,2), I could go right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), but (4,3) free? Then to (5,3), but (5,3) is food, and from (4,3) to (5,3) is right.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIf at turn 0 I move left to (2,3).\n\nThen new positions [ (2,3) ], length 1, direction L.\n\nThen turn 1, from (2,3), direction L, can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nMove U to (2,4): free? (2,4) is obstacle? Obstacles include (2,4)? Yes, (2,4) is in internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, so blocked. Cannot move up to (2,4).\n\nMove D to (2,2): free, no food.\n\nMove L to (1,3): free? (1,3) not listed, so free, no food? But there is food at (1,1), not (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nIf move D to (2,2), from (2,3) down to (2,2), free.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is food, but to reach it, from (2,2), I can move left to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (1,2), so (1,2) blocked. Then to (1,1), from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1), if free, then left to (1,1).\n\n(2,1) free? Not listed as obstacle, and not border, so free. y=1, x=2, not wall.\n\nThen (2,1) to (1,1) left, but (1,1) is food, and (1,1) not blocked, but to reach (1,1), I need to be at (2,1) or (1,2), but (1,2) blocked, so only from (2,1) to (1,1).\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is left, x-1.\n\nBut (1,1) is surrounded by walls and obstacles, so once I go there, I might get stuck.\n\nLet's see neighbors of (1,1):\n\n- North: (1,2) obstacle\n\n- South: (1,0) wall (y=0)\n\n- East: (2,1) free\n\n- West: (0,1) wall\n\nSo only accessible from (2,1). And from (1,1), I can only go back to (2,1), since other directions blocked.\n\nSo if I eat food at (1,1), I go to (1,1), but then I have to go back to (2,1), and if the snake is longer, it might collide, but for now, if I go there with head only, I can eat and leave, but since I grow, after eating, I have body at previous position.\n\nFor example, if I am at (2,1), move left to (1,1) eat, then positions: head (1,1), body (2,1). Then from (1,1), I can only move back to (2,1), but (2,1) is now body, so moving there would cause collision with body, death.\n\nOh, big danger.\n\nIf I eat food at (1,1), after moving to it, head at (1,1), and body at the cell I came from, say (2,1). Then the only move is back to (2,1), which is body, so immediate collision next turn.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (1,1) is fatal if I go directly, because I get stuck and must collide.\n\nBut is there a way to eat it safely? Only if the body is not there when I move back, but since I just grew, the body is there, and I have to move, so inevitably collide.\n\nUnless I can approach from a different angle, but from (1,1), only one neighbor (2,1), so no choice.\n\nTherefore, the food at (1,1) is a trap! It's impossible to eat without dying immediately after, because the snake will be forced to collide with its own body.\n\nIs that right?\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nSuppose snake is at (2,1), length 1, positions [(2,1)].\n\nI move left to (1,1) and eat food. New positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), so [(1,1), (2,1)].\n\nNow, from (1,1), I must move. Possible moves: only to (2,1), since other directions blocked. But (2,1) is occupied by body, so moving there causes collision, death.\n\nTherefore, indeed, eating (1,1) is fatal. So I should avoid it.\n\nSimilarly, for any food in a dead end, it might be dangerous.\n\nBut in this case, (1,1) is a dead end with only one access.\n\nTherefore, I should not go for (1,1) at all.\n\nNow, food at (3,2) is safe to eat? From (3,3) down to (3,2), eat, then positions [(3,2), (3,3)].\n\nThen from (3,2), direction D.\n\nCan move: D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) — cannot move U because opposite to current D? Current direction after move is D, so opposite is U, cannot move up.\n\nSo moves: D, L, R.\n\n(3,1) free, no food.\n\n(2,2) free, no food.\n\n(4,2) free, no food.\n\nNow, food at (5,3) is at (5,3), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move R to (4,2), then from (4,2), move U to (4,3), then R to (5,3) to eat.\n\n(4,3) free? Not listed blocked.\n\n(5,3) food.\n\nBut from (4,3) to (5,3) is right.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), I grow, etc.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so from (4,2) to (4,3) is up, y+1.\n\nThen to (5,3) right.\n\nNow, back to turn 0.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,2) immediately, I could go left or up.\n\nBut up to (3,4), no food, then from there.\n\nOr left to (2,3), no food.\n\nBut food at (3,2) is easy to get, and not risky, since after eating, I have options.\n\nAlso, I need to think about long-term survival and maximizing food.\n\nThere are three food: (1,1) is trap, avoid; (3,2) is close; (5,3) is a bit far.\n\n(5,3) has obstacle at (5,2), but (5,3) itself is free.\n\nNow, another thing: since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (3,2) at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2), eat food, score=1, positions: [(3,2), (3,3)], head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nNow turn 1: from (3,2), direction D, can move D, L, R (not U).\n\n- Move D to (3,1): free, no food. New positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), so [(3,1), (3,2)]? After moving without eating, tail moves, so positions: head to new, body segments follow.\n\nWhen moving to a cell without food, the head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n\nWith food, it grows, tail stays.\n\nHere, moving to (3,1), no food, so head moves to (3,1), and since previous positions, the body moves: the tail (3,3) is removed, head to (3,1), so positions become [(3,1), (3,2)].\n\nInitially after eat: positions [ (3,2), (3,3) ], head at (3,2).\n\nMove to (3,1) no food: head moves to (3,1), tail (3,3) is removed, so new positions: [ (3,1), (3,2) ], head at (3,1), body at (3,2).\n\nDirection now D.\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (2,2): head to (2,2), tail removed, positions [ (2,2), (3,2) ], but (3,2) was head, now body, and (3,3) removed? Positions: after move, the segment that was tail is removed, so from [ (3,2), (3,3) ], move head to new cell, say (2,2), no food, then head at (2,2), and the tail (3,3) removed, so body is (3,2), so positions [ (2,2), (3,2) ].\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nNow back to turn 1 options from (3,2) with body at (3,3).\n\nMove D to (3,1): positions [ (3,1), (3,2) ]\n\nMove L to (2,2): positions [ (2,2), (3,2) ]\n\nMove R to (4,2): positions [ (4,2), (3,2) ]\n\nAll no food nearby except (5,3) which is not adjacent.\n\nNow, from here, I can plan to go to (5,3).\n\nFor example, from [ (3,1), (3,2) ] at (3,1), direction D, can move to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so (3,0) wall, cannot move down. Or left to (2,1), or right to (4,1).\n\n(2,1) free, (4,1) free? (4,1) not listed, free.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nSince (1,1) is a trap, I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nFood at (3,2) can be eaten safely at turn 0.\n\nThen I have food at (5,3) to eat.\n\nAlso, after eating (3,2), I am at (3,2) with body at (3,3).\n\nNow, to reach (5,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2), then from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3), then to (5,3).\n\n(4,2) to (4,3) is up, y+1.\n\n(4,3) to (5,3) is right.\n\n(5,3) is food, so eat at that point.\n\nBut let's see if there are obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,2) turn 1, move R to (4,2).\n\nThen positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 2: from (4,2), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L, opposite).\n\nMove U to (4,3): free, no food. Positions: head (4,3), body (4,2) — after move no eat, tail (3,2) removed, so positions [ (4,3), (4,2) ]? Head (4,3), body was (3,2), but after move, the body segments: previous head (4,2) becomes body, and tail removed, so from [ (4,2), (3,2) ], move head to (4,3) no eat, so head to (4,3), tail (3,2) removed, new positions [ (4,3), (4,2) ].\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,3), direction U, can move U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n\nMove R to (5,3): food, eat. So head to (5,3), eat, positions: head (5,3), and previous positions, so [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ], since no tail removed, growth.\n\nLength 3 now.\n\nThen score 2.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive.\n\nNow, from (5,3), with body at (4,3) and (4,2).\n\nDirection after move: since moved right to (5,3), direction R.\n\nNow possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, cannot. L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision. R to (6,3) but x=6, is it free? (6,3) not listed, but internal obstacles have (6,4) and (6,1), not (6,3), so free? But borders x=7, so (6,3) is not wall, but x=6 is not border, x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x=6 is ok.\n\n(6,3) free.\n\nSo can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nCannot move D to (5,2) obstacle, cannot move L to (4,3) body.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf move U to (5,4): free? (5,4) not listed, but obstacle at (5,6), (5,2), (5,1), not (5,4), so free. Then positions head (5,4), body (5,3) and (4,3), tail at (4,2)? Positions: after eating, [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ], move to (5,4) no food, so head to (5,4), tail (4,2) removed, new positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ].\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about other moves at turn 0.\n\nIf at turn 0 I move left to (2,3) instead.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3), no eat, positions [ (2,3) ], direction L.\n\nThen turn 1: from (2,3), direction L, can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nBut U to (2,4) is obstacle, blocked.\n\nD to (2,2): free, no food.\n\nL to (1,3): free, no food.\n\nSay move D to (2,2): positions [ (2,2) ].\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (2,2), can move to (2,1), (1,2), (3,2), but (1,2) obstacle, so (2,1), (3,2), or (2,3) but not opposite? Direction D, so opposite U, cannot move up to (2,3)? (2,3) is previous, but not necessarily opposite, opposite direction is up, since D is down, opposite U.\n\nCan move: D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, blocked, R to (3,2), U not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, but if I go to (3,2), I eat.\n\nFrom (2,2) move R to (3,2): eat food, positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ], head at (3,2), direction R? Moved right.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut I ended up eating (3,2) later, but same as eating it at turn 0, just delayed.\n\nIf I go to (2,1) first.\n\nFrom (2,2) move D to (2,1): no food, positions [ (2,1) ], direction D.\n\nThen from (2,1), can move to (2,0) but y=0 wall, or (1,1) but (1,1) food, or (3,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is trap, as we said, so not good.\n\nMove to (3,1): free, no food.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut I might miss the food if I don't eat soon.\n\nFood at (3,2) has life span 10, so I can eat later, but since it's easy, better to eat early to grow and have more flexibility.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) can be eaten.\n\nBut (1,1) should be avoided.\n\nAnother option: at turn 0, move up to (3,4).\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4), no eat, positions [ (3,4) ], direction U.\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), direction U, can move U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n\nMove U to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, blocked.\n\nMove L to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, blocked.\n\nMove R to (4,4): free? (4,4) not listed, free.\n\nSo only possible move R to (4,4).\n\nPositions [ (4,4) ], direction R.\n\nThen from (4,4), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nMove U to (4,5): free? (4,5) not listed, free.\n\nOr D to (4,3): free.\n\nOr R to (5,4): free? (5,4) free, as before.\n\nBut food at (5,3) is below, so I can go down to (4,3) then to (5,3).\n\nFor example, turn 2: from (4,4) move D to (4,3): no food, positions [ (4,3) ], direction D.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,3), direction D, can move D, L, R (not U).\n\nMove D to (4,2): free, no food.\n\nOr L to (3,3): but (3,3) might be free, but if I had eaten food, but here no, so (3,3) free.\n\nOr R to (5,3): food! So move R to (5,3) eat.\n\nThen positions [ (5,3), (4,3) ], head (5,3), direction R.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut I haven't eaten (3,2) yet.\n\n(3,2) is still there, I can go back, but life span 10, so ok.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (5,3) at turn 3, and (3,2) is uneaten.\n\nBut I can go to eat (3,2) later.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) after eating, I can move down or up, but (5,2) obstacle, so U to (5,4) or R to (6,3), etc.\n\nThen to reach (3,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut with body, it might be tight.\n\nSince I have to think long-term, and maximize score, eating both foods is possible.\n\nBut (1,1) is not eatable, so only two foods to eat: (3,2) and (5,3).\n\nNow, back to turn 0 decision.\n\nIf I eat (3,2) at turn 0, I have score 1, and can eat (5,3) by turn 2 or 3.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 0, I might eat later, but I might risk losing it if not careful, but life span 10, so low risk.\n\nBut to maximize, eating early gives me growth, which might help in maneuvering.\n\nAlso, with longer snake, I have to avoid body collision.\n\nBut for now, since grid has obstacles, growing might make it harder to move in tight spaces.\n\nBut the grid is 8x8 with some obstacles, still space.\n\nAnother point: after eating (5,3), I have to find a way out.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) with body, I can go to (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nSay to (6,3), then to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so from (6,3), can go to (6,2), (7,3), (6,4) blocked, (5,3) body.\n\n(7,3) is x=7, border wall, cannot.\n\n(6,2) free? (6,2) not listed, but obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), so (6,2) free.\n\nThen to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut I can survive.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,4), to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut no more food, so I need to find other food or just survive, but only three food, one is trap.\n\nSo maximum score is 2, eating (3,2) and (5,3).\n\nNow, to do that efficiently.\n\nAt turn 0, eating (3,2) seems good.\n\nThen go to (5,3).\n\nBut in the path I thought, from (3,2) move R to (4,2), then U to (4,3), then R to (5,3) eat.\n\nThat takes 3 turns: turn 0 to (3,2), turn 1 to (4,2), turn 2 to (4,3), turn 3 to (5,3).\n\nAt turn 3 eat (5,3).\n\nBut at turn 0 I ate (3,2).\n\nNow, if I don't eat at turn 0, I might eat both later, but similar.\n\nFor example, at turn 0 move L to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (3,2) eat at turn 2, then to (4,2), etc., same as above but delayed eating first food.\n\nSo better to eat early.\n\nAt turn 0 move U to (3,4), then to (4,4), to (4,3), to (5,3) eat at turn 3, then I can go back to (3,2) to eat, but (3,2) might be eaten by then? No, only me, and life span 10, so at turn 3, life span of (3,2) is 10 - 3 = 7 left, plenty.\n\nFrom (5,3) after eating, I can go to (4,3) but body there, or to (5,4), then to (4,4), etc., down to (4,3) is body if I came from there.\n\nSuppose after eating (5,3) at turn 3, positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ] if I came via (4,2) and (4,3).\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), positions head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), tail (4,2) removed? Move no eat, so head to (5,4), tail (4,2) removed, positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ].\n\nThen from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so not.\n\n(5,5) free, (4,4) free.\n\nSay move L to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (3,4), etc., down to (3,3), but (3,2) is below.\n\nBut (3,2) has food, I can go to it.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) to (3,4) if free, (3,4) free? Not listed blocked, but earlier (3,5) blocked, (3,4) should be free.\n\nThen to (3,3), but if I go to (3,3), it might be clear or body.\n\nAt this point, it's messy, but possible.\n\nSince (3,2) is close, better to eat it first.\n\nTherefore, at turn 0, moving down to eat (3,2) is efficient.\n\nThen head to (5,3) as planned.\n\nNow, about the direction constraint.\n\nAt turn 0, direction L, I move D to (3,2), new direction D.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2), direction D, I can move R to (4,2), which is allowed, not opposite.\n\nThen at (4,2), direction R.\n\nThen turn 2, move U to (4,3), allowed? Current direction R, moving U is not opposite, opposite would be L, but U is perpendicular, so ok.\n\nThen at (4,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 3, move R to (5,3), not opposite to U? U is up, opposite is D, R is right, so ok.\n\nEat at (5,3).\n\nThen score 2.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive, but no more food, so just avoid walls and body.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), after eating, positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ] if path was (3,2) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (5,3).\n\nAfter eating (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,2)? When moving to (5,3) with eat, head to (5,3), body remains, so from previous [ (4,3), (4,2) ], add head (5,3), so [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ].\n\nDirection after move: since moved right to (5,3), direction R.\n\nNow, as before, move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nSay move U to (5,4), no eat, positions: head (5,4), tail (4,2) removed, so [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ].\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) blocked.\n\nSay move U to (5,5), then to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, so from (5,5), can move to (5,6) blocked, or (4,5), (6,5), etc.\n\nBut no food, so I can just move around safely.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R from (5,3) to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut for the purpose, since I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format says to provide actions starting from turn t_1=0 for several turns.\n\nHow many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but in output, I need to specify actions for turns 0,1,2,... up to when?\n\nProbably, I should provide a sequence for the next few turns, at least 5, but since the game continues, I might need to stop at some point.\n\nBut in the context, I think I should plan for the path to eat the foods and then survive.\n\nSince after eating both, no more food, survival is key.\n\nBut for now, with the information, I can output for turns 0 to, say, 4 or 5.\n\nBut at turn 0, I move D to eat (3,2).\n\nThen turn 1, move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 2, move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3, move R to (5,3) eat\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,3), move U to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut let's specify.\n\nAlso, ensure no collisions.\n\nIn this path, all moves are safe.\n\nAt turn 3, after moving to (5,3), I eat, so positions grow.\n\nThen turn 4, I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), or R to (6,3), since D to (5,2) obstacle, L to (4,3) body.\n\n(4,3) is body, yes.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nSay I choose U to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 5, from (5,4), can move to (5,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I can output up to turn 5 or so.\n\nNow, what about the other food (1,1)? We decided to avoid it.\n\nBut is there any other food? Only three, and (1,1) not eatable.\n\nSo maximum score 2.\n\nNow, another possibility: at turn 0, instead of moving down, I move left to (2,3), but then I might not eat (3,2) immediately, but I can eat later, but it might be less efficient or riskier.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (3,2) eat at turn 2, then same as before to (4,2) etc., but I eat (3,2) later, and (5,3) later, so same score, but turns delayed.\n\nSince life span, not critical.\n\nBut with early growth, I have more body to manage, but in this case, with length 1, it's easier to move, but after eating, same.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nTherefore, I think moving down at turn 0 is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions:\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) eat food.\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2), move R to (4,2) no food.\n\nTurn 2: from (4,2), move U to (4,3) no food.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) eat food.\n\nNow, for turn 4 and beyond, I need to move safely.\n\nAfter turn 3, positions: after eating (5,3), head at (5,3), body at (4,3) and (4,2)? From the move: at turn 2, after moving to (4,3), positions: let's trace.\n\nStart turn 0: positions [ (3,3) ]\n\nAction D to (3,2) eat: positions [ (3,2), (3,3) ]\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2) no eat: head to (4,2), tail (3,3) removed, so positions [ (4,2), (3,2) ]\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) no eat: head to (4,3), tail (3,2) removed, so positions [ (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3) eat: head to (5,3), no tail removed, body remains, so positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 4: possible moves: U to (5,4), or R to (6,3), not D (obstacle), not L (body).\n\nSay move U to (5,4): no food, head to (5,4), tail (4,2) removed, so positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,4), direction U, can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) blocked (obstacle), not D (opposite).\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSay move U to (5,5): no food, positions head (5,5), tail (4,3) removed, so [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I can output for turns 0 to 5.\n\nIn the answer, I need to write actions.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, since I planned to eat both, and I have actions up to turn 3 for eating, then survival.\n\nBut the answer format might expect actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nSo turns 0 to 4 or 0 to 5.\n\nLet me list:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nThen turn 4: U (or R, but I chose U)\n\nTurn 5: U or L, say U for simplicity.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince after turn 3, I need to avoid dead ends, but here it's fine.\n\nAnother point: at turn 2, I moved U to (4,3), but (4,3) is above, and (3,3) was previous, but not occupied now.\n\nAll safe.\n\nI think this is a good plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nFor turn 4, I need to specify, say U.\n\nThen turn 5, say U to (5,5), but (5,5) is free, and (5,6) obstacle, but I can move later.\n\nBut since no food, it's ok.\n\nTo be consistent, I can output up to turn 5.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is a better first move.\n\nSuppose at turn 0, I move up to (3,4), then as before, I go to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (5,3) eat at turn 3, but I haven't eaten (3,2), so I need to go back.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,3) at turn 3, I am at (5,3), then I can go to (5,4), then to (4,4), to (3,4), to (3,3), but (3,3) free, then to (3,2) eat at turn 7 or something.\n\nBut at turn 3, positions after eating (5,3): depending on path.\n\nIf from (3,4) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (5,3), after eating, positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]? Let's not complicate.\n\nBut I eat (3,2) later, but same score, and more turns, so not better.\n\nTherefore, eating (3,2) first is better.\n\nSo I think initial plan is fine.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 0: D (down)\n\nTurn 1: R (right)\n\nTurn 2: U (up)\n\nTurn 3: R (right)\n\nThen for turn 4, from (5,3), move U (up) to (5,4)\n\nTurn 5, from (5,4), move U (up) to (5,5), if possible, but (5,5) free, yes.\n\nTo avoid (5,6) obstacle, but I can turn later.\n\nSince the answer should be in the format.\n\nI think this works.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I need to plan a sequence of moves that safely eats the positive food at (3,2) and (5,3), avoiding the dangerous food at (1,1) which is a dead end and would cause immediate collision after eating. The snake starts at (3,3) with direction left, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. All food has a life span of 10, so there is no urgency, but eating early allows growth for better maneuverability.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Avoid (1,1)**: This food is in a dead end (only accessible from (2,1), and eating it would trap the snake, causing collision on the next move.\n- **Eat (3,2) first**: It is directly below the starting position and can be eaten safely on turn 0, growing the snake to length 2. This provides more flexibility for future moves.\n- **Eat (5,3) next**: After eating (3,2), move right and up to reach (5,3) by turn 3. This path avoids obstacles and body collisions.\n- **Survival after eating both**: After consuming both foods, focus on moving to open areas to avoid walls, obstacles, and self-collision. The sequence below plans 6 turns ahead (turns 0 to 5) to ensure safety and demonstrate long-term thinking.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 0 to 5):\n- **Turn 0**: Move down (D) to (3,2) to eat the food (+1 score, length=2). New head position: (3,2), direction: down. Body segment at (3,3).  \n- **Turn 1**: Move right (R) to (4,2). No food, so tail moves off. New head position: (4,2), direction: right. Positions: [(4,2), (3,2)].  \n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to (4,3). No food, so tail moves off. New head position: (4,3), direction: up. Positions: [(4,3), (4,2)].  \n- **Turn 3**: Move right (R) to (5,3) to eat the food (+1 score, length=3). New head position: (5,3), direction: right. Positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)].  \n- **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to (5,4). No food, so tail moves off. New head position: (5,4), direction: up. Positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]. This move avoids the obstacle at (5,2) and body at (4,3).  \n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to (5,5). No food, so tail moves off. New head position: (5,5), direction: up. Positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]. This move continues upward into open space, away from obstacles and the body.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Safety**: The path avoids all walls, obstacles, and body collisions. For example:\n  - Turn 4 avoids moving down (to obstacle (5,2)) or left (to body at (4,3)).\n  - Turn 5 avoids moving right (to (6,4), which is an obstacle) or down (opposite direction).\n- **Efficiency**: Eats both safe foods by turn 3, maximizing score early. (1,1) is ignored as it is a trap.\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 5, the snake can continue moving safely (e.g., to (4,5) or (5,6), but (5,6) is an obstacle, so (4,5) is better). The open area around (5,5) provides room to maneuver without immediate risks.\n- **Direction constraints**: All moves respect the \"no instant reverse\" rule (e.g., after moving down on turn 0, up is not allowed on turn 1; after moving right on turn 1, left is not allowed on turn 2, etc.).\n\nThis plan achieves the maximum possible score of 2 in this state and ensures survival for at least 5+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: D (down)  \nTurn 1: R (right)  \nTurn 2: U (up)  \nTurn 3: R (right)  \nTurn 4: U (up)  \nTurn 5: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x coordinates from 0 to 7 inclusive, but 0 and 7 are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Therefore, the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). That's a 6x6 area.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n\nSnake positions: head is (3,2), then body is (3,3). So snake has length 2, head at (3,2), tail at (3,3). Head direction is down, which is D. Since direction is D, moving down means increasing y? Let's clarify coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, but here it says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). That suggests that y increases upwards? Let's see:\n\nU: (x,y+1) — up, so y increases as we go up? But in standard computer graphics, y often increases downward. Here it says U (x,y+1), so if U is up, that means y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom? That might be confusing.\n\nLook: U (x,y+1) — up, so moving up increases y.\n\nD (x,y-1) — down, decreases y.\n\nL (x-1,y) — left, decreases x.\n\nR (x+1,y) — right, increases x.\n\nAlso, walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Since D is (x,y-1), moving down decreases y, so y=0 is the bottom row, and y=7 is the top row? Let's think.\n\nIf moving down decreases y, that means lower y values are down. So y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top. Similarly, x=0 is left, x=7 is right.\n\nBut walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So for example, (0,0) is bottom-left corner, but it's a wall. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 is bottom wall, so y=1 is the bottom row of playable area, y=6 is the top? Since y=7 is top wall.\n\ny=0: bottom wall, y=7: top wall. Moving down to y-1, so from y=1, down would be to y=0, which is wall, so invalid. Similarly, up to y+1, from y=6, up to y=7, wall.\n\nSo playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. So cells (1,1) to (6,6). (1,1) is bottom-left? Since y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top.\n\nIn coordinates: (x,y), with x increasing right, y increasing up? From the movement:\n\nU: (x,y+1) — up\n\nD: (x,y-1) — down\n\nSo y increases upwards, so (1,1) is the bottom-left playable cell, (1,6) is top-left, (6,1) bottom-right, (6,6) top-right.\n\nYes.\n\nNow snake positions: [(3,2), (3,3)]\n\nHead is (3,2), body is (3,3). Since head direction is D, down. Down is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y. Current head at (3,2), which is y=2. Moving down would go to (3,1), since y-1=1.\n\nBut y=1 is playable, yes.\n\nHead direction D, meaning it just moved down to (3,2)? Let's see the positions: snake positions are head first, so (3,2) is head, (3,3) is tail. Direction is D, down, so it must have come from above, meaning from (3,3) to (3,2) by moving down? But (3,3) to (3,2) is decreasing y, so down, yes.\n\nNow, since it moved down to (3,2), and direction is D, so for the next move, it can't do instant reverse, which would be up (U), since U is opposite of D.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2): head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nCan move: D again? Down to (3,1)\n\nOr L: left to (2,2)\n\nOr R: right to (4,2)\n\nCannot move U, because instant reverse not allowed.\n\nNow, food:\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 9? It says: (1,1,9,1) — I think this is (x,y,life_span,value)\n\nIn the state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1,1,9,1) - (5,3,9,1) - (4,1,10,1)\"\n\nSo for (1,1): x=1,y=1, life_span=9, value=1\n\nSimilarly, (5,3): x=5,y=3, life_span=9, value=1\n\n(4,1): x=4,y=1, life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll positive food, since value=1, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1, so for (1,1), life_span=9, so it will disappear after turn 9, meaning it exists for 9 turns starting from now? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn 1, life_span=9, then turn 2, it becomes 8, and so on, until turn 9 it becomes 0 and disappears? Or after turn N it disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, so after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, a food has life_span L. After this turn, at the start of turn t+1, life_span becomes L-1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it means: at the beginning of turn t, the food has life_span S. During turn t, if the snake moves to it, it can be eaten. Then, after turn t, the life_span decreases by 1. When life_span becomes 0, after the decrease, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 1, life_span=9 for (1,1). After turn 1, life_span becomes 8. After turn 2, 7, ..., after turn 8, it becomes 1, then after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it exists from turn 1 to turn 9 inclusive? After turn 9 it disappears, so during turn 9 it can still be eaten, but not after.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, (1,1) life_span=9, (5,3) life_span=9, (4,1) life_span=10.\n\nAll value=1, so positive food.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nPlayable area: x 1-6, y 1-6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nList them:\n\n(6,4) — wall\n\n(5,1) — wall\n\n(2,4) — wall\n\n(6,1) — wall\n\n(1,2) — wall\n\n(5,6) — wall\n\n(5,2) — wall\n\n(3,5) — wall\n\nAnd borders, but borders are already walls.\n\nNow snake: head (3,2), tail (3,3). So the snake is vertical, head at bottom, tail above, since y=2 and y=3, and y increases up, so (3,2) is below (3,3). Head at lower y.\n\nSince direction is D, down, so it's facing down.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2):\n\n- D: down to (3,1)\n\n- L: left to (2,2)\n\n- R: right to (4,2)\n\nCannot go up to (3,3) because that's the tail, but moving to tail is allowed only if tail moves away, but in this case, since snake length is 2, if it moves down to (3,1), then tail moves from (3,3) to where head was, (3,2), so new positions: head (3,1), body (3,2). Tail is now (3,2).\n\nIf it moves left to (2,2), head (2,2), body (3,2)? Positions: after move, head moves to new position, body follows, so if head to (2,2), then the body segment which was at (3,3) moves to where head was, (3,2). So new snake: [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nSimilarly, if right to (4,2), [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nNow, food at (1,1), (5,3), (4,1)\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left, (4,1) is bottom, x=4,y=1, (5,3) is x=5,y=3.\n\nI need to think about paths and risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate moves.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is empty? Let's see if it's safe.\n\n(3,1) is not a wall, not occupied by snake (snake is at (3,2) and (3,3)), no food there, so moving to (3,1) is safe, but no food eaten.\n\nThen after that, snake at [(3,1), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction would be D (since moved down).\n\nThen from there, can move D, L, R? (3,1), y=1, so D down to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot move D. Can move L to (2,1), R to (4,1), or U to (3,2), but (3,2) is now the body, so moving there would cause collision? (3,2) is the body segment, so if head moves to (3,2), it collides with body, death.\n\nPositions: after move to (3,1), snake is [(3,1), (3,2)], so (3,2) is the tail.\n\nIf next move U to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by the tail. Now, when moving, the head moves first, then tail moves. So if head moves to (3,2), which is occupied by the tail, but at that moment, the tail is still at (3,2), so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nUnless the tail moves away at the same time, but in snake, movement is sequential: head moves to new cell, then each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment. So when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied, it collides.\n\nSpecifically, for the tail: if head moves to the tail cell, and the tail is moving away, but since the tail moves after the head, when head moves to the tail cell, the tail is still there, so collision. Only if the tail is about to move, but in the sequence, head moves first.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nImportant: you can move to the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n\nSo in this case, if snake is at [(3,1), (3,2)], and head moves U to (3,2), which is current tail position. But since the tail will move to where the head was (which is (3,1)), so after move, head is at (3,2), tail is at (3,1), no collision. Because the tail vacates the cell.\n\nSimilarly, in general, moving to the current tail position is safe because tail moves.\n\nBut moving to other body segments is not safe.\n\nIn this case, for (3,1), moving U to (3,2) is possible and safe, since it's the tail.\n\nSimilarly, from current position (3,2), if it could move U to (3,3), which is tail, it should be safe, but it cannot because instant reverse not allowed. Direction is D, U is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nBut in option D to (3,1), then from there, can move U to (3,2), which is safe.\n\nBack to moves from (3,2).\n\nOption D: to (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is free, no food, so just move, no eat.\n\nThen snake at [(3,1), (3,2)]\n\nOption L: to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) is not wall? Walls: internal obstacles, (1,2) is wall, but (2,2) is not listed, so free. Snake not there, no food, so safe move.\n\nThen snake at [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nOption R: to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) not wall? Internal obstacles: (5,2) is wall, but (4,2) not listed, so free. No food, safe.\n\nSnake at [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nNow, food: (1,1) is at bottom-left, (4,1) is bottom, x=4,y=1, (5,3) is x=5,y=3.\n\n(4,1) has food, value 1.\n\nIf I move R to (4,2), then I am at (4,2), and food is at (4,1), so I can move down to (4,1) next turn to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,1), I am at (3,1), and (4,1) is adjacent, I can move R to (4,1) to eat, or L to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,3), which has no food, so no issue.\n\nFood at (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), none under snake.\n\n(4,1) is food, but snake is at (3,2) and (3,3), not on (4,1).\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, life span: all food have high life span, 9 or 10, so no urgency to eat immediately.\n\nBut since I need to maximize score, I should eat when possible.\n\nNow, let's consider paths.\n\nFirst, if I move R to (4,2) now.\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,2), tail (3,2)? Positions: after move, head to (4,2), body from (3,3) to where head was, (3,2). So snake: [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,2), can move to eat (4,1) by moving D down to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is free? Is it wall? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is wall, (6,1) wall, but (4,1) not listed, so free. And it has food.\n\nMove D to (4,1): head moves to (4,1), eats food, since food there. Value +1, snake grows, so after eating, new head at (4,1), and tail doesn't move? When eating, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so the tail stays, new segment added.\n\nSequence: head moves to new cell, if food, eat and grow, so tail doesn't move. If no food, tail moves to next position.\n\nSo here: head at (4,2), move to (4,1). (4,1) has food, so eat, head now at (4,1), body still at (3,2), but since grow, a new segment is added at the end? The tail doesn't move, so snake becomes: head (4,1), then previous body (3,2), and since grow, the tail position stays, so segments: [(4,1), (4,2)? No.\n\nInitial positions before move: [(4,2), (3,2)] head (4,2), body (3,2).\n\nMove head to (4,1). Since (4,1) has food, eat it, so the head moves to (4,1), and the body segments remain, but a new segment is added at the tail? Or the tail doesn't move.\n\nTypically in snake, when eat, head moves to new cell, the body follows but the tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: after move and eat, head at (4,1), then the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,2), and the tail (3,2) stays? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: positions [head, body] = [A, B] where A is head, B is tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell C: if no food, then new head C, and tail moves away from B, so new positions [C, A]\n\nIf food at C, eat, then new head C, and tail stays, so new positions [C, A, B] or [C, A] and B remains? B is the tail position.\n\nStandard: the snake body segments: when head moves to C, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move to C: new head C, then B1 moves to H, B2 moves to B1, ..., T moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nBut when eating, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nEasier: when head moves to a cell:\n\n- If no food, tail is removed (but since it moves, the cell is vacated)\n\n- If food, tail is not removed, so snake grows by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions P = [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n\nHead moves to new position Q.\n\nThen, if no food, new positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., P{k-1}]  so tail Pk is removed.\n\nIf food, new positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., Pk]  so tail Pk remains, and new segment added? [Q, P0, P1, ..., Pk] means length increased by one, with Pk still there.\n\nFor example, current: [ (4,2), (3,2) ] head (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nMove head to (4,1). Food at (4,1), so eat.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,1), then the previous head (4,2) becomes body, and the tail (3,2) remains, so snake: [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2) ]\n\nYes, length 3.\n\nIf no food, it would be [ (4,1), (4,2) ], tail at (4,2).\n\nBack to plan.\n\nSo if I move R to (4,2) at turn 1.\n\nThen turn 2, from (4,2), move D to (4,1), eat food, snake grows to length 3: positions [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow, from (4,1), possible moves: U up to (4,2), but (4,2) is now body, so if I move there, collision? (4,2) is occupied by body.\n\nCan I move to it? Since it's not tail, it's body, so collision.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is body, not tail. Moving to (4,2) would be collision.\n\nOther moves: L left to (3,1), or R right to (5,1), or D down to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1)\n\n(5,1) is wall? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is wall, yes, listed. So cannot move R.\n\nL to (3,1): (3,1) is free? Not wall, not occupied, no food, so safe.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) and eating, head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 2 action done.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,1), can move L to (3,1) or U to (4,2) but U to (4,2) is body, collision, not allowed. Or D invalid. So only L to (3,1).\n\nMove to (3,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (3,1), body from (4,2) to (4,1)? Positions: before move, [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2) ]\n\nHead moves to (3,1). No food at (3,1), so after move, head at (3,1), then body moves: the first body segment (4,2) moves to where head was (4,1), and tail (3,2) moves to where the previous segment was, which is (4,2)? Since the segment that was at (4,2) moves to (4,1), and the segment at (3,2) moves to (4,2).\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nHead at (3,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nHead direction L (since moved left from (4,1) to (3,1)).\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves: U up to (3,2), but (3,2) is not occupied? Current positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), so (3,2) is free? Yes, no one there.\n\n(3,2) is empty now.\n\nOr L left to (2,1), or R right to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision.\n\nOr D down to (3,0) wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible U to (3,2) or L to (2,1)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; we need to plan from current.\n\nBack to turn 1 choices.\n\nIf I move R to (4,2), I can quickly eat (4,1) on turn 2.\n\nBut after that, I'm at (4,1) with snake around, and only move left to (3,1), which might not be bad.\n\nOther options.\n\nMove D to (3,1) now at turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,1)\n\nNo food, so snake: head to (3,1), body to (3,2), so [(3,1), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 2: from (3,1), can move L to (2,1), R to (4,1), or U to (3,2) which is tail, so safe.\n\nIf I move R to (4,1), I can eat the food there.\n\nMove to (4,1), eat, grow: head at (4,1), body at (3,1), and since grow, tail stays? Positions before move: [(3,1), (3,2)] head (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nMove head to (4,1), food, eat. New positions: head (4,1), then previous head (3,1) becomes body, and tail (3,2) remains, so [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nThen from (4,1), same as previous situation.\n\nMove L to (2,1) from (3,1), or U.\n\nBut (2,1) might lead to (1,1) food.\n\nMove L to (3,2) from (3,1), but (3,2) is tail, safe, but no food.\n\nNow, third option: move L to (2,2) at turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2)\n\nNo food, snake: [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but (1,2) is wall? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is listed, so wall, cannot move L.\n\nR to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision? Positions: [(2,2), (3,2)], so (3,2) is tail? Since only two segments, (3,2) is tail.\n\nMove to tail is safe.\n\nSo can move U to (2,3), D to (2,1), or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,1) has no food, but (1,1) has food below.\n\nMove D to (2,1): no food, so snake moves to [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nThen from there, can move to (1,1) to eat, but (1,1) is adjacent left? From (2,1), L to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is not wall, has food.\n\nBut (1,1) is at corner, might be risky.\n\nNow, to think long-term, I should consider the food locations and paths.\n\nFood at (1,1), (4,1), (5,3)\n\n(4,1) is close to current position.\n\n(5,3) is at y=3, which is higher.\n\nSince snake is short, eating food increases length, which might make it harder to maneuver, but I need to eat to score.\n\nAlso, obstacles: many in the area.\n\nList all obstacles for clarity.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7\n\nInternal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo grid:\n\ny=6: top row. Cells: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) wall, (6,6)\n\n(5,6) wall, so (5,6) blocked.\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) wall, (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\n(3,5) wall.\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4) wall, (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) wall\n\n(2,4) and (6,4) walls.\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — but snake tail is at (3,3) now, but it will move, so cell is occupied but will be free if snake moves.\n\nAt turn 1, snake at (3,2) and (3,3), so (3,3) occupied.\n\n(4,3), (5,3) food, (6,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2) wall, (2,2), (3,2) snake head, (4,2), (5,2) wall, (6,2)\n\n(1,2) wall, (5,2) wall.\n\ny=1: (1,1) food, (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) food, (5,1) wall, (6,1) wall\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) walls, so (4,1) is at bottom, with wall to right.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has wall above at (1,2).\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I should avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the bottom row y=1 has few free cells: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) but (5,1) and (6,1) walls, so only up to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, left side.\n\nBut with snake growing, it might get trapped.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat immediately, but that means no score, and food might disappear later, but life span long, so I can eat later.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat when possible, but with planning.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,3), which is higher up, less cluttered.\n\nBut to reach (5,3), from current (3,2), I could move up, but I can't because direction D, cannot move U instantly.\n\nSo I need to move sideways first.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, possible sequences.\n\nOption A: Move R to (4,2) at turn 1.\n\nThen turn 2: move D to (4,1), eat food, snake grows to length 3: positions [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow turn 3: from (4,1), can only move L to (3,1) (since U to (4,2) body, R to (5,1) wall, D invalid).\n\nMove to (3,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (3,1), body (4,2) moves to (4,1)? Positions before: [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2) ]\n\nHead to (3,1), no food, so new head (3,1), then body: (4,1) moves to where? The first body segment at (4,2) moves to previous head position (4,1), and the tail at (3,2) moves to (4,2).\n\nNew positions: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nHead at (3,1), direction L (moved left).\n\nTurn 4: from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), L to (2,1), R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision.\n\nD invalid.\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is free? Currently occupied? Positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), so (3,2) is free, yes.\n\nL to (2,1): (2,1) free.\n\nSo can move U or L.\n\nIf move U to (3,2), no food, then snake: head to (3,2), body (4,1) moves to (3,1), tail (4,2) moves to (4,1), so new [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from there, can move U to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach other food.\n\nFrom (3,1) at turn 4, if I move L to (2,1), no food, then snake: head (2,1), body (4,1) moves to (3,1), tail (4,2) moves to (4,1)? Positions before: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nHead to (2,1), no food, new head (2,1), body (4,1) moves to (3,1), tail (4,2) moves to (4,1), so new [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (2,1), can move L to (1,1) to eat food, or U to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) has food, so if move to (1,1), eat, grow.\n\nBut (1,1) is corner, might be dangerous.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, when moving to (1,1), the tail is at (4,1), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nBut after eating, snake longer, in corner.\n\nThen from (1,1), can only move U to (1,2) but (1,2) is wall, or R to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, so only U or R, both invalid or collision, so death.\n\n(1,1): possible moves: U to (1,2) but (1,2) wall, invalid. R to (2,1), which is body, collision. D to (1,0) wall. L to (0,1) wall. So no moves, death.\n\nSo if I eat (1,1), I die immediately after.\n\nTherefore, I should not eat (1,1) when in the corner with no escape.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,1), after eating, I could move to (3,1) but then I might be forced towards (1,1) or up.\n\nIn the sequence above, after eating (4,1) and moving to (3,1), I have options.\n\nBut to avoid (1,1) trap.\n\nNow, option B: move D to (3,1) at turn 1.\n\nThen turn 1: to (3,1), no food, snake [(3,1), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,1), can move R to (4,1) to eat, or L to (2,1), or U to (3,2) tail safe.\n\nIf move R to (4,1), eat, then snake [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] as before.\n\nThen same as option A after eating.\n\nIf from (3,1) move U to (3,2), no food, snake [(3,2), (3,1)]? Positions before: [(3,1), (3,2)] head (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nMove U to (3,2), which is tail, so safe. Since moving to tail, no collision.\n\nAfter move, head at (3,2), tail moves to (3,1), so new positions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from (3,2), now at turn 2, snake head (3,2), body (3,1), direction U.\n\nCan move U to (3,3), but (3,3) is free? At turn 1, tail was at (3,3), but after moving to (3,1), tail moved to (3,2)? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 1 start: snake [(3,2), (3,3)] head (3,2) direction D.\n\nMove D to (3,1): head to (3,1), no food, so body (3,3) moves to (3,2), so new snake [(3,1), (3,2)] with head (3,1) direction D.\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (3,2), which is current position of the body. (3,2) is occupied by the body segment.\n\nSince it's not the tail, moving to it would cause collision.\n\nPositions: [(3,1), (3,2)] head (3,1), body (3,2) is the tail? Only two segments, so (3,2) is the tail.\n\nIn [(3,1), (3,2)], (3,1) is head, (3,2) is tail.\n\nSo moving to (3,2) is moving to tail, safe.\n\nAfter move, head to (3,2), tail moves to (3,1), so new snake [(3,2), (3,1)] head (3,2) direction U.\n\nThen from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\n(3,3) is free, no food.\n\nMove U to (3,3), no food, snake grows? No, no food, so move to (3,3), head (3,3), body (3,1) moves to (3,2), so new [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen can go up or sideways.\n\nBut no food eaten yet.\n\nCoption: move L to (2,2) at turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: to (2,2), no food, snake [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2), can move U to (2,3), D to (2,1), or R to (3,2) tail safe.\n\nIf move D to (2,1), no food, snake [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,1), can move L to (1,1) to eat, but as before, eating (1,1) leads to death.\n\nOr U to (2,2) which is body, collision if not tail.\n\nPositions: [(2,1), (2,2)] head (2,1), tail (2,2)? Only two, so tail is (2,2), so moving to (2,2) is safe.\n\nMove U to (2,2), safe, but no progress.\n\nOr move L to (1,1) to eat, but death.\n\nSo better not to go to (2,1) if I can avoid eating (1,1) when trapped.\n\nFrom (2,2), move U to (2,3) instead.\n\n(2,3) free, no food.\n\nSnake [(2,3), (2,2)] after move.\n\nThen from there, can go to (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, invalid, or L to (1,3), or R to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) might be accessible.\n\nTo reach (5,3) food.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nFrom current position (3,2), I can move R to (4,2), then from there, instead of down to (4,1), I could move U to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut at (4,2), after turn 1 move R.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2) but (3,2) is tail, safe, or R to (5,2) but (5,2) wall.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), no food, snake [(4,3), (4,2)]? Positions: after move to (4,2), snake [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nMove U to (4,3): head to (4,3), no food, so body (3,2) moves to (4,2), new snake [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from (4,3), can move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3) which has food.\n\n(5,3) has food, so move R to (5,3), eat, grow.\n\nBut (5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nIs it safe to move to (5,3)?\n\n(5,3) not wall, food there.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows to length 3: positions before move: [(4,3), (4,2)] head (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nMove to (5,3), eat, so new head (5,3), body (4,2) moves to (4,3)? New positions: head (5,3), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, tail (4,2) remains, so [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, L to (4,3) body collision, R to (6,3) but (6,3) not wall? Internal obstacles: (6,4) wall, (6,1) wall, but (6,3) not listed, so free?

Internal obstacles: (6,1) wall, but (6,2) not listed, so free.\n\nMove D to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut life span of food: (5,3) has life span 9, so it will last until turn 9, current turn 1, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) has life span 10, (1,1) life span 9.\n\nNo rush.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner might allow eating more later, but with risk.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,3), I have more space to move.\n\nNow, compare to eating (4,1) first: if I eat (4,1) on turn 2, then I'm at bottom with longer snake, and fewer moves, as earlier.\n\nSo perhaps better to go for (5,3).\n\nBut to go to (4,3), I need to move from (3,2) to (4,2), then to (4,3).\n\nBut from (3,2), I can also move D to (3,1), but that might not help to reach (5,3).\n\nMove L to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (3,3), etc., but longer to reach (5,3).\n\nSo moving R first is better for reaching (5,3).\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) might be eaten later, or not.\n\nBut life span 10, so ok.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: not immediate.\n\nSo for turn 1, I think move R to (4,2) is good.\n\nThen for turn 2, move U to (4,3) to set up for (5,3).\n\nThen turn 3 move R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen after that, I can decide next moves.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to list actions for several turns, at least 5? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is to list actions starting from turn t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" means in reasoning, but output can be for as many turns as I decide, but probably for the immediate future.\n\nSince the state changes, I need to plan a sequence.\n\nBut I can plan a path.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,3), I have food at (1,1) and (4,1) still available.\n\n(4,1) might be reachable from below.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nHead at (5,3).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), or R to (6,3), since L to (4,3) body, D to (5,2) wall.\n\n(5,4) is free? y=4, x=5, not wall, no obstacle listed, so free.\n\n(6,3) free.\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), then from (6,3), can move D to (6,2) or U to (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so only D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is free, then from (6,2), can move L to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or D to (6,1) wall, or R to (7,2) wall, or U to (6,3) body.\n\nOnly possible if snake short, but after moving, if at (6,3), move D to (6,2), no food, snake moves to [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]? Positions before: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] head (5,3)\n\nMove to (6,3): no food? (6,3) no food, so head to (6,3), body (4,3) moves to (5,3), tail (4,2) moves to (4,3), so new [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nThen move D to (6,2): head to (6,2), no food, so body (5,3) moves to (6,3), tail (4,3) moves to (5,3), new [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3) body, L to (5,2) wall, D to (6,1) wall, R invalid, so stuck, only U to (6,3) but body, collision, death.\n\nOh, dead end.\n\nSo moving to (6,3) is dangerous.\n\nBetter to move U to (5,4) from (5,3).\n\n(5,4) free, move U to (5,4), no food, snake moves: head to (5,4), body (4,3) moves to (5,3), tail (4,2) moves to (4,3), so new [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) wall, or D to (5,3) body.\n\nSo move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\n(5,5) free, (4,4) free.\n\nEtc. Better.\n\nSo from (5,3), moving U to (5,4) is safer.\n\nThen I can explore the upper area.\n\nNow back to turn 1.\n\nI think for turn 1, moving R to (4,2) is best to set up for (5,3).\n\nThen turn 2 move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3 move R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen for later turns, I can decide based on state.\n\nBut since I need to output actions, I can plan a few turns.\n\nAlso, the other food (4,1) can be eaten later if possible, or ignored if risky.\n\n(1,1) is risky to eat.\n\nSo for now, plan to eat (5,3) on turn 3.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 1: R (right)\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,2), move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nNow, what about turn 4 and beyond?\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] as before.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) as safer.\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (5,4)\n\nNo food, so snake moves: head to (5,4), body (4,3) moves to (5,3), tail (4,2) moves to (4,3), so new [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), or L to (4,4), or R to (6,4) wall, D to (5,3) body.\n\nSo move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\n(5,5) free, (4,4) free.\n\nI can move L to (4,4) to go left, or U to go up.\n\nSince (1,1) and (4,1) food below, but might be risky with longer snake.\n\n(4,1) life span 10, so can eat later.\n\nSimilarly, I could head towards the left area.\n\nBut for now, let's say move U to (5,5) for example.\n\nBut I need to output 5 turns? Since think 5 ahead, but output can be for 5 turns or more.\n\nThe answer format says to list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but doesn't specify how many.\n\nI think I should list at least until after eating or something.\n\nSince the state changes, I can list for the first few critical moves.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 1 to turn 5.\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R (eat at (5,3))\n\nTurn 4: U (to (5,4))\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), say move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nTo be specific, move U to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is free.\n\nNow, what about the direction constraints.\n\nIn turn 1, move R, head direction becomes R.\n\nTurn 2, move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 3, move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 4, move U, direction U.\n\nAll fine, no instant reverse.\n\nNow, for the other option, if I had moved D first, it might lead to bottom.\n\nBut I think R then U is better.\n\nMove L to (2,2) first, then I can go to (2,3), but (2,4) wall, so to (1,3) or (3,3), but slower to reach (5,3).\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nTherefore, I think move R at turn 1.\n\nThen U at turn 2.\n\nR at turn 3 to eat.\n\nThen U at turn 4.\n\nThen for turn 5, from (5,4), move U to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is y=5, x=5.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nSince the food at (4,1) is still there, I might plan to eat it later, but with longer snake, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), if I move down, but direction U, so moving D would be reverse, not allowed instantly.\n\nAfter moving U to (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen to go down, I need to move sideways first.\n\nBut not necessary now.\n\nI think the sequence is reasonable.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U (to (5,5))\n\nBut turn 5 to (5,5) is fine.\n\nTo connect to other areas.\n\nSince I have to output, I'll go with this.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 3, when I move R to (5,3), I eat, good.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body: not here.\n\nSo I think ok.\n\nSo for answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 1: R Turn 2: U Turn 3: R Turn 4: U Turn 5: U }\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1.\n\nTurn 1: action\n\nTurn 2: action\n\netc.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 3 I eat (5,3).\n\nThen turn 4 move U to (5,4), turn 5 move U to (5,5).\n\nBut at (5,5), I can move to (5,6) but (5,6) wall, so not, or to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut for now, it's fine.\n\nI could stop after turn 4, but since I thought 5 ahead, list 5 turns.\n\nPerhaps list until after eating.\n\nBut I think 5 actions are ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Current State**: Snake head at (3,2) with direction down (D). Possible moves from (3,2) are down (D) to (3,1), left (L) to (2,2), or right (R) to (4,2). Up (U) is invalid due to instant reverse prevention.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (5,3) is a high-value target (value +1) with a life span of 9, meaning it disappears after turn 9. It is safer to eat than (1,1) or (4,1) because it is not in a corner, reducing trap risks after growth.\n  - (4,1) has a longer life span (10 turns) and can be eaten later if feasible. (1,1) is risky due to corner positioning and should be avoided.\n- **Path Safety**: \n  - Moving right (R) on turn 1 positions the snake to reach (5,3) efficiently while avoiding immediate dangers.\n  - After eating (5,3) on turn 3, moving up (U) on turns 4 and 5 explores the upper grid for future food opportunities and avoids dead ends (e.g., the bottom row with obstacles).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - No food is under the snake's body or tail, so tail reward danger is not a concern.\n  - Wall and body collisions are avoided by steering clear of obstacles (e.g., (5,2) and (6,4)) and not moving into body segments.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - By eating (5,3) early, the snake grows to length 3, increasing its ability to control space. The sequence avoids the bottom-left corner (risky for (1,1)) and focuses on the more open upper grid for flexibility.\n  - After turn 5, the snake can reassess to target remaining food (e.g., (4,1)) or new spawns, ensuring sustained scoring.\n\n### Planned Moves (5 Turns)\n- **Turn 1**: Move right (R) to (4,2). This sets up a path to (5,3) and avoids the riskier bottom row. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to (4,3). This positions the snake to approach (5,3) directly. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 3**: Move right (R) to (5,3), eating the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 3). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to (5,4). This moves away from the bottom obstacles and towards safer areas. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to (5,5). This continues exploration of the upper grid, where fewer walls and obstacles allow more maneuvering room for future turns.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 by turn 3, avoids all collisions and dead ends, and maintains options for eating (4,1) later if accessible (e.g., by looping down after changing direction).\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 1: R \\newline Turn 2: U \\newline Turn 3: R \\newline Turn 4: U \\newline Turn 5: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,2), and the body is at (3,2). Since there are only two segments, the snake is of length 2. Head direction is right, so it was moving to the right to get to (4,2) from (3,2).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will disappear after 8 turns, including this one, so it has 8 turns left starting from turn 2.\n\n- (5,3) with value 1 and life span 8.\n\n- (4,1) with value 1 and life span 9.\n\nAll food has positive value +1, so no negative food here. That's good.\n\nInternal obstacles: There are walls at [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. I need to avoid these as well as the borders.\n\nSince the snake is short (length 2), I need to be careful about growing because if I eat food, I'll grow, and that might lead to collisions later.\n\nThe head direction is right, so from (4,2), moving right would go to (5,2). But (5,2) is an obstacle! Let me check the obstacles list: (5,2) is there. So I cannot move right to (5,2) because it's a wall.\n\nSimilarly, moving up from (4,2) would be to (4,3), down to (4,1), left to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is where the body is, but since the snake is moving, when I move, the body will also move, so moving to (3,2) might be possible if the tail moves away.\n\nGeneral rule: When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was the tail is vacated, unless the snake eats food, in which case the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is only two segments, if I move to (3,2), which is the current tail position, after moving, the head will be at (3,2), and the tail was at (3,2), but since I didn't eat food, the tail should move to where? Let's think carefully.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,2), (3,2)] head at (4,2), body/tail at (3,2).\n\nIf I move left to (3,2), that is the current tail position. But according to movement, when I move to a new cell, if it's not food, the tail moves forward.\n\nSo if I move left to (3,2), which is the current tail:\n\n- The head moves to (3,2)\n\n- Since (3,2) is not food (is it food? Let's see food positions: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1) — (3,2) is not listed, so not food), so no food eaten.\n\n- Therefore, the tail should move forward. But the tail was at (3,2), and it needs to move to... in a snake game, when the head moves to a new cell, the segment that was the head becomes the new body, and the tail segment is removed if no growth.\n\nSince the snake has only two segments, if head moves to (3,2), which was the tail, then the new head is at (3,2), and since no growth, the tail should be removed, but that would leave only one segment? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a misunderstanding. Let me recall how snake movement works.\n\nTypically in snake, the snake is a sequence of segments. When you move, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So for a snake of length L, after moving without eating, the head is in the new position, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nSpecifically for two segments: positions [head, tail]. If head moves to a new cell, say new_head, then the tail moves to where the head was. So new positions: [new_head, previous_head].\n\nIn this case, current: head at (4,2), tail at (3,2).\n\nIf I move left to (3,2), but (3,2) is where the tail is now. Moving to (3,2) would be moving into the tail cell.\n\nBut according to rules, it might be allowed because when the head moves to the tail cell, the tail will move away, so it doesn't collide.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nYes, from the core rules: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for this move, if I move left to (3,2), which is the current tail, it should be safe because after the move, the head is at (3,2), and the tail moves to (4,2)? No.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nCurrent positions: head: (4,2), tail: (3,2)\n\nI choose to move left to (3,2).\n\n- New head position: (3,2)\n\n- Since (3,2) was the tail, but now the head is moving there, and since it's not food, the tail should move to the position where the head was, which is (4,2).\n\nSo new snake positions: head at (3,2), tail at (4,2). So the snake has effectively turned around, and now it's at [(3,2), (4,2)], with head at (3,2) and tail at (4,2).\n\nAnd no collision because the tail moved away.\n\nIf I had eaten food, the tail wouldn't move, so moving to the tail would cause collision, but here no food.\n\nSo moving to the current tail position is safe when not eating.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut in this case, from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,3)\n\n- Down: to (4,1)\n\n- Left: to (3,2)  // current tail\n\n- Right: to (5,2) but (5,2) is a wall, so invalid.\n\nAlso, need to check if any of these cells are walls or obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo:\n\n- Up: (4,3) — is this a wall? Internal obstacles: (3,5) is at y=5, x=3; (2,4) etc. (4,3) not listed, so safe.\n\n- Down: (4,1) — is this a wall? Internal: (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, not (4,1). (4,1) is food, but for movement, it's not a wall, so I can move there, but if I do, I eat the food.\n\n(4,1) is a food position: (4,1,9,1) so value 1, life span 9.\n\n- Left: (3,2) — not a wall, and it's the current tail.\n\n- Right: (5,2) — (5,2) is in internal obstacles, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (1,1) life 8, so disappears after turn 2+8=10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 2, life span 8 means it has 8 turns left, including turn 2, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\nCore rules: \"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be there until turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, then at turn t, countdown L, after turn t, countdown L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then disappears after that turn? I think it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\nTypically: if life span is N, it appears at some turn, and lasts for N turns, including the turn it appears. So if it has life span L at turn t, it will be present for turns t to t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nIn this case, turn 2, food at (1,1) life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 2+8-1=9? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 2, life span 8, so after turn 2, it decreases to 7, and so on, down to 0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(1,1) life 8 at turn 2, so after turn 2, life 7; turn 3, life 6; ... turn 9, life 1; turn 10, life 0, disappears? But turn 10 is when it should be gone.\n\nLife span N: present for N turns. At turn t, with life span L, it has L turns left including current, so it will be gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, after turn t, L-1 left; after turn t+1, L-2; ... after turn t+L-1, 1 left; at turn t+L, life span 0, disappears.\n\nBut the food can be eaten on the turn when life span is 1, I think.\n\nIn terms of availability, it can be eaten on any turn from t to t+L-1.\n\nAt turn t+L, it's gone.\n\nSo for (1,1): at turn 2, life 8, so can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9 (since turn 2 + 8 - 1 = 9, or turns 2 to 9 inclusive, that's 8 turns).\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) life 8, same.\n\n(4,1) life 9, so from turn 2 to turn 10 inclusive (9 turns).\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nI need to choose an action for turn 2.\n\nOptions: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2)\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), I eat the food there, since (4,1) is food. Value +1, so snake grows to length 3.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head moves to (4,1), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new body segments: the previous head (4,2) becomes body, and tail stays at (3,2)? No.\n\nSnake positions: before move: head (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nMove down to (4,1): new head at (4,1)\n\nSince (4,1) is food, snake grows, so tail does not move. Therefore, new positions: head (4,1), and the previous body segments remain, so now snake is [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)] with head at (4,1), and segments: (4,1) head, (4,2) body, (3,2) tail.\n\nLength 3.\n\nIf I go up to (4,3), no food there, so snake moves: head to (4,3), tail moves to where head was, (4,2), so new positions [(4,3), (4,2)] head at (4,3), tail at (4,2).\n\nIf I go left to (3,2), no food, head to (3,2), tail to (4,2), so [(3,2), (4,2)] head left at (3,2).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 2, the tail is at (3,2), and food is at (4,1), (1,1), (5,3), not on tail, so no issue for now.\n\nAdjacent means neighboring cells.\n\nFor example, if tail has food on it, and head is next to tail, and I move to eat that food, but since eating food means tail doesn't move, and head moves to tail position, but tail position has food, but when head moves there, it eats the food, so tail doesn't move, but now head is where tail was, and the segment that was tail is still there? Confusing.\n\nRule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nExample: suppose tail cell has food, and head is adjacent to tail. If I move head to tail cell to eat the food, then:\n\n- Head moves to tail cell, eats food.\n\n- Because food eaten, tail does not move, so the tail segment remains where it is.\n\n- But now head is on the tail cell, which was the position of the tail, and the tail segment is still there? But positions: before move, head at some cell adjacent to tail cell, tail cell has food.\n\nAfter move: head moves to tail cell, eats food, so the tail cell now has head, and since growth, the tail segment remains, but it was the tail segment, so now there are two segments at the same position? That causes collision.\n\nYes, so it's deadly.\n\nBut in this state, no food on tail, so no issue.\n\nNow, for turn 2 actions, I need to evaluate each option with future moves.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. But (0,0) is corner, but since x=0 and y=0 are walls, it's blocked.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSnake: head (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1)\n\n(4,1) is directly below head.\n\nSince head at (4,2), down is (4,1) with food.\n\nIf I go down, I eat it immediately, grow to length 3, and get +1 score.\n\nBut is that wise? I need to think long-term.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, it has life span 9, so it will be there for a while, but I might eat it later.\n\nBut moving down might be risky because of obstacles or future positions.\n\nLet's list possible moves for turn 2:\n\n- U: to (4,3)\n\n- D: to (4,1) eat food\n\n- L: to (3,2) safe move\n\nR is invalid.\n\nNow, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, suppose I go down to (4,1) and eat food.\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,1), eat food, score +1, snake now: positions [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)] head at (4,1), direction? I moved down, so new head direction is down.\n\nNow, for turn 3, from (4,1), head down.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,1), I can go U, D, L, R but with constraints.\n\nU: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is now a body segment, since snake is at (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), so (4,2) is the second segment, body. Moving there would cause collision, deadly.\n\nD: to (4,0) — but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL: to (3,1) — not wall, not snake? Snake positions: (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), so (3,1) is free? Let's see if wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), etc., (3,1) not listed, so free.\n\nR: to (5,1) — (5,1) is an internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,1) for turn 3: only L to (3,1), since U and R invalid, D invalid.\n\nU to (4,2) is body, collision; D to (4,0) wall; R to (5,1) wall; so only L to (3,1) possible.\n\nTurn 3: move L to (3,1), no food there, so snake moves: head to (3,1), tail moves to (3,2)? Positions before turn 3: head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nMove left to (3,1): new head (3,1)\n\nNot food, so tail moves: the last segment (tail at (3,2)) is removed, and the segment at (4,2) becomes tail? Movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position.\n\nSo from positions: [head (4,1), seg1 (4,2), tail (3,2)]\n\nHead moves to (3,1), not food, so seg1 moves to where head was, (4,1), and tail moves to where seg1 was, (4,2). Since no growth, tail segment is removed, so new positions: head at (3,1), and the body is at (4,1), and tail at (4,2)? No.\n\nThe body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, and the tail moves to the old first body position.\n\nOld: index 0: head (4,1), index 1: body (4,2), index 2: tail (3,2)\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,1), then the segment that was index 1 moves to old head position (4,1), and the segment that was index 2 (tail) moves to old position of index 1, which is (4,2). But since no growth, we remove the tail segment, meaning that (4,2) is now the tail, and (3,2) is vacated.\n\nNew snake: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ] with head at (3,1), tail at (4,2).\n\nLength still 3.\n\nNow, head at (3,1), direction left.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,1), possible moves.\n\nU: to (3,2) — but (3,2) is not occupied now? Positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2). (3,2) is free? Not snake, not wall? Walls: (1,2) is wall, but (3,2) not listed, so free.\n\nD: to (3,0) — y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL: to (2,1) — not wall, free.\n\nR: to (4,1) — but (4,1) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,2), L to (2,1)\n\nNow, need to see food: (1,1) is food, at (1,1), which is down-left from here.\n\nIf I go U to (3,2), or L to (2,1).\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nThis is one path: if I eat at (4,1) on turn 2, then I'm forced to go left to (3,1) on turn 3, then I have choices on turn 4.\n\nBut I might be cornering myself.\n\nNow, alternative: on turn 2, I go up to (4,3).\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3), no food, so snake moves: head to (4,3), tail to (4,2), so new positions: [(4,3), (4,2)] head at (4,3), tail at (4,2), direction up.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3), head up.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: to (4,4) — not wall, free.\n\nD: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is tail, so can move there? Since tail will move.\n\nBut (4,2) is current tail, moving to it should be safe if no food.\n\nR: to (5,3) — (5,3) is food? Food at (5,3), value 1, life 8. But (5,3) is not wall? Walls: (5,2) is wall, (5,1), but (5,3) not listed, so free, but it has food.\n\nL: to (3,3) — not wall, free.\n\nAlso, D to (4,2) is possible since tail.\n\nNow, if I go R to (5,3), I eat the food there.\n\nBut let's see obstacles: (5,2) is wall, but (5,3) is different.\n\n(5,3) is clear.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nThird option: turn 2 go left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 2: move L to (3,2), no food, so snake moves: head to (3,2), tail to (4,2), new positions [(3,2), (4,2)] head at (3,2), tail at (4,2), direction left.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,2), head left.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: to (3,3) — free\n\nD: to (3,1) — free, as before\n\nL: to (2,2) — but (2,2) not wall? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, (2,2) not listed, so free? (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) is different cell.\n\n(2,2) should be free.\n\nR: to (4,2) — (4,2) is tail, so can move there.\n\nNow, to think long-term, I should consider the available food and paths.\n\nFood at (4,1) is close, but if I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, or it might be risky.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is nearby.\n\n(1,1) is farther.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles might block paths.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I go up to (4,3), then I can go to (5,3) to eat that food.\n\nIf I go down, I eat (4,1) but then I'm at (4,1) with limited moves, only left to (3,1), then from there I can go to (3,2) or (2,1), and (1,1) is food down-left.\n\nBut from (3,1), going to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is above, (2,1) is left-down.\n\nIf I go to (2,1), then (1,1) is adjacent, I can eat it next.\n\nBut let's see if there's danger.\n\nAnother thing: the \"Tail Reward Danger\" might apply later.\n\nBut for now, let's evaluate the options.\n\nFirst, if I eat at (4,1) on turn 2:\n\n- Turn 2: D to (4,1), eat, score+1, snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\n- Turn 3: only possible move L to (3,1), no food, snake: head (3,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\n- Turn 4: from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2) or L to (2,1)\n\nIf I go L to (2,1), then (2,1) is not food, so move, new head (2,1), not food, tail moves, snake: from [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ] head to (2,1), so body segments shift: seg1 to (3,1), tail to (4,1), and tail (4,2) removed? Positions: old head (3,1), seg1 (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nHead moves to (2,1), not food, so seg1 moves to old head (3,1), tail moves to old seg1 position (4,1), and since no growth, the old tail (4,2) is vacated. New snake: [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ] head (2,1), tail (4,1)\n\nNow, (1,1) is adjacent left, and it has food.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1) to eat, or U to (2,2), or D to (2,0) invalid, R to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, collision.\n\nR to (3,1) is body, invalid; D to (2,0) wall; so only L to (1,1) or U to (2,2)\n\nIf I go L to (1,1), eat food, score+1, snake grows: head to (1,1), tail doesn't move, so new snake: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ] head (1,1), tail (4,1)\n\nLength 4.\n\nNow, from (1,1), head at (1,1), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but with constraints.\n\nL: to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nD: to (1,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR: to (2,1) but (2,1) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nU: to (1,2) but (1,2) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (1,2), so invalid.\n\nSo from (1,1), after eating, no possible moves! All directions invalid: left wall, down wall, right body, up wall (1,2) obstacle.\n\nSo the snake is trapped and dies on the next turn.\n\nThat's bad. So if I eat (1,1) at (1,1), I die immediately after because no escape.\n\nTherefore, in this path, if I go to (2,1) and then to (1,1), I die.\n\nBut on turn 4 from (3,1), I had choice to go U to (3,2) instead of L to (2,1).\n\nLet's see that.\n\nFrom turn 3: after moving to (3,1), positions [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 4: go U to (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is not food, so move: head to (3,2), not food, so tail moves: seg1 to (3,1), tail to (4,1), old tail (4,2) vacated.\n\nNew snake: [ (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ] head (3,2), tail (4,1)\n\nNow, from (3,2), possible moves:\n\nU: to (3,3)\n\nD: to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, collision, invalid\n\nL: to (2,2)\n\nR: to (4,2) — (4,2) is not occupied now? Positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), tail (4,1), so (4,2) free.\n\n(4,2) is free, but is it food? No, food at (1,1),(5,3),(4,1) but (4,1) is now tail? (4,1) is tail position, but food was at (4,1), which was eaten? No, (4,1) food was eaten on turn 2, so it's gone, not there anymore.\n\nFood positions: (4,1) was eaten, so no longer present. Only (1,1) and (5,3) left.\n\nSo (4,2) is free.\n\nR to (4,2) possible.\n\nAlso, U to (3,3), L to (2,2)\n\nD to (3,1) invalid.\n\nSo from (3,2), I can go U, L, or R.\n\nBut this is getting messy, and I might not have good access to other food.\n\nMoreover, (1,1) is still there, but if I go towards it, I might get trapped.\n\nBack to turn 2 choice.\n\nIf I eat (4,1) on turn 2, I end up in a position where I might be forced towards (1,1) and get trapped, or go other ways but with obstacles.\n\nPerhaps better not to eat (4,1) now.\n\nNow, option 2: turn 2 go up to (4,3)\n\nTurn 2: U to (4,3), no food, snake: [(4,3), (4,2)] head (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nDirection up.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3), moves:\n\nU: (4,4)\n\nD: (4,2) - tail, safe\n\nL: (3,3)\n\nR: (5,3) - food\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), eat food, score+1, snake grows: head to (5,3), tail doesn't move, so new snake: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ] head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, head at (5,3), direction right.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), moves:\n\nU: to (5,4) - not wall\n\nD: to (5,2) - but (5,2) is wall, invalid\n\nL: to (4,3) - but (4,3) is body, collision, invalid\n\nR: to (6,3) - not wall? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (6,3) is within bounds.\n\nSo possible U or R.\n\nD invalid, L invalid.\n\nU to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nNow, if I go U to (5,4), no food, move: head to (5,4), not food, tail moves: seg1 to (5,3), tail to (4,3)? Positions: old head (5,3), seg1 (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nHead to (5,4), not food, so seg1 moves to old head (5,3), tail moves to old seg1 (4,3), old tail (4,2) vacated. New snake: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] head (5,4), tail (4,3)\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nIf on turn 4 I go R to (6,3), no food, move: head to (6,3), seg1 to (5,3), tail to (4,3), new snake [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nBut (6,3) is close to wall, and obstacles at (6,4), (6,1), so might be limited.\n\nBut I need to consider the other food.\n\n(1,1) is still there, but far.\n\nPerhaps from (5,3), after eating, I can go down, but D to (5,2) is wall, so I can't.\n\nOnly U or R.\n\nNow, back to turn 3, if from (4,3) I don't go R to eat, but go U to (4,4) or L to (3,3) or D to (4,2).\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), no food, snake moves to [(4,4), (4,3)] tail at (4,3)\n\nThen turn 4 from (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I can eat the food later.\n\nSimilarly, for the left move option.\n\nThird option: turn 2 go left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 2: L to (3,2), no food, snake: [(3,2), (4,2)] head (3,2), tail (4,2), direction left.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,2), moves:\n\nU: (3,3)\n\nD: (3,1)\n\nL: (2,2)\n\nR: (4,2) - tail, safe\n\nNow, (3,1) is below, and (4,1) food is there, but (4,1) is at (4,1), which is right-down from (3,2).\n\nIf I go D to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can go to (4,1) to eat, or other.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 3: go D to (3,1), no food, snake moves: head to (3,1), tail to (4,2)? Old positions: head (3,2), tail (4,2)\n\nHead to (3,1), not food, so tail moves to old head (3,2), new snake: [(3,1), (3,2)] head (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1), moves:\n\nU: (3,2) - tail, safe\n\nD: (3,0) wall invalid\n\nL: (2,1)\n\nR: (4,1) - food at (4,1)\n\nIf I go R to (4,1), eat food, score+1, snake grows: head to (4,1), tail doesn't move, so new snake: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, this is similar to when I ate at turn 2, but now at turn 4, and I'm at (4,1) with body at (3,1) and tail at (3,2).\n\nTurn 5: from (4,1), moves: as before, only L to (3,1) possible? U to (4,2) is free? Positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nU to (4,2) - not occupied, not wall? (4,2) is free, and not food.\n\nD to (4,0) wall invalid\n\nL to (3,1) body, collision invalid\n\nR to (5,1) wall invalid\n\nSo only U to (4,2) possible.\n\nTurn 5: U to (4,2), no food, move: head to (4,2), not food, so tail moves: seg1 to (4,1), tail to (3,1), old tail (3,2) vacated. New snake: [ (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) ] head (4,2), tail (3,1)\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move, but (4,2) has obstacles nearby.\n\nU to (4,3), D to (4,1) body, L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) wall.\n\nR to (5,2) wall invalid, D to (4,1) body invalid, so U or L.\n\nSimilar to earlier.\n\nBut I have more space.\n\nBut (1,1) food is still there, and I might go for it, but risk of trap.\n\nTo maximize survival and score, I should avoid the (1,1) area because it's a corner with walls and obstacles.\n\n(1,1) is surrounded: left wall, down wall, up (1,2) wall, right is only way, but if I go there, I might not escape.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is more central.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (5,3) first.\n\nOn turn 2, if I go up to (4,3), then on turn 3 I can go right to (5,3) to eat it.\n\nThen from there, as before, I can go up or right.\n\nFrom (5,3), after eating, on turn 4, I can go U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf I go U to (5,4), then I can continue up or left, etc.\n\nFor example, turn 4: from (5,3) go U to (5,4), no food, snake: head to (5,4), seg1 to (5,3), tail to (4,3), new positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 5: from (5,4), moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body invalid, L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, invalid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, so R invalid.\n\nD invalid, so U to (5,5) or L to (4,4)\n\n(5,5) free, (4,4) free.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI have access to the upper area.\n\nThe food at (1,1) has life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 10, but it's risky to go there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) has life span 9, but if I don't eat it now, I can eat it later from a safer position.\n\nFor example, from the current position, if I go left to (3,2) on turn 2, then on turn 3 I can go down to (3,1), then on turn 4 I can go to (4,1) if I want, but as above, it might lead to issues.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat any food immediately and manuever to a better position.\n\nBut I need to eat to score.\n\nSince all food is positive, I should eat when safe.\n\nBut eating increases length, which might make it harder to manuever.\n\nCurrently length 2, eating makes it 3, which is still small.\n\nBut in the trap scenario, length 4 was trapped.\n\nFor long-term, I should avoid the bottom-left corner.\n\nPerhaps go for (5,3) which is safer.\n\nOn turn 2, go up to (4,3), then turn 3 go right to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (5,4), etc.\n\nWhat about the food at (4,1)? It has life span 9, so I can eat it later if I come back.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be hard.\n\nFrom (4,3), I could go down to (4,2) on turn 3, but (4,2) is tail, moving there is safe.\n\nTurn 3 from (4,3): if I go D to (4,2), which is tail, no food (since (4,2) not food), so move: head to (4,2), tail moves to (4,3)? Old positions: head (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nHead to (4,2), not food, so tail moves to old head (4,3), new snake: [(4,2), (4,3)] head at (4,2), tail at (4,3)\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go down to (4,1) to eat, or other.\n\nBut (4,1) is food, so if I go D to (4,1), eat, then snake grows: head to (4,1), body at (4,2), tail at (4,3), so [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] vertical snake.\n\nThen from (4,1), as before, only left to (3,1) possible, then same as first path.\n\nBut I can avoid going down immediately.\n\nTo maximize turns, I should eat when it doesn't corner me.\n\n(5,3) seems better.\n\nAlso, head direction: after turn 2, if I go up, direction up, then turn 3 I can go right to eat (5,3).\n\nNo instant reverse, but from up, I can go right, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left on turn 2, direction left, then I can go down or up.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nI think going for (5,3) is better.\n\nTurn 2: go U to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 3: go R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen for future turns, I can go up or right from (5,3).\n\nFor example, turn 4: go U to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4), etc.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, but I have space.\n\n(1,1) food might expire, but it's dangerous, so better to leave it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) I can try to eat later if possible.\n\nBut for now, let's plan 5 turns.\n\nAlso, in the answer, I need to output actions for turn 2,3,4,5,6 since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and answer format shows actions for multiple turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2, so output for turn 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut I need to specify actions for each.\n\nBased on above, I think:\n\nTurn 2: U (up)\n\nThen turn 3: R (right) to eat (5,3)\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,3), as before, D and L invalid, so U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4) or R to (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so not R.\n\nD to (5,3) body, invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R on turn 4 to (6,3), then from (6,3), I can go U to (6,4) wall invalid, D to (6,2) not wall? (6,2) free? Walls: (6,1) and (6,4), but (6,2) and (6,3) should be free, but (6,3) is where I am if I go.\n\nAfter turn 4 if at (6,3), then U to (6,4) wall, D to (6,2), L to (5,3) body, R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,3), only D to (6,2) possible.\n\nThen (6,2) might be ok, but limited.\n\nBetter to go up.\n\nSo on turn 4, go U to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4)\n\n(5,5) is free, (4,4) free.\n\nSay go U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 6: from (5,5), can go U to (5,6) but (5,6) is wall? Internal obstacles: (5,6) is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (5,4) body, invalid if snake there.\n\nPositions: let's track.\n\nAfter turn 4: at (5,4), snake: assume after turn 4 move U to (5,4), not food, so from previous: after turn 3, snake ate at (5,3), positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ]? Earlier: after turn 3 eat, snake [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,4), not food, so head to (5,4), not food, so tail moves: seg1 to (5,3), tail to (4,3), old tail (4,2) vacated. New snake: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,5), not food, head to (5,5), not food, tail moves: seg1 to (5,4), tail to (5,3), new snake: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5), moves:\n\nU to (5,6) - (5,6) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n\nD to (5,4) - body, collision invalid\n\nL to (4,5) - not wall? Free\n\nR to (6,5) - not wall? (6,4) wall, but (6,5) not listed, so free? Internal obstacles: (6,4) wall, (5,6) wall, etc., (6,5) not mentioned, so should be free.\n\nBut x=6,y=5, walls are borders and specific internals, so (6,5) is not border since x=7 is border, x=6 is inside, and not in internal list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) free.\n\nSo possible L to (4,5) or R to (6,5)\n\nOr D invalid, U invalid.\n\nSo I can continue.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turn 2 to 6.\n\nIn this plan, I have:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R (eat food)\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: say L to (4,5) or R, but I need to specify.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but for now, this seems feasible.\n\nIf on turn 2 I go left, I might get stuck with (4,1) and (1,1).\n\nFor example, turn 2: L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 3: D to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 4: R to (4,1) eat\n\nThen turn 5: U to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,2), U to (4,3) or L to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut I have the food at (5,3) which I can go for, but with obstacles.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so from (4,2), I can't go right to (5,2), only up or left.\n\nBut (3,2) might be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 5: at (4,2), snake: let's not trace.\n\nBut I think the up path is better for exploration.\n\nMoreover, in the up path, I ate one food, and can eat more later.\n\n(4,1) food might be eaten by going down later, but with life span 9, it has time.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll go with the up and right plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: U (up)\n\nTurn 3: R (right) to eat (5,3)\n\nThen for turn 4, from (5,3), I have to go U or R, R to (6,3) might lead to corner, so better U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 4: U (up)\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), U to (5,5) or L to (4,4), say U to continue.\n\nTurn 5: U (up)\n\nThen turn 6: from (5,5), I can go L to (4,5) or R to (6,5), say L to (4,5) to move towards center or something.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the answer requires actions for multiple turns, I'll define.\n\nAlso, for the left option on turn 2, it might be ok, but I think up is better.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) is directly below, if I don't eat it, and I go up, it might be wasted, but with life span 9, it has many turns, so I can come back.\n\nFor example, from above, I can go down later.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be blocked.\n\nFor instance, (5,2) and (5,1) walls, so the column x=5 is blocked at y=1 and y=2, but I can go around.\n\nI think it's possible.\n\nBut to start, I'll go up.\n\nSo for the answer:\n</think>\nTo maximize long-term survival and score, I must think 5+ turns ahead, prioritizing paths that avoid dead ends, leverage available food safely, and steer clear of the dangerous bottom-left corner near (1,1). The snake is currently short (length 2), so eating food grows it to length 3, increasing collision risks. All food is positive (+1), but (1,1) is high-risk due to surrounding walls and obstacles. The food at (4,1) has a long life span (9 turns), so it can be eaten later. (5,3) is safer and central. Moving up on turn 2 avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to eat (5,3) on turn 3. After eating, moving up opens the board for exploration. I avoid (4,1) for now to prevent trapping the snake in the bottom row.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan:\n- **Turn 2 (current turn)**: Move **U (up)** to (4,3). This avoids the wall at (5,2) and the risky down move to (4,1). No food eaten, snake moves to [(4,3), (4,2)].\n- **Turn 3**: Move **R (right)** to (5,3) to eat the food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 3: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)].\n- **Turn 4**: Move **U (up)** to (5,4). This avoids moving right toward the wall at (6,4) or down into the body. No food, snake moves to [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)].\n- **Turn 5**: Move **U (up)** to (5,5). Continues upward exploration away from obstacles. No food, snake moves to [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)].\n- **Turn 6**: Move **L (left)** to (4,5). Avoids the wall at (5,6) and moves toward open space. No food, snake moves to [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)].\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Survival focus**: Eating (5,3) on turn 3 is safe and scores immediately. The path avoids (1,1) entirely (high-risk trap) and delays eating (4,1) for later when the snake can approach from a safer angle.\n- **Food life spans**: (1,1) expires after turn 10 (life span 8 from turn 2), but it's too dangerous. (4,1) expires after turn 11 (life span 9), so it can be eaten on a future turn (e.g., after turn 6). (5,3) is eaten before it expires (life span 8, eaten on turn 3).\n- **Obstacle avoidance**: The plan steers clear of internal walls (e.g., (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,4)) and borders.\n- **Future flexibility**: After turn 6, the snake can head toward (4,1) or other areas, with options to eat remaining food or avoid starvation.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are described as \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. So these are also walls.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,2). Since it's a list with two positions, it's a snake of length 2. Head direction is Up, which means it's moving upwards.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 7. Since it's turn 3, this food will disappear after turn 3 + 7 = turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 3, life span is 7, meaning it has 7 turns left including this one. After 7 turns, it disappears. So it will be gone after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1 turns? For example, at turn T, countdown is L, then at turn T+1, countdown is L-1, ..., at turn T+L-1, countdown is 1, and then after that turn, it disappears, so it's not present at turn T+L.\n\nStandard way: if life span is L at turn T, it will last for L turns, from turn T to turn T+L-1. So at turn T+L, it's gone.\n\nIn this case, for food at (1,1): at turn 3, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 3+7-1 = turn 9? Let's see: from turn 3 to turn 9, that's 7 turns: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. At turn 10, it's gone. Since it disappears after N turns, and N=7, so after 7 turns from now, meaning turn 3+7=10, it disappears. But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 3, countdown=7; turn 4, countdown=6; ... turn 9, countdown=1; turn 10, countdown=0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten up to and including turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFoods:\n\n- (1,1): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 10)\n\n- (5,3): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 10)\n\n- (4,1): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 11? At turn 3, life span 8, so disappear after turn 3+8=11? Countdown: turn 3:8, turn4:7, ..., turn10:1, turn11:0 gone. So can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nLife span N at turn T means it has N turns left, including current, so last chance to eat is turn T + N - 1.\n\nSo for (1,1): life span 7 at turn 3, last chance turn 3+6=9? Turn T to T+N-1 inclusive.\n\nTurn 3: countdown 7\n\nTurn 4: countdown 6\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: countdown 1\n\nTurn 10: countdown 0, gone. So it exists from turn 3 to turn 9 inclusive. 7 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3): same, turn 3 to 9.\n\n(4,1): life span 8 at turn 3, so turn 3 to 10 inclusive, last chance turn 10.\n\nNow, snake is at [(4,3), (4,2)], head at (4,3), direction Up. So current position: head (4,3), tail (4,2). Since it's moving Up, from (4,2) to (4,3) was the last move? Positions: head first, so [(4,3), (4,2)] means head at (4,3), body at (4,2). Since direction is Up, it was moving up to (4,3) from (4,2)? If head is at (4,3) and direction is U, that means it just moved to (4,3) by going Up from (4,2). Yes.\n\nNow, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints. No instant reverse: since current direction is U, I cannot move D (down) on the next turn, because that would be opposite.\n\nSo forbidden move: Down, since opposite to Up.\n\nAllowed moves: Up, Left, Right. But Down is reverse, not allowed.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but since snake is short, body collision only with itself except tail.\n\nFirst, let's list the walls and obstacles.\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo let's list all wall cells:\n\n- All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n\n- All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n\n- All (x,0) for x=0 to 7? No, border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so for example (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), but corners are included in both.\n\nSpecifically, cells: for x=0, all y; x=7, all y; y=0, all x; y=7, all x. But when x=0 and y=0, it's counted once, etc.\n\nPlus internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nNow, playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with internal obstacles, so not all are free.\n\nFor example, (5,1) is an obstacle, (1,2) is obstacle, etc.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,3), tail at (4,2).\n\nFood at (1,1), (5,3), (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is food, but let's see if it's under snake or not.\n\nSnake positions: (4,3) and (4,2), so (4,1) is not occupied by snake, it's free.\n\n(4,1) is a separate cell.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, from (4,3), possible actions:\n\n- Up (U): to (4,4)\n\n- Down (D): but reverse, not allowed, since current direction is U.\n\n- Left (L): to (3,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,3)\n\nBut (5,3) has food! Positive food.\n\nNow, check if moving to (5,3) is safe.\n\n(5,3): is it a wall? Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (5,3) is x=5,y=3, both between 1 and 6, not border. Internal obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles given: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). So (5,3) is not there, so free.\n\nAlso, no body there; snake is at (4,3) and (4,2), so (5,3) is empty.\n\nMoreover, it has food with value +1.\n\nIf I move right to (5,3), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (5,3), and body: previous head (4,3) becomes body, so positions: [(5,3), (4,3)], and since I ate, length increases to 3, so tail is still (4,2)? When I eat, the tail doesn't move immediately? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning that after moving, the new segment is added, so length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, snake is at S = [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nMove to (5,3): head moves to (5,3), and since it eats food, the tail does not move, so new positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]? Let's see.\n\nTypically, in snake, each turn: head moves to new cell, if food, tail stays, else tail moves forward (removed).\n\nSo here, moving to (5,3), which has food, so after move: head is at (5,3), body segments: previous head (4,3) is now body, and tail (4,2) remains, so positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] with length 3.\n\nAnd direction becomes R (right), since I moved right.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Tail at (4,2), head at (5,3), not adjacent, so no immediate collision.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nSimilarly, other moves:\n\nIf I move Up to (4,4): (4,4) is not wall? x=4,y=4, between 1-6, not in obstacles: obstacles include (2,4), (3,5), etc., not (4,4), so free. No food there, so move to (4,4), no eat, so tail moves: head to (4,4), body: (4,3) now, tail (4,2) removed? Positions: after move, head to new cell, if no eat, tail is removed.\n\nBefore: [(4,3), (4,2)] head at (4,3)\n\nMove U to (4,4): new head at (4,4), since no food, tail (4,2) is removed, so new positions: [(4,4), (4,3)] with direction U.\n\nSimilarly, move Left to (3,3): (3,3) is free? Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (3,5) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed, so free. No food, so move to (3,3), no eat, tail removed: positions [(3,3), (4,3)]? Head to (3,3), body: previous head (4,3) becomes body, tail (4,2) removed, so [(3,3), (4,3)] direction L.\n\nBut now, tail was (4,2), removed, so only two segments.\n\nIn all cases, if no eat, snake remains length 2.\n\nNow, back to moving Right to (5,3) with food.\n\nBut there's also food at (4,1) and (1,1).\n\n(4,1) is below, but I cannot move down directly because reverse is not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can only go U, L, or R.\n\nR to (5,3) has food.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nFirst, if I go to (5,3), I eat food, grow to length 3.\n\nThen, from there, I need to move next.\n\nBut also, there's a danger about tail reward: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, when I move to (5,3), the tail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to head (5,3). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,2) and (5,3) are diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent would be same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n\n(4,2) and (5,3): dx=1, dy=1, so not adjacent; adjacent is |dx|=1 and dy=0 or |dy|=1 and dx=0.\n\nSo not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nNow, after moving to (5,3), positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves from there: cannot move left, because that would be opposite to current direction R? Current direction is now R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nAllowed: R, U, D.\n\nNow, cells around (5,3):\n\n- Right: (6,3)\n\n- Up: (5,4)\n\n- Down: (5,2)\n\nBut (5,2) is an internal obstacle! (5,2) is in the list: internal obstacles include (5,2), so wall, cannot move there.\n\n(5,2) is wall.\n\nAlso, (6,3): is it wall? x=6,y=3. Border: x=6 is not 0 or 7? x=7 is border, x=6 is not border. y=3 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): x=5,y=4, not border, obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), not (5,4), so free.\n\nDown to (5,2) is wall, so impossible.\n\nSo from (5,3), possible moves: Right to (6,3), Up to (5,4), or Down but down to (5,2) is wall, so only Right or Up.\n\nCannot move Down because it's wall, and cannot move Left because reverse.\n\nSo only R or U.\n\nIf I go Right to (6,3): (6,3) no food, I assume? Food positions: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1); (5,3) will be eaten if I move there, so after I eat it, it's gone? Food is only at those positions, so (6,3) no food.\n\nMove to (6,3), no eat, so snake: head to (6,3), body: (5,3) becomes body, tail (4,2) removed, but since I grew to length 3, after no eat, tail moves.\n\nAfter eating at turn 3: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] at turn 4? Let's clarify turns.\n\nAt turn 3, I decide move to (5,3).\n\nAfter move, at the end of turn 3, snake is at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] with length 3.\n\nNow, for turn 4, I need to move from there.\n\nHead at (5,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, and also reverse direction? L is opposite to R, so cannot move L.\n\nAlso, (4,3) is occupied by body, so collision if I move there.\n\nBut since I cannot move L because reverse, it's forbidden anyway.\n\nSo only R or U.\n\nMove R to (6,3): (6,3) is free? As above, not wall, no body (body at (5,3) and (4,3), (4,2)), so ok. No food, so after move, head to (6,3), body: (5,3) becomes body, tail (4,2) removed, so new positions: [(6,3), (5,3)] and (4,3) is now the body, but tail was (4,2), removed, so positions: [(6,3), (5,3)] with direction R. Length 2 again? No.\n\nBefore move at turn 4 start: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,2).\n\nMove head to (6,3): new head (6,3), and since no food, tail is removed, so the tail (4,2) is removed, and body (4,3) becomes the new tail. So positions: [(6,3), (5,3)] with head (6,3) and tail (5,3). Length 2.\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (5,4): new head (5,4), no food, tail removed, positions [(5,4), (5,3)] direction U.\n\nBut now, in both cases, I have only length 2 again, since I didn't eat again.\n\nBut I ate at turn 3, so for one turn I had length 3, but after moving without eating, it shrinks back? No, in snake, when you eat, the length increases permanently, but when you move without eating, the tail moves, so length stays the same only if you don't eat; when you eat, length increases by 1.\n\nLet's clarify the growth.\n\nWhen you move to a cell with food, you eat it, so the snake grows: the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so tail does not move. Length increases by 1.\n\nWhen you move to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, and tail moves forward (the last segment is removed), so length remains the same.\n\nIn this case, at turn 3, I move to (5,3) with food, so after turn 3, snake is length 3: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nThen at turn 4, I move to say (6,3) no food, so head moves to (6,3), tail moves, so the tail (4,2) is removed, and the new positions are [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]? No.\n\nPositions before move: segments: index 0: head (5,3), index 1: body (4,3), index 2: tail (4,2)\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so new head at (6,3), and the body segments shift: the old head becomes new body part 1, old body part 1 becomes new body part 2, but since no growth, the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (6,3), body: old head (5,3) is now body segment, and old body (4,3) is now tail. The old tail (4,2) is removed because no growth.\n\nSo positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]? Head (6,3), then body (5,3), then tail (4,3). But (4,3) was body, now tail, and (4,2) is gone.\n\nLength is still 3, because I didn't eat, so length doesn't increase, but since I ate before, length is 3, and after moving without eating, length remains 3, but the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, from [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] move to (6,3) no food: new head (6,3), body: (5,3), and tail: since tail was (4,2), but it is removed, and the segment before it, (4,3), becomes the new tail? Let's think of the list.\n\nThe snake is a list of cells: [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail]\n\nWhen moving to new cell new_head:\n\n- If no food, new snake is [new_head, head, segment1, ..., segment_{n-2}] , so the tail (last element) is removed.\n\n- If food, new snake is [new_head, head, segment1, ..., tail] , so tail is kept, length increases.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions [head=(5,3), seg1=(4,3), tail=(4,2)]\n\nMove to (6,3) no food: new snake [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] and tail (4,2) is removed, so positions [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] with head (6,3), tail (4,3).\n\nLength still 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to a food, it would be [new_head, (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] with new food.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 4, from (5,3), moving to (6,3) no food, so snake at [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nOr move U to (5,4) no food, snake [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] etc.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nAt turn 3, from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) to eat food immediately.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nMove U to (4,4): no food, so after move, positions [(4,4), (4,3)] with direction U, length 2.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nMove L to (3,3): no food, positions [(3,3), (4,3)] direction L.\n\nNow, food at (4,1) is below, but I can't go down directly.\n\nAlso, (4,1) has food with life span 8, so it will last until turn 10.\n\n(1,1) and (5,3) last until turn 9.\n\n(5,3) is close, but if I eat it, I grow, but then from (5,3), I can only go R or U, as we saw.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3), then to (6,3), which is near border.\n\n(6,3): from there, possible moves.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction R.\n\nCannot move L (reverse).\n\nCan move R to (7,3), but x=7 is wall, so cannot.\n\nMove U to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle! In the list, (6,4) is wall.\n\nMove D to (6,2), is it free? x=6,y=2, not border, internal obstacles: (6,1), (6,4), not (6,2), so should be free.\n\nBut from (6,3), move D to (6,2): (6,2) free? No obstacles listed, so yes.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nSo from (6,3), I can only go U or D, but U to (6,4) is wall, so only D to (6,2).\n\nThen to (6,2), and so on.\n\nBut this seems risky, near walls.\n\nSimilarly, if from (5,3) I go U to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) free, no food, then positions [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] if I had eaten.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nPerhaps eating (5,3) is good, but I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is food at (4,1), which is directly below the head, but I can't go down because reverse.\n\nSo I need to manuever to get there.\n\nFor example, I could move left or up first, then come back down.\n\nBut (4,1) has longer life span, turn 10, while others turn 9.\n\nAlso, (1,1) is far.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to eat multiple foods.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. But since playable area is inside, we care about cells (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo free cells are all except these.\n\nFor example, row y=1: x=1 to 6, but obstacles (5,1), (6,1), so free: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — (4,1) is food, not obstacle. (5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: x=1 to 6, obstacles (1,2), (5,2), so free: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2) — but (4,2) is current tail, but it may move.\n\ny=3: x=1 to 6, obstacles: (5,2) is y=2, (3,5) is y=5, so no obstacles at y=3 except borders. Free: (1,3) to (6,3) all, but (4,3) head, (5,3) food.\n\n(5,3) has food, so not obstacle.\n\ny=4: x=1 to 6, obstacles (2,4), (6,4), so free: (1,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)\n\ny=5: x=1 to 6, obstacles (3,5), so free: (1,5), (2,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\ny=6: x=1 to 6, obstacles (5,6), so free: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (6,6)\n\nAnd x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 as above.\n\nNow, foods: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1)\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is free, food.\n\nAt turn 3, head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nI want to eat (4,1), but I cannot move down directly.\n\nSo I need to go left, right, or up, then come down.\n\nBut (4,1) has life until turn 10, so I have time.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which I can eat now by moving right.\n\nBut if I eat it, I grow to length 3, and from (5,3), I can only go to (6,3) or (5,4), both of which may lead to dead ends.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) to (6,3): then from (6,3), I can only go down to (6,2), since (6,4) is wall, (7,3) wall, (6,3) to (5,3) reverse not allowed.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (6,2): (6,2) free, no food, then from (6,2), direction D.\n\nCan move L to (5,2), but (5,2) wall.\n\nR to (7,2) wall.\n\nD to (6,1), but (6,1) obstacle.\n\nU to (6,3), but reverse not allowed? Direction is D, so cannot move U.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), direction is D (down).\n\nThen possible moves: L to (5,2) wall, R to (7,2) wall, D to (6,1) wall, U to (6,3) but U is opposite to D, so cannot move U.\n\nAll moves blocked! Dead end.\n\nIf I go from (5,3) to (5,4): (5,4) free, no food.\n\nThen from (5,4), direction U.\n\nCan move U to (5,5), or L to (4,4), or R to (6,4), but (6,4) wall, or D to (5,3) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,5), L to (4,4).\n\nIf U to (5,5): free, then from there, etc.\n\nBut not immediate dead end, but the area might be constrained.\n\nBut let's think about eating (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is below, so I need to get the head down to (4,1).\n\nSince I cannot move down directly, I can move left or right, then down, then back.\n\nFor example, move left to (3,3), then from there, I can move down to (3,2), then left or right, but (3,2) is free, then to (3,1) or (3,3) etc, but I need to go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), move L to (3,3).\n\nThen positions after turn 3: [(3,3), (4,3)] direction L.\n\nThen at turn 4, from (3,3), I can move L, U, D, but not R (reverse).\n\nCells: L to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2).\n\nAll possible.\n\n(3,2) is free, (3,4) free, (2,3) free.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), then I am at y=2, closer to y=1.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (4,2) or (2,2), etc.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), so from (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), but (4,2) is current tail, but at turn 4, it may have moved.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 3: start, head (4,3), dir U, positions [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nI move L to (3,3): no food, so after move, positions [(3,3), (4,3)] and tail (4,2) removed, so length 2, positions [(3,3), (4,3)] dir L.\n\nTurn 4: head (3,3), dir L.\n\nI can move D to (3,2): (3,2) free, no food, so move to (3,2), no eat, tail removed: previous tail is (4,3), removed, so new positions [(3,2), (3,3)] dir D.\n\nTurn 5: head (3,2), dir D.\n\nNow, I can move to (3,1), or (2,2), or (4,2).\n\n(3,1) is free? y=1, x=3, not obstacle, so free. No food.\n\n(2,2) free, no food.\n\n(4,2): is it free? At turn 5, but (4,2) may be occupied or not. Currently, no, it's free.\n\n(4,2) is not food, not obstacle.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,2) first or directly.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move R to (4,2): (4,2) free, no food, so move to (4,2), positions [(4,2), (3,2)] dir R.\n\nThen turn 6: head (4,2), dir R.\n\nThen I can move D to (4,1): (4,1) has food! And I can move down, but current direction is R, so moving D is not reverse; reverse would be L, since last move was right.\n\nDirections: from (3,2) to (4,2) by moving R, so direction R.\n\nThen from (4,2), moving D to (4,1) is not opposite; opposite to R is L, so D is allowed.\n\n(4,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nSo at turn 6, I eat (4,1), grow to length 3.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger?\n\nAt turn 6, before move, positions [(4,2), (3,2)] head (4,2), tail (3,2).\n\nI move to (4,1), which is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,2), head moving to (4,1).\n\n(3,2) and (4,1): dx=1, dy=1, not adjacent; adjacent would be (4,2) and (4,1) for example, but tail is at (3,2).\n\nDistance: |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent.\n\nThe tail cell: (3,2) does not have food; the food is at (4,1), which is the cell I'm moving to.\n\nTail reward danger is when the tail cell has food and head is adjacent to tail, then eating that food causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are adjacent, and after growth, they are still adjacent but now body, so collision.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,2), no food there, and I'm moving to (4,1) which has food, but tail is not at (4,1), so no problem.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), eat food, so new positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (3,2), length 3.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo by going left then down then right then down, I can reach (4,1) in a few turns.\n\nTurns: turn 3 move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4 move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5 move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (4,1) eat.\n\nBut at turn 5, from (3,2) I moved R to (4,2), but I could have moved directly to (4,1)? From (3,2), to (4,1) is not adjacent; moves are only U/D/L/R, so I can only go to (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). Not diagonal. So to (4,1) I need to go via (4,2) or (3,1) etc.\n\nSo the path above is fine.\n\nNow, this takes until turn 6 to eat (4,1).\n\nBut at turn 3, I could eat (5,3) immediately.\n\n(5,3) has life until turn 9, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) until turn 10.\n\n(1,1) until turn 9.\n\nBut (1,1) is far, at (1,1), I might not go there soon.\n\nNow, another option: from (4,3), move U to (4,4).\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut let's think about maximizing score.\n\nIf I eat (5,3) now at turn 3, I get +1, grow to length 3.\n\nThen from (5,3), I have to go to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nIf I go to (6,3), then as before, I might get stuck, dead end.\n\nFrom (6,3), only down to (6,2), then from (6,2), only up or down? After moving to (6,2), direction D, then I can only go down to (6,1) but wall, or left/right but (5,2) wall, (7,2) wall, up to (6,3) reverse not allowed, so stuck, dead. Snake dies.\n\nIf from (5,3) I go up to (5,4), then I can move to (5,5) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach other foods.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can go to (4,4) or (5,5).\n\n(4,4) free, (5,5) free.\n\nThen to (4,4), I can go down to (4,3) or left, etc.\n\nBut (4,3) might be occupied later.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid (5,3) for now and go for (4,1) which is safer and has longer life.\n\n(4,1) is closer in a way, but I need to go around.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can be flexible.\n\nAnother idea: I can move right to (5,3) but not eat it? No, if I move to (5,3), I have to eat it since there is food, so I will eat it and grow.\n\nThe rule doesn't say I can choose not to eat; if I move to a cell with food, I eat it.\n\nSo I cannot avoid eating if I move there.\n\nTherefore, moving to (5,3) forces me to eat and grow, which might put me in a tight spot.\n\nWhereas if I go for (4,1), I can eat it later with less risk.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,1), I am at (4,1), and I can go to other places.\n\n(4,1) is at bottom, but I can move left or right.\n\nFor example, to (3,1) or (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, so only left to (3,1) or up to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut let's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to think ahead but output actions starting from current turn.\n\nThe answer format is for turns t_1, t_1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the sequence.\n\nBut I don't have to output 5 moves if not necessary, but since it says \"prioritize long-term survival\", I should plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I can output the next few moves to achieve a goal.\n\nSince (4,1) is available and safe to eat, and (5,3) is risky, I should go for (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is there but far, I might not reach it soon.\n\nLife spans: (1,1) and (5,3) disappear after turn 9, so last chance turn 9.\n\n(4,1) last chance turn 10.\n\nCurrent turn 3, so I have 7 turns for (1,1) and (5,3), 8 for (4,1).\n\nBut to reach (1,1) from (4,3), it might take several turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (1,1): need to go left and down.\n\nBut with obstacles, like (1,2) is wall, so I cannot go directly to (1,1) from (1,2), etc.\n\nPath to (1,1): from (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), then to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (2,1), then to (1,1).\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is possible.\n\nCells: (2,3) free, (2,2) free, (2,1) free, (1,1) food.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so from (2,2) I can go down to (2,1) or right to (3,2), etc., but to (1,1) from (2,1) directly.\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is left, adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) to (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1) to (1,1).\n\nEach move, 4 moves to reach (1,1), but I might not eat immediately if I go through.\n\nBut (1,1) has food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nBut let's count turns.\n\nIf at turn 3 I move to (3,3), not eat.\n\nTurn 4 to (2,3), not eat.\n\nTurn 5 to (2,2), not eat.\n\nTurn 6 to (2,1), not eat? (2,1) no food.\n\nThen turn 7 to (1,1) eat.\n\nBut (1,1) life until turn 9, so turn 7 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,1), as before, turn 6 eat.\n\nBut if I go directly to (4,1), I can eat at turn 6.\n\nIf I go to (1,1), eat at turn 7.\n\nBut (1,1) is farther, and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nSince there is food at (4,1) which is closer, and I can eat it safely.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,1), I can consider (5,3) or (1,1).\n\nBut (5,3) might be eaten by then or not, but since no other snake, it stays.\n\nNow, back to the tail reward danger: for (4,1), when I eat it, as in the path, no danger.\n\nBut another thing: (4,1) is at (4,1), and the snake body might be there, but in this case, when I move to (4,1), the body is not there yet.\n\nIn the path I described, at turn 6, I move to (4,1), and previous positions are (4,2) and (3,2), so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,3) later.\n\nFor example, from current position, I move left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,1) eat at turn 6.\n\nThen after that, I am at (4,1) with length 3, positions say [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)] if I came from left.\n\nThen from there, I can move left to (3,1) or up to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, so cannot, or right, but (5,1) wall, so only left to (3,1) or up to (4,2) but body, collision.\n\nAfter eating at (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (3,2) or whatever.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n\n- D: y=1, down to (4,0) but y=0 wall, cannot.\n\n- L to (3,1)\n\n- R to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, wall.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is free, no food, so move to (3,1), no eat, tail moves.\n\nTail was (3,2) or whatever, but let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 6: after moving to (4,1) and eating, positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (3,2)  // since from (4,2) to (4,1), and body was (3,2) before? In turn 6 move.\n\nAt turn 5 end: positions [(4,2), (3,2)] head (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nMove D to (4,1): food, so new positions [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]  // head, previous head, tail\n\nNow, from (4,1), moves: U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision.\n\nD to (4,0) wall.\n\nL to (3,1)\n\nR to (5,1) wall.\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nMove to (3,1), no food, so new head (3,1), body (4,1), and tail (4,2) removed? Positions: before move, [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2) ]\n\nHead moves to (3,1), no food, so new snake: [ (3,1), (4,1) ] and tail (3,2) removed, so positions [(3,1), (4,1)] with direction L, length 2.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut the point is, after eating (4,1), I am forced to move left to (3,1), and I have to leave the area.\n\nNow, (5,3) is still there, but I am at (3,1), far from it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is at (1,1), which is adjacent to (3,1)? (3,1) to (1,1) not directly, need to go to (2,1) then (1,1).\n\n(2,1) is free.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move to (2,1) or (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) can be eaten.\n\nSince (5,3) is close now, and if I don't eat it, I might eat it later, but from above, if I go to (4,1) first, I may not get back to (5,3) easily.\n\nAt turn 3, if I eat (5,3), I get +1 now, but then I risk getting stuck.\n\nBut from (5,3), instead of going to (6,3), I can go up to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nSay to (4,4): then from (4,4), I can go to (3,4) or (4,5) or (4,3), etc.\n\n(4,3) might be free later.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (4,1) from there.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1), but (4,2) and (4,3) may have body.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,3) at turn 3, positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,4), no food, so head to (5,4), tail moves: new positions [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]  // tail (4,2) removed\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nSay move L to (4,4): no food, so head to (4,4), tail moves: positions [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)] or something.\n\nBefore move: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove to (4,4): new head (4,4), no food, so new snake [ (4,4), (5,4) ] and tail (5,3) removed? Old tail is (4,3), removed.\n\nPositions: [ (4,4), (5,4) ] with direction L, length 2.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), but (4,3) was previous position, may be free.\n\nAt turn 5, (4,3) is free, no body.\n\nMove to (4,3), no food, positions [(4,3), (4,4)] etc.\n\nThen to (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\nBut it takes more turns, and I might not have time for other foods.\n\nBut (4,1) life until turn 10, so ok.\n\nBut I ate (5,3) at turn 3, so I have one point.\n\nThen I can eat (4,1) later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) might be eaten if I go.\n\nBut let's compare the paths.\n\nPath 1: Eat (5,3) at turn 3.\n\nThen go to (5,4) at turn 4, then to (4,4) at turn 5, then to (4,3) at turn 6, then to (4,2) at turn 7, then to (4,1) at turn 8 eat.\n\nAt turn 8, (4,1) still exists, life span 8 from turn 3, last chance turn 10.\n\nEat at turn 8.\n\nScore: +1 from (5,3), +1 from (4,1), total 2.\n\nBut at turn 8, I eat (4,1), then from there, I am at (4,1), and I have to move to (3,1), as before.\n\nThen I can go to (1,1) if possible.\n\nFrom (3,1) at turn 9, move to (2,1) then to (1,1) at turn 10, but (1,1) disappears after turn 10? Last chance turn 10, so at turn 10 I can eat it if I move there.\n\nTurn 10 move to (1,1) eat.\n\nBut need to see if possible.\n\nPath 2: Avoid (5,3), go directly for (4,1).\n\nTurn 3: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1) eat.\n\nScore +1 at turn 6.\n\nThen at turn 6, after eat, positions [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]? In the move, from (4,2) to (4,1), so positions [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)] if the body was there.\n\nThen turn 7: only move L to (3,1), no eat, positions [(3,1), (4,1)] after tail move.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move to (2,1) at turn 8, then to (1,1) at turn 9 eat.\n\n(1,1) last chance turn 9, so eat at turn 9.\n\nScore +1 from (4,1), +1 from (1,1), total 2.\n\nSame as path 1.\n\nIn path 1, I also ate (5,3), so score 2, same.\n\nBut in path 1, when I ate (5,3) at turn 3, I had a risk of dead end if I chose wrong move, but I avoided by going up.\n\nIn path 2, no such risk.\n\nAlso, in path 2, I ate (4,1) at turn 6 and (1,1) at turn 9.\n\nIn path 1, ate (5,3) at turn 3, (4,1) at turn 8, and possibly (1,1) at turn 10.\n\nBut in path 1, at turn 8 after eating (4,1), I am at (4,1), then turn 9 move to (3,1), then turn 10 to (2,1), but to eat (1,1), I need to be at (1,1) at turn 10.\n\nFrom (3,1) at turn 9, I can move to (2,1) at turn 9? Turn 9 start from (3,1), move to (2,1), no eat, then turn 10 from (2,1) move to (1,1) eat.\n\n(1,1) can be eaten at turn 10? Life span: at turn 3, life span 7, so last chance turn 9 (since turn 3 to 9: 7 turns), at turn 10 it is gone.\n\nSo at turn 10, (1,1) is not there, so I cannot eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3), last chance turn 9.\n\nIn path 1, I ate (5,3) at turn 3, good.\n\n(4,1) at turn 8, good.\n\n(1,1) last chance turn 9, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nIn path 1, at turn 8, after eating (4,1), I am at (4,1), turn 9 I move to (3,1), not to (1,1).\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 8, after eating, positions as before, but at turn 8 end: after eating (4,1), say positions [(4,1), (4,2), something]\n\nThen turn 9: only move to (3,1), so at (3,1), not at (1,1).\n\nI can't reach (1,1) by turn 9 from there.\n\nIn path 2, at turn 6 I am at (4,1) after eating, turn 7 move to (3,1), turn 8 move to (2,1), turn 9 move to (1,1) eat.\n\nSo I can eat (1,1) at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, in both paths I can eat two foods: in path 1, (5,3) and (4,1); in path 2, (4,1) and (1,1).\n\n(5,3) and (1,1) both have value 1, same.\n\nBut in path 1, when I ate (5,3), I was at risk, and also, after that, I used turns to go around.\n\nIn path 2, I go directly to (4,1) then to (1,1), no risk.\n\nMoreover, (4,1) has longer life, but I eat it early.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and there might be more food later, but currently only three foods.\n\nPerhaps after eating these, new food spawns, but we don't know, so I should eat available ones.\n\nAnother option: eat (5,3) now, then immediately go down, but I cannot, because from (5,3) I cannot go down, (5,2) wall.\n\nSo I have to go up or right.\n\nI think path 2 is safer and achieves the same score without risk.\n\nI could eat (5,3) and then go to eat (4,1) later, but as above, I can still eat two foods.\n\nBut in path 2, I eat (4,1) and (1,1), both +1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see the grid: (5,3) is at (5,3), which is near obstacles, so better to avoid.\n\nWhereas (4,1) is more accessible.\n\nMoreover, in the tail reward danger, for (4,1), it is under where the tail was, but in my path, when I move to (4,1), the tail is at (3,2), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nIf I had gone directly down, but I can't.\n\nSo I think going for (4,1) first is better.\n\nThen I can plan the moves.\n\nAt turn 3, move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 4, move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5, move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6, move D to (4,1) and eat.\n\nThen turn 7, move L to (3,1)  // only choice\n\nThen turn 8, from (3,1), I can move to (2,1) or (3,2)\n\n(3,2) may be free.\n\nMove to (2,1): (2,1) free, no food.\n\nThen turn 9, from (2,1), move to (1,1) and eat.\n\nBut at turn 9, (1,1) is still there, last chance.\n\nSo I eat it.\n\nThen I have two points.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 3.\n\nBut I don't need to output all, but since I have a plan, I can output the next few turns.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many, but since I think 5+ turns, I can output 5 or 6 moves.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3.\n\nSo for turn 3: move L (left)\n\nThen turn 4: move D (down)\n\nTurn 5: move R (right)\n\nTurn 6: move D (down) to eat (4,1)\n\nThen turn 7: move L (left) to (3,1)\n\nBut turn 7 is after, and I may not need to specify, but for completeness.\n\nSince the food at (5,3) is not eaten, it will stay, but I may not get it.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo maximize, I could include (5,3) but it might be tight.\n\nAnother idea: from turn 3, move R to (5,3) eat, then turn 4 move U to (5,4), turn 5 move L to (4,4), turn 6 move D to (4,3), but (4,3) may have body.\n\nAfter turn 3: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,4), no food, so head to (5,4), tail moves: new positions [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]  // tail (4,2) removed\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,4), no food, so head to (4,4), tail moves: positions [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)]? Before: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ], move to (4,4), new head (4,4), no food, so new snake [ (4,4), (5,4) ] and tail (5,3) removed, so [(4,4), (5,4)] dir L.\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,4), move D to (4,3), no food, positions [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nThen turn 7: move D to (4,2), no food, positions [(4,2), (4,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,1) eat.\n\nEat at turn 8.\n\nThen as before.\n\nBut I missed (1,1), and (5,3) eaten at turn 3.\n\nTo get (1,1), I need to go there, but from (4,1) at turn 8, I move to (3,1) at turn 9, then to (2,1) at turn 10, but (1,1) gone at turn 10.\n\nCannot eat (1,1).\n\nSo only one additional point from (4,1), total two including (5,3).\n\nIn the first path of path 2, I can eat two.\n\nIn the safer path, I eat (4,1) and (1,1).\n\nNow, for (1,1), in the path, I eat at turn 9.\n\nBut in the move sequence, after turn 6, I have turn 7 move L to (3,1), turn 8 move to (2,1), turn 9 move to (1,1) eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, I think the best is to go for (4,1) and then (1,1).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 4: D (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 5: R (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 6: D (to (4,1) eat)\n\nThen turn 7: L (to (3,1))\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can output 5 moves: turns 3 to 7.\n\nBut turn 7 is moving to (3,1), which is part of the plan.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nI could output fewer, but I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the direction: when I move, the direction changes, but as long as I don't reverse, it should be ok.\n\nIn turn 3, from (4,3) dir U, move L to (3,3), not reverse, so allowed.\n\nThen from (3,3), after move, direction is L, so turn 4, from (3,3) dir L, move D to (3,2), not reverse (opposite would be R), so allowed.\n\nThen from (3,2), after move, direction D, so turn 5, move R to (4,2), not reverse (opposite U), allowed.\n\nThen from (4,2), dir R, turn 6 move D to (4,1), not reverse (opposite L), allowed.\n\nThen from (4,1), after eating, direction D, but turn 7, I move L to (3,1), which is not opposite to D, so allowed.\n\nAll good.\n\nIf I output these, it should be fine.\n\nBut for thinking ahead, I have a plan for eating (1,1) later.\n\nSince the question is to maximize score, and I can potentially eat all, but (5,3) might be left, but I can't eat all with the time.\n\nIn this plan, I eat two, same as if I ate (5,3) and (4,1).\n\nBut with less risk.\n\nMoreover, survival: in the dead end scenario, I die, so better avoid.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that avoids immediate risks and prioritizes eating the positive food at (4,1) first, followed by the food at (1,1). This path is safe, avoids dead ends, and leverages the longer life span of the food at (4,1) (life span 8, disappears after turn 10). The food at (5,3) is not targeted due to the risk of entering a dead end after eating it (e.g., moving to (6,3) could lead to a trap with no escape).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 3)**: Snake head at (4,3), direction Up. Positions: [(4,3), (4,2)]. Food available: (1,1) (value +1, life span 7, disappears after turn 9), (5,3) (value +1, life span 7, disappears after turn 9), (4,1) (value +1, life span 8, disappears after turn 10).\n- **Movement Constraints**: Cannot move opposite to current direction. At turn 3, direction is Up, so Down is forbidden. Subsequent directions are updated after each move.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - Eating (5,3) now could force movement to (6,3) or (5,4), leading to potential dead ends (e.g., (6,3) to (6,2) to no escape).\n  - (4,1) is safe to eat; no tail reward danger as the tail is not adjacent when moving to it.\n- **Path to (4,1)**: Requires maneuvering since Down is forbidden initially. Path: Left to (3,3), Down to (3,2), Right to (4,2), Down to (4,1) to eat at turn 6.\n- **Path to (1,1)**: After eating (4,1), move Left to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (1,1) to eat at turn 9 (before it disappears).\n- **Score Maximization**: This sequence eats two positive foods (+2 score) by turn 9. (5,3) is skipped but is not critical for survival or score given the risks.\n- **Survival Focus**: The path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 7, the snake is in a flexible position to continue exploring or eat new food that may spawn.\n\n### Planned Moves (5+ Turns Ahead):\n- **Turn 3 (current)**: Move Left (L) to (3,3). Reason: Avoids (5,3) risk, starts path to (4,1). Direction changes to Left.\n- **Turn 4**: Move Down (D) to (3,2). Reason: Moves closer to (4,1). Direction changes to Down.\n- **Turn 5**: Move Right (R) to (4,2). Reason: Positions head adjacent to (4,1). Direction changes to Right.\n- **Turn 6**: Move Down (D) to (4,1) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 3). Direction changes to Down.\n- **Turn 7**: Move Left (L) to (3,1). Reason: Only safe move from (4,1) (other moves blocked by walls or body). Direction changes to Left.\n\n### Beyond Turn 7:\n- **Turn 8**: Move Left (L) to (2,1). Reason: Continue toward (1,1). Direction: Left.\n- **Turn 9**: Move Down (D) to (1,1) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 4). Direction: Down.\n- **Turn 10+**: After eating (1,1), the snake can explore safely (e.g., move to (1,2) is blocked by obstacle, so move to (2,2) or (1,1) to other cells).\n\nThis sequence ensures survival and maximizes score by eating two foods, with a clear path for future turns. No negative food is present, so all actions focus on positive rewards.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: L (left)  \nTurn 4: D (down)  \nTurn 5: R (right)  \nTurn 6: D (down)  \nTurn 7: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and the snake is on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Internal obstacles are given: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. I should plot this to visualize.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,3), body at (4,3), so it's a short snake, only two segments long. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left to (3,3) from (4,3). Since head is at (3,3) and previous was (4,3), moving left makes sense.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned here.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since the snake is short, growing is important, but I must avoid collisions.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3)\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (3,4)), D (down to (3,2)), L (left to (2,3)), R (right to (4,3)). But (4,3) is occupied by the body, so moving right would cause a collision because the body is there. Let me check the rules.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nThe tail segment is at (4,3). If I move right to (4,3), since the tail is there, but after moving, the tail will move away, so it should be safe, right?\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nYes, so moving to the tail cell is allowed because when the head moves there, the tail moves forward, so it doesn't collide. In this case, the snake has only two segments: head at (3,3) and tail at (4,3). If I move right to (4,3), the new head position would be (4,3), and since we're moving, the tail will move to where the head was, I think. Standard snake movement.\n\nAfter moving, the new positions: if head moves to a new cell, the body follows. Specifically, for a snake of length L, when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nIn this case, no food is eaten yet, so if I move, the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nSo, if I move right to (4,3), which is currently the tail position. After move: head is at (4,3), and the body segment (which was head) is at (3,3). So the new positions are [(4,3), (3,3)]. No collision because the tail moved away.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to other cells.\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied now, but since it's the tail, it's okay to move there.\n\nNow, other moves: left to (2,3), up to (3,4), down to (3,2).\n\nAlso, need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so moving to those coordinates would be wall collision.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is an obstacle? (3,5) is listed, so if I move up to (3,4), that might be okay, but (3,5) is obstacle, so moving to (3,5) would be bad, but (3,4) is not listed as obstacle, so should be free.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\n- Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo cells to avoid: all border cells and these internal points.\n\nNow, for current head (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,4). Is (3,4) valid? (3,4) is not border, not in internal obstacles (internal has (3,5) but not (3,4)), so (3,4) is free.\n\n- D: to (3,2). (3,2) not border, not in obstacles (obstacles: (1,2), (5,2), but not (3,2)), so free.\n\n- L: to (2,3). (2,3) not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- R: to (4,3). (4,3) is current tail, but since it's tail, it should be movable to, as per rule.\n\n(4,3) is not a wall or permanent obstacle; it's the snake's own tail, which will move.\n\nSo all four directions are possible in terms of immediate move? But R to (4,3) should be okay.\n\nNow, head direction is L (left), so if I move right, that would be opposite direction, but the rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving R (right) would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So I cannot move right on this turn.\n\nTherefore, possible moves from (3,3) with current dir L: U, D, L. R is invalid because reverse.\n\nSo options: U, D, or L.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (1,1): value 1, life span 6. Since current turn is 4, it will disappear after 6 turns, so on turn 10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 4, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, including turn 4. So after turn 4, it has 5 more turns? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (1,1): life span 6 at turn 4. After turn 4, life span becomes 5, then 4, etc., until 0, and disappears after N turns, meaning when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that it is present for N turns starting from when it was spawned, but here it's given with current life span.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), and life_span is the remaining life span at current turn.\n\nSo at turn t=4, for (1,1): life_span=6, so it will be there for 6 more turns? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t, with life_span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nLet me read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then after this turn, it decreases, and it disappears when life_span reaches 0.\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" could mean it is removed after N turns have passed.\n\nTo be precise: with countdown including current turn decreasing, so for example, at turn t, life_span L, after turn t completes, life_span becomes L-1. If L-1 >0, it stays, else disappears.\n\nSimilarly, it can be eaten during turn t if head moves to it.\n\nFor (1,1) at t=4, life_span=6: after turn 4, it will have life_span 5, then after turn 5, 4, etc., until after turn 9, life_span=1, after turn 10, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it is not present on turn 10? Let's define.\n\nAssume that at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L. During the turn, if head moves to it, it is eaten. After the turn, life_span decreases by 1. If after decrease it becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (1,1): at turn 4, L=6. After turn 4, L=5. ... After turn 9, L=1, after turn 9 decrease to L=0, disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, other food:\n\n(5,3): L=6 at t=4\n\n(4,1): L=7 at t=4\n\n(2,5): L=10 at t=4\n\nAll have value +1.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- U: to (3,4)\n\n- D: to (3,2)\n\n- L: to (2,3)\n\nI need to evaluate each option for immediate and future turns.\n\nAlso, food at (5,3) is close, but (5,3) is at x=5,y=3. Current head (3,3), so same y, different x. Moving right would be direct, but I can't move right because reverse is not allowed. From (3,3), moving right to (4,3) is not possible because reverse.\n\n(5,3) is two steps right, but I can't go directly.\n\nFood at (4,1) is down-left, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) all y, (x,0) all x, (x,7) all x.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo let's mark free cells.\n\nFor example, row y=3: x from 1 to 6, but obstacles? (2,4) is at y=4, not y=3; (3,5) at y=5. So for y=3, no internal obstacles listed, so free except borders, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so (1,3) to (6,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: obstacles (1,2) and (5,2), so (1,2) and (5,2) are blocked. Other cells like (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2) should be free, but (6,2) not listed, (x,0) wall, so y=2, x from 1 to 6 except (1,2) and (5,2) are obstacles, so free: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2)? (6,2) is not listed as obstacle, and not border, so yes.\n\nBut (6,1) is obstacle, but y=1, different.\n\ny=4: obstacles (2,4), (6,4), and (3,5) is y=5, so for y=4, (2,4) and (6,4) blocked, so free: (1,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (7,4) but x=7 wall, so (1,4) to (5,4) except (2,4), so (1,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4).\n\n(1,4) not listed obstacle, (3,4) not, etc.\n\nNow, snake positions: head (3,3), body (4,3)\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5)\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is on the same row y=3, x=5.\n\nBut from (3,3), to reach (5,3), I need to go right twice, but I can't move right now because reverse not allowed.\n\nIf I move left or up or down, I can go around.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is at (4,1), which is down from (4,3) or something.\n\nLet's think about paths to food.\n\nFirst, move L to (2,3): this is closer to (1,1) and (2,5), but (2,5) is up.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (2,2) or (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,3), but (3,3) is previous body, but after move, tail moves, so (3,3) might be free later.\n\nSimilarly, move U to (3,4): then I can go towards (2,5) or other.\n\nMove D to (3,2): then towards (4,1) or (1,1).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince the snake is short, eating food soon might be good to grow, but I have to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAlso, there's a risk with tail when eating food near tail.\n\nBut here, snake is only length 2, so tail is close.\n\nFor example, if I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, so if I eat, the new tail position is where the tail was, and head is on food.\n\nBut the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, for (5,3): (5,3) is food, and tail is at (4,3). Are head and tail adjacent? Head is at (3,3), tail at (4,3), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n\nIf I were to move to (4,3), but I can't because reverse not allowed, and also (4,3) is tail, but if I could move there, and if (4,3) had food, but (4,3) does not have food; food is at (5,3), not at (4,3).\n\nThe danger is when the food is on the tail cell itself.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, the food must be on the tail cell, and head must be adjacent to tail.\n\nIn this state, tail is at (4,3), and there is no food on (4,3). Food is at other places.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nFor example, (4,1) is food, but tail is at (4,3), not adjacent to head directly in terms of the food position.\n\nHead at (3,3), tail at (4,3), so they are adjacent.\n\nBut the food is not on tail cell; it's on (4,1), which is different.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, let's plan the moves.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 4, then turn 5, etc., but I think I need to decide the sequence for a few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from turn 4.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nSince the future depends on food and movements, I need to simulate possible paths.\n\nLet me denote the state.\n\nAt turn 4, snake positions: [(3,3), (4,3)], head dir L.\n\nPossible actions for turn 4: U, D, L.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3): new positions: head at (2,3), body at (3,3). Tail was at (4,3), but since no food, tail moves away, so new snake: [(2,3), (3,3)]. Head dir now L (since moved left).\n\nIf move U to (3,4): new snake [(3,4), (3,3)], head dir U.\n\nIf move D to (3,2): new snake [(3,2), (3,3)], head dir D.\n\nNow, from there, I can plan further.\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5)\n\n(5,3) is close but I can't reach it directly.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is below (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), if I move D to (3,2), then I am closer to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is at (2,5), which is up from (2,3) if I move left.\n\n(1,1) is at corner.\n\nAlso, life spans: all have several turns left, so not urgent.\n\n(4,1) has life span 7, so 7 turns including turn 4, so after turn 4, L=6, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), which is on the same row. If I can go right soon.\n\nBut I can't move right now, but next turn, if I move, say, up or down, then I can change direction.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,4), then at turn 5, head at (3,4), dir U, then I can move R to (4,4), for example, then to (5,4), then down to (5,3), but (5,3) might be eaten by then or something, but I need to see.\n\nSince I'm planning, I should consider the path.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the closest food or safest path.\n\nList distances.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (5,3): Manhattan distance |5-3| + |3-3| = 2, but I can't go directly right.\n\nTo (4,1): |4-3| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (2,5): |2-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (1,1): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n(5,3) is closest but not directly accessible.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), distance to (2,5) is |2-2| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2, and to (1,1) is |1-2| + |1-3| =1 +2=3\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), to (2,5) is |2-3| + |5-4| =1+1=2, to (5,3) is |5-3| + |3-4| =2+1=3, etc.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), to (4,1) is |4-3| + |1-2| =1+1=2, to (5,3) is |5-3| + |3-2| =2+1=3.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,1), which is close if I go down.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), and there is an obstacle at (5,1) and (5,2), so from (3,2), I can go to (4,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, so I can't go to (5,2), and (4,2) to (4,1) is down, but (4,1) is food, so I can eat it if I go to (4,1).\n\nBut let's see the grid around (4,1).\n\n(4,1): y=1, x=4.\n\nBorders: y=0 and y=1, but y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is not border, it's valid.\n\nObstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, (5,2) obstacle, and (1,2), etc.\n\nSo from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) but y=0 wall, so invalid, L to (3,1), R to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, so only U and L are possible from (4,1), but L to (3,1), and U to (4,2).\n\n(3,1) is free? x=3,y=1, not border, not obstacle listed, so yes.\n\nBut D to (4,0) invalid, R to (5,1) invalid, so only two ways out.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is above (4,1), (4,2) is free, no obstacle.\n\nFrom (4,2), can go U to (4,3), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so only U and L.\n\nSo the area around (4,1) is a bit constrained; it's like a dead end if I go down there.\n\nIf I eat (4,1), I grow, but then I am at (4,1) with only U and L to move, so I have to go to (4,2) or (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) might be free, then to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut it could be risky if I get trapped.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is corner, with walls at x=0 and y=0, so from (1,1), can only go U to (1,2) or R to (2,1), but (1,2) is obstacle! (1,2) is internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nFood at (1,1): (1,1) is at x=1,y=1.\n\nBorders: x=0, y=0 walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,2) blocked.\n\nFrom (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2) but obstacle, invalid; D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; L to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid; R to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is free? x=2,y=1, not border, not in obstacles (obstacles include (2,4) but not (2,1)), so (2,1) free.\n\nSo from (1,1), only possible move is R to (2,1). Only one way out.\n\nIf I eat (1,1), I grow, but then I am stuck at (1,1) with only one exit to (2,1), which might be dangerous if the snake is longer, but for now short, it might be okay, but long-term, it's a risk.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is near obstacle (2,4) and (3,5).\n\n(2,5): y=5, x=2.\n\nObstacles: (2,4) is below, (3,5) is right.\n\nBorders: none directly.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid; L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (2,6) and L to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) free? x=1,y=5, not border, not obstacle, so yes.\n\n(2,6) free.\n\nSo two ways out.\n\n(5,3) at (5,3): x=5,y=3.\n\nNear obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,3), moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid; L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) free? x=6,y=3, not border, obstacles (6,1), (6,4), not (6,3), so free.\n\nSo from (5,3), can go U, L, R. D invalid because (5,2) obstacle.\n\nNow, back to turn 4.\n\nI need to choose a move that allows me to access food safely and avoid dead ends.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can afford to go to (4,1) or (1,1), but be careful.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,3) is on the same row, and I can reach it in a few turns if I change direction.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,4) at turn 4.\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,4), head dir U, so can move U, L, R (not D reverse).\n\nIf move R to (4,4), for example.\n\nThen turn 6, from (4,4), can go to (5,4) or other.\n\nThen to (5,3) down.\n\nBut (5,3) might be eaten by then? No, only me, I think, since it's single player.\n\nThe state doesn't mention other snakes, so I think it's single snake.\n\nSo food stays until eaten or expired.\n\nSo (5,3) has life span 6 at t=4, so it will be there for several turns.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, option: move L at turn 4 to (2,3).\n\nThen snake at [(2,3), (3,3)], head dir L.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,3), dir L, so can move L, U, D (not R reverse).\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) free? x=1,y=3, not border, not obstacle, yes.\n\nU to (2,4): but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\nD to (2,2): (2,2) free.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (1,3) or D to (2,2). U invalid.\n\nIf move L to (1,3), then at (1,3), dir L.\n\nThen turn 6, from (1,3), can move L to (0,3) but x=0 wall, invalid; U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid; R to (2,3) but (2,3) is previous body? At turn 6, positions: if I moved to (1,3) at turn 5, snake [(1,3), (2,3)], then at turn 6, if I move, head to new position, tail to (1,3)? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 4: move L to (2,3), snake: [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move L to (1,3), snake: [(1,3), (2,3)]  // head at (1,3), body at (2,3)\n\nNow turn 6, from (1,3), dir L (since moved left), possible moves: L to (0,3) wall invalid; U to (1,4); D to (1,2) obstacle invalid; R to (2,3) which is current body position.\n\nBut R to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied by body, but it's the tail segment? Positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), so (2,3) is the only body segment, which is the tail.\n\nCan I move to (2,3)? Yes, because it's the tail, and after move, tail moves away.\n\nIf I move R to (2,3), new head at (2,3), and the body moves to (1,3), so new snake [(2,3), (1,3)], but that might be messy, but no collision.\n\nThen head dir R.\n\nBut I have food at (1,1), so from (1,3), I could move D, but D to (1,2) invalid, so only U or R.\n\nIf move U to (1,4) at turn 5? At turn 5, from (2,3), I could move U, but U to (2,4) obstacle, invalid, so only L or D.\n\nIf at turn 5 I move D to (2,2) instead.\n\nFrom (2,3), move D to (2,2), snake [(2,2), (2,3)]? After move: head to (2,2), body to (2,3)? Previous was [(2,3),(3,3)], head to (2,2), so new positions: [(2,2), (2,3)], head dir D.\n\nThen turn 6, from (2,2), dir D, can move D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle invalid, R to (3,2), U to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, can move to it since tail.\n\nBut U to (2,3) would be reverse? Current dir D, moving U is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed, so cannot move U.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,1), or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is free, (3,2) free.\n\nIf move D to (2,1), then closer to (1,1), but (1,1) is at (1,1), from (2,1) I can go L to (1,1).\n\nBut as I said, (1,1) is a dead end almost.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nOption 2: move U at turn 4 to (3,4).\n\nThen snake [(3,4), (3,3)], head dir U.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4), dir U, can move U to (3,5), but (3,5) is obstacle! (3,5) internal obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (4,4), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body position.\n\nD to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by body, which is the tail segment, so can move there, but moving D is opposite to current U, so instant reverse not allowed. Current dir U, moving D is reverse, so cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,4)? U and L invalid, D invalid reverse, so only R to (4,4).\n\nIs that right?\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut U to (3,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (3,3) is body, but since tail, can move, but moving D is reverse to current U, so not allowed.\n\nR to (4,4) is possible, (4,4) free.\n\nSo only one choice: move R to (4,4) at turn 5.\n\nThen snake [(4,4), (3,4)], head dir R.\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4), dir R, can move R to (5,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, can move but reverse? Current dir R, moving L is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: R to (5,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is free now, since tail moved.\n\n(5,4) free, (4,5) free.\n\nThen I can go to (5,4), then to (5,3) down, but need to see if D is possible later.\n\nBut from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) at turn 6.\n\n(4,3) is the previous position, but it's free now.\n\nThen at (4,3), I can go to (5,3) if possible.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 4, if I move U, then at turn 5 I must move R to (4,4), no choice.\n\nThen at turn 6, I have options.\n\nBut I need to think about food.\n\n(5,3) is below, so from (4,4), moving D to (4,3) would be good to reach (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is to the left.\n\nBut let's see the third option for turn 4: move D to (3,2).\n\nThen snake [(3,2), (3,3)], head dir D.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), dir D, can move D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), U to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, can move but reverse not allowed (current dir D, moving U reverse).\n\nSo possible: D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\n(3,1) free, (2,2) free, (4,2) free.\n\nThen I can go towards (4,1) or other.\n\nFor example, if move R to (4,2) at turn 5, then to (4,1) down.\n\nBut (4,1) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nLet's compare the options.\n\nFirst, if I move L at turn 4 to (2,3), then I can go towards (2,5) or (1,1), but both have risks.\n\nIf I move U at turn 4 to (3,4), then I am forced to move R to (4,4) at turn 5, then at turn 6 I can move to (5,4) or (4,3) or (4,5), and from there to (5,3) or other.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), from (4,4) I can move D to (4,3) at turn 6, then at (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) to eat, but at turn 6, head at (4,4), dir R, move D to (4,3), but moving D is not reverse? Current dir R, moving D is not opposite; opposite would be L. So moving D is allowed, it's a turn.\n\nSo from (4,4), move D to (4,3), new dir D.\n\nThen at (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,4) first, then D to (5,3).\n\nBut moving directly to (4,3) is faster.\n\nNow, at turn 6, if I move to (4,3), then turn 7 move to (5,3) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4)  // must, as only choice\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)  // to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,3), head dir D (since moved down), can move D to (4,2), but (4,2) is free? (4,2) not obstacle, yes.\n\nOr L to (3,3), R to (5,3), U to (4,4) but reverse if dir D, moving U reverse not allowed.\n\nCurrent dir D, so can move D, L, R.\n\nR to (5,3) to eat food.\n\nYes.\n\nSo by turn 7, I can eat (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved differently, it might take longer.\n\nNow, for move D at turn 4 to (3,2), then I can go to (4,1) faster.\n\nFor example, turn 4 move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5 move R to (4,2)  // for example\n\nThen turn 6 move D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nSo by turn 6, eat (4,1).\n\n(4,1) has value 1, same as (5,3).\n\nBut (4,1) is in a constrained area, as I said earlier.\n\nAfter eating at (4,1), snake grows to length 3, positions: after eating, head at (4,1), body includes previous head and the new segment.\n\nWhen you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nAt turn 6, if I move to (4,1) and eat, then new positions: head at (4,1), and the body is the previous head position and the segment before.\n\nBefore move, at turn 6, say positions: [(4,2), (3,2)] or something.\n\nAssume turn 4: move D to (3,2), snake [(3,2), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,2), snake [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1), which is food, so eat it, snake grows: head at (4,1), body: (4,2) and (3,2), so positions [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead dir D (since moved down).\n\nNow from (4,1), as before, only possible moves: U to (4,2), but (4,2) is now body, so moving to body cell except tail.\n\n(4,2) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is at (3,2).\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), it is occupied by body, so collision, die.\n\nCannot move U to (4,2).\n\nD to (4,0) wall invalid.\n\nL to (3,1), R to (5,1) obstacle invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,1).\n\nMust move L to (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,1), dir L (since moved left).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,2) or other, but (3,2) is tail? Let's see.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), new positions: head at (3,1), body: (4,1) and (4,2)? No.\n\nPrevious positions before move: [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nMove L to (3,1), eat? (3,1) may not have food, so no eat, so new head at (3,1), tail moves away, so new positions: head (3,1), then body (4,1), and tail (4,2)? Standard: when no eat, tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n\nPositions: after moving head to new cell, the tail cell is removed.\n\nSo from [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)], move head to (3,1), no food, so new positions: head at (3,1), then the first body segment at (4,1), and the second at (4,2)? The segments: head was at (4,1), moves to (3,1), so new head (3,1). The body segments: the previous body was (4,2) and (3,2). Since no growth, the tail (3,2) is removed, and the body moves: (4,2) becomes the segment after head, and (3,2) is gone.\n\nSo new snake: [(3,1), (4,1)]? Let's index.\n\nPositions list: index 0: head, 1: body, 2: tail.\n\nBefore move: [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2) ]  // head, body, tail\n\nMove head to (3,1), no food, so new head: (3,1)\n\nThen the body: the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,1), but since head moved, the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,1)? No.\n\nStandard: the head moves to new cell. Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nSo after head moves to (3,1), the segment that was at (4,2) moves to the previous position of the head, which is (4,1). The segment that was at (3,2) moves to (4,2). But since no growth, the tail (last segment) is removed, so only two segments: head at (3,1), and body at (4,1).\n\nThe tail (3,2) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(3,1), (4,1)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move, etc.\n\nBut I was at (4,1) which was risky, and I had to move to (3,1) to escape.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone to (1,1), it would be worse.\n\nWhereas for (5,3), it's less constrained.\n\nSo probably better to go for (5,3).\n\nMoreover, (5,3) is closer in terms of accessibility.\n\nNow, for the move U at turn 4, I can reach (5,3) by turn 7.\n\nIf I move D at turn 4, I can reach (4,1) by turn 6, but it's risky.\n\nIf I move L at turn 4, I can go to (2,5) or something.\n\nFor example, turn 4 move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 5, from (2,3), I can move U? But U to (2,4) obstacle, invalid. So only L or D.\n\nIf move L to (1,3), as before.\n\nThen turn 6, from (1,3), can move U to (1,4) (since D and L invalid, R to (2,3) possible but to tail).\n\nMove U to (1,4).\n\nThen to (1,5), etc., to reach (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), from (1,4) I can go to (1,5) then to (2,5), but (2,5) might be eaten.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) has life span 10, so plenty.\n\nBut (5,3) can be reached sooner via the U-R-D path.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating sooner might be better to grow, but with the risk.\n\nBut in this case, (5,3) seems safer.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) has life span 7, so if I don't eat it now, it might be available later, but I can eat (5,3) first.\n\nSimilarly, all food is positive.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, after eating, I need to have space to move.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), snake grows to length 3, then I can move to other areas.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), after eating, head at (5,3), then I can go to (5,4) or (6,3) or (4,3), but (4,3) might be body.\n\nLet's simulate the sequence to (5,3).\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4)  // head to (3,4), dir U\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4)  // must, dir R now\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)  // to (4,3), dir D\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3)  // eat food, grow to length 3\n\nAfter turn 7: ate at (5,3), so snake positions: before move, at turn 7, positions [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4)]? Let's trace.\n\nStart turn 4: after move U: snake [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4): head to (4,4), body to (3,4), so [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3): head to (4,3), body to (4,4), so [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3): (5,3) is food, so eat, head to (5,3), body: since eat, tail doesn't move, so body segments: the previous head position (4,3) becomes body, and (4,4) remains, so new positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nHead dir R.\n\nNow, from (5,3), I can move: U to (5,4), L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied, cannot move there (unless tail, but it's not tail; tail is at (4,4)).\n\n(4,3) is the second segment, not tail.\n\nD to (5,2) obstacle invalid.\n\nR to (6,3).\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nNot L or D.\n\nThen I can go to (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, the grid has space.\n\nNow, other food like (2,5) is still there, life span 10, so I can go there later.\n\n(4,1) is also there.\n\nSo this seems reasonable.\n\nIf I had gone down to (4,1), I might get stuck temporarily.\n\nTherefore, for turn 4, I should move U.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output the actions.\n\nBut I need to output for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? From turn 4 to, say, turn 8 or more.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from turn 4.\n\nIn the sequence above, by turn 7 I eat food, so I can plan beyond.\n\nSince after turn 7, I have choices, but I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the answer, I should list actions for turn 4,5,6,7,... as per plan.\n\nBut the future may depend, so I should define a plan.\n\nSince the state might change with food disappearing, but I need to commit to actions.\n\nIn this case, no new food spawns mentioned, I think only existing food.\n\nThe problem doesn't say new food spawns, so only these four food items, I assume.\n\nSo I can plan based on current state.\n\nFor the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 6: D (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 7: R (to (5,3), eat food)\n\nNow turn 8: from (5,3), as above, can move U or R.\n\nSay, move U to (5,4) for example.\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about other food.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is far, but I can head there.\n\n(4,1) is below, but might be constrained.\n\nSince I grew, I can explore.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should aim for next food.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,3), at turn 8, from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), then to (5,5), etc., towards (2,5).\n\nOr move R to (6,3), then to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, so not.\n\n(6,4) obstacle, so from (6,3), can go U to (6,4) invalid, or other.\n\nBetter to go up.\n\n(2,5) has long life span, (4,1) has life span 7 at t=4, after 4 turns, at turn 8, life span: at t=4, L=7, after t=4, L=6; t=5, L=5; t=6, L=4; t=7, L=3; after turn 7, L=2 for (4,1)? Let's track.\n\nAt turn t, before action, food has life_span.\n\nAfter turn, it decreases.\n\nAt turn 4 start, (4,1) L=7\n\nAfter turn 4, L=6\n\nAfter turn 5, L=5\n\nAfter turn 6, L=4\n\nAfter turn 7, L=3\n\nSo at turn 8, L=3, still available.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) L=6 at t=4, after t=4, L=5; t=5,L=4; t=6,L=3; t=7,L=2; turn 8 L=2.\n\n(2,5) L=10, plenty.\n\nSo (4,1) can be eaten later if I want.\n\nBut it's constrained, so maybe avoid.\n\n(2,5) is better.\n\nSo from (5,3), at turn 8, move U to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,4), dir U (since moved up), can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4) but (4,4) may be body? Current positions at turn 8.\n\nAfter turn 7: snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,4), but (5,4) is free? Yes, but when I move, if no food, tail moves.\n\n(5,4) no food, so move to (5,4), new head (5,4), body: (5,3) and (4,3)? Previous head (5,3) to (5,4), so body: (4,3) moves to (5,3), and (4,4) moves to (4,3)? Positions: before move, [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nMove head to (5,4), no food (assume), so new positions: head (5,4), then body: the first body segment moves to previous head (5,3), so (5,3) now body, then the second body segment moves to previous position of first body, which was (4,3), but since no growth, tail (4,4) is removed.\n\nSo new: [ (5,4), (5,3) ]? Let's see: segments: index 0 head to (5,4), index 1 was (4,3) moves to where index 0 was, (5,3), index 2 was (4,4) moves to where index 1 was, (4,3), but since no growth, we remove the last position, so the new positions are [ (5,4), (5,3) ] and (4,3) is added? No.\n\nStandard: the head moves to new cell. Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo segment 1 (was at (4,3)) moves to where segment 0 was ( (5,3) ).\n\nSegment 2 (was at (4,4)) moves to where segment 1 was ( (4,3) ).\n\nBut since no growth, we do not add a new segment, so the last position (where segment 2 was) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: segment 0 at (5,4), segment 1 at (5,3), and segment 2 position (4,3) is where it moved to? Segment 1 moves to (5,3), segment 2 moves to (4,3), so positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]? But (4,3) is occupied by segment 2.\n\nIn this case, from [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ], head to (5,4), so:\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 1 (was (4,3)) moves to previous head position (5,3)\n\n- Segment 2 (was (4,4)) moves to previous segment 1 position (4,3)\n\n- The previous segment 2 position (4,4) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nYes.\n\nNow head dir U.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), dir U, can move U to (5,5), D reverse not allowed, L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle invalid.\n\nSo possible U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is free now? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen I can move to (5,5) or (4,4).\n\nTo go towards (2,5), moving left and up.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,4) at turn 9.\n\nThen to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output up to turn 8 or so.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, output the actions.\n\nFor turn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R (to eat (5,3))\n\nThen for turn 8, say U to (5,4)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 7, I ate, so for future, I can choose.\n\nSince (2,5) is a target, from (5,4) at turn 8, I can move L to (4,4), but at turn 8 positions.\n\nAt turn 7 end: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,4), positions as above [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), move L to (4,4), (4,4) free, so move to (4,4), new positions: head to (4,4), body: (5,4) moves to (5,4)? Previous head (5,4) to (4,4), segment 1 (5,3) moves to (5,4), segment 2 (4,3) moves to (5,3), tail removed? New: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen turn 10, from (4,4), can move to (3,4) or (4,5) or (4,3), etc.\n\nTowards (2,5).\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can stop after a few actions, as long as I have 5 turns or so.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn 8 is 5 actions: turn4,5,6,7,8.\n\nTurns: t4, t5, t6, t7, t8 — that's 5 turns.\n\nAnd I thought ahead to eating food.\n\nSimilarly, I can include turn 9 if needed.\n\nBut I think for now.\n\nIn the beginning, there is food at (1,1) and (2,5), but I chose (5,3).\n\nBut (2,5) might be reachable faster? From (3,3), if I move U to (3,4), then to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, so I have to go right, then up, etc., similar.\n\nIf I move L at turn 4, to (2,3), then I can only go down or left, not directly up to (2,5) because (2,4) blocked.\n\nSo from (2,3), move D to (2,2), then to (2,1), etc., or move L to (1,3), then to (1,4), (1,5), then to (2,5).\n\nFor example, turn 4: L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 5: L to (1,3) (since U invalid)\n\nTurn 6: U to (1,4) (only choice)\n\nTurn 7: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 8: R to (2,5) to eat, but (2,5) is food, so eat.\n\nBy turn 8, eat (2,5).\n\nCompared to eating (5,3) at turn 7.\n\nSlightly later, and (2,5) has same value.\n\nBut in the first plan, I eat at turn 7.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,5), from (2,5), only U or L, as before.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nBut since (5,3) is reachable earlier, I think the first plan is better.\n\nMoreover, in the D move, (4,1) is risky.\n\nSo I think moving U at turn 4 is best.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nFor turn 8, I can add U, for example.\n\nSince after turn 7, I have options, but I need to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output until turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut to be concise, I'll do until turn 8.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nAnd in the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I evaluated possible moves from the current state (turn 4) by thinking at least 5 turns ahead. The snake must avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body (except the tail, which moves). Food should be prioritized based on accessibility, value, and remaining life span, while avoiding risky positions like dead ends.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 4)**:\n  - Snake head at (3,3), direction left (L), body at (4,3). Length is 2.\n  - Food: All positive (+1 value). Closest is (5,3) at distance 2, but direct right move is blocked due to reverse direction constraint.\n  - Move options from (3,3) with dir L: U (to (3,4)), D (to (3,2)), L (to (2,3)). R is invalid (instant reverse).\n- **Food Analysis**:\n  - (5,3): Life span 6 at turn 4, disappears after turn 9. Accessible via a path (e.g., U-R-D-R) by turn 7. Less constrained area, safer post-eating options.\n  - (4,1): Life span 7, but in a dead-end area (only exits U or L). Eating it risks temporary trapping (e.g., only move to (3,1) after eating). Not ideal for long-term survival.\n  - (2,5): Life span 10, but farther. Path via L from (3,3) is longer and blocked by obstacles (e.g., (2,4) obstacle).\n  - (1,1): Life span 6, corner with only one exit (R to (2,1)), high risk of trapping.\n- **Path Selection**:\n  - **Optimal path to (5,3)**: Move U (turn 4) to avoid dead ends and reach (5,3) safely by turn 7. This path uses turns to change direction legally and avoids obstacles.\n  - **Turn-by-turn simulation** (5+ turns):\n    - Turn 4: Move U to (3,4). Now head dir U.\n    - Turn 5: Must move R (only legal move, as U to (3,5) obstacle, L to (2,4) obstacle, D reverse invalid). To (4,4), dir R.\n    - Turn 6: Move D to (4,3). Legal (not reverse; dir R, D is turn). Now dir D.\n    - Turn 7: Move R to (5,3) to eat food. Grow to length 3. Now dir R.\n    - Turn 8: Move U to (5,4) to explore open area toward (2,5) (long-life food). Safer than moving toward constrained (4,1).\n  - **Why this sequence?**\n    - Eats (5,3) by turn 7, scoring +1 and growing early.\n    - Avoids (4,1) and (1,1) dead ends, ensuring mobility.\n    - After eating, path to (2,5) is open (e.g., via (5,4) → (4,4) → (3,4) → ...).\n    - All moves are legal: no wall/obstacle collisions, no body collisions (tail moves), no instant reverse.\n- **Long-term Survival**: After turn 8, the snake can target (2,5) (life span 10) or other food. Grid has space to maneuver (e.g., from (5,4), options include U to (5,5) or L to (4,4)). Avoiding (4,1) reduces risk.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe planned actions for turns 4 to 8 (5 turns) are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U (up)  \nTurn 5: R (right)  \nTurn 6: D (down)  \nTurn 7: R (right)  \nTurn 8: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. So the grid is 8 units wide and 8 high, with coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). I should list all wall cells to avoid.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (3,4), body at (3,3). So the snake has only two segments, meaning it's short. Head direction is Up, which is increasing y, so from (3,3) to (3,4) is moving up.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 5 (so disappears after turn 5 + 5 = turn 10? Wait, life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, life span 5 means it has 5 turns left, including turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after turn T + L - 1? Example: if life span is 5 at turn 5, after turn 5, countdown to 4, then 3,2,1,0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So with life span L, it lasts for L turns, from turn T to turn T + L - 1 inclusive? At turn T, life span is L, meaning it has L turns left including T, so it will be present until turn T + L - 1, and gone at turn T + L.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value). For (1,1): (1,1,5,1) at turn 5, so life span 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1 = turn 9? Let's not overcomplicate; I'll keep track of remaining life.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (1,1,5,1) : position (1,1), value +1, life span 5 at turn 5\n\n- (5,3,5,1) : (5,3), +1, life span 5\n\n- (4,1,6,1) : (4,1), +1, life span 6\n\n- (2,5,9,1) : (2,5), +1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so no negative food here. That's good; I only need to eat positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. Since the snake is short, growing is important, but survival first.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,4), direction Up. From (3,3) to (3,4) was up, so current direction is Up.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down, so I cannot move Down next. I can move Up, Left, or Right.\n\nNow, the grid: Let me sketch a mental map.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nList: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake: head (3,4), tail (3,3)\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5)\n\nNow, at turn 5, I need to choose action for turn 5.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R (not D)\n\nMove Up: to (3,5)\n\nBut (3,5) is an internal obstacle? (3,5) is in the wall list: internal obstacles include (3,5), yes. So (3,5) is a wall, I cannot move there. Moving Up to (3,5) would cause collision with wall, death.\n\nSo Up is not possible.\n\nMove Left: to (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is also an internal obstacle? Walls include (2,4), yes. So (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nMove Right: to (4,4)\n\nWhat is (4,4)? Not in walls, and not occupied by snake or food? Snake is at (3,4) and (3,3), so (4,4) should be empty.\n\nFood positions are (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5), so (4,4) has no food.\n\nSo moving Right to (4,4) seems possible.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nCurrent possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,5) - wall, invalid\n\n- Down: opposite direction, not allowed\n\n- Left: (2,4) - wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (4,4) - empty, possible\n\nSo only possible move is Right to (4,4)?\n\nThat can't be right; there must be other options. What about the direction constraint?\n\nHead is at (3,4), came from (3,3), so direction is Up. Moving Down would be reverse, not allowed. Moving Left or Right should be possible, but both Left and Up are walls? Let's confirm the positions.\n\n(3,4) to Up: (3,5) - wall\n\nTo Down: (3,3) - but (3,3) is the tail. Rule: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward. So moving to (3,3) might be possible.\n\nLet me check the collision rules.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that is the current tail, and the tail moves away, it's safe, as long as no other body part is there.\n\nHere, snake is only two segments: head (3,4) and tail (3,3). If I move Down to (3,3), which is the tail, then after move, head moves to (3,3), and tail moves away? When I move, the snake moves: head to new position, and each segment follows, so tail position is vacated.\n\nSpecifically: if I move Down to (3,3), the new head position is (3,3), which was the tail. Then the tail segment is removed? No, in Snake, when you move without eating, the tail moves, so the segment at (3,3) is no longer part of the snake; the new tail becomes the previous body segment.\n\nCurrent snake: positions [(3,4), (3,3)] so index 0 head, index 1 tail.\n\nIf I move to a new position, say to cell P.\n\nIf P is not food, then head moves to P, and tail is removed, so new positions: [P, (3,4)] but since I moved to (3,3), P = (3,3), so new head at (3,3), and body at (3,4). But (3,3) was the tail, now it's head, and (3,4) is now the only body segment.\n\nPositions: new head at (3,3), and the segment that was head is now body at (3,4), and the old tail (3,3) is gone? Let's think.\n\nStandard Snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, the tail is removed (snake doesn't grow).\n\n- If food, the tail stays (snake grows by one).\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,3), which is the current tail position.\n\n(3,3) has no food? Food is at (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5), not at (3,3).\n\nSo, if I move to (3,3), which is empty? But it's occupied by tail.\n\nAccording to rule: I can move to tail cell because the tail will move.\n\nWhen I move head to (3,3), since (3,3) was tail, and I'm moving to it, but it's not food, so after move, the new snake positions: head is now at (3,3), and the body is at (3,4), but since no food, the tail (which was at (3,3)) is removed, so the snake now has only one segment? That can't be right.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard Snake: the snake consists of segments. When the head moves to a new cell, that cell becomes the new head. If the new cell is not food, the tail cell is vacated (removed from the snake). So the snake moves forward by one cell.\n\nIn this case, snake is two cells: head at A=(3,4), tail at B=(3,3).\n\nIf I move head to a new cell C.\n\nIf C is not food, then new head at C, new tail at A (since B is removed), so positions [C, A].\n\nIf C is food, new head at C, and tail remains B, so positions [C, A, B], snake grows.\n\nNow, if C is the current tail position, which is B=(3,3).\n\nSo move head to C=B=(3,3).\n\nSince C is not food (assuming), new head at (3,3), and new tail at A=(3,4), so snake positions: [(3,3), (3,4)].\n\nBut (3,3) was the tail, now it's head, and (3,4) is body.\n\nThe cell (3,3) was occupied, but when we move to it, it's okay because the tail leaves it.\n\nIn terms of collision, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away at the same time, so no collision.\n\nIf I move to any other body cell, it would be collision, but tail is okay.\n\nIn this case, with only two segments, moving to tail is like turning around, but since no instant reverse restriction only applies to direction, not to position.\n\nHere, current direction is Up, from (3,3) to (3,4). Moving Down to (3,3) is moving opposite to current direction, which is not allowed because of no instant reverse.\n\nAh, that's the point.\n\n\" No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is Up, so moving Down is opposite, not allowed.\n\nTherefore, for turn 5, I cannot move Down to (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, Up to (3,5) is wall, Left to (2,4) is wall, so only possible move is Right to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is within bounds? x=4, y=4, x from 0-7, y from 0-7, not border, not in internal walls: internal walls are (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4). (4,4) not in list, so empty.\n\nNo food at (4,4), so moving there is safe.\n\nSo for turn 5, action must be R (Right) to (4,4).\n\nThen snake moves: head to (4,4), tail removed? Since no food eaten, tail at (3,3) is removed, new positions: head (4,4), body (3,4) but (3,4) was the previous head, now body.\n\nNew snake: [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nAnd head direction: since moved Right, new direction is Right.\n\nNow, turn 6.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns, but since I have to output actions for several turns, I should think ahead.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns or more.\n\nBut the state might change due to food disappearing, but I need to simulate based on current info.\n\nFood life spans decrease each turn.\n\nAt turn 5:\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,1): life span 5, so at turn 5, it has 5 turns left. After turn 5, life span 4, and so on, until turn 9 it is present, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (5,3): life span 5, present until turn 9\n\n- (4,1): life span 6, present until turn 10 (since turn 5:6, t6:5, t7:4, t8:3, t9:2, t10:1, t11 gone? At turn T, life span L, it will be there for L turns, so from turn T to T+L-1.\n\nAt turn 5, (1,1) life span 5: present at turns 5,6,7,8,9. Gone at turn 10.\n\n(5,3) life span 5: turns 5-9\n\n(4,1) life span 6: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10. Gone turn 11.\n\n(2,5) life span 9: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Gone turn 14.\n\nNow, after turn 5 move to (4,4), snake at [(4,4), (3,4)], direction Right.\n\nTurn 6:\n\nPossible moves: current direction Right, so cannot move Left (opposite). Can move Right, Up, Down.\n\nHead at (4,4)\n\nMove Right: to (5,4)\n\nWhat is (5,4)? Not border, internal walls: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,4) not listed, so should be empty. No food, so safe.\n\nMove Up: to (4,5)\n\n(4,5): y=5, x=4, not border, not in walls, empty.\n\nMove Down: to (4,3)\n\n(4,3): not border, not wall, empty? Food at (5,3) but (4,3) no food.\n\nBut (4,3) might be accessible.\n\nI need to think about getting food.\n\nFood at (4,1), which is below, and (5,3) to the right, (1,1) left-down, (2,5) up-left.\n\nSnake at (4,4), so (4,1) is at same x, y=1, so down.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3, so right and down.\n\n(2,5) at x=2,y=5, left and up.\n\n(1,1) far away.\n\nAlso, (4,1) has longer life, 6 turns, so I have time.\n\nBut since snake is short, eating food soon is good, but avoid risks.\n\nNow, for turn 6, from (4,4), I can move to (5,4), (4,5), or (4,3).\n\nMoving to (4,3) is Down.\n\nIf I move Down to (4,3), that gets me closer to (4,1) or (5,3).\n\n(4,3) to (4,1) is two steps down, but there might be obstacles.\n\nFirst, from (4,4) to (4,3): cell (4,3) is empty, no food.\n\nThen new snake: head (4,3), body (4,4)\n\nDirection Down.\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,3), can move Down to (4,2), or Left to (3,3), or Right to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) has food! Value +1.\n\nIf I move Right to (5,3) on turn 7, I can eat the food.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom turn 6: if I move Down to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,3), current direction Down, so cannot move Up. Can move Down, Left, Right.\n\nMove Right to (5,3): (5,3) has food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\n(5,3) is not wall, yes.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nTail is at (4,4) at turn 6? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 5 end: snake at [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move to, say, (4,3)\n\nSince no food at (4,3), new head at (4,3), new tail: since no growth, tail removed, so body is (4,4), but (3,4) is removed? Positions: old head (4,4) becomes body, old tail (3,4) is removed.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,4)\n\nNow, (4,4) is body, not tail anymore.\n\nDirection: moved Down, so direction Down.\n\nTurn 7: move Right to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) has food, so eat it. New head at (5,3), and since food, tail not removed, so new positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), and the previous body (4,4) remains, so snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nNow, length increased to 3.\n\nDirection now Right.\n\nFood at (5,3) is eaten, so removed.\n\nBut life span was 5, at turn 5, so at turn 7, it had 3 turns left, but eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, after eating, snake is at (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nHead at (5,3), direction Right.\n\nNow, possible moves: can go Up, Down, Right (not Left, opposite).\n\nBut (5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nWalls: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6) are walls, but (5,3) not wall, but around:\n\nUp to (5,4): (5,4) not wall, should be empty.\n\nDown to (5,2): (5,2) is internal wall, cannot move there.\n\nRight to (6,3): (6,3) not border? x=6, y=3. Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,3) not border. Internal walls: (6,1), (6,4), but (6,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nLeft to (4,3): but (4,3) is the body! Current positions: head (5,3), body (4,3) and (4,4). So (4,3) is the first body segment, not tail.\n\nMoving Left to (4,3) would be collision with body, since (4,3) is occupied and not tail.\n\nTail is at (4,4), but (4,3) is body.\n\nSo cannot move Left to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, Down to (5,2) is wall.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (5,4) or Right to (6,3).\n\nNow, (5,4): is it safe? Not wall, empty.\n\n(6,3): not wall, empty.\n\nBut there is a wall at (6,4), but (6,3) is different.\n\nAlso, food at (4,1) below, but I'm at (5,3), and (5,2) is wall, so I cannot go down to (5,2), so to reach (4,1), I need to go left or something.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go Up to (5,4) or Right to (6,3).\n\nIf I go Right to (6,3), then I'm near (6,4) wall, which might be risky.\n\n(6,4) is wall, so from (6,3), I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but Right to (7,3) is border wall, x=7.\n\n(7,3) is border, wall.\n\nDown to (6,2): (6,2) not wall? Walls: (6,1) wall, (6,4) wall, but (6,2) and (6,3) should be free, but (6,1) is wall, so (6,2) might be free, but let's list all walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,1), (6,4) are walls, so (6,2) and (6,3) are not walls, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1), (5,2) walls, so (5,3) is free, but (5,2) wall, so from (5,3), cannot go down.\n\nBack to turn 6 choices.\n\nAt turn 6, from (4,4), I could go other ways.\n\nFor example, go Right to (5,4) instead of Down.\n\nThen at turn 6: move to (5,4), no food, new snake: head (5,4), body (4,4)\n\nDirection Right.\n\nThen turn 7: from (5,4), can move Up, Down, Right (not Left).\n\n(5,4): y=4, x=5.\n\nMove Up to (5,5): (5,5) not wall, empty.\n\nMove Down to (5,3): (5,3) has food, and it's not wall.\n\nMove Right to (6,4): but (6,4) is internal wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo possible: Up to (5,5) or Down to (5,3).\n\nIf move Down to (5,3), eat food, grow to three segments.\n\nThen snake: head (5,3), body (5,4), and (4,4)? Positions: after move to (5,3), food eaten, so new positions: head (5,3), previous head (5,4) becomes body, and previous body (4,4) remains, so [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nDirection Down.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nNow, at (5,3), cannot go down to (5,2) wall, cannot go left to (4,3) if it's body, but in this case, body is at (5,4) and (4,4), so (4,3) is empty? (4,3) not occupied, so can go left to (4,3).\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom above: after eating at (5,3), snake at [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nHead (5,3), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves: Down to (5,2) wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (4,3): (4,3) empty, no food, so can move.\n\nUp to (5,4): but (5,4) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nRight to (6,3): empty, can move.\n\nSo can go Left to (4,3) or Right to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is closer to (4,1) food.\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, so from (4,3) down to (4,2), then (4,1).\n\n(4,2) : is it wall? Internal walls: (1,2), (5,2), etc. (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nThen (4,1) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) life span 6, at turn 5, so at turn 7, it has 4 turns left? Turn 5: life 6, turn 6:5, turn 7:4, etc.\n\nBut I need to plan from turn 5.\n\nBack to turn 5, I have to move Right to (4,4).\n\nThen for turn 6, I need to choose action.\n\nOptions at turn 6 from (4,4):\n\n- Down to (4,3)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Right to (5,4)\n\nI should consider the food.\n\n(4,1) is below, at (4,1), which is two steps down from (4,4): (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1), but (4,1) is food, so if I go directly down, I can eat on turn 7 or 8.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,3) on turn 6, then turn 7 to (4,2), then turn 8 to (4,1) eat.\n\n(4,1) life span 6 at turn 5, so at turn 8, it has 3 turns left? Turn 5:6, t6:5, t7:4, t8:3, so at turn 8 it is present, I can eat.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is to the right-down, at (5,3), which I can reach faster.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I go Right to (5,4) on turn 6, then Down to (5,3) on turn 7 to eat.\n\nOr from (4,4) go Down to (4,3) on turn 6, then Right to (5,3) on turn 7 to eat.\n\nBoth ways I can eat (5,3) on turn 7.\n\n(5,3) life span 5 at turn 5, so at turn 7, it has 3 turns left, fine.\n\nNow, (4,1) is also available, but it's lower, and there might be walls below.\n\n(5,1) and (5,2) are walls, but (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, not wall.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger, but not applicable yet.\n\nAnother food at (2,5), which is up-left, at (2,5), and (1,1) far.\n\n(2,5) has long life, 9 turns, so no rush.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nLook at the walls: there are many internal obstacles, like at x=5, y=1,2 are walls, x=6 y=1,4 walls, etc.\n\nAlso, (3,5) wall, (2,4) wall, etc.\n\nThe area around (4,4) seems open.\n\nIf I go down to (4,3), I might get closer to (4,1), but after eating (4,1), I need to get out.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go up or left/right, but y=1, border y=0 below, so only up, left, right.\n\nLeft to (3,1), right to (5,1), but (5,1) is wall, so from (4,1), can go to (3,1) or (4,2) up or (5,1) but (5,1) wall, so only (3,1) or (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is above, to (4,2), then to (4,3) etc.\n\nBut (4,2) should be free, as not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) not wall, I think.\n\nWalls at (1,2), (2,4), etc., (3,1) not listed, so free.\n\nBut I'm planning to eat (5,3) first perhaps, since it's closer.\n\nLet's list the actions starting from turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: must move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 6: I need to choose.\n\nSuppose I go to (5,4) on turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4)\n\nNo food, snake: head (5,4), body (4,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 7: from (5,4), move D to (5,3) to eat food.\n\n(5,3) has food, so eat, snake grows to three: head (5,3), body (5,4), and (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, at (5,3), as before, can move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3)\n\n(4,3) is empty, no food.\n\n(6,3) empty.\n\nNow, if I move L to (4,3) on turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (4,3)\n\nNo food, snake moves: head to (4,3), tail removed, so tail was (4,4), removed, new positions: head (4,3), body (5,3)? Previous positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (4,4)\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), no food eaten, so new head (4,3), new body: (5,3), and tail (4,4) removed? Since no growth, the last segment is removed.\n\nSo snake was [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nMove head to (4,3), not food, so new positions: head at (4,3), the first body segment (5,4) becomes the new body after head, but since no growth, the tail (4,4) is removed, so new snake: [(4,3), (5,3)]? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (5,3), index 1: body (5,4), index 2: tail (4,4)\n\nAfter move to new cell C=(4,3), not food.\n\nNew head at C, new body at old head position (5,3), and the old tail (4,4) is removed. So new positions: [ (4,3), (5,3) ]\n\nOnly two segments now? But I just grew to three.\n\nWhen I eat food, I grow, so the tail doesn't move, length increases.\n\nBut when not eating, tail moves, length same.\n\nHere, at turn 7, after eating, snake has three segments.\n\nTurn 8: move to (4,3), not food, so head moves to (4,3), body moves: the segment at (5,3) becomes the new body? Standard: the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions: let S0 = head, S1, S2 = tail.\n\nAfter move to C, if not food, new S0 = C, new S1 = old S0, new S2 = old S1, and old S2 is removed. But if only three segments, after move, new head at C, new body at old head, and new tail at old body, old tail removed.\n\nSo here: old: S0=(5,3), S1=(5,4), S2=(4,4)\n\nMove to C=(4,3), not food.\n\nNew: S0 = (4,3), S1 = old S0 = (5,3), and S2 = old S1 = (5,4)? No.\n\nS1 is the segment that was S0, so new S1 = (5,3)\n\nThen new tail should be old S1, which is (5,4)\n\nBut old S2 is (4,4), removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]? That can't be, because (5,4) is now tail, but (5,3) is body.\n\nVisually: from (5,3) head, (5,4), (4,4) tail.\n\nMove head to (4,3), which is left of head.\n\nThen the body (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,3)? No.\n\nThe segment S1 at (5,4) moves to the previous position of S0, which is (5,3).\n\nS2 at (4,4) moves to previous position of S1, which is (5,4).\n\nThen new head at (4,3).\n\nSo new positions: head (4,3), then body at (5,3) (which was old head), then tail at (5,4) (which was old body position, but moved to (5,4)).\n\nOld S1 was at (5,4), moves to old S0 position (5,3).\n\nOld S2 at (4,4) moves to old S1 position (5,4).\n\nNew head at (4,3).\n\nSo new snake: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nBut (5,3) and (5,4) are adjacent, but (4,3) is left.\n\nThen the tail is at (5,4).\n\nNow, direction: moved Left, so direction L.\n\nBut at turn 8, snake at [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nHead at (4,3), direction Left.\n\nNow, possible moves: from (4,3), can move L to (3,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2), not R to (5,3) because (5,3) is body, not tail, collision.\n\n(5,3) is body segment, so moving to (5,3) would be collision.\n\nU to (4,4): (4,4) is not occupied? In new positions, (4,4) is not in snake, so empty.\n\nD to (4,2): empty.\n\nL to (3,3): empty.\n\nSo can go U, D, L.\n\nNot R.\n\nNow, to reach (4,1), I can go D to (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\n(4,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to turn 6 decision.\n\nAt turn 6, from (4,4), if I go Down to (4,3) instead.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)\n\nNo food, snake: head (4,3), body (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,3), can move L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2)\n\n(5,3) has food, so I can move R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen eat, grow to three: head (5,3), body (4,3), and (4,4) since tail not removed.\n\nNew positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen same as before, at (5,3), can move L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision, or R to (6,3), or U to (5,4), or D to (5,2) wall.\n\nU to (5,4): (5,4) empty, can move.\n\nR to (6,3): empty.\n\nSo can go U or R.\n\nIf go U to (5,4), then at (5,4), etc.\n\nBut I want to eat (4,1) eventually.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), from (4,3) I could have gone down earlier.\n\nAt turn 7, from (4,3), I could move D to (4,2) instead of R to (5,3).\n\nThen at turn 7: move D to (4,2)\n\nNo food, snake: head (4,2), body (4,3) (since tail (4,4) removed? Old snake: [(4,3), (4,4)] after turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: moved to (4,3), no food, so new snake: [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move to (4,2), not food, so new head (4,2), new body (4,3), tail (4,4) removed, so [(4,2), (4,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 8: move D to (4,1) to eat food.\n\n(4,1) has food, so eat, grow to three: head (4,1), body (4,2), and (4,3)\n\nNew positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, at (4,1), head, can move U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision, or L to (3,1), or R to (5,1) but (5,1) wall, so only L to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) not wall, empty.\n\nSo move L to (3,1).\n\nThen snake grows, but after eating, length 3, then move to (3,1), no food, so new positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2) removed? After move, not food, so tail removed.\n\nOld: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nMove head to (3,1), not food, so new head (3,1), new body (4,1), new tail (4,2), and (4,3) removed.\n\nSo [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut this seems feasible.\n\nHowever, in this path, I ate (4,1) at turn 8.\n\nIf I ate (5,3) at turn 7, I could eat it sooner.\n\n(5,3) has shorter life, life span 5, so it disappears sooner if not eaten.\n\nAt turn 5, (5,3) life 5, so it will be gone after turn 9, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) life 6, gone after turn 10.\n\n(2,5) life 9, gone after turn 13.\n\n(1,1) life 5, gone after turn 9.\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), which might be hard to reach with walls.\n\nFor example, (1,2) is wall, so (1,1) can only be accessed from (1,0) but y=0 is border wall, or from (0,1) x=0 wall, or (2,1) or (1,2) but (1,2) wall, so (1,1) is surrounded? Let's see.\n\n(1,1): adjacent cells: (1,0) y=0 wall, (1,2) internal wall, (0,1) x=0 wall, (2,1) not wall.\n\n(2,1) is free, I think.\n\nSo (1,1) can be accessed from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, to eat it, head must move to (1,1) when it is free.\n\nBut currently, it's far from me.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) at (2,5), adjacent: (2,4) is wall, (2,6) y=6, not border, (1,5), (3,5) but (3,5) wall, so can be accessed from (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5) wall, so from (1,5) or (2,6).\n\n(2,6) y=6, not border.\n\nBut again, far.\n\nFor now, I should focus on nearby food.\n\nAt turn 6, moving to (4,3) or (5,4) both allow me to eat (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nMoving to (4,3) also allows me to go down to (4,1) later.\n\nBut eating (5,3) gives me growth now.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating sooner is better for score and length.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (4,1): from (4,1), I can only go to (3,1) or (4,2), as (5,1) wall and (4,0) wall.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,1), I can go to (3,2), (2,1), (4,1), etc.\n\n(3,2) not wall.\n\nBut there is wall at (1,2), (2,4), etc.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not relevant now.\n\nFor turn 5, action is fixed: R to (4,4)\n\nFor turn 6, I need to choose.\n\nLet's plan for 5 turns ahead: turns 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: let's say I move D to (4,3) to get closer to (4,1) and also (5,3)\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) to eat (5,3)\n\nThen after eating, at (5,3) with body (4,3) and (4,4)\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), then at (5,4), no food, snake: head (5,4), body (5,3), tail (4,3) removed? After move to (5,4), not food, so new positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), tail (4,4) removed, so [(5,4), (5,3)] since (4,4) removed.\n\nOld: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (5,4), not food, so new head (5,4), new body (5,3), new tail (4,3), and (4,4) removed. So [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nOnly two segments.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, collision, L to (4,4), R to (6,4) wall.\n\nSo can go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) empty.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut I lost the growth; the snake is short again.\n\nAfter eating at turn 7, snake length 3.\n\nAt turn 8, if I move to a cell with no food, the tail is removed, so length decreases to 2.\n\nTo maintain length, I need to eat food regularly.\n\nIn this case, after eating (5,3) at turn 7, at turn 8 I should move to a cell that has food, but the only other food is (4,1) or (2,5), not adjacent.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), from (5,3), I can go to (4,3) but it's body, or to (6,3), or (5,4).\n\nNone has food.\n\nSo I will lose length if I don't eat soon.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to eat (4,1) first, which is below, so that after eating, I can go to other areas.\n\nLet's try to eat (4,1) directly.\n\nFrom turn 5: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,2)  (not to (5,3))\n\nAt turn 7: from (4,3), move D to (4,2)\n\nNo food, snake: after turn 6, at [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (4,2), not food, so new head (4,2), new body (4,3), tail (4,4) removed, so [(4,2), (4,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,1) to eat food.\n\nEat, grow to three: head (4,1), body (4,2), and (4,3)\n\nNew positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, at (4,1), can move only L to (3,1) (since U to (4,2) body, R to (5,1) wall, D to (4,0) wall)\n\nSo move L to (3,1) on turn 9.\n\n(3,1) no food, so new head (3,1), new body (4,1), new tail (4,2), and (4,3) removed. So [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 10: from (3,1), can move L to (2,1), U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, R to (4,1) body.\n\nSo can go L to (2,1) or U to (3,2)\n\n(2,1) not wall, (3,2) not wall.\n\nThen I can go towards (2,5) or other food.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), I can reach later.\n\nNow, in this case, I ate (4,1) at turn 8, and have length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten (5,3) at turn 7, at turn 8 I would have to move to a safe cell, but lose length.\n\nSo for long-term, eating (4,1) might be better because after eating, I can move left to (3,1) and explore, whereas after eating (5,3), I might be near walls.\n\nMoreover, (4,1) has longer life, but both are available.\n\nAnother option at turn 6: move to (4,5) Up.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to (2,5) food.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), from (4,5) to (3,5) but (3,5) is wall, or to (4,6), or (5,5), or (4,4) but occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), turn 6 move U to (4,5)\n\nNo food, snake: head (4,5), body (4,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,5), can move U to (4,6), L to (3,5) but (3,5) wall, R to (5,5), D to (4,4) body.\n\nSo can go U to (4,6) or R to (5,5)\n\n(4,6) not wall, (5,5) not wall.\n\nSuppose go R to (5,5)\n\nThen at (5,5), no food, snake: head (5,5), body (4,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5), can move U to (5,6) but (5,6) is wall, D to (5,4), L to (4,5) body, R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) not wall? x=6,y=5, not border, walls: (6,4) wall, so (6,5) free.\n\nD to (5,4) free.\n\nSo can go D to (5,4) or R to (6,5)\n\nBut (5,4) has no food, but I can go down to (5,3) which has food.\n\nFrom (5,5), move D to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nNo food, snake: head (5,4), body (5,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 9: move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nBut (5,3) life span, at turn 5 life 5, so at turn 9, it has 1 turn left? Turn 5:5, t6:4, t7:3, t8:2, t9:1, so at turn 9 it is present, I can eat.\n\nThen eat at turn 9.\n\nBut I delayed eating.\n\nWhereas if I go down directly, I can eat sooner.\n\nFor maximizing score, eating sooner is better, but since all food same value, eating any is fine, but I need to eat multiple.\n\nBut for survival, I should avoid risks.\n\nIn the first approach, going down to eat (4,1) seems safe.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,1), I can go left to (3,1), then to (2,1), etc., towards (1,1) or (2,5).\n\n(1,1) can be eaten if I go to (2,1) then to (1,1).\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is possible, since (1,2) is wall, but (1,1) is accessible from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) from (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output a sequence based on current knowledge.\n\nLet me decide on a plan.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)  // to go towards (4,1) and also can access (5,3)\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) to go to (4,1)\n\nOr move R to (5,3) to eat (5,3)\n\nBut to prioritize (4,1), move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,1) to eat\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (3,1)\n\nNow, for turn 10, etc., but I think for the output, I can do up to turn 9 or 10.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=5.\n\nAlso, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn turn 7, if I move to (4,2), then turn 8 to (4,1), that's fine.\n\nBut at turn 6, if I move to (4,3), turn 7 to (4,2), turn 8 to (4,1), turn 9 to (3,1)\n\nBut turn 9 action is not fixed yet.\n\nSince the food at (5,3) might expire soon, but I can still eat it later if I want, but with walls, it might be harder.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), I can go to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., but (3,3) might be free.\n\nLet's list the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D  // to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: D  // to (4,1) eat\n\nThen turn 9: from (4,1), move L to (3,1)\n\nNow for turn 9, action L.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps up to turn 9.\n\nThen turn 10: from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output turns 5 to 9.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions might be sufficient.\n\nTurn 5,6,7,8,9: that's 5 turns.\n\nActions: turn 5: R, turn 6: D, turn 7: D, turn 8: D, turn 9: L\n\nBut at turn 8, moving D to (4,1) from (4,2), which is down.\n\nAt turn 9, from (4,1) to (3,1) is left.\n\nNow, is there any risk?\n\nAt turn 7, when I move to (4,2), is (4,2) safe? Yes.\n\nAlso, at turn 8, (4,1) has food, I eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 8, (4,1) life span was 6 at turn 5, so at turn 8, remaining life 3, present.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is still there, but I don't eat it.\n\nBut that's fine.\n\nTo eat (5,3), I could have a different plan.\n\nBut with the walls, going to (5,3) might lead to a tighter spot.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go to (6,3), then to (6,2), etc., but (6,2) is free, then to (6,1) but (6,1) wall, so to (7,2) or (5,2) wall, so from (6,2) can go to (6,3) or (7,2) or (6,1) wall, so (7,2) or (6,3), but (7,2) x=7 border? x=7 is border wall, so (7,2) invalid.\n\nx=7 is wall, so from (6,2), can only go to (6,3) or (5,2) wall, or (6,1) wall, or (7,2) wall, so only (6,3) up, but (6,3) is where I came from? If I came from (6,3) to (6,2), I can go back, but with body.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), if head, and body at (6,3), then I can only go to (6,3) but body, collision, or other directions blocked, so dead end.\n\n(6,2) can go to (6,3) or to (5,2) wall, (6,1) wall, (7,2) wall, so only possible move is to (6,3), but if (6,3) is body, I die.\n\nSo (6,2) is a dead end if approached from above.\n\nSimilarly, the area near x=6,y=2 is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, it's better to avoid that area.\n\nWhereas the left side is more open.\n\nSo going down to eat (4,1) and then left seems safer.\n\nThus, I'll go with that plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: R (right)\n\nTurn 6: D (down)\n\nTurn 7: D (down) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: D (down) to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 9: L (left) to (3,1)\n\nFor turn 9, from (4,1) after eating, head at (4,1), body at (4,2), tail at (4,3)? After eating at turn 8, snake at [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nThen turn 9 move L to (3,1), not food, so new head (3,1), new body (4,1), new tail (4,2), and (4,3) removed. So snake now [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen it can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut for output, up to turn 9 is fine.\n\nI can add turn 10 if needed, but 5 actions from turn 5 to 9.\n\nTurn 5,6,7,8,9: that's 5 turns.\n\nNow, to write in answer format.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\), the snake must prioritize long-term survival and maximizing score by eating positive food while avoiding collisions. The snake is short (length 2), so growth is important, but risks must be minimized. After evaluating possible moves 5+ turns ahead, the safest and highest-reward plan is to eat the food at (4,1) by moving downward, as it has a longer remaining life span (6 turns at turn 5) and avoids dangerous areas near walls. Moving to (4,1) also allows access to other food like (1,1) or (2,5) later. The food at (5,3) is closer but risks boxing the snake in near walls (e.g., (5,2) and (6,1) are walls), and eating it earlier could lead to length loss if no other food is eaten soon.\n\nAt turn 5, the only valid move is Right (R) to (4,4), as Up and Left are blocked by walls, and Down is an instant reverse. From (4,4), moving Down (D) on turn 6 positions the snake to reach (4,1) efficiently. Continuing Down on turns 7 and 8 eats the food at (4,1) on turn 8, growing the snake to length 3. Then, on turn 9, moving Left (L) to (3,1) avoids body collision and opens paths to other food.\n\nThe planned actions for turns 5 to 9 are:\n\n- Turn 5: Move Right to (4,4) – only valid option, avoids walls and reverse.\n- Turn 6: Move Down to (4,3) – positions for downward path to (4,1).\n- Turn 7: Move Down to (4,2) – continues toward (4,1), safe and no food.\n- Turn 8: Move Down to (4,1) – eats food (+1 score, length increases to 3).\n- Turn 9: Move Left to (3,1) – avoids body collision, explores new area for future food.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one food unit by turn 8, grows, and moves to a safer area for future turns. Beyond turn 9, the snake can target (1,1) or (2,5) with the longer life span.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: R (right)\nTurn 6: D (down)\nTurn 7: D (down)\nTurn 8: D (down)\nTurn 9: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is probably from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacles are given: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). So these are also blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), body at (3,4). Since it's a list with head first, so head is (4,4), and only one body segment at (3,4). So the snake is length 2.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right. So it was moving right to get to (4,4) from (3,4). Previous move was from (3,4) to (4,4) with direction R.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 5\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 8\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (1,1), life span 4 at turn 6, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning on turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, life span N means it will be there for N turns, disappearing after N turns.\n\nThe description says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf at turn t, life span is L, then:\n\n- At turn t, countdown L\n\n- Turn t+1, countdown L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + L - 1, countdown 1\n\n- Turn t + L, countdown 0, disappears? But after N turns, it disappears, so if life span N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N.\n\nThe description: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n\nSo at turn t, with life span N, it will disappear at turn t + N.\n\nFor example, (1,1) at turn 6 with life span 4, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) at turn 6, life span 4, disappears at turn 10.\n\n(4,1) at turn 6, life span 5, disappears at turn 11.\n\n(2,5) at turn 6, life span 8, disappears at turn 14.\n\nNow, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 11 or more.\n\nCurrent turn is 6, so I need to decide actions for turn 6, 7, 8, etc., but the answer format is to output actions for multiple turns starting from turn 6.\n\nThe answer should be like:\n\nTurn 6: action\n\nTurn 7: action\n\n...\n\nBut how many turns? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 moves ahead, but output the sequence for as long as I can, I think. But probably, for the answer, I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from turn 6.\n\nThe format says: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" and so on, without specifying how many. But since it's a game, I might need to output until I eat food or something, but I think for this, I should output a sequence for several turns, say 5 turns or more.\n\nBut let's first assess the current situation.\n\nGrid: 6x6 playable area, from (1,1) to (6,6), with obstacles.\n\nObstacles: internal ones: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSnake: head at (4,4), body at (3,4). So the tail is at (3,4).\n\nHead direction is R, so it just moved right to (4,4).\n\nPossible moves from (4,4): since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be opposite direction? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on this turn, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nPossible moves from (4,4):\n\n- U: (4,5)\n\n- D: (4,3)\n\n- R: (5,4)\n\n- L: (4,3)? L is left, to (3,4), but (3,4) is the body segment.\n\n(3,4) is the current tail. According to rules, I can move to the tail cell because when I move, the tail will also move, so it should be safe, as long as I don't collide with other body parts.\n\nCollision: body collision except that moving into the tail is ok because tail moves.\n\n\"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,5)\n\n- D to (4,3)\n\n- R to (5,4)\n\n- L to (3,4) which is the tail, so it should be ok, since tail will move away.\n\nBut current direction is R, and L is opposite, so I cannot move L because of no instant reverse.\n\n\"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nSo for turn 6, since head direction is R, I cannot move L (left). So only possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check if these cells are free.\n\nFirst, (4,5): is it wall or obstacle?\n\nWalls: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,5) is within 1-6 in both, so not wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). (4,5) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3): not wall, not in obstacles, so free.\n\n(5,4): not wall, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) not listed, so free? Obstacles are (6,4), etc., (5,4) is not in the list, so should be free.\n\nBut (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, obstacles are (6,4), which is different cell.\n\n(6,4) is blocked, (5,4) should be free.\n\nNow, food locations: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5)\n\n(4,1) is food, but let's see positions.\n\nI need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nSince snake is short, only length 2, eating food will increase length.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,4), head at (4,4), so head is adjacent to tail? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,4) and (3,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the tail cell (3,4) does not have food on it. Food is elsewhere, so no issue now.\n\nFirst, for turn 6, possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nI need to evaluate which one is best for long-term survival and scoring.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid rows and columns: let's say x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) playable except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSnake: head (4,4), body (3,4)\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5)\n\nAll food value +1.\n\nLife spans: (1,1) gone at turn 10, (5,3) gone at turn 10, (4,1) gone at turn 11, (2,5) gone at turn 14.\n\nCurrent turn 6.\n\nNow, distances to food.\n\nTo (5,3): from head (4,4), (5,3) is down-right? (4,4) to (5,3) is Δx=1, Δy=-1, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells are (4,5), (4,3), (5,4), (3,4).\n\n(5,3) is one step right and one down, so not directly adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is below, at (4,1), from (4,4), that's down 3 steps.\n\n(2,5) is left and up, etc.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, I should consider paths to food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nThe grid has many obstacles, so I need to find safe paths.\n\nList all free cells.\n\nPlayable area: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n(5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (6,4), (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,6)\n\nNow, snake occupies (4,4) and (3,4), but when I move, the snake will shift.\n\nFor turn 6, after move, the new head will be at the new position, and tail will move from (3,4) to... depending on the move.\n\nLet's simulate possible moves for turn 6.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,5)\n\nThen new head: (4,5), body was (3,4), but since snake moves, the body segment was at (3,4), and head moves to (4,5), so new body is the previous head, which is (4,4). So new snake positions: [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nTail was (3,4), but since we moved, tail is removed or shifted? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, the tail is removed if no food eaten, but if food eaten, tail stays and new segment added.\n\nBut for now, no food eaten, so after move, head to new position, and tail is removed, so snake becomes shorter? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail moves one step, so snake length same.\n\nPositions: from [head, body, ..., tail]\n\nAfter moving head to new position, the tail is removed, so new positions: [new head, old head, ... , second last body segment]\n\nIn this case, snake is only two segments: head and tail.\n\nSo after moving head to new position, the tail (3,4) is removed, and the new tail is the old head, which was (4,4), but now it's the body.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nCurrent positions: [ (4,4), (3,4) ] with (4,4) head, (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter move, say to (4,5):\n\nNew head position: (4,5)\n\nThen the body becomes the previous head position, so new positions: [ (4,5), (4,4) ]\n\nAnd the old tail (3,4) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (4,3): new head (4,3), new positions [ (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nIf move to (5,4): new head (5,4), new positions [ (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nIn all cases, the tail is removed, so the cell (3,4) becomes free.\n\nNow for turn 6 actions.\n\nPossible: U, D, R.\n\nFirst, move U to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is free? Yes, as above.\n\nAfter move, snake at [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nFood: (4,5) has no food, so no eat.\n\nLife spans: all food still there, but countdown decreases.\n\nTurn 7, from (4,5), head direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, but not D (reverse).\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, and head direction U, D is opposite, so cannot move D.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\nBut (3,5) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle (3,5), so cannot move there.\n\n(5,5) should be free, not obstacle.\n\n(4,6): y=6, but walls are y=7 and y=0, so y=6 is not wall, since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\nx=4,y=6, not border, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free.\n\nSo from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), R to (5,5), L to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, so not possible. So only U and R.\n\nNow, similarly for other initial moves.\n\nBut I need to think longer term.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the nearest food.\n\nNearest food: (5,3) is at (5,3), from (4,4), distance Manhattan |5-4| + |3-4| =1+1=2\n\n(4,1) at (4,1), |4-4| + |1-4| =0+3=3\n\n(1,1) |1-4| + |1-4| =3+3=6\n\n(2,5) |2-4| + |5-4| =2+1=3\n\nSo (5,3) is closest, at distance 2.\n\n(2,5) also distance 3, but in different direction.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is below and right of (4,4).\n\nTo reach (5,3), I need to go to (5,4) or (4,3) or directly, but not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving D to (4,3) gets me closer to (5,3)? (4,3) to (5,3) is adjacent right.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (5,4) then D to (5,3), but (5,4) to (5,3) is down.\n\nBut (5,3) has food, so if I go to (5,3), I eat it.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, for turn 6, if I move D to (4,3).\n\nThen new head (4,3), new snake [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nHead direction now D.\n\n(4,3) has no food, so no eat.\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,3), head direction D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) has food! And it's adjacent.\n\nSo if I move R to (5,3), I can eat it.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nFirst, move to (5,3) from (4,3).\n\n(4,3) to (5,3) is right, so head direction would be R.\n\nNow, when I eat food, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nCurrent snake before eating: positions [(4,3), (4,4)] with head (4,3)\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), new head (5,3), which has food, so I eat it, value +1, length increases.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,3), and since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so body is (4,3), and new segment, so snake becomes [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: snake at [ (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nMove head to (5,3), which has food.\n\nSo new head: (5,3)\n\nBecause food eaten, the tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position. Standard snake growth: when food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new head is added, and the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: previous positions were [head, body, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move to food: new head at food cell, and the tail remains, so the new positions are [new head, old head, old body, ..., old tail]\n\nIn this case, before move: [ (4,3), (4,4) ]  (head at (4,3), tail at (4,4))\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3) and eating food: new head (5,3), then the body is the previous head (4,3), and tail remains (4,4), so new positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Head at (5,3), body at (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nNow, (5,3) is adjacent to (4,3), which is the neck, but that's fine.\n\nNow, what about the area.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nIn this path, I can eat (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3), eat food.\n\nThen snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nHead at (5,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nNow, life span of (5,3) was 4 at turn 6, so at turn 7, it should be eaten, but when eaten, it's consumed, so gone.\n\nLife span countdown: at turn 6, life span 4, so turn 6: countdown 4, turn 7: countdown 3, etc., but when eaten, it disappears immediately, I assume.\n\nThe food is there until eaten or expired.\n\nSo if eaten on turn 7, it's gone.\n\nNow, other foods.\n\nBut after eating, I need to survive.\n\nNow, from (5,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but head direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nAlso, check collisions.\n\nU to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3)\n\n(5,4): is it free? (5,4) not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), etc., (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (5,4) might be occupied? Snake body: positions (4,3) and (4,4), so (5,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2): (5,2) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle (5,2), so cannot move there.\n\n(6,3): not wall, not obstacle, but (6,3) is free? Obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nx=6,y=3.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), so (6,3) is free.\n\nAlso, (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), R to (6,3), L to (4,3) but (4,3) is the body segment, and head direction R, L is opposite, so cannot move L.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf U to (5,4), then new head (5,4), snake becomes [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]? After eating, positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nMove U to (5,4): new head (5,4), no food there, so tail removed? Since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nPrevious tail is (4,4), so it is removed, new positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]? Let's see:\n\nBefore move: [head: (5,3), body: (4,3), tail: (4,4)]\n\nMove head to (5,4), no food, so new head (5,4), body becomes previous body segments: (5,3) and (4,3), and tail (4,4) is removed? Standard: the last segment is removed.\n\nPositions: from [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove head to new position D, no food, then new positions: [D, A, B] and C is removed.\n\nHere: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] A=(5,3), B=(4,3), C=(4,4)\n\nMove to (5,4): new head (5,4), then [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) removed.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (6,3): new head (6,3), [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) removed.\n\nNow back to turn 6 options.\n\nIf I go to (4,3) on turn 6, then (5,3) on turn 7, I eat.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nFor example, if I move R on turn 6 to (5,4).\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4)\n\nNew head (5,4), snake [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNo food at (5,4), so tail (3,4) removed.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 7, from (5,4), head direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (6,4), so cannot move R.\n\nD to (5,3): (5,3) has food, so if I move D, I can eat it.\n\nU to (5,5): free, I think.\n\n(5,5) not obstacle.\n\nSo possible: U or D.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), I eat food.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut on turn 6 I moved to (5,4), then turn 7 to (5,3).\n\nCompared to moving to (4,3) on turn 6 then (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nIn both cases, I eat (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nBut from different positions.\n\nIf I move directly to (5,4) on turn 6, then to (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nOr move to (4,3) on turn 6, then to (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nThe difference is the snake position before eating.\n\nFirst case: turn 6 move R to (5,4), snake [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nThen turn 7 move D to (5,3), eat food, new snake: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] because food eaten, tail not removed.\n\nBefore move: [ (5,4), (4,4) ] head (5,4), tail (4,4)\n\nMove to (5,3), which has food, so new head (5,3), body: previous head (5,4), and tail remains (4,4), so [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nSecond case: turn 6 move D to (4,3), snake [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 7 move R to (5,3), eat, new snake [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nSo in both cases, after eating, snake has three segments, but positions different.\n\nIn first: head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4)\n\nIn second: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNow, from (5,3), as before, possible moves U or R, since D is blocked by obstacle (5,2), and L is reverse or body? Head direction: after moving to (5,3), direction is down in first case? Let's see directions.\n\nIn first sequence: after turn 7 move D to (5,3), head direction now D.\n\nIn second sequence: after turn 7 move R to (5,3), head direction R.\n\nSo different directions.\n\nBut in both cases, from (5,3), moving U or R are options.\n\nNow, another option for turn 6: move U to (4,5)\n\nThen as before, snake [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,5), head U, cannot D.\n\nPossible U to (4,6) or R to (5,5), since L to (3,5) obstacle.\n\n(4,6) or (5,5).\n\nIf U to (4,6), then snake [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nOr R to (5,5), snake [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nNo food eaten yet.\n\n(5,3) is still there, but farther.\n\nI need to consider the whole board and other foods.\n\nThere is food at (4,1), which is below.\n\nAnd (2,5) up-left.\n\nAlso, (1,1) corner.\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), which has obstacle nearby.\n\n(5,1) and (5,2) are obstacles, so (4,1) might be tricky to reach.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) at (2,5), with (2,4) obstacle, and (3,5) obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, (3,5) obstacle, so (2,5) is surrounded? (2,5) neighbors: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5)\n\n(2,4) obstacle, (3,5) obstacle, (1,5) might be free, (2,6) free.\n\nBut (1,5) x=1,y=5, not wall? Walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, y=5, playable.\n\nSo (2,5) has accessible neighbors.\n\nBut let's think about long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has many obstacles, so I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left has obstacles: (1,2), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), etc.\n\nTop-right might be better.\n\nBut let's list all free cells to see possible paths.\n\nFree cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 except obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nAnd snake occupies (3,4) and (4,4), but after move, (3,4) free.\n\nSo available cells.\n\nNow, back to turn 6.\n\nIf I move to (4,3) or (5,4), I can reach (5,3) quickly.\n\nBut after eating (5,3), I am at (5,3) with snake of length 3.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to other food.\n\nFor example, (4,1) or (2,5).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is below.\n\nFrom (5,3), to (4,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles at (5,2), (5,1), so I cannot go directly down from (5,3) because (5,2) is obstacle.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can only go U or R.\n\nU to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf I go U to (5,4), then I am at (5,4), which has no food, snake positions depend on previous.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (6,3), at (6,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut (4,1) is below, but to reach it, I need to go around, since (5,2) blocked.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) go U to (5,4), then left to (4,4), but (4,4) might be body or free.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), if I was at [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] for example, so (4,4) is tail.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), then new head (5,4), no food, so tail removed, new positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) removed.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4), but (4,4) is now free, since tail removed.\n\n(4,4) was tail, but removed, so free.\n\nMove L to (4,4), which is left, but head direction at (5,4) is U? After moving to (5,4) from (5,3), if I moved U, head direction U.\n\nThen from (5,4), head U, possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, and D is reverse, so cannot, L to (4,4), R to (6,4) obstacle.\n\nSo can move U or L.\n\nL to (4,4) is possible.\n\nThen to (4,4), no food, etc.\n\nBut I am getting distracted.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the food at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), life span 5, gone at turn 11.\n\nFrom current position (4,4), I can go down directly: move D to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then D to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,2) and (4,1) need to be free.\n\n(4,2): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2), but (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(4,1) food.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,1) and (5,2), so (4,1) is accessible from above.\n\nSo from (4,4), move D to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then D to (4,1) on turn 8.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,2)  (head direction D, so can move D)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,1), eat food.\n\nLife span of (4,1) is 5 at turn 6, so at turn 8, countdown 3, still there, so can eat.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut after eating (4,1), I am at (4,1), which might be a corner, with obstacles nearby.\n\nFor example, (5,1) obstacle, (5,2) obstacle, so from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), L to (3,1), R to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, so only U or L.\n\nL to (3,1), which might be free.\n\nBut long-term, it might be risky.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (5,3) first, I can eat it on turn 7.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go to (6,3) or (5,4), then to other areas.\n\nThere is food at (2,5), which is far, life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently not an issue, but after eating, the tail might have food, but food is not on tail, it's on separate cells.\n\nThe danger is only if the tail cell has food and head is adjacent, but food is not on snake cells, I assume.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but in this state, no food under snake.\n\nAt turn 6, snake on (4,4) and (3,4), food at (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5), none on (4,4) or (3,4), so no issue.\n\nSo for turn 6, I have three choices: U, D, R.\n\nIf I move U, to (4,5), then I am going up, away from most food except (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), from (4,5), I can go left.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4) and (3,5), so (2,5) might be reachable via (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nBut it's a bit far.\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), then I can go to (5,3) or up.\n\nBut (5,4) is close to (5,3).\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), close to (5,3) and (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is also below.\n\nI need to prioritize long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has a cluster of obstacles on the left and bottom.\n\nFor example, cells around (5,1)-(5,2) blocked, (6,1) blocked, (1,2) blocked, (2,4) blocked, (3,5) blocked, (5,6) blocked, (6,4) blocked.\n\nSo the free areas are: top-left: (1,1) but (1,2) blocked, so (1,1) has only (1,2) neighbor blocked, so can go to (2,1) or (1,3) etc.\n\nBut let's not list all.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to go for the nearest food and then move to open areas.\n\nSince I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate a sequence.\n\nLet's assume I go for (5,3) first.\n\nOption A: turn 6 move D to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 7 move R to (5,3) eat food, snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] head direction R.\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,3), head R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nSay I move R to (6,3) to avoid the bottom which has obstacles.\n\nMove R to (6,3), no food, so new positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) removed.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 9, from (6,3), head R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible U to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, so cannot.\n\nU to (6,4) obstacle, D to (6,2), R to (7,3) invalid, L to (5,3) but body and reverse.\n\nSo only possible D to (6,2)\n\n(6,2) is free? Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,1), (6,4), but (6,2) not listed, so free.\n\nMove D to (6,2), no food, new positions [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] and (4,3) removed.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 10, from (6,2), head D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible D to (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, L to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, R to (7,2) wall, so no move? Dead end!\n\nOh, problem. At (6,2), with head D, I can only move D, L, or R, but D to (6,1) obstacle, L to (5,2) obstacle, R to (7,2) wall, so no valid move. Snake dies.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nIf on turn 8 from (5,3) I moved U to (5,4) instead.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), snake at [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] head direction R (since moved right to eat).\n\nTurn 8 move U to (5,4), no food, new positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) removed.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,4), head U, cannot move D.\n\nPossible U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) obstacle.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSay move U to (5,5), no food, new positions [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ] and (4,3) removed.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen turn 10, from (5,5), head U, cannot D.\n\nPossible U to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) should be free, not obstacle.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nSo can move L or R.\n\nIf L to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot go up.\n\nBut I can go left or right.\n\nFrom (5,5), move to (4,5) or (6,5).\n\nThen to other areas.\n\nBut there is food at (2,5), which is at (2,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go left to (4,5), then to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, so need to go down or up.\n\n(3,5) blocked, so to reach (2,5), I need to go via (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nFor example, from (5,5) to (4,5), then to (4,6) or (3,5) blocked, so to (4,6), then to (3,6), but (3,6) free? Then to (2,6), then to (2,5).\n\nBut it's a long way.\n\nSince I have food at (2,5) with long life span, I can go there later.\n\nBut back to the point, in the sequence where I went to (6,3), I got stuck at (6,2).\n\nSo that path is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, from (5,3), it's better to move U to (5,4) rather than R to (6,3), because (6,3) leads to a dead end.\n\nNow, what about moving R on turn 6 to (5,4).\n\nTurn 6 move R to (5,4), snake [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nTurn 7, from (5,4), head R, cannot L.\n\nPossible U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4) obstacle.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf D to (5,3), eat food, snake [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ] head direction D.\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,3), head D, cannot U.\n\nPossible U not, D to (5,2) obstacle, L to (4,3), R to (6,3)\n\nL to (4,3) is left, but head direction D, so L is not opposite? Opposite would be U, since D is down, opposite is up.\n\nDirections: U up, D down, L left, R right.\n\nSo for head direction D, opposite is U, so I can move L or R or D.\n\nBut D to (5,2) obstacle, so move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter eating, positions [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ], so (4,3) is free.\n\nMove L to (4,3), no food, new positions [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] and (4,4) removed.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen turn 9, from (4,3), head L, cannot R.\n\nPossible U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3)\n\n(4,4) is free now, (4,2) free, (3,3) free? Not obstacle.\n\nEtc.\n\nI can go to (4,2) then to (4,1) for food.\n\n(4,1) is food.\n\nFrom (4,3), move D to (4,2), no food, then to (4,1) eat.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach it.\n\nTurn 9 from (4,3) move D to (4,2), head direction D.\n\nThen turn 10 move D to (4,1), eat food.\n\nLife span (4,1) at turn 6 is 5, so turn 10 is t+4? Turn 6: life 5, turn 7:4, turn 8:3, turn 9:2, turn 10:1, so on turn 10 it is still there, can eat.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut after eating (4,1), at (4,1), with possible moves U or L, as before.\n\nNow, U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nThen I can go left to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut it might be a bit confined.\n\nAnother option: move U on turn 6 to (4,5).\n\nThen snake [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 7, from (4,5), head U, cannot D.\n\nPossible U to (4,6) or R to (5,5), L to (3,5) obstacle.\n\nSay move U to (4,6), no food, snake [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 8, from (4,6), head U, cannot D.\n\nPossible U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, so invalid, L to (3,6), R to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so only L to (3,6)\n\n(3,6) free, move to (3,6), snake [(3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead direction L (since left from (4,6)).\n\nTurn 9, from (3,6), head L, cannot R.\n\nPossible U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5) obstacle, L to (2,6), so only L to (2,6)\n\nMove to (2,6), no food, snake [(2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 10, from (2,6), head L, cannot R.\n\nPossible U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6)\n\n(2,5) has food! And (1,6) free.\n\nSo I can move D to (2,5) and eat food.\n\n(2,5) is food with value 1.\n\nLife span at turn 6 is 8, turn 10 is fine.\n\nSo eat (2,5) on turn 10.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nNew positions: before move, snake [(2,6), (3,6)]\n\nMove to (2,5), eat, so new head (2,5), body (2,6), tail (3,6)? Previous tail was (3,6), so new positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6) but body, and U is reverse? Head direction D, opposite U, so cannot move U.\n\nD to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, L to (1,5), R to (3,5) obstacle.\n\nSo only possible L to (1,5)\n\nMove to (1,5), no food, etc.\n\nBut I am in the top-left.\n\nThere is food at (1,1), which I can go down to.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,5) to (1,4), (1,3), then to (1,1), but (1,1) to (1,2) blocked, so I can go to (2,1) or something.\n\nNot dead end immediately.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ate (2,5) on turn 10.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n- If I go down to eat (5,3) and then (4,1), I might eat two foods quickly but risk in bottom area.\n\n- If I go up to eat (2,5), I eat later but in a different area.\n\n- Also, (1,1) is there, but hard to reach with obstacles.\n\nFor long-term survival, the top row might be more open except for obstacles.\n\nList the obstacles again: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSo top row y=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) obstacle, (6,6) but (6,6) not obstacle, but (6,4) obstacle, etc.\n\n(5,6) obstacle, so y=6 has (1,6) to (4,6) and (6,6) free, (5,6) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, bottom y=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) food, (5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle, so (1,1) to (4,1) free except (1,2) blocked but (1,2) is at y=2.\n\nx=1: (1,1), (1,2) obstacle, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\netc.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat food when possible, but prioritize survival.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating any is good.\n\nBut with the life span, (1,1) disappears at turn 10, (5,3) at turn 10, (4,1) at turn 11, (2,5) at turn 14.\n\nSo (1,1) and (5,3) will disappear soon if not eaten.\n\nTurn 10 they disappear.\n\nCurrent turn 6, so I have until turn 9 to eat them, since on turn 10 they are gone.\n\nLife span at turn t, disappears at turn t + N.\n\nFor (1,1): turn 6, life 4, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3): turn 6 life 4, disappear turn 10.\n\n(4,1): turn 6 life 5, disappear turn 11.\n\n(2,5): turn 6 life 8, disappear turn 14.\n\nSo (1,1) and (5,3) must be eaten by turn 9 to get the point.\n\nTurn 9 is the last chance to eat them.\n\nNow, can I reach (1,1) from current position?\n\nFrom (4,4) to (1,1): need to go left and down.\n\nBut obstacles: (1,2) blocked, so from (1,1), neighbors are (1,2) blocked, (2,1), (1,0) wall, so only (2,1) is accessible.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) to (1,1), (3,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nBut from current (4,4), to (1,1), Manhattan distance 6, but with obstacles, it might be longer.\n\nFor example, shortest path: (4,4) to (3,4) but (3,4) is tail, but after move, free, but I cannot move L on turn 6.\n\nTurn 6, can only U,D,R.\n\nSuppose turn 6 move L not possible, so to go left, I need to go up or down first.\n\nSay turn 6 move U to (4,5), then turn 7 move L to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, cannot.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can only U or R as before.\n\nTurn 7 from (4,5) move R to (5,5), for example.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go left to (4,5), but not directly to left.\n\nTo reach (1,1) in few turns: from (4,4), move D to (4,3), then to (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) but (2,2) to (2,1) to (1,1).\n\nBut (2,2) is free? Obstacles not listed, so free.\n\nBut from (4,3) to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut on turn 6, if I move D to (4,3), then turn 7 I can go to (5,3) to eat, or to (3,3) to go left.\n\nIf I go to (3,3) on turn 7.\n\nTurn 6 move D to (4,3), snake [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 7, from (4,3), head D, cannot U.\n\nPossible D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), no food, snake [(3,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 8, from (3,3), head L, cannot R.\n\nPossible U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3)\n\n(3,4) was tail, now free, so can move U to (3,4), or D to (3,2), or L to (2,3).\n\nTo reach (1,1), say move L to (2,3), snake [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 9, from (2,3), head L, cannot R.\n\nPossible U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\nMove D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nIf move L to (1,3), snake [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nThen turn 10, from (1,3), head L, cannot R.\n\nPossible U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, L to (0,3) wall, so only U to (1,4)\n\nBut (1,1) is not reached, and on turn 10 it disappears.\n\nFrom (2,3) on turn 9, I can move D to (2,2), then turn 10 move D to (2,1), but (2,1) to (1,1) is adjacent, but on turn 10, (1,1) disappears, so I need to eat on turn 9.\n\nBut from (2,3) on turn 9, I can only go to (2,2) or (1,3), not directly to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is not adjacent to (2,3), so I cannot eat it on turn 9.\n\nThe last chance is turn 9, but from any position, it's hard to reach (1,1) by turn 9 from turn 6 with 3 moves? Turn 6,7,8,9: 4 moves.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 9 is 3 moves? Turn t action moves to position at turn t+1.\n\nTurn 6 action: move to new position at start of turn 7.\n\nTurn 7 action: move to position at turn 8, etc.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be on (1,1) or adjacent on turn 8 or something.\n\nTo eat on turn k, I move to the food cell on turn k.\n\nSo to eat (1,1) on turn 9, I need to move to (1,1) on turn 9 action.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3), eat on turn 9.\n\nNow from current, to (1,1): minimum Manhattan distance 6, with obstacles, at least 4 moves needed, but from turn 6 to turn 9, I have 3 moves (turn 6,7,8 actions for positions at 7,8,9), so I can reach on turn 9 only if I start moving directly.\n\nBut with no instant reverse, and obstacles, it's tight.\n\nFor example, turn 6 move D to (4,3)  // down\n\nTurn 7 move L to (3,3)  // left\n\nTurn 8 move L to (2,3)  // left\n\nTurn 9 move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3), not to (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,1) is not possible in one move; I need to go to (2,1) or (1,2), but (1,2) blocked.\n\n(2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1) to (1,1), so at least two moves from (2,3) to (1,1).\n\nBut on turn 9, I am at (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (1,3), not to (1,1).\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,1) by turn 9. Similarly, from other paths.\n\nFor example, if turn 6 move U to (4,5), then it's farther.\n\nSo (1,1) is likely not reachable in time, so I might miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) can be reached by turn 7 or 8 easily.\n\nSo for (5,3), I can eat by turn 7 or 8.\n\n(4,1) can be eaten by turn 8 or 9.\n\n(2,5) has more time.\n\nSo probably, I should go for (5,3) or (4,1).\n\nSince (5,3) is closer, I go for that.\n\nBut earlier, if I go to (5,3), then from there, moving U to (5,4) is safer than R to (6,3).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to other places.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,1) which I can reach later.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4), then D to (4,3), etc., to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) disappears at turn 11, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) at turn 14.\n\nSo for turn 6, I think moving D to (4,3) is good, then to (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nThen on turn 8, move U to (5,4) to avoid the bottom dead end.\n\nThen from there, I can plan to go to (2,5) or (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is below, might be risky with obstacles.\n\n(2,5) is up, more open.\n\nSo perhaps go up after eating (5,3).\n\nLet's outline a sequence.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,3)  // down\n\nThen snake at [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3)  // eat food, snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] head direction R\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,4)  // up, no food, snake at [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]  // (4,4) removed, head direction U\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), head U, possible moves U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) obstacle, so U or L\n\nSay move U to (5,5)  // up, no food, snake at [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] head direction U\n\nTurn 10: from (5,5), head U, cannot D, possible U to (5,6) obstacle, L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nMove L to (4,5) or R to (6,5)\n\nSay move L to (4,5)  // left, no food, snake at [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] head direction L\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), head L, cannot R, possible U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) obstacle\n\nSo U to (4,6) or D to (4,4)\n\nSay move U to (4,6)  // up, no food, etc.\n\nBut there is food at (2,5), I can go towards it.\n\nFrom (4,5) or (5,5), I can move left to (3,5) but blocked, so need to go to (4,6) or (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (2,5).\n\nFor example, on turn 10 at (5,5), instead of L, move R to (6,5), but (6,5) free, head direction U, move R to (6,5), then from there to (6,6), etc., but not towards food.\n\nTo go to (2,5), from (5,5) move L to (4,5) on turn 10, then turn 11 from (4,5) move U to (4,6), turn 12 move L to (3,6), turn 13 move L to (2,6), turn 14 move D to (2,5) eat, but (2,5) disappears at turn 14, so on turn 14, if I move to it, I can eat before it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn 6, life 8, disappears at turn 14, so on turn 14, it is there until the turn it disappears, so I can eat on turn 14.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nSince the current turn is 6, and I need to output from turn 6.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, I can start with moving to (5,3).\n\nTo have a safe path, moving D on turn 6 seems reasonable.\n\nThen turn 7 R to eat.\n\nThen turn 8 U to avoid dead end.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial move, if I move U, I can go to (2,5) later, but (5,3) might expire.\n\n(5,3) can be eaten by turn 9.\n\nWith move U on turn 6, I might not reach (5,3) in time.\n\nFor example, turn 6 move U to (4,5), turn 7 move R to (5,5), turn 8 move D to (5,4), turn 9 move D to (5,3) eat on turn 9.\n\nPossible, but later than moving directly.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (2,5) as in earlier sequence.\n\nBut since (5,3) is closer and can be eaten sooner, I think it's better to eat it.\n\nSo I'll go with turn 6: D to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 7: R to (5,3) eat\n\nThen turn 8: U to (5,4)\n\nThen for turn 9, from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5)\n\nSay move L to (4,4) to go towards center or to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) can be eaten later.\n\nTo show 5 turns ahead, I can output up to turn 10 or 11.\n\nSince head direction changes, I need to specify the action.\n\nAlso, for the answer format.\n\nSo let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn 6: move D\n\nTurn 7: move R\n\nTurn 8: move U\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), head U, possible L or U.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), then turn 10 from (5,5), move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5)\n\nSay move L to (4,5)\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo be consistent, I'll provide 5 moves.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 10: L (to (4,5))\n\nBut on turn 9, if at (5,4), move U to (5,5), head direction U.\n\nThen turn 10, from (5,5), move L to (4,5), head direction L.\n\nThen turn 11, from (4,5), move U to (4,6) or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, this should work.\n\nIf I move to (4,1) after, but not necessary for the sequence.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 6 to 11) while considering the food life spans, obstacles, and movement constraints. The snake is currently at positions [(4,4), (3,4)] with head direction \"R\" (right). The food items and their disappearance turns are:\n- (1,1): Disappears at turn 10 (life span 4, current turn 6).\n- (5,3): Disappears at turn 10 (life span 4, current turn 6).\n- (4,1): Disappears at turn 11 (life span 5, current turn 6).\n- (2,5): Disappears at turn 14 (life span 8, current turn 6).\n\nSince (1,1) is difficult to reach by turn 9 (due to distance and obstacles), and (5,3) is the closest food at Manhattan distance 2, I prioritize eating (5,3) quickly to gain a point and increase snake length. After that, I aim to avoid the risky bottom-right area (near obstacles like (5,2), (6,1), etc.) and move towards safer regions for future food opportunities like (2,5).\n\n#### Key Risks and Decisions:\n- **Turn 6 Options (from (4,4), head direction R)**: Cannot move left (reverse). Possible moves:\n  - **U (to (4,5))**: Moves away from (5,3) and (4,1); may delay eating.\n  - **D (to (4,3))**: Gets closer to (5,3) and (4,1); sets up eating (5,3) on turn 7.\n  - **R (to (5,4))**: Also sets up eating (5,3) on turn 7, but positions snake differently after eating.\n- Choosing **D on turn 6** allows eating (5,3) on turn 7 with minimal risk. After eating, moving up (U) on turn 8 avoids the dead end near (6,2) (as moving right to (6,3) can lead to a trap).\n- **Long-term Survival**: After eating (5,3), move towards the top-left where (2,5) is accessible and less obstructed. The sequence avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\n#### Planned Sequence (Turns 6-11):\n1. **Turn 6 (t=6)**: Move **D (down)** to (4,3).  \n   - Rationale: Positions head at (4,3), closer to (5,3) for eating next turn. Avoids moving right (which could lead to obstacles) or up (which delays eating). Snake becomes [(4,3), (4,4)], head direction D.\n\n2. **Turn 7 (t=7)**: Move **R (right)** to (5,3) to eat the positive food.  \n   - Rationale: Eats (5,3) (+1 point, snake length increases to 3). New snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)], head direction R. (5,3) is consumed before it disappears at turn 10.\n\n3. **Turn 8 (t=8)**: Move **U (up)** to (5,4).  \n   - Rationale: Avoids moving right to (6,3), which could lead to a dead end (e.g., at (6,2)). Moving up keeps options open and heads towards safer areas. No food eaten; snake becomes [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] (tail (4,4) removed), head direction U.\n\n4. **Turn 9 (t=9)**: Move **U (up)** to (5,5).  \n   - Rationale: From (5,4), head direction U, cannot move down (reverse). Moving up to (5,5) avoids left to (4,4) (less progress) and right to (6,4) (obstacle). Positions near center for flexibility. No food; snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)], head direction U.\n\n5. **Turn 10 (t=10)**: Move **L (left)** to (4,5).  \n   - Rationale: From (5,5), head direction U, cannot move down. Moving left to (4,5) starts path towards (2,5) food. (1,1) and (5,3) disappear this turn but are inaccessible/unprofitable now. No food; snake becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], head direction L.\n\n6. **Turn 11 (t=11)**: Move **U (up)** to (4,6).  \n   - Rationale: From (4,5), head direction L, cannot move right. Moving up to (4,6) continues towards (2,5) via (3,6) or (2,6). (4,1) disappears this turn but is risky to reach (due to obstacles). Snake becomes [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)], head direction U. Prepares for future move to (2,5) by turn 14.\n\n#### Why This Sequence?\n- **Scores 1 point** by eating (5,3) on turn 7.\n- **Avoids Risks**: \n  - Skips (1,1) as it's unreachable by turn 9 and low-priority.\n  - Avoids bottom-right dead ends by moving up after turn 7.\n  - No tail reward danger (food not under snake).\n- **Long-term Focus**: After turn 11, snake can head to (2,5) (e.g., via (4,6) → (3,6) → (2,6) → (2,5) by turn 14) for another point. The path keeps the snake in open areas, maximizing survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: L \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 7, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells in each direction. Walls are at the borders and also internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), then body at (4,4). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, I assume. In coordinates, y=0 is probably the bottom, but I need to confirm. Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, since moving down decreases y, let's see: the head is at (4,3), direction D, so moving down to (4,2) or something? Let's parse the movement.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) – so up increases y, D (x,y-1) – down decreases y, L (x-1,y) – left decreases x, R (x+1,y) – right increases x. So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top row, I think. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nCurrent head position (4,3), direction D, so last move was down to (4,3). Since direction is given as current head direction, and it's D, so snake is facing down.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (1,1) life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including this turn, so at turn 10 it will be gone. Similarly, (5,3) life span 3, gone at turn 10; (4,1) life span 4, gone at turn 11; (2,5) life span 7, gone at turn 14; (3,6) life span 10, gone at turn 17.\n\nCurrent turn is 7.\n\nSnake is short, only 2 segments, so growing is important, but I need to avoid risks and think long-term.\n\nAvailable moves: since head direction is D, I can move D (continue down), or L (left), or R (right), but not U (up) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So current direction D, opposite is U, so I cannot move U on this turn. Possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, grid size: from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nList all walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5).\n\nI should sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nLet me make a 8x8 grid, rows y from 0 to 7 (bottom to top? or top to bottom? In terms of y, since U is y+1, probably y=0 bottom, y=7 top. But for drawing, I'll assume y=0 at bottom, but in coordinates, it might not matter as long as consistent.\n\nSet up:\n\n- x from 0 to 7, left to right\n\n- y from 0 to 7, bottom to top (so U increases y)\n\nCurrent snake: head (4,3), body (4,4). So at y=3 and y=4, x=4. Since body is at (4,4), which is above head if y increases up, so head at (4,3) moving down, away from body.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,1) bottom-left area\n\n- (5,3) right of head, same y\n\n- (4,1) directly below head, since head at (4,3), down to (4,2), then (4,1)\n\n- (2,5) left and up\n\n- (3,6) left and up, but higher y\n\n(3,6) is x=3,y=6, which is near top-left.\n\nNow, internal obstacles:\n\n(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nI need to avoid these.\n\nAlso, walls at borders.\n\nCurrent possible moves from (4,3):\n\n- D: down to (4,2)\n\n- L: left to (3,3)\n\n- R: right to (5,3)\n\nNow, check if these are valid:\n\n(4,2): is it wall? Border walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,2) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: list has (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), etc., but (4,2) not in list, so free? But (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) is different cell. Obstacles are specific cells, so (4,2) should be free unless occupied by snake or food, but snake is only at (4,3) and (4,4), so (4,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): not border, not in obstacle list: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). (3,3) not there, so free.\n\n(5,3): not border, not in obstacles, but there is food at (5,3)? Food at (5,3) is listed, but food is not obstacle; food can be eaten, so moving to (5,3) would eat the food.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible actions for turn 7.\n\nActions: D, L, R (since U not allowed)\n\nNow, for each, what happens.\n\nAlso, food life spans: turn 7, so (1,1) life span 3, will disappear at turn 10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it disappears after L turns, meaning it lasts L more turns including this one? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span N, it will be there for this turn and next N-1 turns, so disappears at turn t + N - 1? Example: at turn 7, life span 3, so it is present at turn 7, 8, 9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, life span 4: present at 7,8,9,10, disappears at 11.\n\nLife span 7: present 7 to 13, disappear at 14.\n\nLife span 10: present 7 to 16, disappear at 17.\n\nNow, snake: head at (4,3), body at (4,4). If I eat food, snake grows to length 3, so new tail added.\n\nBut \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,4), head at (4,3), so they are adjacent vertically. Head is below tail? y=3 and y=4, so if y increases up, tail is above head. But adjacent means sharing an edge, so yes, adjacent.\n\nBut the tail cell (4,4) does not have food; food is elsewhere. So no danger now.\n\nFood can be under body, but in this case, body is at (4,4), and no food there listed, so fine.\n\nNow, back to moves for turn 7.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (4,2)\n\nThen, at (4,2), what is there? No food, I think. Food at (4,1), not (4,2). So no eat, snake moves to (4,2), tail moves to (4,3), so new positions: head (4,2), body (4,3). Since no eat, length same.\n\nThen direction becomes D.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (3,3)\n\n(3,3): no food, so snake moves to (3,3), body to (4,3)? Head was (4,3), move left to (3,3), so new head (3,3), body moves to where head was, (4,3). But body segment was at (4,4), so it moves to (4,3), and head to (3,3). Positions: [(3,3), (4,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nOption 3: Move R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) has food! Food at (5,3) with value 1, life span 3.\n\nSo if I move R to (5,3), I eat the food. Then snake grows: new head at (5,3), and tail stays or what? When eat, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so length increases.\n\nOriginal positions: head (4,3), body (4,4)\n\nAfter moving R to (5,3), head now at (5,3), and since eat, we add a new segment, but where? The tail was (4,4), so new positions: head (5,3), then the previous head becomes body, so (4,3) becomes body, and tail (4,4) remains, but since we add a segment, the snake becomes: head (5,3), body (4,3), and tail (4,4)? No.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves and eats, it moves head to new position, and the tail doesn't move, so it grows by one.\n\nPositions: before move, segments: [head: (4,3), body: (4,4)]\n\nAfter move without eat: head moves to new cell, body moves to where head was, tail removed? No, in snake, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo for length 2: positions P0 (head), P1 (tail)\n\nAfter move to new cell N:\n\n- New head: N\n\n- Then the segment that was head becomes body, so P0 moves to N? No.\n\nBetter to think: the body segments follow the head.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no eat, or kept if eat.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If no eat: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So for two segments: head moves to new, the body segment (which was tail) moves to where head was. So new positions: [new_head, old_head]\n\n- If eat: head moves to new position, body segments stay, but a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; we add a new cell at tail.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eat positive food.\n\nSo, for eat: head moves to food cell, the body remains, and a new segment is added at the current tail position? Or the tail stays and we add after.\n\nTypically: when eat, the head moves to the food cell, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n\nFor example: positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n\nMove to C and eat: new positions [C, A, B] or [C, A] and B stays but new segment added? I think it's [C, A] and B is still there, but since we add a segment, it becomes [C, A, B], so length 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, no eat: move to C, no eat, positions become [C, A], and B is removed.\n\nIn this case, from [ (4,3), (4,4) ]:\n\nIf move to (5,3) and eat: new positions: head (5,3), then (4,3) becomes body, and (4,4) remains tail, but since eat, we add a new segment, so positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\n(4,4) is the tail.\n\nIf no eat, move to say (4,2): new positions [ (4,2), (4,3) ], and (4,4) is removed.\n\nNow, for (5,3) eat, so snake becomes [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nDirection becomes R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,3) will be eaten, so it disappears.\n\nOther foods remain.\n\nNow, life spans decrease each turn.\n\nBut for planning, I need to consider future moves.\n\nSince snake is short, I should aim to eat food safely.\n\nAvailable foods: (1,1) at (1,1), life span 3, so must eat by turn 9 or it's gone. Turn 7,8,9 present, gone at 10.\n\n(5,3) at (5,3), life span 3, same.\n\n(4,1) at (4,1), life span 4, present turns 7-10, gone at 11.\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), life span 7, plenty of time.\n\n(3,6) at (3,6), life span 10, even more.\n\nNow, internal obstacles might block paths.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nCurrent position: (4,3)\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), I eat immediately, grow to length 3.\n\nBut is it safe? (5,3) is not wall, not obstacle, so yes.\n\nThen I'm at (5,3) with direction R.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: since direction R, I can go R, U, D, but not L (opposite).\n\nNow, grid around (5,3):\n\n- R: (6,3) — x=6,y=3. Border x=7 is wall, but x=6 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1) are walls, but (6,3) not listed, so should be free. Obstacles are specific cells: (6,4) is wall, but (6,3) not, so ok.\n\n- U: (5,4) — y=4, x=5. Not border. Obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) not listed, so free? List: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), etc. (5,4) not in list, so free.\n\n- D: (5,2) — but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Listed as (5,2), so wall, cannot go there.\n\nAlso, L is not possible because opposite direction.\n\nSo from (5,3), after eating, moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), or D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so only R or U possible.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3), then from (6,3), what can I do? But let's not get ahead.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I could go for other food.\n\nFor example, go down to (4,2) to get closer to (4,1) food.\n\nOr left to (3,3) to go towards (2,5) or (1,1) or (3,6).\n\nBut (1,1) is far, and life span short.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is close but short life span.\n\n(4,1) is below, life span longer.\n\nI need to prioritize based on risk and long-term.\n\nAlso, think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince all food is +1, I should eat as much as possible without dying.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tricky.\n\nList the grid with obstacles.\n\nMake a mental map.\n\nGrid 8x8: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, I think? \"Cells occupied by walls\" - border cells are given as x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. And internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo all these are inaccessible.\n\nNow, snake at (4,3) and (4,4)\n\nFood at (1,1), (5,3), (4,1), (2,5), (3,6)\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is adjacent right.\n\n(4,1) is directly below at (4,1), but there is an obstacle at (5,2) and (5,1), so from (4,3) to (4,1), I need to go down to (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\n(4,2) is free? Let's see: (4,2) not border, not in obstacle list: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5) — (4,2) not there, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) not in obstacles, so free, but is it wall? y=1, not y=0, so not border wall. x=4, not border. Not in internal obstacles, so should be free for food or snake.\n\nBut when I go to (4,1), I eat food.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,2) first.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I go D to (4,2), no eat, then next turn I can go D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (3,3), then I can go towards left side.\n\nOr R to (5,3) to eat immediately.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options for turn 7.\n\nFirst, move R to (5,3): eat food, grow to length 3, positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ], direction R.\n\nThen at turn 8, from (5,3), direction R, possible moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so only R or U.\n\nIf R to (6,3): (6,3) is free, no food, so move to (6,3), no eat, new positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), tail (4,3)? Positions: before turn 8: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nAfter move to (6,3) no eat: head to (6,3), body moves to where head was (5,3), and tail moves to where body was (4,3), so positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) removed.\n\nLength still 3.\n\nThen from (6,3), direction R, can go R, U, D, but R to (7,3): x=7 is border wall, so cannot. U to (6,4): but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot. D to (6,2): is (6,2) free? Not border, not in obstacles: obstacles include (6,1) and (6,4), but not (6,2) or (6,3), so (6,2) should be free. But from (6,3) D to (6,2) is possible.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nFrom (5,3) turn 8, if U to (5,4): (5,4) free? Not border, obstacles: (6,4) wall, but (5,4) not listed, so free. No food, so move to (5,4), positions become [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) removed? After move no eat: head to (5,4), body to (5,3), tail to (4,3), so [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nThen from (5,4), direction U, can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to see if I can eat more food.\n\nBack to turn 7 options.\n\nIf I go R and eat (5,3), I have a snake of length 3, but I might be near the right edge with obstacles.\n\n(5,3) to (6,3) is ok, but from (6,3) I can only go down to (6,2) or up, but up to (6,4) wall, right to (7,3) wall, so only down to (6,2).\n\nThen (6,2): from there I can go L to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or D to (6,1) wall, or R to (7,2) wall, or U to (6,3) but that's back, and since no instant reverse, from (6,3) to (6,2) direction D, then from (6,2) I can go D, L, R, but D to (6,1) wall, R to (7,2) wall, L to (5,2) wall, all dead ends! So (6,2) is a trap.\n\nIf I go from (5,3) U to (5,4), then to (5,5), etc., but there is obstacle at (5,6), so y=6 might be issue.\n\n(5,4) to U (5,5): free, I assume.\n\nThen to U (5,6): but (5,6) is obstacle, wall, cannot. So from (5,5) I can go L to (4,5), R to (6,5), D to (5,4) but reverse not allowed if just came from there, etc.\n\nBut it might be survivable, but I need to get to other food.\n\nPerhaps eating (5,3) now might lead to a dead end soon, so not good for long-term.\n\nNow, option 2: move D to (4,2) on turn 7.\n\nThen no eat, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 8, from (4,2), I can go D to (4,1), L to (3,2), or R to (5,2), but (5,2) is wall, so only D or L.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), I eat the food at (4,1), since it's there. Life span 4, present at turn 7,8,9,10.\n\nSo at turn 8, move to (4,1) and eat, grow to length 3: positions [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]? Before move: head (4,2), body (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (4,1) and eat: head to (4,1), body stays, so (4,2) becomes body, and since eat, add new segment at tail, tail was (4,3), so new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]\n\nThen direction D.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go D, but y=1, D is to (4,0), but y=0 is border wall, so cannot. L to (3,1), or R to (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, wall. So only L to (3,1) possible.\n\n(3,1) is free? Not border, not in obstacles, so yes.\n\nSo must go L to (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,1), no food, positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)? After move from (4,1) to (3,1) no eat: head to (3,1), body to (4,1), and tail (4,2) or what? Positions before: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]\n\nMove head to (3,1), no eat, so new head (3,1), body moves to (4,1), tail moves to (4,2)? The segment that was at (4,2) moves to where body was? Standard: each segment moves to previous position of predecessor.\n\nSo: head was at (4,1), moves to (3,1)\n\nBody was at (4,2), moves to where head was, (4,1)\n\nTail was at (4,3), moves to where body was, (4,2)\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go L to (2,1), U to (3,2), D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, so only L or U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I have food at (1,1) which is close.\n\n(1,1) life span 3, must eat by turn 9.\n\nTurn 7,8,9 present.\n\nAt turn 8, I'm at (3,1) after the above sequence? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,2) no eat\n\nPositions: [ (4,2), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,1) eat, grow to [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 9: from (4,1), only possible move L to (3,1) no eat, positions [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nTurn 10: from (3,1), can go L to (2,1) or U to (3,2)\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), which is adjacent to (2,1) or from (3,1) L to (2,1), then next to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) life span 3, disappears at turn 10, so at turn 10 it is gone? Life span at turn 7 is 3, so present at turn 7,8,9, gone at turn 10.\n\nSo at turn 9, (1,1) is still there, but at turn 10, not.\n\nIn turn 9, I am at (3,1), and (1,1) is at (1,1), which is two cells left: (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1), so I need two moves to eat it.\n\nTurn 9: at (3,1), I can go L to (2,1), then at turn 10, I can go L to (1,1), but at turn 10, (1,1) is gone, since disappears at turn 10? \"Disappears after N turns\", so for life span 3 at turn 7, it is present until turn 9 inclusive, I think.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" with countdown decreasing including current.\n\nAt turn t, food with life span N is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, disappears at turn t+N.\n\nSo for (1,1): life span 3 at turn 7, present at turn 7,8,9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, it is present.\n\nAt turn 10, not present.\n\nSo from (3,1) at turn 9, I can go L to (2,1), no eat (unless food there, but no), positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (4,1)? Before move: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]? Earlier at turn 9 positions: after turn 8 eat, positions [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]? No.\n\nTurn 7: after move D to (4,2), positions [ (4,2), (4,3) ]  (length 2)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,1) eat, so new positions: head (4,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, and since eat, tail (4,3) remains and we add a new segment? No: when eat, head moves to new cell, the body segments stay, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions before move: [ (4,2), (4,3) ]  (head and tail)\n\nAfter move and eat to (4,1): head moves to (4,1), the segment that was head (4,2) is now body, and the tail (4,3) remains, and since eat, a new segment is added at the current tail position, so we have [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] but the new segment is added, so positions are [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] with head at (4,1), tail at (4,3).\n\nYes.\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (3,1) no eat, so head moves to (3,1), body moves to where head was (4,1), tail moves to where body was (4,2), so new positions: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nAt turn 9, (1,1) is still present.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move L to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is free? Not border, not in obstacles, so yes.\n\nMove to (2,1) no eat, positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nThen at turn 10, from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) to eat, but at turn 10, (1,1) disappears, so not present, so if I move to (1,1), it is empty, no food, so just move, no eat.\n\nBut I wanted to eat it.\n\nAt turn 9, when at (3,1), (1,1) is present, but I am at (3,1), (1,1) is at (1,1), which is two cells away: (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1), so I need to be at (2,1) on turn 9 to eat on turn 10? No.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,1). If I move directly to (2,1), that is one move, to (2,1), but (2,1) is not the food position; food is at (1,1). So from (3,1) to (2,1) is not eating, just moving to adjacent cell.\n\nThen from (2,1) at turn 10, I can move to (1,1), but at turn 10, food is gone, so no eat.\n\nTo eat (1,1), I need to be on it when it is present, i.e., by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,1), not at (1,1). I can only move to adjacent cells, so from (3,1) at turn 9, I can go to (2,1) or (3,2) or (3,0) wall, so not to (1,1) directly.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,1) from here because it's too far and life span short.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 8, I am at (4,1), which is even farther from (1,1).\n\nSo in this path, I cannot eat (1,1) because I don't reach it by turn 9.\n\nIf on turn 7 I go directly towards (1,1), but it's at (1,1), I at (4,3), so distance 3 in x, 2 in y, so at least 3 moves away, and turn 7,8,9, so on turn 7 I can move L to (3,3), then turn 8 to (2,3) or (3,2) etc, but not directly to (1,1) by turn 9.\n\nFor example, turn 7 move L to (3,3) no eat.\n\nThen turn 8 from (3,3) can go L to (2,3), D to (3,2), U to (3,4), etc.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), so from (3,3) to (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle! (1,2) is internal wall.\n\nObstacles include (1,2), so (1,2) is wall.\n\nAlso, (2,4) is wall, etc.\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go to (1,1) directly or from above, but (1,2) wall, so only from left or below, but x=0 wall, y=0 wall, so (1,1) can only be accessed from (1,0) but y=0 wall, or (0,1) x=0 wall, or (2,1) or (1,2) but (1,2) wall, so only from (2,1).\n\n(1,1) is at x=1,y=1, adjacent cells: (1,0) y=0 wall, (1,2) obstacle wall, (0,1) x=0 wall, (2,1) which is free, so only accessible from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is accessible from (2,0) wall, (2,2), (1,1) but that's the same, (3,1), etc.\n\nSo to eat (1,1), I must be at (2,1) and move to (1,1) when food is present.\n\nSince only turn 7,8,9, I need to be at (2,1) at turn 8 or turn 9 to move to (1,1) on that turn or next.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, if I am at (2,1), I can move to (1,1) on turn 8 to eat.\n\nOr at turn 9, if at (2,1), move to (1,1) on turn 9 to eat.\n\nBut at turn 7, I am at (4,3), so to reach (2,1) in one move? No, minimum two moves: e.g., to (3,3) then to (3,2) or (2,3), but (2,1) is at y=1.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1) to (2,1), that's three moves.\n\nTurn 7: to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: to (3,2) or (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: if to (3,2), then to (3,1) or (2,2) etc.\n\nTo (2,1) at turn 9 earliest, then turn 10 move to (1,1) but turn 10 food gone.\n\nIf turn 8 I can be at (2,1)? From (4,3) at turn 7, move L to (3,3), then turn 8 move to where? (3,3) to (2,3) or (3,2), not directly to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is not adjacent to (3,3); adjacent are (2,3), (3,2), (4,3), (3,4).\n\nSo from (3,3) to (2,1) not possible directly.\n\nShortest path to (2,1): e.g., (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,1), that's 4 moves, so turn 7,8,9,10, but at turn 10 (1,1) gone.\n\nOr (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,1), same thing.\n\nOr (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1), but (2,2) free? Not in obstacles, but then to (2,1).\n\nStill, at turn 10 to (2,1), then turn 11 to (1,1) but food gone.\n\nSince I need to be at (2,1) by turn 9 to move to (1,1) on turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, if at (2,1), move to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut to be at (2,1) at turn 9, I need to start from turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3), move to say (3,3) or (4,2)\n\nIf move to (3,3), turn 8: from (3,3) move to (3,2) or (2,3)\n\nIf to (3,2), turn 9: from (3,2) move to (3,1) or (2,2) or (4,2) etc, not to (2,1) directly.\n\n(3,2) to (2,1) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2).\n\n(2,1) is adjacent to (2,2), (2,0) wall, (1,1), (3,1).\n\nSo from (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1), then to (2,1).\n\nSo at turn 9, I can be at (3,1) or (2,2), not at (2,1).\n\nThen at turn 10, from (3,1) to (2,1) or from (2,2) to (2,1), but at turn 10, (1,1) gone, so I can move to (2,1) but no food to eat at (1,1).\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (1,1) because I can't reach it by turn 9 with the snake starting from (4,3) at turn 7.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3), it's close, but if I eat it, I might be trapped.\n\n(5,3) can be eaten on turn 7 by moving R.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, it might lead to dead end.\n\n(4,1) can be eaten later, life span to turn 10.\n\n(2,5) and (3,6) have long life span.\n\nSo perhaps for turn 7, I should avoid eating (5,3) to not get stuck, and instead go down to (4,2) to set up for (4,1), or left to (3,3) to explore left area.\n\nBut (4,1) is below, and after eating it, I can go left.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,5) and (3,6), which are up-left.\n\nLet's consider moving L on turn 7 to (3,3).\n\nTurn 7: move L to (3,3) no eat.\n\nPositions: [ (3,3), (4,3) ]  (head and body, tail was (4,4) removed)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 8, from (3,3), direction L, possible moves: L to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2), not R (opposite).\n\nNow, (2,3): not wall, free? Obstacles: (2,4) is wall, but (2,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,4): not wall, free.\n\n(3,2): not wall, free.\n\nAlso, food at (2,5) and (3,6) nearby.\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), which is above.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go U to (3,4), then to (3,5) but (3,5) is obstacle! (3,5) internal wall, so cannot.\n\nOr go L to (2,3), then to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go U to (2,4) wall, D to (2,2), L to (1,3), or R to (3,3) reverse not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3) D to (3,2), then to (3,1) etc.\n\nBut let's see food.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), but (2,4) is wall, so I cannot reach (2,5) directly because adjacent cells: (2,4) wall, (2,6), (1,5), (3,5) wall. (3,5) is wall, (2,4) wall, so only (2,6) or (1,5).\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, x=2, not border.\n\n(1,5) at x=1,y=5.\n\nBut to reach (2,5), I need to come from (2,6) or (1,5) or (3,5) but walls, so only from (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is at (3,6), adjacent cells: (3,5) wall, (3,7) y=7 wall, (2,6), (4,6).\n\nSo accessible from (2,6), (4,6), or (3,7) wall.\n\nSo for (2,5), I can reach it via (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nLife span long, so I can plan.\n\nSimilarly for (3,6), via (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nNow back to turn 7 decision.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to go for (4,1) since it's close and no immediate risk.\n\nBut after eating (4,1), I can only go left, as we saw.\n\nThen I can go to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2) or something, but (1,1) is gone, so no issue.\n\nThen I can go up to (2,3) etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2), so area is a bit constrained.\n\nMaybe go for the long-life food.\n\nBut let's think about the (5,3) option again.\n\nIf I eat (5,3) on turn 7, I am at (5,3) with body at (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nThen turn 8, I can go U to (5,4), since R might lead to dead end.\n\nMove U to (5,4) no eat.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (5,3), tail (4,3)  (since no eat, tail removed? Before move: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]? After turn 7 eat: positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nMove U to (5,4) no eat: head to (5,4), body moves to (5,3), tail moves to (4,3), and (4,4) removed, so positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (5,4), direction U, can go U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so only U or L.\n\nIf U to (5,5): free, no food, positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3)\n\nThen from (5,5), can go U to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so cannot. L to (4,5), R to (6,5), D to (5,4) but reverse not allowed.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nIf L to (4,5), then to (4,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, etc.\n\nOr R to (6,5), then to (6,6) or (7,5) wall, etc.\n\nBut there is food at (3,6) and (2,5), so I can go towards there.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) go L to (4,5), then to (4,6) or (3,5) wall, so to (4,6), then to (3,6) to eat food at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) has food, life span 10, so available.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is also available.\n\nSo it might be possible to survive.\n\nBut in the short term, eating (5,3) gives me growth, but I need to avoid the dead end at (6,3).\n\nSince I can choose to go U from (5,3), it might be ok.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat now, I can go D to (4,2) then to (4,1) to eat later.\n\nBut (4,1) is below, and after eating, I can go left.\n\nLet's compare the two options for turn 7.\n\nOption A: Move R to (5,3) eat\n\n- Immediate reward: +1, length 3\n\n- Then at turn 8, go U to (5,4) to avoid dead end\n\n- Then proceed to left area to eat other food.\n\nOption B: Move D to (4,2) no eat\n\n- Then turn 8 move D to (4,1) eat, +1, length 3\n\n- Then turn 9 move L to (3,1) no eat\n\n- Then can go to (2,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nOption C: Move L to (3,3) no eat\n\n- Then turn 8 can go to (2,3) or (3,2) or (3,4)\n\n- To reach (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nNow, food at (5,3) and (1,1) will disappear soon, but I can't eat (1,1), so only (5,3) is perishable soon.\n\n(4,1) has life span 4, so can be eaten later.\n\nFor long-term, I should eat (5,3) now to grow, then move up to safety.\n\nThen I can access the top-left food.\n\nIf I go down, I might be stuck at bottom-left with fewer options.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,1), I am at (4,1), can only go L to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2), but (2,2) is free, then to (2,3), but (2,4) is wall, so from (2,3) can go U to (2,4) wall, or D to (2,2), or L to (1,3), or R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) is free? Not border, not in obstacles, so yes.\n\nThen I can go to (1,4) or something, but (1,2) is wall, so area is open.\n\nBut there is food at (2,5) above, but to reach it, I need to go to (2,6) first, as (2,4) wall.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), I can go to (1,5) or (2,6), then to (2,5).\n\nSimilarly from bottom.\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nWhereas from top, it might be easier.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacles block some paths.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) is directly below, but there is an obstacle at (5,2), which might not affect directly.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nI think for turn 7, moving R to eat (5,3) is beneficial because I grow immediately, and then I can move up to open area.\n\nIf I go D, I eat later but might be cornered.\n\nGo L, no immediate growth.\n\nSo I'll go with R.\n\nThen for turn 8, from (5,3), go U to (5,4) to avoid the right dead end.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,5) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for several turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 7.\n\nSo I need to plan turns 7 to 12 or something.\n\nBut the state might change, so I need to specify the sequence.\n\nSince food life spans decrease, and I eat some, I need to simulate.\n\nLet's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 7: Move R to (5,3) eat food. New positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] direction R.\n\nTurn 8: From (5,3), direction R, move U to (5,4) no eat. Positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), tail (4,3)  (since no eat, (4,4) removed). New positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] direction U.\n\nTurn 9: From (5,4), direction U, possible moves U, L, R (not D). U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so only U or L. Let's go U to (5,5) no eat. Positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3)  (move to (5,5), body to (5,4), tail to (4,3)? Before: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] move head to (5,5) no eat: head to (5,5), body moves to (5,4), tail moves to (5,3), so positions [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ] and (4,3) removed. Direction U.\n\nTurn 10: From (5,5), direction U, can go U to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, cannot. L to (4,5), R to (6,5), D to (5,4) reverse not allowed. So L or R. Let's go L to (4,5) no eat. (4,5) free? Not wall, not obstacle, so yes. Positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (5,4)  (move to (4,5), body to (5,5), tail to (5,4)). New positions [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] direction L.\n\nNow, food at (3,6) is at (3,6), which is close. From (4,5), I can go to (4,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, so only U to (4,6) or L to (3,5) wall, so U to (4,6).\n\nTurn 11: From (4,5), direction L, but I moved to (4,5), direction is L, but from (4,5), moves: since direction L, I can go L, U, D, not R.\n\nL to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, cannot. U to (4,6), D to (4,4), or R not allowed.\n\nD to (4,4) or U to (4,6).\n\n(4,4) might be occupied or not, but currently free.\n\nGo U to (4,6) to approach (3,6).\n\n(4,6) has no food, I think. Food at (3,6), not (4,6).\n\nSo move U to (4,6) no eat. Positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)  (before: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] move head to (4,6), body to (4,5), tail to (5,5), so positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] and (5,4) removed? Tail was (5,4), moves to where body was (5,5), so new tail at (5,5), positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] direction U.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go to (3,6) to eat food at (3,6).\n\nTurn 12: From (4,6), direction U, can go U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, cannot. L to (3,6), R to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, D to (4,5), not allowed reverse? Direction U, so opposite is D, cannot move D. So only L or R, but R to (5,6) wall, so only L to (3,6).\n\nMove L to (3,6) eat food. Positions: head (3,6), then body (4,6), and since eat, tail stays and new segment, so positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ] and add new at tail, tail was (5,5), so new positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]? When eat, head moves to food, body segments follow, but tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBefore move: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nMove to (3,6) eat: head to (3,6), body moves to (4,6), tail moves to (4,5), and since eat, add new segment at previous tail position, so new positions: [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ] and (5,5) with new segment? The tail was at (5,5), it moves to (4,5), but we add a new segment where the tail was before move, I think.\n\nRule not specified, but typically in snake, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so we add a new cell at the tail position after the move.\n\nStandard: after moving to food, the head is at new position, the body segments move as usual, but instead of removing the tail, we keep it, so length increases by one.\n\nSo for positions before move: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove to D and eat: new positions [D, A, B] and C remains, so [D, A, B, C] if we add after, but C is still there, so positions become [D, A, B] and C, but since no remove, it's [D, A, B, C].\n\nIn this case, before turn 12 move: positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] with head (4,6), tail (5,5)\n\nMove to (3,6) eat: head to (3,6), the segment that was head (4,6) becomes new body at (4,6), the body (4,5) moves to where head was? Body segments move to previous position.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo body segment at B moves to where A was, C moves to where B was.\n\nThen if eat, C doesn't move, and we add a new segment at the position where C was before moving.\n\nAfter moving, C is at new position, but we add a new segment at the old position of C.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nCommon implementation: when snake moves without eating, head to new, each segment to previous position of the segment in front.\n\nWith eating, same but tail doesn't move, new segment added at tail position.\n\nFor example: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n\nMove to new cell N:\n\n- If no eat: new head N, then P0 to N, P1 to P0, P2 to P1, ..., Pk to P_{k-1}, and Pk removed? No, Pk moves to P_{k-1}, and the cell Pk is vacated.\n\nThe positions become: [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}]\n\nP0 was head, now becomes first body segment at P0 position.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf eat: head to N, then P0 to N, P1 to P0, P2 to P1, ..., Pk to P_{k-1}, but Pk does not move, and we add a new segment at Pk position, so positions [N, P0, P1, ..., Pk] with new head N.\n\nIn this case, for three segments before: [A, B, C]\n\nAfter move and eat to N: new positions [N, A, B, C]\n\nC remains at C.\n\nIn my earlier, at turn 11 positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] head (4,6), tail (5,5)\n\nMove to (3,6) eat: new head (3,6), then A = (4,6) moves to where head was? Head was at (4,6), moves to (3,6), so the segment that was at (4,6) is now at (4,6)? No.\n\nHead at (4,6) moves to (3,6).\n\nThe body segment at (4,5) moves to the previous position of the head, which is (4,6).\n\nThe tail at (5,5) moves to the previous position of the body, which is (4,5).\n\nThen since eat, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving, which is (5,5).\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,6), then body at (4,6) (where head was), then body at (4,5) (where the first body was), then tail at (5,5) (new segment added), so [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nYes.\n\nBut for now, in planning, it might be ok.\n\nBack to turn 7.\n\nI think for turn 7, moving R to eat (5,3) is a good choice.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output turns 7 to 11 or 12.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,5), which I can eat later.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the perishable food since I can't eat (1,1) and (5,3) is only one.\n\nBut eating (5,3) is easy.\n\nAnother option: on turn 7, move D to (4,2), then turn 8 move D to (4,1) eat, then turn 9 move L to (3,1), then turn 10 move L to (2,1) or U to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut no food eaten except (4,1).\n\nThen I can go to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut (2,5) is above.\n\nFrom (3,1) turn 9, go U to (3,2), then turn 10 to (3,3), then to (3,4), but (3,4) free, then to (3,5) wall, cannot, so to (2,4) wall, cannot, so from (3,3) go to (2,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\nNot directly to (2,5).\n\nTo reach (2,5), need to go to (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nFrom bottom, it might take more turns.\n\nWhereas from the top, it's easier.\n\nSo I think initial plan is better.\n\nI'll go with turn 7: R\n\nThen turn 8: U\n\nThen turn 9: U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 10: L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11: U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 12: L to (3,6) eat\n\nBut for answer, I need to list actions for current turn and next few.\n\nSince turn 7 is current, I need actions from turn 7 onwards.\n\nIn the box, list from turn 7 to as many as I can, but at least 5 turns.\n\nLet's list 5 turns: 7 to 11.\n\nTurn 7: action\n\nTurn 8: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 11 is U to (4,6)\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nPerhaps I should include turn 12 to eat the food.\n\nBut for now.\n\nAnother food: (2,5) at (2,5), I can go there after.\n\nBut in this sequence, I am at (4,6) at turn 11, then to (3,6) eat on turn 12.\n\nFor the answer, I can list up to turn 12.\n\nBut the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the turns starting from current.\n\nI think for turn 7, move R to eat (5,3).\n\nThen for turn 8, move U to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,4) I have options, I chose U to (5,5), but I could go L to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) was body, but now it might be free.\n\nIn turn 8, after move to (5,4), positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ], so (4,4) is free.\n\nIf I go L to (4,4) on turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,4), move L to (4,4) no eat.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3)  (before: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] move to (4,4), body to (5,4), tail to (5,3), positions [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ] direction L.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (4,5) or (3,4) or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied or not, but in positions, tail is at (5,3), so (4,3) free.\n\nBut to reach (3,6), from (4,4) go U to (4,5), etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut going to (5,5) might be fine.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll output:\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen later to eat (3,6).\n\nBut in turn 10, I moved L to (4,5), then turn 11 U to (4,6).\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 7):**\n- Snake head at (4,3), direction down (D), body at (4,4). Snake length is 2.\n- Food available:\n  - (1,1): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (4,1): value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 10).\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 13).\n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 16).\n- Walls and obstacles: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). These cells are deadly and inaccessible.\n\n**Immediate Moves (Turn 7):**\n- Current head direction is D, so cannot move U (reverse). Possible moves: D (down to (4,2)), L (left to (3,3)), or R (right to (5,3)).\n- Moving R to (5,3) eats the positive food (+1, length increases to 3) and avoids the short life span (must be eaten by turn 9). This is prioritized for immediate growth.\n- Moving D to (4,2) delays eating but sets up for (4,1) later; however, (4,1) has a longer life span (until turn 10), so it can be eaten later with less urgency.\n- Moving L to (3,3) explores the left area but has no immediate food and risks missing perishable food.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize survival and growth:** After eating (5,3), move upward to avoid the dead end near (6,3) (due to walls and obstacles). Then target (3,6) or (2,5) for further growth, as they have long life spans.\n- **Avoid risks:** (1,1) is inaccessible by turn 9 due to distance and obstacles (e.g., (1,2) is a wall), so it is ignored. The area near (4,1) is risky after eating (bottom-left corner with limited escape), so it is avoided initially.\n- **Path to (3,6):** After eating (5,3), move U to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then U to (4,6), and finally L to (3,6) to eat the food on turn 12. This path avoids walls and uses open spaces.\n- **Sequence ensures safety:** Moves are chosen to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. The snake grows steadily, and the plan keeps it in the central/top area for better mobility.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 7 to 12):**\n- **Turn 7 (current):** Move R to (5,3) to eat food (+1, length 3). New positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4). Direction: R.\n- **Turn 8:** Move U to (5,4) to avoid dead end near (6,3). No food eaten. New positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), tail (4,3). Direction: U.\n- **Turn 9:** Move U to (5,5) to continue toward open area. No food eaten. New positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3). Direction: U.\n- **Turn 10:** Move L to (4,5) to approach (3,6). No food eaten. New positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (5,4). Direction: L.\n- **Turn 11:** Move U to (4,6) to set up for (3,6) food. No food eaten. New positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5). Direction: U.\n- **Turn 12:** Move L to (3,6) to eat food (+1, length 4). New positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5). Direction: L.\n\n**Why this sequence maximizes score and survival:**\n- Eats two high-value foods quickly ( (5,3) on turn 7 and (3,6) on turn 12), increasing length to 4 by turn 12.\n- Avoids all walls and obstacles: Path is clear with no collisions.\n- Manages food life spans: (5,3) is eaten before it expires; (3,6) is eaten with ample time.\n- Long-term focus: After turn 12, the snake can target (2,5) or other foods from a safe position.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12\\text{: L} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 8, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? Let me check.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. That means the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0) and (x,7) for all x are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6, I believe. Let's confirm with snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]. So (5,3), (4,3), (4,4). x=5 and 4, y=3 and 4, all between 1 and 6, so yes, playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. So these cells are also blocked, like walls.\n\nSnake head direction is R, meaning right. So the snake is moving right, with head at (5,3), body at (4,3), tail at (4,4)? Positions: head is first, so (5,3) is head, then (4,3) is first body segment, (4,4) is tail. Since it's a list, index 0 is head, index 1 is next, etc. So head at (5,3), moving right.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (1,1) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,1) with life span 3, value 1\n\n- (2,5) with life span 6, value 1\n\n- (3,6) with life span 9, value 1\n\nAll food have value 1, so all are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all.\n\nLife span: for (1,1), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span), countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (1,1), life span 2 at turn 8. So on turn 8, life span is 2, after turn 8 it becomes 1, after turn 9 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1): life span 3, so disappears after turn 10 (since turn 8:3, turn 9:2, turn 10:1? Wait no.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning:\n\n- On turn t, countdown L\n\n- After turn t, countdown L-1\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (1,1) at turn 8, life span 2: after turn 8, countdown 1; after turn 9, countdown 0, disappears. So available on turn 8 and 9.\n\n(4,1): life span 3, available turn 8,9,10; disappears after turn 10.\n\n(2,5): life span 6, available turn 8 to 13? Turn 8:6, after turn 8:5, ..., after turn 13:0, disappear? Let's calculate:\n\nStart turn t: countdown L\n\nAfter turn t: countdown L-1\n\n...\n\nAfter turn t + (L-1): countdown 1\n\nAfter turn t + L: countdown 0, disappear. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n\nFor (1,1): L=2, t=8, can be eaten turn 8 or 9.\n\n(4,1): L=3, t=8, can be eaten 8,9,10.\n\n(2,5): L=6, t=8, can be eaten 8 to 13.\n\n(3,6): L=9, t=8, can be eaten 8 to 16.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,3), direction R, so moving right.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Reverse of R is L, so I cannot move L on next turn. But this is for the current turn, turn 8.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so for turn 8, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L is opposite.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, it depends on the direction I choose.\n\nAlso, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nLet me sketch a 6x6 grid, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: border is all around, but since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, the cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nList:\n\n(6,4) - obstacle\n\n(5,1) - obstacle\n\n(2,4) - obstacle\n\n(6,1) - obstacle\n\n(1,2) - obstacle\n\n(5,6) - obstacle\n\n(5,2) - obstacle\n\n(3,5) - obstacle\n\nAnd snake: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nFood: (1,1), (4,1), (2,5), (3,6)\n\nNow, head at (5,3), moving right, so if it moves R, it goes to (6,3). But (6,3) is not an obstacle? Obstacles are (6,4), (6,1), etc. (6,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nBut x=6 is border? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is within 1 to 6, so (6,3) should be free unless obstacle. Obstacles include (6,1) and (6,4), but not (6,3). (6,1) is obstacle, (6,4) is obstacle, (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6) are free? But (6,1) and (6,4) are obstacles, so (6,2) and (6,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 to 6.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,3):\n\n- Up: (5,4)\n\n- Down: (5,2)\n\n- Left: (4,3) but (4,3) is the body segment, but since the snake is moving, when head moves, the body follows, so moving to (4,3) might be possible if it's the tail, but let's see.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, the tail is at (4,4). Current positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4).\n\nIf head moves left to (4,3), which is occupied by the body segment. But (4,3) is not the tail; the tail is (4,4). So (4,3) is a body segment, not tail. If head moves to (4,3), it would collide with body, so death.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (5,2): is (5,2) free? (5,2) is an obstacle? Obstacles include (5,2), yes, (5,2) is in the list: (5,2) obstacle.\n\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,6) are obstacles, but (5,3) is snake head, so (5,2) is obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nMoving up to (5,4): is it free? (5,4) not listed as obstacle or snake, so should be free.\n\nMoving right to (6,3): not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\nMoving down to (5,2) is invalid because obstacle.\n\nMoving left to (4,3) is invalid because body collision, since (4,3) is body segment and not tail.\n\nTail is at (4,4), which is different.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,3) with direction R:\n\n- U: to (5,4)\n\n- D: to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid\n\n- L: to (4,3) but occupied by body, invalid\n\n- R: to (6,3) free, valid\n\nSo only two possible moves: U or R.\n\nD and L are invalid.\n\nNow, I need to choose between U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nBut I have to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food locations: (1,1), (4,1), (2,5), (3,6)\n\n(4,1) is food, but (4,1) is obstacle? Obstacles include (5,1), (6,1), but (4,1) is not listed as obstacle. Let's see internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), but (4,1) is not there, so it should be free and has food.\n\n(4,1) has food, value 1.\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, which is above the wall? y=0 is wall, but y=1 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has food, etc.\n\nNow, snake is at (5,3), head.\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), then new head position (6,3). Since I ate no food, length unchanged, so tail moves away. Current positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4). After move R to (6,3), new head (6,3), body becomes (5,3) and (4,3), tail (4,4) moves? When head moves to new cell, the body follows: the segment that was at (4,3) moves to (5,3), and the tail at (4,4) moves to (4,3)? Standard snake movement.\n\nPositions: before move: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nAfter move R: head to (6,3), then body: the first body segment moves to head old position, so (4,3) moves to (5,3), and tail (4,4) moves to (4,3). So new positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTail is now (4,3).\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), new positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]? Head to (5,4), body (4,3) moves to (5,3), tail (4,4) moves to (4,3)? Tail was (4,4), moves to where the previous segment was? Let's think.\n\nThe snake moves: head to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo segments: index 0: head, index 1: body1, index 2: body2 (tail)\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, new body1 at old head position, new body2 at old body1 position.\n\nSo before move: pos[0] = (5,3), pos[1] = (4,3), pos[2] = (4,4)\n\nAfter move U to (5,4): new head = (5,4), new body1 = old head (5,3), new body2 = old body1 (4,3)\n\nSo positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nSimilarly, after R to (6,3): [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nNow, I need to consider the food and plan ahead.\n\nFood life spans:\n\n(1,1): life span 2, so available turn 8 and 9, disappears turn 10.\n\n(4,1): life span 3, available turn 8,9,10, disappears turn 11.\n\n(2,5): life span 6, available turn 8 to 13, disappears turn 14.\n\n(3,6): life span 9, available turn 8 to 16, disappears turn 17.\n\nBut turn 8 is current, so we need to act.\n\nSince I must think 5+ turns ahead, let's consider possible paths.\n\nFirst, if I move R to (6,3) on turn 8.\n\nThen positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nNow, from (6,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but direction now R? After moving R, new direction is R.\n\nCurrent direction was R, I moved R, so new direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but no instant reverse, so cannot move L (opposite of R).\n\nSo can move U, D, R.\n\nNow, (6,3): U to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacle (6,4), yes, so cannot move U.\n\nD to (6,2): is (6,2) free? Not obstacle, not snake? Obstacles: (6,1) and (6,4) are obstacles, (6,2) and (6,3) are free, but (6,3) is now head, so (6,2) should be free unless something.\n\n(6,2) not listed as obstacle, so free.\n\nR to (7,3), but x=7 is wall, since border x=7 is wall, so cannot move R.\n\nx=7 is wall, so moving right from x=6 to x=7 is invalid.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,4) obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (6,2) free, valid\n\n- L: (5,3) but (5,3) is now body segment, not tail. After move, positions [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ], so (5,3) is body, not tail. Tail is (4,3). So moving left to (5,3) would be body collision, invalid.\n\n- R: (7,3) wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,2).\n\nSo if I move R on turn 8, then on turn 9 I must move D to (6,2).\n\nNow, after moving D to (6,2) on turn 9.\n\nNew positions: head to (6,2), body: old head (6,3) moves to body, but let's see.\n\nBefore move: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove D to (6,2): new head (6,2), new body1 = old head (6,3), new body2 = old body1 (5,3)\n\nSo positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ]\n\nNow, from (6,2), direction is D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (opposite of D).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\n- D to (6,1): but (6,1) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- L to (5,2): (5,2) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- R to (7,2) wall, invalid\n\n- U to (6,3) but (6,3) is now body segment, not tail. Positions: (6,3) is body, tail is (5,3). So moving to (6,3) body collision, invalid.\n\nAll moves invalid? That can't be right.\n\n(6,2) to D: (6,1) obstacle\n\nL: (5,2) obstacle\n\nR: (7,2) wall\n\nU: (6,3) which is occupied by body.\n\nAnd since no other cells, the snake is trapped and will die if it stays or moves.\n\nBut moving U to (6,3) is body collision, so death.\n\nTherefore, if I move R on turn 8, I end up in a dead end on turn 9, with no safe moves, leading to death.\n\nSo moving R is very risky, actually fatal in this case.\n\nTherefore, I should not move R on turn 8.\n\nThe only other option is U to (5,4).\n\nSo let's explore moving U to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nAfter move U: positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nDirection was R, now moved U, so new direction U.\n\nNow, from (5,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nNo instant reverse: reverse of U is D, so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- U to (5,5): is it free? (5,5) not obstacle, not snake, should be free.\n\n- D: cannot, because reverse, invalid\n\n- L to (4,4): but (4,4) is not occupied now? After move, positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ], so (4,4) is free? Previously tail was at (4,4), but after move U, tail is at (4,3), so (4,4) is empty.\n\nIs (4,4) obstacle? Not listed, so free.\n\n- R to (6,4): (6,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food: (1,1), (4,1), (2,5), (3,6)\n\n(4,1) is below, but I'm at (5,4), so not close.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), y=5.\n\n(3,6) at (3,6).\n\nLife spans: (1,1) available turn 8,9; (4,1) available 8,9,10; etc.\n\nSince (1,1) has short life, only 2 turns left, I might want to get it if possible, but it's far.\n\nCurrent position (5,4).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) on turn 8? Turn 8 I move U to (5,4), then for turn 9, I can move from (5,4).\n\nBut let's plan multiple steps.\n\nFirst, on turn 8, move U to (5,4).\n\nThen for turn 9, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nOption 1: move L to (4,4) on turn 9.\n\nAfter moving L to (4,4): positions before turn 9: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove L to (4,4): new head (4,4), new body1 = old head (5,4), new body2 = old body1 (5,3)\n\nSo positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nDirection now L.\n\nNow from (4,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nNo instant reverse: reverse of L is R, so cannot move R.\n\nCan move U, D, L.\n\nCheck cells:\n\n- U to (4,5): free? Not obstacle, not snake.\n\n- D to (4,3): but (4,3) is now body? Positions: (5,3) is body, (4,3) is not occupied? New positions [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ], so cells occupied: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3). (4,3) is free, and not obstacle.\n\n(4,3) should be free.\n\n- L to (3,4): free? Not obstacle.\n\n- R: cannot, reverse.\n\nSo moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4).\n\nAll possible.\n\nNow, food at (2,5) is at (2,5), which is above, and (3,6) at (3,6).\n\n(4,1) at (4,1), but y=1.\n\nIf I go to (4,4), I might head towards (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nBut (1,1) is almost expired.\n\nTurn 9: (1,1) can be eaten on turn 9, last chance, since after turn 9 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) can be eaten turn 9 or 10.\n\nBut from (4,4), to reach (1,1) in one move? No, (4,4) to (1,1) is not adjacent.\n\n(4,4) to (1,1) is |dx|=3, |dy|=3, not adjacent.\n\nSo cannot reach on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (4,1) from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), then from there to (4,2) or something, but (4,2) may be free.\n\nLet's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn 9 choices from (5,4).\n\nI could move U to (5,5) instead of L.\n\nMove U to (5,5) on turn 9.\n\nAfter move: positions before: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove U to (5,5): new head (5,5), new body1 = (5,4), new body2 = (5,3)\n\nPositions: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow from (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nNo instant reverse, cannot move D (reverse).\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\n- U to (5,6): but (5,6) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- L to (4,5): free? Not obstacle\n\n- R to (6,5): free? Not obstacle, (6,5) not in list\n\n- D: invalid\n\nSo moves: L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\nNow, (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and up, but from (4,5) or (6,5), I can reach.\n\nAlso (3,6) at (3,6).\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should aim for food, but avoid risks.\n\nFirst, the path via moving U on turn 8 and then L on turn 9 seems better for reaching food.\n\nBut let's consider the dead end we had if I moved R.\n\nMoving U on turn 8 is safer.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to survive.\n\nAlso, there is a risk about tail reward danger, but no food on tail now.\n\nTail is at (4,3) after turn 8 move U.\n\nFood at (4,1), but not on tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's think about getting the food with short life span first.\n\n(1,1) must be eaten by turn 9, else it disappears.\n\nCan I reach (1,1) by turn 9?\n\nCurrent after turn 8: if I move U to (5,4), on turn 8.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,4), (1,1) is not adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,5), not adjacent.\n\nAnd (1,1) is at (1,1), which is far.\n\nThe closest I can be on turn 9 is at (4,4) or (5,5), both at least distance 3 from (1,1), so impossible to reach on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nSo (1,1) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 9.\n\nSo I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\n(4,1) can be eaten turn 9 or 10.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 8, after move U.\n\nOn turn 9, if I move L to (4,4), then from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) on turn 10? Let's see.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4) move L to (4,4), positions [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nThen turn 10: from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is free? Positions now: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ], so (4,3) is empty.\n\nMove D to (4,3): new head (4,3), new body1 = (4,4), new body2 = (5,4)\n\nPositions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) ]\n\nNow, (4,1) is at (4,1), so from (4,3), I can move down to (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\nBut is (4,2) free? Not obstacle, I think.\n\nObstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) has food.\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, and below is wall, but it's playable.\n\nFrom (4,3), move D to (4,2) on turn 11? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,3)  // now at (4,3)\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (4,1) to eat food.\n\nBut (4,1) life span: available until turn 10? Life span 3 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: countdown 3\n\nAfter turn 8: countdown 2 (available turn 9)\n\nAfter turn 9: countdown 1 (available turn 10)\n\nAfter turn 10: countdown 0, disappear, so not available turn 11.\n\n(4,1) can be eaten turn 8,9,10.\n\nOn turn 10, I am at (4,3), and I move to (4,2) or something, but (4,1) is at (4,1), which is adjacent to (4,2)? (4,3) to (4,1) is not adjacent, |dy|=2.\n\nFrom (4,3), to reach (4,1), I need to move down twice.\n\nBut on turn 10, I am at (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) on turn 10, then on turn 11 to (4,1), but turn 11 is after turn 10, so (4,1) disappears after turn 10, not available on turn 11.\n\nTherefore, I can only eat it on turn 10 if I am at adjacent cell on turn 10.\n\nBut on turn 10, if I am at (4,2), then I can move to (4,1) on turn 10? No.\n\nTo eat on turn t, I need to move to the food cell on turn t.\n\nSo for (4,1), I need to be on (4,1) on or before turn 10.\n\nOn turn 10, I can be there.\n\nBut to be on (4,1) on turn 10, I need to arrive there on turn 10.\n\nFrom current, after turn 8: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move to, say, (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: from (4,4) I can move to (4,3), but not directly to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,1) in one move? No.\n\nThe only way to reach (4,1) by turn 10 is to be closer earlier.\n\nFor example, if on turn 9 I am at a cell adjacent to (4,1), then on turn 9 I can eat it.\n\n(4,1) adjacent cells: (4,2), (5,1), (3,1), (4,0) but y=0 wall, so (4,2), (5,1), (3,1).\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, so only (4,2) and (3,1).\n\n(3,1) not listed obstacle, should be free.\n\nBut (3,1) is at x=3,y=1.\n\nNow, on turn 9, I can be at (4,4) or (5,5), neither adjacent to (4,1) or (4,2).\n\n(4,4) to (4,2) is not adjacent.\n\nSo on turn 9, I cannot be adjacent to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, on turn 10, I can be at (4,3) if I moved accordingly, but (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2), not to (4,1).\n\nTo be at (4,2) on turn 10, for example.\n\nFrom turn 8 position (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: if I move D? But from (5,4), I cannot move D because no instant reverse, direction is U, reverse is D, cannot move D.\n\nOn turn 9, from (5,4), I can only move U or L or R, but R invalid, so U or L.\n\nU to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nNeither gets me closer to (4,1) quickly.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) on turn 9, then on turn 10 from (4,4) I can move D to (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 11, I can move D to (4,2), but (4,1) gone.\n\nIf on turn 10 I move directly, but (4,4) to (4,1) not possible.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (4,1) by turn 10 with the current path.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, but on turn 8 I am at (5,3), if I could move down, but I couldn't because (5,2) obstacle.\n\nOr left, but body collision.\n\nSo I cannot get to (4,1) in time; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) also cannot be eaten.\n\nSo forget about those, focus on (2,5) and (3,6) with longer life.\n\n(2,5) available until turn 13, (3,6) until turn 16.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nAfter turn 8 move U to (5,4), positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nOn turn 9, I can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), positions [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5), since U to (5,6) invalid obstacle.\n\n(6,5) is free, not obstacle.\n\nNow, (2,5) is at (2,5), so moving L to (4,5) gets closer.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) at (3,6).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) on turn 9, positions [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), or L to (3,4).\n\n(4,5) is closer to (2,5) and (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), (3,6) at (3,6), so (4,5) is adjacent to both? (4,5) to (2,5) |dx|=2, not adjacent; to (3,6) |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not adjacent, diagonal not adjacent, only orthogonal.\n\nSo need to move closer.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is obstacle, which is at (3,5).\n\n(2,5) is food at (2,5), but (3,5) is obstacle, so to reach (2,5), I need to go via (2,4) or (2,6), but (2,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) blocked.\n\n(2,6) not listed, but y=6, y=7 is wall, so (2,6) is playable if not obstacle.\n\nObstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5), (3,5) obstacle, etc.\n\nTo reach (2,5):\n\nAdjacent cells: (2,4) obstacle, (2,6), (1,5), (3,5) obstacle.\n\nSo only (2,6) and (1,5) are accessible.\n\n(1,5) not obstacle, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,6): adjacent cells (3,5) obstacle, (3,7) wall, (2,6), (4,6).\n\n(4,6) not obstacle, free.\n\n(2,6) free.\n\nSo (3,6) can be reached from (2,6), (4,6), or (3,5) but obstacle, so from (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nNow, back to the snake.\n\nAfter turn 8 at (5,4), move on turn 9.\n\nOption A: move U to (5,5) on turn 9.\n\nPositions: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen on turn 10, from (5,5), move L to (4,5) (since U invalid, R to (6,5) possible but let's see).\n\nMove L to (4,5): new positions [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow at (4,5), I can go towards (2,5) or (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), but (3,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\nMove U to (4,6): (4,6) free? Not obstacle.\n\nMove D to (4,4): free.\n\nMove R to (5,5) but body, invalid.\n\nNo instant reverse, direction L, reverse R, cannot move R.\n\nSo can move U, D, L.\n\nL to (3,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\nU to (4,6)\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf U to (4,6), positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nThen (4,6) is close to (3,6), which is adjacent.\n\n(3,6) at (3,6), (4,6) to (3,6) is left, so on turn 11, I can move L to (3,6) to eat food.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nFirst, if I move D to (4,4) on turn 10, then at (4,4), which is less useful.\n\nBut let's continue the U move.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 10, if I move U to (4,6), then on turn 11, from (4,6), I can move L to (3,6) to eat (3,6) food.\n\nAfter eating, length increases.\n\nPositions before move: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nMove L to (3,6): new head (3,6), since ate food, new body: the body segments, and a new segment is added at the tail? When eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so the tail stays, and new position added.\n\nSo after move to food cell, head moves to food, and since food eaten, new segment added, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? Standard: when snake eats, the head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows by one cell.\n\nPositions: before eating, snake at positions S.\n\nHead moves to new cell (food), and the tail stays, so the new positions are [new_head] + S, but S includes the old head to tail.\n\nAfter move without eating: positions [new_head, old_head, ..., old_body2] but old_body2 is the tail before move, which moves to old_body1 position.\n\nWhen eating: head moves to new cell, the body moves as usual, but since food eaten, after the move, the tail is not removed, so the snake has one more segment.\n\nSpecifically: the movement is the same, but after moving, instead of removing the tail, we keep it, so the new tail is the old tail position, but since we add a segment, the positions are new_head, then the old positions of all segments.\n\nExample: before move, positions [A, B, C] A head, C tail.\n\nMove to new cell D: without eating, new positions [D, A, B] and C is removed.\n\nWith eating: new positions [D, A, B, C] so C is still there, tail is C.\n\nIn this case, from [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nNew head (3,6), then body: old head (4,6) becomes new body1, old body1 (4,5) becomes new body2, old body2 (5,5) becomes new body3 (tail), and since ate, we add a new segment? No: the tail is not removed, so positions become [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] so tail at (5,5).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to the choice.\n\nIn this path: turn 8: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: from (5,5) move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5) move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,6) move L to (3,6) to eat food.\n\nBut (3,6) life span 9, available until turn 16, so on turn 12 it's fine.\n\nNow, after eating, positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] length 4.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut let's see if I can get (2,5) as well.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), available until turn 13.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move to (2,6) or (4,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle.\n\n(2,6) or (4,6).\n\n(2,6) is free.\n\nThen from (2,6) to (2,5) is down, but (2,5) adjacent.\n\nBut need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's consider the other option on turn 9.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move L to (4,4) instead.\n\nAfter turn 8: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4), positions [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 10: from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), or L to (3,4).\n\nNow, (4,5) is good for reaching (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nMove U to (4,5) on turn 10.\n\nPositions: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4) ]\n\nDirection U? Moved up.\n\nThen from (4,5), turn 11: can move U, D, L, R, no reverse (from U, cannot D).\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,6), L to (3,5) obstacle, R to (5,5) but (5,5) may be free or not.\n\n(5,5) not obstacle, but in this path, on turn 11, positions before move: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4) ], so (5,5) is free.\n\nR to (5,5) possible.\n\nU to (4,6) possible.\n\nL to (3,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo move U to (4,6) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf U to (4,6), same as before, then to (3,6).\n\nIf R to (5,5), then at (5,5), which is where we were earlier.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), from (4,5) I could move L but obstacle, so I need to go via (4,6) or (3,4) etc.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 10, if I move L to (3,4) instead.\n\n(3,4) free? Not obstacle.\n\nThen positions [ (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) ]\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so (3,3), (3,5) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, so to (3,3) or (4,4) etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is above, so not direct.\n\nTo reach (2,5), I need to go to (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), it might be longer.\n\nSo the efficient way is to go up towards (4,6) and (3,6).\n\nNow, about (2,5), it is available until turn 13.\n\nFrom (3,6), after eating (3,6), I can go to (2,6) then to (2,5).\n\n(2,6) is free, as established.\n\nThen from (2,6) move D to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut need to check if possible.\n\nFirst, let's outline a plan starting from turn 8.\n\nSince moving R is fatal, I must move U on turn 8.\n\nSo turn 8: U\n\nThen on turn 9, I need to choose.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then up to (4,6), then left to (3,6) to eat around turn 11-12.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) on turn 9, then I can go up to (4,5) on turn 10, then to (4,6) on turn 11, then to (3,6) on turn 12, same as above.\n\nBut from (4,4), moving to (4,5) on turn 10 is similar to being at (4,5) earlier.\n\nIn the first option, with turn 9 U to (5,5), turn 10 L to (4,5), I am at (4,5) on turn 10.\n\nIn second option, turn 9 L to (4,4), turn 10 U to (4,5), also at (4,5) on turn 10.\n\nSame position on turn 10.\n\nThen from there, I go to (4,6) on turn 11, to (3,6) on turn 12.\n\nNow, after eating (3,6) on turn 12, positions say [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] or depending on path.\n\nThen I can go for (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,6), move L? But (3,6) to left is (2,6), since (2,6) is free.\n\nMove to (2,6) on turn 13.\n\nThen from (2,6), move D to (2,5) on turn 14.\n\nBut (2,5) life span 6 at turn 8, available until turn 13? Life span 6, t=8, can be eaten turn 8 to 13, disappears turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: after turn 13, countdown 0, disappear, so not available turn 14.\n\nOn turn 13, I can eat it if I am there.\n\nOn turn 13, if I move to (2,5), I can eat.\n\nFrom above, on turn 12 I eat (3,6) at (3,6).\n\nThen on turn 13, from (3,6), I can move to (2,6) or (4,6) or (3,5) invalid.\n\nIf move to (2,6), then positions: before move [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] assume tail (5,5)\n\nMove to (2,6): new head (2,6), new body1 (3,6), new body2 (4,6), new body3 (4,5), tail (5,5) moves? Without eating, tail moves, so new positions [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ] and (5,5) removed.\n\nBut I didn't eat, so length same.\n\nThen on turn 14, from (2,6), I can move to (2,5) or (1,6) or (2,7) wall, or (3,6) body.\n\n(3,6) is body, so cannot.\n\n(2,5) down, (1,6) left.\n\n(2,5) is food, but on turn 14, it may be gone.\n\n(2,5) disappears after turn 13, so on turn 14 not available.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to be at (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nBut on turn 13, from (3,6), I can only move to adjacent cells: (2,6), (4,6), (3,5) invalid, (3,7) wall.\n\nSo (2,6) or (4,6).\n\n(2,6) is not (2,5), so I cannot reach (2,5) on turn 13 from (3,6).\n\nThe only way is to be at (2,6) or (1,5) on turn 12, then move to (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nBut on turn 12, I am at (3,6) eating, so I can only move on turn 13.\n\nAfter eating on turn 12 at (3,6), on turn 13 I move to (2,6), then on turn 14, (2,5) is gone.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,6) and go to (2,5) first.\n\n(2,5) available until turn 13.\n\nFrom current, can I reach (2,5) by turn 13?\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: say move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) or to (3,5) invalid, so U to (4,6)\n\nThen on turn 12: from (4,6), I can move to (3,6) or to (2,6)? (2,6) not adjacent to (4,6), |dx|=2.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move L to (3,6) or U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), R to (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo only L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n\nIf I move to (3,6) on turn 12, I eat, but (2,5) not reached.\n\nIf on turn 11 from (4,5), instead of U, I could move, but only U or D or L invalid, R to (5,5).\n\nIf move R to (5,5) on turn 11.\n\nBut (5,5) not helpful for (2,5).\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 11, I can only go to (4,6) or (5,5) or (4,4), but not directly to (2,5).\n\nTo reach (2,5) by turn 13, I need to be closer on turn 12.\n\nFor example, on turn 12 at (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nBut from current path, on turn 11 at (4,6), which is not close.\n\nAfter turn 8 U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: from (4,4) move L to (3,4) instead of U.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\nPositions [ (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) ]\n\nThen turn 11: from (3,4), can move U to (3,5) obstacle, invalid; D to (3,3); L to (2,4) obstacle, invalid; R to (4,4) body, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (3,3).\n\nMove to (3,3): positions [ (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nThen turn 12: from (3,3), can move U to (3,4) body, invalid; D to (3,2); L to (2,3); R to (4,3).\n\n(2,3) free, etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at y=5, I am at y=3, so far, and on turn 12, I need to reach by turn 13.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,5) not adjacent, and |dy|=2, so at best turn 13 at (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or (2,5) directly? Not possible in one move from (3,3).\n\nSo I think I cannot reach (2,5) in time; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, only (3,6) is reachable and has long life.\n\nSo I should go for (3,6).\n\nNow, back to the answer format.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 8, then turn 9, etc., but the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since I need to think ahead, perhaps output a sequence for the next few turns.\n\nBut the user didn't specify how many to output, but in the answer format it shows multiple turns.\n\nProbably for the immediate decision and a few ahead.\n\nSince turn 8 is current, I need to decide turn 8 action, and perhaps the next few.\n\nBut for survival, I should plan a path.\n\nGiven that moving R is fatal, I must move U on turn 8.\n\nThen on turn 9, I can move U or L, both can lead to (4,5) on turn 10.\n\nThen to (4,6) on turn 11, to (3,6) on turn 12.\n\nFor example.\n\nBut on turn 9, if I move U to (5,5), from (5,4), direction U, move U to (5,5), then on turn 10 from (5,5) move L to (4,5).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) on turn 9, then on turn 10 from (4,4) move U to (4,5).\n\nSame result.\n\nBut moving to (5,5) might be riskier because (5,6) is obstacle above, so at (5,5), I can only move L or R, R to (6,5) or L to (4,5).\n\n(6,5) is free, but then I might go right, away from food.\n\nBut to reach food, moving L is better.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4), moving U to (4,5) is direct.\n\nSo I think moving L on turn 9 is fine, or U.\n\nBut let's choose one.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the tail reward danger, but no issue now.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no food under body.\n\nSo for turn 8, action U.\n\nThen for turn 9, say move L to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 10 move U to (4,5).\n\nTurn 11 move U to (4,6).\n\nTurn 12 move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions, not positions.\n\nAnd for the sequence, I can output up to turn 12 or so.\n\nBut the format might expect the actions for the turns.\n\nSince the state is at turn 8, I need action for turn 8, and perhaps the AI should output for turn 8, then the next actions can be based on new state, but here I need to provide a sequence.\n\nI think for this response, I should provide a sequence of actions for the next few turns.\n\nNow, to be safe, after turn 8 U, on turn 9 moving L to (4,4) might be better because from (4,4) I have more options: U, D, L, while from (5,5) I have only L and R, and U invalid.\n\nIn terms of flexibility, (4,4) is better.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,5) on turn 9, then on turn 10 I must move L or R, if I move L to (4,5), fine, but if for some reason I need to go down, I cannot immediately because no reverse.\n\nWhereas from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) if needed.\n\nBut in this case, to go for food, up is fine.\n\nI think both are ok, but let's go with moving L on turn 9.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nThen turn 10: from (4,4) move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5) move U to (4,6)  (since to go to (3,6))\n\nOn turn 11, from (4,5), direction after turn 10 move U to (4,5), so direction U.\n\nThen move U to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,6) move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut move L, direction was U, moving L is not reverse, so ok.\n\nThen after that, I can continue, but for the answer, perhaps output up to turn 12.\n\nSince the food will be eaten, and I survive.\n\nBut on turn 12, when I move to (3,6), I eat, so positions grow.\n\nThen I can explore.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think for now.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: L (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 10: U (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 11: U (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 12: L (to (3,6))\n\nNow, in the sequence, for turn 12, I move L to (3,6) and eat.\n\nBut I need to make sure no collision.\n\nWhen moving to (3,6), is there body? Before move, positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (4,4) or something, but in the path.\n\nAfter turn 11: positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (4,4) ]? Let's trace.\n\nStart turn 8: after move U: positions [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4): positions [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ]\n\nTurn 10: move U to (4,5): positions [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4) ]\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6): positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (4,4) ]\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,6): (3,6) is free, not body, so ok, eat food, new positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4) ]\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut (4,4) is now body, etc.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIf on turn 9 I moved U, similar.\n\nBut in this case, with moving L on turn 9, I have a path.\n\nNow for the answer, I think output turns 8 to 12.\n\nBut turn 12 action is for that turn.\n\nPerhaps I should include the eat action.\n\nBut the action is just move.\n\nNow, another thing: in the initial, if I move U on turn 8, and then on turn 9 move U or L, but I chose L.\n\nTo confirm, is there any risk?\n\nFor example, on turn 11, at (4,5), moving U to (4,6), is (4,6) safe? Yes.\n\nThen to (3,6).\n\n(3,5) is obstacle, so no issue.\n\nAlso, the tail reward: but no food on tail.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, for turn 8, action U.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves for the next 5 turns (turns 8 to 12). The key considerations are:\n- Moving right (R) on turn 8 leads to a dead end on turn 9 with no safe moves, resulting in death. Thus, moving up (U) is the only safe initial choice.\n- The food at (1,1) and (4,1) cannot be reached before they expire (after turns 9 and 10, respectively), so they are ignored.\n- The food at (3,6) has a long life span (available until turn 16) and is reachable by turn 12. This is prioritized for scoring.\n- The path to (3,6) is safe and avoids collisions, with the snake growing after eating the food on turn 12.\n- All moves adhere to the \"no instant reverse\" rule and avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\n### Plan Details:\n- **Turn 8 (current)**: Move U to (5,4). This avoids the fatal right move and positions the snake to access the upper area.\n- **Turn 9**: Move L to (4,4). This moves toward the food at (3,6) and maintains flexibility.\n- **Turn 10**: Move U to (4,5). This continues the path upward, closer to (3,6).\n- **Turn 11**: Move U to (4,6). This positions the snake adjacent to (3,6) for eating.\n- **Turn 12**: Move L to (3,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 4). This is safe, as (3,6) is not under the body and no tail reward danger exists.\n\nAfter turn 12, the snake can continue exploring for other food (e.g., (2,5) if still available) or prioritize survival.\n\n### Output Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: L  \nTurn 10: U  \nTurn 11: U  \nTurn 12: L  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 9, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, typically in such grids, x from 0 to 7 means 8 cells, but walls occupy x=0 and x=7, so playable x should be 1 to 6. Similarly for y, playable y from 1 to 6. Let's list all walls.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7 for all y? The input says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So it means all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), inclusive. That's a 6x6 grid? x from 1 to 6, that's 6 units, similarly y, so 36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n\nSo these are additional walls.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,4), then body at (5,3), and tail at (4,3). So the snake has 3 segments.\n\nSnake head direction: U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 1 (so it will disappear after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 9, if life span is 1, after turn 9 it will be gone, meaning it can be eaten on turn 9 only, I think. Let me read the life-span rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIt says: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at the turn it appears, countdown is N. After that turn, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then it disappears after that turn? I need to clarify.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that when food is spawned, it has a life_span of N. On each turn, including the turn it appears, the life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn. So it can be eaten on turns when life_span >=1.\n\nFor example, if life_span is 1 on turn t, then on turn t, it can be eaten, and after turn t, it disappears, so not available on turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, if life_span is 2, it can be eaten on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nIn this case, for food:\n\n- (1,1): value 1, life_span 1 → can be eaten only on turn 9, disappears after.\n\n- (4,1): value 1, life_span 2 → can be eaten on turn 9 and 10, disappears after turn 10.\n\n- (2,5): value 1, life_span 5 → can be eaten from turn 9 to 13, disappears after turn 13.\n\n- (3,6): value 1, life_span 8 → can be eaten from turn 9 to 16.\n\nAll values are +1, since it says \"value1\", and from the food list, all have value 1, so all positive food, no negative food here.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move D on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions: U (continue up), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders: so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles (walls): (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nList:\n\n- (6,4) wall\n\n- (5,1) wall\n\n- (2,4) wall\n\n- (6,1) wall\n\n- (1,2) wall\n\n- (5,6) wall\n\n- (5,2) wall\n\n- (3,5) wall\n\nSnake: head (5,4), body (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nSo positions: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSince head is at (5,4) and moving U, which is (x,y+1), so up means increasing y, I assume? In coordinates, usually y increases upwards or downwards?\n\nThe movement: U (x,y+1), so U is up, increasing y, D is down, decreasing y, L left decreasing x, R right increasing x.\n\nIn grid, typically (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? But here, walls are given, so we can work with coordinates.\n\nFor example, head at (5,4), move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is a wall, as per internal obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is the body segment, but it's not the tail, so if I move there, I collide with body.\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves, so if head moves to where tail is, it might be ok, but only if the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's collision and death.\n\nIf head moves to the tail cell, and the tail moves away, it's ok, but only if after moving, the head is on the tail cell and the tail moves, so no collision.\n\nAlso, for food under body: if food is under a body segment, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nNow, current snake positions: (5,4) head, (5,3) body, (4,3) tail.\n\nSo cells occupied: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- U: to (5,5)\n\n- D: to (5,3) but (5,3) is body segment, not tail, so if I move there, head touches body, collision, death. So cannot move D.\n\n- L: to (4,4)\n\n- R: to (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo actually, only possible moves are U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nD is invalid because of body, R is invalid because of wall.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's list all food positions:\n\n- (1,1): value 1, life_span 1 → must be eaten this turn or not at all. But turn 9, if I eat it now, but it's far away.\n\n- (4,1): value 1, life_span 2 → can be eaten turn 9 or 10\n\n- (2,5): value 1, life_span 5 → turns 9-13\n\n- (3,6): value 1, life_span 8 → turns 9-16\n\nNow, snake at (5,4), head.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), what happens?\n\nNew position: head to (5,5), then the body: the segment at (5,3) moves to where head was, (5,4)? Let's think how snake moves.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo current: positions: index 0: head (5,4), index 1: body (5,3), index 2: tail (4,3)\n\nAfter move U:\n\nHead moves to (5,5)\n\nThen segment 1 (body) moves to previous head position (5,4)\n\nSegment 2 (tail) moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (5,3)\n\nBut (5,3) is now empty? No: after head moves, the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3)\n\nTail was at (4,3), but it moves to where the body was, which is (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (4,4):\n\nHead to (4,4), body to (5,4), tail to (5,3)? Tail was at (4,3), moves to where body was, (5,3).\n\nCurrent body positions: (5,4) head, (5,3) body, (4,3) tail.\n\nAfter move L to (4,4):\n\n- Head moves to (4,4)\n\n- Body segment (at (5,3)) moves to previous head position (5,4)\n\n- Tail segment (at (4,3)) moves to previous body position (5,3)\n\nSo new snake: head (4,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3)\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (5,5): head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3)\n\nNow, for eating: if head moves to a food cell, it eats it and grows.\n\nWhen it eats, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake length increases.\n\nRule: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n\nSo when eaten, the snake grows, meaning the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail.\n\nSo after eating, positions: head moves to new cell, body segments shift, but tail stays, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new tail is added? Let's see.\n\nTypically in snake, when it eats, the head moves to food, the body moves as usual, but the tail doesn't retract, so the snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: after move, if no eat, head to new, each body to previous position.\n\nIf eat, head to new, each body to previous position, and tail stays, so the last segment doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, during the move, the head moves to food cell, the body shifts, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment. The new tail is the old tail, and it stays, while a new segment is added where the tail was supposed to be.\n\nAfter move without eating: new head position, and each segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the tail leaves its cell.\n\nWith eating: head moves to food, body segments move to previous positions, but the tail segment does not move, so it stays, and the new position of the tail is the same as before. Then, the next segment that was attached now becomes the new tail position? I'm confusing myself.\n\nPerhaps: the snake has segments. When moving without eating, all segments move: head to new, each subsequent to previous position, so tail leaves its cell.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to new (food), each body segment moves to previous position, but the tail segment does not move, so it stays, and the snake gains one segment; the new segment is at the position where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it's the same cell, so effectively, the tail stays, and the segment before it becomes the new body, but length increases.\n\nFor example, snake of length 3: positions A(head), B, C(tail)\n\nMove to new cell D without eating: new positions D(head), A, B(tail) — C is gone.\n\nWith eating at D: new positions D(head), A, B, C(tail) — C stays, so from A,B,C to D,A,B,C, length 4.\n\nIn this case, C remains, so the cell C is still occupied.\n\nIn terms of movement: after eating, the tail doesn't advance, so the position where the tail was remains occupied by the tail.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nCurrent turn, t=9.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 9.\n\nOptions: U or L.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving U to (5,5).\n\nThen new snake: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3)\n\nFood at (5,5)? No, food is at (1,1), (4,1), (2,5), (3,6). (5,5) has no food, so no eat.\n\nNow, direction: since I moved U, new head direction is U.\n\nPossible next moves from (5,5): U, L, R, but not D (reverse).\n\nU to (5,6): but (5,6) is wall? Internal obstacles: (5,6) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nL to (4,5)\n\nR to (6,5): is (6,5) wall? Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, (6,1) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, and not border? x=6, y=5, border walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so x=6 is playable, y=5 playable. Internal walls: (6,4), (6,1), not (6,5), so (6,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) should be free.\n\nBut let's list all walls to be sure.\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nInternal walls: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(5,6) is wall, yes.\n\nSo from (5,5):\n\n- U to (5,6): but (5,6) is wall, cannot.\n\n- D to (5,4): but (5,4) is body segment now? After move, snake is at (5,5) head, (5,4) body, (5,3) tail. So (5,4) is occupied by body, not tail, so moving D to (5,4) would collide with body. Also, D is reverse, since current direction U, so cannot move D anyway.\n\n- L to (4,5): possible\n\n- R to (6,5): possible, since no wall.\n\n(6,5) is not border, not internal wall, so free.\n\nNow, if I move L to (4,5), that might be good.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 9, if I move U, I go to (5,5), which is empty, no food.\n\nNow, food (1,1) has life_span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears, so I lose that food.\n\nBut (1,1) is at bottom-left, I'm at (5,5), far away, so impossible to eat it this turn. So (1,1) will be lost anyway, since I can't reach it in one move from (5,4) to (1,1), too far. So forget about (1,1), it's gone.\n\nNow, other foods: (4,1) life_span 2, so can be eaten turn 9 or 10.\n\n(2,5) life_span 5, turns 9-13\n\n(3,6) life_span 8, turns 9-16\n\nNow, from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\nLet's consider moving L to (4,5) on turn 10, for example.\n\nBut I need to plan actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince I have to output actions for turn 9, then turn 10, etc., but the answer format is to output actions starting from turn 9, for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the output is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nHow many? It doesn't say, but I think I should provide at least 5 actions or so, but let's see.\n\nPerhaps I can simulate both choices for turn 9.\n\nFirst option: move U on turn 9 to (5,5)\n\nThen snake: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3), direction U.\n\nNow turn 10: possible moves from (5,5): L to (4,5) or R to (6,5)\n\nSay I move L to (4,5)\n\nThen new head (4,5), body to (5,5), tail to (5,4)? After move: head to (4,5), body segment moves to previous head (5,5), tail moves to previous body (5,4). But previous body was (5,4), which is now tail position.\n\nNew snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (5,4)\n\nDirection now L, since I moved left.\n\nFood at (4,5)? No.\n\nNow from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, so cannot.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nU to (4,6): y=6, is it wall? y=6 is not border, border y=7 and y=0, so y=6 playable. But internal walls? (3,5) is wall, but (4,6) not listed, so free.\n\nD to (4,4): possible.\n\nL to (3,5): but (3,5) is internal wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (4,5), can move U to (4,6) or D to (4,4) or L to (3,5) but (3,5) wall, so only U or D.\n\nBut D to (4,4): is it safe? (4,4) may be free now.\n\nAfter previous moves, cells: at turn 10 after move to (4,5), snake at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\n(4,4) is free, I think.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn 9.\n\nSecond option for turn 9: move L to (4,4)\n\nThen new snake: head (4,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, is there food at (4,4)? Food list: (1,1), (4,1), (2,5), (3,6), no (4,4), so no eat.\n\nNow from (4,4), turn 10 possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nPossible: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4)\n\nNow, (4,3): is it occupied? Snake has tail at (5,3), so (4,3) is free? Positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3). So (4,3) is free, no food.\n\nU to (4,5): free\n\nD to (4,3): free\n\nL to (3,4): free, no wall? (3,4) not listed as wall, internal walls include (3,5), not (3,4), so free.\n\nBut (3,5) is wall, but (3,4) is different.\n\nNow, food (4,1) is at (4,1), which is below, life_span 2, so can be eaten turn 9 or 10.\n\nOn turn 10, if I move D from (4,4) to (4,3), then I'm closer to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at y=1, x=4.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move D to (4,3), then to (4,2), then to (4,1), but (4,2): is it free? Walls: (5,2) is wall, but (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (4,1) has food, but (4,1) is not wall? Internal walls: (5,1) is wall, but (4,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, border y=0 and y=7 are walls, but y=1 is not border, so playable.\n\nInternal walls: (5,1) is wall, but (4,1) is different cell.\n\nSo (4,1) is free and has food.\n\nBut life_span 2, so on turn 10, it can be eaten.\n\nIf I move to (4,3) on turn 10, then from there, on turn 11, I can move to (4,2) or other, then to (4,1) on turn 11, but life_span 2, on turn 10 it can be eaten, turn 11 it might be gone if life_span decreases.\n\nLife_span at turn 9: for (4,1) it is 2, so on turn 9, life_span=2, after turn 9, it decreases to 1, so on turn 10, life_span=1, can be eaten, after turn 10, disappears.\n\nSo to eat (4,1), I need to be on (4,1) on turn 10.\n\nBut on turn 9, I am at (4,4) if I moved L on turn 9.\n\nFrom (4,4), on turn 10, I can move U, D, L.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), I am at (4,3), not at (4,1), so I can't eat it on turn 10.\n\nTo eat on turn 10, I need to be at (4,1) on turn 10.\n\nFrom (4,4), the only way to reach (4,1) in one move is impossible, since I can only move one cell per turn.\n\nSo I cannot eat (4,1) on turn 10 from (4,4); the closest I can be is (4,3) or (3,4) or (5,4), but (5,4) is body.\n\nSo I can only reach (4,1) on turn 11 at earliest, but on turn 11, (4,1) is gone, since after turn 10 it disappears.\n\nTurn 9: food (4,1) life_span=2, so available turn 9 and 10.\n\nAfter turn 10, gone.\n\nSo to eat, must be on (4,1) on turn 9 or 10.\n\nOn turn 9, I was at (5,4), and I could move to (4,4) or (5,5), not to (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,4), to (4,1) is three steps away: e.g., down twice and left or something, but in one move, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot eat (4,1) on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 10, to eat (4,1), I need to be on (4,1) on turn 10.\n\nBut on turn 10, I am at (4,4) if I moved L on turn 9, or at (5,5) if I moved U.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 10, I can move to (4,3), (4,5), or (3,4), all not (4,1), so I can't reach (4,1) on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5) on turn 10, I can move to (4,5) or (6,5), not to (4,1).\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (4,1) at all, because I can't reach it on turn 9 or 10 from current position.\n\nIs that right?\n\nCurrent position turn 9: (5,4)\n\nTo reach (4,1) on turn 9: impossible, not adjacent.\n\nOn turn 10: to be at (4,1), I need to move from a cell adjacent to it on turn 9.\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,1) are: U (4,2), D (4,0) but y=0 wall, L (3,1), R (5,1) but (5,1) is wall, internal obstacle.\n\nSo only possible from (4,2) or (3,1).\n\n(3,1): is it free? Not wall, internal walls: (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), not (3,1), so free.\n\nBut on turn 9, I am at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (4,2) or (3,1); (5,4) to (4,2) is not adjacent, distance in x and y.\n\nAdjacent means sharing edge, so (5,4) adjacent to (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4).\n\nNone of which are (4,2) or (3,1).\n\n(4,2) is adjacent to (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2), but (5,2) wall.\n\nOn turn 9, I can be at cells adjacent to (4,1) only if I were already adjacent, but I'm not.\n\nSo yes, it's impossible to eat (4,1) on turn 9 or 10. Therefore, (4,1) will disappear without being eaten, since I can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is also impossible, as it's even farther.\n\nSo only foods I can target are (2,5) and (3,6).\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), life_span 5, so available turns 9 to 13.\n\n(3,6) at (3,6), life_span 8, turns 9 to 16.\n\nNow, snake at (5,4) turn 9.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), I am closer to (3,6) and (2,5).\n\n(5,5) to (3,6) is close, but (3,6) has wall at (3,5)? (3,5) is wall, so I need to go around.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is at (2,5).\n\nNow, let's consider the two choices.\n\nFirst, move U on turn 9 to (5,5).\n\nThen snake: (5,5) head, (5,4) body, (5,3) tail, direction U.\n\nTurn 10: from (5,5), can move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5). (U and D not possible, as earlier.)\n\nSuppose I move L to (4,5), as it's towards the left where foods are.\n\nNew head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (5,4), direction L.\n\nNow turn 11: from (4,5), can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), or L to (3,5) but (3,5) wall, so only U or D.\n\nSay I move U to (4,6).\n\nThen head to (4,6), body to (4,5), tail to (5,5)? After move: head (4,6), body to previous head (4,5), tail to previous body (5,5). New snake: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nFood at (4,6)? No, food at (3,6), which is adjacent.\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), which is adjacent to (4,6)? (4,6) to (3,6) is left, so L move.\n\nBut on turn 11, I am at (4,6), and (3,6) is food.\n\nIf I move L to (3,6), I can eat it.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\n(3,6) has food, value 1, so I eat and grow.\n\nAlso, life_span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6) on turn 11, if I move L to (3,6) on turn 12.\n\nTurn 11: I moved to (4,6), no eat, snake: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nThen turn 12: move L to (3,6), which has food, so eat.\n\nThen after eating: head moves to (3,6), body moves to previous head (4,6), tail does not move, so stays at (5,5), and snake grows, so new positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), and tail (5,5), and a new segment? When eating, tail stays, so the segment at (5,5) remains, and since body moves to (4,6), which was head, so new snake: head (3,6), segment 1 (4,6), segment 2 (5,5) tail? Length increases to 4.\n\nOriginal length 3, after eating, length 4.\n\nPositions: before move turn 12: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nMove head to (3,6), which is food, so eat.\n\nBody segment moves to previous head position (4,6)\n\nTail does not move, stays at (5,5)\n\nSo new snake: head (3,6), body (4,6), body (5,5) wait no: segments: head at (3,6), the first body segment at (4,6) (previous head), the second body segment at (4,5) (previous body position), but the tail should stay, so the segment that was at (4,5) becomes the new body, and the tail at (5,5) remains as tail? I think I have it.\n\nStandard: positions before move: let's index: pos0 head (4,6), pos1 body (4,5), pos2 tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move with eat: head moves to new cell (3,6), pos1 moves to where pos0 was (4,6), pos2 does not move, stays at (5,5), and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it's the same, so effectively, the tail stays, and the segment before it becomes part of body.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5) — so from three segments to four: head, body1, body2, tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in this case, on turn 12, I eat at (3,6).\n\nBut on turn 11, I am at (4,6), and I can move directly to (3,6) on turn 12.\n\nBut turn 11 is after turn 10.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) or D to (4,4)\n\nIf I move U to (4,6), then on turn 12, I can move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut (3,6) is available, no problem.\n\nNow, after eating, snake at (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) — head, body, body, tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, I can consider other foods.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is below.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move to (2,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) is wall, so cannot move D or L? Directions: head at (3,6), direction L (since last move was L to (3,6)).\n\nSo possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (3,5) wall, cannot; L to (2,6); R to (4,6) but (4,6) is body, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (2,6)\n\nThen to (2,6), which is free? (2,6) not wall, so ok.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) to eat, but (2,5) has food.\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), which is down from (2,6).\n\nSo move D to (2,5).\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nFirst, back to turn 9 choice.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move L to (4,4)\n\nThen snake: head (4,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 10: from (4,4), can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4)\n\nNow, (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move L to (3,4), then U to (3,5) but (3,5) wall, cannot.\n\nOr from (4,4) move U to (4,5), then to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,5), I need to go left.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4) on turn 10.\n\nThen head to (3,4), body to (4,4), tail to (5,4)? After move: head (3,4), body to previous head (4,4), tail to previous body (5,4). New snake: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (5,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 11: from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) but (3,5) wall, cannot; D to (3,3); L to (2,4); R to (4,4) but (4,4) body, cannot.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nSo possible: D to (3,3) or L to (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is wall? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo only D to (3,3)\n\nThen to (3,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to (2,3) or (3,2), but (2,5) is at (2,5), so I need to go up.\n\nBut (3,3) to (2,5) not direct.\n\nMoreover, (2,5) life_span 5, available until turn 13, so I have time.\n\nBut in this path, I am going down, away from (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), I had to move D to (3,3) because no other choice.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) but (3,4) is body? After moving to (3,3), snake: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (4,4)? Positions: after move D from (3,4) to (3,3): head to (3,3), body to previous head (3,4), tail to previous body (4,4). So snake: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 12: from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4) but (3,4) body, collision; D to (3,2); L to (2,3); R to (4,3)\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nSo possible: D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3)\n\n(3,2) not wall, (2,3) not wall? Internal walls: (1,2) wall, but (2,3) not, so free. (4,3) not wall.\n\nBut (2,5) is above, so moving down or left takes me away.\n\nTo reach (2,5), from (3,3), I need to go to (2,3) or (3,4) but (3,4) occupied, so to (2,3), then to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, cannot, or to (2,3) then to (1,3) or (2,2), but (2,5) is at y=5, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move U to (2,4) but wall, or to (1,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nNo direct way to (2,5) because (2,4) is wall, and (3,5) is wall, so (2,5) is isolated? Let's see the grid around (2,5).\n\n(2,5) at (2,5)\n\nAdjacent cells: U (2,6), D (2,4) but (2,4) wall, L (1,5), R (3,5) but (3,5) wall.\n\nSo only accessible from U (2,6) or L (1,5).\n\n(2,6) not wall, (1,5) not wall? x=1, y=5, border x=0 wall, but x=1 playable, y=5 playable.\n\nInternal walls: (1,2) wall, but (1,5) not, so free.\n\nSo to reach (2,5), I must come from (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nIn the first path, when I went to (4,6) then (3,6), I can go to (2,6) then to (2,5).\n\nBut in this path with turn 9 move L, I am at (3,3) on turn 11, which is far and stuck in a corner.\n\nMoreover, (3,6) is above, I might not reach it easily.\n\nSo the move U on turn 9 seems better to reach the foods.\n\nNow back to the U move plan.\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 10: move L to (4,5)  // towards left\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), move U to (4,6)  // up to row 6\n\nThen turn 12: move L to (3,6) and eat the food there. // since (3,6) has food\n\nAfter eating, snake: head (3,6), body (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)  // length 4\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 13: from (3,6), only possible move is L to (2,6), since U, D, R not possible as before.\n\nMove L to (2,6)\n\nNo food, so snake moves: head to (2,6), body to previous head (3,6), body to (4,6), tail to (4,5)? After move without eat: head to (2,6), segment1 to (3,6), segment2 to (4,6), tail to (4,5) — tail was at (5,5), moves to where previous body was, which was (4,6)? Positions before move: head (3,6), body1 (4,6), body2 (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move head to (2,6), body1 moves to where head was (3,6), body2 moves to where body1 was (4,6), tail moves to where body2 was (4,5)\n\nSo new: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, (2,5) is at (2,5), which is directly below (2,6).\n\nSo on turn 14, I can move D to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut (2,5) has food, life_span 5, which started at turn 9, so on turn 14, what is life_span?\n\nLife_span at turn 9: 5, so after turn 9, 4; turn 10, 3; turn 11, 2; turn 12, 1; turn 13, 0? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 9, life_span=5, after turn 9, it decreases to 4, meaning on turn 10, life_span=4.\n\nGenerally: at turn t, if food has life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t if L >=1, and after turn t, L decreases by 1.\n\nSo for (2,5), at turn 9, life_span=5, so available turns: 9,10,11,12,13 (since on turn 13, life_span=1, can be eaten, after turn 13, disappears).\n\nLife_span=5 at turn 9:\n\n- Turn 9: L=5, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 9: L=4\n\n- Turn 10: L=4, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 10: L=3\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 13: L=1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 13: L=0, disappears\n\nSo on turn 14, it is gone.\n\nTherefore, to eat (2,5), I need to be on (2,5) on or before turn 13.\n\nIn this plan, on turn 14, I move to (2,5), but on turn 14, (2,5) is gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nProblem.\n\nOn turn 13, I am at (2,6), and (2,5) is below, so I can move D to (2,5) on turn 13 to eat it.\n\nTurn 13: I am at (2,6), move D to (2,5), which is food, so eat.\n\nYes, on turn 13, it is available.\n\nLife_span at turn 13: from above, on turn 13, L=1, can be eaten.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 12: at (4,6), move L to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 13: at (3,6), move L to (2,6) — but on turn 13, I can directly move to (2,5) from (2,6)? No, from (3,6) to (2,6) or other.\n\nAfter turn 12: snake at (3,6) head, (4,6) body, (4,5) body, (5,5) tail? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 12 eat: positions head (3,6), body (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 13: from (3,6), I move to (2,6) as planned, but (2,6) has no food, so no eat.\n\nBut I need to eat (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can only move to (2,6), not directly to (2,5).\n\nThen from (2,6) on turn 13, I can move to (2,5) on turn 14, but turn 14 too late.\n\nOn turn 13, from (3,6), I must move to (2,6), since only choice.\n\nThen on turn 14, from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5), but (2,5) gone.\n\nBut on turn 13, after moving to (2,6), (2,5) is still available? Turn 13: at (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) on turn 13? Turn 13 action is from current position.\n\nTurn 13 start: I am at (3,6), I move to (2,6), so after move, on turn 13, I am at (2,6), and (2,5) is not eaten yet.\n\nThen on turn 14, I move from (2,6) to (2,5) to eat, but on turn 14, (2,5) is gone.\n\nLife_span: on turn 13, (2,5) can be eaten, but I am not on it; I am on (2,6).\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to be on (2,5) on turn 13, but I can only be there if I move from (2,6) or (1,5) or (2,4) but (2,4) wall.\n\nOn turn 13, I start at (3,6), which is not adjacent to (2,5), so I cannot reach (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nThe only way to be on (2,5) on turn 13 is to have been adjacent on turn 12.\n\nOn turn 12, I was at (4,6) before moving, or after moving to (3,6).\n\nOn turn 12, I move from (4,6) to (3,6), so at start of turn 12, I am at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent to (2,5); adjacent cells of (2,5) are (2,6), (1,5), (2,4) wall, (3,5) wall.\n\n(2,6) is adjacent.\n\nOn turn 12, if I were at (2,6), I could move to (2,5) on turn 12 or 13.\n\nBut in the plan, on turn 12, I am at (4,6) moving to (3,6), not at (2,6).\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,5) in time; the latest I can be at (2,6) is turn 13, but then on turn 14 I move to (2,5) which is gone.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (2,5) with this path.\n\nI need to adjust to eat (2,5) earlier.\n\nFor example, from turn 9, instead of going up to (5,5), I could go left to (4,4), then try to go towards (2,5).\n\nBut earlier when I tried, I got stuck.\n\nOn turn 9, move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 10, move U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11, move U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 12, move L to (3,6) eat\n\nThen turn 13, move L to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 14, move D to (2,5) but too late.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFrom (4,6) on turn 12, instead of moving to (3,6), I could move to (2,6) directly? No, from (4,6) to (2,6) not adjacent.\n\nI need to go to (2,6) first.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), which I can reach from (3,6) or (2,5) or (1,6), etc.\n\nBut to eat (2,5), I need to be at (2,6) or (1,5) on a turn when I can move to (2,5).\n\nSince (2,5) available turns 9-13, I can move to it on turn 13 from (2,6).\n\nSo I need to be at (2,6) on turn 12 or 13.\n\nOn turn 12, if I am at (2,6), I can move to (2,5) on turn 12 or 13.\n\nOn turn 13, if I am at (2,6), I can move to (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nBut on turn 13, (2,5) can be eaten.\n\nSo if I am at (2,6) on turn 13, I can move D to (2,5) on turn 13 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 12 at (2,6), I can move D on turn 12 or 13.\n\nBut on turn 12, it's earlier.\n\nNow, from current position, can I reach (2,6) by turn 12?\n\nTurn 9: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,5) or (4,4)\n\nIf move U to (5,5), turn 9\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,6), I can move L to (3,6) or, but to go to (2,6), I need to go left twice, but from (4,6) to (3,6) to (2,6), so on turn 12 move to (3,6), turn 13 to (2,6), then turn 14 to (2,5) too late.\n\nFrom (4,6) on turn 12, I can only move to (3,6) or, what other moves? From (4,6), after moving U on turn 11, direction U.\n\nOn turn 11, from (4,5) move U to (4,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,6), direction U, possible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (4,5) but (4,5) is body? After turn 11, snake positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5) or something.\n\nAfter turn 11 move to (4,6): head (4,6), body to (4,5) (previous head), tail to (5,5) (previous body? Before move turn 11: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (5,4)? Let's trace.\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,5), snake: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5), head to (4,5), body to previous head (5,5), tail to previous body (5,4) — so snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6), head to (4,6), body to previous head (4,5), tail to previous body (5,5) — so snake: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,6), direction U, possible moves: U to (4,7) wall; D to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision; L to (3,6); R to (5,6) but (5,6) wall. So only L to (3,6)\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen on turn 12 move to (3,6), eat if food, but (3,6) has food, so eat, then snake grows.\n\nAfter eat: head (3,6), body (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)  // length 4\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,6), move L to (2,6), no eat, snake: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,6), move D to (2,5), but (2,5) gone, and (2,5) may be wall or free, but no food.\n\n(2,5) is gone, so no eat.\n\nBut I ate (3,6) on turn 12, so I have one food.\n\nNow for (2,5), I missed it because I arrived late.\n\nTo eat (2,5), I need to be at (2,6) by turn 13 at latest.\n\nWith the U move, I reach (2,6) on turn 13.\n\nOn turn 13, I am at (2,6), and I can move D to (2,5) on turn 13 to eat, but on turn 13, (2,5) is available, as life_span=1.\n\nAt turn 13, I am at (2,6), and I move to (2,5), which is food, so I can eat it on turn 13.\n\nYes!\n\nIn turn 13, from (2,6) to (2,5), and (2,5) is food, available on turn 13, so I eat it.\n\nPerfect.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 12: move to (3,6) and eat\n\nTurn 13: move to (2,6)  // from (3,6) to (2,6)\n\nBut on turn 13, I move from (3,6) to (2,6), so at (2,6), no food there.\n\nThen on turn 14, I move to (2,5), but turn 14 (2,5) gone.\n\nNo: on turn 13, I start at (3,6), I move to (2,6). After move, it's turn 13 end, I am at (2,6).\n\n(2,5) is adjacent, but to eat it, I need to move to it on a turn.\n\nSo on turn 14, I move from (2,6) to (2,5), but on turn 14, (2,5) is not available.\n\nBut on turn 13, I am at (2,6) after move, and (2,5) is there, but I don't move to it on turn 13; I moved to (2,6) on turn 13.\n\nThe action on turn 13 is to move to (2,6), so I can only move to (2,5) on turn 14.\n\nBut on turn 14, (2,5) is gone.\n\nHowever, on turn 13, if I could move directly to (2,5) from (3,6), but I can't because not adjacent.\n\nThe only way is to be at (2,6) on turn 12 or turn 13 and move to (2,5) on that turn.\n\nFor example, if on turn 12 I am at (2,6), I can move to (2,5) on turn 12 or 13.\n\nOr on turn 13 at (2,6), move to (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nBut on turn 13, moving to (2,5) is possible only if I am at (2,6) at the start of turn 13.\n\nIn the plan, on turn 13 start, I am at (3,6), not at (2,6).\n\nI am at (2,6) only at the end of turn 13.\n\nSo for turn 13 action, I am at (3,6), moving to (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 14, I am at (2,6), moving to (2,5), but (2,5) gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,5).\n\nTo eat it, I need to reach (2,6) by turn 12.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom turn 9: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4)  // this might be faster to left\n\nThen turn 10: move L to (3,4)  // but (3,4) is free? Yes, not wall\n\nFrom (4,4) move L to (3,4)\n\nThen snake: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (5,4)  // after move, head (3,4), body to (4,4), tail to (5,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 11: from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) wall; D to (3,3); L to (2,4) wall; R to (4,4) body. So only D to (3,3)\n\nMove D to (3,3)\n\nSnake: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 12: from (3,3), move L to (2,3) or D to (3,2) or R to (4,3)\n\nBut to reach (2,6), I am at (3,3), far away.\n\nNot possible by turn 12.\n\nIf from turn 9 move U to (5,5), turn 10 move L to (4,5), turn 11 move U to (4,6), turn 12 move L to (3,6) eat, then on turn 13 I can only move to (2,6), not to (2,5) directly.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (2,5) because of the walls blocking access, and the path is long.\n\nPerhaps (2,5) is not reachable in time from here.\n\nMinimum steps from (5,4) to (2,6) or (1,5), which are entrances to (2,5).\n\n(5,4) to (2,6): difference x-3, y+2, so at least 5 moves, but with obstacles, may be more.\n\nTurn 9 to turn 13 is 5 turns: turn 9,10,11,12,13 actions.\n\nOn turn 13, I can be at (2,6) and move to (2,5), but on turn 13, (2,5) can be eaten, so if I move to (2,5) on turn 13, I eat it.\n\nBut to move to (2,5) on turn 13, I need to be at (2,6) or (1,5) on turn 13.\n\nCan I be at (2,6) on turn 13?\n\nFrom turn 9: move U to (5,5) - turn 9\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,6) and eat\n\nTurn 13: move L to (2,6)  -- on turn 13, I am at (2,6) after move.\n\nBut at the start of turn 13, I am at (3,6), I move to (2,6).\n\nFor turn 13 action, I am moving to (2,6), not to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 14, I move to (2,5), gone.\n\nBut on turn 13, when I am at (2,6) after move, it's the end of turn 13, so (2,5) is still there, but I didn't move to it on turn 13; I moved to (2,6).\n\nTo move to (2,5) on turn 13, I need to be at a cell adjacent to it on turn 13, but at the start of turn 13, I am at (3,6), not adjacent.\n\nSo I cannot move to (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nThe only way is to be at (2,6) on turn 12 or turn 13 and choose to move to (2,5) on that turn.\n\nFor example, on turn 12, if I am at (2,6), I can move to (2,5) on turn 12.\n\nOr on turn 13, if I am at (2,6), I can move to (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nBut in both cases, I need to be at (2,6) at the start of the turn.\n\nOn turn 12, can I be at (2,6)?\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 9:\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,6), I can only move to (3,6), not to (2,6) directly.\n\nSo on turn 12, I am at (3,6) after move.\n\nNot at (2,6).\n\nSo impossible to be at (2,6) before turn 13.\n\nOn turn 13, I can be at (2,6) but then I can move to (2,5) on turn 13 to eat.\n\nOn turn 13, when I am at (2,6), I move to (2,5), and since (2,5) is available on turn 13, I eat it.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the action sequence:\n\nTurn 13: move from current position to (2,6)? No, on turn 13, I start at (3,6), and I move to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 14, I start at (2,6), and I can move to (2,5), but (2,5) is gone.\n\nBut for turn 13, the action is to move to (2,6), not to (2,5).\n\nBut at the moment I move to (2,6) on turn 13, (2,5) is still there, but I don't move to it.\n\nThe food is eaten only if the head moves onto the food cell during the move.\n\nSo on turn 13, when I move from (3,6) to (2,6), I am not on (2,5), so no eat.\n\nThen on turn 14, (2,5) is gone.\n\nSo I miss it.\n\nHowever, since on turn 13, (2,5) is available, and I am at (2,6) after turn 13, I could have moved to it on turn 13, but I didn't because I was at (3,6) at the start.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat (2,5) from this position within the time.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on eating (3,6) and then survive.\n\nBut (2,5) has life_span 5, so if I can reach it faster.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 9, move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 10, move U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11, move U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 12, move L to (3,6) eat\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr from (4,4) turn 10 move L to (3,4), but then stuck.\n\nSo I think I have to accept that (2,5) is not reachable, and only eat (3,6).\n\nThen after that, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut there might be other foods later, but currently only these.\n\nSo for now, let's go with eating (3,6).\n\nAlso, prioritize survival.\n\nWith move U on turn 9, I can eat (3,6) on turn 12.\n\nWith move L on turn 9, I can also reach (4,6) on turn 11, then (3,6) on turn 12.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut with U move, I am closer to row 6.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to think about where to go.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,6) and eat\n\nThen turn 13: move L to (2,6)\n\nThen from there, I can move to (1,6) or (2,5) but (2,5) gone, so move to (1,6) or (1,5), etc.\n\nBut for now, let's output up to turn 13 or so.\n\nSince (2,5) is not eaten, but I have one food.\n\nAnother food is (3,6) eaten.\n\nNow, for the initial choice, both U and L are possible, but U seems better for reaching the food area.\n\nIf I move L on turn 9 to (4,4), then:\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,6) eat\n\nSame as above, but I reached (4,6) on turn 11 instead of turn 11 in both cases.\n\nWith U on turn 9, to (5,5) on 9, (4,5) on 10, (4,6) on 11.\n\nWith L on turn 9, to (4,4) on 9, then to (4,5) on 10, (4,6) on 11, same.\n\nBut with L on turn 9, from (4,4), I could have moved D or L, but U is better to go up.\n\nIn terms of safety, with U move, after moving to (5,5), the body is at (5,4) and (5,3), so (5,5) is head, then to (4,5), etc.\n\nWith L move, head at (4,4), body at (5,4), tail at (5,3), similar.\n\nBut in U move, when I go to (5,5), then to (4,5), the cell (5,5) is occupied by body later, but no immediate risk.\n\nI think U is fine.\n\nSo for turn 9, move U.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: L to (3,6) eat\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,6), move L to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) but no food, or L to (1,6), or U to (2,7) wall, so only L or D.\n\nSay move L to (1,6)\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor the answer, provide 5 turns: turn 9 to 13.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nIn turn 12, when I move L to (3,6), I eat, so it's good.\n\nThen turn 13 move L to (2,6)\n\nNow, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the format.\n\nBut for turn 12, moving L to (3,6) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are valid.\n\nSo I think this is a safe sequence.\n\nIf I move L on turn 9, it's similar but I start left earlier.\n\nBut with U, I avoid the body at (5,3), but when I move U, the tail is at (5,3), and I move away.\n\nWith L, I go to (4,4), which is also safe.\n\nBut let's go with U.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nFor turn 13, I have L to (2,6)\n\nBut I can add turn 14 if needed.\n\nSince the food (2,5) is not eaten, but it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I can try to eat it by going directly, but I think not possible.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Availability**: \n  - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 1 must be eaten on turn 9, but it is unreachable from (5,4) in one move, so it will disappear after turn 9.\n  - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 2 must be eaten on turn 9 or 10, but it is also unreachable due to distance and obstacles, so it will disappear after turn 10.\n  - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 5 can be eaten from turn 9 to 13. However, access is restricted as (2,4) and (3,5) are walls, so it can only be reached from (2,6) or (1,5). Given the current position, reaching (2,5) by turn 13 is not feasible without excessive risk, so it is not targeted.\n  - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 8 can be eaten from turn 9 to 16. It is reachable by turn 12 via a safe path and is prioritized.\n\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is U (up), so D (down) is not allowed due to no instant reverse.\n  - From (5,4), possible moves are U to (5,5) or L to (4,4) (D leads to body collision; R leads to wall).\n  - Moving U on turn 9 positions the snake closer to (3,6) and avoids immediate risks.\n\n- **Path to (3,6)**:\n  - Turn 9: Move U to (5,5) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 10: Move L to (4,5) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 11: Move U to (4,6) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 12: Move L to (3,6) – eat positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 4).\n  - This path is safe, avoids walls and body collisions, and efficiently reaches the food.\n\n- **Beyond Turn 12**:\n  - After eating (3,6) on turn 12, the snake is at [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] with head direction L.\n  - On turn 13, move L to (2,6) – safe, no food, and positions for future exploration.\n  - Survival is prioritized; no negative food or immediate threats.\n\nThis sequence eats one positive food by turn 12 and ensures the snake remains in a viable position for future turns, with the option to explore other areas (e.g., toward (1,6) or (2,6)) for potential new food spawns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: L\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: L\nTurn 13: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 10, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so that's 8x8 cells? Let me clarify.\n\nThe grid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area should be from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly for y. But let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nIt says: Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. That means the valid grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), so a 6x6 grid internally.\n\nAlso, there are internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then (5,4), then (5,3). So the snake is vertical, going up, since head direction is U (up). Head at (5,5), next segment at (5,4), which is below, so yes, moving up means decreasing y? In grid coordinates, typically y increases upwards or downwards?\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). Let's see the definition:\n\nU: (x,y+1) – so if y increases, that might be north or south? I need to define the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, y increasing down, or bottom-left, y increasing up? The movement says:\n\nU (up): (x,y+1) – so if U is up, and it says (x,y+1), that means y+1 is up, so probably y=0 is bottom, and y increases upwards? Or y=0 is top, and y increases downwards?\n\nLet's clarify from the movement definitions:\n\n- U: (x,y+1)  // up, so y+1\n\n- D: (x,y-1)  // down, y-1\n\n- L: (x-1,y)  // left\n\n- R: (x+1,y)  // right\n\nIn standard Cartesian coordinates, if (0,0) is bottom-left, then U would be (x,y+1), meaning y increases up. But in computer graphics, often (0,0) is top-left, with y increasing down.\n\nBut here, since U is (x,y+1) and it's up, I think we should assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases as we go up. That makes sense because moving up increases y.\n\nSimilarly, walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. So y=0 is the bottom wall, y=7 is the top wall.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,5), direction U (up), so moving to higher y? Head direction U means last move was up, so from (5,4) to (5,5), since positions are [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)], so head at (5,5), which was reached by moving up from (5,4), so y increased from 4 to 5? (5,4) to (5,5), so y from 4 to 5, which is an increase, so if y increases upwards, then moving from (5,4) to (5,5) is moving up.\n\nBut in the movement definition, U: (x,y+1), so if we are at (x,y), moving U goes to (x,y+1), so y+1 is one unit up.\n\nSimilarly, D to (x,y-1), down.\n\nSo in this case, snake head at (5,5), came from (5,4), so it was moving up to get there.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (4,1,2,1) – I think this is (x,y, life_span, value). Format says ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but here it's written as (x,y, life_span, value), let's see:\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4,1,2,1) - (2,5,4,1) - (3,6,7,1) - (1,4,10,1)\"\n\nIt says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\", and lists (4,1,2,1), etc. Probably (x,y, life_span, value). Since all values are 1 and life_span given, so:\n\n- Food at (4,1): life_span=2, value=1\n\n- Food at (2,5): life_span=4, value=1\n\n- Food at (3,6): life_span=7, value=1\n\n- Food at (1,4): life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll are positive food, since value=1, and no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 10, for food at (4,1) with life_span=2, it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life_span is the remaining life, I think.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at current turn, life_span is given, so for (4,1), life_span=2, meaning it will disappear after 2 turns, so at turn 12 it will be gone. Countdown: turn 10: life_span=2, after turn 10, it becomes 1, after turn 11, it becomes 0, and disappears before turn 12 or after? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo on turn t, when we see life_span L, it means:\n\n- During turn t, countdown is L\n\n- After turn t, if not eaten, countdown becomes L-1\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? Typically, it might be that at the start of turn, if countdown is 0, it's gone.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume that at the beginning of turn t, food with life_span L has L turns left including this turn. After this turn, if not eaten, it has L-1 left, and when L-1=0 after the turn, it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, it can be eaten during the turn when head moves to it.\n\nFor (4,1): life_span=2 at turn 10. After turn 10, if not eaten, life_span=1 for turn 11. After turn 11, if not eaten, life_span=0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5): life_span=4 at turn 10, so will disappear after turn 13.\n\nTurn 10: L=4, after turn 10: L=3, after turn 11: L=2, after turn 12: L=1, after turn 13: L=0, disappear.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6): L=7 at turn 10, disappears after turn 16.\n\n(1,4): L=10 at turn 10, disappears after turn 19.\n\nAll values +1, so all good to eat.\n\nNow, snake: positions [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)], head at (5,5), direction U, so last move was up to (5,5).\n\nCurrent possible moves: from head (5,5), I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nFirst, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U (up), so opposite is D (down). So I cannot move down immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body, but body collision: head cannot move to a body segment except the tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move to where tail is now, as long as after move, it's not colliding.\n\nStandard snake rules: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by body except the tail, it collides. But if it moves to the tail cell, and tail moves away, it's ok, because the tail was there but moves, so head occupies that cell without collision.\n\nAlso, walls: cannot move to wall cells.\n\nFirst, let's list all wall cells.\n\nBorder: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x. But since playable area is x1-6, y1-6, these are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n\nSo let's list all obstacles:\n\n- (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nNow, snake body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nHead at (5,5), so possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U (up): to (5,5+1) = (5,6)\n\n- D (down): to (5,5-1) = (5,4)\n\n- L (left): to (5-1,5) = (4,5)\n\n- R (right): to (5+1,5) = (6,5)\n\nBut D is opposite to current direction U, so cannot move D. So D is invalid.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nFirst, U to (5,6): is this a wall? (5,6): y=6, which is not y=7, so not border wall. But internal obstacles: (5,6) is in the list? (5,6) is given as internal obstacle? Look: obstacles include (5,6), yes, (5,6) is an internal obstacle. So (5,6) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n\nAlso, is it occupied by body? Body has (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), so (5,6) not body, but it is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) is the second segment of the snake. Moving to (5,4) would cause collision because (5,4) is a body segment, and it's not the tail? Tail is (5,3), so (5,4) is the middle segment. After move, head moves to (5,4), but body segments: the tail will move, but let's see what happens.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell:\n\n- If the cell is a body segment other than the tail, collision occurs immediately.\n\n- If it is the tail cell, and tail moves away, no collision.\n\nHere, (5,4) is not the tail; tail is (5,3). So moving to (5,4) would collide with body.\n\nAlso, D is opposite direction, so already invalid.\n\nL to (4,5): is this wall? (4,5): x=4,y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles list: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). (4,5) not there, so not wall.\n\nBody: snake at (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), so (4,5) not occupied, so valid move.\n\nR to (6,5): (6,5), x=6,y=5. Border: x=6 is not x=0 or x=7, x=7 is wall, x=6 is playable? Border cells: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable, y=1 to y=6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not wall, it's playable.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo (6,5) is playable? x=6, y=5, not border.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,5) not listed, so not obstacle.\n\nBody: not occupied, so valid.\n\nBut (6,5) is not in obstacles, yes.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,5): only L and R are valid, since U is wall, D is invalid and body.\n\nL to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and survival.\n\nAlso, consider food.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (4,1): value 1, life_span 2, so must be eaten by turn 11 at latest, since on turn 10 it has life 2, after turn 10 life 1, after turn 11 life 0 gone. So can be eaten on turn 10 or 11.\n\n- (2,5): life 4, can be eaten up to turn 13\n\n- (3,6): life 7, up to turn 16\n\n- (1,4): life 10, up to turn 19\n\nAll value 1.\n\nSnake length 3, so eating increases length.\n\nNow, head at (5,5), can go to (4,5) or (6,5).\n\nIf I go left to (4,5), then from there, possible moves.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nAlso, need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: let's list coordinates:\n\n(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, which we saw.\n\n(3,5) is obstacle.\n\n(5,2) obstacle.\n\n(1,2) obstacle.\n\nEtc.\n\nSnake at (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nFood at (4,1), (2,5), (3,6), (1,4)\n\n(3,6) is food, but (3,6) has y=6, which is the top row, y=6 is playable, since y=7 is wall.\n\ny=1 to 6 playable, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSimilarly x.\n\n(3,6) is food.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (3,5), which is below (3,6).\n\nNow, life_span: (4,1) must be eaten soon, in next two turns.\n\n(4,1) at y=1, which is bottom row.\n\nFrom head (5,5), to reach (4,1), it's not adjacent, so multiple moves.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nFirst, since (4,1) will disappear soon, I should consider going towards it if possible.\n\nBut with current position, from (5,5), moving L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), so from (4,5) it's closer, but down.\n\nBut moving down might be possible later.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,5), which is at y=5, same row.\n\n(2,5) and head at (5,5), so left.\n\nBut obstacles.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, for turn 10, I need to choose action.\n\nThen think ahead.\n\nPossible actions: L or R.\n\nCase 1: Move L to (4,5) on turn 10.\n\nThen snake positions: head to (4,5), then body: the tail (5,3) will be removed? When snake moves, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten now, so after move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, then (5,4), then (5,3) is tail and removed? Let's see.\n\nInitial positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] head to body to tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5), the new positions: head at (4,5), then the first body segment is the old head (5,5), then the second body segment is (5,4), and the tail (5,3) is left behind, so snake becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] length still 3.\n\nTail was (5,3), which is now empty.\n\nNow, head at (4,5), direction: since moved left, direction now L.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5): cannot move opposite to current direction, which is L, so opposite is R, cannot move right.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU to (4,5+1)=(4,6)\n\nD to (4,5-1)=(4,4)\n\nL to (4-1,5)=(3,5)\n\nBut (3,5) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (3,5), yes, (3,5) is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, walls: (4,6): y=6, not wall, but is it obstacle? Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) not listed, so not obstacle.\n\nBody: snake positions now (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), so (4,6) not body, (4,4) not body.\n\nBut (3,5) is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo from (4,5), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,6)\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nR is invalid because opposite direction.\n\nL to (3,5) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nNow, if I move U to (4,6), then head to (4,6), positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] , tail (5,4) removed? After move: head (4,6), body (4,5), then (5,5), and (5,4) removed. Snake length 3.\n\nDirection now U.\n\nNow, from (4,6), possible moves: cannot D (opposite), so U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,7), but y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,6)\n\nR to (5,6)\n\n(3,6) is food, but let's see if accessible.\n\n(3,6): is it wall? y=6 not border, x=3 not border. Obstacles: not in list, so not wall.\n\nBut there is food at (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\nR to (5,6) is invalid.\n\nL to (3,6) possible.\n\nU invalid.\n\nSo from (4,6), can move L to (3,6) or D, but D is opposite, cannot.\n\nDirection is U, so opposite is D, cannot move D.\n\nSo only L to (3,6).\n\nMove to (3,6), which has food, so eat it, snake grows.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head to (3,6), then body: since food eaten, tail not removed, so snake becomes [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] length 4.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, from (3,6), possible moves: cannot R (opposite), so U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5), but (3,5) is obstacle, wall.\n\nL to (2,6)\n\n(2,6): not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed.\n\nBody not there.\n\nSo possible L to (2,6) or D to (3,5) invalid, so only L to (2,6).\n\nMove to (2,6), no food, positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] tail (5,5) removed? Since no food eaten, tail removed.\n\nAfter move to (2,6), head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), and (4,5) is last? Positions: from previous [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] after moving head to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), then body (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5)? When moving, the segments follow: head new position, then each body segment to previous position.\n\nPrevious positions: head at (3,6), body at (4,6), body at (4,5), body at (5,5) but that was tail.\n\nAfter move: head to (2,6), then the first body segment goes to where head was (3,6), second body to where first body was (4,6), third body to where second body was (4,5), and the tail (5,5) is removed. So new positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]? Let's list:\n\nBefore move: segments: index 0: (3,6) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5) tail? Snake length 4: positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6): head (2,6), body segment 1 moves to previous head position (3,6), body segment 2 moves to previous body position (4,6), body segment 3 moves to previous body position (4,5), and the tail (5,5) is removed. So new positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] and tail is (4,5) now.\n\n(4,5) is the tail.\n\nFrom (2,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: cannot R (opposite), so U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,7) wall invalid.\n\nD to (2,5)\n\nL to (1,6)\n\n(2,5) has food? Food at (2,5), yes.\n\n(2,5) is food location.\n\nAlso, (1,6) not food.\n\nBut (2,5): y=5, x=2.\n\nNow, can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nIf move to (2,5), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is after several moves.\n\nBack to turn 10.\n\nIf on turn 10 I move R instead to (6,5).\n\nFirst, let's see the other option.\n\nFrom (5,5), move R to (6,5) on turn 10.\n\nThen positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (5,4), tail (5,3) removed, so [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: cannot L (opposite), so U, D, R.\n\nR to (7,5) x=7 wall invalid.\n\nU to (6,6)\n\nD to (6,4)\n\n(6,6): y=6, not wall. Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) not listed, so ok.\n\nBody not there.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (6,4), yes, so (6,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) or D, but D to (6,4) invalid, so only U to (6,6).\n\nMove to (6,6), no food there, positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)] , tail (5,4) removed.\n\nDirection U.\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves: cannot D (opposite), so U, L, R.\n\nU to (6,7) wall invalid.\n\nL to (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, wall.\n\nR to (7,6) wall invalid.\n\nAll invalid? L to (5,6) is wall, U and R wall, so no moves? Dead end!\n\nAt (6,6), surrounded: U wall, L to (5,6) wall, R wall, D is opposite and not possible or to (6,5) which is body now? Positions: snake at (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nD to (6,5) is where body is, so collision, cannot move there.\n\nIndeed, no valid moves from (6,6), so if I go to (6,5) and then to (6,6), I die on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving right on turn 10 leads to death on turn 11 or 12.\n\nSpecifically, on turn 10 move R to (6,5), then on turn 11 only move U to (6,6), then on turn 12 no moves, dead.\n\nSo moving right is bad, leads to quick death.\n\nTherefore, I should not move right.\n\nOnly left is viable.\n\nOn turn 10, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen as before.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 11, from (4,5), I can move U or D.\n\nNow, need to think about food, especially (4,1) with short life.\n\n(4,1) must be eaten by turn 11.\n\nTurn 10: life_span 2, after turn 10, if not eaten, life_span 1 for turn 11. After turn 11, if not eaten, gone.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 10 or 11.\n\nBut on turn 10, from (5,5), moving to (4,5) or (6,5), neither is (4,1), so not eaten on turn 10.\n\nSo must be eaten on turn 11 if possible.\n\nNow, on turn 11, head at (4,5), after moving from turn 10.\n\nIf on turn 10 I move L to (4,5), then on turn 11 head at (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) or D to (4,4).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), so to reach it, I need to go down.\n\nBut from (4,5), moving D to (4,4) gets me closer.\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, so from (4,4) to (4,1) is three moves down, but I have only turn 11 to eat it? On turn 11, if I move, I can eat if I move to (4,1), but (4,1) is not adjacent to (4,5); it's down, but not reachable in one move.\n\n(4,5) to (4,4) is one move down, to (4,3) next, etc.\n\nOn turn 11, head at (4,5), (4,1) is at distance |5-1|=4 in y, same x, but with obstacles or not.\n\nCan I reach (4,1) on turn 11? Only if I move directly to it, but from (4,5) to (4,1) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5), but (3,5) wall, (5,5) is body now? After move to (4,5), positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], so (5,5) is body, not free.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can only go to (4,6) or (4,4) or (3,5) invalid or (5,5) body, so only (4,6) or (4,4).\n\nNeither is (4,1), so I cannot eat (4,1) on turn 11 either.\n\nTherefore, (4,1) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 11.\n\nBecause on turn 10 and 11, I cannot reach it.\n\nDistance: from (5,5) to (4,1): delta x=1, delta y=4, min moves 5, but in two turns, I can move at most 2 steps, not enough.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,1) is 4 steps down, need at least 4 turns, but only one turn left (turn 11) for it to be eaten, since after turn 11 it disappears.\n\nSo impossible to eat (4,1). It will be wasted.\n\nSo I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nNow, other foods: (2,5) at (2,5), life 4, so up to turn 13.\n\n(3,6) at (3,6), life 7.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), life 10.\n\nNow, back to turn 10 move L to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 11, from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) or D to (4,4).\n\nIf I move D to (4,4), then head to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] , tail (5,4) removed.\n\nDirection D (since moved down).\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves: cannot U (opposite), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,3)\n\nL to (3,4)\n\nR to (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,3): not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,3) not listed.\n\nBody: positions (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), so (4,3) free.\n\n(3,4): not wall, obstacles include (2,4) but not (3,4), so ok.\n\n(5,4): not wall, but (6,4) is obstacle, not (5,4). (5,4) was body earlier, but now free.\n\nAll seem possible, but need to check.\n\nAlso, food: (2,5) at (2,5), which is close.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), etc.\n\nIf on turn 11 I move U to (4,6), as before, I go to (3,6) and eat food, but let's see the path.\n\nI need to think multiple steps.\n\nSince moving right is suicidal, I must move left on turn 10.\n\nSo turn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nThen for turn 11, I have choice: U or D.\n\nNow, if I move U to (4,6), then as before, I am forced to move to (3,6) on next turn to eat food.\n\nThen from there, only to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid with obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nAlso, snake body: currently (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), but after moves, changes.\n\nFor planning, ignore snake body for now, since it moves.\n\nFree cells: all (x,y) for x=1-6, y=1-6 except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSo free: for example, (1,1), (1,3), (1,4) food, (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5) food, (2,6)\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6) food\n\n(4,1) food short life, (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\n(5,3) snake, (5,4) snake, (5,5) snake, but (5,3) is snake now, but will move.\n\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(6,5) is free? Yes, not obstacle.\n\n(5,3) is snake, not free.\n\nBut for pathing, we can consider.\n\nNow, food at (2,5), (3,6), (1,4)\n\n(4,1) will disappear.\n\nFrom head after turn 10 at (4,5), I can go to (4,6) or (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (4,6), then to (3,6) to eat food on turn 12 if I move sequentially.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)  // turn 10\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)  // no food\n\nThen positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] direction U\n\nTurn 12: from (4,6), can only move L to (3,6) since other moves invalid, as before. Move to (3,6), eat food, snake grows to length 4: positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]? After move: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), and (5,5) since food eaten, tail not removed, so [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] length 4.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, U invalid, so only L to (2,6)\n\nMove to (2,6), no food, positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] tail (5,5) removed? No food, so tail removed: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5) — positions [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,6), can move L to (1,6) or D to (2,5) which has food.\n\nIf move D to (2,5), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nOr L to (1,6), no food.\n\nBut (2,5) is food, so better to eat.\n\nSo move D to (2,5), eat, positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail not removed, so [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]? After move: head to (2,5), body segments to previous positions: first body to (2,6), second to (3,6), third to (4,6), and fourth to (4,5), but since food eaten, no removal, so positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] length 5.\n\nDirection D (since moved down).\n\nNow, from here, I can explore more.\n\nBut (1,4) food is available.\n\nBack to choice on turn 11.\n\nIf from (4,5) on turn 11, I move D to (4,4) instead.\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] direction D.\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,4), can move D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nNow, (2,5) food is at (2,5), so I can go towards it.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4), then to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle? (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\n(2,4) is wall, so from (3,4) cannot go to (2,4).\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move L to (3,4), then head to (3,4), positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5)] direction L.\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,4), possible moves: cannot R, so U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (3,3)\n\nL to (2,4) obstacle invalid.\n\nSo only D to (3,3)\n\nMove to (3,3), no food, positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4)] tail (4,5) removed? After move: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), and (4,5) removed.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen I can go down or other.\n\nBut (2,5) is above, at (2,5), which is not far, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,3), can move to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) might be hard to reach soon.\n\n(2,5) has life 4, at turn 10, so by turn 13.\n\nTurn 10: L=4, after turn 10 L=3, after 11 L=2, after 12 L=1, after 13 L=0 gone. So must eat by turn 13.\n\nOn turn 13, if I am at (3,3), (2,5) is at (2,5), which is distance |3-2|=1 x, |3-5|=2 y, so min 3 moves, but on turn 13 I need to be there, but from (3,3) on turn 13, I can move to (2,3), (3,4) but (3,4) is body or not, or (4,3), etc., not directly to (2,5).\n\nTo reach (2,5) on turn 13, I need to be adjacent on turn 12.\n\nBut on turn 12, if I was at (4,4), I could have moved to (3,4) or other.\n\nLet's see if I can reach (2,5) by turn 13.\n\nFrom turn 10: head at (4,5) after move.\n\nTurn 11: move from (4,5) to say (3,4)? But from (4,5), I can only go to (4,6) or (4,4), not directly to (3,4) because no diagonal, and L to (3,5) is wall.\n\nSo on turn 11, only (4,6) or (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (4,4) on turn 11.\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) — (3,4) is free, not obstacle.\n\nMove to (3,4), positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5)] direction L.\n\nNow, (2,5) is adjacent: (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, (3,4) is x=3,y=4, so adjacent cells: (3,5) obstacle, (3,3), (2,4) obstacle, (4,4) body, so not directly adjacent to (2,5). Distance: |3-2|=1, |4-5|=1, but cells not adjacent due to obstacles or position.\n\n(3,4) to (2,5) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). (2,4) obstacle, (3,5) obstacle, (4,4) body, (3,3) free.\n\nSo to reach (2,5), I need to go to (2,5) from another cell.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (3,3) or, since only D to (3,3) or U invalid, L invalid, so only to (3,3) on turn 12? Turn 12: from (3,4) move to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 13, from (3,3), can move to (3,2), (2,3), (4,3), etc., but (2,5) is at y=5, I am at y=3, so not reachable in one move. Min two moves, but on turn 13 I need to be at (2,5) to eat before it disappears.\n\nBut after turn 13, it disappears, so last chance turn 13.\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 13, I can move to (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), or (4,3), none is (2,5), and (2,5) not adjacent, so I cannot eat it on turn 13.\n\nTherefore, if I go down to (4,4) on turn 11, I may not reach (2,5) in time.\n\nIf on turn 11 I go up to (4,6), then I can reach (3,6) on turn 12 and eat that food, then on turn 13 I can be at (2,6), and from there move to (2,5) on turn 13 to eat (2,5) before it disappears.\n\nTurn 13: from (2,6) move D to (2,5), eat.\n\nAs in the first path.\n\nAnd (2,5) can be eaten on turn 13, which is before it disappears.\n\nTurn 10: L=4 for (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 10: L=3\n\nAfter turn 11: L=2\n\nAfter turn 12: L=1\n\nAfter turn 13: L=0, disappears, so must be eaten on or before turn 13.\n\nOn turn 13, if I eat it, it's ok.\n\nIn the up path: turn 12 eat (3,6), turn 13 eat (2,5).\n\nBoth eaten.\n\nThen I can go to other food.\n\nIf I go down on turn 11, I might miss (2,5).\n\nAlso, (3,6) has longer life, but I can eat it early.\n\nMoreover, in the down path, I might not get food soon.\n\nSo better to go up on turn 11.\n\nTherefore, for turn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 12: move L to (3,6) and eat food.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? Think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions.\n\nThe answer format is to output for turns starting from t1, for several turns.\n\nBut how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output in the format with actions.\n\nProbably I need to specify actions for a sequence of turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I might output for say 5 turns.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI have up to turn 12 planned.\n\nTurn 13: from (3,6) after eating, head at (3,6), direction L, then move to (2,6) or other, but only (2,6) possible, as before.\n\nThen turn 13: from (2,6) move D to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen after that, positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) as before, direction D.\n\nNow, from (2,5), possible moves: cannot U (opposite), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (1,5)\n\nR to (3,5) obstacle invalid.\n\nSo only L to (1,5)\n\nMove to (1,5), no food, positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] tail (4,5) removed? After move: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and (4,5) removed since no food.\n\nSnake length 4 now? After eating (2,5), length was 5, then move to (1,5) no food, so tail removed, length 4: positions [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]? Let's track:\n\nAfter eating (2,5) on turn 13: positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] head (2,5)\n\nThen turn 13 move: to (1,5), no food, so head to (1,5), body to (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) removed. So positions [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] length 4.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, from (1,5), possible moves: cannot R (opposite), so U, D, L.\n\nU to (1,6)\n\nD to (1,4) which has food? (1,4) is food location.\n\nL to (0,5) x=0 wall invalid.\n\nSo U to (1,6) or D to (1,4)\n\nIf move D to (1,4), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nOr U to (1,6), no food.\n\nBetter to eat.\n\nSo move D to (1,4) on turn 14.\n\nThen positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) and since food eaten, tail not removed, so [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] length 5.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for now, I have a plan.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,6) but I ate it earlier.\n\nAll foods are covered.\n\nNow for the actions.\n\nStart from turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,6)  // eat food\n\nTurn 13: from (3,6), after eating, direction L, move to (2,6)  // as only choice, but let's confirm.\n\nFrom (3,6) after turn 12 move, positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 12: head moved to (3,6), positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] since food eaten.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 13: move to (2,6), no food, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), and (5,5) removed? No, since no food eaten, tail (5,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nThen from (2,6), move to (2,5) to eat.\n\nIn positions above, after move to (2,6), tail is (4,5), but (2,5) is adjacent down.\n\nMove D to (2,5).\n\nThen as before.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: L  // eat (3,6)\n\nTurn 13: from (3,6) to (2,6), which is L, but direction: after moving L to (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 13: move to (2,6)? Turn 13 action: move from current head to (2,6), but after turn 12, head is at (3,6), move to (2,6), so action L.\n\nThen positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 14: move from (2,6) to (2,5), action D.\n\nEat (2,5).\n\nThen turn 15: from (2,5) to (1,5)? Earlier I said to (1,5), but from (2,5) after eating, positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] head (2,5)\n\nThen move to (1,5), action L.\n\nThen turn 16: from (1,5) to (1,4), action D, eat (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) has long life, no rush.\n\nI could output actions for several turns.\n\nSince the prompt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output in the boxed format with actions.\n\nProbably for a sequence, say 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's list from turn 10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 11: U (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 12: L (to (3,6), eat)\n\nNow, for turn 13, from (3,6) move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: from (2,6) move D to (2,5), eat\n\nThen turn 15: from (2,5) move L to (1,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut in the sequence above, turn 13: move L to (2,6)\n\nBut after turn 12, head at (3,6), and (2,6) is free, not body, etc.\n\nThen turn 14: D to (2,5)\n\nNow, I have 5 actions: turn 10 to 14.\n\nTurn 15 would be next.\n\nBut for answer, I think outputting 5 turns is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 13, when I move to (2,6), no issue.\n\nBut (2,5) is eaten on turn 14.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, moving R is bad, so L is only choice.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nThen for turn 13, move L to (2,6)\n\nBut direction: after turn 12, head at (3,6), direction L, so moving L to (2,6) is fine.\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,6), direction L, can move D to (2,5), which is not opposite, since opposite would be R, but D is down, so ok.\n\nThen move D.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nTurn 13: L  // to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: D  // to (2,5) and eat\n\nI could include turn 15.\n\nBut 5 actions might be sufficient.\n\nSince think 5+ turns, output 5 actions.\n\nNow, to confirm, no immediate risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but in this case, no food under tail, I think.\n\nFor example, at some point, but in this path, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 10 Decision\n\n**Current State (Turn 10):**\n- **Grid**: 6x6 playable area (x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6) with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)].\n- **Snake**: Head at (5,5), body at [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)], current direction U (up). Length 3.\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,1): value +1, life_span=2 (disappears after turn 11).\n  - (2,5): value +1, life_span=4 (disappears after turn 13).\n  - (3,6): value +1, life_span=7 (disappears after turn 16).\n  - (1,4): value +1, life_span=10 (disappears after turn 19).\n- **Constraints**: Cannot move opposite to current direction (U), so down (D) is invalid. Must avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\n**Immediate Moves from (5,5):**\n- **U (to (5,6))**: Invalid, as (5,6) is an internal obstacle.\n- **D (to (5,4))**: Invalid, as it is opposite to current direction U and (5,4) is a body segment (not tail).\n- **L (to (4,5))**: Valid, no wall or body.\n- **R (to (6,5))**: Valid, no wall or body.\n\nMoving right (R) to (6,5) leads to a dead end:\n- Turn 11: Only valid move is U to (6,6).\n- Turn 12: No valid moves from (6,6) (surrounded by walls and obstacles), causing death.\n\nThus, moving right is high-risk and must be avoided. Moving left (L) to (4,5) is the only viable option for survival and sets up access to food.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival. Prioritize eating (2,5) and (3,6) soon, as (4,1) is unreachable before it disappears (requires 4+ moves from (5,5); (1,4) has long life).\n- **Path to Food**:\n  - **Turn 10: Move L to (4,5)** - Positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)].\n  - **Turn 11: Move U to (4,6)** - Positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]; direction U. Avoids dead ends and moves toward (3,6).\n  - **Turn 12: Move L to (3,6)** - Eat food (value +1); positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]; length 4; direction L.\n  - **Turn 13: Move L to (2,6)** - Positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]; direction L.\n  - **Turn 14: Move D to (2,5)** - Eat food (value +1); positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]; length 5; direction D.\n- **Outcome by Turn 14**: Score increases by 2 (from eating (3,6) and (2,5)), snake length 5. Survivable path with options to reach (1,4) later.\n\n**Risk Avoidance**:\n- No collisions or wall hits in the sequence.\n- (4,1) is ignored as unreachable (disappears after turn 11).\n- Tail reward danger not triggered (no food under tail).\n\n**Actions for Turns 10-14 (5 turns):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 11: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 12: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 13: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 14: D (down)\n}",

        "score": 2,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 11, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be from (0,0) to (7,7), since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There are also internal obstacles at specific points: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). I should list them out for clarity.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). That's eight points.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,5), then (5,5), and tail at (5,4). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (1,4) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food mentioned here. Value is +1 for all.\n\nNow, since head direction is L (left), that means from the previous position, it moved left to (4,5). The snake positions are [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]. So from turn 10 to 11, head was at (5,5) and moved left to (4,5), with body following to (5,5) and (5,4)? Let's see the positions: before moving, head was at (5,5), it moved left to (4,5), so the new head is (4,5), previous head (5,5) becomes body, and tail was (5,4) but since it moved, the tail should have moved from (5,4) to... positions are listed as [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], but (5,4) is the tail, and it didn't move yet? I think I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard Snake: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail end is left.\n\nAt turn 11, positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (5,4). So on turn 11, after moving, head is at (4,5), which came from moving left from (5,5). Then (5,5) was the previous head, now body, and (5,4) was the previous body, now tail.\n\nNow, for the next move, I need to choose a direction: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current head direction is L, so I cannot move right (R) on this turn, because that would be instant reverse. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left again).\n\nNow, let's map the grid. I should sketch a grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders and internal obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo, occupied cells:\n\n- Snake: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\n- Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n- Food: (4,1), (2,5), (3,6), (1,4)\n\nFood at (4,1), (2,5), (3,6), (1,4), all with value 1.\n\nNow, head at (4,5). Current direction L, so from (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- Left (L): to (3,5)\n\n- Up (U): to (4,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,4)\n\nCannot go right to (5,5) because that's the body, and also it would be reverse, but (5,5) is occupied by body, so invalid anyway.\n\nNow, check each possible move:\n\n1. Left to (3,5): what is at (3,5)? (3,5) is an internal obstacle! From the list: internal obstacles include (3,5). So (3,5) is a wall, cannot move there. Deadly collision.\n\nSo moving left to (3,5) is invalid, hits a wall.\n\n2. Up to (4,6): (4,6) - is this occupied? Snake is at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), so (4,6) is free? But check walls: borders, y=7 is wall, but (4,6) is not border, y=6 <7. Internal obstacles: (5,6) is an obstacle, but (4,6) is not listed, so should be free. Food? Food at (3,6), not (4,6). So (4,6) should be empty and safe to move to.\n\n3. Down to (4,4): (4,4) - not border, not in internal obstacles? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (2,4), etc., not (4,4). Snake not there, food not there, so should be safe.\n\nFood is at (4,1), (2,5), (3,6), (1,4), not (4,4).\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,6) or D to (4,4). L is blocked by wall, R is not possible due to direction and also occupied.\n\nR would be to (5,5), which is body, so invalid anyway.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (4,1) has life span 1, meaning after this turn (turn 11), it will disappear if not eaten. Since it's turn 11, and life span 1, it was probably spawned recently, and will vanish after turn 11 if not eaten on turn 11.\n\nFood life span: it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nFor food at (4,1), life span 1, so on turn 11, if not eaten, it disappears after this turn. So to eat it, I must move to (4,1) on turn 11.\n\nBut head is at (4,5), and (4,1) is four cells down. I can't reach it in one turn. So impossible to eat (4,1) on turn 11; it will disappear after this turn. So I should ignore it, as it's not reachable.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,5) life span 3, so disappears after turn 13 if not eaten? Let's see.\n\nLife span: when it says life span N, it means it will disappear after N turns from now, including current turn.\n\nFor example, food with life span 1: present on turn t, disappears after turn t (so not available on turn t+1).\n\nLife span 2: present on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, life span 3: present on turn t, t+1, t+2, disappears after turn t+2.\n\nHere, turn t=11.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,1): life span 1, so present only on turn 11, disappears after turn 11.\n\n- (2,5): life span 3, present on turns 11,12,13, disappears after turn 13.\n\n- (3,6): life span 6, present on turns 11,12,13,14,15,16, disappears after turn 16.\n\n- (1,4): life span 9, present on turns 11 to 19, disappears after turn 19.\n\nSince (4,1) can't be reached this turn, it will disappear, so no point considering it.\n\nNow, head at (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) or D to (4,4).\n\nI need to think multiple steps ahead.\n\nAlso, the snake has length 3, so after eating food, it grows by one segment, so next position the tail doesn't move, effectively.\n\nBut for movement, when it eats, the tail stays, so the body grows.\n\nBut for collision, need to be careful, especially with tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate moving up to (4,6).\n\nIf I move U to (4,6):\n\n- New head position: (4,6)\n\n- Body: previous head (4,5) becomes body, and previous body (5,5) becomes the new tail? Positions: after move, head to (4,6), then body segments: (4,5) and (5,5), but tail was (5,4), which moves to where? When head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position.\n\nCurrent positions: [head: (4,5), body1: (5,5), body2/tail: (5,4)]\n\nAfter move U: head moves to (4,6), then body1 moves to (4,5), body2 moves to (5,5). So new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nTail is at (5,5).\n\nNow, (4,6) is not food, food is at (3,6), which is nearby.\n\nFood at (3,6), which has life span 6, so available for a while.\n\nNow, from (4,6), possible directions: since I moved up, head direction now U, so I can move U, L, R, but not D (down, opposite).\n\nNow, from (4,6):\n\n- U to (4,7): but y=7 is border wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- L to (3,6): (3,6) has food! Value +1.\n\n- R to (5,6): but (5,6) is an internal obstacle! From list, (5,6) is wall, so invalid.\n\n- D to (4,5): but that's the body position now, and also it would be reverse, so invalid.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6), the body is at (4,5) and (5,5).\n\nSo from (4,6):\n\n- U: (4,7) is wall, invalid\n\n- L: (3,6) - is it occupied? Snake: (4,5) and (5,5), not (3,6). Obstacles: (3,5) is obstacle, but (3,6) is not listed as obstacle. Food at (3,6), so it should be free to move to.\n\n- R: (5,6) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (4,5) is body, invalid and reverse direction not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,6) is L to (3,6).\n\nIf I move to (4,6) on turn 11, then on turn 12, I must move to (3,6) to eat the food there.\n\nNow, if I eat (3,6), since it's positive food, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nNew positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]  // head, body, body (tail is (5,5))\n\nNow turn 12: move L to (3,6)\n\nSince (3,6) has food, we eat it. So head moves to (3,6), and since food, the tail doesn't move, so body segments: previous head (4,6) becomes body, previous body (4,5) becomes body, and tail (5,5) stays, but since we eat, we add a new segment, so positions: head at (3,6), then body: (4,6), (4,5), and tail (5,5) remains. So new positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nSnake length now 4.\n\nHead at (3,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, from (3,6), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,7): y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D to (3,5): (3,5) is internal obstacle! Wall, invalid\n\n- L to (2,6): let's see, (2,6) - not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, not (2,6). Food? Food at (2,5), not (2,6). So (2,6) should be free.\n\n- R to (4,6): but (4,6) is body, invalid.\n\nAlso, direction: head direction is L, so cannot move R (right) instantly.\n\nCurrent direction L, so can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nBut U and D are invalid, so only L to (2,6).\n\nMove L to (2,6).\n\nNo food there, so tail moves.\n\nAfter moving: head to (2,6), body to (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) moves to where? When no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nPositions before move: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter move L to (2,6): head to (2,6), then body: (3,6) moves to head's previous position? Standard: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo head moves to (2,6), then body1 (which was at (3,6)) moves to where head was, but head was at (3,6), so it stays? No.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Head was at (3,6), moves to (2,6)\n\n- Body segment 1 (at (4,6)) moves to where head was, which is (3,6)\n\n- Body segment 2 (at (4,5)) moves to where body1 was, which is (4,6)\n\n- Tail (at (5,5)) moves to where body2 was, which is (4,5)\n\nBut since we ate food last turn, the tail didn't move then, but this turn no food, so tail moves.\n\nAfter eating on turn 12, positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] with (5,5) as tail.\n\nNow turn 13: move to (2,6), no food.\n\nSo:\n\n- Head to (2,6)\n\n- Body1 (was at (4,6)? Positions: index 0: head (3,6), index 1: body (4,6), index 2: body (4,5), index 3: tail (5,5)\n\nWhen head moves to (2,6), then:\n\n- Segment 1 (index 1) moves to previous position of segment 0, which was (3,6)\n\n- Segment 2 (index 2) moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (4,6)\n\n- Segment 3 (index 3) moves to previous position of segment 2, which was (4,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nNow head at (2,6), direction L (since moved left from (3,6)).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (2,7): y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D to (2,5): (2,5) has food! Value +1, life span 3, so still available? Turn 13, food (2,5) life span 3, present on 11,12,13, so on turn 13 it can be eaten.\n\n- L to (1,6): possible? (1,6) not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, not (1,6). So free.\n\n- R to (3,6): but (3,6) is now body, invalid.\n\nAlso, direction L, so cannot move R instantly.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\n(2,5) has food, so if I move D, I eat it.\n\nBut I need to check for tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, before moving, head at (2,6), tail at (4,5). Are they adjacent? (2,6) and (4,5): difference in x is 2, y is 1, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(2,6) neighbors: (2,5), (2,7), (1,6), (3,6). (4,5) is not adjacent to (2,6); it's two away.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head to (2,5), body segments: previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) stays, plus growth, so new tail at (4,5)? When eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), body (3,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nBut tail is at (4,5), which is where it was, but now we have an extra segment.\n\nAfter growth, the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the positions are: head new, then all previous positions including the tail.\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] with (4,5) as tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5) and eating: head (2,5), then body: (2,6) (previous head), (3,6) (previous body), (4,6) (previous body), and the tail (4,5) remains, so positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nNow, head at (2,5), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: since moved down, can move D, L, R, not U.\n\n- D to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle! Wall, invalid\n\n- L to (1,5): possible? (1,5) not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is, not (1,5). Food at (1,4), not (1,5). So free.\n\n- R to (3,5): (3,5) is obstacle, invalid.\n\n- U to (2,6): but (2,6) is body, invalid and reverse.\n\nSo only L to (1,5).\n\nMove to (1,5), no food there.\n\nThen positions: head to (1,5), body to (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail from (4,5) moves to (4,6)? Tail was at (4,5), moves to previous position of the last body segment.\n\nPositions before: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (1,5) no food: head to (1,5), body1 to (2,5), body2 to (2,6), body3 to (3,6), tail to (4,6) (since last body was at (4,6))\n\nSo [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead at (1,5), direction L (left).\n\nAnd so on. But I'm getting ahead; this is one possible path if I go up first.\n\nBut I have another choice: down to (4,4) on turn 11.\n\nLet's evaluate that first.\n\nBack to turn 11, head at (4,5), move D to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is free, no food.\n\nNew positions: head to (4,4), body to (4,5), tail to (5,5)? Current positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nAfter move D: head to (4,4), body to (4,5), body to (5,5) (since tail moves from (5,4) to (5,5)? )\n\nHead to (4,4), then body1 (was at (4,5)) moves to where head was? Head was at (4,5), so body1 moves to (4,5)? Confusion.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (4,5), index 1: body (5,5), index 2: tail (5,4)\n\nAfter move down to (4,4):\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 1 (index 1) moves to previous position of segment 0, which was (4,5)\n\n- Segment 2 (index 2) moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (5,5)\n\nSo new positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nHead at (4,4), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: can move D, L, R, not U (up, reverse).\n\n- D to (4,3): possible? (4,3) not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: none at (4,3), so free.\n\n- L to (3,4): possible? (3,4) not listed obstacle, but internal obstacles include (3,5), (2,4), etc., not (3,4). (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) is not. So free.\n\n- R to (5,4): (5,4) was tail, but now it's free? In positions, (5,5) is body, (5,4) is not occupied now? Previous tail moved to (5,5), so (5,4) is empty.\n\nIs (5,4) an obstacle? No, not listed. Food? No. So free.\n\nBut (5,4) might be near obstacles, but not itself obstacle.\n\nNow, from (4,4), I can go D, L, or R.\n\nR to (5,4): but (5,4) is not occupied, but let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, food available: (2,5) at (2,5), life span 3, so can be eaten on turns 11,12,13.\n\n(3,6) at (3,6), life span 6.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), life span 9.\n\nNow, if I go down to (4,4), I can then move towards (2,5) or other food.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), which is close to (4,4)? (4,4) to (2,5) is not adjacent; x diff 2, y diff 1.\n\nI need to think which food to target.\n\nAlso, survival: the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells to see free space.\n\nGrid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: borders all around.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSnake: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — but when I move, it changes.\n\nFor now, turn 11.\n\nFree cells except walls and snake and food.\n\nFood is on cells, so those are not free for movement, but can be eaten.\n\nBut for pathfinding, I can move to food cells to eat.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nIf I go up to (4,6), as I thought earlier, I am forced to go to (3,6) to eat, then to (2,6), then I can eat (2,5) if I go down, but then from (2,5), I can only go left to (1,5), then from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4) to eat food there, or left to (0,4) but x=0 wall, so down to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) has food with life span 9, so available.\n\nBut let's see the position after eating (2,5): from (2,5), after eating, positions include (4,5) and (4,6), etc., but at that point, the area might be crowded.\n\nIn the up path, when I go to (2,5), I have body at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), tail at (4,5), so the cells around might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), I moved to (1,5), then to (1,4) to eat.\n\nBut (1,4) is food, so eating it.\n\nThen snake grows longer.\n\nBut I need to think if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger.\n\nIn this path, when I ate (2,5), head was at (2,5), tail at (4,5), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, eating (1,4), head at (1,4), tail at that time would be somewhere else.\n\nBut let's not simulate too far yet.\n\nNow, the down path: from (4,5) move D to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4), I have options.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nThen from (3,4), head direction L if I move left.\n\nThen I can go to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,5): but (3,5) obstacle, invalid\n\n- D to (3,3): possible? (3,3) not border, not obstacle, free.\n\n- L to (2,4): obstacle, invalid\n\n- R to (4,4): body or previous, but after moving, let's see.\n\nFirst, from (4,4) move L to (3,4).\n\nAssume turn 11: move D to (4,4)\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) no food, so positions: head to (3,4), body to (4,4), tail to (4,5) (since last body was (4,5), tail moves there)\n\nSo [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nHead at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (3,5): obstacle, invalid\n\n- D to (3,3): free\n\n- L to (2,4): obstacle, invalid\n\n- R to (4,4): body, invalid\n\nSo only D to (3,3).\n\nMove to (3,3), no food.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (3,3), can move D, L, R, not U.\n\n- D to (3,2): possible? (3,2) not obstacle, but internal obstacles include (5,2), not (3,2). Also (1,2) is obstacle, but different. So (3,2) free.\n\n- L to (2,3): free\n\n- R to (4,3): free\n\n- U to (3,4): body, invalid\n\nSo I can go various ways.\n\nBut food is at (2,5), (3,6), etc.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, x=2, so from (3,3), I need to go up and left, but up to (3,4) is invalid, since body or obstacle? From (3,3), (3,4) is body, so I can't go up directly.\n\nI have to go left or down or right.\n\n(2,5) life span 3, present on turns 11,12,13.\n\nTurn 11: not eaten\n\nTurn 12: if I can reach, but from above, on turn 12, I am at (3,4) or (3,3), not close to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is near obstacles.\n\nTo reach (2,5) from current, I need to go via (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, or from (2,6) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so only from (1,5) or (3,5) blocked, so from (2,6) or (2,4) blocked, (2,4) wall, (2,6) might be accessible.\n\nFrom the up path, I could reach (2,5) by turn 13.\n\nIn down path, from (3,3), I can go to (2,3), then to (2,2) or (1,3), but (2,5) is above, and (2,4) wall, so I can't reach (2,5) directly because (2,4) blocks the column.\n\n(2,5) has neighbors: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5).\n\n(2,4) is wall, (3,5) is wall, so only accessible from (2,6) or (1,5).\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, (1,5) at x=1,y=5.\n\nSo from the down path, I am at (3,3) on turn 12, I can go to (2,3), then (2,2) or (1,3), but to get to (1,5), I need to go up, but from (2,3) I can go U to (2,4) but wall, invalid, so I can only go L to (1,3) or D to (2,2), etc. Then from (1,3), I can go U to (1,4) which has food, or to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, so U to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) has food with life span 9, so I can eat that later.\n\nBut (2,5) might not be reachable from this path because of the walls.\n\nSimilarly, from up path, I can eat both (3,6) and (2,5).\n\nNow, comparing the two choices on turn 11:\n\n- Move U to (4,6): then I can eat (3,6) on next turn, and (2,5) on turn 13, and then go to (1,4) to eat that food later.\n\n- Move D to (4,4): then I might not be able to eat (2,5) because it expires soon and I'm far, but I can eat (1,4) later.\n\nBut (2,5) life span 3, disappears after turn 13, so if I don't eat by turn 13, it's gone.\n\nIn down path, on turn 11 I'm at (4,4), turn 12 at (3,4) or if I go other way, but to reach (2,5) by turn 13, I need to be adjacent on turn 12 or 13.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 11, if I move R to (5,4), for example.\n\n(5,4) is free? Earlier, from (4,4), move R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4): not obstacle, not snake now.\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), body to (4,4), tail to (4,5)  // [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (5,4), can move U, D, R, not L (reverse).\n\n- U to (5,5): but (5,5) is body, invalid\n\n- D to (5,3): possible? (5,3) not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- R to (6,4): (6,4) is internal obstacle! Wall, invalid\n\n- L to (4,4): body, invalid\n\nSo only D to (5,3).\n\nMove to (5,3), no food.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (4,4)\n\nThen from (5,3), direction D.\n\nCan move D, L, R, not U.\n\n- D to (5,2): (5,2) is obstacle! Invalid\n\n- L to (4,3): free\n\n- R to (6,3): possible? (6,3) not obstacle, but x=6, internal obstacles (6,1), (6,4), not (6,3). So free.\n\n- U to (5,4): body, invalid\n\nSo move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is near border, and obstacles.\n\nNot close to food.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), I'm at (5,3), far away.\n\nBy turn 13, I can't reach (2,5) from down or right moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4) if I go left to (3,4), then to (3,3), even farther.\n\nSo only the up path allows me to eat both (3,6) and (2,5) quickly.\n\n(3,6) I can eat on turn 12, and (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nThen (1,4) I can eat later.\n\nIn the up path, after eating (2,5) on turn 13, I go to (1,5) on turn 14, then to (1,4) on turn 15 to eat that.\n\n(1,4) life span 9, so on turn 15 it's still available (turns 11 to 19).\n\nNow, in that path, is there any risk?\n\nWhen I eat (1,4), head at (1,4), what is the tail?\n\nBut before that, let's confirm the sequence with turns.\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,6) eat food, snake grows to length 4\n\nPositions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]  // tail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 13: move to (2,6) no food? Earlier I said to (2,6), but from (3,6) to (2,6) is left, no food.\n\nThen positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\n(2,5) is below, so on turn 13, from (2,6), I move D to (2,5) to eat.\n\n(2,5) has food, so eat.\n\nPositions after: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5) remains, so [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nLength 5.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 14: move L to (1,5) no food\n\nPositions: head to (1,5), body to (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail to (4,6)  // [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead at (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 15: move D to (1,4) to eat food (1,4)\n\n(1,4) has food, so eat, grow to length 6.\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6) remains? Before move: positions [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] tail (4,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,4) and eat: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and tail (4,6) stays, so [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nNow, head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (1,3), L to (0,4) but x=0 wall, invalid, R to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid, U to (1,5) body, invalid.\n\n(1,5) is body, so U invalid.\n\nD to (1,3): possible? (1,3) not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so free.\n\nSo I can move D to (1,3).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut at (1,4), after eating, I can only go down to (1,3), since other directions blocked.\n\nNow, what about the tail? Tail is at (4,6), far away.\n\nBut I need to consider if I can survive long-term.\n\nAfter going to (1,3), I can go to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, or to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut the point is, in this path, I can eat three foods quickly: (3,6), (2,5), and (1,4) by turn 15.\n\nIf I go down on turn 11, I might only eat (1,4) later, but miss (2,5) and (3,6)? (3,6) life span 6, so I can eat it later, but in down path, I might not be able to reach it easily.\n\nFor example, from down path, I am at (4,4) or lower, and (3,6) is at y=6, so I need to go up, but with obstacles.\n\nBut (3,6) can be eaten until turn 16.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) until turn 19.\n\nBut (2,5) expires after turn 13, so if I don't eat it by turn 13, I lose it.\n\nIn the up path, I eat it on turn 13.\n\nIn down path, I probably can't reach it in time.\n\nTherefore, moving up on turn 11 is better to capture the expiring food.\n\nMoreover, long-term survival: after eating those, I have a longer snake, and I need to find space.\n\nBut for now, maximizing score by eating available food.\n\nAlso, in the up path, I eat three foods in five turns.\n\nTurn 11: move to (4,6), no eat\n\nTurn 12: eat (3,6)\n\nTurn 13: eat (2,5)\n\nTurn 14: move to (1,5), no eat\n\nTurn 15: eat (1,4)\n\nSo three foods by turn 15.\n\nIf I go down, on turn 11 move to (4,4), no eat, then I might go to (1,4) directly or something, but (1,4) is at (1,4), from (4,4) I can go left, but obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) move L to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then L to (2,3), then L to (1,3), then U to (1,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 11: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: D to (3,3)  // cannot reach (2,5) because blocked\n\nTurn 14: L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 15: L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 16: U to (1,4) eat\n\nBut (2,5) is missed, and (3,6) not eaten yet.\n\n(3,6) can be eaten later, but I need to go there.\n\nWhereas in up path, I eat (3,6) early.\n\nAlso, in down path, I eat only (1,4) by turn 16, missing (2,5).\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nMoreover, in up path, after eating (1,4), I am at (1,4), can go down to (1,3), then I have space to move.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), I can go to (1,2) but obstacle, or to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,3) I can go D to (1,2) invalid, or L to (0,3) wall, or R to (2,3), or U to (1,4) but body.\n\nSo only R to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), etc.\n\nBut long-term, I can survive.\n\nNow, back to turn 11, only U and D possible, and U seems better.\n\nBut is there any immediate danger?\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but in this case, when eating, the tail is not adjacent, so safe.\n\nFor example, when I eat (3,6), head at (3,6), tail at (5,5), not adjacent.\n\nEat (2,5), head at (2,5), tail at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nEat (1,4), head at (1,4), tail at (4,6), not adjacent.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, on turn 11, I should move up.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns, but the question is to output actions starting from turn 11.\n\nThe output should be like:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen for future turns, I need to specify, but since it's a plan, I should think ahead.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", and output the actions for the turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 11.\n\nBut I need to specify for turn 11, 12, etc., but since the state changes, I might need to plan the sequence.\n\nIn this case, from above, I can outline the plan.\n\nSince after turn 11, the state changes, but for now, I can define the actions based on the plan.\n\nPerhaps for turn 11, move U, then as above.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother point: in the food, all are positive, no negative, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food under body: currently, no food under snake, I think.\n\nSnake at (4,5),(5,5),(5,4), food at (4,1) etc., not under.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for turn 11, move U to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 12, move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nThen turn 13, from (3,6) to (2,6), but (2,6) no food, but I need to go to (2,5) to eat, but from (2,6) I can go down to (2,5).\n\nIn positions, after turn 12, head at (3,6), with body (4,6),(4,5),(5,5)\n\nThen turn 13, I move to (2,6), which is left, no food, so positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 14, move D to (2,5) to eat? (2,5) is below (2,6), so down.\n\nBut in my earlier, I moved directly to (2,5) on turn 13 from (3,6)? No, from (3,6) to (2,5) is not adjacent; (3,6) to (2,5) is diagonal, not allowed. Moves are only up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go to (2,6) or (3,5) or (3,7) etc., but (3,5) obstacle, (3,7) wall, so only (2,6) or (4,6) body.\n\nSo must go to (2,6) first.\n\nThen from (2,6), go to (2,5) down.\n\n(2,5) is food, so on turn 14 eat.\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nTurn 11: U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 12: L to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 13: L to (2,6)  // since only choice, but no eat\n\nTurn 14: D to (2,5) eat\n\nThen turn 15: from (2,5) to (1,5) left, no eat\n\nTurn 16: D to (1,4) eat? (1,4) is down from (1,5)? (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n\nBut (1,4) has food, so eat on turn 16.\n\nEarlier I said turn 15, but with the extra move to (2,6).\n\nTurn sequence:\n\n- Turn 11: move U to (4,6), no eat\n\n- Turn 12: move L to (3,6), eat, grow to len 4\n\n- Turn 13: move L to (2,6), no eat, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\n- Turn 14: move D to (2,5), eat, grow to len 5, positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5) stays? After eat: head (2,5), body (2,6) (prev head), (3,6) (prev body), (4,6) (prev body), tail (4,5) remains, so [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\n- Turn 15: move L to (1,5), no eat, positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail to (4,6)  // [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\n- Turn 16: move D to (1,4), eat, grow to len 6, positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6) stays? Before move: tail at (4,6), after eat: head (1,4), body (1,5) (prev head), (2,5) (prev body), (2,6) (prev body), (3,6) (prev body), tail (4,6) remains, so [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen turn 17: from (1,4), move D to (1,3), as only choice.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide actions for turn 11 onwards, but since the state changes, I should output the actions I plan, but for future turns, it might depend, but in this case, it seems determined for a few turns.\n\nSince the question says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output the sequence starting from turn 11.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nLet me output for turns 11 to 15 or 16.\n\nBut turn 15 is L to (1,5), turn 16 D to (1,4).\n\nSince all actions are determined in this plan, I can list them.\n\nTo be safe, I should consider if there is a better way.\n\nAnother option: on turn 11, move down to (4,4), but as I thought, I miss (2,5), and (3,6) might be harder to reach.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), I could go up to (4,5) but body, invalid, or to (4,6) but I was at (4,5), moved down, so (4,6) might be free later, but not immediately.\n\nNo, from (4,4), I can only go to other directions.\n\nBut (3,6) is at (3,6), which can be reached via (3,4) but (3,4) to (3,5) obstacle, so not directly, must go to (3,6) from left or right or below, but below (3,5) obstacle, so from (2,6) or (4,6) or (3,7) invalid.\n\n(4,6) might be available, but with snake body, later.\n\nIn down path, it takes more turns to reach food.\n\nWhereas up path gets food faster.\n\nTherefore, moving up is better.\n\nSo for turn 11, action U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as per plan.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to write the sequence.\n\nSince the output should include multiple turns, let's say for 5 turns: turn 11 to 15.\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nTurn 13: L (to (2,6))\n\nTurn 14: D (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 15: L (to (1,5))\n\nAnd then turn 16: D to (1,4), but I can include up to turn 15 or 16.\n\nThe current turn is t1=11, and I need to think ahead, but output from turn 11.\n\nIn the plan, after turn 15, I move to (1,5), then turn 16 to (1,4).\n\nBut for the answer, I can list as many as I think, but perhaps 5 actions.\n\nSince the state might change with new food, but here no new food mentioned, so assume only these foods.\n\nSo I think U is the best for turn 11.\n\nBut in the initial, when I move U to (4,6), is there any risk?\n\n(4,6) is free, and then to (3,6) which has food.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,1) is expiring, but unreachable, so ignore.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (4,1) has a life span of 1 and will disappear after turn 11, but it is unreachable in one move from (4,5). Thus, it is ignored.\n  - (2,5) has a life span of 3 and must be eaten by turn 13 to avoid loss.\n  - (3,6) has a life span of 6 and can be eaten later, but targeting it early allows more flexibility.\n  - (1,4) has a life span of 9 and can be eaten later without immediate risk.\n\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is left (L), so instant reverse to right (R) is not allowed on turn 11.\n  - From (4,5), moving left (L) to (3,5) is blocked by an internal obstacle. Thus, only up (U) or down (D) are possible on turn 11.\n  - Moving up (U) to (4,6) enables eating (3,6) on turn 12 and (2,5) by turn 14, maximizing early food consumption. Moving down (D) to (4,4) risks missing (2,5) due to obstacles and path constraints.\n\n- **Path Analysis**:\n  - **U-path (recommended)**: \n    - Turn 11: Move U to (4,6) – positions become [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)].\n    - Turn 12: Move L to (3,6) to eat food – snake grows to length 4, positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)].\n    - Turn 13: Move L to (2,6) – positions [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)].\n    - Turn 14: Move D to (2,5) to eat food – snake grows to length 5, positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)].\n    - Turn 15: Move L to (1,5) – positions [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)].\n    - This path eats two food items ( (3,6) and (2,5) ) by turn 14 and sets up for eating (1,4) on turn 16, with no collision risks (tail is never adjacent when eating).\n  - **D-path (inferior)**:\n    - Moving D on turn 11 leads to (4,4), but obstacles block access to (2,5) by turn 13, causing it to expire. Eating (3,6) or (1,4) requires more turns, reducing early score potential and increasing risk in cluttered areas.\n\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - The U-path ensures the snake grows early (length 5 by turn 14), providing more flexibility for future moves. After turn 15, the snake can safely move to (1,4) on turn 16 (D from (1,5)) to eat the third food, then navigate south or east to open areas (e.g., (1,3) or (2,3)) to avoid dead ends. The grid has sufficient space for continued survival after eating available food.\n\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No tail reward danger: When eating (3,6), (2,5), or (1,4), the head is not adjacent to the tail.\n  - Wall and body collisions are avoided in the planned path.\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 11-15)**:\n- Turn 11: U (up) to (4,6) – avoids missing expiring food and sets up for high-score sequence.\n- Turn 12: L (left) to (3,6) – eats (3,6), increasing score and length.\n- Turn 13: L (left) to (2,6) – necessary step to reach (2,5).\n- Turn 14: D (down) to (2,5) – eats (2,5) before it expires.\n- Turn 15: L (left) to (1,5) – prepares to eat (1,4) on turn 16.\n\nThis sequence eats two food items by turn 14 and positions the snake to eat the third by turn 16, maximizing score with minimal risk. Beyond turn 15, the snake should continue to (1,4) for the third food and then explore open cells for survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: L \\\\\nTurn 13: L \\\\\nTurn 14: D \\\\\nTurn 15: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 12. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,6), then (4,5), then (5,5). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is U, meaning up, so it's moving towards increasing y. Since it's at (4,6) and direction is U, it came from below, probably from (4,5) in the previous move.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,5) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,6) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,4) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span is how many turns left, including the current turn, so they disappear after that many turns.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 0 to 7 in both x and y.\n\nWalls: borders are walls, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSnake: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nFood: (2,5), (3,6), (1,4)\n\nNow, current head position: (4,6), direction U (up, so y+1). But since it's at y=6, moving up would go to y=7, which is a wall border. y=7 is a wall, so moving up from (4,6) to (4,7) is impossible because that's out of bounds and a wall.\n\nThe head direction is U, but it can't move up because that's a wall. I need to choose a different direction.\n\nThe snake must move to an adjacent cell: up, down, left, right, but not into walls or its body, except possibly the tail if it moves away.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6):\n\n- Up (U): to (4,7) — but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down (D): to (4,5) — but (4,5) is occupied by the body segment. Since the body will move, I need to see if it's safe.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves first, then the body follows. So if the head moves to a cell, that cell must be free except for the tail, which will move away.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nThe snake moves: head goes to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten.\n\nBut for collision, head cannot collide with any body segment except that it can move to the current tail position because the tail will move.\n\nSpecifically: if the head moves to the cell that was the tail, and the tail moves away, then no collision.\n\nOtherwise, if head moves to any other body cell, collision.\n\nAlso, walls are always collision.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,7) — wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (4,5) — currently occupied by body segment at index 1. The positions are [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)], so (4,5) is the second segment.\n\nIf head moves down to (4,5), that cell is occupied by the body, and since the body will not have moved yet, it would be collision, right?\n\nThe movement happens simultaneously in a sense, but typically in Snake, the head moves to new cell, then body shifts.\n\nBut for collision check: if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the tail, it's collision. If it's the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (4,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (5,5).\n\nSo moving to (4,5) would collide with the body segment there.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells.\n\n- L: left, to (3,6)\n\n- R: right, to (5,6)\n\n- D: down, to (4,5) — occupied, not tail, so invalid? But let's confirm.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,6), segment1 (4,5), segment2 (5,5)\n\nIf head moves down to (4,5), which is segment1. After move, head is at (4,5), then segment1 moves to where head was, (4,6), but segment1 was at (4,5), which is now occupied by head? Conflict.\n\nStandard way: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is free or is the tail, it's ok. If it's any other body part, collision.\n\nHere, (4,5) is a body part, not tail, so moving to (4,5) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (5,5) is the tail, so that might be ok if the tail moves.\n\nBut let's list all possible moves.\n\nAvailable adjacent cells:\n\n- North: (4,7) — wall, invalid\n\n- South: (4,5) — occupied by body (segment1), not tail, so invalid\n\n- West: (3,6) — let's check if wall or obstacle.\n\n(3,6) is not a border wall? Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (3,6) is within, x=3 between 0-7, y=6 between 0-7, not border.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(5,6) is an internal obstacle? Let's see: (5,6) is listed, yes.\n\n(5,6) is an obstacle.\n\nBut (3,6) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free, except for food or something.\n\n(3,6) has food? Food positions: (2,5), (3,6), (1,4) — (3,6) is one of the food positions.\n\nBut for movement, we care about whether the cell is accessible, not about food yet.\n\nFirst, is (3,6) a wall or obstacle?\n\nBorders: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so (3,6) is not border wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is an obstacle, but (3,6) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) has food, but that doesn't block movement; you can move to it to eat.\n\nSimilarly, east: (5,6) — (5,6) is listed as internal obstacle, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\n(5,6) is in internal obstacles, so yes, wall.\n\nNow, down to (4,5) is occupied by body, not tail, so invalid.\n\nUp to (4,7) wall.\n\nSo only possible move is west to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is free? Not occupied by body or wall.\n\nBody positions: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) — so (3,6) not among them.\n\nWalls: borders and internal, (5,6) is internal obstacle, but (3,6) is not.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (3,6).\n\nBut is that right? What about down? Down to (4,5) is body, but let's confirm the tail.\n\nThe tail is at (5,5), not (4,5), so (4,5) is a body segment that will not move away immediately; it will only move if the head moves, but since it's not tail, it stays as body.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on.\n\nSo if head moves to (3,6), then the new positions: head at (3,6), then segment1 moves to old head (4,6), segment2 moves to old segment1 (4,5), and tail at (5,5) is removed since no food eaten? Or if food eaten, new segment added.\n\nBut for the move itself, to move to (3,6), it must be that (3,6) is not a wall and not occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail.\n\nHere, (3,6) is not tail, and not occupied, so it's safe.\n\nIf head moved to (4,5), that cell is occupied by segment1, which is not tail, so when head moves there, it collides with the body before the shift, I think.\n\nTypically, in Snake, the collision is checked after the head moves but before the body shifts, so if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail and only if the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (4,5) is segment1, not tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, if head moved to (5,5), which is tail, then it might be ok if the tail moves.\n\nBut (5,5) is adjacent? From (4,6) to (5,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are same x or same y, differing by 1.\n\n(4,6) to (5,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, so not possible. Only up, down, left, right.\n\nSo from (4,6), adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,7) up: wall\n\n- (4,5) down: occupied by body, not tail\n\n- (3,6) left: free, no wall, no body\n\n- (5,6) right: obstacle, wall\n\nSo only possible move is left to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) has food, which is positive, so eating it would increase length.\n\nBut let's see the life span: (3,6) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns, including this turn, so if not eaten now, it might be gone later.\n\nBut since we have to move, and only choice is to (3,6), so for turn 12, action must be L (left).\n\nBut head direction is given as U, but we can change direction, as long as not instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is U, but since we can't move U, we must choose another direction.\n\nMoving left is not reverse; reverse would be down, since U is up, down would be opposite.\n\nBut moving left or right is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse means that if current direction is U, we cannot move D on the next turn, because that would be immediate reverse.\n\nBut here, since we can't move U anyway, moving L or R is fine.\n\nIn this case, only L is possible.\n\nSo for turn 12, action should be L.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nI should list all cells.\n\nLet me make a simple grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAdditionally, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(5,6) is listed, which is at x=5,y=6.\n\nNow, snake: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFood: (2,5), (3,6), (1,4)\n\nAt (4,6), head.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (4,7): y=7, border wall, invalid\n\n- (4,5): occupied by snake body at (4,5), which is not tail; tail is at (5,5), so moving here would collide with body.\n\n- (3,6): not wall, not obstacle, not snake body, so free.\n\n- (5,6): (5,6) is internal obstacle, so wall, invalid.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is to (3,6).\n\nSo for turn 12, action must be L.\n\nNow, after moving to (3,6), we eat the food there, since (3,6) has food. Value +1, so snake grows.\n\nNew snake positions: head at (3,6), then new segment added, so body: old head becomes first body, so positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the tail, so tail was at (5,5), but after move, the segment that was tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nAfter head moves to (3,6):\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Segment1: moves to old head position (4,6)\n\n- Segment2: moves to old segment1 position (4,5)\n\nBut since food is eaten at (3,6), we add a new segment at the end, so the tail doesn't move away; instead, we add a new segment where the tail was, so the snake grows.\n\nStandard Snake growth: when food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,6), then segment1 at (4,6), segment2 at (4,5), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the previous tail position, which was (5,5), so now snake is [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nPositions: index 0: head (3,6), index 1: (4,6), index 2: (4,5), index 3: (5,5)\n\nNow, the head is at (3,6), and we just moved left, so direction is now L (left).\n\nNow, for turn 13, we need to choose next move.\n\nBut we have to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life spans: each turn, life span decreases by 1.\n\nCurrent turn 12, food:\n\n- (2,5): life span 3, so after turn 12, it will have 2 left, then 1, then gone after turn 14? Let's see.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 12, life span given: (2,5) has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns from now, so after turn 12, 13, 14, it will be gone at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) was eaten at turn 12, so it's gone.\n\n(1,4) has life span 8, so it will last until turn 19.\n\nAfter turn 12, food left:\n\n- (2,5): life span now 2 (since turn 12 passed, but we are at turn 13 now? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter turn 12 action, we are now at the state for turn 13.\n\nTurn 12: we moved to (3,6) and ate food.\n\nNow, at the start of turn 13, the state is:\n\nSnake: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] head at (3,6), direction L (since last move was left).\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,5): life span was 3 at turn 12, decreased by 1 for turn 12, so now at turn 13, life span 2\n\n- (1,4): life span was 8, decreased by 1, now 7\n\n- (3,6) was eaten, gone.\n\nAlso, no new food spawned, I assume? The problem doesn't say anything about new food spawning; we only have the given food, and they disappear when life span reaches 0.\n\nSo food: only (2,5) and (1,4) left, with life span 2 and 7 respectively.\n\nNow, for turn 13, head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,6)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- North: (3,7) — y=7, border wall, invalid\n\n- South: (3,5) — (3,5) is internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (3,5), yes, listed, so wall, invalid\n\n- West: (2,6) — not border, not in obstacles? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5) — (2,6) not listed, so free.\n\n- East: (4,6) — but (4,6) is occupied by segment1 of snake. Segment1 is at (4,6), which is not tail; tail is at (5,5).\n\nMoving to (4,6) would be to a body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nAlso, (4,6) is not adjacent? From (3,6) to (4,6) is east, yes adjacent.\n\nBut occupied.\n\nNow, south is invalid, north invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: west to (2,6) or east to (4,6) but east is occupied, invalid.\n\n(2,6) is free? Let's confirm.\n\n(2,6): x=2, y=6, not border (borders are x=0,7 y=0,7), not internal obstacle (listed are (2,4) but not (2,6)), so free.\n\nAlso, not occupied by snake; snake at (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), so (2,6) free.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is west to (2,6).\n\nNo food there, so just move.\n\nAction: L? West is left, which is decreasing x.\n\nCurrent direction is L (left), moving west is continuing left, so not reverse.\n\nReverse would be east, but east is invalid anyway.\n\nSo for turn 13, action W or L (left).\n\nAfter move to (2,6), no food, so snake moves: head to (2,6), body: segment1 to (3,6), segment2 to (4,6), segment3 to (4,5), tail (5,5) removed? Since no food, tail moves away.\n\nPositions: head at (2,6), then segment1 at old head (3,6), segment2 at old segment1 (4,6), segment3 at old segment2 (4,5), and tail was (5,5), but since no food, it is removed, so the last segment is at (4,5), but segment3 is at (4,5), so snake now: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]? Let's list:\n\nAfter head moves to (2,6):\n\n- Head: (2,6)\n\n- Segment1 (first body): moves to old head position (3,6)\n\n- Segment2 (second body): moves to old segment1 position (4,6)\n\n- Segment3 (third body): moves to old segment2 position (4,5)\n\nOld positions: head (3,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (5,5)\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head new: (2,6)\n\n- Seg1 new: old head (3,6)\n\n- Seg2 new: old seg1 (4,6)\n\n- Seg3 new: old seg2 (4,5)\n\nAnd old seg3 (5,5) is removed since no food eaten.\n\nSo snake: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead at (2,6), direction still L (left).\n\nNow turn 14.\n\nFood: (2,5) life span now 1 (since decreased to 2 at turn 13, now turn 14, so 1 left? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 12 start: (2,5) life span 3\n\nAfter turn 12, decreased to 2 at turn 13 start.\n\nTurn 13: decreased to 1 at turn 14 start.\n\nTurn 14: if not eaten, decreases to 0 and disappears at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) life span was 8 at turn 12, decreased to 7 at turn 13, 6 at turn 14.\n\nNow head at (2,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- North: (2,7) — y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- South: (2,5) — (2,5) has food? But let's see if accessible.\n\n(2,5): is it wall or obstacle? Not border, internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so free.\n\nBut snake body? Positions: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) — not at (2,5), so free.\n\n- West: (1,6) — not border, not obstacle? Obstacles include (1,2) but not (1,6), so free.\n\n- East: (3,6) — but (3,6) is occupied by segment1 of snake. Segment1 at (3,6), not tail.\n\nMoving to (3,6) would collide with body.\n\nSouth to (2,5) is free, but let's see if it's safe.\n\n(2,5) is below (2,6), so south.\n\nCurrent direction is L (left), moving south is perpendicular, not reverse.\n\nReverse would be right, east.\n\nPossible moves: south to (2,5) or west to (1,6)\n\nEast to (3,6) invalid.\n\nNorth invalid.\n\nSo we can go south or west.\n\nNow, (2,5) has food with life span 1, so if we eat it now, we get +1 and grow.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a danger if we are adjacent to tail and eat food on tail cell, but tail is not at (2,5).\n\nTail is at (4,5), head at (2,6), not adjacent.\n\n(2,6) and (4,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (2,6) adjacent to (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7) but (2,7) invalid.\n\n(3,6) is occupied, so not free.\n\nSo to (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nIf we go to (2,5), we eat the food, grow.\n\nIf we go to (1,6), no food.\n\nBut (2,5) life span 1, so if not eaten now, it disappears after this turn.\n\nAt turn 14, if we don't eat it, after turn 14, life span decreases to 0 and it disappears, so gone.\n\nSo we should eat it if possible.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, if we move south to (2,5):\n\nThen head to (2,5), eat food, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,5), then body: seg1 to old head (2,6), seg2 to old seg1 (3,6), seg3 to old seg2 (4,6), and add new segment at old tail (4,5), so snake: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nNow, head at (2,5), direction S (south).\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle? (2,4) is an obstacle, but we're at (2,5), not there.\n\nFor future moves.\n\nIf we don't eat and go west to (1,6):\n\nThen head to (1,6), no food, so snake moves: head (1,6), seg1 to (2,6), seg2 to (3,6), seg3 to (4,6), tail (4,5) removed, so snake: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] and (4,5) gone.\n\nThen (2,5) disappears after turn 14, so no food there.\n\nBut we missed the food, which is bad for score.\n\nSince all food is positive, we should eat when possible, as long as safe.\n\nIs it safe to go to (2,5)?\n\nAfter moving, head at (2,5), and body at (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible next moves.\n\nBut we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (2,5) for turn 14.\n\nAction for turn 14: S (south)\n\nThen state for turn 15.\n\nSnake: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] head at (2,5), direction S.\n\nFood: (2,5) eaten, gone. (1,4) life span now 5? At turn 14 start, life span of (1,4) was 6 (after decrease from turn 13: at turn 13 start, life span 7 for (1,4), after turn 13, decreased to 6 at turn 14 start. Then after turn 14, decreased to 5 at turn 15 start? Let's systematize.\n\nLife span decrease at the end of each turn, I assume, or before the next turn.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns have passed.\n\nAt turn t, food has life_span L, it means it will disappear after L turns, so after turn t+L-1 it is gone? Example.\n\nSuppose at turn t, life_span N.\n\nThen after turn t (including current), it decreases by 1, so at turn t+1, life_span N-1.\n\nIf life_span becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (2,5) at turn 12: life_span 3\n\nTurn 12: after turn, life_span 2 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: after turn, life_span 1 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: if not eaten, after turn 14, life_span 0, disappears, so not present at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) at turn 12: life_span 8\n\nTurn 12: after, life_span 7 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: after, life_span 6 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: after, life_span 5 at turn 15\n\nBack to turn 14 decision.\n\nAt turn 14, head at (2,6), we can go S to (2,5) or W to (1,6)\n\nIf go S to (2,5), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nThen turn 15: head at (2,5), direction S.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- North: (2,6) — but (2,6) is occupied by body segment (first body segment). Is it the tail?\n\nSnake positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nTail is at (4,5)\n\n(2,6) is segment1, not tail.\n\nSo moving north to (2,6) would collide with body.\n\n- South: (2,4) — (2,4) is internal obstacle? Yes, (2,4) is in the list, so wall, invalid.\n\n- West: (1,5) — not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) but not (1,5), so free.\n\n- East: (3,5) — (3,5) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: only west to (1,5)\n\nSince north to body, south wall, east wall.\n\nSo must move west to (1,5)\n\nNo food there, I think.\n\n(1,4) has food, but (1,5) is different.\n\nSo move to (1,5), no eat.\n\nThen snake moves: head to (1,5), body: seg1 to (2,5), seg2 to (2,6), seg3 to (3,6), seg4 to (4,6), tail (4,5) removed? Since no food eaten.\n\nOld positions: head (2,5), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (1,5):\n\n- Head: (1,5)\n\n- Seg1: to old head (2,5)\n\n- Seg2: to old seg1 (2,6)\n\n- Seg3: to old seg2 (3,6)\n\n- Seg4: to old seg3 (4,6)\n\nAnd old seg4 (4,5) removed.\n\nSo snake: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]? Let's list:\n\nPositions: head (1,5), then seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (4,6)\n\nHead direction now W (west).\n\nNow turn 16.\n\nFood: (1,4) at (1,4), life span at turn 15 start was 5, after turn 15, decreased to 4 at turn 16 start.\n\n(1,4) is adjacent to (1,5), since (1,5) south is (1,4).\n\nFrom head (1,5), we can move south to (1,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (1,5):\n\n- North: (1,6) — not wall, not obstacle, free? Earlier at turn 14, (1,6) was free, but now snake body? Positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — (1,6) not occupied, so free.\n\n- South: (1,4) — has food, and free? Not wall, not obstacle, not body.\n\n- West: (0,5) — x=0 border wall, invalid\n\n- East: (2,5) — but (2,5) is occupied by seg1, which is not tail. Tail is at (4,6).\n\nSo moving east to (2,5) invalid.\n\nThus possible moves: north to (1,6) or south to (1,4)\n\nIf we move south to (1,4), eat food, grow.\n\nThen snake grows: head to (1,4), add new segment at tail, so positions: head (1,4), seg1 to old head (1,5), seg2 to old seg1 (2,5), seg3 to old seg2 (2,6), seg4 to old seg3 (3,6), and add new segment at old tail (4,6), so snake: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nNow head at (1,4), direction S.\n\nBut (1,4) is a corner? Let's see future moves.\n\nFirst, back to turn 14 alternative.\n\nAt turn 14, instead of going south, we could go west to (1,6).\n\nIf at turn 14, from (2,6), we go west to (1,6), no eat.\n\nThen snake: head to (1,6), seg1 to (2,6), seg2 to (3,6), seg3 to (4,6), tail (4,5) removed, so snake: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead direction W.\n\nThen (2,5) disappears, gone.\n\nFood only (1,4) with life span 5 at turn 15 start.\n\nTurn 15: head at (1,6), direction W.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- North: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- South: (1,5) — free? Not wall, not obstacle, not body.\n\n- West: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- East: (2,6) — occupied by seg1, invalid\n\nSo only move south to (1,5)\n\nNo food, move.\n\nSnake: head (1,5), seg1 to (1,6), seg2 to (2,6), seg3 to (3,6), tail (4,6) removed? No food, so tail moves away.\n\nOld positions: head (1,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (4,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,5):\n\n- Head: (1,5)\n\n- Seg1: to old head (1,6)\n\n- Seg2: to old seg1 (2,6)\n\n- Seg3: to old seg2 (3,6)\n\nOld seg3 (4,6) removed.\n\nSnake: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nThen turn 16: head at (1,5), direction S (south).\n\nNow food (1,4) at (1,4), life span at turn 16 start: was 5 at turn 15 start, after turn 15 decreased to 4 at turn 16 start.\n\nFrom (1,5), can move south to (1,4) to eat.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nAs before, north to (1,6) occupied, east to (2,5) free? (2,5) not body now, snake at (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), so (2,5) free.\n\nWest invalid, south to (1,4).\n\nSo can go south to (1,4) or east to (2,5)\n\nIf go south to (1,4), eat food, grow.\n\nSnake: head (1,4), then body: seg1 to (1,5), seg2 to (1,6), seg3 to (2,6), and add new segment at old tail (3,6), so [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nNow, head at (1,4), which is near corner.\n\nPossible moves from (1,4):\n\n- North: (1,5) — occupied by seg1, not tail, invalid\n\n- South: (1,3) — but y=3, not border, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,2) is wall, but (1,3) is not listed, so free? Assuming not wall.\n\n(1,3) should be free.\n\n- West: (0,4) x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- East: (2,4) — (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is south to (1,3)\n\nThen move there, no food probably.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we are getting stuck in the corner.\n\nIn the first path, when we ate (2,5) at turn 14, then at turn 15 we had to go to (1,5), then at turn 16 to (1,4) if we choose, but after eating (1,4), we are at (1,4) with only south move possible to (1,3).\n\nFrom (1,3), we can go south to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nOr east to (2,3), if free.\n\n(2,3) not wall, not obstacle, so possible.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nBack to turn 14 decision.\n\nAt turn 14, if we go to (2,5) and eat, we get +1, but then we end up in a position where we have to move to (1,5) and then to (1,4), eating another +1, but then stuck at (1,4) with only south to (1,3), and from there, we can go east or south, but south to (1,2) wall, so only east to (2,3), then we can explore.\n\nBut we might have space.\n\nIf at turn 14 we go west to (1,6) instead, we miss the (2,5) food, but we can still get to (1,4) later.\n\nIn that case, at turn 16, we can eat (1,4) from (1,5), but after eating, head at (1,4) with same problem.\n\nIn both cases, after eating (1,4), we are stuck with head at (1,4), only south to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is free, then from (1,3), we can go east to (2,3) or south to (1,2) but (1,2) wall, so only east to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) should be free.\n\nThen from (2,3), we can go north to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or south to (2,2), or east to (3,3), west to (1,3) but (1,3) is body after move, etc.\n\nBut we have obstacles, so the grid has limited space.\n\nPerhaps we should avoid going to the corner if possible.\n\nBut at turn 14, we have to choose.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 14, if we don't eat (2,5), it disappears, and we only have (1,4) left, which we can eat later.\n\nBut by eating (2,5), we get an extra point.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver in the corner.\n\nLet's see the grid size and obstacles.\n\nList all free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps for long-term survival, we should keep the snake shorter or avoid tight spaces.\n\nBut we need to maximize score, so eat when possible.\n\nBut in this case, since (2,5) will disappear soon, we should eat it if we can.\n\nAt turn 14, from (2,6), if we go to (2,5), we eat it, grow to 5 segments.\n\nThen at turn 15, we must go to (1,5), no eat.\n\nThen at turn 16, from (1,5), we can go to (1,4) to eat or to (2,5) but (2,5) is now occupied? At turn 16, from (1,5), positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) or something.\n\nAfter turn 15, we are at (1,5), with snake [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] if we didn't eat at turn 16 yet.\n\nAt turn 16, head at (1,5), food (1,4) below.\n\nIf we go south to (1,4), we eat, grow to 6 segments.\n\nThen head at (1,4), with body at (1,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nThen only move south to (1,3), as before.\n\nThen from (1,3), to (2,3), etc.\n\nIf at turn 16, from (1,5), we don't go south, but go east to (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied by seg1 at that point, so we cannot move there; it's body.\n\nAt turn 16, from (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- North: (1,6) — may be free or not. In this state, snake at (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), so (1,6) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\n- South: (1,4) free\n\n- East: (2,5) occupied by seg1, invalid\n\n- West: invalid\n\nSo we can go north to (1,6) or south to (1,4).\n\nIf we go north to (1,6), no food, then we miss (1,4) for now, but it has life span, at turn 16 start, life span 4, so we can eat later.\n\nBut (1,4) is at (1,4), and we are at (1,6), so we can go down later.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, since we need to plan 5 turns ahead from turn 12, but we are at turn 14 now.\n\nStart from turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: only move L to (3,6), eat food, score +1.\n\nTurn 13: only move L to (2,6), no eat.\n\nNow turn 14: we have choice, S to (2,5) or W to (1,6)\n\nIf we go S to (2,5), eat, score +1, then turn 15 must go W to (1,5), no eat.\n\nThen turn 16: from (1,5), we can go S to (1,4) to eat or N to (1,6)\n\nIf we go S to (1,4), eat, score +1, then turn 17 must go S to (1,3), no food, then turn 18 from (1,3) to (2,3) or other, but let's see.\n\nSince we need to output actions for multiple turns, probably from turn 12 to turn 16 or 17.\n\nThe answer format is for turns starting from t1, so turn 12,13,14,etc.\n\nBut how many turns to output? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should include actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps output as many as we can or until a point.\n\nSince the state might change, we can output for the next few turns.\n\nBut to be safe, let's plan 5 turns: from turn 12 to 16 or 17.\n\nTurn 12: action L\n\nTurn 13: action L (to (2,6))\n\nNow turn 14: if we go S, action D\n\nThen turn 15: from (2,5) to (1,5), action L (west)\n\nThen turn 16: from (1,5) to (1,4), action D (south) to eat\n\nThen turn 17: from (1,4) to (1,3), action D (south)\n\nThen turn 18: from (1,3) to (2,3), action R (east), etc.\n\nBut we don't have to output all, just for a few turns.\n\nThe answer should be for the current turn and next.\n\nBut it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so we need to specify for several turns.\n\nSince at turn 14 we have a choice, we need to decide based on long-term.\n\nBut in this case, if we go W at turn 14 to (1,6), then turn 15 to (1,5), turn 16 to (1,4) to eat, then same as above.\n\nBut we miss the (2,5) food.\n\nSo for score, it's better to eat (2,5) since it will disappear.\n\nMoreover, after eating, we have more segments, but we can still move.\n\nThere is a risk with tail reward danger, but here no food on tail, so ok.\n\nSo I think it's better to eat (2,5) at turn 14.\n\nSo for turn 14, action S.\n\nThen turn 15, action W to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 16, we can go S to (1,4) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 16, from (1,5), we have choice to go S or N.\n\nIf we go S, we eat (1,4), but then we are at (1,4) with only move to (1,3), which might be risky if the snake is long.\n\nSince (1,4) has life span 7 at turn 12, at turn 16 it has life span 4 left, so we can eat it later.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, from (1,5), we can go north to (1,6) instead, to avoid the corner temporarily.\n\nThen from (1,6), we can go to other places.\n\nBut (1,6) is at top, and we have walls.\n\nFrom (1,6), at turn 16, if we go there.\n\nLet's list the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo for example, from (1,6), we can go south to (1,5), or east to (2,6), but (2,6) may be occupied.\n\nAt turn 16, if we are at (1,5), and we go north to (1,6), then snake moves.\n\nAssume we are at turn 14: we go S to (2,5), eat.\n\nTurn 15: go W to (1,5), no eat.\n\nNow at turn 16, head at (1,5), direction W (since last move west).\n\nPossible moves: N to (1,6), S to (1,4), E to (2,5) invalid, W invalid.\n\nIf we go N to (1,6), no food.\n\nThen snake: head to (1,6), seg1 to (1,5), seg2 to (2,5), seg3 to (2,6), seg4 to (3,6), tail (4,6) removed, so snake: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead direction N.\n\nThen turn 17: from (1,6), possible moves: N to (1,7) wall, S to (1,5) occupied by seg1, invalid, W invalid, E to (2,6) occupied by seg4? Positions: head (1,6), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (3,6)\n\n(2,6) is seg3, not tail, so moving east to (2,6) invalid.\n\nNo valid moves? Only south to (1,5) but occupied, or north wall, west wall, east occupied.\n\nStuck! Collision if move.\n\nAt turn 17, from (1,6), no possible moves, all directions invalid.\n\nNorth wall, south to (1,5) body, east to (2,6) body, west wall.\n\nSo death.\n\nTherefore, if at turn 16 we go north to (1,6), we die at turn 17.\n\nBut if at turn 16 we go south to (1,4), we eat food, then to (1,3), etc.\n\nSo we must go south to (1,4) at turn 16 to avoid that.\n\nThen after eating (1,4), head at (1,4), only move south to (1,3).\n\nTurn 17: move to (1,3), no food.\n\nSnake: head to (1,3), seg1 to (1,4), seg2 to (1,5), etc., depending on positions.\n\nAfter eating at (1,4), snake has 6 segments: head (1,4), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (4,6) or something.\n\nPositions before move: at turn 16 start, snake [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead at (1,5), move south to (1,4), eat food.\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), seg1 to old head (1,5), seg2 to old seg1 (2,5), seg3 to old seg2 (2,6), seg4 to old seg3 (3,6), and add new segment at old tail (4,6), so [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead at (1,4), direction S.\n\nTurn 17: only move south to (1,3)\n\n(1,3) not wall, not obstacle, free.\n\nMove to (1,3), no food.\n\nSnake moves: head to (1,3), seg1 to (1,4), seg2 to (1,5), seg3 to (2,5), seg4 to (2,6), seg5 to (3,6), tail (4,6) removed, so [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead direction S.\n\nTurn 18: from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- North: (1,4) occupied by seg1, invalid\n\n- South: (1,2) but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n\n- West: invalid\n\n- East: (2,3) — not wall, not obstacle, free.\n\nSo move east to (2,3)\n\nNo food.\n\nThen continue.\n\nSo we can survive.\n\nTherefore, to maximize score, we should eat both foods.\n\nFor the plan:\n\nTurn 12: L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 13: L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: S to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 15: W to (1,5)\n\nTurn 16: S to (1,4) eat\n\nThen beyond, but we can stop here for the answer.\n\nAt turn 16, we eat (1,4), so we have two more points.\n\nIf at turn 14 we go W to (1,6), then turn 15 S to (1,5), turn 16 S to (1,4) eat, but missed (2,5), so only one point from (1,4), whereas eating both gives two points.\n\nSo better to eat (2,5).\n\nNow for the answer, we need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince t1=12, output turns 12 to 16 or 17.\n\nBut in the format, it should be actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 13, we had only one choice, L.\n\nSimilarly, turn 14 we choose S.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 12, action is L.\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: D (down, since south)\n\nIn the action, U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), L for left (x-1), R for right (x+1)\n\nSo from (2,6) to (2,5) is down, so D.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,5) to (1,4) is down, D.\n\nIn turn 15, from (2,5) to (1,5) is west, left, so L.\n\nNow, for turn 16, from (1,5) to (1,4) is S, D.\n\nBut we can include that.\n\nSince we planned to eat (1,4) at turn 16.\n\nBut to be precise, let's list.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nThat should work.\n\nFor turn 16, when at (1,5), moving D to (1,4) eats the food.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we want more turns, but I think 5 actions are fine.\n\nTurn 12 to 16 is 5 turns: 12,13,14,15,16.\n\nt1 to t1+4.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, but output can be for multiple turns.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so we can list several.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n\nBut to confirm, at turn 14, if we go W to (1,6), action L, then turn 15 D to (1,5), turn 16 D to (1,4), but missed (2,5), so score lower.\n\nSo better with D at turn 14.\n\nAlso, no risk of tail reward danger since no food on tail.\n\nSo final plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating positive food when safe and avoiding collisions. The current state (turn 12) has the snake at [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] with head direction U. The only immediate safe move is left (L) to (3,6) to eat the positive food there, as other moves lead to walls or body collisions.\n\nAfter eating at (3,6), the snake grows, and subsequent moves must be planned to eat the remaining food at (2,5) (life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 14) and (1,4) (life span 8, can be eaten later). Moving to (2,5) at turn 14 is critical to avoid missing the food, as it disappears after turn 14. Eating (2,5) increases the score and length, but the snake must then navigate carefully to avoid getting trapped in the corner near (1,4). After eating (1,4) at turn 16, the snake can continue moving south and east to safer areas for future survival.\n\nThe planned actions for turns 12 to 16 are:\n- **Turn 12**: Move left (L) to (3,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 4).\n- **Turn 13**: Move left (L) to (2,6) (no food, snake shifts but length remains 4).\n- **Turn 14**: Move down (D) to (2,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 5). This must be done now, as (2,5) disappears after this turn.\n- **Turn 15**: Move left (L) to (1,5) (no food, snake shifts but length remains 5).\n- **Turn 16**: Move down (D) to (1,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 6). After this, the snake can move to (1,3) and then (2,3) to explore open areas for future food and survival.\n\nThis sequence scores 3 points over 5 turns and ensures the snake avoids collisions and dead ends. Beyond turn 16, the snake should head east or south to navigate around obstacles and open space for further food opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 13: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 14: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 15: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 16: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 13, and I'm playing Snake. The grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). I should list all obstacles to avoid them.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left last turn. Since it can't instantly reverse, I can't move right on this turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (2,5) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (1,4) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- At (6,3) with life span 10 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks. Since the snake grows when it eats positive food, I have to be careful about collisions, especially with the tail.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So I can't move to those cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSnake: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nHead direction: L, so from (3,6), it came from the right, since positions are head first. Positions: (3,6) head, then (4,6), so it was at (4,6) before moving to (3,6), direction L means it moved left to (3,6).\n\nSince head direction is L, it moved left to (3,6) on the previous turn. So for current turn, t=13, I need to choose a direction: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse, so I cannot move right (opposite of left), so R is forbidden this turn.\n\nPossible moves from (3,6):\n\n- Up (U): to (3,7) but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n\ny=7 is top border, so (3,7) is out of bounds, wall.\n\n- Down (D): to (3,5)\n\n- Left (L): to (2,6)\n\n- Right (R): but opposite direction, forbidden.\n\nSo only possible moves: Down to (3,5) or Left to (2,6).\n\nNow, I need to check if these cells are safe.\n\nFirst, (3,5): is this occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). (3,5) is not in snake, but there's an internal obstacle at (3,5)? Obstacles: (3,5) is listed, yes! Internal obstacles include (3,5).\n\nObstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n\nYes, (3,5) is an obstacle, so I cannot move down to (3,5) because it's a wall.\n\nTherefore, moving down is invalid.\n\nOnly possible move is left to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is within bounds? x=2, y=6, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so yes.\n\nIs (2,6) occupied by snake? Snake: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). No (2,6), so it's free.\n\nAlso, not an obstacle; obstacles are listed, (2,6) not there.\n\nSo only possible action at turn 13 is to move left to (2,6).\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns. The answer should include actions for turn 13, 14, 15, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn t1=13, so actions for turn 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, I think.\n\nBut I need to think ahead based on the food and survival.\n\nFirst, let's confirm turn 13 action.\n\nSince only one move possible: L to (2,6).\n\nAfter moving, snake positions: head moves to (2,6), then the body: since it moves, the tail will move away from (5,5), so new positions: head (2,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, so [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]? Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6), the body segments follow: the first body segment (4,6) moves to where head was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front. So:\n\n- Head was at (3,6), moves to (2,6)\n\n- Then, the segment that was at (4,6) moves to (3,6)\n\n- The segment that was at (4,5) moves to (4,6)? Positions: index 0: head (3,6), index 1: (4,6), index 2: (4,5), index 3: tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move left:\n\n- New head: (2,6)\n\n- Then, index 1 moves to old head position (3,6)\n\n- Index 2 moves to old index 1 position (4,6)\n\n- Index 3 (tail) moves to old index 2 position (4,5)\n\nBut old index 2 was (4,5), so tail moves to (4,5).\n\nNew positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTail was at (5,5), which is now empty.\n\nNow, food: there is food at (2,5) with life span 2, value 1.\n\n(2,5) is not the head position; head is at (2,6).\n\nAfter this move, on turn 13, the head is at (2,6). Food at (2,5) is below it.\n\nLife span of food: it decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 13, before action? The state is given for turn 13, so food life spans are as of turn 13.\n\nFood: (2,5,2,1) meaning at (2,5), life span 2, so it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) - Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nFor example, food at (2,5) with life span 2 at turn 13.\n\nAfter turn 13, life span decreases by 1, so at start of turn 14, it will be 1.\n\nAfter turn 14, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten only on turn 13 or 14.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (1,4) life span 7, so available from turn 13 to turn 13+7-1=19? Life span N, available for N turns including current.\n\nAt turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1.\n\nAfter turn t+L-1, it's gone.\n\nFor (2,5): L=2 at t=13, so can be eaten on turn 13 or 14. Disappears after turn 14.\n\nTurn 13: if head moves to (2,5), it eats, but on turn 13, head is moving from (3,6) to (2,6), not to (2,5), so no eat on turn 13.\n\nThen on turn 14, if head moves to (2,5), it can eat.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) L=7 at t=13, so available from t=13 to t=19 (since 13 to 13+6=19, 7 turns: t=13,14,15,16,17,18,19, disappears after 19).\n\n(6,3) L=10, available from t=13 to t=22.\n\nNow back to turn 13: I must move left to (2,6), as that's the only possible move.\n\nThen, on turn 14, head at (2,6), and I need to choose action.\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- U: to (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (2,5)\n\n- L: to (1,6)\n\n- R: to (3,6) — but (3,6) is now occupied by the snake body? After turn 13 move, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\n(3,6) is the first body segment, so moving right to (3,6) would cause collision with body, deadly.\n\nAlso, R is not opposite to current head direction? Head direction: after moving left to (2,6), the head direction is now L (since it moved left).\n\nFor turn 14, current head direction is L.\n\nSo no instant reverse, cannot move R (right), but R is to (3,6) which is body, so invalid anyway.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D: to (2,5)\n\n- L: to (1,6)\n\nU is invalid, R is invalid or forbidden.\n\nNow, (2,5) has food! Positive food, life span 2, but at turn 14, if I move there, life span will be 1 (since decreased from 2 at t=13 to 1 at t=14 start?).\n\nAt turn 14, before action, life span of (2,5) is 1 (after decreasing from turn 13).\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 14, I eat it.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nFirst, moving to (2,5): is it occupied? After turn 13, snake is at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (2,5) is not occupied, not an obstacle.\n\nObstacles: (2,5) not in obstacle list.\n\nBut there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIf I eat the food, snake grows, so new tail position.\n\nCurrently, snake has 4 segments. After eating, length increases by one, so new positions after eat: head at (2,5), then the body: since it eats, the tail doesn't move, so segments: head to (2,5), then the previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) stays, and a new segment is added where? When snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move; it adds a new segment at the tail position.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, head moves to food cell, food is consumed, and the snake grows by one segment, meaning that the tail does not move that turn; it stays in place, and a new segment is added there. But since the tail doesn't move, the segment before tail remains, but the new segment is at the old tail position.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions: head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail.\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves old position.\n\nAfter move with eating: head moves to new cell (food), food consumed, then the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n\nTypically, when snake eats, after head moves to food, the tail remains in place, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nSo positions: new head at food, then the previous positions of all body segments, including the tail, are kept, but since the tail didn't move, it's like adding a new segment at tail.\n\nFor example: positions before: [head, seg1, seg2, tail]\n\nAfter move without eat: [new_head, old_head, seg1, seg2]  // tail gone\n\nAfter move with eat: [new_head, old_head, seg1, seg2, old_tail]  // tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nIn this case, before turn 14 move, positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nIf move down to (2,5) and eat food: new head (2,5), then old head (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6), then (4,6), and since eat, tail (4,5) stays, so new positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nNow, the tail is at (4,5), and head is at (2,5).\n\nNow, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, the food is at (2,5), which head is moving to, but the tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to head; (2,5) and (4,5) are two cells apart, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means neighboring cells: up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (2,5), adjacent cells: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5)\n\n(2,6) has a body segment, (3,5) is obstacle, etc.\n\nTail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (2,5).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nMoreover, the food is at (2,5), not on tail cell.\n\nTail Reward Danger only if the food is on the tail cell and head moves to it while adjacent, but here food is at (2,5), tail is at (4,5), different cell.\n\nSo eating (2,5) is safe.\n\nNow, alternative move: left to (1,6)\n\n(1,6) is within bounds, not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nBut if I move to (1,6), no food there, so snake moves without growing: new positions [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]? Tail was (4,5), moves to (4,6) or something.\n\nAfter turn 13: positions [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nIf move to (1,6) on turn 14: head to (1,6), then body: (2,6) to old head (2,6)? New head (1,6), then seg1 to old head (2,6), seg2 to old seg1 (3,6), tail to old seg2 (4,6), so new positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\n(4,5) is now empty.\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nBut at (2,5), food will disappear after turn 14, so if I don't eat it on turn 14, I lose it.\n\nNow, comparing: moving to (2,5) gives +1 score and grows snake, while moving to (1,6) does nothing, and I miss the food.\n\nMoreover, after moving to (1,6), I might be farther from other food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is food at (1,4), which is close, and (6,3) far.\n\nBut first, on turn 14, moving to (2,5) seems better to get the food.\n\nAlso, life span is short, only available this turn or gone.\n\nAt turn 14, it can be eaten, then disappears.\n\nIf I don't eat, it's wasted.\n\nSo I should eat it.\n\nBut let's confirm if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating, snake is longer, which might cause issues later, but currently it's fine.\n\nNow, after turn 14, if I eat at (2,5), positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] with 5 segments.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction after moving down is D.\n\nNow, for turn 15, I need to move from (2,5).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,6) but (2,6) is occupied by body segment, so collision, invalid.\n\n- D: to (2,4)\n\n- L: to (1,5)\n\n- R: to (3,5) but (3,5) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,4) or L to (1,5)\n\nNow, (2,4): is it free? Not snake, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is in the list? Internal obstacles: (2,4) yes! (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n(2,4) is wall.\n\nSo D to (2,4) invalid.\n\nOnly possible is L to (1,5)\n\n(1,5) is within bounds, not snake, not obstacle.\n\nSo must move left to (1,5) on turn 15.\n\nNo food there.\n\nAfter move: head to (1,5), body moves: new positions [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] and tail (4,5) moved? After eat on turn 14, positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nNow, without eating, move to (1,5): head to (1,5), then seg1 to old head (2,5), seg2 to old seg1 (2,6), seg3 to old seg2 (3,6), tail to old seg3 (4,6), so new positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\n(4,5) is empty.\n\nNow head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 16: from (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,6)\n\n- D: to (1,4) — there is food at (1,4)!\n\n- L: to (0,5) but x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nAlso, R is opposite to current direction? Current head direction is L (since moved left to (1,5)), so cannot move R, but R is invalid anyway.\n\nU to (1,6): is (1,6) occupied? Current positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\n(1,6) is not in snake, not obstacle, so possible.\n\nD to (1,4): not occupied, and food there.\n\nLife span of (1,4): at turn 13, life span 7, so at turn 16, it has decreased by 3 turns (t13,14,15), so at start of turn 16, life span 4? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 13: life span 7\n\nAfter turn 13: decrease to 6\n\nAfter turn 14: decrease to 5\n\nAfter turn 15: decrease to 4\n\nSo at turn 16, before action, life span is 4, can be eaten on turn 16.\n\nNow, if I move D to (1,4), I eat the food.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger? Food at (1,4), head at (1,5), moving down to (1,4).\n\nTail is at (4,6), not adjacent to (1,4).\n\nNo issue.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), no food.\n\nBut (1,6) might be useful later? Not sure.\n\nEating (1,4) is good, +1 score.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), snake grows: positions: new head (1,4), then old head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and tail (4,6) stays, so new positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nTail at (4,6).\n\nHead at (1,4), direction D.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,4):\n\n- U: to (1,5) but (1,5) is body, collision\n\n- D: to (1,3)\n\n- L: to (0,4) x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle.\n\nSo only possible move: D to (1,3)\n\n(1,3) is within bounds, not snake, not obstacle.\n\nSo must move down to (1,3).\n\nNo food there.\n\nAfter move: head to (1,3), body: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] tail moves to (3,6)? Positions: after eat, [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nMove down to (1,3): head to (1,3), then seg1 to (1,4), seg2 to (1,5), seg3 to (2,5), seg4 to (2,6), tail to (3,6), so new positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\n(4,6) empty.\n\nNow head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 17: from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, collision\n\n- D: to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is listed, yes, so invalid\n\n- L: to (0,3) wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (2,3)\n\nSo only possible: R to (2,3)\n\n(2,3) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nMove right to (2,3).\n\nNo food.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I have another food at (6,3) with life span 10, so I need to head towards it eventually.\n\nBut for now, let's list the actions so far.\n\nTurn 13: must move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: I can move D to (2,5) to eat food or L to (1,6)\n\nBut moving L to (1,6) might not be good because I miss the food at (2,5), which disappears after this turn.\n\nAlso, after moving to (1,6), what then?\n\nLet's see if I go to (1,6) on turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: from (2,6) move L to (1,6)\n\nPositions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]  // since no eat, tail moved from (4,5) to (4,6)? After turn 13: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nMove to (1,6): head to (1,6), seg1 to (2,6), seg2 to (3,6), tail to (4,6), so [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\n(4,5) empty.\n\nHead at (1,6), direction L.\n\nTurn 15: from (1,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (1,5)\n\n- L: to (0,6) wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (2,6) but (2,6) body, collision, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (1,5)\n\nMove to (1,5), no food.\n\nPositions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 16: from (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,6) body, collision\n\n- D: to (1,4) — food there\n\n- L: wall\n\n- R: to (2,5) — not occupied? Current positions: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), so (2,5) free.\n\n(2,5) has food, but life span: at turn 16, (2,5) disappeared after turn 14, so not there.\n\nOnly (1,4) and (6,3) food.\n\nSo from (1,5), move D to (1,4) to eat food.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut I missed the (2,5) food.\n\nSo better to eat it on turn 14.\n\nMoreover, with the food at (1,4), I can eat it later, but (2,5) is expiring soon.\n\nSo for turn 14, I should move down to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 15, I moved to (1,5), then turn 16 to (1,4) to eat, then turn 17 to (1,3), but (1,3) to (1,2) is obstacle, so I moved right to (2,3).\n\nNow at turn 17, head at (1,3) after move to (1,3)? Let's list positions.\n\nAfter turn 16: after eating at (1,4), positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 14 eat at (2,5): positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] no.\n\nTurn 14: head to (2,5), eat, positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 15: move to (1,5), no eat, positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] // tail (4,5) moved to (4,6)\n\nTurn 16: move to (1,4), eat food, positions: new head (1,4), then old head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and tail (4,6) stays, so [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 17: move to (1,3), no eat, positions: head to (1,3), seg1 to (1,4), seg2 to (1,5), seg3 to (2,5), seg4 to (2,6), tail to (3,6), so [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D? Moved down to (1,3), so direction D.\n\nNow turn 18: from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,4) body, collision\n\n- D: to (1,2) obstacle, invalid\n\n- L: to (0,3) wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (2,3)\n\nSo must move R to (2,3)\n\n(2,3) free.\n\nMove to (2,3), no food.\n\nPositions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)] // head (2,3), then seg1 to old head (1,3), seg2 to old seg1 (1,4), seg3 to old seg2 (1,5), seg4 to old seg3 (2,5), tail to old seg4 (2,6)\n\nSegments: index: head (1,3), seg1 (1,4), seg2 (1,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), tail (3,6) in previous.\n\nAfter move to (2,3): new head (2,3), then old head (1,3) becomes body, then old seg1 (1,4), old seg2 (1,5), old seg3 (2,5), old seg4 (2,6), and tail (3,6) moves to old seg4 position (2,6)? Tail was at (3,6), moves to where seg4 was, which is (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) is now occupied by the new body.\n\nPositions before move: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nAfter move to (2,3): head (2,3), then body: position of old head (1,3), then old seg1 (1,4), old seg2 (1,5), old seg3 (2,5), old seg4 (2,6), and tail (3,6) moves to old seg4 position (2,6), but (2,6) is now the position of the new body segment? Conflict.\n\nStandard: each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n\n- Then, the segment that was at (1,3) moves to where? The first body segment is the old head, which was at (1,3), but now it moves to the new position? No.\n\nThe body segments shift: the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's old position.\n\nSo:\n\n- The cell that was head (1,3) becomes the first body segment at (1,3)\n\n- Then the segment that was at (1,4) moves to the old position of the first body segment, which is (1,3)? Messy.\n\nBetter to think: the positions are updated sequentially.\n\nStart with positions: P0 = head (1,3), P1 = (1,4), P2 = (1,5), P3 = (2,5), P4 = (2,6), P5 = tail (3,6)\n\nAfter moving head to new position N = (2,3)\n\nThen, new P0 = N = (2,3)\n\nNew P1 = old P0 = (1,3)\n\nNew P2 = old P1 = (1,4)\n\nNew P3 = old P2 = (1,5)\n\nNew P4 = old P3 = (2,5)\n\nNew P5 = old P4 = (2,6)  // tail moves to old P4\n\nOld P5 (3,6) is now empty.\n\nSo new positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nNow head at (2,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nNow, I need to think about the other food at (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has life span 10, at turn 13, so available until turn 22.\n\nCurrent turn: after turn 18, head at (2,3).\n\nI should plan to go towards (6,3).\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, the path: from (2,3) to (6,3), same y=3.\n\nBut obstacles in between.\n\nInternal obstacles: let's list all: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nOn row y=3, no obstacles listed, but walls at borders.\n\n(2,3) to (6,3): can I go right directly?\n\nCells: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) has food, but is it free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n(3,3), (4,3), (5,3) should be free, no obstacles listed.\n\nBut there might be snake body.\n\nCurrent positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nSo (3,3) is free, etc.\n\nBut I need to move step by step.\n\nAlso, head direction is R.\n\nFor turn 18, head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: to (2,2)\n\n- L: to (1,3) but (1,3) is body, collision\n\n- R: to (3,3)\n\nAlso, no instant reverse, but L is opposite to R, so cannot move L, but it's invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\n(2,2) is within bounds, not occupied? Current positions have (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), not (2,2).\n\nNot obstacle? Obstacles: (2,2) not listed, but (2,4) is obstacle, not (2,2).\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) free.\n\nNow, food at (6,3), so moving right towards it might be good.\n\nBut moving down to (2,2) might lead to dead end.\n\n(2,2) is bottom-left area.\n\ny=2, x=2.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (2,3) body, D to (2,1), L to (1,2) obstacle, R to (3,2).\n\n(2,1): not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1) is, but (2,1) not.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so L from (2,2) to (1,2) invalid.\n\nSo from (2,2), can go D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,1): then D to (2,0) wall, U to (2,2), L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), etc. Might get stuck.\n\nWhereas moving right to (3,3) is better for reaching (6,3).\n\nSo on turn 18, I should move R to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can continue right.\n\nBut let's see the actions for turns 13 to 17 first.\n\nI need to output actions starting from turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: move L to (2,6) — only choice\n\nTurn 14: move D to (2,5) to eat food — better than L to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 15: move L to (1,5) — only choice\n\nTurn 16: move D to (1,4) to eat food — only choice? From (1,5), could move R to (2,5), but (2,5) is body? At that time, positions: turn 15 end: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\n(2,5) is occupied, so cannot move R, only D to (1,4) or U to (1,6), but U to (1,6) was possible? Turn 16 from (1,5): U to (1,6), which is not occupied? Positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), so (1,6) is free? (1,6) not in positions, not obstacle, so U to (1,6) is possible.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nTurn 16: head at (1,5), direction L (since moved left to (1,5) on turn 15? Turn 15 moved from (2,5) to (1,5) left, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,6)\n\n- D: to (1,4) food\n\n- L: wall\n\n- R: to (2,5) body, collision, invalid.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse, but R is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf U to (1,6), no food, then positions: head to (1,6), body: old head (1,5) to (1,5)? New positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] tail (4,6) to (3,6)? Positions before: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nMove to (1,6): head (1,6), then seg1 to old head (1,5), seg2 to old seg1 (2,5), seg3 to old seg2 (2,6), tail to old seg3 (3,6), so [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\n(4,6) empty.\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 17: from (1,6), U to (1,7) wall invalid, D to (1,5) body, L wall, R to (2,6) body? (2,6) is occupied, so only D but body, stuck! No valid move.\n\nBecause from (1,6), U invalid, D to (1,5) body, L invalid, R to (2,6) which is body segment, collision.\n\nSo if I move U on turn 16, I get stuck on turn 17 with no move.\n\nTherefore, on turn 16, I must move D to (1,4) to eat and survive.\n\nSimilarly, in earlier steps.\n\nSo back to plan.\n\nTurn 13: L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: D to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 15: L to (1,5)  // only choice\n\nTurn 16: D to (1,4) eat  // must, to avoid death\n\nThen turn 17: from (1,4), after eat, positions [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead at (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen only move D to (1,3) as before.\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3)\n\nPositions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]  // after move, no eat\n\nNow turn 18: from (1,3), only move R to (2,3) as U, D, L invalid.\n\nTurn 18: move R to (2,3)\n\nPositions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nHead at (2,3), direction R.\n\nNow for turn 19, I need to choose.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (2,4) obstacle, invalid\n\nD: (2,2)\n\nL: (1,3) body, invalid\n\nR: (3,3)\n\nSo D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\n(2,2) might lead to dead end, (3,3) better for reaching (6,3).\n\nAlso, food at (6,3), I should go right.\n\nMove R to (3,3)\n\nThen positions: head to (3,3), then body: old head (2,3) to (2,3), old seg1 (1,3) to (1,3)? New positions: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] tail (2,6) moves to (2,5)? Positions before: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nAfter move to (3,3): head (3,3), then P1: old P0 (2,3), P2: old P1 (1,3), P3: old P2 (1,4), P4: old P3 (1,5), P5: old P4 (2,5), and old P5 (2,6) gone, new tail at (2,5).\n\nSo [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nHead at (3,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3), possible moves:\n\nU: (3,4) — is it free?

(3,4) should be free.\n\nD: (3,2)\n\nL: (2,3) body, invalid\n\nR: (4,3)\n\nNo instant reverse, but L invalid.\n\nNow, (3,4), (3,2), (4,3) all possible, but need to go to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is right, closer.\n\nMove R to (4,3)\n\nThen similarly, to (5,3), but (5,3) free? Obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) not listed.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) not.\n\nThen to (6,3), but (6,3) has food, but there might be issues.\n\nFirst, from (3,3), if I move U to (3,4), then I might go up, but (6,3) is at y=3.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,2) down.\n\nBut to reach (6,3), moving right is direct.\n\nAlso, check if (4,3) is safe.\n\nCurrent positions: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), so (4,3) free.\n\nMove R to (4,3)\n\nPositions: head (4,3), then P1: (3,3), P2: (2,3), P3: (1,3), P4: (1,4), P5: (1,5), tail at (2,5)? New: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] // old P5 (2,5) not included? Before: P0 (3,3), P1 (2,3), P2 (1,3), P3 (1,4), P4 (1,5), P5 (2,5)\n\nAfter move: new P0 (4,3), P1 old P0 (3,3), P2 old P1 (2,3), P3 old P2 (1,3), P4 old P3 (1,4), P5 old P4 (1,5), and old P5 (2,5) gone.\n\nSo positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nHead at (4,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3), possible moves:\n\nU: (4,4)\n\nD: (4,2)\n\nL: (3,3) body, invalid\n\nR: (5,3)\n\nU or D or R.\n\n(5,3) is towards (6,3).\n\nMove R to (5,3)\n\nThen positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] etc.\n\nHead at (5,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 22: from (5,3), possible moves:\n\nU: (5,4) — obstacle? (5,4) not in list, but (6,4) is obstacle, not (5,4).\n\nObstacles: (6,4), not (5,4).\n\n(5,4) free? Current positions: (5,3), (4,3), etc, not (5,4).\n\nD: (5,2) — but (5,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (5,2), so invalid.\n\nL: (4,3) body, invalid\n\nR: (6,3) — food there.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nR to (6,3) to eat food.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\n(6,3) is within bounds, not occupied, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger? Food at (6,3), head at (5,3), moving right to (6,3).\n\nTail is at (1,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo should be safe.\n\nEat and grow.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), no food, and I might miss the food if life span low, but at turn 22, life span started at 10 at t=13, so at t=22, it decreases: from t=13 to t=22, 10 turns? Life span 10, at t=13, available until t=22? t=13 to t=13+9=22, disappears after t=22.\n\nAt turn 22, before action, life span should be 1 (since decreased over 9 turns from 10 to 1), so can be eaten on turn 22.\n\nIf not eaten, disappears.\n\nSo better to eat on turn 22.\n\nThus, for turn 22, move R to (6,3) to eat.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need actions up to at least turn 17 or more.\n\nThe answer should be for multiple turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nSo for t=13 to, say, t=17 or 18.\n\nBut since I have a plan, I can output up to where I have.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\nTurn 13: L (only choice)\n\nTurn 14: D (to eat (2,5))\n\nTurn 15: L (only)\n\nTurn 16: D (to eat (1,4), only safe choice)\n\nTurn 17: D (to (1,3), only)\n\nTurn 18: R (to (2,3))\n\nAfter that, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"maximize score\", and I ate two foods, and heading to third.\n\nBut in turn 18, I have choice, but I think moving R is better.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, for the food at (6,3), I can reach it around turn 22, but I don't need to output that far.\n\nThe core is to think ahead, but output for immediate turns.\n\nNow, another thing: at turn 14, when I move to (2,5), the food is there, but is there any risk?\n\nEarlier I thought no.\n\nBut let's confirm the Tail Reward Danger specifically.\n\nThe rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nHere, when I eat at (2,5), tail is at (4,5), not adjacent. Tail cell (4,5) has no food; food is at (2,5). So no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for turn 13 to 17 actions:\n\nt13: L\n\nt14: D\n\nt15: L\n\nt16: D\n\nt17: D\n\nThen t18: R or D, but in the plan, I have R to (3,3), but for output, I can stop at t17 or include t18.\n\nThe answer format doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably output 5 actions: t13 to t17.\n\nt13, t14, t15, t16, t17: that's 5 turns.\n\nt13 to t17 inclusive is 5 actions.\n\nt13, t14, t15, t16, t17.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nIn t17, I moved D to (1,3).\n\nIn the sequence, after t16 eat at (1,4), then t17 move D to (1,3).\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the plan.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the head positions:\n\nt13 start: head (3,6), move L to (2,6)\n\nt14: at (2,6), move D to (2,5) eat\n\nt15: at (2,5), move L to (1,5)\n\nt16: at (1,5), move D to (1,4) eat\n\nt17: at (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen for future, from (1,3), move R to (2,3) on t18, and so on.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead (from turn 13 to turn 17) by evaluating all possible moves, food availability, and collision risks. The current state is analyzed as follows:\n\n- **Grid and Obstacles**: The grid is 8x8 (coordinates (0,0) to (7,7)) with border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). These must be avoided.\n- **Snake State**: \n  - Positions: Head at (3,6), body at (4,6), (4,5), tail at (5,5). Length is 4 segments.\n  - Head direction: Left (L), so reverse move (Right, R) is forbidden on turn 13.\n- **Food State**:\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 2 at turn 13. Can be eaten on turns 13 or 14 (disappears after turn 14).\n  - (1,4): Value +1, life span 7 at turn 13. Can be eaten from turns 13 to 19.\n  - (6,3): Value +1, life span 10 at turn 13. Can be eaten from turns 13 to 22.\n- **Key Risks**: \n  - Tail Reward Danger: Eating food adjacent to the tail causes death due to collision after growth. Current tail at (5,5) is not near immediate food targets.\n  - Body/wall collisions: Must avoid snake body segments and obstacles.\n  - Short-term focus: Food at (2,5) expires soon; it should be prioritized if safe.\n  - Long-term path: After eating (2,5) and (1,4), move toward (6,3) for additional points, avoiding dead ends.\n\n### Turn-by-Turn Reasoning (5+ turns ahead)\n- **Turn 13 (Current Turn)**: \n  - Head at (3,6), direction L. Possible moves: \n    - Up (U) to (3,7): Wall (y=7), invalid.\n    - Down (D) to (3,5): Obstacle at (3,5), invalid.\n    - Left (L) to (2,6): Valid and safe (not occupied, not obstacle).\n    - Right (R) to (4,6): Reverse direction, forbidden; also occupied by body.\n  - Only valid move is L to (2,6). No food eaten.\n  - After move: Snake positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)], head direction L.\n\n- **Turn 14**: \n  - Head at (2,6), direction L. Possible moves:\n    - Up (U) to (2,7): Wall (y=7), invalid.\n    - Down (D) to (2,5): Food present (life span 1 at turn start). Valid and safe (not occupied, not obstacle). Eating gains +1 score and grows snake to length 5.\n    - Left (L) to (1,6): Valid and safe (not occupied, not obstacle), but misses expiring food at (2,5).\n    - Right (R) to (3,6): Occupied by body; also reverse direction, invalid.\n  - **Decision**: Move D to (2,5) to eat food. This is optimal to capture expiring food and increase score. Tail at (4,5) is not adjacent, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n  - After move and eat: Snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)], head direction D.\n\n- **Turn 15**: \n  - Head at (2,5), direction D. Possible moves:\n    - Up (U) to (2,6): Occupied by body, invalid.\n    - Down (D) to (2,4): Obstacle at (2,4), invalid.\n    - Left (L) to (1,5): Valid and safe (not occupied, not obstacle).\n    - Right (R) to (3,5): Obstacle, invalid.\n  - Only valid move is L to (1,5). No food eaten.\n  - After move: Snake positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)], head direction L.\n\n- **Turn 16**: \n  - Head at (1,5), direction L. Possible moves:\n    - Up (U) to (1,6): Valid and safe, but no food. Leads to dead end on turn 17 (no valid moves from (1,6)).\n    - Down (D) to (1,4): Food present (life span 4 at turn start). Valid and safe (not occupied, not obstacle). Eating gains +1 score and grows snake to length 6.\n    - Left (L) to (0,5): Wall (x=0), invalid.\n    - Right (R) to (2,5): Occupied by body; also reverse direction, invalid.\n  - **Decision**: Move D to (1,4) to eat food. Avoids death from U move dead end and captures food. Tail at (4,6) is not adjacent, no Tail Reward Danger.\n  - After move and eat: Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)], head direction D.\n\n- **Turn 17**: \n  - Head at (1,4), direction D. Possible moves:\n    - Up (U) to (1,5): Occupied by body, invalid.\n    - Down (D) to (1,3): Valid and safe (not occupied, not obstacle).\n    - Left (L) to (0,4): Wall (x=0), invalid.\n    - Right (R) to (2,4): Obstacle, invalid.\n  - Only valid move is D to (1,3). No food eaten.\n  - After move: Snake positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)], head direction D.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 17)\n- **Turn 18+**: From (1,3), move Right (R) to (2,3) to avoid dead end (Down to (1,2) is obstacle). Then continue toward (6,3) for additional food, e.g., via (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), reaching (6,3) by turn 22 to eat before it expires.\n- **Risk Assessment**: No immediate collisions; path to (6,3) is open with no obstacles on y=3 row except at (5,2), which is avoidable. Tail Reward Danger is low as tail moves away from head.\n\nThis plan scores +2 by eating both (2,5) and (1,4), with a path to +3 from (6,3). It prioritizes survival by avoiding forced dead ends and leveraging safe food opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: L (left)\nTurn 14: D (down)\nTurn 15: L (left)\nTurn 16: D (down)\nTurn 17: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 14, and I'm playing Snake. The grid has walls and obstacles, so I must avoid those as well as the snake's own body.\n\nThe grid size isn't explicitly given, but from the border cells: x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at the borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Additionally, there are internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). I should list all these to visualize.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is L, which means it was moving left last turn, so from (3,6) to (2,6). Since head direction is L, and we're at (2,6), previous position was to the right, which is (3,6), so moving left to (2,6).\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, meaning if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 6. So it has 6 turns left, including this one.\n\n- (6,3) with value 1 and life span 9. All food has value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1 for all, and no negative food mentioned, so all are +1 reward.\n\nThe food values are all 1, and no negative values, so I should eat them to grow, but need to be careful about risks.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch an 8x8 grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nList them:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,4)\n\nSnake: head at (2,6), body at (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So:\n\n- Head: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nSince head is at (2,6) and moving left, last move was from (3,6) to (2,6).\n\nCurrent possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because R would be opposite direction, and no instant reverse is allowed. Head direction L means last move was left, so I cannot move right on the next turn.\n\nSo possible actions: U (up), D (down), L (left). R is not allowed because it would be reverse.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does:\n\n- U: (x,y+1) from (2,6) to (2,7)\n\nBut y=7 is a border wall, so (2,7) is a wall, cannot move there. Deadly collision.\n\n- D: (x,y-1) from (2,6) to (2,5)\n\n- L: (x-1,y) from (2,6) to (1,6)\n\n- R: not allowed.\n\nSo U is invalid because wall. D to (2,5), L to (1,6).\n\nNow, what about (2,5)? Is it occupied? Snake positions are (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (2,5) is not in snake positions, so it should be free, but there's food at (2,5) with life span 1.\n\nFood is at (2,5), which is below the head.\n\nAlso, (1,6) might be free? Let's check.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: all border and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nFood: (2,5), (1,4), (6,3)\n\nNow, (2,5): is it a wall? No, walls are only borders and listed obstacles. (2,5) is not in obstacles, not border? y=5, x=2, borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (2,5) is within 1-6 in both, so no border wall. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed, so free, but has food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): x=1, y=6, not border, not in obstacles list, so free? Obstacles include (1,2), but that's different. So (1,6) should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nI should make a small grid.\n\nFor y from 7 to 0, x from 0 to 7.\n\nBut since walls are borders, cells (x,y) with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAdditionally, internal obstacles.\n\nFor move to (2,5): (2,5) is not wall, not snake body? Snake body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (4,5) is tail, but (2,5) is different cell. So moving to (2,5) should be possible, and there's food.\n\nBut if I move to (2,5), I eat the food, since head moves there.\n\nNow, life span of that food is 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, other food has longer life.\n\nAlso, need to consider tail reward danger, but that might not apply here.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head: (2,6)\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U: (2,7) - but y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (2,5) - free, has food with value +1, life span 1.\n\n- L: (1,6) - let's check if free. x=1, y=6, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (1,2) etc., not (1,6), so should be free. Snake positions: (1,6) not occupied, so free.\n\n- R: (3,6) - but (3,6) is the first body segment. If I move right to (3,6), that is where the body is, but since the snake moves, the tail will move away, but let's see.\n\nRule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment except the tail in certain cases.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) tail.\n\nIf I move right to (3,6), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. But after the move, the head would be at (3,6), and the body will move: the segment at (3,6) will move to where? When head moves, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nStandard snake movement: if head moves to a new cell, the neck moves to head's old position, and so on, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n\nSo, if head moves to (3,6), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. But at the time of move, (3,6) has a body part, so moving there would cause collision, unless it's the tail.\n\nBut the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (3,6) is not the tail; it's the neck, the first body segment after head. Tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo moving to (3,6) would be moving into a body segment that is not the tail, so it should cause collision.\n\nConfirm: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\"\n\nAnd exception only for tail: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment\"\n\nIn this case, (3,6) is body, not tail, so moving to (3,6) should be fatal.\n\nSimilarly, in the list, (3,6) is occupied now.\n\nSo moving R to (3,6) is invalid, collision.\n\nTherefore, only possible moves are D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nNow, D to (2,5) has food, which is positive and will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nL to (1,6) is empty, no food.\n\nI need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food; otherwise, length unchanged.\n\nIf I eat the food at (2,5), snake length increases by 1, so new positions: head at (2,5), then the old head (2,6) becomes new neck, so body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) remains? No.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows: so after eating, the head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move immediately? No.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place, meaning the snake grows by one cell.\n\nThen next move, the tail moves as usual.\n\nFor example, if head moves to food, new positions: head at food, then previous head, then body, and tail stays. So length increases.\n\nIn this case, if I move D to (2,5), eat food, then new snake: head (2,5), then previous head (2,6), then (3,6), then (4,6), and tail (4,5) but since it grows, (4,5) is still there, and new segment? Positions: before move: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nAfter moving down to (2,5) and eating: head to (2,5), then the segments: the neck moves to old head position (2,6), then (3,6), then (4,6), and the tail (4,5) remains, but since we ate, a new segment is added, but where? The new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the new position is added.\n\nSo new positions: head at (2,5), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail at (4,5). But (4,5) was already there, and we add a new segment, but (4,5) is occupied, so the tail cell stays, and the new segment is the old tail position? I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake growth: when head eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail is about to move, it doesn't move; instead, the tail stays, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nFor example, positions before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n\nAfter eating and moving: new head at food cell, say F, then H becomes B1, B1 becomes B2, B2 becomes something, T stays.\n\nIn this case: before: head (2,6), B1 (3,6), B2 (4,6), T (4,5)\n\nAfter moving down to (2,5) and eating: head at (2,5), then B1 at old head (2,6), then B2 at old B1 (3,6), then B3 at old B2 (4,6), and tail at old T (4,5), but since we ate, we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move; it stays at (4,5), and we have an additional segment.\n\nSo positions: head (2,5), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), B3 (4,6), tail (4,5). But (4,6) is B3, and tail is (4,5), so the segment at (4,6) is body, and (4,5) is tail.\n\nLength is now 5.\n\nIf no eat, head moves to new position, tail moves off, length same.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nIf I go D to (2,5), I eat the food, grow to length 5, and head is now at (2,5), direction down.\n\nIf I go L to (1,6), no eat, head at (1,6), direction left, length 4.\n\nNow, the food at (2,5) will be gone after this turn if not eaten.\n\nSo if I don't eat it, it disappears.\n\nNow, other food: (1,4) with life 6, so 6 turns including this, so after 6 turns it disappears.\n\n(6,3) with life 9.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate choice.\n\nIf I eat the food at (2,5), I get +1, grow to 5, but then head at (2,5), which is surrounded? Let's see possible moves from there.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), head at (2,5), body at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), tail at (4,5).\n\nDirection is down.\n\nPossible moves: since last move was D, I cannot move up (opposite).\n\nSo can move D, L, R.\n\n- D: (2,4) - but (2,4) is an internal obstacle! From the list: (2,4) is an obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- L: (1,5) - is this free? x=1,y=5, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (1,2), (2,4), etc., (1,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- R: (3,5) - but (3,5) is an internal obstacle! From list: (3,5) is obstacle.\n\nSo from (2,5), if I go down, (2,4) wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,5), possible.\n\nRight to (3,5), obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) has no food, I think.\n\nFood is at (1,4) and (6,3), not (1,5).\n\nSo after eating at (2,5), I must move to (1,5) next.\n\nThen from (1,5), direction left or down? Last move was to (1,5) from (2,5), so direction L (since x decreased).\n\nThen from (1,5), possible moves: U, D, L? Cannot R, opposite.\n\n- U: (1,6) - but (1,6) is where? From (1,5) to (1,6), y+1.\n\n(1,6) is within bounds? y=6, not border, not obstacle. But after previous moves, if I came from (2,5) to (1,5), and snake body is at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) or something.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 14: start, head at (2,6), move D to (2,5), eat food, grow.\n\nAfter move: positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5)  [since growth, tail stays]\n\nIn terms of segments: indices: head at (2,5), then segment 1 at (2,6), segment 2 at (3,6), segment 3 at (4,6), segment 4 at (4,5)\n\nNow turn 15: from (2,5), only possible move is L to (1,5), since D and R blocked.\n\nMove to (1,5), no food there.\n\nAfter move: head at (1,5), then body: old head (2,5) becomes neck, so (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) moves? When no eat, tail moves off.\n\nAfter moving to (1,5), no eat, so head to (1,5), then the neck moves to old head (2,5), then segment 2 to old segment 1 (2,6), segment 3 to old segment 2 (3,6), and tail moves to old segment 3 (4,6)? Positions: before move: [H=(2,5), B1=(2,6), B2=(3,6), B3=(4,6), T=(4,5)]\n\nAfter moving to (1,5): head to (1,5), then B1 moves to old H position (2,5), B2 moves to old B1 position (2,6), B3 moves to old B2 position (3,6), and tail moves to old B3 position (4,6). But old B3 was (4,6), so tail moves to (4,6), and the old tail (4,5) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), B3 (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nNow head at (1,5), last move left.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L (cannot R, opposite).\n\n- U: (1,6) - (1,6) is now free? After move, positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So (1,6) is not occupied, not wall? Not border, not obstacle, so free.\n\n- D: (1,4) - (1,4) has food! Food at (1,4) with value 1.\n\n- L: (0,5) - x=0 is border wall, invalid.\n\nSo can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf go D to (1,4), eat food, grow.\n\nThen head at (1,4), and so on.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is one scenario.\n\nFirst, back to turn 14.\n\nIf instead of moving down, I move left to (1,6).\n\nTurn 14: move L to (1,6), no food there (food is at (2,5), (1,4), (6,3)), so no eat.\n\nAfter move: head to (1,6), then body: old head (2,6) becomes neck, so (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) moves to? No eat, so tail moves off.\n\nBefore: [H=(2,6), B1=(3,6), B2=(4,6), T=(4,5)]\n\nAfter move L to (1,6): head (1,6), B1 to old H (2,6), B2 to old B1 (3,6), tail to old B2 (4,6)\n\nSo positions: head (1,6), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nNow head at (1,6), direction left.\n\nFrom (1,6), possible moves: since last move L, cannot R.\n\n- U: (1,7) - y=7 border wall, invalid\n\n- D: (1,5) - free? Not occupied, not wall\n\n- L: (0,6) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: not allowed, opposite\n\nSo only D to (1,5)\n\nMove to (1,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 15: from (1,5), last move down? From (1,6) to (1,5), so direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: D, L, R (cannot U, opposite)\n\n- D: (1,4) - has food\n\n- L: (0,5) - wall\n\n- R: (2,5) - but (2,5) is where? After previous, positions: after moving to (1,5), head (1,5), B1 (1,6)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 14 move to (1,6): positions [H=(1,6), B1=(2,6), B2=(3,6), T=(4,6)]\n\nThen turn 15: move D to (1,5), no food.\n\nAfter move: head to (1,5), B1 to old H (1,6), B2 to old B1 (2,6), tail to old B2 (3,6)\n\nSo positions: head (1,5), B1 (1,6), B2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nNow head at (1,5), last move down.\n\nThen from (1,5), moves: D to (1,4) eat food, or L to (0,5) invalid, or R to (2,5) which is free? (2,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\nBut (2,5) had food, but if we didn't eat it on turn 14, it disappears after turn 14, since life span 1, and turn 14 is when it can be eaten or it vanishes.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nFood at (2,5) has life span 1 at turn 14. So on turn 14, if eaten, good; else, after turn 14, it disappears, so on turn 15, no food at (2,5).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this case, on turn 14, if I move L to (1,6), I don't eat (2,5), so it vanishes.\n\nThen on turn 15, from (1,5), I can move D to (1,4) to eat the food there, or R to (2,5) which is now empty.\n\n(1,4) has food with life span 6, so still available.\n\nNow, comparing the two options at turn 14.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (2,5), eat food, grow to length 5. Then must go to (1,5) on turn 15. Then from (1,5), I can go to (1,4) or (1,6), but (1,6) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn that path: after turn 15 move to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), B3 (3,6), tail (4,6) — from earlier.\n\nThen from (1,5), last move left? From (2,5) to (1,5), so left.\n\nThen moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L invalid.\n\n(1,6) is free? Positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), so (1,6) is not occupied, free.\n\n(1,4) has food.\n\nSo I can go U or D.\n\nIf go D to (1,4), eat food, grow to 6.\n\nThen head at (1,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival and other food.\n\nOption 2 at turn 14: move L to (1,6), no eat, length 4. Then must go D to (1,5) on turn 15, no eat. Then from (1,5), can go D to (1,4) to eat or R to (2,5) empty.\n\nNow, the food at (1,4) has life span 6, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's see the grid and obstacles.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,3), which is far, life span 9.\n\nNow, I should consider the risks.\n\nFirst, in option 1, after eating (2,5), I go to (1,5), then if I go to (1,4), I eat another food, growing to 6.\n\nBut then I might be cornered.\n\nLet's list all obstacles to see free space.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, which is below (2,5).\n\n(3,5) obstacle.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nThe area around (1,4) to (1,6) might be tight.\n\nFrom (1,4), if head there after eating, direction down.\n\nThen possible moves: since last move D, cannot U.\n\nD to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, wall.\n\nSo only D to (1,3), if free.\n\n(1,3) not obstacle, not border, should be free.\n\nThen from (1,3), etc.\n\nBut there's obstacle at (1,2), so down to (1,2) invalid, so I need to go left or right, but left is wall, right to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) free? No obstacle listed, so yes.\n\nBut I'm getting too deep.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, eating the immediate food might not be best if it traps me.\n\nBut the food at (2,5) will disappear if not eaten now.\n\nIf I eat it, I grow, but I have to go to (1,5), then I can eat (1,4) soon.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5), it vanishes, and I go to (1,6) then (1,5), then I can still eat (1,4) from there.\n\nBut by not eating (2,5), I stay length 4, and have more flexibility.\n\nLet's think about the tail reward danger, but not relevant yet.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body positions might block paths.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,3) is on the other side, with obstacles.\n\nTo reach (6,3), I need to navigate through the grid.\n\nFor example, from current, if I go left to (1,6), then down to (1,5), then I can go to (1,4) or to (2,5) empty, then from (2,5) I can go down to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot. From (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), but (2,6) might be body; D to (2,4) obstacle; L to (1,5); R to (3,5) obstacle. So only L to (1,5) or U to (2,6) if free.\n\nBut at that point, it might be occupied.\n\nI should simulate both paths for a few turns.\n\nFirst, let's define the state at turn 14.\n\nCurrent turn 14.\n\nOption A: Move D to (2,5), eat food. Snake grows to length 5. Head at (2,5), direction D. Food at (2,5) eaten, removed. Other food: (1,4) life span 6, now at turn 14, so after this turn, life decreases to 5? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 14, food at (2,5) has life span 1, so if not eaten, after turn 14 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) life span 6, at turn 14, after turn 14, life span 5, and so on.\n\nFor (1,4), life span 6 at turn 14, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, so on turns 14 to 19 it exists, and after turn 19 it's gone. Since countdown decreases each turn, at turn 14, life span 6, after turn 14, life span 5, and so on, until 0.\n\nSimilarly for (6,3), life span 9 at turn 14, so exists until turn 22.\n\nAfter move D to (2,5), turn 14 done.\n\nTurn 15: head at (2,5), direction D. Only possible move L to (1,5), no food there. Move to (1,5). No eat, so snake moves, tail moves. Positions before move: head (2,5), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), B3 (4,6), tail (4,5)? From earlier: after eating at (2,5), positions: head (2,5), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), B3 (4,6), tail (4,5) — but (4,5) is tail.\n\nWhen no eat, tail moves.\n\nMove to (1,5): head to (1,5), B1 to old head (2,5), B2 to old B1 (2,6), B3 to old B2 (3,6), tail to old B3 (4,6). And old tail (4,5) vacated.\n\nSo positions: head (1,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), B3 (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nHead direction: moved from (2,5) to (1,5), so left.\n\nFood: (1,4) life span now 5 (after turn 14, decreased), (6,3) life span 8.\n\nTurn 16: from (1,5), last move L, so can move U, D, L? Cannot R.\n\n- U: (1,6) - is it free? Positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), so (1,6) not occupied, not wall, free.\n\n- D: (1,4) - has food, life span 5\n\n- L: (0,5) - wall, invalid\n\nSo can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf go D to (1,4), eat food, grow. Head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen positions: after eating, head (1,4), B1 at old head (1,5), B2 at old B1 (2,5), B3 at old B2 (2,6), tail at old B3 (3,6), and new segment, so tail stays, positions: head (1,4), B1 (1,5), B2 (2,5), B3 (2,6), tail (3,6) — but since grow, add new segment at tail, so tail position is old tail position, but not moving.\n\nAfter eating: head to (1,4), B1 to (1,5), B2 to (2,5), B3 to (2,6), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position, so B4 at (3,6), and tail at (4,6) but (4,6) was tail, so now B4 at (3,6), tail at (4,6)? Let's list:\n\nBefore move at turn 16: positions [H=(1,5), B1=(2,5), B2=(2,6), B3=(3,6), T=(4,6)]\n\nMove to (1,4) and eat: head to (1,4), then B1 to old H (1,5), B2 to old B1 (2,5), B3 to old B2 (2,6), and since ate, add new segment at old T position? No, when eating, the new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the new position is the old tail position.\n\nSo after move: head (1,4), B1 (1,5), B2 (2,5), B3 (2,6), B4 (3,6), tail (4,6) — B4 is new body, tail at (4,6).\n\nLength 6.\n\nThen from (1,4), last move D, so cannot U.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\n- D: (1,3) - free? Not wall, not obstacle, should be free.\n\n- L: (0,4) - wall\n\n- R: (2,4) - but (2,4) is obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (1,3)\n\nMove to (1,3), no food.\n\nThen turn 17: head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nMoves: D to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,2), so wall, invalid.\n\nL to (0,3) wall.\n\nR to (2,3) - free? Not wall, not obstacle.\n\nSo only R to (2,3)\n\nAnd so on. But I'm getting stuck in the bottom left.\n\nIf at turn 16 from (1,5), I go U to (1,6) instead.\n\nTurn 16: from (1,5), move U to (1,6), no food (assuming no food there).\n\nAfter move: head to (1,6), B1 to old H (1,5), B2 to old B1 (2,5), B3 to old B2 (2,6), tail to old B3 (3,6)\n\nPositions: head (1,6), B1 (1,5), B2 (2,5), B3 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nHead direction up.\n\nThen from (1,6), last move U, so cannot D.\n\nMoves: U to (1,7) wall invalid, D invalid, L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6) - (2,6) is occupied by B3? Positions: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), so (2,6) has B3, not tail, so moving there would collision.\n\nR to (2,6) is body, not free, so invalid.\n\nL invalid, U invalid, D invalid, only R but blocked, so stuck! Dead end.\n\nIf at turn 16 from (1,5), if I go U to (1,6), I have no valid moves, because all directions blocked or occupied.\n\nU wall, D invalid (opposite or not, last move U, so D is opposite, invalid anyway), L wall, R occupied by body.\n\nSo no move, die.\n\nTherefore, in option A, after eating at (2,5), on turn 16 from (1,5), I must go D to (1,4) to eat, otherwise if I go U, I die immediately.\n\nSo only choice is to go D to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut from (1,3) to (2,3), then I can go to other areas.\n\nBut the food at (1,4) is eaten early.\n\nNow, option B at turn 14: move L to (1,6), no eat, length 4.\n\nTurn 14: move to (1,6), positions: head (1,6), B1 (2,6), B2 (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 15: only possible move D to (1,5), no food there (since (2,5) vanished).\n\nAfter move: head to (1,5), B1 to old H (1,6), B2 to old B1 (2,6), tail to old B2 (3,6)\n\nPositions: head (1,5), B1 (1,6), B2 (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 16: from (1,5), last move D, so can move D, L, R (cannot U).\n\n- D: (1,4) - has food\n\n- L: (0,5) wall invalid\n\n- R: (2,5) - free? Not occupied, not wall, free and empty\n\nSo can go D to (1,4) to eat, or R to (2,5) empty.\n\nIf go D to (1,4), eat, grow to 5. Head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen similar to before, must go to (1,3) next, etc.\n\nIf go R to (2,5), no eat, head to (2,5), direction R.\n\nThen positions: head (2,5), B1 (1,5), B2 (1,6), tail (2,6) — after move to (2,5): head (2,5), B1 to old H (1,5), B2 to old B1 (1,6), tail to old B2 (2,6)\n\nSo positions: head (2,5), B1 (1,5), B2 (1,6), tail (2,6)\n\nNow head at (2,5), last move right.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, R? Cannot L, opposite.\n\n- U: (2,6) - but (2,6) is tail! Now, tail is at (2,6), and I can move to tail cell because it will move.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (2,6) is allowed, because it's the tail.\n\n- D: (2,4) - but (2,4) obstacle, invalid\n\n- R: (3,5) - (3,5) obstacle, invalid\n\n- L: not allowed\n\nSo only U to (2,6), the tail.\n\nMove to (2,6), which is current tail position.\n\nAfter move: head to (2,6), but (2,6) was tail, so when head moves there, since it's the tail, no collision, and tail moves away.\n\nPositions before move: head (2,5), B1 (1,5), B2 (1,6), T (2,6)\n\nMove to (2,6): head to (2,6), then B1 moves to old head (2,5), B2 moves to old B1 (1,5), tail moves to old B2 (1,6)\n\nSo new positions: head (2,6), B1 (2,5), B2 (1,5), tail (1,6)\n\nNo eat, so length same.\n\nHead at (2,6), last move up (from (2,5) to (2,6), y increased, so up.\n\nThen from (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L? Cannot R, opposite? Last move U, so cannot D (opposite).\n\n- U: (2,7) wall invalid\n\n- D: (2,5) - but (2,5) is now B1, body segment, not tail. Tail is at (1,6), so (2,5) is body, moving there would collision.\n\n- L: (1,6) - (1,6) is tail! Positions: head (2,6), B1 (2,5), B2 (1,5), T (1,6)\n\nSo (1,6) is tail, so I can move to (1,6).\n\n- R: not allowed\n\nSo can move L to (1,6), the tail.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut this is wandering.\n\nBack to turn 16 choice.\n\nIn option B, at turn 16 from (1,5), I can choose to eat (1,4) or go to (2,5).\n\nIf I eat (1,4), I grow, but then I'm at (1,4) with limited moves, similar to before.\n\nIf I go to (2,5), then I can go up to (2,6) or other, but (2,6) might be available.\n\nBut let's think about the long-term food at (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is at bottom right.\n\nFrom current position, to reach (6,3), I need to go right and down, but there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), if I can go right, but (3,6) is body or something.\n\nInitially, at turn 14, snake at (2,6),(3,6),etc, so (3,6) occupied.\n\nBut if I don't eat, the tail moves.\n\nIn option B, after moving to (1,5) on turn 15, positions head (1,5), B1 (1,6), B2 (2,6), T (3,6)\n\nThen at turn 16, if I go R to (2,5), then positions head (2,5), B1 (1,5), B2 (1,6), T (2,6) — as before.\n\nThen I can move U to (2,6), which is tail, so allowed, head to (2,6), then B1 to (2,5), B2 to (1,5), T to (1,6)\n\nHead at (2,6), last move U.\n\nThen I can move L to (1,6), tail, head to (1,6), then B1 to (2,6), B2 to (2,5), T to (1,5)\n\nAnd so on. I'm looping around (1,5),(1,6),(2,5),(2,6) but with the body, it might get messy.\n\nFor example, from head at (2,6), move L to (1,6), which is tail, so head to (1,6), then B1 to (2,6), B2 to (2,5), T to (1,5)\n\nPositions: head (1,6), B1 (2,6), B2 (2,5), T (1,5)\n\nThen from (1,6), last move L, can move U, D, L? Cannot R.\n\nU wall, D to (1,5) but (1,5) is tail, so can move, etc.\n\nBut eventually, I need to go down to access (1,4) or other areas.\n\nThe food at (1,4) is still there with life span decreasing.\n\nBut if I keep moving around here, I might miss it or get stuck.\n\nTo reach (6,3), I need to move right.\n\nBut there are obstacles at (3,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), if I could go right, but (3,6) is occupied initially.\n\nAfter some moves, (3,6) might be free.\n\nIn option B, at turn 16, if from (1,5) I go R to (2,5), then U to (2,6), then L to (1,6), then from (1,6) I can only go D to (1,5), but (1,5) is now body or tail.\n\nLet's not simulate all.\n\nPerhaps not eating the immediate food at (2,5) gives more flexibility.\n\nBut if I don't eat it, I miss the point, and it's gone.\n\nBut there is other food.\n\nSince the food at (2,5) has only 1 turn left, if I don't eat it, I lose it, but eating it might force me into a corner.\n\nBut in the path where I eat it, I can still survive by going down to (1,4) and then to (1,3), etc.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go to (2,3), then to (3,3), etc., to reach the right side.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), after moving R to (2,3), head at (2,3), last move R.\n\nThen moves: U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid; D to (2,2) free?; L to (1,3) but just came from, or opposite; last move R, so cannot L.\n\nCan move U, D, R? Cannot L opposite.\n\nU to (2,4) obstacle, invalid; D to (2,2) free; R to (3,3) free? Not obstacle.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nSo can go D or R.\n\nIf go R to (3,3), then to (4,3), but there is obstacle at (3,5), but (3,3) is different.\n\nThen I can go down to (3,2), etc., towards (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, the food at (6,3) is there for 9 turns, so I have time.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4), etc.\n\n(6,3) is at x=6,y=3, not obstacle.\n\nTo reach it, I need to navigate around obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I can go to (4,3), (5,3), but (5,3) is free? Obstacles are (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), so (5,3) free.\n\nThen (6,3) is food.\n\nBut (6,3) has y=3, x=6, but x=6 is border? Border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=3 not wall.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable, except obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so min x=1, max x=6 for movable cells? Coordinates: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so snake can be at x=1 to x=6.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to y=6.\n\nFor example, (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, which is not wall, but since x=6, it's adjacent to wall x=7, but the cell is free.\n\nSimilarly, internal obstacles.\n\n(6,3) is food, not obstacle.\n\nSo it's reachable.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nIf I eat at (2,5) on turn 14, I grow, but I'm forced to eat at (1,4) soon, growing more, but then I'm in bottom left with fewer options.\n\nIf I don't eat at (2,5), I stay smaller, can move to (1,5), then I have choice to eat (1,4) or go to (2,5) empty.\n\nIf I eat (1,4) later, I grow, but similar position.\n\nBut by not eating (2,5), I avoid being forced to (1,5) immediately, and I can perhaps go down later or right.\n\nAt turn 14, if I move L to (1,6), then D to (1,5), then at turn 16, I can go R to (2,5) instead of down.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) if tail, etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can go right from there.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), after moving to it, head at (2,5), then I can only go U to (2,6) if it's tail, which it might be.\n\nIn the sequence, it can be.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go R to (3,6) if free.\n\nIn option B, at turn 15, positions after move to (1,5): head (1,5), B1 (1,6), B2 (2,6), T (3,6)\n\nThen turn 16, move R to (2,5): head (2,5), B1 (1,5), B2 (1,6), T (2,6)  -- T at (2,6)\n\nThen turn 17, move U to (2,6): head to (2,6), B1 to (2,5), B2 to (1,5), T to (1,6)\n\nPositions: head (2,6), B1 (2,5), B2 (1,5), T (1,6)\n\nThen turn 18, move L to (1,6): head to (1,6), B1 to (2,6), B2 to (2,5), T to (1,5)\n\nPositions: head (1,6), B1 (2,6), B2 (2,5), T (1,5)\n\nThen from (1,6), last move L, can move U wall, D to (1,5) but (1,5) is tail, so can move to (1,5).\n\nMove D to (1,5): head to (1,5), B1 to (1,6), B2 to (2,6), T to (2,5)\n\nPositions: head (1,5), B1 (1,6), B2 (2,6), T (2,5)\n\nNow head at (1,5), last move D.\n\nThen can move D to (1,4) to eat food, or L wall, or R to (2,5) but (2,5) is tail, so can move.\n\nIf I move D to (1,4), eat, grow.\n\nOr move R to (2,5), tail.\n\nBut the food at (1,4) is there, life span decreasing.\n\nIf I don't eat it soon, I might lose it.\n\nLife span at turn 14 is 6, so by turn 19 it's gone.\n\nAfter turn 14, life 5, turn 15 life 4, etc., so on turn 19, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nSo I have a few turns.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (6,3) for later.\n\nBut in this path, I can choose to eat (1,4) at turn 18 or 19.\n\nBut let's think about the initial choice.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, not eating the risky food at (2,5) is better, but it's not risky, it's safe to eat, but it commits me.\n\nBut if I eat it, I grow, which might be good for score, but I need to survive.\n\nIn the eat path, after eating (2,5) and then (1,4), I have length 6, and I'm at (1,3) or something, then I can move to (2,3), then to (3,3), etc., to reach (6,3).\n\nFor example, from (1,3), go R to (2,3), then R to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then R to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut there are obstacles, like (5,2) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), then R to (6,3) to eat.\n\n(5,3) is free, no obstacle, then (6,3) food.\n\nSo possible.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, I can do similar.\n\nBut by not eating (2,5), I have the same options later, but I missed one food.\n\nIf I eat (2,5), I get +1 now, and can get (1,4) later.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5), I miss +1, but can get (1,4) later.\n\nSo net, eating (2,5) gives one more point.\n\nAnd survival is possible in both cases.\n\nIn the eat path, after growing, I have more body, which might block, but in this case, the grid has space.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) with length 6, positions might be head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) or something, but when I move to (2,3), the tail moves, so positions change.\n\nBut I can still navigate.\n\nPerhaps it's fine to eat the food.\n\nBut let's check the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, at (2,5), if I move down, head to (2,5), and if the tail is adjacent, but tail is at (4,5), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think it's better to eat the food at (2,5) since it will disappear, and I can still survive and eat other food.\n\nMoreover, the food at (1,4) has longer life, so I can eat it later.\n\nIn the sequence, if I eat at (2,5), I am forced to eat at (1,4) soon, which is good.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5), I can eat (1,4) later at my convenience.\n\nBut since (1,4) has life 6, I can delay, but why delay? Eating sooner might be better to grow and have more space.\n\nBut with obstacles, smaller snake might be more maneuverable.\n\nBut in this case, length 4 vs 5 or 6, not big difference.\n\nI think eating the immediate food is fine.\n\nBut to be safe, let's see if there is a reason not to.\n\nAnother point: the food at (2,5) is under the body? No, initially, snake is at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), so (2,5) is below head, not under body.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here it's not, it's free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think for turn 14, move D to (2,5).\n\nThen for turn 15, only choice is L to (1,5).\n\nThen for turn 16, from (1,5), I must move D to (1,4) to eat, because if I go U, I die, as earlier.\n\nThen turn 17, from (1,4) move D to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 18, from (1,3) move R to (2,3), since only choice.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 14.\n\nAnswer format: for turn t1=14, then t1+1, etc., for several turns.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and prioritize survival, I should plan a path to eat the foods.\n\nBut for now, at turn 14, move D to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 15: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 16: move D to (1,4) eat\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: move R to (2,3)\n\nThen from (2,3), last move R, so can move U, D, R? Cannot L.\n\nU to (2,4) obstacle, invalid; D to (2,2) free; R to (3,3) free.\n\nSo can go D or R.\n\nIf I go R to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc. towards (6,3).\n\nSince (6,3) has life 9, I have time.\n\nBut I need to output actions.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns, I can specify.\n\nSince the food at (2,5) must be eaten now or lost, and it's safe, I'll go for it.\n\nSo for turn 14: move D\n\nThen turn 15: move L\n\nTurn 16: move D\n\nBut turn 16 is from (1,5) to (1,4), which is down.\n\nThen turn 17: from (1,4) to (1,3), down.\n\nTurn 18: from (1,3) to (2,3), right.\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nTo reach (6,3), I should go right.\n\nMove R to (3,3).\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3) move R to (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output up to 5 turns or so.\n\nThe state is at turn 14, so output from turn 14 to, say, turn 18 or 19.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps I should include the food at (1,4) in the plan.\n\nIn this path, I eat it on turn 16.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5), I can eat (1,4) later, but I might not gain more.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nFinal decision: move D on turn 14.\n\nThen for the output, I need to specify multiple turns, but since future depends, I can plan a few.\n\nBut the AI should decide based on state, but for answer, I need to output actions for t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: 14 to 18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nFrom turn 18, at (2,3), move R to (3,3)\n\nBut turn 18 is from (1,3) to (2,3), so last move R.\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,3) move R to (3,3)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut for the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, I need to avoid them.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move R to (4,3)\n\nThen to (5,3)\n\nThen to (6,3) to eat.\n\n(5,3) is free, no obstacle.\n\nObstacles are (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), so (5,3) ok.\n\nSimilarly (6,3) food.\n\nBut on turn 14, (6,3) life 9, so by turn 23 or so.\n\nIn my path, turn 14 to 18, I'm at (2,3), then turn 19 to (3,3), turn 20 to (4,3), turn 21 to (5,3), turn 22 to (6,3) eat.\n\nLife span at turn 14 is 9, so after turn 14, 8; turn 15,7; ... turn 22: after 8 turns, life span 1 at turn 21? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 14, life span 9, so it exists from turn 14 to turn 22 inclusive? Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 14, life span 9, after turn 14, life span 8, ..., after turn 22, life span 0, so on turn 23 it disappears. So on turn 22, it is still there with life span 1.\n\nI can eat on turn 22.\n\nIn my plan, I can reach on turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (1,4) is eaten on turn 16.\n\nSo I get two foods.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5), I get only (1,4) and (6,3), but miss one, so score lower.\n\nTherefore, better to eat both.\n\nSo I think move D on turn 14 is best.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned multiple turns ahead (5+ turns). The key considerations are:\n- The food at (2,5) has a life span of 1, meaning it must be eaten on turn 14 or it disappears. Eating it gives +1 score and increases snake length by 1.\n- Moving down to (2,5) is safe and allows eating this food, but it forces a specific path due to surrounding obstacles and walls.\n- After eating, the snake grows, which could increase collision risks, but the planned path avoids immediate dangers.\n- The food at (1,4) has a life span of 6 (5 turns after turn 14) and must be eaten soon, but not immediately. It can be safely eaten on turn 16 in this plan.\n- The food at (6,3) has a life span of 9 (8 turns after turn 14), so there is time to navigate toward it later.\n- Internal obstacles and walls limit movement, so the path must avoid: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4), and all borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n- Survival is prioritized; the plan ensures no collisions or dead ends for at least 5 turns.\n\n### Plan Details (Turns 14-18):\n- **Turn 14**: Move down (D) to (2,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score). This is safe as (2,5) is free and not under the body. Snake grows to length 5. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 15**: Move left (L) to (1,5). This is the only valid move from (2,5) (down and right are blocked by obstacles/walls). No food, so length unchanged. Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 16**: Move down (D) to (1,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score). This is safe and necessary, as moving up would cause a dead end. Snake grows to length 6. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 17**: Move down (D) to (1,3). Only valid move (left is wall, right is blocked by obstacle at (2,4)). No food, length unchanged. Head direction remains D.\n- **Turn 18**: Move right (R) to (2,3). Only valid move (up is blocked by obstacle at (2,4), down leads to obstacle at (1,2) but can be avoided later). No food, length unchanged. Head direction becomes R.\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats two foods (at (2,5) and (1,4)) by turn 16, gaining +2 score early. The food at (6,3) can be targeted later (life span allows until turn 22).\n- **Survival Focus**: Avoids all collisions and dead ends:\n  - Turn 14: Moving down avoids walls and body collisions.\n  - Turn 15: Moving left is forced but safe.\n  - Turn 16: Moving down eats food and avoids death (moving up would trap the snake with no valid moves).\n  - Turns 17-18: Down then right navigates away from the bottom-left corner safely.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: After turn 18, the snake can head toward (6,3) by moving right to (3,3), (4,3), etc., avoiding obstacles. With the snake at (2,3) on turn 18, the path to (6,3) is clear and can be reached by turn 22 without risk.\n- **Missed Opportunity**: Not eating (2,5) on turn 14 loses +1 score permanently and may not provide better long-term options. Eating it commits to a path but ensures higher score and survival.\n\n### Answer Format:\nThe actions for turns 14 to 18 are below. Beyond turn 18, the snake should continue toward (6,3) for additional score, but this is not included as the plan is fixed for the first 5 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: D (down)  \nTurn 15: L (left)  \nTurn 16: D (down)  \nTurn 17: D (down)  \nTurn 18: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 15, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I have to avoid internal obstacles too.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is Down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, I assume. In coordinates, D is (x, y-1), so from (2,5), moving down would go to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,4) is an obstacle? Let's check: obstacles include (2,4), which is listed. So (2,4) is blocked. Also, head direction is D, so current direction is down.\n\nFood: two items:\n\n- (1,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (1,4), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including this one, so it will be gone after turn 19? Let's see: current turn is 15, life span 5, so it decreases each turn, including turn 15, so after turn 15, life span becomes 4, then 3,2,1, and after turn 19, it disappears. Similarly for (6,3), life span 8, disappears after turn 22.\n\nBut we need to think about actions for multiple turns ahead.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions starting from turn 15 onwards, but since the future depends on what I do, I have to plan a sequence.\n\nThe answer format should be a sequence of actions for several turns, like Turn 15: action, Turn 16: action, etc. But it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 moves, but since the state changes, I need to simulate.\n\nThe snake moves each turn, and food life spans decrease.\n\nAlso, I have to avoid walls and body collisions, but since the tail moves, I can go to where the tail is, as long as it's not occupied after the move.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, minus obstacles.\n\nObstacles:\n\n- (6,4) - so (6,4) blocked\n\n- (5,1) - blocked\n\n- (2,4) - blocked\n\n- (6,1) - blocked\n\n- (1,2) - blocked\n\n- (5,6) - blocked\n\n- (5,2) - blocked\n\n- (3,5) - blocked\n\n(3,5) is blocked, but snake head is at (2,5), which is fine.\n\nSnake: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So the body segments are at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is the tail? Positions: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5). So tail is (4,5).\n\nCurrent direction is D, so from (2,5), moving down would be to (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move down. It's a wall or obstacle, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving left: x decreases, so from (2,5) to (1,5). Is (1,5) blocked? Obstacles include (1,2), but (1,5) is not listed, so it should be free? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, y=0,y=7, so x=1 is not a wall, it's playable unless obstacle. Obstacles: (1,2) is blocked, but (1,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, right: to (3,5), but (3,5) is an obstacle, listed as (3,5).\n\nUp: from (2,5) to (2,6), but (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake body. Moving to a body segment: if it's not the tail, it's deadly. But (2,6) is the second segment, not the tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nTail is at (4,5), so only that cell might be safe to move to if it's moving away.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- U: (2,6) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- D: (2,4) - obstacle, collision\n\n- L: (1,5) - seems free? Let's confirm.\n\nAvailable cells: (1,5) - x=1,y=5, not a border wall (border is x=0,7; y=0,7), and not in obstacle list: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). (1,5) not there, so free.\n\nR: (3,5) - obstacle, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (1,5)? But current direction is D, and I need to consider no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, moving up would be reverse? Let's see.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, down. So moving up would be opposite to current direction. But no instant reverse means I cannot move directly opposite on the next turn. So from D, I cannot move U immediately.\n\nDirections: U is up, y+1; D is down, y-1; L is left, x-1; R is right, x+1.\n\nCurrent direction D: down, so opposite is U, up.\n\nSo I cannot move U because it's reverse and also because (2,6) is occupied.\n\nI cannot move D to (2,4) because obstacle.\n\nI cannot move R to (3,5) because obstacle.\n\nOnly possible is L to (1,5).\n\nAnd since current direction is D, moving L is not opposite, so it should be allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse only prevents moving opposite, but L is perpendicular, so fine.\n\nSo for turn 15, I must move L to (1,5).\n\nIs that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5).\n\nAfter moving to (1,5), the head moves to (1,5), and the body follows: the segment that was at (2,6) moves to (2,5), but (2,5) was head, now it's body, and so on. Tail (4,5) moves to where? Let's see the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So after moving left to (1,5):\n\n- New head: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 1: was at (2,6), now moves to where head was, (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2: was at (3,6), now moves to (2,6)\n\n- Segment 3: was at (4,6), now moves to (3,6)\n\n- Segment 4 (tail): was at (4,5), now moves to (4,6)? No.\n\nThe body segments follow: the first body segment moves to the old head position, which is (2,5). Second body segment moves to the old position of first, which was (2,6), and so on.\n\nPositions before move:\n\nIndex 0: head (2,5)\n\nIndex 1: body (2,6)\n\nIndex 2: body (3,6)\n\nIndex 3: body (4,6)\n\nIndex 4: tail (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,5):\n\n- New head: (1,5)\n\n- New body segment 1: old head position (2,5)\n\n- New body segment 2: old position of segment 1, which was (2,6)\n\n- New body segment 3: old position of segment 2, which was (3,6)\n\n- New tail: old position of segment 3, which was (4,6)\n\nThe tail was segment 4, which was at (4,5), but since segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, which is (3,6), and segment 4 (tail) moves to where segment 3 was, which is (4,6). So tail moves to (4,6).\n\nThe position (4,5) is now empty, since tail moved away.\n\nNow, food at (1,4) and (6,3).\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), which is below (1,5)? y decreases down, so (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n\nSince we moved to (1,5), and food is at (1,4), which is adjacent.\n\nBut we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFor turn 15, I have to move, and only L is possible, so I must move L to (1,5).\n\nThen, for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: border, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo free cells: all except these.\n\nNow snake positions: after move to (1,5), snake will be at: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nHead at (1,5), direction now L? Since I moved left, new head direction is L.\n\nNow, from (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,6) - y=6, is it free? y=6 is within 1-6, not wall. Obstacles: (5,6) is blocked, but (1,6) not listed, so free. Also, not occupied by snake? Current snake after move: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So (1,6) is not occupied, free.\n\n- D: to (1,4) - this has food! (1,4) is a food position with value 1. But I need to see if I can eat it. If I move down to (1,4), and it's food, I eat it, snake grows.\n\n- L: to (0,5) - but x=0 is wall, collision, cannot.\n\n- R: to (2,5) - but (2,5) is now occupied by the body (after move, it's segment 1), so moving there would be collision with body.\n\nAfter move to (1,5), positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nBody: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied, so moving right to (2,5) is not possible, collision.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,4) is free, and has food.\n\nUp to (1,6) free.\n\nLeft to (0,5) wall, not possible.\n\nSo from (1,5), possible moves: U or D.\n\nNow, D has food at (1,4).\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (4,6), not adjacent to (1,5), so no issue.\n\nNow, if I move D to (1,4), I eat the food, so snake grows to 6 segments. After eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head to (1,4), and body segments: the previous head (1,5) becomes body, then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail stays since growth, so tail is still at (4,6)? Let's see.\n\nWhen you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move, but a new segment is added.\n\nSo before move: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nAfter moving down to (1,4) and eating food:\n\n- New head: (1,4)\n\n- New body segments: (1,5) (previous head), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\n- And since ate food, add new segment at previous tail position (4,6), but (4,6) is already occupied? No, the tail was at (4,6), and we add a new segment there, so now there are two segments at (4,6)? That can't be.\n\nI think I have it wrong.\n\nStandard snake: when you move without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n\nWhen you eat, head moves to food cell, the segment that was tail stays, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added, so snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: after moving to food, the new head is at food cell, then the previous head position is now body, and all body segments shift, but the tail remains, so the cell that was tail is still occupied, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nBefore move: positions: let's say S0, S1, S2, ..., Stail\n\nAfter moving to a non-food cell: new head at new position, new S1 at old S0, new S2 at old S1, ..., new Stail at old second last.\n\nAfter moving to food cell: new head at food, new S1 at old S0 (previous head), new S2 at old S1, ..., and the tail doesn't move, so new Stail at old Stail position, and since we ate, we add an extra segment, so the new tail is the old Stail, and a new segment is added at the old Stail position, meaning the snake has one more segment.\n\nIn terms of positions: after eating, the body includes all the previous positions plus the tail stays, so the tail cell is still occupied, and the new tail is the same as before.\n\nFor example, before: head at H, body B1, B2, ..., Bk (tail)\n\nAfter moving to food F:\n\n- New head: F\n\n- New body: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk (tail)\n\nSince ate food, the snake grows, so the segment that was tail Bk is still the tail, and no new position is added immediately; the growth is that the tail doesn't move, so the length increases.\n\nAfter move to non-food: positions become: new head, old head, old B1, ..., old B_{k-1}, so tail moved to old B_{k-1}.\n\nAfter move to food: positions become: new head (F), old head (H), old B1, old B2, ..., old Bk (tail), so the tail is still at old Bk, and since we ate, the snake is longer by one cell, which is the tail position staying.\n\nIn this case, before moving to (1,4): positions (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nAfter moving down to (1,4) and eating food:\n\nNew positions: head at (1,4), then body at (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and tail at (4,6) -- so snake now has 6 segments: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nYes.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAt turn 15, I must move L to (1,5), as it's the only choice.\n\nThen at turn 16, from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4) to eat the food.\n\nIf I eat the food at (1,4), I get +1 and grow, but I need to think long-term.\n\nThere's another food at (6,3) with longer life span.\n\nBut (1,4) has life span 5, current turn 15, so after turn 15, it has life span 4 left? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 15, for food at (1,4), life span is 5, meaning it will be present for 5 more turns including this one? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) - Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (1,4), life span 5 at turn 15, so at turn 15, life span 5, after turn 15, it decreases to 4, then 3,2,1, and after turn 19, it disappears (so not present on turn 20).\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) life span 8 at turn 15, disappears after turn 22.\n\nNow at turn 16, from (1,5), if I move D to (1,4), I eat it immediately.\n\nBut I should consider if it's safe or if there are better options.\n\nFirst, let's list the sequence starting from turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: only possible move is L to (1,5). Action: L\n\nAfter this, snake at: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  -- head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nNow turn 16: from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I move D to (1,4), I eat the food, snake grows to 6 segments: positions (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) -- head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen from there, where to go?\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,5) - but (1,5) is occupied by body (segment after head), so collision\n\n- D: to (1,3) - is it free? y=3, x=1, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles include (1,2), not (1,3)), and not occupied, so free.\n\n- L: to (0,4) - x=0 wall, not possible\n\n- R: to (2,4) - but (2,4) is obstacle, listed, so collision.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,3).\n\nThen I have to move there.\n\nBut after eating, I'm at (1,4), and only down to (1,3) is possible.\n\nThen from (1,3), etc.\n\nBut I might get stuck.\n\nIf at turn 16 I move U to (1,6) instead of eating immediately.\n\nFrom (1,5), move U to (1,6).\n\nThen no food, so snake moves: head to (1,6), body to (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) -- tail was (4,6), but moved to (3,6)? Positions after move:\n\nBefore move: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nMove U to (1,6):\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nNew body: (1,5) (old head), (2,5) (old body1), (2,6) (old body2), (3,6) (old body3, now tail) -- and tail (4,6) is left, so new tail is (3,6)\n\nSnake: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nHead at (1,6), direction U.\n\nNow from here, I can move to other places.\n\nFood at (1,4) is still there, but I didn't eat it.\n\nLife span of (1,4) decreases to 4 at turn 16? After turn 15, it was decreased, but let's keep track.\n\nTurn 15: food (1,4) life span 5\n\nAfter turn 15, it decreases to 4 for turn 16.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 16, if I move to (1,6), not eating, so life span becomes 3 for turn 17, etc.\n\nBut I can go back down to eat it later, but I need to see if possible.\n\nFrom (1,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,7) - but y=7 is wall, collision, cannot\n\n- D: to (1,5) - but (1,5) is occupied by body, collision\n\n- L: to (0,6) - x=0 wall, cannot\n\n- R: to (2,6) - (2,6) is occupied by body? Current snake: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\n(2,6) is the fourth segment, so occupied, moving there would collide.\n\nOnly possible moves? U, D, L, R all seem blocked or occupied.\n\nU to (1,7) wall\n\nD to (1,5) occupied\n\nL to (0,6) wall\n\nR to (2,6) occupied by body segment.\n\n(2,6) is part of the snake, so I cannot move there unless it's the tail and I'm moving to it as it moves away.\n\nBut here, (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (3,6).\n\nAnd since I'm moving to (2,6), which will be occupied after the move? But at the time of move, it is occupied, so collision.\n\nTherefore, from (1,6), no possible moves! All directions are invalid.\n\nThat means if I move U to (1,6) at turn 16, I get stuck and die on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving U at turn 16 is not possible; it leads to death.\n\nSo the only choice at turn 16 is to move D to (1,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen, as before, after eating, at (1,4), I must move D to (1,3) at turn 17.\n\nNow, turn 17: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n\nAfter move: head to (1,3), body to (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) -- and since ate food at turn 16, the tail didn't move, so positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nSnake length 6.\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D.\n\nNow from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,4) - occupied by body (first segment), collision\n\n- D: to (1,2) - but (1,2) is obstacle, listed, so collision\n\n- L: to (0,3) - x=0 wall, cannot\n\n- R: to (2,3) - is it free? x=2,y=3, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not listed), not occupied, so free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,3).\n\nAction: R\n\nTurn 17: move R to (2,3)\n\nNew head: (2,3), direction R? Since moved right.\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) -- tail was (3,6), but moved to (2,6)? After move, body segments: old head (1,3) becomes body, old body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), and tail moves to old position of second last? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) -- head (1,3), tail (3,6)\n\nMove to (2,3):\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nNew body: (1,3) (old head), (1,4) (old body1), (1,5) (old body2), (2,5) (old body3), (2,6) (old body4, now tail) -- and old tail (3,6) is left, so new tail is (2,6)\n\nSnake: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nHead at (2,3), direction R.\n\nNow turn 18: from (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,4) - but (2,4) is obstacle, collision\n\n- D: to (2,2) - y=2, free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles: (1,2), (5,2), etc., (2,2) not listed), not occupied, so free.\n\n- L: to (1,3) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: to (3,3) - free? x=3,y=3, not obstacle, not occupied.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nNow, I need to think about the other food at (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is at x=6,y=3, which is on the right.\n\nCurrently at (2,3), I can move towards it.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid.\n\nI should plan to reach (6,3) safely.\n\nAlso, tail is at (2,6), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), then from there I can go further right.\n\nOr D to (2,2), then I might go down.\n\nBut (2,2) is free, but below is (2,1), but y=1, and (5,1) obstacle, but (2,1) should be free? Obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), but (2,1) not listed, so free.\n\nBut let's think multiple steps.\n\nMoreover, I need to maximize score, so eating (6,3) is good.\n\nLife span 8, so it will be around until turn 22, current turn 18? Turn 15,16,17,18 so turn 18, life span of (6,3) was 8 at turn 15, decreased each turn, so at turn 18, life span = 8 - (18-15) = 3? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 15, life span 8, so after turn 15, life span 7 for turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: life span 7, after decrease, 6 for turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: 6, decrease to 5 for turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: 5, decrease to 4 for turn 19, etc. Disappears after turn 22.\n\nAt turn 18, life span 5, so still time.\n\nNow from (2,3), if I move R to (3,3), that might be better to go right.\n\n(3,3) is free, as we said.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to (4,3) or other.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,5), but we are at (3,3).\n\nLet me list possible paths to (6,3).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (6,3), I need to go right.\n\nBut obstacles: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4), etc.\n\nSpecifically, from (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is safe.\n\nThen from (3,3), possible moves:\n\nU: (3,4) - is it free? (3,4) not listed obstacle, and not occupied. But (3,5) is obstacle, but (3,4) ok.\n\nD: (3,2) - free? Not listed.\n\nL: (2,3) - occupied by body? After moving to (3,3), positions: let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 18, if I move R to (3,3):\n\nCurrent before move: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nMove to (3,3):\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew body: (2,3) (old head), (1,3) (old body1), (1,4) (old body2), (1,5) (old body3), (2,5) (old body4, now tail) -- tail moves to (2,5)\n\nSnake: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nHead at (3,3), direction R.\n\nNow turn 19: from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,4) - free, not occupied\n\n- D: to (3,2) - free\n\n- L: to (2,3) - occupied by body (first segment), collision\n\n- R: to (4,3) - free? x=4,y=3, not obstacle, yes.\n\nSo possible: U, D, or R.\n\nNow, (6,3) is at (6,3), so I should move towards it, so R to (4,3) is direct.\n\nMove R to (4,3).\n\nThen similarly, continue.\n\nBut let's see if there are obstacles in the way.\n\nFrom (4,3), to (5,3), then to (6,3).\n\n(5,3): is it free? Not obstacle, obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(6,3) is the food, but when I reach it, I need to eat.\n\n(6,3) has obstacle? No, food is at (6,3), which is not listed as obstacle, so free.\n\nBut (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is different.\n\nNow, from (3,3), if I move R to (4,3) at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: move R to (4,3)\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew body: (3,3) (old head), (2,3) (old body1), (1,3) (old body2), (1,4) (old body3), (1,5) (old body4, now tail) -- tail at (1,5)? Positions: after move, body segments: old head (3,3), old body1 (2,3), old body2 (1,3), old body3 (1,4), old body4 (1,5) now tail.\n\nSnake: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nHead at (4,3), direction R.\n\nNow turn 20: from (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,4) - free? Not obstacle, not occupied.\n\n- D: to (4,2) - free? Not obstacle.\n\n- L: to (3,3) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: to (5,3) - free, as above.\n\nSo possible: U, D, R.\n\nI can move R to (5,3) to get closer to (6,3).\n\nMove R to (5,3).\n\nTurn 20: move R to (5,3)\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nNew body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) -- tail was (1,5), moved to (1,4)? After move: new head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4)\n\nSnake: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nHead at (5,3), direction R.\n\nNow turn 21: from (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,4) - free? Not obstacle.\n\n- D: to (5,2) - but (5,2) is obstacle, listed, collision\n\n- L: to (4,3) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: to (6,3) - which is food! And free, not obstacle.\n\nSo I can move R to (6,3) to eat the food.\n\nTurn 21: move R to (6,3), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows to 7 segments.\n\nAfter eating: head at (6,3), body at (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail at (1,4) -- since tail stays.\n\nNow, from there, I need to find a safe place.\n\nBut first, let's list the actions so far.\n\nWe started from turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: move L to (1,5) -- only choice.\n\nTurn 16: move D to (1,4) to eat food -- only choice to avoid death.\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3) -- only choice? From (1,4), only D to (1,3), then R to (2,3) at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: from (1,3) moved R to (2,3)\n\nAt turn 18, from (2,3), I had choices: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nIn my earlier plan, I chose R to (3,3) to go to the food.\n\nBut I could have gone down, but going right is better to reach (6,3).\n\nThen turn 19: from (3,3) move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 20: from (4,3) move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 21: from (5,3) move R to (6,3) eat food.\n\nNow, what about turn 22 and beyond? I need to think about survival after eating.\n\nBut the food at (6,3) is eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, after eating at (6,3), head at (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail at (1,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (6,4) - but (6,4) is obstacle! Listed, so collision\n\n- D: to (6,2) - free? Not obstacle, not occupied. Obstacles: (6,1), (6,4), so (6,2) ok.\n\n- L: to (5,3) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: to (7,3) - x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,2).\n\nTurn 22: move D to (6,2)\n\nThen head to (6,2), direction D.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), body (6,3) (old head), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) -- tail was (1,4), but moved? After move: since not eating, tail moves.\n\nBefore move: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4)\n\nMove to (6,2):\n\nNew head: (6,2)\n\nNew body: (6,3) (old head), (5,3) (old body1), (4,3) (old body2), (3,3) (old body3), (2,3) (old body4), (1,3) (old body5, now tail) -- and old tail (1,4) left, so new tail is (1,3)\n\nSnake: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nHead at (6,2), direction D.\n\nNow from (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (6,3) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- D: to (6,1) - but (6,1) is obstacle, listed, collision\n\n- L: to (5,2) - (5,2) is obstacle, collision\n\n- R: to (7,2) - x=7 wall, cannot\n\nAll moves are invalid! Stuck and die.\n\nOh no, problem.\n\nAt turn 22, after moving to (6,2), I have no moves.\n\nBut I must move, so I die.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (6,3) leads to death shortly after.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I should not go directly to (6,3) but find a safer path.\n\nAt turn 18, from (2,3), instead of moving R to (3,3), I could move D to (2,2).\n\nThen I might have more space.\n\nLet's try that alternative.\n\nBack to turn 18, at (2,3), after moving from (1,3) at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: moved R to (2,3), positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) -- head (2,3), tail (2,6)\n\nAt turn 18, move D to (2,2)\n\nThen new head: (2,2)\n\nNew body: (2,3) (old head), (1,3) (old body1), (1,4) (old body2), (1,5) (old body3), (2,5) (old body4, now tail) -- tail at (2,5)\n\nSnake: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nHead at (2,2), direction D.\n\nNow from (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,3) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- D: to (2,1) - free? Not obstacle, not occupied. (2,1) should be free.\n\n- L: to (1,2) - but (1,2) is obstacle, collision\n\n- R: to (3,2) - free? Not obstacle.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2)\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), then I can go towards (6,3) but via bottom.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\nThen from (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (6,3) is at y=3, so I need to go up later.\n\nAlso, at (2,2), I could move D to (2,1), but y=1, and (5,1) obstacle, but (2,1) ok.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (6,3) safely.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat both foods if it leads to trap.\n\nBut (1,4) was eaten at turn 16, so I have to deal with it.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 16, when at (1,5), I had to move D to (1,4) to avoid death, no choice.\n\nThen at turn 17, from (1,4) moved D to (1,3)\n\nThen at turn 18, from (1,3) but after turn 17 I am at (1,3)? Turn 17: from (1,4) moved D to (1,3), so at (1,3)\n\nIn turn 18, from (1,3), I moved to (2,3)? No, at turn 17 I moved to (1,3), then turn 18 from (1,3) or (2,3)?\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nTurn 15: move L to (1,5) -- turn 15 action\n\nAfter turn 15, snake at (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTurn 16: move D to (1,4) eat food, snake: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  -- head (1,4)\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3), no food, so snake: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) -- after move, positions: new head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), and tail moved to (3,6)? Before move: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6) -- move to (1,3): new head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)  -- (3,6) is tail, not moved? When not eating, tail moves.\n\nBefore move: segments: head (1,4), body1 (1,5), body2 (2,5), body3 (2,6), body4 (3,6), tail (4,6)? Positions: after eating at turn 16, snake: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) -- so head (1,4), tail (4,6)\n\nTurn 17 move to (1,3): new head (1,3), new body1 (1,4), new body2 (1,5), new body3 (2,5), new body4 (2,6), new tail (3,6) -- and (4,6) left, so tail at (3,6)\n\nSnake: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 18: from (1,3), I moved R to (2,3) in the first plan, but I can move to other places? From (1,3), possible moves:\n\nU to (1,4) occupied, D to (1,2) obstacle, L wall, R to (2,3) free, so only R, no choice.\n\nSo at turn 18, must move R to (2,3).\n\nThen at (2,3), as before, I can choose D or R.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), it led to death.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2) at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: move D to (2,2)\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nNew body: (2,3) (old head), (1,3) (old body1), (1,4) (old body2), (1,5) (old body3), (2,5) (old body4, now tail) -- tail at (2,5)\n\nSnake: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nHead at (2,2), direction D.\n\nNow turn 19: from (2,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,3) occupied, D to (2,1) free, L to (1,2) obstacle, R to (3,2) free.\n\nSo move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nSay I move R to (3,2) to go right.\n\nMove R to (3,2)\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nNew body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) -- tail was (2,5), moved to (1,5)? After move: new head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nSnake: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nHead at (3,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 20: from (3,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,3) free\n\nD to (3,1) free? Not obstacle\n\nL to (2,2) occupied\n\nR to (4,2) free? Not obstacle\n\nSo possible U, D, R.\n\n(6,3) is at y=3, so I need to go up.\n\nMove U to (3,3) at turn 20.\n\nThen from (3,3), similar to before.\n\nTurn 20: move U to (3,3)\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew body: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) -- tail at (1,5), moved to (1,4)? After move: new head (3,3), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4)\n\nSnake: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nHead at (3,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 21: from (3,3), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,4) free\n\nD to (3,2) occupied\n\nL to (2,3) free? Not occupied now? Current snake: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) so (2,3) is occupied, so moving L to (2,3) collision\n\nR to (4,3) free\n\nSo U or R.\n\nTo reach (6,3), move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: move R to (4,3)\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew body: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3) -- tail at (1,4), moved to (1,3)? After move: new head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), tail (1,3)\n\nSnake: (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nHead at (4,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 22: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) as before.\n\nThen turn 23 to (6,3) but (6,3) food, eat.\n\nBut then from (6,3), same problem, only D to (6,2), then stuck.\n\nBecause from (6,2), U to (6,3) occupied, D to (6,1) obstacle, L to (5,2) obstacle, R wall.\n\nSo still stuck.\n\nThe issue is that after eating at (6,3), I am at the right edge with no escape because of obstacles at (6,1), (6,4), and walls.\n\nSo perhaps I should not eat (6,3) at all, or find a way to approach from a different direction.\n\nBut from the left, it's hard.\n\nAt turn 18, from (2,3), if I move U, but U to (2,4) is obstacle, not possible.\n\nOnly D or R.\n\nD to (2,2) then I can go to (3,2), but same thing.\n\nPerhaps I can go up from other cells.\n\nAnother idea: after eating the first food, at turn 17, I am at (1,3), move to (2,3) at turn 18, then from (2,3), move D to (2,2), then from (2,2), instead of moving R, move D to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move R to (3,1), but (3,1) free? Obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), not (3,1), so free.\n\nThen from (3,1), etc., but (6,3) is up, so I need to go up later.\n\nBut let's see the life span; at turn 18, food at (6,3) life span was 8 at turn 15, so at turn 18, it has life span 5 (after decreases: turn 15:8, turn16:7, turn17:6, turn18:5, turn19:4, etc.)\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut after going down, it might take more turns to reach.\n\nBut the problem is that eating (6,3) traps me.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it but have a way out.\n\nFor example, if I approach from above or below with space.\n\nBut from below, (6,2) is free, but after eating, I am at (6,3), and I have to move to (6,2), then stuck.\n\nIf I approach from above, but (6,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go to (6,4).\n\nThe only access to (6,3) is from left or below, since above is obstacle, right is wall.\n\nFrom left (5,3) or from below (6,2) or above but above blocked.\n\nSo no way to have an exit.\n\nTherefore, eating (6,3) is risky and likely fatal.\n\nI should avoid it and focus on survival.\n\nBut there might be no other food, so I need to just move safely.\n\nSince both foods are positive, but (6,3) is dangerous to eat.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it later or find a path that leaves space.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be tight.\n\nAnother thought: at the beginning, at turn 16, when at (1,5), I had to move D to (1,4) to eat, no choice.\n\nThen at turn 17, from (1,4) to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18 from (1,3) to (2,3)\n\nThen at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2)\n\nThen from (2,2), move R to (3,2)\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3) or D to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut to avoid (6,3), I can go to other areas.\n\nFor example, move to the center or something.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nList free cells.\n\nPlayable grid: x1-6, y1-6\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,3), (1,4) but food, (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6)\n\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) but (4,6) may be occupied, but free cell.\n\n(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\n(6,2), (6,3) food, (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut (5,6) obstacle, so (6,6) free.\n\nFrom current position, after turn 18 at (2,2), for example.\n\nBut I need to survive long-term.\n\nPerhaps I can go to the top-left area.\n\nBut let's accept that eating (6,3) is bad, so I should not go towards it.\n\nAt turn 18 from (2,3), instead of moving R or D, I have to choose one.\n\nMove D to (2,2) then to (3,2), then from (3,2) move U to (3,3), then from (3,3) move U to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) free, then I can go to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut no food, so I can wander.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so if possible eat food, but only (6,3) left, which is dangerous.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it but at a time when the tail is not blocking.\n\nBut in the death scenario, the problem is the location, not the tail.\n\nSo I think it's better to avoid (6,3) and just move safely for now.\n\nSince the instruction is to prioritize long-term survival, I should avoid the risk.\n\nSo for the sequence, I can plan the first few moves to eat the first food and then move to open area.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 15: L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 16: D to (1,4) eat food\n\nTurn 17: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: R to (2,3)\n\nNow at turn 18, from (2,3), move D to (2,2) to go down.\n\nTurn 18: move D to (2,2)\n\nPositions: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) -- head (2,2), tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 19: from (2,2), move R to (3,2)  -- can move to (3,2)\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nNew body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) -- tail at (2,5), moved to (1,5)? After move: new head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nSnake: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nHead at (3,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 20: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)  -- to go up\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew body: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) -- tail at (1,5), moved to (1,4)\n\nSnake: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nHead at (3,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 21: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)  -- free\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nNew body: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3) -- tail at (1,4), moved to (1,3)\n\nSnake: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nHead at (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 22: from (3,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, collision\n\nD to (3,3) occupied\n\nL to (2,4) obstacle\n\nR to (4,4) free\n\nSo only R to (4,4)\n\nMove R to (4,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can continue to open areas.\n\nBut I didn't eat the second food, but survived.\n\nSince both foods are +1, eating one is better than dying.\n\nIn the first approach, if I eat both, I die at turn 22, so score is 2 (ate two foods), but died.\n\nIf I eat only one, I survive longer, might eat more if food spawns, but in this state, no new food mentioned, so only existing.\n\nBut the state has only these two foods, so after they are gone or eaten, no more food, so I just need to survive as long as possible, but the score is based on food eaten, I think.\n\nThe objective is to maximize score by eating positive food, so each +1 food gives score.\n\nBut if I die early, I have less chance to eat.\n\nIn this case, with the given foods, if I eat (1,4) and avoid (6,3), I have score 1, and can survive longer.\n\nIf I eat both, score 2 but die immediately after.\n\nSo score 2 vs score 1 with potential for more, but no more food, so score 1 with longer survival, but survival doesn't give score, only food does.\n\nThe score is only from food, so if no more food, score is fixed once all food are eaten or disappeared.\n\nHere, if I don't eat (6,3), it disappears after turn 22, so no score.\n\nSo maximum possible score is 2, by eating both.\n\nBut if I eat both and die, score 2.\n\nIf I eat only one, score 1.\n\nSo better to eat both, even if I die after, because score is 2.\n\nBut the instruction says \"prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards\", but if no more rewards, then eating immediately is fine if I can.\n\nBut in this case, by eating (6,3), I die, so I get the score but game over.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I survive but score less.\n\nBut since the grid is small and with obstacles, I might not survive long anyway.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,3) and then not die if I have a way.\n\nBut earlier, from (6,2), no moves.\n\nUnless I can approach from a different angle.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,3) first, then to (6,3), but same.\n\nOr if I go to (6,3) from below, but when I move up to (6,3), then I have to move down to (6,2), stuck.\n\nIf I could move left after eating, but from (6,3), L is to (5,3), occupied at that time.\n\nIn the first sequence, when I am at (5,3), and move to (6,3), the body is behind me, so (5,3) is occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (6,3) without dying immediately after, given the snake position and obstacles.\n\nSo the safer choice is to eat only the first food and avoid the second.\n\nThen I can have a sequence for 5+ turns.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nStart from turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: move L to (1,5)  -- only choice\n\nTurn 16: move D to (1,4) eat food  -- only choice to avoid death\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3)  -- only choice\n\nTurn 18: move R to (2,3)  -- only choice\n\nNow at turn 18, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) to go to safer area.\n\nThen continue.\n\nTurn 18: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 19: from (2,2), move R to (3,2)  -- I can choose D or R, R is better to avoid corner.\n\nMove R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 20: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)  -- to go up\n\nTurn 21: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)  -- if possible, but at turn 21 from (3,3), after moving from (3,2) at turn 20.\n\nLet's list positions.\n\nAfter turn 18: moved D to (2,2), snake: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nHead (2,2)\n\nTurn 19: move R to (3,2), new head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)  -- after move: new head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nSnake: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nTurn 20: move U to (3,3), new head (3,3), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4)  -- tail moved to (1,4)\n\nSnake: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nTurn 21: from (3,3), move U to (3,4), new head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), tail (1,3)  -- tail moved to (1,3)\n\nSnake: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nTurn 22: from (3,4), as before, only R to (4,4)\n\nMove R to (4,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can provide this sequence for 5 turns from turn 15.\n\nBut turn 15 to turn 19 or more.\n\nFor the boxed answer, I need to list actions for turn 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, etc.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nFrom turn 15 to 19 or 20.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R (to (2,3)) or in this safe sequence, at turn 18 I moved D to (2,2), but from (2,3), moving D is a choice.\n\nIn the safe sequence, I moved D at turn 18.\n\nLet's write:\n\nTurn 15: L  (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 16: D  (to (1,4), eat food)\n\nTurn 17: D  (to (1,3))\n\nTurn 18: R  (to (2,3))  -- in both plans, this is fixed\n\nAt turn 18, from (2,3), I can choose to move D to (2,2) for safety.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 18: D  (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 19: R  (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 20: U  (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 21: U  (to (3,4))  -- if possible, and at turn 21 from (3,3), U to (3,4) is free.\n\nThen turn 22: R to (4,4)\n\netc.\n\nFor the answer, I can list up to turn 20 or so.\n\nSince the food at (6,3) is not eaten, it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R  -- to (2,3)\n\nBut at turn 18, after moving to (2,3), for turn 19, I need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have turn 18 move D or R, but in the fixed part, turn 18 is R to (2,3), then for turn 19, I move D to (2,2) in safe plan.\n\nLet's list the actions with turns.\n\n**Answer Format**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: action\nTurn 16: action\n...\n}\n\nFor at least 5 turns.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: L  (only choice)\n\nTurn 16: D  (only choice to survive)\n\nTurn 17: D  (only choice)\n\nTurn 18: R  (only choice to (2,3))\n\nNow for turn 19: from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nFor safety, move D to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 19: D\n\nThen turn 20: from (2,2), move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nThen turn 21: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSince I need to output, I can do up to turn 20.\n\nBut turn 21 is also possible.\n\nTo be concise, list 6 actions.\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D  ( to (2,2) )\n\nTurn 20: R  ( to (3,2) )\n\nThen for turn 21, it can be U, but not necessary.\n\nIn the boxed, I can list from 15 to 20.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, head direction is updated, but for movement, we just choose action.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 18 move R to (2,3), head direction R.\n\nThen at turn 19, moving D to (2,2) is not reverse, since current direction R, D is perpendicular, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think this is a safe sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan a sequence of moves that avoids collisions and strategically approaches food when safe. The current state at turn 15 requires an immediate move left (L) to (1,5) as it is the only viable option to avoid death. Subsequently, the only safe move at turn 16 is down (D) to (1,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score), as moving up would lead to a dead end. After eating, the snake grows to 6 segments, and the only move at turn 17 is down (D) to (1,3) to avoid collisions. At turn 18, the only move is right (R) to (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), the AI has a choice: moving right (R) to (3,3) would eventually lead to the food at (6,3), but this results in a guaranteed collision after eating due to the snake being trapped with no escape (as moving from (6,3) to (6,2) leaves no valid moves). Therefore, to prioritize survival, the AI moves down (D) to (2,2) at turn 19, avoiding the risky food.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 16. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall and can't be moved to. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. So these are also blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (6,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (2,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned, so I don't have to worry about penalties for now.\n\nLife span: for (1,4), life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 16, it will disappear after turn 19 (since 16,17,18,19: 4 turns). Similarly, (6,3) life span 7: disappears after turn 22 (16 to 22 is 7 turns? Let's calculate: from turn 16 to turn 22 is 7 turns? Turn 16: countdown 7, turn 17:6, ..., turn 22:1, turn 23:0 and disappears? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 16, life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at turn 17, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nFor (1,4): life span 4 at turn 16. So:\n\n- Turn 16: life span 4\n\n- Turn 17: life span 3\n\n- Turn 18: life span 2\n\n- Turn 19: life span 1\n\n- Turn 20: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3): life span 7 at turn 16, disappears after turn 22 (turn 22: life span 1, turn 23:0 gone).\n\n(2,1): life span 10, disappears after turn 25.\n\nNow, snake head is at (1,5), direction L (left). So from (1,5), moving left would go to (0,5), but x=0 is a wall, so I can't move left. Head direction is L, but I can change direction this turn.\n\nThe head direction is given as the current moving direction, but for the next move, I can choose to go in a different direction, except no instant reverse. Since last move was L (left), I cannot move right immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n\nPossible moves from (1,5):\n\n- Left: to (0,5) but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: to (2,5) but (2,5) is the second segment of the snake. Is that a collision? Snake positions: head (1,5), then (2,5) is the body. If I move right to (2,5), that's the body segment. But according to rules, body collision is deadly, but there's an exception: moving into the tail segment is ok if the tail moves away.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n**Deadly Collisions**: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nSo, in general, moving to a body segment is deadly, except for the tail segment, because when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if head moves to the current tail position, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nSo segments: head (1,5), body1 (2,5), body2 (2,6), body3 (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nIf I move right to (2,5), that's body1, not the tail, so it would be a collision, since (2,5) is occupied and not moving away immediately? When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the current body segments will be occupied.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides because that segment will still be there after the move. But for the tail, if head moves to the tail cell, then after the move, the tail moves to the previous position, so the head is now where tail was, and tail is gone, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,6). So moving to (2,5) would be moving to a body segment that is not the tail, so it should be a collision.\n\nSimilarly, up: to (1,6). Is (1,6) occupied? Snake positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So (1,6) is not in the list, so it might be free? But I need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7. (1,6): x=1, y=6, which is within 1 to 6, so not border wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n\n(1,2) is an obstacle, but (1,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nDown: to (1,4). (1,4) is a food position, with value 1.\n\nLeft: to (0,5), x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight: to (2,5), which is occupied by body, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from head (1,5):\n\n- Up: to (1,6)\n\n- Down: to (1,4)\n\n- Left: invalid\n\n- Right: invalid (to (2,5), body collision)\n\nHead direction is L, but since left is invalid, I don't have to worry about instant reverse for left, but for right, it would be instant reverse if I moved right, but right is invalid anyway.\n\nInstant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. But since R is invalid, it's not an option.\n\nSo only possible moves: Up or Down.\n\nNow, to (1,6) or to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) has food, positive food. If I move down to (1,4), I eat the food, so snake grows, new tail added, so length becomes 6.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible cells.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo free cells: all except walls, obstacles, and snake.\n\nSnake occupies: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nFood at: (1,4), (6,3), (2,1)\n\n(2,1) is food, and (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,1) might be accessible.\n\nNow, back to current move: I can go up to (1,6) or down to (1,4).\n\nIf I go down to (1,4), I eat the food. Then new snake positions: head moves to (1,4), and since I ate food, a new segment is added where the tail was, so tail was (4,6), but when snake moves, all segments shift, head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the one before.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, head to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail leaves its cell.\n\nIf eat food, head to food cell, new segment added at the position where tail was, so tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case:\n\nCurrent snake: positions: index 0: head (1,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: tail (4,6)\n\nIf I move down to (1,4) and eat food.\n\nNew head at (1,4), then segment 1 moves to where head was, (1,5), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (2,5), segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, (2,6), segment 4 (tail) moves to where segment 3 was, (3,6), and since I ate food, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, (4,6), so new tail is at (4,6).\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — so length 6.\n\nIf I don't eat, move to (1,6): head to (1,6), segment 1 to (1,5), segment 2 to (2,5), segment 3 to (2,6), segment 4 to (3,6), tail moves away from (4,6), so (4,6) is free now.\n\nNew positions: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail was at (4,6), now moved to (3,6), so (4,6) empty.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, for (1,4), it's not the tail, so no issue.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two options.\n\nOption A: Move down to (1,4), eat food, grow to length 6.\n\nThen snake at: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nHead at (1,4), direction was L, but now moving down, so direction D.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: up to (1,5), but (1,5) is now the second segment, body, so collision if move there.\n\nLeft: (0,4) wall, invalid.\n\nRight: (2,4), but (2,4) is an internal obstacle! Obstacles include (2,4), which is blocked.\n\nDown: to (1,3). (1,3) should be free? Walls: y=0 at bottom, so y decreases down? Typically in grids, y increases up, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's see.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) — so increasing y is up.\n\nD (x,y-1) — decreasing y is down.\n\nL (x-1,y)\n\nR (x+1,y)\n\nWalls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo from (1,4), down to (1,3): y=3, x=1.\n\nIs (1,3) free? Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (1,3) is not occupied by snake or anything.\n\nSo from (1,4), after eating, moves:\n\n- Up: to (1,5) but occupied by body, invalid.\n\n- Down: to (1,3)\n\n- Left: to (0,4) wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nThen snake moves to (1,3), head, then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), since (4,6) was tail but not added because no food, in this move, I didn't eat, so tail moves.\n\nAfter moving down to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), and (4,6) free.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move: up to (1,4), but (1,4) is now body segment, collision.\n\nDown to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,2), so invalid.\n\nLeft to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,3). (2,3) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nObstacles include (2,4) but not (2,3), so (2,3) free.\n\nSo only right to (2,3).\n\nThen to (2,3), and so on.\n\nBut this seems risky because I'm trapped in a corner.\n\nIf I go down to (1,4) now, I eat, but then I'm forced to go to (1,3), then to (2,3), and from there I might have options.\n\nBut let's see the other choice: if I go up to (1,6) now.\n\nMove up to (1,6).\n\nThen no eat, so snake moves: head to (1,6), segment1 to (1,5), segment2 to (2,5), segment3 to (2,6), segment4 to (3,6), tail leaves (4,6) free.\n\nNew positions: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nHead at (1,6), direction from (1,5) to (1,6) is up, so direction U.\n\nNow possible moves from (1,6):\n\nUp: to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nDown: to (1,5) but (1,5) is body segment, collision.\n\nLeft: to (0,6) wall, invalid.\n\nRight: to (2,6) but (2,6) is body segment? Positions: (1,6) head, (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\n(2,6) is the fourth segment? Indices: head (1,6), then (1,5) is next, then (2,5), then (2,6), then (3,6) tail.\n\n(2,6) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (3,6).\n\nSo moving to (2,6) would be to a body segment, collision.\n\nBut (2,6) is occupied, so I cannot move right to (2,6).\n\nIs there any other move? Up, down, left all invalid, right invalid. So I would die immediately if I move up to (1,6).\n\nThat can't be right. Let me double-check.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nMove up to (1,6): (1,6) is not occupied, so head moves to (1,6).\n\nThen segment1 (was head) moves to (1,5) — no, the segments shift.\n\nAfter move: new head at (1,6), the segment that was at (1,5) becomes the neck or body at (1,5), then (2,5) stays, but no.\n\nMovement: the head moves to new position, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ]\n\nMove head to (1,6)\n\nThen the first body segment moves to where head was, (1,5)\n\nThe second body segment moves to where the first body was, (2,5)\n\nThe third body segment moves to where the second body was, (2,6)\n\nThe tail moves to where the third body was, (3,6)\n\nAnd the previous tail (4,6) is now free.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), then (2,5), then (2,6), then (3,6) — tail at (3,6)\n\nNow, from (1,6), possible moves:\n\nUp: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nDown: to (1,5) — but (1,5) is occupied by the second segment, so body collision.\n\nLeft: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight: to (2,6) — (2,6) is occupied by the fourth segment, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n\nIndeed, no valid moves! The snake is trapped and will die on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving up to (1,6) is suicide; I must not do that.\n\nSo the only viable move now is down to (1,4), eat the food.\n\nThen, as before, I go to (1,4), grow, positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nThen from (1,4), only move down to (1,3), since other directions invalid.\n\nMove to (1,3): head to (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), (4,6) free.\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp to (1,4) — but (1,4) is body, collision.\n\nDown to (1,2) — but (1,2) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nLeft to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,3) — (2,3) should be free.\n\nSo move to (2,3).\n\nNow positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail at (2,6)? After moving to (2,3): head to (2,3), segment that was at (1,3) moves to (1,3)? Let's track.\n\nPrevious positions before move: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) but (4,6) is not part of snake anymore? After eating at (1,4), positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nThen move down to (1,3): head to (1,3), then the segment that was at (1,4) moves to (1,4)? No.\n\nThe first body segment moves to where head was, (1,4)\n\nThe second body segment moves to where the first body was, (1,5)\n\nThe third body segment moves to where the second body was, (2,5)\n\nThe fourth body segment moves to where the third body was, (2,6)\n\nThe tail moves to where the fourth body was, (3,6)\n\nAnd since no food eaten, no growth, so (4,6) is free.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6)\n\n(4,6) free.\n\nNow head at (1,3), move right to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) free.\n\nNew head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail moves to where the previous segment was, so (3,6) moves to (2,6)? Positions after move: head to (2,3), first body to (1,3), second body to (1,4), third body to (1,5), fourth body to (2,5), tail to (2,6)\n\nAnd (3,6) free.\n\nSo positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail at (2,6)\n\nNow head at (2,3), direction from (1,3) to (2,3) is right, so R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so invalid.\n\nDown: to (2,2) — should be free? Not wall, not obstacle listed. Obstacles: (2,4) but not (2,2), so free.\n\nLeft: to (1,3) — but (1,3) is body segment, collision.\n\nRight: to (3,3) — should be free.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nI need to think about the food and long-term survival.\n\nOther food: (6,3) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is food at (2,1), which is down from (2,3)? From (2,3), down to (2,2), then down to (2,1), but (2,1) has food, and life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (2,1) might be accessible.\n\nFirst, let's plan the path.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is another food.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nCurrently, after moving to (2,3), I have options.\n\nBut let's go back to the current turn.\n\nAt turn 16, I must move down to (1,4) to avoid death, since up is suicide.\n\nThen I move to (1,3), then to (2,3).\n\nNow at (2,3), I can go down or right.\n\nIf I go down to (2,2), then to (2,1) or other.\n\n(2,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, from (2,3) to (2,2): move down.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5), and (2,6) free? After moving down to (2,2): head (2,2), first body to (2,3), second body to (1,3), third body to (1,4), fourth body to (1,5), tail to (2,5)\n\nPositions: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5)\n\nNow head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp: to (2,3) — but (2,3) is body segment, collision.\n\nDown: to (2,1) — (2,1) is food, and free? Not occupied, so I can move there and eat.\n\nLeft: to (1,2) — but (1,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nRight: to (3,2) — should be free.\n\nSo possible: down to (2,1) eat, or right to (3,2).\n\nIf I eat at (2,1), then grow.\n\nNew head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — and new tail at (2,5)? Let's see.\n\nAfter eating: head to (2,1), segments: first body to (2,2), second body to (2,3), third body to (1,3), fourth body to (1,4), fifth body to (1,5), and new segment added at previous tail position (2,5), so tail at (2,5).\n\nPositions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nNow head at (2,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp: to (2,2) — body segment, collision.\n\nDown: to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft: to (1,1) — should be free? x=1,y=1, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles include (1,2) but not (1,1), so free.\n\nRight: to (3,1) — free? Not obstacle.\n\nObstacles: (5,1) but not (3,1), so free.\n\nSo moves: left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nFrom there, I can explore the grid.\n\nIf from (2,2) I had gone right to (3,2) instead.\n\nBut back to the food.\n\nThe food at (1,4) has short life span, only 4 turns, so it will disappear soon if not eaten. Since I ate it at turn 16, it's gone.\n\nNow the other food at (6,3) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is close, but if I don't eat it now, I can later.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles for clarity:\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo the grid has blocked cells.\n\nNow, snake is currently at turn 16, I move down to (1,4).\n\nThen to (1,3), then to (2,3).\n\nAt (2,3), I need to choose: down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf I go down to (2,2), I can then go to (2,1) to eat food, or to (3,2), etc.\n\n(2,1) food has long life, so I don't have to eat it immediately.\n\nBut eating it gives score, and I need to maximize score, but also survive long-term.\n\nThere is also food at (6,3), which is far, but I need to plan a path.\n\nMoreover, after eating (2,1), I might be in a tight spot.\n\nLet's simulate from (2,3).\n\nOption: move down to (2,2)\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) to eat, or right to (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (2,1) and eat, then at (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left corner, might be dead end.\n\n(1,1): possible moves? From (1,1), up to (1,2) but obstacle, down to (1,0) wall, left to (0,1) wall, right to (2,1) but after moving, it might be body.\n\nBetter to avoid corners.\n\nIf from (2,1) I go right to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc., but there is obstacle at (5,1), so (5,1) blocked.\n\n(3,1) to (4,1), then to (5,1) obstacle, so cannot go to (5,1), so from (4,1) I can go up or down, etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I go right to (3,3).\n\nMove right to (3,3).\n\nNew positions: head to (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5), (2,6) free.\n\nHead at (3,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp: to (3,4) — should be free? Not obstacle, not wall.\n\nDown: to (3,2) — free? (3,2) not listed obstacle.\n\nLeft: to (2,3) — body segment, collision.\n\nRight: to (4,3) — free.\n\nObstacles: (3,5) is obstacle, but (3,4) and (3,2) should be free.\n\n(3,5) blocked, but (3,4) is different.\n\nSo moves: up to (3,4), down to (3,2), right to (4,3).\n\nNow, food at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is on the right.\n\nAlso, (2,1) is below, but I can go to it later.\n\n(6,3) life span 7, from turn 16, so available until turn 22.\n\n(2,1) until turn 25.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat both, but need to find a path.\n\nFirst, at turn 16, I move down to (1,4).\n\nTurn 16: action D\n\nThen turn 17: from (1,4) only down to (1,3), so D\n\nTurn 18: from (1,3) only right to (2,3), so R\n\nNow at turn 18, head at (2,3), as above.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, so from turn 18.\n\nAt turn 18, positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)? Earlier: after turn 18 move to (2,3), positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail at (2,6)\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 16: move D to (1,4), eat food, positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3), no eat, positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6)\n\nTurn 18: move R to (2,3), no eat, positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail at (2,6)\n\n(3,6) free.\n\nNow turn 18, head at (2,3), direction R (since moved right from (1,3) to (2,3)).\n\nPossible moves: up to (2,4) but obstacle, invalid; down to (2,2); left to (1,3) body, invalid; right to (3,3).\n\nSo down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nI need to decide which is better for long-term.\n\nIf I go down to (2,2), then I can eat (2,1) soon.\n\nBut let's see the path to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), and obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), (5,6), (5,2), etc.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I go right to (3,3), then I can go to (4,3), (5,3), but (5,3) is free? Then to (6,3), but (6,3) is food, but is there a way?\n\n(5,3) to (6,3) is possible, but (6,3) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut let's check if accessible.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3).\n\n(5,3) to (6,3) right.\n\nNow, are there obstacles? (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is not, so should be ok.\n\nAlso, walls: x=7 wall, so (6,3) is within bounds.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3) if I go down, I might get stuck in the bottom.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (2,1), which is close, but I can eat it on the way or later.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if I eat (2,1), and the tail is adjacent, but in this case, when I eat, the tail is not adjacent.\n\nAt turn 18, if I move down to (2,2).\n\nTurn 18: move D to (2,2)\n\nPositions: head to (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5)\n\n(2,6) free.\n\nHead at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 19: I can move down to (2,1) to eat, or right to (3,2).\n\nIf I eat (2,1), move down to (2,1), eat food.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — and new tail at (2,5)? After eating: head to (2,1), first body to (2,2), second body to (2,3), third body to (1,3), fourth body to (1,4), fifth body to (1,5), new segment at previous tail (2,5), so positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nHead at (2,1), moves: up to (2,2) body, collision; down to (2,0) wall; left to (1,1); right to (3,1).\n\nSo to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nIf to (1,1), then from (1,1): up to (1,2) obstacle, down wall, left wall, right to (2,1) body, so trapped, die.\n\nTherefore, I must go right to (3,1) from (2,1).\n\nThen to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) to (4,1), then to (5,1) obstacle, so cannot go east; must go up or down.\n\nFrom (3,1), up to (3,2), down to (3,0) wall, left to (2,1) body, right to (4,1).\n\nSo up to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n\nThen if to (4,1), then up to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut it might be messy.\n\nIf from (2,2) at turn 19, I don't eat (2,1), but go right to (3,2), then I can avoid the corner.\n\nBut (2,1) food might expire later, but I can come back.\n\nLife span 10, from turn 16, so at turn 18, life span 8, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) life span 7, turn 16 to 22.\n\nTurn 18, (6,3) life span 5? Turn 16:7, turn17:6, turn18:5, turn19:4, etc.\n\nBut let's focus on the choice at turn 18.\n\nTo maximize long-term, I should head towards the other food (6,3) to eat it before it expires.\n\n(2,1) has longer life, so I can eat it later.\n\nAlso, the snake is in the left part, (6,3) is right, so moving right might be better.\n\nMoreover, if I go down to (2,2), I might be forced to eat (2,1) or go to corner.\n\nIf I go right to (3,3) at turn 18, then I can go to (4,3), etc.\n\nLet's plan a path to (6,3).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3).\n\n(5,3) to (6,3) is possible.\n\nAre there obstacles? (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) should be free.\n\n(5,2) blocked, but (5,3) not.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) blocked, but (6,3) not.\n\nSo path exists.\n\nNow, from (2,3) at turn 18, move right to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 19: from (3,3), I can go up to (3,4), down to (3,2), or right to (4,3).\n\nTo reach (6,3), going right directly might be efficient.\n\nBut I need to avoid obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3).\n\n(5,3) is free? Yes.\n\nBut when I move to (6,3), I eat the food.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to have space to move.\n\nAlso, the tail is following.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, at turn 18: move R to (3,3)\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5)? After move: head to (3,3), first body to (2,3), second body to (1,3), third body to (1,4), fourth body to (1,5), tail to (2,5)\n\nPositions: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5)\n\n(2,6) free, but not part.\n\nNow turn 19: from (3,3), moves: up (3,4), down (3,2), right (4,3)\n\nI choose to go right to (4,3) to head towards (6,3).\n\nMove R to (4,3)\n\nPositions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — tail at (1,5)? After move: head to (4,3), first body to (3,3), second body to (2,3), third body to (1,3), fourth body to (1,4), tail to (1,5)\n\nPositions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — tail at (1,5)\n\nTurn 20: from (4,3), moves: up (4,4), down (4,2), left (3,3) body, invalid, right (5,3)\n\nSo up, down, or right.\n\nGo right to (5,3).\n\nMove R to (5,3)\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail at (1,4)\n\nTurn 21: from (5,3), moves: up (5,4), down (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle! (5,2) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\nLeft (4,3) body, invalid.\n\nRight (6,3) — which is food.\n\nSo only up to (5,4) or down invalid, left invalid, right to (6,3).\n\nDown to (5,2) invalid, so only up to (5,4) or right to (6,3).\n\nIf I go right to (6,3), I eat the food.\n\nMove to (6,3), eat.\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) — and new segment at previous tail (1,4), so positions: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail at (1,4)\n\nNow head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: up to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nDown to (6,2) — should be free? (6,2) not obstacle.\n\nLeft to (5,3) body, collision.\n\nRight to (7,3) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only down to (6,2).\n\nThen move to (6,2).\n\nPositions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) — tail at (1,3), (1,4) free? After move: head to (6,2), first body to (6,3), second body to (5,3), etc., tail to (1,3)\n\nPositions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) — tail at (1,3)\n\nHead at (6,2), direction D (since from (6,3) to (6,2) down).\n\nMoves: up to (6,3) body, collision; down to (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, invalid; left to (5,2) obstacle, invalid; right to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nAll moves invalid! Trapped and die.\n\nProblem at (6,2): surrounded by obstacles or body.\n\nSpecifically: up (6,3) body, down (6,1) obstacle, left (5,2) obstacle, right wall.\n\nSo death.\n\nTherefore, going directly to (6,3) leads to a dead end.\n\nI need a different approach.\n\nAt turn 21, from (5,3), instead of going right to (6,3), I could go up to (5,4).\n\nThen from there, I might have options.\n\nLet's backtrack.\n\nAt turn 20, head at (4,3), I could go up or down instead of right.\n\nBut I need to eat (6,3) before it expires.\n\nTurn 21 is turn 16+5=21, (6,3) life span: at turn 16:7, turn17:6, turn18:5, turn19:4, turn20:3, turn21:2, turn22:1, disappears turn23.\n\nSo at turn 21, life span 2, still there.\n\nAt turn 20, from (4,3), I can go up to (4,4) or down to (4,2) or right to (5,3).\n\nIf I go up to (4,4), for example.\n\nBut let's think of a safe path to (6,3) with an exit.\n\nFor instance, I could approach from above or below.\n\n(6,3) has obstacle at (6,4) above and (6,1) below, so only left is open, but (5,3) might be occupied.\n\nSince the area around (6,3) is tight, I need to eat it when I have a way out.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (2,1) first and then go to (6,3), but (2,1) is on the left, (6,3) right, so I might not have time.\n\nLife span: (2,1) life span 10, turn16 to25, (6,3) turn16 to22.\n\nTurn 22 is last chance for (6,3).\n\nAt turn 18, I can still reach it.\n\nFrom (2,3) at turn 18, instead of going right, I could go down to (2,2), then not eat (2,1), but go right to (3,2), then to (4,2), but (4,2) free? Then to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\n(5,2) obstacle, so cannot go to (5,2).\n\nFrom (3,2) I can go to (4,2), then from (4,2) to (4,3) or (4,1), etc.\n\nBut let's list a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should include the move to (1,4) as necessary, but for the long-term, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, when I move down to (1,4), I eat, then to (1,3), then to (2,3), then from (2,3) I can go down to (2,2), then to (2,1) but as before, after eating (2,1), I can go to (3,1), then to (4,1), then to (4,2) since (5,1) obstacle, so from (4,1) go up to (4,2), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut it might work.\n\nLet's define the actions for the next few turns.\n\nTurn 16: must move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: move R to (2,3)\n\nAt turn 18, positions as before.\n\nNow for turn 19, from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), then at turn 19, positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5)\n\nThen turn 20: from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) to eat or right to (3,2).\n\nIf I move right to (3,2), then positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — tail at (1,5)\n\nHead at (3,2), direction R.\n\nMoves: up to (3,3), down to (3,1), left to (2,2) body, invalid, right to (4,2)\n\nSo up, down, or right.\n\n(3,3) is free, (3,1) free, (4,2) free.\n\nI can go up to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc. to reach (6,3).\n\nOr down to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut to eat (6,3), going via (3,3) is better.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (3,3), then as before.\n\nBut earlier when I went to (5,3), I had a problem.\n\nAt (5,3), I could go up to (5,4) instead of right to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) should be free? Obstacles: (5,6), (5,2), but not (5,4), so free.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to (5,5), then to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, invalid.\n\n(5,5) to (6,5) or other.\n\nLet's find a path to eat (6,3) safely.\n\nFor example, from the south.\n\n(6,3) can be accessed from (6,2) or (5,3), but (6,2) is below.\n\n(6,2) is free, as per earlier.\n\nIf I go to (6,2) first, then to (6,3) to eat.\n\nBut when I eat at (6,3), I need to have a move after.\n\nFrom (6,3), after eating, I can only go down to (6,2), but then from (6,2), as before, trapped.\n\nUnless the tail is not blocking.\n\nBut in the earlier sequence, when I moved to (6,2), the body was behind.\n\nBut after eating at (6,3), if I go down to (6,2), then from (6,2), I have no moves.\n\nSo to avoid that, I should not go to (6,3) directly when the only exit is down, but down is (6,2), which is a dead end if no further moves.\n\n(6,2) has moves: up to (6,3), down to (6,1) obstacle, left to (5,2) obstacle, right wall.\n\nSo only up, but if (6,3) is body, it's blocked.\n\nSo indeed, (6,2) is a dead end unless the snake is short or something.\n\nTherefore, eating (6,3) is risky because of the location.\n\nPerhaps I should skip (6,3) and go for (2,1) instead.\n\n(2,1) is safer to eat.\n\nThen I can explore the bottom or left.\n\nBut there is also the food at (1,4) which I already ate.\n\nNow, at turn 18, from (2,3), move down to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,2), I can move right to (3,2) instead of down.\n\nMove R to (3,2)\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — tail at (1,5)\n\nHead at (3,2), direction R.\n\nMoves: up to (3,3), down to (3,1), left to (2,2) body, invalid, right to (4,2)\n\nSo up, down, or right.\n\nI can go up to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nOr down to (3,1), then to (4,1), then to (4,2), etc.\n\nOr right to (4,2).\n\nTo reach (6,3), from (3,2) go up to (3,3), then right to (4,3), then to (5,3), then at (5,3), I can go up to (5,4) first, then from (5,4) to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,5), then to (6,5) or (4,5), etc.\n\n(6,5) is free? Walls x=7, y=7, so (6,5) within bounds.\n\nObstacles: (5,6), (3,5), but not (6,5).\n\n(5,6) obstacle, but (6,5) not.\n\nSo from (5,4) to (5,5), then to (6,5), then to (6,4) obstacle, no, to (6,5) then down to (6,4) obstacle, or left to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (6,3) is at y=3, so I need to go down.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,5), then from (6,5) down to (6,4) obstacle, invalid, so cannot.\n\nFrom (5,5) I can go down to (5,4), but that's back.\n\nOr from (5,4) I can go down to (5,3), but (5,3) is the previous position.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps from (4,3) go down to (4,2), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut let's give up on (6,3) for now and focus on (2,1).\n\nAt turn 18, from (2,3), move down to (2,2)\n\nTurn 19: from (2,2), move down to (2,1) to eat.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5)\n\nThen turn 20: from (2,1), move right to (3,1) (since left to (1,1) is dead end)\n\nMove R to (3,1)\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — tail at (1,5)\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R.\n\nMoves: up to (3,2), down to (3,0) wall, invalid, left to (2,1) body, invalid, right to (4,1)\n\nSo only up to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n\nSay go right to (4,1).\n\nMove R to (4,1)\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail at (1,4)\n\nHead at (4,1), direction R.\n\nMoves: up to (4,2), down to (4,0) wall, invalid, left to (3,1) body, invalid, right to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only up to (4,2).\n\nMove U to (4,2)\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3) — tail at (1,3)\n\nHead at (4,2), direction U.\n\nThen I can continue, to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I have eaten two foods, and the snake is longer, but I can survive.\n\nThe food at (6,3) might expire, but I can't reach it safely, so it's better to avoid it and focus on survival.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize score, but survival is priority, so if I can't eat (6,3) without dying, I should not go for it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) I can eat safely.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output the actions for turn 16 and a few more.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence of at least 5 moves.\n\nCurrent turn t1=16, so turns 16 to 20 or 21.\n\nLet's decide on a sequence.\n\nTurn 16: move D to (1,4) - necessary\n\nTurn 17: move D to (1,3) - only choice\n\nTurn 18: move R to (2,3) - only choice from (1,3)\n\nAt turn 18, from (2,3), I can choose to move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), then turn 19: from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) to eat or right to (3,2).\n\nTo be safe, I can move right to (3,2) to avoid the corner.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut let's output the moves.\n\nSince the food at (2,1) has long life, I can eat it later.\n\nFor the sequence, let's go for (2,2) at turn 19.\n\nTurn 18: move D to (2,2)  -- from (2,3) down to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,2), move R to (3,2)  -- avoid eating (2,1) now\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go up to (3,3) or right to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 20 or 21.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list the actions.\n\nAlso, for the box.\n\nSo let's finalize.\n\nTurn 16: D (down to (1,4))\n\nTurn 17: D (down to (1,3))\n\nTurn 18: R (right to (2,3)) -- from (1,3) to (2,3) is right.\n\nAt (2,3), for turn 19, I move down to (2,2).\n\nTurn 19: D (down to (2,2))\n\nThen at (2,2), for turn 20, I can move right to (3,2) or down to (2,1).\n\nTo keep options open, move right to (3,2).\n\nTurn 20: R (right to (3,2))\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (3,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can stop at turn 20 or include turn 21.\n\nSince it says \"5+ turns ahead\", from turn 16, 5 turns ahead is up to turn 21.\n\nBut the actions are for the turns starting from t1.\n\nSo let's provide turns 16 to 20.\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D ( to (2,2) )\n\nTurn 20: R ( to (3,2) )\n\nBut at turn 20, from (2,2) to (3,2), it's right.\n\nIn the positions, it should be fine.\n\nTo be consistent.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 18, if I move right to (3,3), then turn 19 to (4,3), turn 20 to (5,3), then at (5,3), I can go up to (5,4) to avoid the dead end at (6,3).\n\nBut I don't have to eat (6,3).\n\nSo both are possible.\n\nBut since (2,1) is closer and safer, moving down at turn 19 might be better.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll go with the sequence that eats (2,1) later.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D ( to (2,2) )\n\nTurn 20: R ( to (3,2) )\n\nThen at turn 21, from (3,2), I can go to (3,3) or (4,2), but I don't need to specify beyond.\n\nThe answer should include the actions for the turns.\n\nIn the box, I can list from 16 to 20.\n\nBut let's make sure the actions are valid.\n\nTurn 16: D to (1,4) eat\n\nTurn 17: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: R to (3,2)\n\nAll valid moves.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can then decide to go to (3,3) or (4,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nBut for the purpose, this should be fine.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\), the snake must prioritize long-term survival while maximizing score. The only immediate move that avoids death is down (D) to (1,4) to eat the positive food and avoid the trap at (1,6). After eating, the snake is forced to move down to (1,3) on turn 17. On turn 18, the only valid move is right (R) to (2,3). From (2,3), moving down to (2,2) on turn 19 avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to potentially eat the food at (2,1) later, which has a long life span (until turn 25). On turn 20, moving right to (3,2) opens up the board for further exploration and avoids the corner near (2,1), allowing flexibility for future turns.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns and sets up opportunities to eat the remaining food at (6,3) or (2,1) while avoiding dead ends. The food at (6,3) is risky due to its location near obstacles, so it may be skipped if the path is unsafe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: D (down)  \nTurn 17: D (down)  \nTurn 18: R (right)  \nTurn 19: D (down)  \nTurn 20: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 17. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block some cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving down. Since it's moving down, the previous move was down, so I can't move up immediately because of no instant reverse.\n\nFood: two items:\n\n- (6,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, so eating either gives +1 score and increases length by 1. No negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so these lines are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5).\n\nSo let's list all wall cells:\n\n- All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n\n- All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n\n- All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n\n- All (x,7) for x=0 to 7? No, the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so corners are included, but for example (0,0) is a wall, etc.\n\nInternal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(5,2) is listed, and (5,1), (5,6) so multiple.\n\nSnake: positions: (1,4) head, then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail. So the snake is moving down from (1,5) to (1,4)? Head is at (1,4), and previous was (1,5), so since head direction is D (down), moving to lower y. In grid, y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in coordinates, y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n\nConfirm:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — up, increasing y\n\n- D: (x, y-1) — down, decreasing y\n\n- L: (x-1, y) — left, decreasing x\n\n- R: (x+1, y) — right, increasing x\n\nIn snake positions, head at (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), etc. (1,5) is above (1,4) since y=5 > y=4, so the snake was moving down from (1,5) to (1,4)? Positions are listed head first: [(1,4), (1,5), ...] so (1,4) is head, then (1,5) is the next segment, which is above it, so the snake is moving downwards, from (1,5) to (1,4), so direction D is correct.\n\nNow, head at (1,4), direction D, so last move was down to (1,4).\n\nPossible moves: since moving down, I can't move up (U) immediately because no instant reverse. So possible actions: D (continue down), L (left), or R (right). But need to check for collisions.\n\nCurrent position: (1,4)\n\nMove options:\n\n- U: (1,5) — but (1,5) is the snake body, and since it's adjacent to head, moving there would cause collision because the body segment is still there when head moves? Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment. But when moving, the tail moves after the head, so if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it might be ok, but only if it's the tail cell specifically.\n\nRule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nSo (1,5) is the neck, directly above head, so if I move up to (1,5), that is occupied by the body, not the tail, so it would be collision, because it's not the tail cell.\n\nTail is at (4,6).\n\nSo for move U: to (1,5), which is occupied by the second segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nList adjacent cells to head (1,4):\n\n- Up: (1,5) - occupied by snake body (segment 2), not tail, so deadly.\n\n- Down: (1,3) - y=3, which is within bounds? Walls: y=0 is bottom, so y=3 is valid if not wall.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,3) is not border, and internal obstacles: let's list all blocked cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(1,2) is an obstacle! So (1,2) is wall.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is obstacle? (2,4) is listed as internal obstacle.\n\nSnake head is at (1,4), so adjacent:\n\n- North: (1,5) - occupied by snake body, collision\n\n- South: (1,3) - but is (1,3) a wall or free? (1,3) not listed as obstacle, and not border, so should be free? But (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) is different.\n\n(1,3) is not in obstacle list, and not border, so free.\n\nBut let's confirm: obstacles are (1,2), which is below, so (1,3) should be empty.\n\n- East: (2,4) - (2,4) is listed as internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- West: (0,4) - x=0 is border wall, so cannot move west.\n\nx=0 is wall, so (0,4) invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (1,4):\n\n- Down: (1,3) - seems free, no wall, not occupied? Occupied by what? Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So (1,3) not in list, and not wall, so should be free.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) is above that.\n\n- Left: (0,4) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n\n- Up: (1,5) - snake body, collision, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,3)? But head direction is D, so down is possible.\n\nBut (1,3) is free, so moving down to (1,3) should be safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the tail: tail is at (4,6), so moving to (1,3) doesn't involve tail.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will be: head to (1,3), then body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and tail (4,6) will move to where? When head moves to new cell, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten. Since no food at (1,3), tail will move, so the new positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and (4,6) is removed? Tail movement: when snake moves without eating, the tail segment is removed, so the last position is vacated.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so snake length same. If food, tail not removed, so length increases.\n\nHere, moving to (1,3), no food there, so tail (4,6) is removed, new positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] and (4,6) free.\n\nBut (3,6) was second last, now last, so tail at (3,6).\n\nNow, but we have food to consider.\n\nFood at (6,3) and (2,1).\n\n(6,3): x=6,y=3, life span 6, value 1\n\n(2,1): x=2,y=1, life span 9, value 1\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn 17, life span decreases.\n\nCurrent turn is 17, so for (6,3), life span 6, after turn 17, it will be 5, then 4, etc., disappearing when life span 0.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 9, after turn 17, 8, etc.\n\nI need to plan multiple moves.\n\nBut first, from (1,4), only possible move is down to (1,3), since all other directions blocked or deadly.\n\nIs that right?\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- (1,5): north, occupied by snake body (segment at (1,5)), not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- (1,3): south, not occupied, not wall (walls: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) is not, so free)\n\n- (2,4): east, but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall\n\n- (0,4): west, border wall\n\nSo yes, only down to (1,3) is possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the obstacles: internal obstacles include (1,2) and (2,4), etc.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) is clear.\n\nAlso, food: (2,1) is at (2,1), which is below.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3), head at (1,3), direction down.\n\nNow, from (1,3), possible moves:\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- North: (1,4) - but (1,4) will be occupied by the body after move? After moving to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), etc. So (1,4) is the neck.\n\nIf I move north to (1,4), which is now occupied by the body segment (which was the previous head), so moving there would cause collision.\n\n- South: (1,2) - but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid\n\n- East: (2,3) - is this free? (2,3) not listed as obstacle, not border, not occupied by snake? Snake positions after move: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So (2,3) not occupied.\n\n- West: (0,3) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\nSo possible moves from (1,3): east to (2,3) or north to (1,4) but north to (1,4) is body, collision, so only east to (2,3) is possible? But (1,4) is body, not tail, so cannot move there.\n\nTail is at (3,6), far away.\n\nSo only possible move is east to (2,3).\n\nThen after that, head at (2,3), direction east.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), or (1,3) but (1,3) is now body.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, wall.\n\nAlso, food at (2,1) is below.\n\nI need to think longer term.\n\nFirst, on turn 17, from current position (1,4), only move is down to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 18, from (1,3), only move is east to (2,3).\n\nThen on turn 19, head at (2,3), direction east.\n\nNow from (2,3), adjacent cells:\n\n- North: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n\n- South: (2,2) - not obstacle? (2,2) not listed, so free\n\n- East: (3,3) - not obstacle, free\n\n- West: (1,3) - occupied by body (since after move to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), etc., so (1,3) is body, not tail, so collision if move west)\n\nAlso, walls: (2,2) and (3,3) should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), etc., no (2,2) or (3,3).\n\nSo from (2,3), can move south to (2,2) or east to (3,3).\n\nCannot move north or west.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) is south of (2,2), so if I go south to (2,2), then I can go to (2,1) next, but (2,1) is food.\n\nAlso, another food at (6,3), which is east.\n\nBut let's see life span.\n\nCurrent turn 17.\n\nAfter move to (1,3) on turn 17, then to (2,3) on turn 18, then on turn 19, at (2,3).\n\nFood (2,1): life span 9, on turn 17, decreases to 8, turn 18 to 7, turn 19 to 6, etc. So it has many turns left.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3): life span 6, turn 17 to 5, turn 18 to 4, turn 19 to 3, etc.\n\nNow, from (2,3), if I move south to (2,2), then head at (2,2) on turn 19.\n\nThen from (2,2), can move to (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\nBut (2,3) is body, (1,2) is obstacle wall, (3,2) might be free.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so invalid.\n\n(2,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\n(3,2) not obstacle.\n\nSo possible: south to (2,1) or east to (3,2)? (2,1) is south, (3,2) is east-southeast? From (2,2), east is (3,2), south is (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is the food position.\n\nIf I move south to (2,1) on turn 20, I eat the food, since it's positive, snake grows, so length increases by 1, tail doesn't move.\n\nThen positions: head to (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — let's list.\n\nAfter turn 19: at (2,2), positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail is (3,6) or (2,6)? After moving to (2,3) on turn 18: positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6)\n\nThen move to (2,2) on turn 19: no food at (2,2)? Food is at (2,1), not (2,2), so move to (2,2), tail moves, positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), and (3,6) removed? Tail was (3,6), so removed, new tail is (2,6)? Positions: after head to (2,2), the body segments: previous head (2,3) becomes neck, then (1,3), etc., down to (2,6), which was second last, now last.\n\nList: new positions: head (2,2), then the previous segments: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — and (3,6) is gone. So tail at (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 20, move to (2,1): food at (2,1), so eat it, head to (2,1), tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — and length increased to 7.\n\nBut is (2,1) safe? It's not wall, and not body, so yes.\n\nBut there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (2,1), the tail is at (2,6), far away, not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nAfter eating, tail is at (2,6), head at (2,1), so fine.\n\nNow, the other food at (6,3).\n\nBut after eating (2,1), I'm at (2,1), and need to navigate.\n\nBut let's see if I can get to (6,3) in time.\n\n(6,3) life span: on turn 17, life 6, so after turn 17, life 5; turn 18, life 4; turn 19, life 3; turn 20, life 2; turn 21, life 1; turn 22, life 0, disappears.\n\nSo it must be eaten by turn 21 or before, since on turn 22 it disappears.\n\nCurrent turn 17, after move to (1,3).\n\nTurn 18: to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: to (2,2) or to (3,3)? I was planning to go to (2,2) then to (2,1).\n\nBut from (2,3), I could go east to (3,3) instead.\n\n(3,3) is free, I think.\n\nFrom (2,3), move east to (3,3) on turn 19.\n\nThen head at (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), can go to (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (2,3) but (2,3) is body.\n\n(3,4) might be free, but (3,5) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,5) is listed, so (3,5) wall, but (3,4) not.\n\n(3,4) should be free.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\nAlso, (2,3) body.\n\nSo from (3,3), can move south to (3,2), north to (3,4), east to (4,3), or west to (2,3) but body, invalid.\n\nNow, to reach (6,3), which is east.\n\nFrom (3,3), move east to (4,3) on turn 20.\n\nThen to (5,3) or other, but (5,3) might be free? Obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), etc.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nThen to (6,3) on turn 21? But (6,3) has life span decreasing: on turn 21, life should be 1? Let's track life.\n\nTurn 17: food (6,3) life 6, after turn, life 5\n\nTurn 18: life 4\n\nTurn 19: life 3\n\nTurn 20: life 2\n\nTurn 21: life 1\n\nTurn 22: life 0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 21, if head at (6,3), life 1, can eat before it disappears.\n\nNow, from (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3).\n\n(5,3): is it free? No obstacles listed at (5,3), walls only borders and internals as given.\n\nInternals: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but not (5,3), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3): not wall, but (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) different.\n\nAlso, (6,1) obstacle, but (6,3) free.\n\nBut when moving to (6,3), need to check if possible.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3).\n\nBut from (3,3) to (4,3) on turn 20, then turn 21 to (5,3)? Turn 20 at (4,3), then turn 21 to (5,3), then turn 22 to (6,3), but on turn 22, food disappears, so too late.\n\nTurn 21: at (5,3), move to (6,3) on turn 21, which has life 1, so can eat.\n\nLife decreases every turn including current, so on turn when you move, if food is there and life >0, you eat it.\n\nAt start of turn, before move, life decreases? The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", so when life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (6,3): initial life 6 at turn 17.\n\nAfter turn 17, life decreases to 5.\n\nSimilarly, after each turn.\n\nWhen the snake moves to a cell with food, if food is present, it is eaten.\n\nSo on turn t, before move, life decreases by 1 for that turn.\n\nThen, if after decrease, life >0, food is still there, and if head moves to it, it is eaten.\n\nIf life becomes 0 after decrease, food disappears before move.\n\nRule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for example, at turn 17, food has life L.\n\nAfter turn 17 is processed, life decreases to L-1.\n\nIf after decrease, life >=1, food present.\n\nIf head moves to food cell during turn t, it is eaten.\n\nIf after decrease life=0, food disappears before any move.\n\nIn this case, (6,3) at turn 17, life 6.\n\nAfter turn 17, life decreases to 5.\n\nOn turn 18, after decrease, life 4, and so on.\n\nTo eat on turn t, before the life decrease for turn t, it must have life >=1.\n\nSince decrease happens at start of turn or end? The rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but it doesn't specify when.\n\nTo be safe, I think we assume that at the beginning of each turn, for each food, life decreases by 1. If life becomes 0, food disappears immediately. Then the snake moves.\n\nIf snake moves to a cell with food that is present, it eats it.\n\nFor (6,3):\n\n- Start turn 17: life 6\n\n- Decrease to 5, still present.\n\n- Snake moves, if to (6,3), eat, but current head not at (6,3).\n\nAfter turn 17: life 5\n\nTurn 18: decrease to 4\n\n...\n\nTurn 21: start turn, life decreases to 1 (since turn 17:5,18:4,19:3,20:2,21:1)\n\nThen food present, snake moves; if to (6,3), eat.\n\nTurn 22: start turn, life decreases to 0, food disappears, cannot eat.\n\nSo must be eaten by turn 21.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1): life 9 at turn 17, decreases to 8 after turn 17, etc., has many turns.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nIf I go directly to (6,3):\n\nFrom current turn 17: move to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: to (2,3)\n\nNow from (2,3), I can go east to (3,3) on turn 19? Turn 19 from (2,3) to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 20: from (3,3) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) to (5,3)? (5,3) is not (6,3), I need to go to (6,3) on turn 21.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (6,3) directly? No, adjacent only.\n\n(4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3), so on turn 21, from (5,3) to (6,3) only if I am at (5,3) on turn 20.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 17: to (1,3) - head at (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: to (2,3) - head (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: to (3,3) - head (3,3)\n\nTurn 20: to (4,3) - head (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: to (5,3) - head (5,3)\n\nBut to eat (6,3), I need to be at (6,3) on turn 21, so from (5,3) on turn 21 to (6,3) on turn 21? Turn 21: from (5,3) move to (6,3).\n\nBut on turn 21, at start, (6,3) life decreases to 1, present, so moving to it eats it.\n\nBut I am at (5,3) on turn 21 only if I moved there on turn 20.\n\nTurn 20: I am at (4,3), move to (5,3), so on turn 20 end, at (5,3).\n\nTurn 21: start, life for (6,3) decreases to 1, present. Then I move from (5,3) to (6,3), eat.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I reach earlier? From (3,3) on turn 19, I could go directly to (4,3) or other, but (3,3) to (4,3) on turn 20? Turn 19 at (3,3), turn 20 to (4,3), same as above.\n\nFrom (2,3) on turn 19, I could go to (3,3) or to (2,2).\n\nBut to reach (6,3) by turn 21, I need to be at (5,3) on turn 21 to move to (6,3).\n\nEarliest I can be at (5,3) is turn 21 if I move step by step east.\n\nFrom (2,3) on turn 19, to (3,3) turn 19? Turn 19: from (2,3) move to (3,3), arrive at end of turn.\n\nSimilarly, no faster.\n\n(2,3) to (3,3) is one step, etc.\n\nBut from (2,3) on turn 19, I can only go to (2,2) or (3,3), as earlier.\n\nIf I go to (3,3) on turn 19, then turn 20 to (4,3), turn 21 to (5,3), then turn 22 to (6,3) but on turn 22, food gone, cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 21, at (5,3), move to (6,3) to eat on turn 21.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but when I move to (6,3), is it safe? (6,3) has no obstacle, but (6,4) is obstacle above, but (6,3) should be free.\n\nAlso, snake body: when moving to (6,3), the body is behind, so no collision.\n\nBut let's see the path: from (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3).\n\n(5,3) is free, (6,3) free.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,2), but not affecting.\n\nNow, after eating at (6,3), snake grows, so length increases.\n\nBut I also have the other food at (2,1).\n\nIf I go for (6,3), I might miss (2,1) or vice versa.\n\nBut (2,1) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nNow, back to turn 17: only move is to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 18: to (2,3)\n\nNow at turn 18, from (2,3), I have a choice: go south to (2,2) towards (2,1), or east to (3,3) towards (6,3).\n\nBut to reach (6,3) by turn 21, I need to go east on turn 19 to (3,3).\n\nIf I go south to (2,2) on turn 19, then I can go to (2,1) on turn 20.\n\nBut then I might not reach (6,3) in time.\n\nFrom (2,1), to reach (6,3) by turn 21 is difficult, since (2,1) to (6,3) is 4 steps right and 2 up, but with obstacles, might take longer.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), to go east, but (3,1) might be free? Obstacles: (3,5) but not (3,1), so (3,1) free, but (2,1) to (3,1) east, then (4,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, so cannot go directly.\n\n(5,1) obstacle, so from (4,1) need to go up or down.\n\nBut y=1, below is y=0 wall, so must go up to (4,2), but (5,2) obstacle, so to (4,2), then (4,3), etc. Messy.\n\nWhereas from current path, going directly to (6,3) via east is better for that food.\n\nBut (2,1) has value and can be eaten later since life span long.\n\nLife span 9, after turn 17 decrease to 8, turn 18 to 7, etc., so after turn 17, life 8, meaning it lasts until turn 17+8=25? Life span decreases each turn, so initial life N, disappears after N turns from spawn or from current?\n\nThe life span is given at current turn, and decreases each turn, so it has L turns left including current turn? At turn t, life span L, so it will disappear after L more turns.\n\nFor (2,1), life span 9 at turn 17, so it will disappear after 9 turns, meaning on turn 26 it disappears (after decrease on turn 26).\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) life 6 at turn 17, disappears on turn 23 (after decrease).\n\nTurn: at turn 17, life L, after turn 17 decrease, L-1; if L-1>0, present until next decrease.\n\nDisappears when after decrease life=0.\n\nSo for (2,1): turn 17: life 9, after dec to 8\n\nTurn 18: dec to 7\n\n...\n\nTurn 25: dec to 1? Start turn 17:9, dec to 8\n\nTurn 18: dec to 7\n\n...\n\nTurn 25: start life 1, dec to 0, disappears.\n\nSo must eat by turn 24? On turn 24, after dec, if life >=1, but on turn 24 start, life is 9 - (24-17) = 9 -7 =2? Let's calculate remaining turns.\n\nAt turn t, food has life L.\n\nAfter k turns, at turn t+k, life is L - k.\n\nFood present when life >0 before decrease for that turn? Better: food is present at the start of turn if after previous decrease life >0.\n\nStandard: at beginning of turn, for each food, decrease life by 1. If after decrease life >0, food present; if life=0, food disappears.\n\nThen snake moves; if moves to cell with present food, eats it.\n\nFor (2,1) at turn 17: start, life 9, decrease to 8, >0, present.\n\nTurn 18: decrease to 7, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn 25: decrease to 0 (since 9 - (25-17) = 9-8=1, decrease to 0), disappears.\n\nSo last chance to eat is on turn 24: at start, life 1 (since turn 24: before decrease, life is 9 - (24-17) = 9-7=2? Turn index.\n\nTurn 17: after dec, life 8 (for the state after turn)\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think from the count.\n\nAt turn t, food has life L.\n\nIt can be eaten on turn t if L >=1 and snake moves to it.\n\nThen on turn t+1, life L-1, and so on.\n\nDisappears when life reaches 0.\n\nFor (2,1): life 9 at turn 17, can be eaten on turns 17 to 25 inclusive? On turn 17, if eaten, life decreases but eaten before? When eaten, life doesn't decrease further.\n\nBut for timing, it can be eaten as long as life >0 when the move happens.\n\nOn turn k, if at start life >0, and snake moves to it, eaten.\n\nLife decreases at start of turn before move? The rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but doesn't specify order.\n\nI think for safety, assume at start of turn, life decreases; if >0, food present; snake moves to it to eat.\n\nFor (2,1): life 9 at turn 17 (given), so on turn 17, after decrease to 8? The value is given at turn start.\n\nState input: at turn t, food has life span L, meaning it has L turns left including current.\n\nAfter current turn, it will have L-1 left.\n\nBut for eating, on turn t, if snake moves to food cell, it is eaten, and life span not decreased for that turn? Not specified.\n\nTo clarify: the rule says \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"can be eaten if head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nI think it's reasonable to assume that on each turn, first the life span decreases by 1 for all food, then if life span >0, food is present, and if snake moves to it, it is eaten.\n\nIf life span becomes 0 after decrease, food disappears and cannot be eaten.\n\nFor example, at turn t:\n\n- Decrease life span of all food by 1\n\n- If life span >0, food present; else, removed\n\n- Snake moves: if to a cell with present food, eats it\n\nIn this case, for (6,3) at turn 17: life 6, decrease to 5, >0, present. If snake at (6,3), eat, but not.\n\nAfter turn, life 5.\n\nTurn 18: decrease to 4, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn 21: decrease to 1 (6-5=1? Turn 17: dec to 5, turn 18 to 4, turn 19 to 3, turn 20 to 2, turn 21 to 1), present, snake can eat by moving to it.\n\nTurn 22: decrease to 0, removed.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1): turn 17: dec to 8, present; ... up to turn 25: dec to 0 (9-8=1 dec to 0), removed. So can be eaten on turn 24: dec to 1, present, eat.\n\nNow back to decision.\n\nFrom turn 17, only move to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: from (1,3), only move to (2,3) as earlier.\n\nAt (2,3) on turn 18, head at (2,3), direction east (since moved from (1,3) to (2,3)).\n\nPossible moves: south to (2,2) or east to (3,3), since north (2,4) wall, west (1,3) body.\n\nI need to choose which food to go for.\n\nIf I go east to (3,3) on turn 19, then I can reach (6,3) by turn 21 as above.\n\nIf I go south to (2,2) on turn 19, then to (2,1) on turn 20, eat (2,1), but then (6,3) might not be reachable by turn 21.\n\nFrom (2,1) on turn 20, to reach (6,3) by turn 21 is impossible, since (2,1) to (6,3) is |dx|=4, |dy|=2, min 6 moves, but only one turn left, turn 21, so cannot.\n\nThus, if I go south on turn 19, I miss (6,3).\n\nIf I go east on turn 19, I can get (6,3) on turn 21, and (2,1) can be gotten later since life longer.\n\nSo better to go for (6,3) first.\n\nBut is there a risk in going east?\n\nAlso, need to think about survival.\n\nAfter eating (6,3), I am at (6,3), with longer snake.\n\nThen I can go for (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), which might be accessible.\n\nNow, from (2,3) on turn 19, if I go to (3,3), then turn 20 to (4,3), turn 21 to (5,3), but to eat (6,3), I need to move to (6,3) on turn 21, so from (5,3) to (6,3).\n\nOn turn 21, at (5,3), move to (6,3).\n\nNow, (5,3) and (6,3) should be free, but let's check obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(6,3) not listed, (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) different.\n\nAlso, walls: x=7 is border, but x=6<7, so not border wall.\n\nSimilarly, y=3, not border.\n\nSo (6,3) free.\n\nWhen moving to (6,3), no issue.\n\nBut after that, snake has eaten, so length increases by 1.\n\nCurrent length 6, after eating (6,3), length 7.\n\nThen positions: when eat at (6,3) on turn 21, head to (6,3), tail doesn't move, so body includes previous positions.\n\nBut let's not list all now.\n\nNow, from there, I can go to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) can be eaten by turn 24, so I have time.\n\nBut need to find a path.\n\nFirst, let's outline the moves for the next few turns.\n\nTurn 17: must move down to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: from (1,3) to (2,3) - only choice, as west is wall, north body, south wall.\n\nAfter move to (1,3), head at (1,3), direction down? Moved down to (1,3), but from (1,4) to (1,3), so direction D.\n\nThen to (2,3), which is east, so changing direction to R.\n\nNow turn 19: at (2,3), I choose to move east to (3,3) to go towards (6,3)\n\nThen turn 20: from (3,3) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) to (5,3)? Earlier I said to (5,3) on turn 21, but from (4,3) to (5,3) is east.\n\nThen turn 22: to (6,3)? But on turn 22, food gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nOn turn 20: at (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) to (5,3)\n\nBut to eat (6,3), I need to be at (5,3) on turn 21 to move to (6,3) on turn 21.\n\nBut at turn 21 start, I am at (4,3), move to (5,3), so after move, at (5,3), but (6,3) is not eaten yet.\n\nThen on turn 22, food gone.\n\nI need to be at (6,3) on turn 21.\n\nSo I need to reach (5,3) by turn 20 to move to (6,3) on turn 21.\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3) move to (4,3), arrive at (4,3)\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,3) move to (5,3), arrive at (5,3), not (6,3).\n\nCannot reach (6,3) on turn 21 from here.\n\nPath from (2,3) to (6,3):\n\n(2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) — 4 moves.\n\nFrom turn 19 at (2,3) to turn 20 at (3,3), turn 21 at (4,3), turn 22 at (5,3), turn 23 at (6,3) but on turn 23, food life: turn 21 dec to 1, turn 22 dec to 0, gone, so on turn 22, at start dec to 0, gone, cannot eat on turn 22 or later.\n\nOn turn 21, life dec to 1, present, but I am at (4,3) on turn 21, move to (5,3), not to (6,3).\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,3) by turn 21 from (2,3) in fewer than 3 moves? (2,3) to (3,3) 1 move, (3,3) to (4,3) 2, (4,3) to (5,3) 3, (5,3) to (6,3) 4th move.\n\nMin 4 moves from (2,3) to (6,3).\n\nAt turn 19, I am at (2,3), so after 4 moves: turn 19 to (3,3), turn 20 to (4,3), turn 21 to (5,3), turn 22 to (6,3). But on turn 22, food gone, so I can only reach (5,3) on turn 21, but (6,3) is not reached.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,3) at all from this position? But that can't be right.\n\nPerhaps from (2,3) I can go via other path, but (2,4) is wall, so no, must go through (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) is the only path, and it takes 4 moves.\n\nBut I have only from turn 19 to turn 21, which is 3 turns: turn 19,20,21.\n\nOn turn 19 move, arrive at new position end of turn.\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3) move to new, say (3,3), at (3,3) end turn 19.\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3) move to (4,3), at (4,3) end.\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) move to (5,3), at (5,3) end.\n\nTo be at (6,3) on turn 21, I need to move there on turn 21, so I must be at an adjacent cell on turn 20 end.\n\nOn turn 20 end, I am at (4,3) or (3,3), not at (5,3) or (6,2) etc.\n\n(6,3) adjacent cells: (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, (6,2), (5,3), (7,3) but x=7 wall, so only (6,2) or (5,3).\n\n(6,2) might be free, but from where?\n\nIf I can be at (5,3) or (6,2) on turn 20, then move to (6,3) on turn 21.\n\nBut on turn 20, I am at (4,3) or earlier.\n\nFrom turn 19 at (2,3), on turn 20 I can be at (3,3) or (2,2) or (3,3) only, not (5,3).\n\nSo impossible to reach (6,3) by turn 21.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (6,3) because it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nLife span too short.\n\nAt turn 17, life 6, must be eaten by turn 21, but from (1,4) to (6,3) is at least 5 moves: (1,4) to (1,3) turn 17, (1,3) to (2,3) turn 18, (2,3) to (3,3) turn 19, (3,3) to (4,3) turn 20, (4,3) to (5,3) turn 21, then (5,3) to (6,3) turn 22 too late.\n\nAnd no shorter path.\n\nSo (6,3) cannot be eaten, so I should ignore it and go for (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has life 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSo on turn 19, from (2,3), I should move south to (2,2) to go to (2,1).\n\nThen turn 20 to (2,1), eat.\n\nThen from there, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut there might be other food or I need to survive.\n\nBut only two food, both positive, but (6,3) will disappear soon.\n\nSo for turn 17: move to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: move to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 19: move south to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: move south to (2,1), eat food.\n\nThen after that, head at (2,1), direction south.\n\nNow, from (2,1), possible moves.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- North: (2,2) - will be occupied by body after move? After eating at (2,1), positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — since ate, tail didn't move, so body includes (2,2), which is north.\n\nSo moving north to (2,2) would be to body, collision.\n\n- South: (2,0) - but y=0 is border wall, invalid\n\n- East: (3,1) - not obstacle? (3,1) free? Obstacles not listed, so free\n\n- West: (1,1) - not obstacle, free? But (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) might be free, but y=1, x=1.\n\n(1,1) not listed as obstacle, not border, so free.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) should be accessible.\n\nBut to move to (1,1), from (2,1) west.\n\nPossible moves: east to (3,1) or west to (1,1), since north body, south wall.\n\nThen I can choose.\n\nBut for now, since I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions from turn 17 onwards for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but answer format is to list actions starting from current turn.\n\nBut I don't know how many to list, but probably for the immediate future.\n\nSince (6,3) is unreachable, I should focus on (2,1).\n\nAlso, after eating (2,1), I need to find a safe path.\n\nBut let's list the moves.\n\nFirst, on turn 17: only choice, move down to (1,3)\n\nTurn 18: from (1,3) to (2,3) - only choice\n\nNow turn 19: from (2,3), I can move south to (2,2) or east to (3,3). Since (6,3) unreachable, I go south to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 20: from (2,2) to (2,1), eat food.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 21, at (2,1), I can move east to (3,1) or west to (1,1).\n\nWhich is better?\n\nFirst, let's see the grid for long-term survival.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, so at y=1, (5,1) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,1), if I move east to (3,1), then from there, I can go north to (3,2), since (3,1) to (3,2) up, but (3,2) free? Obstacles not listed, so free.\n\nThen to (3,3), etc.\n\nIf move west to (1,1), then from (1,1), I can go north to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, or east to (2,1) but body, or south to (1,0) wall, so only north is blocked, so from (1,1), only possible move is east back to (2,1) or south invalid, so stuck? (1,1) adjacent: (1,2) north obstacle, (1,0) south wall, (0,1) west wall, (2,1) east but occupied by body after move? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 20, at (2,1), positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — length 7 now.\n\nOn turn 21, from (2,1), move to (3,1) or (1,1).\n\nIf move to (1,1): (1,1) is free? Not obstacle, so move to (1,1).\n\nThen positions: head to (1,1), since no food, tail moves? No, when moving, if no food, tail moves.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1) on turn 20, positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail at (2,6).\n\nOn turn 21, move to (1,1): no food at (1,1), so tail moves, new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail (2,6) removed, new tail (2,5).\n\nNow, at (1,1), possible moves:\n\n- North: (1,2) - obstacle, invalid\n\n- South: (1,0) - y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- East: (2,1) - occupied by body (segment at (2,1)), not tail, so collision\n\n- West: (0,1) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\nSo all moves invalid! Trapped and die.\n\nTherefore, moving to (1,1) on turn 21 is deadly.\n\nMust not go to (1,1).\n\nInstead, on turn 21, from (2,1), move east to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) should be free.\n\nThen positions: head to (3,1), no food, tail moves, so new positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,6) removed? After move to (3,1), tail (2,6) removed, so body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail (2,5).\n\nList: head (3,1), then previous head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — and (2,6) gone. Tail at (2,5).\n\nNow at (3,1), possible moves:\n\n- North: (3,2) - not obstacle, free\n\n- South: (3,0) - y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- East: (4,1) - but (4,1) free? Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not, so free\n\n- West: (2,1) - occupied by body, collision\n\nSo can move north to (3,2) or east to (4,1).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nFor example, to (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nBut need to think about the future.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor now, on turn 19, I go to (2,2), then turn 20 to (2,1).\n\nBut on turn 21, from (2,1), I must move east to (3,1) to avoid death.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,2) or (4,1).\n\n(3,2) is north, (4,1) east.\n\nIf I go to (3,2), then from there to (3,3), etc.\n\n(4,1) might lead to area with obstacles.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles: (5,1) obstacle, (5,2) obstacle, so at (4,1), if I go east to (5,1) invalid, so must go north to (4,2), then from (4,2), can go to (4,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,2), to (3,3), (4,2), etc.\n\nSo both possible.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to list actions starting from turn 17.\n\nSo for turn 17: D (down to (1,3))\n\nTurn 18: R (right to (2,3)) since from (1,3) to (2,3) is east, R.\n\nThen turn 19: D (down to (2,2)) since south to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 20: D (down to (2,1), eat)\n\nThen turn 21: from (2,1), move R (east to (3,1))\n\nThen turn 22: from (3,1), I can move U (up to (3,2)) or R (east to (4,1))\n\nSay, move U to (3,2) for example.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the format is to list actions, and think ahead, but for now, up to turn 21 or so.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 19, moving south is possible.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,2): is (2,2) free? Yes, not obstacle, not occupied.\n\nThen to (2,1), free except food.\n\nAlso, no tail reward danger.\n\nSimilarly, after that, moving to (3,1) is safe.\n\nNow, about the food (6,3), since I can't reach it, I ignore it.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D  // to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: D  // to (2,1), eat\n\nThen for turn 21: R // to (3,1)\n\nI can list a few more.\n\nTurn 22: from (3,1), move U to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 23: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), or R to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, listing until turn 21 or 22 is fine.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but answer format lists actions starting from current turn for multiple turns.\n\nProbably list for about 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 17, so up to turn 21 or 22.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 17 to 21 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 17,18,19,20,21: 5 actions.\n\nSo I can output that.\n\nBut on turn 19, I chose D to go to (2,2), but I could go east, but since (6,3) unreachable, better to go for (2,1).\n\nPerhaps there is negative food or something, but no, only positive.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nThen for the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be in a box.\n\nAlso, need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nNow, for turn 21, from (2,1) to (3,1), which is east, so R.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think that's the plan.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 17, the snake must prioritize long-term survival while maximizing score by eating positive food. After evaluating the grid, obstacles, food positions, and life spans, the only viable immediate move from (1,4) is down (D) to (1,3) due to walls and body collisions blocking other directions. From there, the path to (2,1) is safe and achievable within the food's life span, while (6,3) cannot be reached before it disappears (life span too short; must be eaten by turn 21 but requires at least 5 moves from (1,4), which is not possible by turn 21).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 17 Movement**: From (1,4), only (1,3) is free (not wall or body collision). Moving down (D) is the only option.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (6,3) has life span 6 at turn 17, decreasing to 0 by turn 22. Reaching it requires 4 moves from (2,3) (turn 19 position), but only 3 moves are available by turn 21, making it impossible to eat.\n  - (2,1) has life span 9 at turn 17, decreasing to 0 by turn 25, so it can be eaten later (e.g., by turn 20). Eating it increases length by 1.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating (2,1), moving east to (3,1) avoids a dead end at (1,1). Other paths are evaluated for safety.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: Actions are planned for turns 17 to 21 to eat (2,1) and avoid risks, with further moves ensuring open space.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 17-21):\n- **Turn 17**: Move D (down) to (1,3) – Only safe move from (1,4); no food eaten.\n- **Turn 18**: Move R (right) to (2,3) – Only safe move from (1,3); sets path to (2,1).\n- **Turn 19**: Move D (down) to (2,2) – Moves toward (2,1); avoids east to (3,3) since (6,3) is unreachable.\n- **Turn 20**: Move D (down) to (2,1) – Eats positive food; length increases to 7.\n- **Turn 21**: Move R (right) to (3,1) – Avoids west to (1,1) (dead end); ensures access to open area.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 21):\n- From (3,1), possible moves include U (up) to (3,2) or R (right) to (4,1), both safe with no immediate threats. The grid has space for navigation, and no other food is present, so survival is maintained by avoiding obstacles and body collisions.\n\nThis plan eats one positive food, increases length, and ensures survival for at least 5 turns. If new food spawns, reassess based on state.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: D \\\\\nTurn 18: R \\\\\nTurn 19: D \\\\\nTurn 20: D \\\\\nTurn 21: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 18, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls and obstacles, and there's food with values and life spans.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n- Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so I can't go there. Internal obstacles are given: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). I should list all the blocked cells for clarity.\n\nBlocked cells:\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7 for y in 0-7; all y=0, y=7 for x in 0-7.\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo, combining, any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, or one of the internal points is blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\nHead at (1,3), then body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So the snake has 6 segments. Head is at (1,3), and the direction is down (D). Since the head is moving down, from (1,3) down would be to (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle? Let's see.\n\nHead direction is given as D, meaning the snake was moving down to reach (1,3)? No, the positions are current positions, and head direction is the direction it's facing now. So snake positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nWith head at (1,3) and direction D (down). That means from the previous position, it moved down to (1,3). Let's think about the movement.\n\nThe head is at (1,3), and it's facing down, so it came from (1,4)? But (1,4) is the second segment. Positions are listed head first: index 0 is head (1,3), index 1 is (1,4), which is the segment just behind the head, and so on, up to tail at (3,6).\n\nSince head direction is D, that means in the last move, it moved down to (1,3), so it was at (1,4) before moving down to (1,3). But (1,4) is now the body. Yes.\n\nNow, possible moves: I can move up (U), down (D), left (L), right (R), but with constraints.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,3)\n\nPossible moves from here:\n- Up (U): to (1,4) — but (1,4) is occupied by the snake's body. Is that a collision? Body collision: head touches any body segment. (1,4) is a body segment, so moving to (1,4) would cause collision and death. So I cannot move up to (1,4).\n\n- Down (D): to (1,2) — but (1,2) is listed as an internal obstacle. So it's blocked, cannot move there.\n\n- Left (L): to (0,3) — but x=0 is a border wall, so cannot move there.\n\n- Right (R): to (2,3) — is (2,3) free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,2), (2,4), etc.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\n- Borders: all (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo (1,2) is blocked, (2,4) is blocked, etc.\n\nNow, (2,3): is it occupied or blocked?\n\nSnake: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — so (2,3) is not in snake positions.\n\nObstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed. Walls: x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7 — (2,3) is x=2, y=3, not border, and not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles are specific points, so (2,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nBut I can only move to adjacent cells: up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n- U: (1,4) — occupied by snake body (segment 1), so collision, invalid.\n- D: (1,2) — internal obstacle, blocked, invalid.\n- L: (0,3) — border wall, invalid.\n- R: (2,3) — seems free, no snake or obstacle.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (2,3).\n\nBut is that safe? Moving to (2,3) — head goes to (2,3), and since it's a move, the tail will move away from (3,6), so the body segments shift.\n\nAfter moving right to (2,3), the new positions would be: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail was (3,6), but since we move, the tail moves to (2,6)? Let's see how snake moves.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail is removed unless we eat food.\n\nSo from current: positions: [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nAfter move right to (2,3): new head at (2,3), then body: (1,3) becomes the new segment 1, (1,4) becomes segment 2, (1,5) becomes segment 3, (2,5) becomes segment 4, (2,6) becomes segment 5, and tail (3,6) is removed because no food eaten. So new positions: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] — tail is now (2,6).\n\n(3,6) is gone.\n\nNow, (2,3) was free, so no collision. Also, no wall or obstacle.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food.\n\n**Food:**\n- (6,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n- (2,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1.\n\nLife span: for (6,3), it has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 18, so for (6,3), life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 18 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t when food is present, life_span is given, and it decreases each turn. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N it is gone.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span = N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nLook: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it means: at the start of turn, if life_span > 0, it is present; after the turn, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span becomes 0, after that turn it disappears.\n\nBut for the purpose of eating, it can be eaten during the turn if head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, turn 18, food (6,3) has life_span 5, so it will disappear after turn 22? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 18: life_span 5\n\nAfter turn 18, life_span decreases to 4? Or before?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nPerhaps at the beginning of turn, the life_span is the remaining turns.\n\nStandard: when the state is given at turn t, the life_span is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn, so after turn t, it will have life_span - 1, and so on, until life_span becomes 0 after which it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span = N, then it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1.\n\nAfter turn t+N-1, it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, here turn 18, (6,3) life_span 5, so it will be available until turn 22? Turns: t=18: available, after turn 18, life_span=4; t=19: available, after life_span=3; ... t=22: available with life_span=1, after turn 22, life_span=0, gone. So it can be eaten on turns 18 to 22.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life_span 8, available until turn 25.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nCurrently, from (1,3), only possible move is right to (2,3), as we saw.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nEarlier: U to (1,4) body, collision; D to (1,2) obstacle; L to (0,3) wall; R to (2,3) free.\n\nYes.\n\nBut after moving to (2,3), what next?\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead, as per instruction.\n\nAlso, food positions: (6,3) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\nCurrently head at (1,3), moving to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), where can I go?\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is an internal obstacle! Yes, (2,4) is listed in internal obstacles: (2,4) is blocked.\n\n- D: to (2,2) — is it free? Snake positions: after move, head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(2,2) not occupied, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5) — so (2,2) is free.\n\n- L: to (1,3) — but (1,3) is now the body segment (segment 1 after move), so occupied, collision.\n\n- R: to (3,3) — is it free? (3,3) not in snake, not obstacle. Obstacles have (3,5), but not (3,3). Walls not. So free.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: but current head direction after move to (2,3) would be R (right), since we moved right.\n\nOriginal head direction was D, but after moving R, new direction is R.\n\n\"No instant reverse\" means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n\nBut for now, from (2,3), possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3), since U and L are blocked or occupied.\n\nU to (2,4) obstacle, L to (1,3) body, so only D or R.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) and (6,3).\n\n(2,1) is below (2,2), so if I go down to (2,2), then I can go down to (2,1) to eat it.\n\nBut (2,1) is positive food, value +1.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is far away.\n\nBut I need to consider risks.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is not on food.\n\nCurrent tail: after move to (2,3), tail is at (2,6), I think.\n\nPositions after move: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] so tail at (2,6)\n\nFood is at (2,1) and (6,3), neither is under tail.\n\n(2,6) has no food.\n\nNow, from (2,3), if I move D to (2,2), then head at (2,2), body: [ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] and tail at (2,5)? Let's see: after moving to (2,2), head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes segment 1, then (1,3) seg2, (1,4) seg3, (1,5) seg4, (2,5) seg5, and (2,6) removed.\n\nSo positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move to (2,1) to eat food.\n\n(2,1) is free? Not occupied, not obstacle. Obstacles: (1,2) and (5,1), etc., but (2,1) not listed, so free.\n\nIf I move to (2,1), I eat the food, since it's positive, snake grows: so new head at (2,1), then body adds a segment, so positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — and since I ate, length increases, so tail stays or what?\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't shorten; you keep the tail and add a segment.\n\nIn terms of positions: after move without eating, tail is removed. When eating, tail is not removed; new head position, and all body segments shift, so the tail remains and a new segment is added at the head.\n\nPositions: after move to (2,1) and eat, head at (2,1), then the previous head (2,2) becomes body, so [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] — so now 7 segments, tail at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, is there any danger? The food at (2,1) is positive, and I ate it, but tail is at (2,5), not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (2,1), tail at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, I need to get to (2,1).\n\nFrom current, turn 18: only move is R to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 20: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nBut after that, where am I?\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nNow, possible moves: from (2,1)\n\n- U: to (2,2) — but (2,2) is body segment, occupied? Positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\n(2,2) is segment 1, so moving up to (2,2) would collide with body.\n\n- D: to (2,0) — but y=0 is border wall, cannot.\n\n- L: to (1,1) — is it free? (1,1) not occupied, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed. Borders: y=0, but (1,1) y=1 not 0. So should be free.\n\n- R: to (3,1) — (3,1) not occupied, not obstacle. Obstacles have (3,5), not (3,1).\n\nSo possible moves L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere's another food at (6,3), which is to the right.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, after eating (2,1), I might be stuck or something.\n\n(2,1) is at bottom, y=1, and below is wall.\n\nFrom (2,1), if I go left to (1,1), then from (1,1), where can I go?\n\n(1,1): possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,2) — but (1,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle, blocked.\n\n- D: to (1,0) — y=0 wall, blocked.\n\n- L: to (0,1) — x=0 wall, blocked.\n\n- R: to (2,1) — but (2,1) is now body segment? After moving to (1,1), positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nIf I move to (1,1), head to (1,1), body: [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ]? Let's trace.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\nThen from (2,1), move L to (1,1): new head (1,1), body: (2,1) becomes segment 1, (2,2) seg2, (2,3) seg3, (1,3) seg4, (1,4) seg5, (1,5) seg6, and since no eat, tail (2,5) removed. So positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) ] — tail at (1,4).\n\nNow from (1,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,2) — obstacle, blocked.\n\n- D: (1,0) — wall, blocked.\n\n- L: (0,1) — wall, blocked.\n\n- R: (2,1) — but (2,1) is now body segment (segment 1), so moving to it causes collision.\n\nAll directions blocked! Death.\n\nIf from (2,1) I move R to (3,1) instead.\n\nThen head to (3,1), body: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] — since tail was (2,5), removed, but after eating, we have 7 segments, so positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ]? After move from (2,1) to (3,1), no eat, so tail removed: the last segment (2,5) is removed, so body: (2,1) becomes segment 1, but (2,1) was head, now it's body, so positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) but (1,5) was segment 6, and tail was (2,5), which is removed, so the segments are: index 0: head (2,1) before move, after move to (3,1), head (3,1), then previous positions except tail: so the body segments are the old segments from index 1 to end, but since no eat, we remove the tail.\n\nOld positions before move: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] — segments 0 to 6.\n\nAfter move to (3,1) without eating, new head at (3,1), then the body becomes the old head and body except the tail: so [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] — and (2,5) removed. But (1,5) was segment 5, now segment 6, and (1,4) segment 5, etc.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then seg1: (2,1), seg2: (2,2), seg3: (2,3), seg4: (1,3), seg5: (1,4), seg6: (1,5) — tail at (1,5).\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,2) — free? (3,2) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n- D: to (3,0) — y=0 wall, blocked.\n\n- L: to (2,1) — but (2,1) is body segment (seg1), occupied, collision.\n\n- R: to (4,1) — (4,1) should be free, no obstacle.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: (3,5) is obstacle, but not (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nSo U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut the point is, if I go to eat (2,1) immediately, from (2,1) if I go left to (1,1), I die, but if I go right to (3,1), I might survive.\n\nBut in the path where I go to (1,1), it's dead end.\n\nSo I should avoid that.\n\nBut in the sequence to eat (2,1), I don't have to go to (1,1); I can go to (3,1) after eating.\n\nBut let's see if eating (2,1) is the best.\n\nThere is another food at (6,3), which is closer in x, but y is same, x from 2 to 6.\n\n(6,3) at x=6,y=3.\n\nCurrently at (1,3), if I go right, I can reach it.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, from (1,3), only move R to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then to (2,1) to eat, but as above, might be risky if I go left.\n\nBut I can go to (3,1) after.\n\nPerhaps eating (2,1) is not urgent; it has life span 8, so many turns left.\n\n(6,3) has life span 5, so it might disappear sooner.\n\nTurn 18, (6,3) life span 5, so available until turn 22 (since turn 18,19,20,21,22 it exists, gone after 22).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 8, until turn 25.\n\nSo (6,3) is more urgent to eat if possible.\n\nNow, can I reach (6,3) from here?\n\nFrom (1,3) to (6,3), but with obstacles.\n\nPath: from (1,3) to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (4,3), but (4,3) is free? Then to (5,3), but (5,3) might be free, obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) not listed.\n\nThen to (6,3), but (6,3) is the food position.\n\nBut is there a path?\n\n(6,3) is at x=6,y=3, but internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,3) is food, so it should be accessible, unless snake is on it or something.\n\nBut let's see the grid around.\n\nAlso, wall at x=7, but (6,3) is x=6, not wall.\n\nNow, from (3,3) to (4,3): (4,3) should be free.\n\nThen (5,3): obstacles include (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) not, so free.\n\nThen (6,3): food.\n\nBut when moving to (6,3), I eat it.\n\nNow, are there obstacles in between?\n\nFor example, from (1,3) to (2,3) free.\n\n(2,3) to (3,3): (3,3) free, no issue.\n\n(3,3) to (4,3): (4,3) free.\n\n(4,3) to (5,3): (5,3) free.\n\n(5,3) to (6,3): (6,3) is food, but is there obstacle? (6,3) is the food cell, so it should be free to move to, except if occupied, but it's not occupied by snake now.\n\nSnake is at (1,3) etc., not at (6,3).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but not (6,3), so it should be accessible.\n\n(6,3) is listed as food, so not obstacle.\n\nSo I can go directly right to (6,3) in 5 moves: from (1,3) to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).\n\nBut from (1,3) to (2,3) is one move, turn 18.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (3,3) turn 19.\n\nThen to (4,3) turn 20.\n\nTo (5,3) turn 21.\n\nTo (6,3) turn 22.\n\nNow, (6,3) life span 5 at turn 18, so at turn 22, it should still be there? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 18, life span 5.\n\nAfter turn 18, it decreases to 4? Or at the end of turn.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think at the beginning of each turn, the life span is the remaining turns.\n\nAt turn 18, life span 5, so it can be eaten on turn 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nAfter turn 22, it disappears.\n\nSo on turn 22, I can eat it.\n\nIf I go directly, I reach on turn 22 and eat it.\n\nBut I need to check if the path is safe.\n\nFirst, turn 18: move R to (2,3).\n\nPositions after: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6)\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3), move R to (3,3).\n\nNew head (3,3), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail (2,6) removed? No eat, so positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is tail.\n\nNow, (3,3) to (4,3): is (4,3) free? Yes.\n\nBut direction: after moving R to (3,3), head direction R.\n\nTurn 20: move R to (4,3).\n\nNew head (4,3), body: [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] — tail (2,5) removed, so positions: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (1,3), seg4 (1,4), seg5 (1,5) tail at (1,5)\n\n(2,5) was removed.\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3), move R to (5,3).\n\nNew head (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — and (1,5) removed? Positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) ] tail at (1,4)\n\nTurn 22: from (5,3), move R to (6,3) to eat food.\n\nNew head (6,3), and since eat, grow, so positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) ] — new tail at (1,4), length 7.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves: from (6,3)\n\n- U: to (6,4) — but (6,4) is internal obstacle! Blocked.\n\n- D: to (6,2) — (6,2) free? Not obstacle, not wall. Obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, (6,4) obstacle, but (6,2) and (6,3) not, (6,3) is head now.\n\n(6,2) should be free.\n\n- L: to (5,3) — but (5,3) is body segment (seg1), occupied, collision.\n\n- R: to (7,3) — x=7 wall, blocked.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,2), since U and R blocked, L occupied.\n\nD to (6,2) should be free.\n\nThen move to (6,2).\n\nBut after that, I need to survive.\n\n(6,2) is at bottom, y=2, above y=1 which has obstacle at (6,1), but (6,2) ok.\n\nFrom there, I can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut the point is, I can reach and eat (6,3) on turn 22.\n\nNow, what about the other food (2,1)? It has longer life, I can get it later.\n\nBut after eating (6,3), I am at (6,3), then to (6,2), etc., and (2,1) is far.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating both is good.\n\nNow, is there a risk in going to (2,1) first?\n\nEarlier, if I go to (2,1) on turn 20, I eat it, but then from (2,1), I have to move to (3,1) to avoid death, as going to (1,1) is death.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go to (4,1), etc., but to reach (6,3), it might take longer.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) to (3,1) turn 19? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 18: move R to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,3), move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) eat food.\n\nNow positions: after eat, [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]? After move to (2,1) and eat, head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (2,5) since grow, tail at (2,5).\n\nTurn 20: head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nThen I must move, say R to (3,1) to avoid left which is dead end.\n\nMove R to (3,1): new head (3,1), body: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] tail at (1,5) since no eat, (2,5) removed? After move without eat, tail removed.\n\nOld positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (3,1) no eat: head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — and (2,5) removed. Tail at (1,5).\n\nNow from (3,1), as before, U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,3), I need to go up to y=3.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) to (4,3) etc., to (6,3).\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nFor instance, turn 21: from (3,1) move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 22: from (3,2) move U to (3,3) — but (3,3) might be free, but obstacle at (3,5), not (3,3).\n\nThen turn 23: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 24: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 25: to (6,3)\n\nBut on turn 25, (6,3) might be gone. Life span: at turn 18, life span 5, so after turn 22 it disappears. Turn 25 is too late.\n\nEven if I go directly from (3,1) to (4,1) then up, but (4,1) might be free, but I need to go to y=3.\n\nShortest path: from (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3), that's 5 moves, from turn 21 to 25, but (6,3) gone after turn 22, so I miss it.\n\nIf I go right first from (3,1) to (4,1), then to (4,2), to (4,3), etc., still similar.\n\nSo if I eat (2,1) first, I cannot reach (6,3) in time to eat it before it disappears.\n\nWhereas if I go directly to (6,3), I eat it on turn 22, just in time.\n\nThen I can go for (2,1) later, which has life span until turn 25.\n\nAfter eating (6,3), I am at (6,3) on turn 22, then move to (6,2) on turn 23? Turn 22 I eat at (6,3), then on turn 23, from (6,3) I move to (6,2), as only choice.\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (6,3) — but (6,3) is where I was, now body? Positions after turn 22: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail at (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (6,2) on turn 23: head to (6,2), no eat, so tail removed: new positions [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) ] tail at (1,3)\n\nNow from (6,2):\n\n- U: to (6,3) — but (6,3) is now body segment (seg1), occupied, collision.\n\n- D: to (6,1) — but (6,1) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n\n- L: to (5,2) — (5,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,2), yes, blocked.\n\n- R: to (7,2) — x=7 wall, blocked.\n\nAll moves blocked! Death at (6,2).\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3) and moving to (6,2), I have no moves; all adjacent cells blocked or occupied.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nU to (6,3): body segment\n\nD to (6,1): obstacle\n\nL to (5,2): obstacle (since (5,2) in list)\n\nR to (7,2): wall\n\nSo indeed, stuck and die.\n\nTherefore, going directly to (6,3) leads to death on the next turn.\n\nNot good.\n\nI need a different path to (6,3) that allows me to escape after eating.\n\nCurrently, from (6,3), I can only go down to (6,2), but that is a dead end.\n\nIs there another way to approach (6,3)?\n\nFor example, instead of going straight right, maybe go around.\n\nBut from the left, the only access is from (5,3) to (6,3), since above (6,4) is obstacle, below (6,2) might be accessible, but from below.\n\n(6,3) can be approached from left, right, up, or down, but right is wall, up is obstacle, down is (6,2), which might be accessible if I come from there.\n\nBut in this case, I came from left, so after eating, only down is possible, but down leads to dead end.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (6,3) from the left; maybe approach from above or below.\n\nBut below (6,2) is free, but (6,1) obstacle, so from below I can go to (6,2) then to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, from above, (6,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nSo only from left or below.\n\nCurrently, from left is the way, but after eating, I need an exit.\n\nSo if I go to (6,3) from below, that might work.\n\nFor example, go to (6,2) first, then to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,2) is not food, just a cell.\n\nLet's see if I can go to (6,2) before (6,3).\n\nBut (6,2) might be free.\n\nNow, from current position, how to reach (6,2) or (6,3) from a different direction.\n\nCurrently at (1,3), I need to go right but avoid the dead end after eating.\n\nPerhaps I can go down or something first.\n\nBut from (1,3), only right is possible now.\n\nSo turn 18: must go R to (2,3)\n\nThen from (2,3), instead of going directly right, I could go down to (2,2), then right or something.\n\nBut (2,2) is free.\n\nLet's plan a path to (6,3) that allows escape.\n\nFor example, go to (6,3) from below, so after eating, I can go up or left, but up is obstacle, so only left.\n\nBut if I come from below, from (6,2) to (6,3), then after eating, head at (6,3), and I can go left to (5,3), but (5,3) is the body if I came from there, so collision.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nSuppose I go to (6,2) first.\n\nHow to get to (6,2) from (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3), etc., but need to go down at some point.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) go to (3,3), then to (3,2), but (3,2) free? Then to (4,2), (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (5,2), so cannot go to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is blocked.\n\nSo path through y=2 might be blocked.\n\nList free cells.\n\nPerhaps go to (4,3) then to (4,2) or something.\n\nAnother idea: since after eating at (6,3), if I could go down to (6,2), but from there I can go left to (5,2), but (5,2) obstacle, so not possible.\n\nUnless I don't go to (6,2) immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (6,3) at all, if it leads to death.\n\nBut it's positive food, so I should eat it if possible without dying.\n\nMaybe there is a way to have the tail not block the exit.\n\nBut in this case, the snake is long, and the area is tight.\n\nAnother thought: when I eat at (6,3), the tail is at (1,4) or something, far away, but the immediate adjacent cells are limited.\n\nFrom (6,3), only (6,2) is free, but after moving to (6,2), the body is at (6,3), so (6,3) occupied, and other cells blocked.\n\nSo no escape.\n\nTherefore, eating (6,3) from the left is suicidal.\n\nI need to avoid that food or find another way.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (2,1) first, and forget about (6,3), but (6,3) is positive, and I can eat it if I approach differently, but I don't see how.\n\nMaybe from (2,3), I go down to (2,2), then to (3,2), but (3,2) free, then to (4,2), but (4,2) free? Then to (5,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nGo to (4,3) then to (4,4) or something, but (4,4) free? Then to (5,4), etc., but (6,3) is at y=3, so I need to go down later.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,1).\n\n(2,1) has value +1, and I can eat it safely if I don't go to (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), after eating, I can go right to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\n(4,1) free? Then to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, blocked.\n\n(5,1) is internal obstacle.\n\nSo from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut as before, (6,3) will be gone by the time I reach.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (2,1) now, and ignore (6,3) since it's risky.\n\nBut let's check if (6,3) can be eaten without dying.\n\nSuppose I go to (5,3) but not eat immediately, then go down to (5,2), but (5,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nGo to (6,3) from (6,4), but (6,4) obstacle.\n\nSo no, I think it's impossible to eat (6,3) safely from any direction, because the only access is from left or below, and after eating, only down or left is possible, but both lead to issues.\n\nFrom below: if I go to (6,2) first, then to (6,3).\n\nFor example, turn 18: R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: D to (2,2)  -- but from (2,3) to (2,2) is down.\n\nThen turn 20: R to (3,2) -- (3,2) free\n\nTurn 21: R to (4,2) -- (4,2) free\n\nTurn 22: U to (4,3) -- (4,3) free\n\nTurn 23: R to (5,3) -- (5,3) free\n\nTurn 24: R to (6,3) eat -- but on turn 24, (6,3) life span: at turn 18 life span 5, so after turn 22 it disappears, so on turn 24 it's gone, cannot eat.\n\nToo late.\n\nIf I go faster, but from (2,2) to (3,2) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) is 5 moves from turn 19 to 24, but turn 19 to 24 is 6 turns? Turn 19: to (2,2), turn 20: to (3,2), turn 21: to (4,2), turn 22: to (4,3), turn 23: to (5,3), turn 24: to (6,3), but turn 22 is when it disappears after, so on turn 22 it is gone, so turn 24 no food.\n\nAt turn 21, I am at (4,2), not close to (6,3).\n\nSo I cannot reach in time except by the direct path, which kills me later.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to avoid (6,3) and go for (2,1).\n\nThen, after eating (2,1), I can explore other areas for more food, but currently only two food, and no new food spawn mentioned, so perhaps only these two.\n\nThe state has only these food, so I need to eat them or survive.\n\nBut if I eat (2,1), I can survive longer.\n\nNow, back to turn 18, only move R to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I go R to (3,3), then as before, I might be tempted to go to (6,3) but it's deadly, so I should not.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to other places.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I can go U to (3,4), but (3,4) free? Obstacles: (3,5) is obstacle, but (3,4) not, so free.\n\nThen to (3,5) but (3,5) obstacle, cannot.\n\nGo to (4,4) etc.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nFood at (2,1) is below.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go D to (3,2), then to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), so I need to go left and down.\n\nBut let's plan to eat (2,1).\n\nFrom current:\n\nTurn 18: R to (2,3)  -- only choice\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3), move D to (2,2)  -- since if I go R to (3,3), I might not get to (2,1) easily.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I go D to (2,2), then turn 20: D to (2,1) eat.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen after eating at (2,1), turn 20, head (2,1), direction down.\n\nThen I must move R to (3,1) to avoid death, as L to (1,1) is dead end.\n\nTurn 21: move R to (3,1)\n\nNow positions: after move, no eat, so tail removed. Before move, positions after eat: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (3,1): head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  -- and (2,5) removed. Tail at (1,5)\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1)\n\nSay I go U to (3,2) turn 21\n\nThen from (3,2), turn 22: U to (3,3)  -- (3,3) free\n\nThen from (3,3), turn 23: R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 24: R to (5,3)  -- (5,3) free\n\nTurn 25: R to (6,3) but (6,3) is gone, as life span ended after turn 22.\n\nNo food there.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to other directions, but no other food.\n\nSo I ate one food, and survive.\n\nBut I can explore the grid for possible new food, but the state doesn't say new food spawns, so perhaps only existing food.\n\nThe problem is to maximize score, so eating one is better than none, but eating both is better, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to eat (2,1) and then something else, but only two food.\n\nAnother idea: when I go to (2,3), I go to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc., but instead of eating (6,3), I stop at (5,3) and go down or up, but no food.\n\nSo I think the best is to eat (2,1) and survive.\n\nBut let's confirm if from (2,3), going down is safe.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,2): (2,2) free.\n\nThen to (2,1): eat.\n\nThen to (3,1): safe.\n\nThen I can move around.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) to (3,2), then to (4,2), but (4,2) free, then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut no more food, so score is 1.\n\nIf I don't eat any, score 0, worse.\n\nBut (6,3) is available, but I can't eat it safely.\n\nUnless I can eat it and have a way out, but I don't see.\n\nPerhaps the tail will move, but in the direct path, after eating at (6,3), the tail is at (1,4), which is far, but the local cells are blocked.\n\nSo I think it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, I should go for (2,1).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for several turns.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nt1=18.\n\nSo for turn 18: action\n\nTurn 19: action\n\netc.\n\nBut I don't know how many to output; probably until I eat or something.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the food has life span, I need to specify.\n\nBut in this case, let's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 18: from (1,3), move R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3), move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nThen after that, on turn 21, from (2,1), move R to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 22, from (3,1), move U to (3,2)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 20 or so.\n\nSince it says \"maximize score\", and I eat one food, it's ok.\n\nBut is there negative food? No, both positive.\n\nIn the state, both are value 1, positive.\n\nSo eating (2,1) is good.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid both and survive longer, but no other food, so score 0, worse.\n\nSo eating one is better.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFrom turn 18 to 22.\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 20: D (to (2,1) eat)\n\nThen turn 21: R (to (3,1))\n\nTurn 22: U (to (3,2))\n\nBut on turn 22, from (3,1) to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 19, from (2,3), I could go R to (3,3), but then I might not eat (2,1), and (6,3) is risky.\n\nIf I go to (3,3), then to (4,3), I might go to (5,3), but (6,3) deadly, so I can stop at (5,3) and go to (5,4) or something, but no food.\n\nThen (2,1) has life span 8, so I can go back down to eat it later.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) go to (5,4) if possible, but obstacles.\n\n(5,4) free? Then to (4,4), etc., but to go to (2,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nFor instance, from (5,3) to (4,3), to (3,3), to (3,2), to (3,1), to (2,1), but (2,1) might be eaten or not, but I am the only snake, so it remains until eaten or expired.\n\nLife span 8, so available until turn 25.\n\nBut from (5,3) to (2,1) is 3 steps left and 2 down, but not direct, so several turns.\n\nBut I can do it.\n\nBut in terms of score, I eat one food either way.\n\nBut if I go directly to (2,1) now, I eat on turn 20, score increases early.\n\nIf I go to (3,3) first, I eat later, but same score.\n\nBut with risk of missing if I delay.\n\nBut since no other threats, it should be fine.\n\nBut to be efficient, eating sooner is better, as I can be free.\n\nBut in this case, I think both options are ok, but since (6,3) is not eatable safely, I should go for (2,1).\n\nMoreover, in the direct path to (6,3), I die after eating, so score is 1 but I die, whereas eating (2,1) I survive with score 1.\n\nBetter to survive.\n\nSo I think going for (2,1) is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 18: R (right)\n\nTurn 19: D (down) to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: D (down) to (2,1) eat\n\nThen for later turns, I can add, but perhaps output up to turn 20 or 22.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify several.\n\nSince I ate on turn 20, and after that I move to (3,1) on turn 21, etc.\n\nBut for the box, I can put 3 or 4 actions.\n\nLet's see the core rules: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably output 5 actions or so.\n\nCurrent turn 18, so up to turn 22 or 23.\n\nBut I don't have to specify until the end, just a sequence.\n\nSo for turn 18 to 22.\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: R (to (3,1))\n\nTurn 22: U (to (3,2))\n\nOn turn 22, from (3,1) to (3,2), as I said.\n\nAnd from (3,2), I can go to (4,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nThen turn 21: from (2,1) after eating, move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 22: from (3,1) move U to (3,2)\n\netc.\n\nBut in the output, just the actions.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nAlso, in turn 19, from (2,3) to (2,2), is it safe? Yes.\n\nAnd no instant reverse: after turn 18 move R, direction right, then turn 19 move D down, not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen turn 20 move D down again, from (2,2) to (2,1), direction down.\n\nThen turn 21 move R right, from (2,1) to (3,1), not opposite to down, so ok.\n\nThen turn 22 move U up, from (3,1) to (3,2), not opposite to right, so ok.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (2,1) with a value of +1, as it has a longer life span (8 turns) and can be safely reached. The food at (6,3) is avoided due to the high risk of collision and death after eating it, as the only exit (to (6,2)) leads to a dead end. The path to (2,1) involves moving right to (2,3) on turn 18 (the only safe move), then down to (2,2) on turn 19, and down to (2,1) to eat the food on turn 20. After eating, the snake moves right to (3,1) on turn 21 to avoid the dead end at (1,1), and then up to (3,2) on turn 22 for exploration and survival. This sequence eats one positive food (+1 score) and avoids all immediate risks, with a safe path for future turns.\n\n### Key Reasoning:\n- **Turn 18 (Current State)**: From (1,3), only right to (2,3) is possible (up: body collision, down: obstacle, left: wall).\n- **Turn 19**: From (2,3), move down to (2,2) (up: obstacle, left: body collision, right: possible but defers eating (2,1)).\n- **Turn 20**: From (2,2), move down to (2,1) to eat positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 7). Eating (2,1) is safe as the tail is not adjacent.\n- **Turn 21**: From (2,1), move right to (3,1) to avoid dead end (up: body collision, down: wall, left: dead end).\n- **Turn 22**: From (3,1), move up to (3,2) for exploration (down: wall, left: body collision, right: possible but up chosen for safety).\n- **5+ Turns Ahead Consideration**: \n  - (6,3) is not pursued due to short life span (disappears after turn 22) and lethal exit risk.\n  - After turn 22, the snake can explore safely (e.g., move to (3,3) or (4,2)) to find new food or avoid starvation.\n  - Survival is prioritized; eating (2,1) early ensures score gain with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 19: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 20: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 21: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 22: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 19, and I'm the snake. My goal is to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nLet me list out the key information:\n\n- **Walls**: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). I need to avoid these cells.\n\n- **Snake Positions**: Head is at (2,3), and the body segments are: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is Right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (2,3) from previous position.\n\nSince the head is at (2,3) and direction is R, that means it came from the left, so previous head was at (1,3) or something? Snake positions are given as a list: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. So head is (2,3), next is (1,3), which is left of head, but direction is R? That might be inconsistent.\n\nLet's think: if head is at (2,3) and direction is R, that means it moved right to get to (2,3). So before that, head was at (1,3), and it moved right to (2,3). But in the positions, (1,3) is the second segment, which is correct; after head moves to (2,3), the segment that was at (1,3) is still there, but the tail will move later.\n\nPositions are current: head at (2,3), then body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), tail at (2,6). Since head moved right to (2,3), the previous head position was (1,3), which is now the neck.\n\nNow, head direction is R, so for the next move, I can choose to go Up, Down, or Right, but not Left because that would be reverse, and reverse is not allowed if it's opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move Left immediately.\n\nMovement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction. So from current head direction R, possible moves are U, D, R. Not L.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (6,3) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 and life span given.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So for (6,3), life span 4 at turn 19, so it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone on turn t + N.\n\nThe food is present for N turns starting from when it was spawned. But here, life span is given at current turn, so for (6,3), life span 4 at turn 19, so it will disappear after turn 19 + 4 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nTypically in such games, if life span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear after N more turns, so at the end of turn t + N, it's gone. So for (6,3), at turn 19, life span 4, so it will be there until turn 22 (since turn 19: life span 4, turn 20: 3, turn 21: 2, turn 22: 1, then after turn 22, it disappears? Or during turn 22 it has life span 1, and after that it's gone.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, then after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n\nBut when it says \"disappears after N turns\", it might be ambiguous.\n\nLet's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means: at the beginning of turn t, life span is L. After the turn is processed, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food during a turn, it is eaten before the decrease.\n\nTo simplify, for planning, if life span is L at turn t, it will be available for L more turns, including turn t. So it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1 or at start of turn t+L.\n\nBut since we act on each turn, we can consider that food with life span L at turn t can be eaten if we reach it by turn t + L - 1.\n\nFor example, (6,3) at turn 19, life span 4, so it can be eaten until turn 22 (since turn 19+3=22? Let's index turns.\n\nTurn 19: life span 4, so after turn 19, it decreases to 3, so at turn 20, life span 3. Similarly, after turn 20, to 2, turn 21:2, after turn 21 to 1, turn 22:1, after turn 22 to 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 19,20,21,22. On turn 22, if not eaten, after turn it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 7 at turn 19, so available until turn 25.\n\n(6,6) life span 10, available until turn 28.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nList them:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (3,5)\n\nSnake positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6). So tail is at (2,6).\n\nCurrent head direction: R (right).\n\nPossible moves from (2,3): U, D, R. Not L because reverse not allowed.\n\nBut I need to see where I can move without colliding.\n\nFirst, check adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,4) - but (2,4) is an internal obstacle? No, (2,4) is listed as an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4)? Let's see: internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5). Yes, (2,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move up to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is in the obstacles, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, Down: (2,2) - is this free? Not listed as wall or obstacle. Walls are borders and internal points. Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,2) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: not (2,2), so should be free, but snake body might be there? Snake positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6). No (2,2), so (2,2) is empty.\n\nLeft: (1,3) - but (1,3) is occupied by the snake body, the second segment. But can I move there? Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, if I move left to (1,3), which is currently occupied by the second segment. But after I move, the snake moves: head to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail moves away.\n\nSo if head moves to (1,3), which is now the position of the second segment, but since the second segment will move to where the head was or something.\n\nSequence: before move, positions: head (2,3), segment2 (1,3), segment3 (1,4), etc., tail (2,6).\n\nIf head moves left to (1,3), then after move: new head at (1,3), then segment2 moves to where head was? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to the new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves from (2,3) to (1,3), then the segment that was at (1,3) moves to the next position, but since head is moving to (1,3), which was occupied, but in the new state, the head is at (1,3), and the segment that was at (1,3) must move to where the head was, but (2,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nGenerally, when moving, the head goes to the new cell. If that cell was occupied by the tail, it's ok because tail moves away. If occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, then collision.\n\nSpecifically, in this case, (1,3) is occupied by the second segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (2,6). So if head moves to (1,3), which is currently occupied by a body segment, it would collide with body.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment\", implying that for other body segments, you cannot.\n\nAnd \"body collision (head touches any body segment)\" except the tail case.\n\nSo here, (1,3) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (1,3) would cause collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move left to (1,3).\n\nNow, Right: to (3,3) - is (3,3) free? Not a wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: no (3,3), so should be free.\n\nDown: to (2,2) - not wall, not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\nUp: to (2,4) - but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,3) with direction R: U, D, R.\n\nBut U to (2,4) is wall, so impossible.\n\nD to (2,2) possible.\n\nR to (3,3) possible.\n\nL not possible, as above.\n\nSo only two choices: Down to (2,2) or Right to (3,3).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (6,3) at (6,3), value 1, life span 4 (available turns 19-22)\n\n- (2,1) at (2,1), value 1, life span 7 (available 19-25)\n\n- (6,6) at (6,6), value 1, life span 10 (available 19-28)\n\nAll positive.\n\nNow, snake is at (2,3), with body.\n\nI should consider paths to food.\n\nFirst, let's find a safe path.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this state, tail is at (2,6), and there is no food on tail, so not an issue now.\n\nNow, possible actions turn 19: D or R.\n\nCase 1: Move Down to (2,2)\n\nThen new position: head at (2,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nBody: after move, segments: head (2,2), then the previous head (2,3) becomes neck, so positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] and tail (2,6) moves to where (2,5) was? Let's trace.\n\nBefore move: positions: index 0:head (2,3), 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5:tail (2,6)\n\nAfter head moves down to (2,2):\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nThen segment 1 (was at (1,3)) moves to previous head position (2,3)\n\nSegment 2 (was at (1,4)) moves to where segment 1 was, (1,3)\n\nSegment 3 (was at (1,5)) moves to where segment 2 was, (1,4)\n\nSegment 4 (was at (2,5)) moves to where segment 3 was, (1,5)\n\nTail segment 5 (was at (2,6)) moves to where segment 4 was, (2,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail is at (2,5)\n\nNow, from here, possible moves from (2,2) with direction D (down).\n\nCan move D, L, R? Current direction D, so cannot move U (up).\n\nPossible: D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\nNow, (2,1) has food! Positive food at (2,1), life span 7.\n\nIf I move down to (2,1), I eat the food.\n\nBut is it safe? (2,1) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nBut check if adjacent to tail: current tail is at (2,5), head at (2,2), not adjacent. After eating, head to (2,1), and new segment added, so tail becomes (2,5), but positions: after move to (2,1), head at (2,1), then since food eaten, length increases, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n\nSequence: when head moves to food cell, it eats, so snake grows: head moves to new cell, body segments move as usual, but tail stays, and a new segment is added where tail was, so tail extends.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions as above, head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), tail (2,5)\n\nIf head moves down to (2,1), which has food, so eat: head to (2,1), then the body: segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Let's think.\n\nGeneral: when head moves to a cell without food, all segments move, tail vacates.\n\nWhen head moves to food, head moves to food, body segments move to previous positions, but tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the position where tail was, so snake grows by one.\n\nSo here: head moves to (2,1) (food), so new head (2,1)\n\nThen, the segment that was at position 1: (2,3) moves to where head was, (2,2)\n\nSegment that was at 2: (1,3) moves to where segment 1 was, (2,3)\n\nSegment that was at 3: (1,4) moves to where segment 2 was, (1,3)\n\nSegment that was at 4: (1,5) moves to where segment 3 was, (1,4)\n\nSegment that was at 5 (tail): does not move, and a new segment is added at (2,5), so now tail is at (2,5), and the previous segment 4 moves to (1,5), but (1,5) is now occupied by the moved segment.\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), then body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and new tail at (2,5) — but (2,5) was where the tail was, but in the list, segment that was tail is now the second last, and new tail at same position? I think I'm confusing.\n\nBetter to think indices.\n\nBefore move: positions: let's list with indices for clarity.\n\nTurn after moving to (2,2): positions P0: (2,2) head, P1: (2,3), P2: (1,3), P3: (1,4), P4: (1,5), P5: (2,5) tail\n\nNow, move head to (2,1), which has food.\n\nAfter move: new head at (2,1)\n\nThen, for body: P1 moves to P0's old position, which is (2,2)\n\nP2 moves to P1's old position (2,3)\n\nP3 moves to P2's old position (1,3)\n\nP4 moves to P3's old position (1,4)\n\nP5 (tail) moves to P4's old position (1,5)\n\nBut since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position before move, which was (2,5), so new segment at (2,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (2,1), then P1: (2,2), P2: (2,3), P3: (1,3), P4: (1,4), P5: (1,5), and new segment P6: (2,5)\n\nSo tail is at (1,5) and (2,5)? No, P5 is at (1,5), P6 at (2,5), so tail is P6 at (2,5).\n\nList: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\nSo length 7 now.\n\nAnd no collision, since (2,1) was free.\n\nNow, back to turn 19 choice.\n\nIf I move down to (2,2) on turn 19, then on turn 20 I can move to (2,1) and eat food immediately.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. Is this good? I get +1 score, but I should see what happens after.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nNow, from (2,1), possible moves: current direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot.\n\nL to (1,1), R to (3,1)\n\n(1,1) : is it free? Not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(3,1) similarly, not obstacle.\n\nBut (1,1) might be occupied? Snake positions: after eating, positions include (1,4), (1,5), etc., not (1,1).\n\nSo both L and R possible.\n\nBut if I move L to (1,1), or R to (3,1).\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to other food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I have another choice at turn 19.\n\nAlternative: at turn 19, move Right to (3,3)\n\nThen new head at (3,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nBody: after move, P0 old (2,3) head, P1 (1,3), P2 (1,4), P3 (1,5), P4 (2,5), P5 (2,6)\n\nHead to (3,3), so new head (3,3)\n\nP1 moves to P0 old (2,3)\n\nP2 moves to P1 old (1,3)\n\nP3 moves to P2 old (1,4)\n\nP4 moves to P3 old (1,5)\n\nP5 moves to P4 old (2,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail at (2,5)\n\nNow, from (3,3), direction R, possible moves: U, D, R. Not L.\n\nU to (3,4), D to (3,2), R to (4,3)\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(3,4): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,5) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so free. Snake positions: no (3,4), so free.\n\n(3,2): similarly, free? Obstacles: (5,2) is there, but (3,2) not, so free.\n\n(4,3): free? Not wall, not obstacle.\n\nBut (4,3) might be considered later.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), which is on the same row y=3, x=6.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go right towards (6,3).\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), etc., but on row 3, from x=3 to x=6, cells: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\n(4,3) should be free, (5,3): is there obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), but (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(6,3) is the food, but (6,3) might be under something? No, it's a food position.\n\nBut (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, which is not a wall, but x=6 is border? Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is within bounds, since x=7 is wall, so cells x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable, except obstacles.\n\nx=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok.\n\nNow, from (3,3) to (6,3), I can go right: to (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3).\n\n(5,3) is free, as above.\n\nBut life span of (6,3) is 4, so I can reach it in a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut let's compare the two choices.\n\nFirst option: move down to (2,2) on turn 19, then to (2,1) on turn 20 to eat food, score +1, length 7.\n\nThen from (2,1), I need to move, say to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nIf to (1,1), then from there, I can go up or right, but up to (1,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,2), which is a wall, so from (1,1), I cannot go up to (1,2) because it's wall.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,0) is y=0 wall, left to (0,1) x=0 wall, so only right to (2,1), but (2,1) is now occupied by the snake? After eating, head at (2,1), if I move to (1,1), then from (2,1) I can move to (1,1) if free.\n\nAt turn 20, after eating at (2,1), positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) should be free.\n\nMove to (1,1): then new head (1,1), direction L (since left from (2,1)? Direction: from (2,1) moving to (1,1) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen body moves accordingly.\n\nBut from (1,1), as I said, only possible move is right to (2,1), but (2,1) is now occupied by the body? After moving to (1,1), positions: head (1,1), then P1 moves to (2,1), which was head position, but (2,1) is now occupied by the segment, and so on.\n\nSpecifically, before move from (2,1): positions H(2,1), P1(2,2), P2(2,3), P3(1,3), P4(1,4), P5(1,5), P6(2,5)  // since length 7 after eating\n\nIf move left to (1,1): head to (1,1), then P1 moves to H old (2,1), P2 moves to P1 old (2,2), P3 moves to P2 old (2,3), P4 moves to P3 old (1,3), P5 moves to P4 old (1,4), P6 moves to P5 old (1,5), and tail P6 was at (2,5), moves to (1,5)? Indices.\n\nAfter eating at turn 20, positions: let's list: P0: (2,1), P1: (2,2), P2: (2,3), P3: (1,3), P4: (1,4), P5: (1,5), P6: (2,5)\n\nMove to (1,1): new head (1,1)\n\nThen P1 moves to P0 old (2,1)\n\nP2 moves to P1 old (2,2)\n\nP3 moves to P2 old (2,3)\n\nP4 moves to P3 old (1,3)\n\nP5 moves to P4 old (1,4)\n\nP6 moves to P5 old (1,5)\n\nSo new positions: H(1,1), P1(2,1), P2(2,2), P3(2,3), P4(1,3), P5(1,4), P6(1,5)\n\nTail at (1,5)\n\nFrom (1,1), direction L, possible moves: since direction L, cannot move R.\n\nPossible U, D, L.\n\nU to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,0): y=0 wall, cannot.\n\nL to (0,1): x=0 wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (1,1), no possible moves! Dead end.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (1,1), I die immediately on the next turn because no valid moves.\n\nTherefore, at turn 20, after eating at (2,1), I must not move left to (1,1); I must move right to (3,1).\n\nSo from (2,1), move right to (3,1).\n\nThen new head (3,1), direction R.\n\nBody: P1 moves to (2,1), P2 to (2,2), P3 to (2,3), P4 to (1,3), P5 to (1,4), P6 to (1,5)\n\nSo positions: H(3,1), P1(2,1), P2(2,2), P3(2,3), P4(1,3), P5(1,4), P6(1,5)\n\nTail at (1,5)\n\nFrom (3,1), direction R, possible moves: U, D, R. Not L.\n\nU to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, cannot. R to (4,1)\n\n(3,2): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2) but (3,2) not, so free. Snake? Positions no (3,2), so free.\n\n(4,1): similarly, free? Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not, so free.\n\nSo can go U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\nNow, I can continue, but let's see the other choice first.\n\nBack to turn 19, if I move right to (3,3) instead.\n\nAt turn 19, move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 20, from (3,3), I can move towards (6,3).\n\nFor example, move R to (4,3)\n\nThen head to (4,3), direction R.\n\nBody moves: P1 to (3,3), P2 to (2,3), P3 to (1,3), P4 to (1,4), P5 to (1,5), P6 to (2,5)  // tail was at (2,5) before, but after move, positions change.\n\nAfter turn 19 move to (3,3): positions H(3,3), P1(2,3), P2(1,3), P3(1,4), P4(1,5), P5(2,5)\n\nOn turn 20, move R to (4,3): head to (4,3)\n\nP1 moves to H old (3,3)\n\nP2 moves to P1 old (2,3)\n\nP3 moves to P2 old (1,3)\n\nP4 moves to P3 old (1,4)\n\nP5 moves to P4 old (1,5)\n\nSo new positions: H(4,3), P1(3,3), P2(2,3), P3(1,3), P4(1,4), P5(1,5)\n\nTail at (1,5)\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can move to (5,3) or other.\n\n(5,3) should be free, as no obstacle.\n\nThen to (6,3) to eat food on turn 22? Let's count turns.\n\nTurn 19: at (3,3)\n\nTurn 20: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22: to (6,3) eat food.\n\nLife span of (6,3) is 4 at turn 19, so at turn 22: turn 19 life 4, turn 20 life 3, turn 21 life 2, turn 22 life 1, so on turn 22 it can be eaten, yes.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, length 7.\n\nBut now, at (6,3), after eating, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nBut x=6, which is near border x=7 wall.\n\nFrom (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,2), R to (7,3) x=7 wall, cannot. L to (5,3)\n\nSo only possible moves: D to (6,2) or L to (5,3)\n\n(6,2): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,1), (6,4), but (6,2) not listed, so should be free. Snake? Not occupied yet.\n\n(5,3) is where I came from, but after body move, it might be occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3) on turn 22.\n\nBefore move: positions H(5,3) on turn 21? Let's sequence.\n\nOn turn 21: head at (5,3), positions: assume from earlier.\n\nAfter turn 21 move to (5,3): head (5,3), P1 (4,3), P2 (3,3), P3 (2,3), P4 (1,3), P5 (1,4)? Earlier positions before move to (5,3).\n\nOn turn 20: after move to (4,3), positions H(4,3), P1(3,3), P2(2,3), P3(1,3), P4(1,4), P5(1,5)\n\nTurn 21: move to (5,3), head to (5,3)\n\nP1 moves to H old (4,3)\n\nP2 moves to P1 old (3,3)\n\nP3 moves to P2 old (2,3)\n\nP4 moves to P3 old (1,3)\n\nP5 moves to P4 old (1,4)\n\nSo positions: H(5,3), P1(4,3), P2(3,3), P3(2,3), P4(1,3), P5(1,4)\n\nTail at (1,4)\n\nNow turn 22: move to (6,3) which has food, eat.\n\nHead to (6,3)\n\nThen body: P1 moves to H old (5,3)\n\nP2 moves to P1 old (4,3)\n\nP3 moves to P2 old (3,3)\n\nP4 moves to P3 old (2,3)\n\nP5 moves to P4 old (1,3)\n\nAnd new segment added at previous tail position (1,4), so P6: (1,4)\n\nNew positions: H(6,3), P1(5,3), P2(4,3), P3(3,3), P4(2,3), P5(1,3), P6(1,4)\n\nTail at (1,4)\n\nNow from (6,3), direction R, but can only move L to (5,3) or D to (6,2)\n\n(5,3) is occupied by P1, which is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (5,3) would cause collision, since P1 is there and it's not moving away immediately.\n\nIf I move to (5,3), head to (5,3), but P1 is at (5,3) now, and it's not the tail, so collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot move left to (5,3).\n\nOnly possible move is down to (6,2).\n\nMove to (6,2): head to (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen body moves: P1 to (6,3), P2 to (5,3), etc., and tail moves to P5 old (1,3), and no new segment since no food.\n\nBut (6,2) is free, so ok.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut I have another food at (6,6) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is still available, life span 7, until turn 25.\n\nBut let's compare the two scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: move down on turn 19 to (2,2), then turn 20 to (2,1) eat food, score +1.\n\nThen must move right to (3,1) on turn 20? Turn 20 I moved to (2,1) and ate, so on turn 21, from (2,1) I move to (3,1).\n\nAfter turn 20: head at (2,1) after eating, positions as before: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nOn turn 21, move right to (3,1): head to (3,1), direction R.\n\nThen P1 moves to (2,1), P2 to (2,2), P3 to (2,3), P4 to (1,3), P5 to (1,4), P6 to (1,5)\n\nPositions: H(3,1), P1(2,1), P2(2,2), P3(2,3), P4(1,3), P5(1,4), P6(1,5)\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go to (4,1) or (3,2), etc.\n\n(6,3) food might expire soon, but I can go to (6,6) which has longer life.\n\nBut in the second scenario, by going right on turn 19, I can reach (6,3) by turn 22 and eat, score +1, similar.\n\nBut in first scenario, I eat (2,1) earlier, on turn 20, and in second, I eat (6,3) on turn 22.\n\nBut both give +1.\n\nHowever, in the first scenario, after eating (2,1), I am at (2,1) and must go to (3,1), which is near the bottom, and the snake body is above, so I might have space issues.\n\nIn second scenario, after eating (6,3), I am at (6,3) and go to (6,2), then I can go down or left.\n\nBut there is food at (6,6) which I might go for.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), value 1, life span 10, available until turn 28.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go down to (6,1), but (6,1) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n(6,1) is obstacle, so from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied by body? After moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), then P1 moves to (6,3), P2 to (5,3), etc., so (6,3) is occupied by P1, so I cannot move up to (6,3).\n\nL to (5,2), but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nD to (6,1) wall, cannot.\n\nR to (7,2) x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nFrom (6,2), only possible moves were L or D or U, but U to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,2) wall, D to (6,1) wall, so no valid moves! Dead end.\n\nIn second scenario, after eating at (6,3) and moving to (6,2) on turn 23? Let's clarify turns.\n\nTurn 22: move to (6,3) eat, so after that, head at (6,3), positions as above.\n\nThen on turn 23, from (6,3), I can only move down to (6,2), as we said.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2): head to (6,2)\n\nP1 moves to H old (6,3)\n\nP2 moves to P1 old (5,3)\n\nP3 to P2 old (4,3)\n\nP4 to P3 old (3,3)\n\nP5 to P4 old (2,3)\n\nP6 to P5 old (1,3)\n\nAnd no new segment.\n\nPositions: H(6,2), P1(6,3), P2(5,3), P3(4,3), P4(3,3), P5(2,3), P6(1,3)\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves: current direction D (down).\n\nCannot move U (up) because opposite? Direction is D, so cannot move U? Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so possible moves: L, R, D.\n\nBut D to (6,1): (6,1) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nR to (7,2): x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nL to (5,2): (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nU to (6,3): but (6,3) is occupied by P1, and it's a body segment, not tail, so moving there causes collision.\n\nTherefore, no possible moves from (6,2). Snake dies.\n\nSo in the second scenario, if I go to eat (6,3), I end up trapped at (6,2) with no escape.\n\nTherefore, going for (6,3) is risky and leads to death soon after.\n\nIn the first scenario, after eating (2,1) and moving to (3,1), I have options.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move up to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n\n(3,2) is free, as we said.\n\n(4,1) is free.\n\nSuppose I move up to (3,2) on turn 21.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to other places.\n\nFor example, there is food at (6,6) and (2,1) is eaten, but (2,1) was eaten, so only (6,6) left.\n\n(2,1) eaten on turn 20, so gone.\n\nFood at (6,6) available.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can head towards (6,6).\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nPath: from (3,2) to (6,6).\n\nPossible moves: right to (4,2), but (4,2) might be free? Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) not, so free.\n\nThen to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo cannot go directly right on row 2.\n\nFrom (3,2), move up to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) on turn 21, positions: from before, at turn 21 after moving to (3,1): H(3,1), P1(2,1), P2(2,2), P3(2,3), P4(1,3), P5(1,4), P6(1,5)\n\nMove to (3,2): head to (3,2), direction U (up? from (3,1) to (3,2) is up, so direction U.\n\nThen P1 moves to (3,1), P2 to (2,1), P3 to (2,2), P4 to (2,3), P5 to (1,3), P6 to (1,4)\n\nPositions: H(3,2), P1(3,1), P2(2,1), P3(2,2), P4(2,3), P5(1,3), P6(1,4)\n\nFrom (3,2), direction U, possible moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n\nU to (3,3), which should be free now? Snake not there, not obstacle.\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nR to (4,2), free.\n\nL to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by P3, body segment, not tail, so cannot move there.\n\nSo can go U to (3,3) or R to (4,2).\n\nIf U to (3,3), then from there, I can go to (4,3), etc., towards (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at bottom right.\n\nBut to reach (6,6), I need to go down and right.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (4,3), (5,3), then to (5,4) or something, but (5,4) might be free, then to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n(6,4) is internal obstacle.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go down to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, or up to (5,4), or right to (6,3) but (6,3) might be gone or occupied.\n\n(6,3) food expired after turn 22, so later it's empty if not eaten.\n\nBut in this path, it's turn 21 or later.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (6,6) via other paths.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) or something.\n\nBut it might be messy.\n\nAnother food is (2,1), but it's eaten in first scenario.\n\nIn the first choice, if I go down on turn 19, I eat (2,1) on turn 20, but then I am forced to go to (3,1), and from there I have to navigate carefully to avoid dead ends.\n\nIn the second choice, going right on turn 19 to (3,3), I can go to eat (6,3) but it leads to death.\n\nBut I don't have to eat (6,3); I can go for other food.\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 19, I can move down to (3,2) or up to (3,4), etc.\n\nFor example, move down to (3,2) on turn 20.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is below the current position.\n\nIf I go right to (3,3) on turn 19, then to reach (2,1), I need to go down and left.\n\nBut from (3,3), move down to (3,2) on turn 20.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move down to (3,1) or left to (2,2), etc.\n\n(3,1) is free, as before.\n\nMove to (3,1) on turn 21, then to (2,1) on turn 22 to eat, but (2,1) life span 7, available.\n\nOn turn 22, life span 7 at turn 19, turn 22 is 19+3, life span decreases to 7-3=4? At turn 19 life span 7, turn 20:6, turn 21:5, turn 22:4, so yes available.\n\nBut in this case, I eat on turn 22 instead of turn 20, so I get the point later, but not worse.\n\nBut I need to see the board state.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating immediate food but planning for longer survival and multiple food.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (6,6) has long life span, so I can go for that later.\n\nBut the snake is currently in the left area.\n\nLet's list all possible cells and obstacles.\n\nGrid: rows y=0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6.\n\nColumns x=0 to 7, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6.\n\nPlayable cells: (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo obstacles at: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nFree cells: all other from (1,1) to (6,6) except these.\n\nSnake occupies: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nSo (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6) occupied.\n\nFood at: (6,3), (2,1), (6,6)\n\n(2,1) is free, not occupied by snake.\n\nNow, at turn 19, if I move down to (2,2), I can eat (2,1) next turn.\n\nIf I move right to (3,3), I can go to (6,3) but it's dangerous.\n\nI can go for (6,6) from (3,3).\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move up to (3,4) on turn 20.\n\n(3,4) free, as we said.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move right to (4,4), or up to (3,5), but (3,5) is obstacle, cannot, so only right or down, but direction from (3,3) to (3,4) is U, so at (3,4) direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,5) obstacle, cannot.\n\nL to (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nR to (4,4) free.\n\nSo must move right to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4), to (5,4) or other.\n\n(5,4) free? Not obstacle, yes.\n\nThen to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3) or up to (5,5), etc.\n\nThen to reach (6,6), I need to go to (5,5), (6,5), then (6,6).\n\n(6,5) free? Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(6,6) is food.\n\nBut (5,6) is obstacle, so from (5,5) to (6,5) is possible, then to (6,6).\n\nLife span of (6,6) is 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nSimilarly, from the first choice, after eating (2,1), I can also go to (6,6).\n\nBut in the first choice, by eating (2,1) early, I have a longer snake, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nLength 7 vs 6.\n\nBut in open space, it might be ok.\n\nAnother risk: the tail reward danger, but no food on tail now.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid the corner where (6,3) is, since it's risky.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is near the bottom left, but after eating, I can move away.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead from turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: possible actions D or R.\n\nIf D to (2,2): then turn 20, move to (2,1) eat food. Score +1, length 7.\n\nThen turn 20: from (2,1), must move R to (3,1) to avoid dead end. (as moving L to (1,1) is dead, so only R to (3,1))\n\nTurn 21: from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\nSuppose move U to (3,2) for more space.\n\nTurn 22: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3) or R to (4,2).\n\nIf move U to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut no immediate food, so I need to go to (6,6) eventually.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I move R to (4,2), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) free, (4,3) free.\n\nThen to (5,3), (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) obstacle, so from (5,3) I can go to (5,4), then to (6,4) obstacle, cannot, so to (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,6).\n\nPossible.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 19 I move R to (3,3): turn 19 to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 20, from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) to go towards (2,1) or U to (3,4) to go towards (6,6).\n\nIf I move D to (3,2) on turn 20.\n\nThen turn 21, from (3,2), can move D to (3,1) or L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\n(2,2) is free? At turn 20, after moving to (3,2), positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 19 to (3,3): positions H(3,3), P1(2,3), P2(1,3), P3(1,4), P4(1,5), P5(2,5)\n\nTurn 20 move D to (3,2): head to (3,2), direction D.\n\nP1 moves to (3,3), P2 to (2,3), P3 to (1,3), P4 to (1,4), P5 to (1,5)\n\nPositions: H(3,2), P1(3,3), P2(2,3), P3(1,3), P4(1,4), P5(1,5)\n\nFrom (3,2), direction D, can move D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\nAll free, I think.\n\nIf I move to (3,1) on turn 21, then to (2,1) on turn 22 to eat.\n\nBut (2,1) is still there.\n\nAfter eating, similar to before.\n\nBut I avoid the early death trap of (6,3).\n\nIf I go for (6,6) directly.\n\nBut in both cases, I can survive and eat food.\n\nBut in the first choice, I eat (2,1) on turn 20, whereas in the second, I might eat it later or eat other.\n\nBut (6,3) is risky, so better not to go there.\n\nMoreover, (6,6) is safer to eat.\n\nBut let's see the map: the area near (6,6) has obstacles (5,6) and (6,4), but (6,6) itself is free.\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,7) wall, L to (5,6) obstacle, R to (7,6) wall, so only U to (6,5).\n\nSo after eating, I must move up to (6,5), then from there, I can go left or up, etc.\n\nBut it might be ok.\n\nTo maximize score, since all food is +1, eating any is good, but I should eat the one that doesn't lead to trap.\n\n(2,1) is closer and safer to eat now.\n\nAlso, life span of (6,3) is short, only 4 turns, so if I don't go for it, it disappears, but it's risky, so better to skip it.\n\n(6,6) has long life, so I can go later.\n\nTherefore, at turn 19, moving down to (2,2) to eat (2,1) next turn seems good.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (6,6) afterward.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 19: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: move D to (2,1) eat food\n\nTurn 21: from (2,1), move R to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 22: from (3,1), move U to (3,2) for example, to have more space.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n\nThe answer format should be for turns 19,20,21,22,23,... but since I don't know the state, I need to specify actions based on current state, but the state changes, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I need to provide a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nBut since the grid has obstacles and food, I can plan a path.\n\nTo be safe, from turn 19:\n\n- Turn 19: D (down to (2,2))\n\n- Turn 20: D (down to (2,1) eat food)\n\n- Turn 21: R (right to (3,1))\n\n- Turn 22: U (up to (3,2))\n\n- Turn 23: from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2) or U to (3,3)\n\nSay move R to (4,2) to head right.\n\nThen turn 24: to (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut I need to ensure no dead end.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, I can provide up to turn 23 or more.\n\nBut let's see the food.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), I can go there via (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(5,3) free, (5,4) free, (5,5) free? Not obstacle, (6,5) free, (6,6) food.\n\n(5,6) obstacle, but not on path.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,3), then (5,3), then (5,4), then (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,6).\n\nAll cells should be free at that time.\n\nFor example, on turn 23 at (4,2), then turn 24 to (4,3), turn 25 to (5,3), turn 26 to (5,4), turn 27 to (5,5), turn 28 to (6,5), turn 29 to (6,6) eat.\n\nLife span of (6,6) is 10 at turn 19, so at turn 29: 19+10=29, life span decreases, at turn 29, if not eaten, life span 10-10=0? Turn 19:10, turn 20:9, ..., turn 28:1, turn 29:0, disappears before turn 29? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 19, life span L=10\n\nAfter turn 19, L=9 for turn 20\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k, L decreases.\n\nAt turn t, life span L_t.\n\nIf L_t >0, food present.\n\nAt turn 19, L=10, so present turns 19 to 28 (since at turn 28, L=1, after turn 28, L=0, gone).\n\nSo can be eaten on turns 19 to 28.\n\nTurn 29 is too late.\n\nSo to eat on turn 28 or before.\n\nIn my plan, if I go to (6,6) on turn 29, it's gone.\n\nTurn 28: if I am at (6,5), I can move to (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nFrom above, turn 27 at (5,5), turn 28 to (6,5)? (6,5) is not food, then turn 29 to (6,6) but food gone.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 27, I can move to (6,5) on turn 28, but (6,5) is not food, then on turn 29 to (6,6) but food expired.\n\nBut on turn 28, from (5,5), I can move directly to (6,6)? (5,5) to (6,6) is not adjacent, diagonal, not allowed, only orthogonal.\n\nSo must go to (6,5) or (5,6), but (5,6) obstacle, so only to (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) can be eaten on turn 29, but life span: at turn 28, L=1, so if I move to (6,6) on turn 28, I can eat it.\n\nTurn 28: move to (6,6), eat if present.\n\nAt turn 28, L=1, so yes.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 27 at (5,5), turn 28 to (6,5)? No, from (5,5) to (6,6) not direct.\n\nFrom (5,5), on turn 27, I can move to (6,5) or (5,4) or (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so to (6,5) or (5,4).\n\nTo go to (6,6), move to (6,5) on turn 27? Let's timeline.\n\nAssume start from turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: move D to (2,2)\n\nAfter: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail at (2,5)\n\nTurn 20: move D to (2,1) eat food\n\nAfter: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) new tail? After eating, positions: head (2,1), P1 (2,2), P2 (2,3), P3 (1,3), P4 (1,4), P5 (1,5), P6 (2,5)\n\nTurn 21: move R to (3,1)\n\nAfter: head (3,1), P1 (2,1), P2 (2,2), P3 (2,3), P4 (1,3), P5 (1,4), P6 (1,5)\n\nTurn 22: move U to (3,2)\n\nAfter: head (3,2), P1 (3,1), P2 (2,1), P3 (2,2), P4 (2,3), P5 (1,3), P6 (1,4)\n\nTurn 23: move R to (4,2)  // for example\n\nAfter: head (4,2), P1 (3,2), P2 (3,1), P3 (2,1), P4 (2,2), P5 (2,3), P6 (1,3)\n\nTurn 24: move U to (4,3)  // or to (4,3) to go up\n\nAfter: head (4,3), P1 (4,2), P2 (3,2), P3 (3,1), P4 (2,1), P5 (2,2), P6 (2,3)\n\nTurn 25: move R to (5,3)\n\nAfter: head (5,3), P1 (4,3), P2 (4,2), P3 (3,2), P4 (3,1), P5 (2,1), P6 (2,2)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (5,4)  // to go towards (5,5)\n\nAfter: head (5,4), P1 (5,3), P2 (4,3), P3 (4,2), P4 (3,2), P5 (3,1), P6 (2,1)\n\nTurn 27: move U to (5,5)\n\nAfter: head (5,5), P1 (5,4), P2 (5,3), P3 (4,3), P4 (4,2), P5 (3,2), P6 (3,1)\n\nTurn 28: move R to (6,5)  // to approach (6,6)\n\n(6,5) is free? Yes.\n\nAfter: head (6,5), P1 (5,5), P2 (5,4), P3 (5,3), P4 (4,3), P5 (4,2), P6 (3,2)\n\nBut (6,6) is food, I need to go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,5), on turn 29, move to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut on turn 29, food at (6,6) life span: at turn 19 L=10, turn 20 L=9, ..., turn 28 L=1, after turn 28, L=0, gone. So on turn 29, it is not there.\n\nTherefore, I must reach (6,6) by turn 28.\n\nOn turn 28, I am at (5,5), I can move directly to (6,6)? Not adjacent.\n\nMove to (6,5) on turn 28, but (6,5) is not food, then on turn 29 to (6,6) but gone.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 27, I can move to (6,5) on turn 28, but not food.\n\nThen no way to eat on turn 28.\n\nUnless I reach (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nBut from turn 27 position, at (5,5), I can only move to adjacent cells, not directly to (6,6).\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,6) in this sequence because I arrive too late.\n\nBut life span until turn 28, so I need to be at (6,6) on or before turn 28.\n\nFor example, on turn 28, move to (6,6) from (5,6) or (6,5), but (5,6) is obstacle, so only from (6,5).\n\nSo if I am at (6,5) on turn 27, then turn 28 move to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 27 I am at (5,5), not (6,5).\n\nI need to adjust the path to be faster.\n\nFor example, from turn 24 at (4,3), instead of to (5,4), go directly to (5,3) then to (6,3) but (6,3) might be gone or not, but life span short.\n\n(6,3) available until turn 22, so on turn 24 gone.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTo (6,6) faster.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 24, move R to (5,3) on turn 25.\n\nThen from (5,3), on turn 26, move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27, move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28, move R to (6,5)  // but not to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 29 to (6,6) too late.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 26, move R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr from (5,4) move U to (5,5) on turn 26, then turn 27 to (6,5), turn 28 to (6,6).\n\nBut turn 26 at (5,4), turn 27 to (5,5) or to (6,4) cannot, so to (5,5), then turn 28 to (6,5), turn 29 to (6,6) late.\n\nCan I reach (6,6) by turn 28?\n\nFor example, if on turn 24 at (4,3), move to (4,4) instead, but not in path.\n\nOr from earlier.\n\nPerhaps from turn 22 at (3,2), instead of to (4,2), go to (3,3) or directly right.\n\nBut (3,3) might be occupied.\n\nIn turn 22 position, after move to (3,2): H(3,2), P1(3,1), P2(2,1), P3(2,2), P4(2,3), P5(1,3), P6(1,4)\n\nFrom (3,2), move R to (4,2) on turn 23.\n\nThen turn 24, from (4,2) move to (4,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so to (4,3).\n\nSame as before.\n\nMove to (5,3) directly from (4,2)? Not adjacent.\n\nSo minimum turns to (6,6) from (3,2) on turn 22: to (4,2) t23, (4,3) t24, (5,3) t25, (5,4) t26, (5,5) t27, (6,5) t28, (6,6) t29 — too late.\n\nFrom (5,4) on t26, I can move to (6,4) but obstacle, no.\n\nOr to (5,5) t26, then (6,5) t27, (6,6) t28 eat on t28.\n\nt28 is ok.\n\nFrom turn 22 at (3,2):\n\nTurn 23: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 26: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: to (6,5)? (6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is playable.\n\nThen on turn 28, from (6,5) to (6,6) but (6,6) is food, so move to (6,6) on turn 28 to eat.\n\nBut from (5,5) to (6,5) is moving right, then to (6,6) is moving up.\n\nOn turn 27 at (5,5), move to (6,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen on turn 28, at (6,5), move to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut (6,6) is at turn 28, life span: at turn 19 L=10, turn 28 L=1, so can be eaten on turn 28.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the sequence:\n\nTurn 28: move to (6,5) from (5,5)\n\nThen turn 29: move to (6,6) eat? No, on turn 28 I move to (6,5), then on turn 29 to (6,6).\n\nBut on turn 29, food gone.\n\nI need to move to (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nFrom where? If I am at (6,5) on turn 28, I can move to (6,6) on turn 28? No, on one turn, I move one step.\n\nOn turn 28, I am at some position, say at (5,5), I move to (6,5) or (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so to (6,5).\n\nThen on turn 29, from (6,5) move to (6,6), but food gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 28, I need to be at (6,5) or (5,6) or (6,7) etc, but only (6,5) is possible, and move to (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nBut moving to (6,6) on turn 28 means I was at an adjacent cell on turn 27.\n\nSo if on turn 27 I am at (6,5), then turn 28 move to (6,6) eat.\n\nSimilarly, if at (5,6) but obstacle.\n\nOr (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only from (6,5).\n\nSo I need to be at (6,5) on turn 27.\n\nThen turn 28 move to (6,6) eat.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 22 at (3,2):\n\nTurn 23: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 26: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nTo (5,5) on turn 26, then turn 27 to (6,5).\n\nTurn 26 at (5,4), move to (5,5) on turn 27? Turn 26 position.\n\nTurn 25 at (5,3), turn 26 to (5,4), turn 27 to (5,5), turn 28 to (6,5), turn 29 to (6,6) late.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 26, I can move to (6,4) but obstacle, no.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,5) by turn 27 from (3,2) on turn 22 in 5 turns? Turn 22 to turn 27 is 5 turns later, but positions.\n\nTurn 22: at (3,2)\n\nTurn 23: to (4,2) or (4,3) directly? Not, from (3,2) to (4,3) not adjacent.\n\nTo (4,2) t23, then to (4,3) t24, then to (5,3) t25, then to (5,4) t26, then to (5,5) t27, then to (6,5) t28, then to (6,6) t29 late.\n\nFrom (5,3) on t25, move to (6,3) but (6,3) food gone or not, but on t25, (6,3) gone since life span 4, gone after t22.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps a different path, like via (3,3) earlier.\n\nBut in our initial choice, we are at (3,2) on turn 22.\n\nTo reach (6,6) by turn 28, I need to be faster.\n\nFor example, from turn 21 at (3,1), instead of to (3,2), move to (4,1) on turn 22.\n\nTurn 21 at (3,1): after move from (2,1), positions H(3,1), P1(2,1), P2(2,2), P3(2,3), P4(1,3), P5(1,4), P6(1,5)\n\nTurn 22: move R to (4,1)\n\nThen at (4,1), turn 23 move to (4,2), turn 24 to (4,3), same as before.\n\nNo faster.\n\nOr from (4,1) move to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo I think I cannot reach (6,6) in time from here, but it's not critical, since survival is key, and I already ate one food.\n\nI can go for other areas.\n\nBut there is no other food.\n\nSo perhaps for the action sequence, I can provide up to turn 23 or so, and then adapt.\n\nSince the food at (6,6) has long life, but in this path, I may not eat it, but I can survive to eat other food that may spawn, but the state doesn't say, so assume only these food.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is better, but (6,3) is risky and short-lived, (2,1) is eaten, (6,6) may not be reachable in time, but life span 10, turn 19 to 28, so from (3,1) on turn 21, I have 7 turns to reach it, which is possible.\n\nFrom (3,1) on turn 21 to (6,6) in 7 turns: for example, (3,1) -> (4,1) but (5,1) obstacle, so not.\n\n(3,1) -> (3,2) t21? Turn 21 at (3,1), move to (3,2) t22, then to (4,2) t23, (4,3) t24, (5,3) t25, (5,4) t26, (5,5) t27, (6,5) t28, (6,6) t29 late.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,4) obstacle, no.\n\nFrom (4,3) on t24, move to (4,4) t25, then (5,4) t26, same.\n\nOr from (3,2) on t22, move to (4,2) t23, then to (4,3) t24, then to (4,4) t25, then to (5,4) t26, (5,5) t27, (6,5) t28, (6,6) t29.\n\nStill late.\n\nTo save a turn, from (3,1) on turn 21, move to (4,1) but (4,1) free, then to (4,2) t22, same.\n\nOr from (4,2) move to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo I think it's not possible to reach (6,6) from here by turn 28, so I might not eat it, but I can survive long by not going into dead ends.\n\nFor the action sequence, I'll go with the first choice and provide 5 turns.\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D (eat food)\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: R (to (4,2))\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to box the actions.\n\nSince the state changes, the actions for future turns depend on the state, but I think for this exercise, I need to provide a fixed sequence based on current state.\n\nPerhaps assume no other changes.\n\nSo I'll provide:\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: R\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut to be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. The snake starts at turn 19 with head at (2,3) and direction right. The grid has walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. Food is at (6,3) (life span 4, value +1), (2,1) (life span 7, value +1), and (6,6) (life span 10, value +1). All food is positive, but (6,3) has a short life span and leads to a dead end if eaten, so it should be avoided. (2,1) is safe to eat immediately and provides an early score increase. (6,6) has a long life span but may not be reachable before it expires given the path; survival is prioritized over eating it if risky.\n\nAt turn 19, possible moves from (2,3) are down (D) or right (R), as up is blocked by an obstacle and left causes body collision. Moving down to (2,2) allows eating (2,1) on turn 20 for +1 score. Moving right to (3,3) risks trapping the snake near (6,3). Thus, moving down is safer and sets up for early food consumption.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), the snake must move right to (3,1) on turn 21 to avoid a dead end at (1,1). Then, moving up to (3,2) on turn 22 opens up space. On turn 23, moving right to (4,2) heads toward open areas for long-term survival. This path avoids known risks and dead ends.\n\nPlanned actions for turns 19-23:\n- **Turn 19: D (down)** to (2,2) – Avoids (6,3) risk and positions to eat (2,1).\n- **Turn 20: D (down)** to (2,1) – Eats positive food, +1 score, length increases to 7.\n- **Turn 21: R (right)** to (3,1) – Essential to escape bottom-left; moving left to (1,1) is fatal.\n- **Turn 22: U (up)** to (3,2) – Gains maneuverability; moving down or right is possible but up is safer for future options.\n- **Turn 23: R (right)** to (4,2) – Heads toward open grid center, away from borders and obstacles.\n\nBeyond turn 23, the snake should navigate toward open areas (e.g., (4,3) or (5,3)) to survive longer, but (6,6) may expire by turn 28. Survival is ensured for at least 5 turns, and the sequence avoids all immediate collisions and dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: D \\\\\nTurn 20: D \\\\\nTurn 21: R \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's 8 cells wide and 8 cells high. Cells like (0,0) to (7,7) are the playable area, but the borders are walls, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,2), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is D, which is down, meaning the snake is moving downwards. Since it's moving down, the next position from (3,2) down would be to (3,1), but I need to check if that's possible.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,3) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive in this case, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n\nLife span: for (6,3), life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is t=21, after this turn, it will have 1 life left, and after turn 22, it disappears. Similarly, (2,1) has life span 5, so it will last until turn 25 (21+5-1? Let's calculate properly.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn t, a food with life span L will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, it will be gone at turn t + L. Because:\n\n- At turn t, it has L turns left including t, so after t, it has L-1, after t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, it has 1, then after that turn, it disappears, so it's gone at the start of turn t+L. I think it's better to think in terms of remaining life.\n\nAt turn t, food has life span L, meaning it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns. So it disappears at the beginning of turn t + L.\n\nFor (6,3): life span 2 at turn 21, so it will be there on turn 21 and 22, gone on turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): life span 5, present on turns 21,22,23,24,25, gone on 26.\n\n(6,6): life span 8, present on turns 21 to 28, gone on 29.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,2), direction down. So from (3,2), moving down would go to (3,1). But let's check if (3,1) is valid.\n\nFirst, is (3,1) a wall? Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not a border wall. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=3, y=1 should be within bounds. y=0 is wall, so y=1 is row 1, which is playable. Similarly, internal obstacles: list is [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]. (5,1) is an obstacle, but (3,1) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n\nBut is (3,1) occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So (3,1) is not in the snake body, so it should be empty.\n\nMoving down to (3,1) seems possible.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (3,2) with head direction D (down).\n\nSince direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is down, so opposite is up, so I cannot move up. Allowed moves: D, L, R.\n\nSo from (3,2):\n\n- Down to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,2)\n\n- Right to (4,2)\n\nNow, check each for immediate safety.\n\n(3,1): as above, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake body except possibly tail, but tail is at (1,5), far away. Snake body: (3,2) is head, (3,3) is first body, etc., so (3,1) is free.\n\n(2,2): is this valid? x=2,y=2. Walls: not border, since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed. Snake: (3,2) is head, (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), etc. (2,2) not in positions, so free.\n\n(4,2): similarly, x=4,y=2, not border, not obstacle (obstacles at (6,4),(5,1),etc., (4,2) not there), not snake, so free.\n\nAll three moves seem safe immediately.\n\nBut I need to consider food and future positions.\n\nFood locations:\n\n(6,3) at (6,3) with life span 2, so only available for 2 turns including this one. After turn 22, gone.\n\n(2,1) at (2,1) with life span 5, available longer.\n\n(6,6) at (6,6) with life span 8, available longest.\n\nSnake is at (3,2), so (2,1) is close, at (2,1), which is left and down from head? Head (3,2), (2,1) is left and down, so distance: Δx=1 left, Δy=1 down, so Manhattan distance 2.\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), from (3,2), Δx=3 right, Δy=1 up? y=3 vs y=2, so same y? (3,2) to (6,3): x from 3 to 6, +3, y from 2 to 3, +1, so distance 4.\n\n(6,6) from (3,2): Δx=3, Δy=4, distance 7.\n\nAlso, there might be risks with tail or body.\n\nNow, since (6,3) has short life, I should consider going for it if possible, but need to see if I can reach it in time.\n\nLife span 2, so must be eaten on turn 21 or 22.\n\nCurrent turn 21, I can move this turn or next to eat it.\n\nFrom head (3,2), to (6,3) is 3 steps right and 1 up, but since I can only move one cell per turn, min moves is max(Δx,Δy) = max(3,1) =3 moves? From (3,2) to (6,3), I need to move right three times and up once, but I can do it in different orders, min 3 moves if I go diagonally, but I can only move orthogonally, so min 3 moves: e.g., right to (4,2), then right to (5,2), then up to (5,3)? (5,3) to (6,3) is one more right.\n\n(3,2) to (6,3): positions: (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2) -> (6,2) -> (6,3), that's 4 moves if I go all right then up, or I could go (3,2)->(3,3) up, but (3,3) is occupied by snake body, so I cannot move there. Snake body is at (3,3), which is directly above head? Head at (3,2), down direction, so previous head was at (3,3) I think? Snake positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], so (3,2) is head, (3,3) is the first body segment, which is above it, since head moving down to (3,2) from (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,2), moving up to (3,3) is not possible because it's occupied by body. Similarly, moving down to (3,1) is free.\n\nSo to reach (6,3), which is at (6,3), from (3,2), I need to go right.\n\nPossible paths: one way is down to (3,1), then right to (4,1), then right to (5,1), but (5,1) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,1), so I cannot go to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is blocked.\n\nSo from (3,1), I can go to (4,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, so I cannot go to (5,1) or through it.\n\n(4,1) to (5,1) not possible, but I can go from (4,1) to (4,2) or (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so (4,0) invalid.\n\n(4,1) can go to (4,2), (5,1) blocked, (4,0) wall, or (3,1) but that's back.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I go right to (4,2), then I can go right to (5,2), but (5,2) is also an obstacle! Internal obstacles include (5,2), so (5,2) blocked.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (5,2)? No, (5,2) obstacle.\n\n(4,2) to (4,3) or (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (6,3) is at (6,3), and I need to get there.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go up to (4,3), but (4,3) is free? Check obstacles: not listed, walls not, snake? Snake at (3,3),(2,3), etc, not (4,3).\n\nThen from (4,3) to (5,3), (5,3) free? Obstacles: (5,1),(5,2),(5,6), not (5,3), so free. Then (5,3) to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) has food.\n\nNow, from head (3,2) to (4,2) is one move right, then to (4,3) up, then to (5,3) right, then to (6,3) right. So three moves: turn 21 move to (4,2), turn 22 to (4,3), turn 23 to (5,3), but food at (6,3) disappears after turn 22? Life span 2 at turn 21, so present turn 21 and 22, gone turn 23.\n\nIf I move to (4,2) on turn 21, then on turn 22 I can move to (4,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so to (4,3) or (3,2) back or (4,1), but from (4,2) to (6,3) in one move? No, not adjacent.\n\n(4,2) to (6,3) not adjacent, need two moves: e.g., to (5,3) then (6,3), but (5,3) from (4,2) is not adjacent; (4,2) to (5,2) blocked, to (4,3) then to (5,3) is possible, but that takes two moves from (4,2).\n\nTurn 21: move from (3,2) to (4,2) — position at end of turn 21: head at (4,2), body follows, so snake becomes [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]? Positions: old head (3,2) becomes body, new head (4,2), then previous body (3,3), (2,3), etc. And tail (1,5) is removed? When moving, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail is removed, so length same.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten yet.\n\nSo after move to (4,2), snake: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail was (1,5), but since no food, tail removed, so positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]? Let's list: new head (4,2), then the previous head (3,2) is now first body, then (3,3) second body, (2,3) third, (1,3) fourth, (1,4) fifth, and (1,5) was tail, removed, so snake has 5 segments? Original 6 segments, after move without eating, tail removed, so 5 segments.\n\nOriginal positions: 6 cells. When snake moves, head to new cell, each body segment to previous segment position, tail cell is vacated. So new length same as before, unless food eaten.\n\nHere, no food, so after move, snake has 6 segments but positions shift: head new, then body 1 to old head, body 2 to old body 1, etc., tail to old second last, and old tail removed.\n\nPositions: let's index: head index 0: (3,2), body1: (3,3), body2: (2,3), body3: (1,3), body4: (1,4), body5/tail: (1,5)\n\nAfter move, say to (3,1) down: new head (3,1), then body1: old head (3,2), body2: old body1 (3,3), body3: old body2 (2,3), body4: old body3 (1,3), body5: old body4 (1,4), and old tail (1,5) removed. So new positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] — still 6 segments? (1,4) was body4, now becomes body5/tail, and (1,5) removed, but (1,4) is still there, so yes, positions from head to tail: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — 6 segments, tail at (1,4).\n\nSimilarly, if move to (4,2): head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail at (1,4), since (1,5) removed.\n\n(1,4) was previously occupied, but now it's the tail.\n\nBack to reaching (6,3).\n\nFood at (6,3) must be eaten on turn 21 or 22.\n\nOn turn 21, from (3,2), can I move directly to (6,3)? No, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (3,2) are (3,1) down, (3,3) up but occupied, (2,2) left, (4,2) right. None is (6,3), so cannot eat on turn 21.\n\nOn turn 22, if I move to a cell adjacent to (6,3), then I can eat it.\n\n(6,3) adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,4), (5,3), (7,3) but x=7 wall, so (6,2), (6,4), (5,3).\n\n(6,4) is internal obstacle, so blocked. (6,2) and (5,3) are possible.\n\nSo to eat on turn 22, I need to be at (6,2) or (5,3) at the start of turn 22, meaning after move on turn 21.\n\nAt start of turn 21, head at (3,2).\n\nAfter move on turn 21, head at new position for turn 22.\n\nSo to be at (6,2) or (5,3) at start of turn 22.\n\nFrom (3,2), in one move, I can go to (3,1), (2,2), or (4,2).\n\nNone of these is (6,2) or (5,3), so I cannot reach a position to eat on turn 22 directly.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), I am at (4,2) start of turn 22, then I can move to (4,3), (4,1), (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, (3,2), or (4,2) stay? No, must move.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves: up to (4,3), down to (4,1), left to (3,2), right to (5,2) blocked. So only (4,3), (4,1), (3,2).\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to (5,3), but not to (6,3). (5,3) is adjacent to (6,3).\n\nBut from (4,2) to (5,3) is not adjacent, different x and y.\n\nSo on turn 22, from (4,2), I can go to (4,3), then from (4,3) I can go to (5,3) on turn 23, but turn 23 food is gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,1) on turn 21, then turn 22 head at (3,1), can go to (3,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, or (2,1), or (4,1), or (3,2) but (3,2) is now body.\n\nAt turn 22, after moving to (3,1) on turn 21, snake positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (3,1), can move down to (3,0) wall, left to (2,1), right to (4,1), up to (3,2) which is body, occupied, so not possible. So only (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(2,1) has food, but let's see later.\n\nNeither (2,1) nor (4,1) is adjacent to (6,3), so I cannot reach (6,3) on turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (2,2) on turn 21, then turn 22 head at (2,2), can move to (2,1), (2,3), (1,2) obstacle, or (3,2) body.\n\n(2,1) has food, but not related to (6,3).\n\nSo in all cases, I cannot reach (6,3) on turn 21 or 22 to eat it, because it's too far with obstacles. Min distance is at least 3 moves, but I can only make 2 moves by turn 22, and after that it's gone. So I cannot eat (6,3) at all. It will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSo forget about (6,3), it's not reachable in time.\n\nNow, other food: (2,1) at (2,1) with life span 5, so can be eaten on turns 21 to 25.\n\n(6,6) with life span 8, turns 21 to 28.\n\n(2,1) is close to head. From (3,2) to (2,1) is adjacent left-down, but I can move directly left to (2,2) or down to (3,1), but not directly to (2,1) since not adjacent diagonally.\n\n(2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) and (3,1), etc.\n\nSo I can reach (2,1) in one or two moves.\n\nFor example, move left to (2,2) on turn 21, then from there, on turn 22, I can move down to (2,1) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, move down to (3,1) on turn 21, then left to (2,1) on turn 22.\n\nBoth ways take two turns to eat, but I can eat on turn 22.\n\n(6,6) is farther.\n\nAlso, need to consider the snake body and tail movement.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,5). Head at (3,2), not adjacent. Adjacent cells to tail (1,5) are (1,4), (1,6), (0,5), (2,5). (1,4) is body, (1,6) y=6? y=7 is wall, so y=6 ok, but not occupied, (0,5) x=0 wall, (2,5) free? But head at (3,2), not adjacent to tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut after moves, it might be.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all obstacles to avoid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)\n\nSo blocked cells: (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nNow, snake positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nFree cells elsewhere.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,2) with direction D: down, left, right.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (3,1)\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction down or whatever I choose, but after moving down, new direction is down.\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves: down to (3,0) wall, invalid; left to (2,1); right to (4,1); up to (3,2) but (3,2) will be body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), snake positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail at (1,4), since (1,5) removed.\n\nThen from (3,1), can move to (2,1), (4,1), or (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, so only (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(2,1) has food, so if I move to (2,1), I eat the food, length increases.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is free.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (2,2)\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction left (since moved left).\n\nSnake: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail at (1,4)\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: up to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, occupied; down to (2,1); left to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle; right to (3,2) occupied. So only possible move is down to (2,1).\n\nBecause up, left, right all blocked or occupied, only down to (2,1) is free and not occupied.\n\n(2,1) is free, no obstacle, not occupied.\n\nSo from (2,2), only move is to (2,1), then eat the food there.\n\nOption 3: Move right to (4,2)\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction right.\n\nSnake: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail at (1,4)\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves: up to (4,3); down to (4,1); left to (3,2) occupied; right to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle. So only (4,3) or (4,1).\n\nNow, if I go to (4,3), then I can later go to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) food is closer.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food when possible, but also think long-term.\n\n(2,1) can be eaten soon, on turn 22 if I move towards it.\n\n(6,6) is farther, but has longer life.\n\nBut since I can eat multiple, I should eat (2,1) first as it's close.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat it, someone else might, but it's single player, I think, so no competition.\n\nThe state doesn't say other snakes, so just me.\n\nNow, let's consider the options.\n\nFirst, if I move down to (3,1) on turn 21.\n\nThen on turn 22, from (3,1), I can move to (2,1) to eat the food, or to (4,1).\n\nIf I move to (2,1), I eat the food, so length increases to 7, and new tail is grown, so positions: after eating, head to (2,1), body added, so snake: head (2,1), then previous head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — and since food eaten, tail not removed, so (1,4) remains, and new segment, so positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] — 7 segments, tail at (1,4).\n\n(1,4) was tail before, but now it's not tail, new tail is (1,4)? Let's list: new head (2,1), then the first body is old head (3,1), then old body1 (3,2), then old body2 (3,3), then old body3 (2,3), then old body4 (1,3), then old tail (1,4) now body5, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail position is where the new segment is added? Standard snake: when food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new head moves to food, and the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nAfter move to food cell, the head is on food, and the body follows, but the tail doesn't advance, so the new position has the head at food, then the previous head, etc., and the previous tail remains.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to food: new head at food, then H, B1, B2, ..., T, so length +1.\n\nIn this case, before turn 21 move, snake: [(3,2)H, (3,3)B1, (2,3)B2, (1,3)B3, (1,4)B4, (1,5)T]\n\nAfter move down to (3,1) no food: head to (3,1), then H to (3,2), B1 to (3,3), B2 to (2,3), B3 to (1,3), B4 to (1,4), T (1,5) removed, so [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] length 6.\n\nIf on turn 22, move to (2,1) and eat food: head to (2,1), then previous head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), and tail remains, so new positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] length 7, tail at (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is now the tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (2,2) on turn 21.\n\nAfter move to (2,2) no food: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — tail (1,4), length 6.\n\nThen on turn 22, only move down to (2,1) to eat food: head to (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — and since food eaten, tail (1,4) remains, so new positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] length 7, tail at (1,4).\n\nNow, if I move right to (4,2) on turn 21, then on turn 22, I can go to (4,3) or (4,1), not towards (2,1) directly, so I might not eat it immediately.\n\nBut I can eat it later, since it has life span 5, so by turn 25.\n\nBut to maximize, eating sooner is better to free up space or something, but not necessary.\n\nHowever, there is risk if I delay.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but here grid has space.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail danger after eating.\n\nFor example, if I eat (2,1) on turn 22, tail is at (1,4) or (1,4) in both cases.\n\nIn first case, after eating, tail at (1,4), head at (2,1), which are not adjacent; (2,1) to (1,4) distance |2-1| + |1-4| =1+3=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nThen I can plan to go to other food.\n\n(6,6) at (6,6), which is far.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles, so I need a path.\n\nMoreover, the snake body might block paths.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (6,6) has long life, but I should eat (2,1) soon since it's easy.\n\nBut let's see if there is any reason not to.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1) on turn 21, then to (2,1) on turn 22 to eat.\n\nOr if I move left to (2,2) on turn 21, then to (2,1) on turn 22 to eat.\n\nOr if I move right, I don't eat on turn 22.\n\nBut moving right might allow me to explore or something.\n\nBut (6,3) is gone, so no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (6,6) directly, but it's far.\n\nLet's simulate the moves.\n\nFirst, prioritize eating (2,1) since it's close and will be gone sooner relatively, but both have time.\n\nLife span 5 vs 8, but 5 is shorter, so should eat it first.\n\nAlso, to avoid missing it if something happens.\n\nSo I think best to eat (2,1) on turn 22.\n\nTo do that, I need to be at (2,2) or (3,1) or (2,1) adjacent on turn 21, but (2,1) not adjacent from (3,2), so on turn 21, move to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), on turn 22, I must move to (2,1) to eat, as it's the only move.\n\nFrom (3,1), on turn 22, I can choose to move to (2,1) to eat or to (4,1).\n\nIf I move to (2,1), I eat, but if I move to (4,1), I don't eat yet.\n\nBut since (2,1) is there, I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, from (3,1), moving to (4,1) might not be better.\n\nAnother point: the tail is at (1,5) now, but after moves, it moves.\n\nBut let's think about the grid after eating.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), snake is longer, and tail at (1,4) or something.\n\nThen I can go to (6,6).\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,6) is at (6,6), and I need to reach it.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, I can move to other places.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nPerhaps I should plan a path to (6,6).\n\nFirst, let's decide the first move.\n\nSince moving left to (2,2) forces me to go to (2,1) next, which eats the food.\n\nMoving down to (3,1) also allows me to go to (2,1) next to eat.\n\nMoving right to (4,2) delays eating.\n\nBut moving right might be safer or better for long term.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (4,2) on turn 21.\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,2), I can go up to (4,3) or down to (4,1).\n\nSay I go to (4,3) on turn 22.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction up.\n\nSnake: after turn 21 move to (4,2), positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] tail (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,3) on turn 22, no food, so head to (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), and tail (1,4) removed, so [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] length 6, tail at (1,3).\n\n(1,4) removed.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to (4,4), (5,3), (4,2) but (4,2) body, (3,3) body, so only (4,4) or (5,3) if free.\n\n(4,4) free? No obstacle, not wall, not snake, so free.\n\n(5,3) free, yes.\n\nSay I go to (5,3) on turn 23, then to (6,3) but (6,3) food gone by turn 23, so no food, just move.\n\nThen from (5,3) to (6,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), so I need to go there.\n\nFrom (5,3), to (6,6) is not direct.\n\nBut I can go to (6,3) on turn 24 if still there, but gone.\n\nLife span gone.\n\nThen to (6,6), from (5,3), I can go to (5,4), (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, (6,3), (4,3) body, so (5,4) or (6,3).\n\n(6,3) gone, so to (5,4) on turn 24.\n\nThen from (5,4) to (5,5), (5,3) body, (6,4) obstacle, (4,4), etc.\n\n(6,4) obstacle, so to (5,5) or (4,4).\n\nSay to (5,5) on turn 25.\n\nThen to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, or (6,5), or (5,4) body, so to (6,5) on turn 26.\n\nThen to (6,6) on turn 27 to eat.\n\nBut (6,6) life span 8, at turn 21, gone on turn 29, so turn 27 is ok, turn 28 last, turn 29 gone.\n\nTurn 27 is before turn 29, so can eat.\n\nBut this is slow, and I missed (2,1) food.\n\nOn turn 21, I moved right to (4,2), then on turn 22 to (4,3), turn 23 to (5,3), turn 24 to (5,4), turn 25 to (5,5), turn 26 to (6,5), turn 27 to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut (2,1) food is not eaten, and it disappears on turn 26? Life span 5 at turn 21, present turns 21-25, gone turn 26.\n\nOn turn 25, I am at (5,5), not near (2,1), so I cannot eat (2,1), it disappears uneaten.\n\nSo I missed one food.\n\nIf I eat (2,1) first, I can still go to (6,6).\n\nFor example, on turn 21 move down to (3,1) or left to (2,2).\n\nSay move left to (2,2) on turn 21.\n\nThen on turn 22 move down to (2,1) to eat.\n\nAfter turn 22, snake: as earlier, [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] head (2,1), tail (1,4)\n\nDirection after moving down to (2,1), so direction down.\n\nNow from (2,1), possible moves: down to (2,0) wall; left to (1,1); right to (3,1); up to (2,2) body.\n\n(2,2) is body, occupied, so cannot move up.\n\nDown to (2,0) invalid.\n\nSo only left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is free? Walls: x=0,y=0 walls, (1,1) x=1,y=1, not border. Obstacles: not listed, so free. Snake: not occupied, so free.\n\n(3,1) free.\n\nNow, I can go to (3,1) or (1,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go to (4,1) etc towards (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (2,1), moving right to (3,1) is better.\n\nThen from (3,1) to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) to (5,1) blocked, so cannot go directly right.\n\nFrom (3,1), move to (4,1) on turn 23.\n\nThen from (4,1), can move to (4,2), (4,0) wall, (5,1) obstacle, (3,1) body.\n\nSo only to (4,2) on turn 24.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (4,3) or (4,1) body, (5,2) obstacle, (3,2) body, so to (4,3) on turn 25.\n\nThen from (4,3) to (4,4) or (5,3) on turn 26.\n\nSay to (5,3) on turn 26.\n\nThen to (5,4) on turn 27, to (5,5) on turn 28, to (6,5) on turn 29, but (6,6) gone on turn 29? Life span 8, at turn 21, gone on turn 29, so on turn 28 it is still there, turn 29 gone.\n\nTurn 28: if I am at (6,5), I can move to (6,6) to eat on turn 28.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nTurn 21: move left to (2,2)\n\nTurn 22: move down to (2,1) eat\n\nThen turn 23: from (2,1) move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 24: from (3,1) move right to (4,1)? (4,1) is free, but from (3,1) to (4,1) is right, direction east.\n\nThen turn 25: from (4,1) move to (4,2) up? (4,1) to (4,2) is up, y+1.\n\nThen turn 26: from (4,2) to (4,3) up\n\nTurn 27: from (4,3) to (5,3) right\n\nTurn 28: from (5,3) to (5,4) up? Or to (6,3) but (6,3) gone, or (5,4)\n\n(5,3) to (5,4) up, or to (6,3) right, but (6,3) no food or gone.\n\nBetter to go to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 29: from (5,4) to (5,5) up or to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so to (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) to (6,5) or (5,6) obstacle, so to (6,5) on turn 30, then to (6,6) on turn 31, but (6,6) gone on turn 29, so too late.\n\nMistake.\n\n(6,6) life span 8 at turn 21: present turns 21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28, gone turn 29.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 28.\n\nOn turn 28, I need to be at (6,6) or adjacent to move to it.\n\nIn the path above, on turn 28, where am I?\n\nTurn 21: move to (2,2) — not eating\n\nTurn 22: move to (2,1) eat — head at (2,1)\n\nTurn 23: move to (3,1) — head (3,1)\n\nTurn 24: move to (4,1) — head (4,1)\n\nTurn 25: move to (4,2) — head (4,2)\n\nTurn 26: move to (4,3) — head (4,3)\n\nTurn 27: move to (5,3) — head (5,3)\n\nTurn 28: from (5,3), I can move to (6,3) or (5,4)\n\n(6,3) is gone, no food, but I can move there, but not to eat.\n\nTo eat (6,6), I need to be at (5,6) or (6,5) or (7,6) wall or (6,7) wall, so only (5,6) or (6,5).\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, blocked.\n\n(6,5) is free? Obstacles not listed, walls not, so free.\n\nSo from (5,3) on turn 28, I can move to (6,3) or (5,4), not directly to (6,5) or (5,6).\n\n(6,5) is not adjacent to (5,3); adjacent are (5,2) blocked, (5,4), (6,3), (4,3).\n\nSo on turn 28, I am at (5,3), I move to (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nThen turn 29, from there to (5,5) or (6,4) blocked, etc, but (6,6) gone.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 28, I can only reach (6,6) if I am at (6,5) or (5,6) but (5,6) blocked, so only (6,5) on turn 28 to move to (6,6) on turn 28, but on turn 28 I am at (5,3), not at (6,5).\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,6) by turn 28 from this path.\n\nIf from (4,3) on turn 26, I go to (5,3) on 27, same.\n\nOr from (4,3) on turn 26, I can go to (4,4), then to (4,5), etc, but slower.\n\nTurn 26 at (4,3), to (4,4) turn 27, to (4,5) turn 28, still not close to (6,6).\n\nSo from (2,1) after eating, it takes many moves to reach (6,6), and I might not make it in time.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1) on turn 21 instead.\n\nTurn 21: move down to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 22: move left to (2,1) eat — same as above, head at (2,1) on turn 22.\n\nSame situation.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), I can move to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nIf I move to (3,1), same as above.\n\nIf I move to (1,1) on turn 23.\n\nThen from (1,1), can move to (1,0) wall, (1,2) obstacle, (2,1) body, (0,1) wall, so no move possible? (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,1), only possible moves: down to (1,0) invalid, up to (1,2) obstacle, left to (0,1) wall, right to (2,1) body. All invalid or occupied, so dead end, snake dies.\n\nOh! Big problem.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), if I am at (2,1) and I move to (1,1), but from (1,1) there is no safe move, because all adjacent cells are invalid or occupied or obstacle.\n\nSpecifically, after eating at (2,1) on turn 22, positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] or depending on how I came.\n\nIn the case where I moved down to (3,1) on 21, then to (2,1) on 22 eat: positions before turn 22 move: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,1) eat: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — 7 segments, tail (1,4)\n\nThen from (2,1), if I move left to (1,1) on turn 23: head to (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) — and tail (1,4) removed? No, when moving to new cell, if not food, tail removed, but here moving to (1,1), no food mentioned, so no eat, tail removed.\n\nPositions: new head (1,1), then previous head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) — and old tail (1,4) removed, so snake: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] length 7, tail at (1,3)\n\nNow, from (1,1), possible moves: up to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle; down to (1,0) wall; left to (0,1) wall; right to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, occupied. All moves invalid, so snake collides or stuck, dies.\n\nTherefore, moving to (1,1) is fatal.\n\nFrom (2,1), I must move right to (3,1), not left.\n\nIn the other approach, when I moved left to (2,2) on 21, then down to (2,1) eat on 22, positions: before turn 22 move: after turn 21 to (2,2), snake: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] tail (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,1) eat: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — 7 segments, tail (1,4)\n\nThen from (2,1), move to (3,1) or (1,1).\n\nMove to (1,1) same problem, fatal.\n\nMove to (3,1) on turn 23: head to (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) — tail (1,4) removed, so [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] length 7, tail at (1,3)\n\nNow from (3,1), I can move to (4,1) or (2,1) body, (3,2) body, (3,0) invalid, so only to (4,1) on turn 24.\n\nThen same as before, to (4,2) on turn 25, etc, and I can reach (6,6) if I go directly.\n\nBut earlier, to reach (6,6) by turn 28.\n\nFrom (3,1) on turn 23, move to (4,1) on 24, to (4,2) on 25, to (4,3) on 26, to (5,3) on 27, to (6,3) on 28 but (6,3) gone, or to (5,4) on 28.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 27, I can move to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nOn turn 28, from (5,4) or (6,3), I can move to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, or (5,5), or (6,5) from (6,3) not adjacent.\n\n(5,4) to (6,4) obstacle, to (5,5), to (4,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) to (5,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen to (6,5) on turn 29, but (6,6) gone on turn 29.\n\nOn turn 28, from (5,4), I can move to (5,5) or (6,4) blocked, or (4,4), or (5,3) body.\n\nNone adjacent to (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) on turn 28, I need to be at (6,5) or (5,6) or (6,7) etc, but (5,6) obstacle, (6,7) wall, so only (6,5).\n\nSo I need to be at (6,5) on turn 28 to move to (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nBut from the path, on turn 28 I am at (5,4) or (5,3), not (6,5).\n\nSo I cannot reach in time.\n\nTherefore, if I eat (2,1) first, I may not be able to reach (6,6) in time to eat it.\n\nBut there might be a faster path.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,1), at (2,1), turn 22, move to (3,1) on turn 23.\n\nThen from (3,1), instead of to (4,1), I can go up? From (3,1), moves: down invalid, left to (2,1) body, right to (4,1), up to (3,2) body, so only to (4,1), no choice.\n\nThen to (4,1) on 24, to (4,2) on 25, to (4,3) on 26.\n\nFrom (4,3), on turn 26, I can move to (4,4) or (5,3).\n\nIf I go to (5,3) on turn 27.\n\nThen on turn 27 at (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or (6,3).\n\n(6,3) gone, so to (5,4) on turn 28.\n\nBut on turn 28, I am at (5,4), not at (6,5), so I cannot move to (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nIf from (4,3) on turn 26, I go to (4,4), then to (4,5) on 27, to (4,6) on 28, still not close.\n\nOr to (5,5) from (4,4) to (5,4) etc, but (5,4) on 27, to (5,5) on 28, then to (6,5) on 29, too late.\n\nSo it seems I cannot reach (6,6) by turn 28 if I eat (2,1) first.\n\nBut if I don't eat (2,1), and go directly to (6,6), I can eat both.\n\nFor example, on turn 21, move right to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 22, move to (4,3).\n\nOn turn 23, move to (5,3).\n\nOn turn 24, move to (5,4).\n\nOn turn 25, move to (5,5).\n\nOn turn 26, move to (6,5).\n\nOn turn 27, move to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut on turn 27, (6,6) is still there, turn 28 last, so turn 27 ok.\n\nNow, what about (2,1)? On turn 25, (2,1) is still there, life span 5, present until turn 25.\n\nOn turn 25, I am at (5,5), far from (2,1), so I cannot eat it.\n\nMissed (2,1).\n\nBut I can eat (2,1) on the way or something.\n\nFrom head at (3,2), turn 21, move down to (3,1).\n\nThen on turn 22, instead of eating (2,1), I can move to (4,1) to go towards (6,6).\n\nBut (4,1) is available.\n\nTurn 21: move down to (3,1)\n\nTurn 22: move right to (4,1)  -- not eating (2,1) yet.\n\nThen turn 23: from (4,1) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 26: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 29: to (6,6) but gone on turn 29, so on turn 28 at (6,5), move to (6,6) on turn 28 to eat, last chance.\n\nOn turn 28, (6,6) is present.\n\nBut (2,1) is not eaten, gone on turn 26.\n\nMissed.\n\nOn turn 22 from (3,1), I can move to (2,1) to eat, but then I am at (2,1), and as before, I can move to (3,1) on turn 23, then to (4,1) on 24, etc, but as before, on turn 28 I am at (5,4) or something, not at (6,6).\n\nTurn 22: eat at (2,1), head at (2,1)\n\nTurn 23: move to (3,1)\n\nTurn 24: to (4,1)\n\nTurn 25: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 26: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 27: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 28: to (5,4) or (6,3) -- not (6,6)\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 28, I can move to (5,4) or (6,3), neither is (6,5) or (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) on turn 28, I need to be at (6,5) on turn 28.\n\nBut from (5,3) on turn 27, I can move to (5,4) on turn 28, or to (6,3) on turn 28.\n\nFrom (6,3) on turn 28, I can move to (6,2) or (6,4) obstacle or (5,3) body or (7,3) wall, so to (6,2) on turn 29, not to (6,6).\n\nNo.\n\nSo it seems difficult to eat both with the obstacles.\n\nPerhaps I can go via the top or other path.\n\nAnother idea: from (3,2), move left to (2,2) on turn 21, then on turn 22 move down to (2,1) to eat, but then I am at (2,1), and I can move up or something, but from (2,1), I can only move right to (3,1), as left is dangerous.\n\nThen from (3,1), to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so to (4,1) only.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nPerhaps after eating at (2,1), at (2,1), I move to (3,1), then from (3,1) to (3,0) invalid, so to (4,1), then to (4,2), then to (4,3), then to (3,3) but (3,3) may be body.\n\nLet's list the body after eating at (2,1) on turn 22.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nThen on turn 23, move to (3,1) -- but (3,1) is occupied by body, so I cannot move to (3,1) because it's the first body segment.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to a new cell, so from (2,1) to (3,1), but (3,1) is currently occupied by the first body segment, so it would collide.\n\nYes, important point.\n\nAt turn 22 after eating, positions: [ (2,1)H, (3,1)B1, (3,2)B2, (3,3)B3, (2,3)B4, (1,3)B5, (1,4)T ]\n\nIf I move right to (3,1) on turn 23, (3,1) is occupied by B1, so head collides with body, snake dies.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move to (3,1) because it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, I can only move to (1,1) or (3,1), but (3,1) occupied, (1,1) might be free but as before, from (1,1) no move.\n\n(1,1) is free, but after moving to (1,1), it might be ok for that move, but then stuck.\n\nOn turn 23, from (2,1), moving to (1,1): new head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) -- and tail (1,4) removed, so positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] tail at (1,3)\n\nThen from (1,1), as before, all adjacent cells blocked or occupied, so on next turn, no move possible, die.\n\nTherefore, from (2,1) after eating, there is no safe move! Moving to (1,1) leads to death soon, moving to (3,1) is immediate collision.\n\nSo the snake is trapped after eating the food at (2,1) if I go that way.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps if I approach from a different direction.\n\nFor example, if on turn 21, I move down to (3,1), then on turn 22, instead of moving to (2,1), I move to (4,1) to avoid eating, then I can go to (4,2), etc, and not eat (2,1), so it remains, but I can come back later.\n\n(2,1) has life span 5, so until turn 25.\n\nBut after moving to (4,1), I can go to (6,6) and eat on turn 27 or 28, then come back to (2,1) but by turn 25 it might be gone, and it's far.\n\nFor example, on turn 28 at (6,6), to (2,1) is far, min 7 moves, turn 29,30,etc, too late.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,1) later.\n\nFor example, on turn 21, move right to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 22, move to (4,3).\n\nTurn 23 to (5,3).\n\nTurn 24 to (5,4).\n\nTurn 25 to (5,5).\n\nTurn 26 to (6,5).\n\nTurn 27 to (6,6) eat.\n\nNow, on turn 25, I am at (5,5), (2,1) is still present (turn 25), but I am at (5,5), can I move to (2,1) in one move? No, too far.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (2,1) distance |5-2| + |5-1| =3+4=7 moves, min, so on turn 26 to (5,4) or something, not towards (2,1).\n\nSo I miss (2,1).\n\nBut if I want to eat (2,1), I need to go there first.\n\nOn turn 21, move down to (3,1).\n\nThen on turn 22, move to (2,1) to eat, but then I am stuck as before.\n\nUnless after eating, I can move to (2,2) or something, but from (2,1), (2,2) is not adjacent directly; (2,2) is above, but from (2,1), I can move up to (2,2)? (2,2) is at (2,2), which is above (2,1), so move up.\n\nBut after eating at (2,1), the body includes (3,1), (3,2), etc, so (2,2) might be free.\n\nAt turn 22 after eating at (2,1): positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) ]\n\n(2,2) is not occupied, so from (2,1), I can move up to (2,2)?\n\n(2,2) is free? No obstacle, not wall, not in snake positions, so yes, free.\n\nThen I can move to (2,2) on turn 23.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1) on turn 22, head at (2,1), positions as above.\n\nOn turn 23, move up to (2,2): new head (2,2), then previous head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) -- and tail (1,4) removed, so positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] length 7, tail at (1,3)\n\nNow from (2,2), possible moves: up to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, occupied; down to (2,1) body; left to (1,2) obstacle; right to (3,2) body. All adjacent cells are occupied or blocked, so no move possible, die immediately.\n\nSo still trapped.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (2,1) leads to the snake being trapped because of the body positions and obstacles.\n\nSo it's better not to eat it at all.\n\nThen I should avoid (2,1) and go directly to (6,6).\n\nBut (2,1) is positive food, but if eating it causes death, I should avoid it.\n\nThe core rules say to maximize score, but prioritize long-term survival.\n\nIf eating it leads to death, I should not eat it.\n\nSo for turn 21, I should move right to (4,2) or down to (3,1) but not towards (2,1).\n\nMove down to (3,1) but then on turn 22 I can move to (4,1) to avoid (2,1).\n\nOr move right to (4,2).\n\nThen go to (6,6).\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,6), which I can eat.\n\nSo let's go for (6,6).\n\nOn turn 21, move right to (4,2).\n\nDirection from down to right, so new direction right.\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,2), move to (4,3) up.\n\nThen on turn 23, from (4,3), move to (5,3) right.\n\nThen on turn 24, from (5,3), move to (5,4) up.\n\nThen on turn 25, from (5,4), move to (5,5) up.\n\nThen on turn 26, from (5,5), move to (6,5) right.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (6,5), move to (6,6) right to eat.\n\nAll these moves should be possible if no body in way.\n\nLet's check the body.\n\nAfter turn 21 move to (4,2): snake [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] tail (1,4)\n\nTurn 22 move to (4,3): no food, so head (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail (1,4) removed, so [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] tail (1,3)\n\nTurn 23 move to (5,3): head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) tail (1,3) removed, so [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)] tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 24 move to (5,4): head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail (2,3) removed, so [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 25 move to (5,5): head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail (3,3) removed, so [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)] tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 26 move to (6,5): head (6,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) tail (3,2) removed, so [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] tail (4,2)\n\nTurn 27 move to (6,6) eat: head to (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) and since food eaten, tail not removed, new segment, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] length 7, tail at (4,2)\n\nAnd (6,6) eaten on turn 27, within life span.\n\nAnd (2,1) not eaten, but it's better than dying.\n\nNow for the first move, on turn 21, I should move right to (4,2).\n\nBut is there a way to eat both? Probably not with the constraints.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,1) after, but not possible.\n\nSo for turn 21, move right to (4,2).\n\nThen the actions for 5 turns: turn 21 to turn 25, but the answer should be for turn t1 to t1+4 or something, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to list.\n\nProbably list the actions for the next few turns, but since it's planning ahead, list for 5 turns.\n\nBut in this case, I have a plan to eat (6,6) on turn 27.\n\nFor the answer, list from turn 21 to, say, turn 25 or 26.\n\nBut let's see the current turn is 21, and I need to output actions for turn 21, 22, etc.\n\nPerhaps output the first move and the plan.\n\nBut the format is to list the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nSo for turn 21: action\n\nTurn 22: action\n\netc.\n\nI think for now, on turn 21, move right to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 22: move up to (4,3)\n\nTurn 23: move right to (5,3)\n\nTurn 24: move up to (5,4)\n\nTurn 25: move up to (5,5)\n\nThen later to (6,5) and (6,6).\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 25.\n\nSince the food at (6,6) is far, but I have a path.\n\nAlso, on turn 21, I could move down to (3,1), then to (4,1), then to (4,2), etc, but similar.\n\nBut moving right directly to (4,2) is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 21, from (3,2), move right to (4,2).\n\nIs there any risk? (4,2) is free, as we checked.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 21: R (right)\n\nTurn 22: U (up to (4,3))\n\nTurn 23: R (right to (5,3))\n\nTurn 24: U (up to (5,4))\n\nTurn 25: U (up to (5,5))\n\nThen turn 26: R to (6,5), turn 27: R to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list at least 5 turns, so up to turn 25.\n\nTurn 21 to turn 25 is 5 turns: 21,22,23,24,25.\n\nActions: 21: R, 22: U, 23: R, 24: U, 25: U\n\nBut on turn 24 to (5,4), turn 25 to (5,5), both up.\n\nNow, is this safe? Let's ensure no collision.\n\nFor example, on turn 23, moving to (5,3), is (5,3) free? At that time, the body is moving, but in the simulation, it was free.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSince I'm not eating (2,1), it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving down to (3,1) on turn 21, then to (4,1) on 22, to (4,2) on 23, etc, but it takes one more turn to reach (4,2), so slower to (6,6).\n\nWith move right on 21, I reach (4,2) faster.\n\nSo better to move right.\n\nTherefore, for turn 21: R\n\nThen for the next turns.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I must avoid eating the food at (2,1) because it leads to a trapped position with no safe moves afterward, risking death. Instead, I will prioritize reaching the food at (6,6) within its lifespan (available until turn 28) while avoiding obstacles and collisions. The food at (6,3) is unreachable within its lifespan (gone after turn 22) and can be ignored.\n\n### Plan Overview (5+ Turns Ahead)\n- **Turn 21**: Move right (R) to (4,2) to start heading toward (6,6) and avoid the dangerous (2,1) area.\n- **Turn 22**: Move up (U) to (4,3) to continue the path, staying clear of obstacles.\n- **Turn 23**: Move right (R) to (5,3) to approach the right side of the grid.\n- **Turn 24**: Move up (U) to (5,4) to navigate around obstacles like (5,2) and (5,6).\n- **Turn 25**: Move up (U) to (5,5) to position for the final approach to (6,6).\n- **Beyond Turn 25**: On turn 26, move right (R) to (6,5), then on turn 27, move right (R) to (6,6) to eat the food safely by turn 27 (within lifespan).\n\nThis plan ensures the snake survives, avoids immediate risks, and secures the +1 score from (6,6). Moving toward (6,6) directly is efficient, and the path avoids all walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n- **Current State (Turn 21)**:\n  - Head at (3,2), direction down (D). Possible moves: down (D) to (3,1), left (L) to (2,2), right (R) to (4,2).\n  - Moving left (L) or down (D) risks approaching (2,1), which, if eaten, traps the snake with no safe moves (e.g., adjacent cells blocked by walls, obstacles, or body).\n  - Moving right (R) to (4,2) is safe and starts an efficient path to (6,6).\n- **Food Considerations**:\n  - (2,1): Eating it causes entrapment; avoid entirely for survival.\n  - (6,3): Unreachable by turn 22; ignore.\n  - (6,6): Lifespan until turn 28; reachable by turn 27 via the planned path.\n- **Path Safety**:\n  - All moves avoid walls (borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5).\n  - Body collisions are avoided as the snake moves away from its body, and the tail moves forward normally.\n  - No tail reward danger, as the head is never adjacent to the tail during this sequence.\n- **Long-Term Survival**:\n  - By not eating (2,1), the snake remains maneuverable and can access more of the grid.\n  - After eating (6,6) on turn 27, the snake can continue exploring for potential new food, but this is beyond the 5-turn horizon.\n\n### Answer Format\nActions for turns 21 to 25 (5 turns):\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: R (right)  \nTurn 22: U (up)  \nTurn 23: R (right)  \nTurn 24: U (up)  \nTurn 25: U (up)\n}",
