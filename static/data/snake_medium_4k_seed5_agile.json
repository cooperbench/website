        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Grid**: It's a 2D grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There are also internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n2. **Snake**: \n   - Current position: head at (3, 3), and since the snake's length is 1, there are no body segments.\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n3. **Food**: Three pieces of food with their positions, life spans (all 10 turns), and values (all +1, meaning they're positive food).\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- Since the snake's length is 1, it's just the head. There's no body to collide with, which simplifies movement.\n- The current direction is Left (L), meaning the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n  \n### Movement Constraints\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the last move was Left (L), the next move cannot be Right (R). So, possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or continue Left (L).\n2. **Wall Collisions**: \n   - Moving Left (L) from (3, 3) would take the snake to (2, 3). Need to check if (2, 3) is a wall or obstacle.\n     - Border walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=2 is not a border.\n     - Internal obstacles: (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 1), (2, 6). (2, 3) is not listed, so it's safe.\n   - Moving Up (U) would go to (3, 4). Check:\n     - y=7 is a border, but y=4 is not.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3, 4) is not listed, so safe.\n   - Moving Down (D) would go to (3, 2). Check:\n     - y=0 is a border, but y=2 is not.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3, 2) is not listed, so safe.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. Let's see where the food is:\n\n1. (4, 2): Value +1, life span 10.\n2. (1, 3): Value +1, life span 10.\n3. (2, 4): Value +1, life span 10.\n\nGiven the snake is at (3, 3), let's see the distances:\n\n1. (4, 2): \n   - Manhattan distance: |4-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - To reach here: First move could be Right (R) but that's opposite to current direction (L), which is not allowed. So, cannot go Right immediately.\n   - Alternative path: Down to (3, 2), then Right to (4, 2). But first move is Down (D).\n2. (1, 3):\n   - Manhattan distance: |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n   - Current direction is Left (L), so continuing Left to (2, 3), then Left again to (1, 3).\n   - First move is Left (L).\n3. (2, 4):\n   - Manhattan distance: |2-3| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - Path: Up to (3, 4), then Left to (2, 4).\n   - First move is Up (U).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven the no reverse rule, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\n1. **Left (L)**:\n   - Move to (2, 3).\n   - Next step could be Left to (1, 3) to eat the food there.\n   - But need to check if (1, 3) is reachable:\n     - From (2, 3), next move can be Left to (1, 3), unless there's an obstacle.\n     - (1, 3) is not listed as an obstacle, so it's reachable.\n   - This path leads directly to food in two moves.\n\n2. **Up (U)**:\n   - Move to (3, 4).\n   - Next step could be Left to (2, 4) to eat the food there.\n   - (2, 4) is food, and no obstacles in the path.\n   - Also leads to food in two moves.\n\n3. **Down (D)**:\n   - Move to (3, 2).\n   - Next step could be Right to (4, 2) to eat the food there.\n   - But next move cannot be Right because current move is Down, and Right is not opposite to Down, so it's allowed.\n   - However, initial direction was Left, and Down is not opposite to Left, so it's allowed.\n   - Leads to food in two moves.\n\nAll three options lead to food in two moves. Now, let's see if any of these moves are risky.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nSince the snake's length is 1, there's no body to collide with. The only risks are walls and obstacles, which we've already checked.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll three options are equally good in terms of reaching food in two moves. However, since the current direction is Left, continuing Left (L) maintains the current direction, which might be simpler.\n\nAlternatively, since all options are safe and lead to food, we can choose any. But perhaps the closest food is at (2, 4) and (1, 3), both two moves away. \n\nBut (1, 3) is directly left, and (2, 4) is up then left. Since Left is the current direction, it might be more straightforward to continue Left.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. But here, the snake's length is 1, so no tail exists. Thus, this rule doesn't apply.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all options are safe and lead to food, and continuing Left is consistent with the current direction, I'll choose Left.\n\nHowever, looking back, the food at (1, 3) is reachable by two Left moves, and the snake is already moving Left. Moving Left now to (2, 3) sets up the next move to (1, 3) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, moving Up now to (3, 4) allows moving Left to (2, 4) next to eat that food.\n\nBoth are equally valid, but since the snake is already moving Left, continuing Left seems more natural.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most straightforward move is to continue Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There are also internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n2. **Snake**: The snake has a single segment at (2, 3), meaning it's just the head right now. The head is currently moving left (L).\n3. **Food**: There are four food items with their positions, life spans, and values:\n   - (4, 2): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (1, 3): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (2, 4): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (6, 5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing the Snake's Current State\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 3), moving left (L). Since it's a single segment, the tail is also at (2, 3). \n\n**Possible Moves**: \n- **Left (L)**: (1, 3)\n- **Up (U)**: (2, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (2, 2)\n\n**Reverse Move Constraint**: The snake cannot move right (R) because it's the opposite of the current direction (L).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n1. **Left (L) to (1, 3)**:\n   - **Check for Walls/Obstacles**: \n     - Border walls: x=0 is a wall. (1, 3) is x=1, y=3, which is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (1, 2), (1, 5). (1, 3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - **Check for Food**: There's a food item at (1, 3).\n     - **Value**: 9 (positive).\n     - **Tail Reward Danger**: Since the snake is only one segment, moving to (1, 3) would mean the head moves to (1, 3), and the tail would also move to (1, 3) because the snake grows. But since the snake is just a single segment, it's a bit unclear. However, the rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n     - **Interpretation**: The tail is at (2, 3), and the head is moving to (1, 3). The tail is adjacent to the head (since (2,3) and (1,3) are adjacent). The tail cell (2,3) doesn't have food, but the head is moving to a cell with food. The rule specifies the tail cell must have food. Since the tail cell (2,3) doesn't have food, this condition doesn't apply. So, it's safe to eat the food at (1,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (2, 4)**:\n   - **Check for Walls/Obstacles**: \n     - y=7 is the upper border. (2,4) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,6) is an obstacle, but (2,4) is not.\n   - **Check for Food**: There's a food item at (2,4).\n     - **Value**: 9 (positive).\n     - **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (2,3), and the head moves to (2,4). The tail is adjacent to the head. The tail cell (2,3) doesn't have food. So, it's safe.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe and beneficial.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (2, 2)**:\n   - **Check for Walls/Obstacles**: \n     - y=0 is the lower border. (2,2) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,1) is an obstacle, but (2,2) is not.\n   - **Check for Food**: No food at (2,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Left (L)**: Eats food at (1,3), gains +1 score, and increases length.\n- **Up (U)**: Eats food at (2,4), gains +1 score, and increases length.\n- **Down (D)**: No immediate reward.\n\n**Decision**: Both L and U offer the same reward. We need to consider future implications.\n\n### Future Implications\n\n- **Left (L)**: After moving to (1,3), the snake's direction is L. Next possible moves would be L (to (0,3) - wall), U (to (1,4)), D (to (1,2)).\n  - L is invalid (wall).\n  - U and D are valid but no immediate food.\n- **Up (U)**: After moving to (2,4), the snake's direction is U. Next possible moves would be U (to (2,5)), L (to (1,4)), R (to (3,4)).\n  - All are valid, but no immediate food.\n\n**Conclusion**: Both options lead to similar future states. Since the snake is length 1, the immediate reward is the same. \n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Food Life Span**: All foods have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear next turn. So, if we don't eat them now, they'll be gone.\n- **Distance to Other Foods**: \n  - (4,2) and (6,5) are further away. \n  - (1,3) and (2,4) are immediate.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both L and U offer immediate rewards and are safe, I can choose either. However, moving left (L) to (1,3) is more consistent with the current direction. \n\nBut, looking at the internal obstacles, moving up (U) to (2,4) might be better because:\n- The next move could be U to (2,5), then R to (3,5), etc., towards (6,5).\n- Moving L to (1,3) might limit future options since (0,3) is a wall.\n\n**However**, the task is to decide the immediate action, not plan ahead. Both options are equally good in terms of immediate reward.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Left (L)**: \n  - New position: (1,3).\n  - Score: +1.\n  - Length: 2.\n- **Up (U)**: \n  - New position: (2,4).\n  - Score: +1.\n  - Length: 2.\n\nBoth are valid. Since the problem states to act as a non-thinking executor, I should choose based on immediate reward. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options are equivalent in terms of immediate reward. I'll choose **Up (U)** because it might offer more flexibility in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal obstacles**: There are five specific cells that are blocked: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake has two segments: head at (2,4) and body at (2,3).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning the last move was from (2,3) to (2,4).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food are present:\n     - (4,2): value = 8, life_span = 1\n     - (1,3): value = 8, life_span = 1\n     - (6,5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - All food has a positive value (+1), so no negative food is present.\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is moving Up (U), the opposite direction is Down (D). So, the snake cannot move Down in the next turn.\n2. **Possible Moves**: The snake can move Up (U), Left (L), or Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move (U, L, R) based on safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U)\n- **New Head Position**: (2,4) → (2,5)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: y=5 is within bounds (0-7), and x=2 is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: (2,5) is not in the list of internal obstacles.\n  - **Body Collision**: The snake's body is at (2,3). The new head position (2,5) doesn't overlap with the body.\n- **Food Check**: No food is at (2,5).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- **New Head Position**: (2,4) → (1,4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: x=1 is within bounds (0-7), y=4 is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: (1,4) is not in the list.\n  - **Body Collision**: The body is at (2,3). No overlap.\n- **Food Check**: No food is at (1,4).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- **New Head Position**: (2,4) → (3,4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: x=3 is within bounds, y=4 is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: (3,4) is not in the list.\n  - **Body Collision**: No overlap.\n- **Food Check**: No food is at (3,4).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Rewards\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, the primary goal is to position the snake to reach food in future turns. Let's analyze the food positions:\n\n1. **(4,2)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 8 (but current turn is t0=2, so it disappears at t=10).\n   - Current distance from head (2,4) to (4,2): Manhattan distance is |4-2| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n   - To reach it, the snake needs to move right and down.\n\n2. **(1,3)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 8 (disappears at t=10).\n   - Distance: |1-2| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - Closest food. To reach it, the snake needs to move left and down.\n\n3. **(6,5)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 9 (disappears at t=11).\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n   - Farthest food.\n\n### Strategy\n\nGiven the distances, the food at (1,3) is the closest. However, the snake is currently moving Up, and to reach (1,3), it needs to move left and then down.\n\nBut, the current turn is t0=2, and the food disappears at t=10. So, we have 8 more turns to reach it.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, the best action is to keep the snake safe and position it towards the nearest food.\n\n1. **Move Left (L)**: Positions the head at (1,4). From there, the next move could be Down to (1,3), reaching the food.\n   - However, we need to ensure that the tail doesn't cause a collision when the snake grows.\n   - The tail is at (2,3). After moving left to (1,4), the tail moves to (2,4).\n   - Next move: Down to (1,3). The snake grows, so the tail stays at (2,4).\n   - The new head is at (1,3), and the body is [(1,4), (2,4)].\n   - No collision.\n\n2. **Move Right (R)**: Positions the head at (3,4). This is a neutral move but doesn't bring us closer to any food immediately.\n\n3. **Move Up (U)**: Positions the head at (2,5). This is neutral but might be useful if we plan to go towards (6,5) later.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe most promising path is towards (1,3). Therefore, the first step is to move Left (L) to (1,4), setting up the next move to be Down (D) to (1,3).\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Current Head**: (2,4), direction U.\n- **Action**: L (Left).\n- **New Head**: (1,4).\n- **Body**: [(1,4), (2,4)].\n- **Tail**: (2,3) moves to (2,4).\n\n**Next Turn**:\n- **Head**: (1,4), direction L.\n- **Possible Moves**: U, D, L (no R, because it's the opposite of L, but the previous move was L, so the opposite would be R, but since the last move was L, the opposite is R, but the snake can't reverse to R).\n   - Actually, the snake's head direction is U, but the last move was L. The rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n   - The current head direction is U, but the last move was L. The rule might refer to the last move's direction.\n   - Clarification needed: Is the \"current direction\" the last move's direction or the head's facing direction?\n   - The input says \"Snake Head Direction: U\". So, the head is facing Up, but the last move was Up (since the snake was at (2,3) and moved to (2,4) with direction U).\n   - But in the current state, the head is at (2,4), last move was U.\n   - If we move L, the new head direction is L.\n   - Then, in the next turn, the opposite of L is R, which is forbidden.\n\nBut in the next turn, if we move D to (1,3), we need to ensure that it's allowed. The opposite of D is U, but the previous move was L, so it's not a direct reversal.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. To simplify, I think the main point is to avoid moving in the exact opposite direction of the last move.\n\n- **Last move**: U (from (2,3) to (2,4)).\n- **Current move**: L (to (1,4)).\n- **Next move**: D (to (1,3)).\n\nThis sequence is valid because:\n- U → L is allowed (not opposite).\n- L → D is allowed (not opposite to L, which would be R).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince moving Left sets up the path to the nearest food and is safe, the best immediate action is to move Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 3\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n3. **Snake Positions**: Head at (1,4), body at (2,4)\n   - So the snake is two segments long: head at (1,4) and tail at (2,4).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (4,2): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (1,3): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (6,5): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Movements\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since it's currently moving Left (L), it cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (1,4)\n- Move left: (0,4)\n   - Check borders: x=0 is a border wall → collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- Current head: (1,4)\n- Move up: (1,5)\n   - Check walls:\n     - Internal obstacle at (1,5) → collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- Current head: (1,4)\n- Move down: (1,3)\n   - Check walls: no walls at (1,3)\n   - Check body:\n     - Body is at (2,4), not (1,3)\n   - Check food:\n     - There's food at (1,3) with value=7, life_span=1\n     - Eating this food:\n       - Value is positive (+7), so length increases by 1.\n       - Check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n         - Current tail is at (2,4), adjacent to head at (1,4) (they are adjacent left).\n         - After eating, new tail will be where the current tail is (since length increases by 1, the tail doesn't move).\n         - New head at (1,3), new body at (1,4), tail at (2,4).\n         - Is head adjacent to new tail? Head at (1,3), tail at (2,4):\n           - Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.\n           - (1,3) and (2,4): x differs by 1, y differs by 1 → diagonal, not adjacent.\n           - So no adjacency between new head and tail.\n       - Therefore, no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - **Valid move**, and it eats positive food.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R)\n- Normally, moving right would be opposite to current left direction, which is not allowed.\n- But let's confirm: current direction is L, next move cannot be R.\n- **Invalid move**.\n\n### Available Valid Moves\n\nFrom above, only **Down (D)** is a valid move that doesn't lead to a collision and allows eating positive food.\n\n### Checking Other Food Options\n\nJust to ensure we're not missing anything, let's see if other food is reachable soon:\n\n- (4,2): Far from current head at (1,4), not immediately reachable.\n- (6,5): Also far from (1,4).\n\nThe food at (1,3) is directly below the head and is the only one we can reach immediately.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in moving Down to (1,3)?\n\n- After move:\n  - Head at (1,3), body at (1,4), tail at (2,4).\n  - Next possible moves from (1,3):\n    - Can't reverse to Up (U) (since we just moved Down).\n    - Left (L): (0,3) → wall at x=0 → invalid.\n    - Right (R): (2,3) → check:\n      - Not a wall.\n      - Not body (body is at (1,4) and (2,4)).\n      - No food there.\n      - Valid.\n    - Down (D): (1,2) → check:\n      - Internal obstacle at (1,2) → invalid.\n    - So next move would likely be Right to (2,3).\n\nNo immediate risks seen in moving Down now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and beneficial move is **Down (D)**, which allows the snake to eat the positive food at (1,3) without causing any collisions or dangers.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn \\( t_0 = 4 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move beyond these coordinates.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions: Head at (1,3), then (1,4), then (2,4). So, the snake is three segments long.\n   - Current head direction: Down (D). This means the last move was downward, so the snake moved from (1,4) to (1,3).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (4,2): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (2,2): value=1, life_span=10\n\nAll foods are positive (+1), and none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (1,3) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (1,4) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so moving here would cause a collision (head touches body immediately). Also, since the current direction is D, moving U would be an instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n- **Down (D)**: (1,2) — let's check this:\n  - (1,2) is an internal obstacle (wall). Cannot move here.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,3) — x=0 is a border wall. Cannot move here.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,3) — let's check this:\n  - Is (2,3) a wall? No, it's not listed in internal obstacles.\n  - Is (2,3) part of the snake's body? The body is at (1,4) and (2,4), so no.\n  - Is there food at (2,3)? No, food is at (4,2), (6,5), (2,2).\n  - So, moving R to (2,3) is safe.\n\nWait a minute, is moving Right (R) the only possible move here? Let me double-check:\n\n- U: instant reverse and body collision — invalid.\n- D: wall — invalid.\n- L: border wall — invalid.\n- R: seems valid.\n\nSo, the only possible move is Right (R) to (2,3).\n\nBut before finalizing, let's check if there's any food adjacent that we should consider, even though we might be forced into a move.\n\n### Checking Adjacent Cells for Food\n\nFrom head at (1,3), adjacent cells are:\n- Up: (1,4) — body segment, no food.\n- Down: (1,2) — wall, no food.\n- Left: (0,3) — wall, no food.\n- Right: (2,3) — no food.\n\nThe foods are at:\n- (4,2): distance from (1,3) is |4-1| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (6,5): distance = |6-1| + |5-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- (2,2): distance = |2-1| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe closest food is at (2,2), which is distance 2 away (Manhattan distance). \n\nCan we move towards (2,2)? Currently at (1,3), to reach (2,2), we'd need to move Right then Down, or Down then Right. But Down is blocked by a wall at (1,2), so only Right then Down is possible.\n\nBut in this turn, we can only make one move, and the only possible move is Right to (2,3). Next turn, from (2,3), we could move Down to (2,2) to get the food, unless something changes.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten? The tail is at (2,4). Is there food at (2,4)? No, foods are at (4,2), (6,5), (2,2). So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Verifying No Other Options\n\nIs there any other consideration? The only possible move is Right (R). Even though it doesn't immediately get us closer to food (from (1,3) to (2,3), distance to (2,2) remains 2), it's the only safe move available.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n- Up: invalid (reverse and collision)\n- Down: invalid (wall)\n- Left: invalid (wall)\n- Right: valid and safe\n\nTherefore, the only possible action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Current Position**: The snake's head is at (2, 3), followed by body segments at (1, 3) and (1, 4).\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Right (R).\n3. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (4, 2): value=1, life_span=5.\n   - (6, 5): value=1, life_span=6.\n   - (2, 2): value=1, life_span=9.\n\n### Objective\nI need to decide the immediate next move (U/D/L/R) for the snake to maximize the score while avoiding collisions with walls, its own body, and considering the food's lifespan.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Possible Moves\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). The possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (2, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (2, 2)\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (1, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (3, 3)\n\nBut, since the snake is moving Right, it cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) because of the \"No instant reverse\" rule.\n\n### Step 2: Check Validity of Each Move\nNow, I need to evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2, 4)\n   - **Wall Check**: No border walls here. Internal obstacles don't include (2,4).\n   - **Body Collision**: The snake's body is at (1,3), (1,4). The new head position (2,4) does not collide with any body segment.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (2, 2)\n   - **Wall Check**: No border walls. Internal obstacles don't include (2,2).\n   - **Body Collision**: The body is at (1,3), (1,4). No collision.\n   - **Food Check**: There's a positive food at (2,2) with value=1.\n     - **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (1,4). The head is moving to (2,2), which is not adjacent to the tail. So, no danger.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid and leads to food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (3, 3)\n   - **Wall Check**: No border walls. No internal obstacles.\n   - **Body Collision**: No collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Food Options\nThere are three food items:\n1. **(4,2)**: 5 turns left.\n2. **(6,5)**: 6 turns left.\n3. **(2,2)**: 9 turns left.\n\nThe Down (D) move leads directly to (2,2), which has a positive food. Since it's the closest and has a long lifespan, it's a good target.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Other Moves\n- **Up (U)**: Doesn't lead to any immediate food but is safe.\n- **Right (R)**: Moves the snake towards the center but doesn't lead to any immediate food.\n\n### Step 5: Check for Immediate Benefits\n- **Down (D)**: Immediate reward of +1 and increases the snake's length.\n- **Up (U) and Right (R)**: No immediate reward.\n\n### Step 6: Safety Considerations\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, as per above checks.\n- **Up (U)**: Safe but no immediate benefit.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Step 7: Future Planning\nSince the AI is a non-thinking executor, it should prioritize immediate rewards based on the current state. The Down (D) move offers an immediate reward and is safe.\n\n### Verification\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (1,4). The new head position (2,2) is not adjacent to the tail (distance is √[(2-1)² + (2-4)²] = √5 ≈ 2.24 > 1). So, no danger.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (2,2).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 6.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are additional walls inside the grid.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (2,2), followed by (2,3), (1,3), (1,4). So, the snake has 4 segments.\n   - **Current Direction**: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (4,2): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (6,5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2) and current direction D (down), the possible moves are U, D, L, R. However, we cannot instantly reverse direction, so moving Up (U) is not allowed (since current direction is D, opposite is U).\n\nSo, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nBut we also need to check if these moves are valid (i.e., not into a wall or snake body).\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (2,1)\n   - Check (2,1):\n     - Walls: Is (2,1) a wall?\n       - Border walls: y=0 is at y=0, so y=1 is not a border wall.\n       - Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6) → (2,1) is not in this list.\n     - Snake body: Snake is at [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] → (2,1) is not in the body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (1,2)\n   - Check (1,2):\n     - Walls: \n       - Internal obstacles: (1,2) is in the list! So it's a wall.\n     - Cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (3,2)\n   - Check (3,2):\n     - Walls:\n       - Not a border wall.\n       - Not in internal obstacles.\n     - Snake body: Not in [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)].\n   - Valid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: D (to (2,1)), R (to (3,2)).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving to these positions can eat food.\n\n1. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Value: 4 (positive)\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - To eat, head must move to (4,2).\n   - Current head is at (2,2). To reach (4,2), need to move right twice: first to (3,2), then to (4,2).\n   - But life span is 1, so next turn it will disappear. Cannot reach it in one move from (2,2).\n   - So, cannot eat (4,2) this turn.\n\n2. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Value: 5 (positive)\n   - Life span: 1\n   - Current head at (2,2). Distance is |6-2| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7 steps away.\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n   - So, cannot eat (6,5) this turn.\n\nNo food can be eaten this turn directly.\n\n### Checking for Future Food Access\n\nEven though we can't eat food this turn, moving in a direction that might help reach food next turns is good.\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,2):\n  - Next turn, from (3,2), possible moves: \n    - From (3,2), direction would be R (if we moved R now).\n    - Cannot reverse to L.\n    - Possible moves: U, D, R.\n    - Could then move R to (4,2), but food at (4,2) will be gone by then.\n    - Not directly helpful for current food.\n\n- Moving Down (D) to (2,1):\n  - From (2,1), next moves:\n    - Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n    - Possible: D, L, R.\n    - Moving D to (2,0): y=0 is wall. Invalid.\n    - Moving L to (1,1):\n      - Check (1,1): not a wall, not in snake body (snake is at [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)] after move D).\n      - Then from (1,1), can explore more.\n    - Moving R to (3,1):\n      - Similarly, can explore.\n  - Not directly leading to food, but keeps options open.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules:\n- If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n- Current snake positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)].\n  - Tail is at (1,4).\n  - Adjacent to head (2,2): cells are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n    - (2,3) is body, not tail.\n    - (1,2) is wall.\n    - (3,2) and (2,1) are possible moves.\n    - Tail is at (1,4), which is not adjacent to head (distance is |1-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3).\n  - So, no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions\n\nFor the valid moves:\n1. D to (2,1):\n   - Not a wall, not body.\n2. R to (3,2):\n   - Not a wall, not body.\n\nBoth are safe.\n\n### Deciding Between D and R\n\nBoth moves are safe, neither leads directly to food this turn. \n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving R to (3,2) is moving towards the center.\n- Moving D to (2,1) is moving towards the bottom border (y=0 is wall at y=0, so y=1 is one above).\n\nPerhaps moving R is better as it keeps more options open for future moves, whereas moving D is getting closer to the bottom wall.\n\nAlternatively, let's see possible paths:\n- After R to (3,2), next moves could be U to (3,3), D to (3,1), or R to (4,2) (but food at (4,2) will be gone).\n- After D to (2,1), next moves could be L to (1,1), R to (3,1), or D to (2,0) (invalid).\n\nNeither seems significantly better, but moving R seems slightly more central.\n\nAlternatively, is there any food that might appear or is there a strategic reason to prefer one over the other?\n\nGiven that both foods will disappear after this turn, and no immediate gain, either move is fine. Maybe prefer moving away from walls, so R is better than D (since D is towards y=0 wall).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween D and R, R seems slightly better as it moves towards the center and away from walls. \n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body:\n- Current body: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)].\n- Moving R to (3,2) leaves the body to move from (2,3) to (2,2), etc., no immediate collision.\n- Moving D to (2,1) also safe.\n\nGiven that, and no immediate food benefit, let's choose R to keep more space open.\n\nBut wait, moving R to (3,2): next turn, from (3,2), possible moves are U, D, R (since came from L, cannot reverse to L).\n- U to (3,3): open.\n- D to (3,1): open.\n- R to (4,2): but food at (4,2) will be gone.\n\nMoving D to (2,1): next turn, from (2,1), possible moves are L to (1,1), R to (3,1), D to (2,0) (invalid).\n- L to (1,1): then can go U to (1,2) (wall), R to (2,1) (body), D to (1,0) (wall). Not great.\n- R to (3,1): then can go U to (3,2), D to (3,0) (wall\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

Move Down (D) to (2,0)\n- New head position: (2,0)\n- Check for walls: y=0 is a border wall → collision with wall → death.\n- **Outcome:** Deadly. Cannot move Down.\n\n#### 2.

No.\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new body would be:\n  - Head: (1,1)\n  - Body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) [tail moves away from (1,3)]\n- **Outcome:** Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3.

No.\n- After moving, new body:\n  - Head: (3,1)\n  - Body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n- **Outcome:** Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go for in the next moves.\n\n**Food at (4,2):**\n- Distance from head (2,1):\n  - Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n  - Life span: 3 turns\n  - To reach (4,2) in 3 moves:\n    - One possible path: Right to (3,1), then Right to (4,1), then Up to (4,2)\n    - But life span is 3, and countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n      - At t=7: life_span=3\n      - t=8: life_span=2\n      - t=9: life_span=1\n      - t=10: disappears\n    - So, can reach by t=9 (life_span=1), which is possible.\n    - But current turn is t=7, so need to decide immediate action to start moving towards it.\n\n**Food at (6,5):**\n- Distance from head (2,1):\n  - |6-2| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n  - Life span: 4\n  - Cannot reach in time (needs at least 8 moves, but disappears in 4 turns).\n\n**Food at (6,2):**\n- Distance from head (2,1):\n  - |6-2| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\n  - Life span: 10\n  - Can reach in time, but not immediately relevant for current move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if moving in a certain direction could lead to the head being adjacent to the tail where the tail has positive food.

No food listed there.\n  - Valid move.\n\n- **Down (D)**: (3,1) → (3,0)\n  - y=0 is a border wall → Collision with wall. Invalid.\n\n- **Left (L)**: (3,1) → (2,1)\n  - Current direction is R, opposite is L. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n  - So, cannot move Left. Invalid.\n\n- **Right (R)**: (3,1) → (4,1)\n  - Check collisions:\n    - Walls: x=4 is within 0-7, y=1 is within 0-7. No border walls.\n    - Internal obstacles: (4,1) is in the internal obstacles list → Collision. Invalid.\n\nSo, from immediate checks, only **Up (U)** is a valid move.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up leads us to food or is there a better strategic move considering food.\n\nCurrent valid move: Up to (3,2).\n\nIs there food at (3,2)? No.\n\nOther food positions:\n- (4,2): value=1, life=2\n- (6,5): value=1, life=3\n- (6,2): value=1, life=9\n\nFrom (3,1), moving Up to (3,2) doesn't get us food immediately, but it positions us closer to (4,2). Next move from (3,2) could be Right to (4,2) to eat the food there.\n\nAlternative is to see if other moves could be valid if we consider that the tail moves. But currently, only Up is valid.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if moving to any cell adjacent to the tail could lead to eating positive food at the tail, which is dangerous.\n\nTail is at (2,3). Adjacent to tail are:\n- (1,3), (3,3), (2,4), (2,2)\n\nOur possible move is to (3,2), which is not adjacent to tail (distance is sqrt((3-2)^2 + (2-3)^2) = sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2) > 1). So no adjacency.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nIs there any other path? Only Up is valid now. Maybe in future turns we can plan to reach other foods.\n\n### Verifying No Other Valid Moves\n\nJust to be sure, let's recheck other moves:\n\n- Down: to (3,0) → y=0 is wall. Invalid.\n- Left: to (2,1) → opposite direction. Invalid.\n- Right: to (4,1) → internal obstacle. Invalid.\n\nOnly Up is valid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move at this turn is **Up (U)**. \n\n\\boxed{U}",

W . . W . .\ny=5 | . W . . . . . .\ny=4 | . . . . . . . .\ny=3 | . . . . . . . .\ny=2 | . W S . F . . F\ny=1 | . S S W . . . .\ny=0 | . . . . . . . .\n     ---------------\n     x=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n- 'W' = Wall\n- 'S' = Snake (H for head, but here all are 'S' for simplicity; head is first in list)\n- 'F' = Food\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (3,2) to (3,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body segments are at (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). (3,3) is not in this list.\n   - Food: No food at (3,3).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (3,2) to (2,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Tail is at (2,2), but the tail will move forward if the snake moves, so this is safe unless the tail has food (see Tail Reward Danger).\n   - Food: No food at (2,2).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (3,2) to (4,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (4,2) is not in snake body.\n   - Food: There is food at (4,2) with value=1.\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (2,2). Is (2,2) adjacent to head (3,2)? Yes, they are adjacent (left of head). Does (2,2) have positive food? No, there's no food listed at (2,2).\n     - So, no Tail Reward Danger here.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, eat positive food (+1), length increases by 1.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nLet's look at the food options:\n\n1. (4,2): value=1, life_span=1\n   - Can be eaten by moving Right.\n   - After this turn, its life_span decreases to 0 and disappears.\n   - So, if we don't eat it now, it's gone next turn.\n2. (6,5): value=2, life_span=1\n   - Too far to reach in one move.\n3. (6,2): value=8, life_span=1\n   - Also too far to reach in one move.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the immediate options:\n\n- **Right (R)**: Eat (4,2) for +1 score and length increase.\n  - Safe, no immediate dangers.\n- **Up (U)**: Safe but no immediate benefit.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe but no immediate benefit.\n\nThe most beneficial immediate action is to move Right to eat the food at (4,2).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving Right to (4,2):\n\n- New snake positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] (tail at (2,1) drops off if no growth, but since we eat food, length increases by 1, so tail stays at (2,2)).\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nOriginal length: 4 segments.\nEating food: length becomes 5.\nNew positions: head at (4,2), then previous head (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), and tail was (2,2) which now becomes the new tail (since we add one segment at head and the tail doesn't move off).\n\nWait, no: when snake moves and eats, the tail doesn't drop off. So new positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)].\n\nNow, check for collisions in next possible moves:\n\nNext head position options from (4,2): U, D, L, R (current direction is R, but since we're changing direction, all but opposite (L) are allowed unless constrained).\n\nBut we don't need to plan ahead, just ensure current move is safe, which it is.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nOriginal concern: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating is dangerous.\n\nIn current state before move:\n\n- Head at (3,2), tail at (2,2).\n- Adjacent: yes (left).\n- Does (2,2) have food? No.\nSo no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head at (4,2), tail at (2,2).\n- Not adjacent (distance is 2 in x, 0 in y, so not adjacent).\nSo no issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right to eat the positive food at (4,2), which is safe and maximizes the score.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

These are additional walls inside the grid.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (4,2), followed by body segments at (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). So, the snake is 5 units long.\n   - **Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (6,2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (5,4): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food locations:\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head: (4,2)\n  - Body: (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n  \n  Drawing this:\n  \n  - At y=2: x=2 (tail), x=3, x=4 (head)\n  - At y=1: x=2, x=3\n  - So, the snake is making a sort of \"S\" shape.\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,5): Near the top-right, will disappear next turn (life_span=1).\n  - (6,2): Same row as head, to the far right.\n  - (5,4): Above and to the right of the head.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). The possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), but:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Left (opposite of Right) next. So, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**:\n   - Current head: (4,2)\n   - Move right: (5,2)\n   - Check:\n     - Is (5,2) a wall? No walls at (5,2).\n     - Is (5,2) in snake body? Snake body: (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). No.\n     - Is there food at (5,2)? No food there.\n     - So, safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Up (U)**:\n   - Move up: (4,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Wall? No walls at (4,3).\n     - Snake body? No body at (4,3).\n     - Food? No food at (4,3).\n     - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**:\n   - Move down: (4,1)\n   - Check:\n     - Wall? Internal obstacle at (4,1). So, cannot move here.\n     - So, invalid move.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: R, U.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Life_span=1, so will disappear after this turn.\n   - Distance from head (4,2) to (6,5): need to move right twice and up three times. Cannot reach in one move.\n   - So, cannot eat this now.\n\n2. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Same row as head (y=2), at x=6.\n   - Current head at x=4, so need to move right twice to reach.\n   - Life_span=7, so plenty of time.\n   - If we move right now to (5,2), next move could be right to (6,2) to eat it.\n   - But need to check if eating (6,2) is safe:\n     - After eating, snake grows by 1, so new tail is where the current tail is (2,2).\n     - Next head position after eating would be (6,2), body extends to (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n     - Is (6,2) adjacent to tail? Tail is at (2,2), distance is 4 in x-direction, not adjacent.\n     - So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n3. **Food at (5,4)**:\n   - At (5,4), life_span=10.\n   - From (4,2), need to move right to (5,2), then up to (5,3), then up to (5,4) to eat.\n   - Or move up now to (4,3), then right to (5,3), then up to (5,4).\n   - Either way, takes at least 3 moves, but life_span is long.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nBetween R and U:\n\n- **Move Right (R)**:\n  - Moves towards (6,2) food, which is valuable and has long life.\n  - Next move can be right again to eat it.\n  - Safe path, no immediate danger.\n\n- **Move Up (U)**:\n  - Moves away from immediate food.\n  - Could be a strategy to explore other areas, but currently no food in that direction.\n  - Not immediately beneficial.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,5) is about to disappear, but we can't reach it in one move, so no point chasing it.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving right?\n\n- Next head position: (5,2)\n- Adjacent cells to (5,2):\n  - (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2)\n  - (4,2) is the current head's position, which will become the next body segment.\n  - Other cells: no walls or body segments adjacent unless the snake moves in a way that causes collision next turn, but not immediately.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nIf we move right to (5,2):\n\n- Next turn, head at (5,2), direction R.\n- Can then move right to (6,2) to eat the food there.\n- After eating, snake grows, new tail is (2,2), head at (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n- Then, can consider next moves based on remaining food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) towards the food at (6,2), which is safe and maximizes the chance to eat positive food soon.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(6,2) is not in these, so no body collision.\n   - Food at (6,2):\n     - It's positive (value=7), life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n     - Eating it: head moves to (6,2), body grows by 1, so new tail is added where the current tail is (but since length increases, the tail doesn't move away yet).\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: \n       - Current tail is at (2,1). Is (6,2) adjacent to (2,1)? \n       - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n       - (6,2) and (2,1): x diff is 4, y diff is 1. Not adjacent (must have one diff as 1 and other 0).\n       - So no danger.\n   - So moving R to eat (6,2) is safe and gains +7.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (5,3)**:\n   - New head position: (5,3)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is border, y=3 is fine.\n     - Body: (5,3) not in body segments.\n   - Food: No food at (5,3).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (5,1)**:\n   - New head position: (5,1)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is border, y=1 is fine.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,1) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (5,1), which is not listed as an obstacle.\n     - Body: (5,1) is not in body segments.\n   - Food: No food at (5,1).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **R (Right)**: Eat (6,2) for +7, safe.\n- **U (Up)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **D (Down)**: Safe, no reward.\n\nThe best immediate reward is to move Right and eat the food at (6,2) for +7.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to eat the food at (6,2)?\n- Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n- No immediate danger from eating it (no tail collision risk).\n- The other food at (5,4) is also life_span=1, but it's farther and we can't reach it this turn anyway.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Eating (6,2)\n\nAfter moving R to (6,2), the snake will be:\n- Head: (6,2)\n- Body: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] (length increased by 1)\n- Direction: R\n\nNext possible moves from (6,2):\n- Can't go R (x=7 is wall)\n- Can go U to (6,3) or D to (6,1)\n  \nBut since we're only deciding the current move, this is just for context.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is R.

These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (6,2), followed by body segments at (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one piece of food at (5,4) with a value of +1 and a life span of 8 turns (countdown starts at 8).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (6,2)\n  - Body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\n- Food: (5,4)\n\nThe grid is 8x8, with walls at the borders and the specified internal obstacles.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (6,3)\n2. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (6,1)\n3. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (5,2)\n   - But the snake is moving Right, so Left is the opposite direction, which is not allowed unless the snake wasn't moving before, but here it's moving Right, so Left is invalid.\n4. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (7,2)\n   - x=7 is a border wall, so moving Right would hit the wall → invalid.\n\nSo, from the current direction (R), the valid immediate moves are Up (U) and Down (D). Left is opposite and Right is into a wall.\n\n### Evaluating Up (U) to (6,3)\n\n- New head position: (6,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (6,3) is not a wall (x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=3 is not 0 or 7), and it's not in the internal obstacles list.\n  - Body: The body segments are at (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). (6,3) is not in this list.\n- Food: (5,4) is the food. (6,3) is not (5,4), so no food eaten.\n- Next moves: After moving Up, the direction is now Up, so next turn can't be Down (opposite).\n\nThis seems safe, but let's check if moving Up gets us closer to the food or if there's a better immediate move.\n\n### Evaluating Down (D) to (6,1)\n\n- New head position: (6,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=1 is not 0 or 7, x=6 is not 0 or 7, and (6,1) is not in internal obstacles.\n  - Body: Body segments are at (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). (6,1) is not in this list.\n- Food: (5,4) is not at (6,1), so no food eaten.\n- Next moves: After moving Down, direction is Down, so next turn can't be Up.\n\nThis also seems safe. Now, which is better, Up or Down?\n\n### Path to the Food\n\nThe food is at (5,4). Current head is at (6,2). \n\n- Distance to food:\n  - Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- Moving Up to (6,3):\n  - New distance: |6-5| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 (closer).\n- Moving Down to (6,1):\n  - New distance: |6-5| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 (farther).\n\nSo, moving Up gets us closer to the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there food adjacent to the current head that we can eat immediately?\n\nCurrent head: (6,2)\nAdjacent cells:\n- Up: (6,3) - no food.\n- Down: (6,1) - no food.\n- Left: (5,2) - body segment, but has food under it?\n   - Food is at (5,4), not (5,2), so no.\n- Right: (7,2) - wall.\n\nNo immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there a scenario where moving towards the food could lead to the head being adjacent to the tail with positive food under the tail?\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,1). The food is at (5,4), which is not under the tail. So no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Future Moves After Up\n\nIf we move Up to (6,3), next turn we can't move Down. Possible moves from (6,3):\n\n- Left: (5,3)\n- Right: (7,3) - wall.\n- Up: (6,4)\n\nFrom (6,3), moving Left to (5,3) would be towards the food (5,4), then next move could be Up to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path:\n1. Turn 12: Up to (6,3)\n2. Turn 13: Left to (5,3)\n3. Turn 14: Up to (5,4) - eat food.\n\n### Checking for Obstacles in Path\n\n- From (6,3) to (5,3): no walls or body segments (current body will have moved by then).\n- From (5,3) to (5,4): no walls or body segments.\n\n### Alternative: Moving Down\n\nIf we move Down to (6,1), we're moving away from the food, which doesn't seem optimal unless there's a longer-term plan, but currently, the food is at (5,4) with a life span of 8, so we have time to reach it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Up gets us closer to the food without any immediate dangers and sets up a path to reach the food in two more moves. Moving Down takes us away from the food without any clear benefit.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Up**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake cannot move beyond these coordinates).\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail: [(6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1)].\n     - Head: (6,3)\n     - Next segment: (6,2)\n     - Then: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1) (tail)\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake's head is facing \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - (5,4): value = 1, life_span = 7\n     - (3,5): value = 1, life_span = 10\n   - Both are positive food (value = +1), increasing length by 1 when eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,3) facing \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (6,4) - This is the current direction; reversing is not allowed unless we're changing direction.\n- **Left (L)**: (5,3)\n- **Right (R)**: (7,3) - But x=7 is a border wall, so invalid.\n  \nCannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (\"U\"), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are:\n1. Continue Up (U) to (6,4)\n2. Turn Left (L) to (5,3)\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (6,4)**\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (6,4) is not a wall (not in internal obstacles, and y=4 is within bounds).\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1). (6,4) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- Food at (6,4)? No food is listed at (6,4).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (5,3)**\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (5,3) is not in the body segments [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1)].\n- Food at (5,3)? No food is listed at (5,3).\n  \nThis move is also safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, the foods are at:\n- (5,4): To reach this, from (6,3), possible paths:\n  - Up to (6,4), then Left to (5,4) - but next move can't be Left after Up (since current direction is Up, next move can't be opposite, but Left is not opposite to Up, so allowed).\n  - Left to (5,3), then Up to (5,4) - this seems straightforward.\n  \n- (3,5): From (6,3), this is farther away, requiring multiple moves.\n\nGiven that both foods are positive and have sufficient life spans (7 and 10), and we're at turn 13, they'll disappear at turns 20 and 23 respectively. So, we have time to reach them.\n\n### Planning Path to Food\n\nLet's aim for the closer food at (5,4):\n\nCurrent head: (6,3), direction: U.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (5,3), then Up to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\n- Move Left (L) to (5,3):\n  - New head: (5,3)\n  - Body becomes: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] (tail (3,1) is removed as length doesn't increase).\n  \nNext move would be Up (U) to (5,4):\n  - Check if (5,4) is food: Yes, it's (5,4,7,1).\n  - Check if eating is safe:\n    - After eating, length increases by 1, so new tail is the old tail (3,2).\n    - New body: [(5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n    - Is head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,2), head at (5,4): distance is |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent is distance 1).\n    - So, no immediate collision after eating.\n  \nThis seems safe and achieves eating the food.\n\nOption 2: Move Up to (6,4), then Left to (5,4):\n- Move Up (U) to (6,4):\n  - New head: (6,4)\n  - Body: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n  \nNext move Left (L) to (5,4):\n  - Is Left allowed after Up? Yes, since Left is not opposite to Up.\n  - (5,4) is food.\n  - After eating, new body: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n  - Tail is at (3,2), head at (5,4): distance is 2 + 2 = 4, safe.\n  \nThis is also a valid path to the food.\n\n### Choosing Between Options\n\nBoth sequences lead to eating the food safely. Which is better?\n\n- Moving Left first (to (5,3)) then Up to (5,4):\n  - After first move, head is at (5,3), next to food at (5,4).\n  \n- Moving Up first (to (6,4)) then Left to (5,4):\n  - After first move, head is at (6,4), next to food at (5,4).\n\nBoth are equally good in terms of steps to food. However, moving Left first might be slightly better because:\n\n- After moving Left to (5,3), the next move Up to (5,4) is straightforward.\n- Moving Up first to (6,4) leaves the option to go Left to (5,4) or potentially other directions next, but since we're aiming for (5,4), Left is the immediate next move.\n\nGiven that, moving Left first seems more direct towards the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs moving Left to (5,3) safe in terms of future moves?\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), the body is:\n[(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nNext move is Up to (5,4):\n- (5,4) is not part of the body, not a wall, and is food.\n\nAfter eating, new body is:\n[(5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nThen, possible next moves from (5,4):\n- Current direction is Up (from (5,3) to (5,4)).\n- Possible moves:\n  - Continue Up to (5,5): check if safe.\n    - (5,5): not a wall, not in body (body is [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]), no food.\n  - Left to (4,4): \n    - (4,4): not a wall, not in body.\n  - Right to (6,4): \n    - (6,4): is part of the body (from [(5,3), (6,3), ...], no, (6,4) is not in the body yet. Wait, body is [(5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)], so (6,4) is not in body, safe.\n  \nSo, future moves seem safe.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Other Food\n\nThe other food is at (3,5), which is farther. To reach it:\n\nFrom (6,3):\n- Left to (5,3), then Up to (5,4), then Left to (4,4), then Up to\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are five internal walls at positions (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), and (2,6). These are also impassable.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n     - Head is at (6,4).\n     - Tail is at (3,2).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning its last move was upwards.\n4. **Food**:\n   - Two pieces of food are present:\n     - (5,4): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     - (3,5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is moving Up (\"U\"), it cannot move Down (\"D\") in the next turn.\n- **Possible Moves**: From the current head position (6,4), the possible moves are:\n  - Up (U): (6,5)\n  - Left (L): (5,4)\n  - Right (R): (7,4)\n\nDown is invalid due to the no-reverse rule.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6,5)**:\n   - Check for walls:\n     - (6,5) is within borders (x=6 is valid, y=5 is within 0-7).\n     - No internal walls at (6,5).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - The snake's body segments are at (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). (6,5) is not in this list.\n   - Food at (6,5)? No, the food is at (5,4) and (3,5).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check for walls:\n     - (5,4) is within borders.\n     - No internal walls at (5,4).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (5,4) is not in the body segments list.\n   - Food at (5,4)? Yes, there's food here with value=6, life_span=1.\n     - Check if it's safe to eat:\n       - The food is under the snake's body? Let's see:\n         - The snake's body is at (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc. (5,4) is not under the body; it's adjacent to the head.\n       - Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is the tail cell (3,2) a positive food?\n         - Tail is at (3,2). Distance from head (6,4) to tail (3,2) is |6-3| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent means distance=1).\n         - So, no tail reward danger.\n     - Eating this food is safe and beneficial.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, eat positive food (+6 score, length increases by 1).\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (7,4)**:\n   - Check for walls:\n     - x=7 is a border wall.\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid move, would hit the wall.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nBetween the two valid moves (U and L):\n\n- **Move U (6,5)**:\n  - No immediate reward.\n  - Safe, but doesn't contribute to the score.\n  \n- **Move L (5,4)**:\n  - Eats positive food (+6 score, length +1).\n  - Safe, no immediate dangers.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, moving Left to (5,4) is the better choice.\n\n### Checking for Potential Dangers After Move L\n\nAfter moving to (5,4) and eating the food:\n\n- New snake positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] (length increases by 1).\n- Next turn's possible moves from (5,4):\n  - Current direction is L (since we moved L from U).\n  - Cannot move R (no reverse).\n  - Possible: U, D, L.\n  \nBut since we're only deciding for the current turn, this is just for thoroughness.\n\n### Verifying Food Life Span\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So, the food at (5,4) will be gone next turn if not eaten now. This makes eating it now more urgent.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all the above, the best immediate action is to move Left to eat the positive food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n2. **Wall Collisions**: \n   - Moving Left (L) from (5,4) would go to (4,4). Is (4,4) a wall? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles don't include (4,4).\n   - Moving Up (U) from (5,4) would go to (5,5). Is (5,5) a wall? No.\n   - Moving Down (D) from (5,4) would go to (5,3). Is (5,3) a wall? No.\n3. **Body Collisions**:\n   - Current body segments: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n   - Moving Left to (4,4): Not in body.\n   - Moving Up to (5,5): Not in body.\n   - Moving Down to (5,3): Not in body.\n   - So, no immediate body collisions for U, D, L.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nThere's one positive food at (3,5):\n\n- Distance from head (5,4) to food (3,5):\n  - Manhattan distance: |5-3| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n- To reach (3,5), possible paths:\n  - One way: Up to (5,5), then Left to (4,5), then Left to (3,5).\n  - Another: Left to (4,4), then Up to (4,5), then Left to (3,5).\n  - Or other combinations.\n\nBut we're only deciding the immediate next move at t=15.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move (U, D, L):\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n   - Next to food: (5,5) is adjacent to (5,4) and (5,6), but food is at (3,5), so not directly closer in Manhattan distance.\n   - Future path: From (5,5), can then go Left to (4,5), then Left to (3,5) to eat food.\n   - No immediate collision.\n   - Doesn't immediately help in eating food but sets up a path.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (5,3)**:\n   - Moves away from food (food is at y=5, moving to y=3).\n   - Not helpful for reaching food.\n   - No immediate collision.\n\n3. **Move Left (L) to (4,4)**:\n   - Moves towards the x-coordinate of food (food is at x=3, moving from x=5 to x=4).\n   - From (4,4), next move could be Up to (4,5), then Left to (3,5) to eat food.\n   - No immediate collision.\n   - Directly moves towards the food's x-coordinate.\n\nBetween U and L, both can lead to the food in two more moves, but L directly reduces the x-distance to the food, which seems more straightforward.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- Tail is at (3,2). \n- Current head is at (5,4). Distance to tail: |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nFood at (3,5) has life span 8. After this move (t=15), it will have 7 left. Plenty of time to reach it in a few moves.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Initial Choice\n\nIf we choose L to (4,4):\n\n- Next move could be U to (4,5), then L to (3,5) to eat food.\n- Or other sequences, but this seems efficient.\n\nIf we choose U to (5,5):\n\n- Next move could be L to (4,5), then L to (3,5).\n- Also efficient, but initial move doesn't reduce x-distance.\n\n### Deciding the Best Immediate Move\n\nGiven that moving Left (L) directly reduces the x-distance to the food and sets up a clear path to reach it in two more moves, this seems optimal.\n\nMoving Up (U) also sets up a path but doesn't directly reduce the x-distance initially.\n\nMoving Down (D) moves away from the food, so not optimal.\n\n### Verifying for Immediate Dangers\n\n- Moving Left to (4,4):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not a body segment.\n  - Not adjacent to tail with food.\n- All safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (4,4), setting up a path to reach the food at (3,5) efficiently.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Up (U) - (4,5)\n- New head position: (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top wall, y=5 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,6) is above (4,5), but (4,5) itself is not an obstacle.\n  - Body segments: Check if (4,5) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — (4,5) is not here.\n  - So, no collision.\n- Food at (4,5)? No food listed there.\n- Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) - (4,3)\n- New head position: (4,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is bottom, y=3 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,1) is below, but (4,3) is clear.\n  - Body segments: (4,3) is not in the current body.\n- Food at (4,3)? No food listed there.\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L) - (3,4)\n- New head position: (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left, x=3 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: None at (3,4).\n  - Body segments: (3,4) is not in the current body.\n- Food at (3,4)? No, but there's food at (3,5) which is above (3,4).\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### Additional Consideration: Food at (6,3)\nThe food at (6,3) is currently under the snake's body segment (6,3). To eat this:\n- The body must move away from (6,3), and then the head must move onto it.\n- Currently, the body segment at (6,3) will move to (6,2) next turn (since the tail is at (4,2) and the body moves forward).\n- So, to eat (6,3), we'd need to maneuver the head to (6,3) after the body moves away.\n- However, the life_span of (6,3) is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So we cannot eat it next turn; it must be eaten now if possible.\n- But currently, the head is at (4,4), and (6,3) is two moves away (e.g., Down then Left), so we can't reach it in one move.\n- Hence, we cannot eat (6,3) this turn; it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,5) has life_span 1, so it will disappear after this turn unless eaten now.\n- To eat (3,5), we'd need to move to (3,5) now.\n- From (4,4), possible moves to reach (3,5):\n  - Up to (4,5), then Left to (3,5) — but that's two moves.\n  - Left to (3,4), then Up to (3,5) — again two moves.\n- So cannot eat (3,5) in one move; it will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nGiven that both food items will disappear after this turn and cannot be eaten immediately, our priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future food collection.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\n- **Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (4,5): U (to (4,6)), but (4,6) is an obstacle. So U is not possible next.\n    - Wait, (4,6) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n    - So from (4,5), possible next moves: D (reverse, not allowed), L, R.\n    - L to (3,5) — but no food there now.\n    - R to (5,5) — no info on food there.\n  - Not immediately beneficial.\n\n- **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (4,3): U (reverse, not allowed), D, L, R.\n    - D to (4,2) — but (4,2) is the tail. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n      - Is there positive food at the tail? Tail is at (4,2), no food listed there.\n      - So moving to (4,2) is safe.\n    - L to (3,3) — no info.\n    - R to (5,3) — no info.\n  - Moving D now allows D next turn to (4,2), which is safe.\n\n- **Left (L) to (3,4)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (3,4): R (reverse, not allowed), U, D, L.\n    - U to (3,5) — no food there now.\n    - D to (3,3) — no info.\n    - L to (2,4) — no info.\n  - Not immediately beneficial.\n\nBetween U, D, L, moving Down seems the most promising because it allows us to potentially move Down again to the tail safely, keeping options open.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nWait, let's double-check if any food is adjacent to the head that can be eaten now:\n\n- Head at (4,4).\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - (4,5) — no food.\n  - (4,3) — no food.\n  - (3,4) — no food.\n  - (5,4) — body segment, cannot go there.\n\nNo adjacent food to eat immediately.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nWe should also consider the snake's body to avoid trapping ourselves. Currently, the body is:\n\n(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nMoving Down to (4,3) is safe, and then next turn we can move Down to (4,2), where the tail is currently at (4,2), but the tail will have moved to (5,2) by then, so (4,2) will be empty.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Down (D)** seems the safest and most flexible choice, as it doesn't lead to immediate dead-ends and keeps the snake's movement options open for future turns.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 17  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (4,3)\n- Body segments in order: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down, which is decreasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (3,5) - life span: 6, value: 1 (positive)\n2. (6,3) - life span: 9, value: 1 (positive)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position on the grid to better understand possible moves.\n\nThe snake's body is:\n- Head: (4,3)\n- Next: (4,4) - directly above the head (since head is moving Down, this is the neck)\n- Then: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)\n\nSo the snake is kind of making a \"U\" shape from (4,3) up to (4,4), right to (6,4), down to (6,2), and then left to (5,2).\n\nFood is at:\n- (3,5) - to the left and up from the head\n- (6,3) - to the right and same y as the head, but (6,3) is already occupied by the snake's body (the 4th segment after the head)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Down (D). The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but:\n- Cannot instantly reverse direction, so cannot go Up (U) because current direction is Down.\n- So possible moves: D, L, R\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) - (4,2)\n\n- New head position: (4,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body segments: The body after moving will be [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)] minus the tail (assuming tail moves forward), but the new head is (4,2), which is not in the current body except the tail is at (5,2), which is not (4,2). So no body collision.\n- Food at (4,2)? No food listed there.\n- So moving Down is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (3,3)\n\n- New head position: (3,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so (3,3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6) - none at (3,3).\n  - Body segments: Current body is [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]. (3,3) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- Food at (3,3)? No, food is at (3,5) and (6,3).\n- So moving Left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (5,3)\n\n- New head position: (5,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is at x=7, so (5,3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: none at (5,3).\n  - Body segments: Current body has (5,4) and (5,2), but not (5,3), so no collision.\n- Food at (5,3)? No, food is at (3,5) and (6,3).\n- So moving Right is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten in the next moves.\n\n**Food at (6,3)**:\n- Currently, (6,3) is occupied by the snake's body (4th segment).\n- To eat this, the body must move away, and then the head must move onto it.\n- Currently, the segment after (6,3) is (6,2), so the tail is at (5,2). The tail will move forward next turn, but (6,3) is not the tail, so it won't move away immediately.\n- So cannot eat (6,3) right now.\n\n**Food at (3,5)**:\n- It's at (3,5), which is two steps left and two steps up from the head (4,3).\n- To reach it, we'd need to move towards it, but currently moving left is safe but doesn't get us closer in one move.\n- Maybe plan a path to reach it in future turns.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail having positive food:\n- If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the newly grown tail will collide with the head.\n- Current tail is at (5,2). Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2)\n- Head is at (4,3), which is adjacent to (5,2) via (5,2) is one step right and one step down from (4,3), but actually, distance is |4-5| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2, so not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1: up, down, left, right).\nWait, let's clarify adjacency:\nAdjacent means sharing a side (not diagonal), so for (5,2), adjacent are:\n- (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2)\nHead is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (5,2) (distance is 2). So no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe but don't eat food immediately. So we need to choose the one that sets us up best for future food collection.\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (3,5): to reach it, moving left is better.\n- (6,3): currently blocked by body, but moving right might help in future.\n\nBetween left and right, moving left seems better because (3,5) is closer in terms of steps needed (need to go left and up), and moving right doesn't immediately help with (6,3) since it's blocked.\n\nMoving down is safe but doesn't help in approaching either food.\n\nSo, between left and right, left seems slightly better to approach (3,5).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food After Move\n\nIf we move left to (3,3), next turn we could move up to (3,4), then (3,5) to eat the food, provided nothing changes.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,3), then maybe up to (5,4), but that's already part of the body, so not helpful.\n\nMoving down to (4,2), then maybe left to (3,2), then up to (3,3), etc., which is longer to reach (3,5).\n\nThus, moving left seems the best to position for (3,5).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Left Move\n\nAfter moving left to (3,3), next possible moves would be U, D, L (cannot go R because that would be opposite of L, but current direction is D, so next direction can be anything except U? Wait, no, the \"no instant reverse\" rule is about not doing the opposite of the last move. Last move was D, so cannot go U next. But now we're moving L, so next turn cannot go R.\n\nBut for now, we're deciding current move, which is safe to go L.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Left (L)** seems the most strategic to position the snake towards the positive food at (3,5) without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 18  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]  \nThis means:\n- Head at (3, 3)\n- Body segments at (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n- Tail at (6,2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nSo, the snake was moving left to reach (3,3) from its previous position (which must have been to the right, but since the direction is L, it's consistent).\n\n**Food**:\n1.

(6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (3,3), moving in direction L (left), the possible next moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left). We cannot move R (Right) because that would be an instant reverse (opposite of current direction L).\n\nSo, possible actions: U, D, L\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L): to (2,3)\n- Check for walls: \n  - x=2, y=3: Not a border wall (x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7 are borders), and not in internal obstacles list.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body positions: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n  - (2,3) is not in these, so no collision.\n- Food at (2,3)? No.\n- So, safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U): to (3,4)\n- Walls: (3,4) - not a wall.\n- Body collision:\n  - (3,4) not in body segments.\n- Food at (3,4)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D): to (3,2)\n- Walls: (3,2) - not a wall.\n- Body collision:\n  - (3,2) not in body segments.\n- Food at (3,2)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move from current head position (3,3):\n\n1. Food at (3,5):\n   - Distance from (3,3): |3-3| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Cannot reach in one move (only moves of distance 1).\n   \n2. Food at (6,3):\n   - Distance from (3,3): |6-3| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten in the immediate next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (6,2). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\nAdjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right), not diagonal.\n\nHead at (3,3), tail at (6,2):\n- (3,3) and (6,2): |3-6| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\nNot adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n\nAlso, is there positive food on the tail?\nTail is at (6,2). Food is at (3,5) and (6,3), not (6,2). So no.\n\n### Checking Future Moves for Food\n\nWhile we can't reach food in one move, let's see if moving in a certain direction sets us up better for future food:\n\n- Food at (3,5) is above current head (3,3).\n- Food at (6,3) is to the right of current head.\n\nCurrent direction is L (left), so moving left is continuing in that direction, up or down are turns.\n\nMoving left (L) to (2,3) doesn't immediately help reach either food.\nMoving up (U) to (3,4) gets us closer to (3,5).\nMoving down (D) to (3,2) moves away from both foods.\n\nBetween U and D, U seems better as it moves towards (3,5).\n\n### Checking Safety of Moving Up (U)\n\nMove to (3,4):\n- Next possible moves from (3,4):\n  - Current direction would be U (since we moved up).\n  - Possible next moves: U (up to (3,5)), L (left to (2,4)), R (right to (4,4))\n    - Cannot move D (down) as it's opposite of U.\n  \nFrom (3,4), moving U to (3,5) would eat the food there (if it's still present after countdown decreases).\nBut let's check if that would cause tail reward danger:\nAfter eating at (3,5), the tail grows by one, so the new tail would be where the current tail is (6,2), but the body extends.\nBut the head would be at (3,5), tail at (6,2), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving L or R from (3,4) could also be safe, but U seems to aim for food.\n\n### Checking Moving Left (L)\n\nMove to (2,3):\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n- Current direction L, so can't move R.\n- Possible: U (to (2,4)), D (to (2,2)), L (to (1,3))\n  \nNot immediately helpful for food, but could be safe.\n\n### Checking Moving Down (D)\n\nMove to (3,2):\nFrom (3,2), possible moves:\n- Current direction D, so can't move U.\n- Possible: L (to (2,2)), R (to (4,2)), D (to (3,1))\n  \nMoves away from food, not ideal.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U, D, L:\n- U moves towards food (3,5), safe.\n- L is safe but not towards food.\n- D moves away from food.\n\nBest choice seems U (Up).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\nIs (3,4) safe?\n- Not a wall.\n- Not in body: body is at (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2).\n- No food at (3,4) to cause issues.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Up (U)** seems the best choice to position the snake closer to the positive food at (3,5) while avoiding any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(4,4): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body and food positions to better understand the scenario.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (3,4)\n  - Next segments: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n  \n  So the snake's body forms a sort of \"S\" shape starting from (3,4) going down to (3,3), then right to (4,3), up to (4,4), right to (5,4), right to (6,4), then down to (6,3).\n\n- Food:\n  - (3,5): Above the head (since head is at (3,4), so directly up.\n  - (6,3): This is the tail's current position (last segment).\n  - (4,4): This is part of the snake's body (4th segment after head).\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (3,4) with Direction U\n\nFrom the current head position (3,4) and direction U (up), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3,5)\n   - This is where one of the food items is located.\n2. **Left (L)**: (2,4)\n   - Need to check if this is a valid move (not into wall or body).\n3. **Right (R)**: (4,4)\n   - This is currently occupied by the snake's body (4th segment).\n4. **Down (D)**: (3,3)\n   - This is the immediate body segment after the head, so moving down would cause the head to collide with the body in the next step (since the body moves forward, the tail would move away, but the segment at (3,3) would move to where the head is now, and the head would be at (3,3), which is now occupied by the next body segment moving there). Wait, no: actually, moving down would make the head go to (3,3), and the current (3,3) would move to (4,3), etc., so the head would not collide with the body immediately because the body moves forward. But since the current direction is U, moving D is the opposite direction, which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nWait, let's clarify the \"no instant reverse\" rule. The snake cannot move in the opposite direction of its current head direction on the next turn. Current direction is U (up), so opposite is D (down). So moving D is not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nNow let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (3,5)\n\n- New head position: (3,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,5) is within borders (x=0-7, y=0-7), and not an internal obstacle.\n  - Body: Is (3,5) in the snake's body? Current body segments: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). No, (3,5) is not in the body.\n- Food at (3,5):\n  - Value: +1\n  - Life span: 4\n  - Eating this food would increase length by 1 (new segment added at the end).\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (6,3). The head is moving to (3,5), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is |3-6| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent). So no danger here.\n  \nSo moving U is safe and would eat positive food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (2,4)\n\n- New head position: (2,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (2,4) is within borders, and not in internal obstacles (internal obstacles are (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)). So safe.\n  - Body: Is (2,4) in the body? No.\n- Food: No food at (2,4).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (4,4)\n\n- New head position: (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,4) is within borders, not an internal obstacle.\n  - Body: (4,4) is the 4th segment of the body. Normally, moving into body is deadly, but there's a special case: if the food is under the body and the body moves away, and the head moves onto it, it can be eaten.\n  - Here, (4,4) is a body segment and also has food (value=1, life_span=10).\n  - For food under body to be eaten:\n    1. The body moves away: The segment at (4,4) is followed by (5,4). If the snake moves right, the head goes to (4,4), and the segment at (4,4) would move to where (5,4) is, but (5,4) is already occupied by the next segment, so the body doesn't move away; it's more like the head is trying to occupy the same space as the body segment before it moves. This seems like a collision.\n    2. The head moves onto the food cell: Even if the body could move away, the head moving into (4,4) would collide with the body segment there before it moves.\n  \nSo this seems like a collision, hence deadly.

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 20  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (3,5), then body segments at (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)  \nSo the snake's length is 8.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which means it was moving in the positive y-direction last turn)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (6,3): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - This is at the same position as the snake's tail (6,3).\n   - Since the tail is at (6,3), and the head is at (3,5), they are not adjacent (distance is more than 1), so no immediate danger from \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - To eat this, the head would need to move to (6,3), but currently, the head is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (6,3). So we can't eat this food this turn.\n   \n2. (4,4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - This is at the same position as one of the snake's body segments (4,4).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away, and then the head must move onto (4,4).\n   - Currently, the head is at (3,5), which is adjacent to (4,5), (2,5), (3,6), (3,4). (4,4) is not adjacent to (3,5) (distance is sqrt(2)), so we can't move the head directly to (4,4) this turn.\n   - Therefore, we cannot eat this food this turn either.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (3,5) with Current Direction U\n\nFrom direction U (up, positive y), the possible moves are U, L, R (can't reverse to D).\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **U (Up) to (3,6)**:\n   - Check walls: y=7 is border, so (3,6) is not a wall.\n   - Check obstacles: (3,6) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). (3,6) is not in these.\n   - So moving U is safe.\n\n2. **L (Left) to (2,5)**:\n   - Check walls: x=0 is border, (2,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), etc. (2,5) is not an obstacle.\n   - Check body: (2,5) is not in snake body.\n   - So moving L is safe.\n\n3. **R (Right) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is border, (4,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check obstacles: (4,6), (4,1) are obstacles, but (4,5) is not.\n   - Check body: (4,5) is not in snake body.\n   - So moving R is safe.\n\nAll three possible moves are safe in terms of not hitting walls or body.\n\n### Evaluating Food Access\n\nNeither food can be eaten this turn directly, as discussed earlier. So the immediate goal is to position the snake to potentially eat food in future turns while staying safe.\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (6,3) is at the tail. The tail will move forward if the snake doesn't grow. So if we don't eat anything, the tail moves from (6,3), and the food at (6,3) will be free next turn if its life_span allows (but its life_span is 1, so it disappears after this turn). So we can't eat this food.\n- (4,4) is under the body. To eat it, we'd need the body to move away and then head to (4,4). But the body at (4,4) is not the tail, so it won't move unless the snake grows. Since we can't eat this turn, it's not immediately helpful.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, the priority is to stay safe and position for future moves.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's see which move might set us up better for future food:\n\n- Moving U to (3,6):\n  - Next turn, from (3,6), possible moves would be U (to (3,7) which is y=7, a wall - invalid), L (to (2,6)), R (to (4,6)). (4,6) is an obstacle, so only L is possible next turn if we go U now.\n  \n- Moving L to (2,5):\n  - From (2,5), next moves depend on direction. If we go L, direction is L, so next can't go R. Possible moves would be U (to (2,6)), L (to (1,5)), D (to (2,4)). (1,5) is an obstacle, so U or D.\n  \n- Moving R to (4,5):\n  - From (4,5), direction R, so next can't go L. Possible moves: U (to (4,6) - obstacle), R (to (5,5)), D (to (4,4)). (4,4) is body now, but if tail moves, it might be free. But currently, (4,4) is body, so D would be unsafe unless tail moves away.\n\nGiven that moving U limits our next move to only L (to (2,6)), which might not be ideal, and moving R could lead to a potential dead end next turn, moving L seems the most flexible.\n\nMoving L to (2,5):\n- Next turn, from (2,5), we can go U to (2,6) or D to (2,4). (2,6) is not an obstacle or wall, and (2,4) is currently free.\n\nThis seems like the most open option.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving L to (2,5)?\n- No walls or obstacles.\n- No body segments there.\n- Not adjacent to tail with positive food (tail is at (6,3), far away).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **L (Left) to (2,5)** seems the safest and most flexible move for the current turn, as it doesn't lead to immediate dead ends and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Additional walls at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), and (2,6). These are like barriers within the grid.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)].\n   - **Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving left (L), meaning its last move was from (3,5) to (2,5).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - **First Food**: At (6,3) with a life span of 5 turns and a value of +1 (positive food).\n   - **Second Food**: At (4,4) with a life span of 8 turns and a value of +1 (positive food).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position and the food locations:\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head: (2,5)\n  - Next segments: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n  \n  This means the snake's body forms a path from (2,5) to (6,4).\n\n- **Food Locations**:\n  - (6,3): Below the tail segment (6,4).\n  - (4,4): Occupied by the snake's body (it's the 6th segment from the head).\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the last move was Left (from (3,5) to (2,5)), the next move cannot be Right (opposite of Left).\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**: Check if moving in a direction would hit a wall.\n   - Current head: (2,5)\n     - Up (U): (2,6) - Check if (2,6) is a wall.\n       - Internal obstacles include (2,6), so it's a wall. Cannot move Up.\n     - Down (D): (2,4) - Check walls:\n       - y=4 is not a border wall, and (2,4) is not listed as an internal obstacle. Safe.\n     - Left (L): (1,5) - Check walls:\n       - x=1 is not a border wall (border is x=0), but (1,5) is an internal obstacle. Cannot move Left.\n     - Right (R): (3,5) - Already disallowed due to no instant reverse.\n\n   So, possible moves after considering walls and no reverse: Down (D).\n\n3. **Body Collisions**: Check if moving Down would cause the head to collide with the body.\n   - Move Down: (2,5) -> (2,4)\n   - Snake body segments: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n   - (2,4) is not in the body segments. Safe.\n\n### Checking Food Interactions\n\nNow, let's see if moving Down would interact with any food:\n\n1. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - Moving to (2,4) doesn't reach (6,3). No interaction.\n   \n2. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Currently, (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body (6th segment).\n   - To eat this food:\n     - The body must move away from (4,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, moving Down doesn't affect (4,4)'s occupation immediately.\n     - The tail is at (6,4), so next turn the tail will move forward, but (4,4) is not the tail, so it won't vacate yet.\n   - So, no immediate eating of (4,4) by moving Down.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is a special rule where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the newly grown tail would collide with the head.\n\n- Current tail: (6,4)\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,4), (6,3), (7,4), (6,5)\n   - (5,4) is part of the snake's body (second to last segment).\n   - (6,3) has food.\n   - (7,4) is a wall (x=7).\n   - (6,5) is not a wall (but y=5 is not a border wall, and no internal obstacle there).\n   \n- Head is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to tail (6,4). So, no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Evaluating the Only Possible Move: Down (D)\n\nSince Up and Left are blocked by walls, and Right is disallowed due to no instant reverse, the only possible move is Down.\n\n- New head position: (2,4)\n- Check if this is beneficial:\n  - No food at (2,4), so no score change.\n  - Doesn't lead to immediate collision.\n  - Keeps the snake safe for now.\n\n### Is There Any Other Consideration?\n\nIs there a way to reach the food at (6,3)?\n\n- Currently, the food is at (6,3), and the tail is at (6,4).\n- To eat (6,3), the tail must move away, and then the head must move onto it.\n- This would require multiple moves to position the head near (6,3) while ensuring the tail moves off (6,4).\n- Given the current position, it's not immediately feasible to reach (6,3) safely in one move.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (4,4) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the constraints:\n\n- Only possible move without collision or rule violation: Down (D).\n- Moving Down is safe and doesn't lead to any immediate negative consequences.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but we cannot instantly reverse, so we cannot go Up (opposite of Down). So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: Current direction is D, moving to (2,3).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is the bottom wall, (2,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body segments are at (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). (2,3) is not in the body.\n     - Obstacles: Check internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). (2,3) is not an obstacle.\n   - Food at (2,3)? No food there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (1,4).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is left wall, (1,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (1,4) is not in the body segments.\n     - Obstacles: (1,2) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,4) is not listed.\n   - Food at (1,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (3,4).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is right wall, (3,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (3,5), (3,4), etc. (3,4) is a body segment.\n     - But note: (3,4) is the 4th body segment. The tail is at (5,4), so (3,4) is not the tail. Moving into a non-tail body segment is deadly.\n   - This would cause a collision with the body. **Not safe**.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a risk:\n\n1. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Currently, (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body (7th segment).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away first, then the head moves onto it. Currently, the head is at (2,4), and (4,4) is two steps right. We can't reach it in one move.\n   - Also, the tail is at (5,4), which is adjacent to (4,4). If we try to eat (4,4), it would mean the head moves to (4,4) when the tail is at (5,4). After eating, the tail grows, so the new tail would be at (5,4), and the head at (4,4), which are adjacent, leading to a collision next turn. This is the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - **Avoid eating (4,4)** due to Tail Reward Danger.\n\n2. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - From head at (2,4), to reach (6,3), we'd need to go right and down.\n   - Possible path: Right to (3,4) - but (3,4) is body, so can't. Alternative is Down to (2,3), then right, etc.\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n3. **Food at (5,6)**:\n   - From (2,4), to reach (5,6), need to go right and up.\n   - Current direction is D, can't go U instantly.\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- D: Safe, no reward.\n- L: Safe, no reward.\n- R: Deadly (collision with body).\n\nBetween D and L, both are safe with no immediate reward. We can choose either, but let's think about future moves:\n\n- If we go D to (2,3):\n  - Next moves could be L to (1,3) or R to (3,3) (can't go U opposite of D).\n  - (3,3) is body, so only L is safe.\n  - This seems like we're getting boxed in.\n\n- If we go L to (1,4):\n  - Next moves could be D to (1,3), L to (0,4) (wall), or U to (1,5) (obstacle).\n  - Only D is safe.\n  - Then from (1,3), options are limited.\n\nNeither seems great, but going D seems slightly better because from (2,3), we can go L to (1,3), then maybe down to (1,2) but that's an obstacle. Alternatively, from (2,3), after L to (1,3), D to (1,2) is obstacle, so only R to (2,2) is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe going L first is better to explore other areas.\n\nGiven that both are equally safe with no immediate reward, and no clear better future path, I'll choose Down to keep options open.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Down (D) to (2,2)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so (2,2) is not a wall.\n- Internal obstacles: Check if (2,2) is in the list: no.\n- Body collision: Snake body segments are at (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2) is not in this list.\n  \nSo, moving to (2,2) is safe.\n\nFood at (2,2)? No food listed there.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1,3)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so (1,3) is not a wall.\n- Internal obstacles: (1,2) and (1,5) are obstacles, but not (1,3).\n- Body collision: (1,3) is not in the snake's body segments.\n\nSafe move.\n\nFood at (1,3)? No food listed there.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3,3)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=7 is at x=7, so (3,3) is not a wall.\n- Internal obstacles: Not in the list.\n- Body collision: (3,3) is in the snake's body segments (6th segment from head). \n\nBut according to the rules, moving into the tail's current position is allowed because the tail will move forward. The tail is at (4,4). Wait, let's see the body order:\n\nSnake: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nSo the tail is at (4,4), and the segment before tail is (4,3). (3,3) is not the tail, it's the 6th segment. So moving to (3,3) would collide with the body (since it's not the tail). \n\nWait, the rule says: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo only the tail's current position is safe to move into, not other body parts. (3,3) is not the tail, so this would be a body collision. Therefore, moving Right to (3,3) is not safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head (2,3):\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,3):\n- Up (U): (2,4) - but current direction is D, cannot go U (opposite)\n- Down (D): (2,2)\n- Left (L): (1,3)\n- Right (R): (3,3) - but we saw this is unsafe\n\nFood positions:\n1. (6,3): not adjacent\n2. (4,4): not adjacent\n3. (5,6): not adjacent\n\nSo no food is directly adjacent to the head where we can move safely to eat it this turn.\n\nHowever, there's food at (4,4), which is currently under the snake's body (tail is at (4,4)). \n\nSpecial case rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4,4) with food. If the tail moves away, then next turn the head could move to (4,4) to eat it. But we can't do that this turn.\n\nSimilarly, other food items are not immediately accessible.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,4), which has food (value=1). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nHead at (2,3), tail at (4,4). Adjacent means Manhattan distance of 1:\n|2-4| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n\nSo no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom the safe moves:\n- Down to (2,2)\n- Left to (1,3)\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so we should choose a move that keeps options open and doesn't box us in.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nCurrent head at (2,3). Moving:\n- Down to (2,2): then next moves could be L/R (can't go back up immediately)\n- Left to (1,3): then next moves could be U/D (can't go right immediately)\n\nWhich is better?\n\nLooking at the surroundings:\n- Moving Down to (2,2): next to walls at y=0 (y=2 is safe), but not near obstacles.\n- Moving Left to (1,3): near internal obstacles at (1,2) and (1,5), but (1,3) is clear.\n\nBoth seem okay, but moving Down might be better because it's moving towards the center where there's more space to maneuver, whereas moving Left is towards the edge where there are more obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about future food access:\n- Food at (6,3): to reach it, moving right is generally better, but we can't safely move right now.\n- Food at (4,4): need to move the tail away first, so moving Down might help in that direction.\n\nGiven that, moving Down seems slightly better.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nJust to confirm, no food is at (2,2) or (1,3), so no immediate score gain from either move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (Down and Left), Down seems slightly better for keeping options open.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Tail: (4, 3)\n- **Current Direction**: The snake's head is moving **Down (D)**, which means its last movement was from (2,1) to (2,2) (assuming it was moving up before, but since it's now at (2,2) with direction D, it must have come from (2,1)).\n\n#### Food:\nThere are three food items with their positions, remaining lifespan, and value:\n1.

(5, 6): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\nAll foods are positive (value = +1).\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is D, the snake cannot move U next (as that would be the opposite direction).\n   - Allowed moves: D, L, R\n2. **Wall and Body Collisions**: The move must not result in the head colliding with a wall or the snake's body (except the tail, which moves away).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D):\n- Current head: (2, 2)\n- New head position: (2, 1)\n- Check:\n  - Is (2,1) a wall? y=1 is not a border wall (y=0 is). Internal walls don't include (2,1). So, not a wall.\n  - Is (2,1) in snake body? Snake body positions are from (2,2) to (4,3). (2,1) is not in the list.\n- Valid move.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n- Current head: (2, 2)\n- New head position: (1, 2)\n- Check:\n  - Is (1,2) a wall? Internal walls include (1,2). So, it's a wall.\n- Invalid move (collision with wall).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n- Current head: (2, 2)\n- New head position: (3, 2)\n- Check:\n  - Is (3,2) a wall? Not a border wall, and not in internal walls list.\n  - Is (3,2) in snake body? Snake body: (2,2), (2,3), ..., (4,3). (3,2) is not in the list.\n- Valid move.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves: D and R\n\nNow, between D and R, which is better? We should consider:\n- Proximity to food.\n- Potential dangers (like moving towards the tail with food).\n\n#### Food Positions:\n1. (6, 3): Distance from (2,2) is |6-2| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5\n2. (4, 4): Distance = |4-2| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n3. (5, 6): Distance = |5-2| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nClosest food is at (4,4), distance 4.\n\n#### Move D to (2,1):\n- Distance to (4,4): |4-2| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- Distance to (6,3): |6-2| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- Distance to (5,6): |5-2| + |6-1| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- Not moving closer to any food.\n\n#### Move R to (3,2):\n- Distance to (4,4): |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 (closer to (4,4))\n- Distance to (6,3): |6-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- Distance to (5,6): |5-3| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- Moving R gets us closer to (4,4) and (6,3).\n\n#### Checking for Tail Reward Danger:\n- Tail is at (4,3).\n- Adjacent to head (2,2): Positions adjacent to (2,2) are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n  - (4,3) is not adjacent to (2,2) (distance is |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3, not 1).\n  - So, no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n#### Other Considerations:\n- Moving R to (3,2) is safe and moves towards food.\n- Moving D to (2,1) doesn't help in getting food and might lead to being cornered.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** towards the closest food at (4,4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Additional walls at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are specific cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n   - Head: (4, 2)\n   - Body segments: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n   - So, the tail is at (3,4).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving to the **Right (R)**. This means the last move was to the right, so the previous position was to the left of the current head.\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (4,4): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (5,6): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - (3,4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body and the food positions to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head at (4,2)\n  - Then (3,2), (2,2), then turns up to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), then right to (3,5), then down to (3,4)\n  \n  This forms a shape where the snake starts at (4,2), goes left to (2,2), then up to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then down to (3,4).\n\n- **Food Positions**:\n  - (4,4): Positive food (value=4)\n  - (5,6): Positive food (value=6)\n  - (3,4): Positive food (value=9) - **This is under the snake's tail!**\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move from (4,2) to (5,2)\n   - Check if (5,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not a border wall (x=0 or 7), and (5,2) is not in internal obstacles.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: The body segments are (3,2), (2,2), etc. (5,2) is not in the list.\n   - Is there food at (5,2)? No.\n   - So, moving Right is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move from (4,2) to (4,3)\n   - Check (4,3):\n     - Not a wall: y=3 is not a border, and (4,3) is not in internal obstacles.\n     - Not in snake body: Checking the list, (4,3) is not there.\n   - Food at (4,3)? No.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move from (4,2) to (4,1)\n   - Check (4,1):\n     - Internal obstacle at (4,1) - this is a wall! So cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, from the above, possible safe moves are Right and Up. Down is invalid due to a wall.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten:\n\n1. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Currently, the snake's head is at (4,2). To reach (4,4), the path would be Up twice.\n   - But we can only decide the immediate next move. Moving Up now would take us to (4,3), then next turn could go to (4,4).\n   - However, the life_span of (4,4) is 1, and countdown decreases this turn (from 1 to 0), so it will disappear after this turn. So, we cannot reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (5,6)**:\n   - From (4,2), to reach (5,6), need to go Right to (5,2), then Up four times.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach in time.\n\n3. **Food at (3,4)**:\n   - This is under the snake's tail at (3,4).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The tail must move away first, then the head moves onto it.\n     - Currently, the tail is at (3,4), and the segment before it is (3,5).\n     - The tail moves in the direction from (3,5) to (3,4), so next it will move to where (3,5) was, but since the snake grows when eating, the tail doesn't move.\n     - Actually, to eat food under the tail:\n       - The head moves to the tail's current position after the tail has moved away.\n       - But the tail only moves if the snake doesn't eat food.\n       - So, if we move the head to (3,4) now, the tail is still there, and the head would collide with the tail after growing, which is deadly (\"Tail Reward Danger\").\n   - So, eating (3,4) is deadly.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above:\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,2) is safe but doesn't eat food.\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,3) is safe but doesn't eat food.\n- Moving Down (D) is invalid.\n- Trying to eat any food is either impossible within the life_span or deadly.\n\nBetween R and U, which is better?\n\n- Moving Right (R): Heads towards the center-right of the grid.\n- Moving Up (U): Heads towards the top, but the snake's body is above (from (2,2) to (2,5)), so moving up might eventually lead to more open space.\n\nGiven that both are safe and neither leads to immediate food, we can choose either. Moving Up might be slightly better as it moves away from the body's current position.\n\nHowever, the snake's current direction is Right, and continuing Right might be more straightforward unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nBut looking at the snake's body, moving Right to (5,2) is safe, and then next moves could be Up towards (5,3), etc., which seems open.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up to (4,3) is also safe, and then next moves could be Right to (5,3), etc.\n\nGiven that both are equally safe and no immediate food is available, and considering that the snake was moving Right, continuing Right maintains the current direction unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nBut since both are equally valid, and no immediate advantage, perhaps Right is slightly better as it's the current direction.\n\nHowever, looking at the grid, moving Right to (5,2) is near the right border (x=7), which might limit future moves, whereas moving Up to (4,3) is more central.\n\nGiven that, moving Up might be slightly better for future flexibility.\n\nBut the rules state that as a non-thinking executor, we should follow the immediate safe move without long-term planning.\n\nGiven that, both R and U are safe, and since no food is immediately available, either is acceptable. \n\nBut the snake's body is to the left and above, so moving Right might be better to move away from the body.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest immediate moves are Right or Up. Since moving Right continues the current direction and moves away from the body, it seems slightly preferable.\n\nHowever, the food at (3,4) is under the tail, and moving Left would be towards it, but Left is the opposite of current direction (R), so it's not allowed.\n\nThus, the possible actions are R or U. Given no immediate food benefit, and to maintain direction, choosing Right.\n\nBut actually, looking back, the snake's body is to the left (from (3,2) to (2,2)...), so moving Right moves away from the body, which is good.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(4,4) - value: 1, life_span: 3\n2. (5,6) - value: 1, life_span: 5\n3. (3,4) - value: 1, life_span: 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,2) with direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (5,3)\n- **D (Down)**: (5,1)\n- **R (Right)**: (6,2)\n- **L (Left)**: (4,2)\n\nBut we cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. Therefore, we cannot move Left (L) next. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collision) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,2)\n- Check walls: x=7 is a wall, so (6,2) is within bounds.\n- Check snake body: \n  - Snake body segments: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)\n  - (6,2) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (6,2)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,3)\n- Check walls: y=7 is max, (5,3) is within bounds.\n- Check obstacles: (5,3) is not in internal obstacles.\n- Check body: (5,3) is not in body segments.\n- Food at (5,3)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,1)\n- Check walls: y=0 is min, (5,1) is within bounds.\n- Check obstacles: (5,1) is not in internal obstacles.\n- Check body: (5,1) is not in body segments.\n- Food at (5,1)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon or if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (4,4) - life_span 3\n2. (5,6) - life_span 5\n3. (3,4) - life_span 8\n\nFrom head at (5,2):\n- (4,4): distance is |5-4| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (5,6): distance is |5-5| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- (3,4): distance is |5-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n(4,4) is closest with distance 3 and life_span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including this one. So it's possible to reach it if we move optimally.\n\nCurrent path to (4,4):\nFrom (5,2), need to go left to (4,2), then up to (4,3), then up to (4,4).\n\nBut current direction is R, and next move cannot be L (opposite of R). So we cannot go left immediately. So we cannot reach (4,4) in time because:\n- Turn 27: cannot go left, must go U, D, or R.\n  - If we go U to (5,3), then next turn can go L to (4,3), then U to (4,4) on turn 29. But food disappears after turn 29 (since life_span 3 at turn 27: 27,28,29). So can reach on turn 29, just in time.\n  - Other moves (D or R) will not help reach (4,4) in time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is too far (distance 4, life_span 5), but we can't reach it in time because:\n- To go from (5,2) to (5,6) need to go up 4 steps, but life_span is 5, so possible if we go up every turn: 27:U to (5,3), 28:U to (5,4), 29:U to (5,5), 30:U to (5,6). But life_span is 5 from turn 27, so disappears after turn 31, so can reach by turn 30. But is it safe?\n\nCheck if moving towards (5,6) is safe:\nCurrent body: after moving U to (5,3), body is (5,2), (4,2), ..., (3,5)\nNext move U to (5,4): body is (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (3,5)\nThen U to (5,5): body is (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (3,5)\nThen U to (5,6): eats food, grows, new tail is old tail (which is (3,5)), so body is (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (3,5)\nIs this safe? No collision at (5,6).\n\nBut is there any risk in moving up initially? Let's see immediate move U to (5,3):\n- Current body: (5,2), (4,2), ..., (3,5)\n- New head at (5,3): not in body, not in walls, safe.\n- Then next move can be U to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then U to (5,6) to eat food.\n\nAlternatively, can we reach (3,4)? Distance 4, life_span 8, so can reach by turn 31 (27+4), disappears after turn 34, so possible.\nPath: from (5,2), need to go left twice and up twice, e.g., L to (4,2), L to (3,2), U to (3,3), U to (3,4). But first move cannot be L (current direction R), so must go U first to (5,3), then L to (4,3), L to (3,3), U to (3,4). Takes 4 moves, can reach by turn 30.\n\nBetween (4,4) and (5,6), (4,4) is closer and can be reached just in time if we start moving towards it now by going U to (5,3), then L to (4,3), then U to (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) can be reached by going U all the way, but takes longer.\n\n(3,4) is also reachable but further.\n\nGiven that (4,4) is about to disappear soon (life_span 3), it's better to prioritize it.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous?\nTail is at (3,5). Is there food at (3,5)? No, food is at (3,4), (4,4), (5,6). So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to start moving towards (4,4) by going Up to (5,3), then next turn can go Left to (4,3), then Up to (4,4) to eat the food just before it disappears.\n\nOther moves:\n- Right to (6,2): safe but not towards any food.\n- Down to (5,1): safe but not towards any food.\n- Up to (5,3): starts path to (4,4).\n\nTherefore, choose Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 28  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (5,3), followed by body segments:  \n(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)  \nSo the tail is at (2,5).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1.

Move Up (U) to (5,4)\n- **Position**: (5,4)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: x=5 is not a wall, y=4 is not a wall. No internal obstacles at (5,4).\n  - Body: Check if (5,4) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n    - (5,4) is not in the body.\n- **Food at (5,4)**: No food listed at (5,4).\n- **Adjacent to tail**: Tail is at (2,5). Distance from (5,4) to (2,5) is |5-2| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4,3)\n- **Position**: (4,3)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: x=4 is not a wall, y=3 is not a wall. Check internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6) — none at (4,3).\n  - Body: (4,3) is not in the current body segments.\n- **Food at (4,3)**: No food listed at (4,3).\n- **Adjacent to tail**: Distance to (2,5) is |4-2| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,3)\n- **Position**: (6,3)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: x=6 is not a wall (border is x=7), y=3 is not a wall. No internal obstacles at (6,3).\n  - Body: (6,3) is not in the current body segments.\n- **Food at (6,3)**: No food listed at (6,3).\n- **Adjacent to tail**: Distance to (2,5) is |6-2| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6, not adjacent.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move from the current head position (5,3):\n\n- (4,4): To reach (4,4) from (5,3), need to move Left then Up (but can't do both in one move).\n  - Current move can't reach it directly.\n- (5,6): To reach (5,6) from (5,3), need to move Up three times.\n  - Next move Up to (5,4) would be a step towards it.\n- (3,4): To reach (3,4) from (5,3), need to move Left twice then Up once.\n  - Not reachable in one move.\n- (4,5): To reach (4,5) from (5,3), need to move Left then Up twice.\n  - Not reachable in one move.\n\nSo, no food is directly reachable in the next move. However, moving Up to (5,4) is a step towards (5,6), which is positive food with life_span=4.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nIf we move Up to (5,4):\n- Next turn, from (5,4), possible moves would be U to (5,5), L to (4,4), or R to (6,4).\n  - (4,4) has food (value=1, life_span=2). After this turn, life_span decreases to 1, then next turn to 0 (disappears). So next turn is the last chance to eat (4,4).\n  - Moving Left to (4,4) next turn would eat the food, but need to ensure it's safe.\n\nBut let's see the tail position after moving Up this turn:\n- Current tail is at (2,5). After moving head to (5,4), the tail moves forward, so the segment at (2,5) is removed, new tail is at (2,4).\n- Distance from (4,4) to (2,4) is |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2, not adjacent, so safe to eat.\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (5,6) is also a good path, but (5,6) has life_span=4, so we have more time.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should also ensure that moving Up doesn't lead us into a dead end where we can't move further without colliding in future turns.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4):\n- From (5,4), can go U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n  - (5,5): no immediate issues.\n  - (4,4): food, safe as above.\n  - (6,4): no issues.\n  \nFrom (5,5), can continue towards (5,6).\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nAll three initial moves (U, L, R) are safe with no immediate food. However:\n- Moving Up (U) is a step towards (5,6) and also positions us to potentially eat (4,4) next turn.\n- Moving Left (L) or Right (R) doesn't provide immediate food opportunities and doesn't seem to lead towards any food directly.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nOne risk is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n- Currently, tail is at (2,5), head at (5,3). Distance is 4, not adjacent.\n- After moving Up to (5,4), tail moves to (2,4). Distance to (5,4) is 3, still not adjacent.\n- So no risk of this in the immediate move.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving Up is safe, doesn't lead to immediate food but positions us better for future food collection (especially (4,4) next turn and (5,6) in subsequent turns), it seems the best immediate action.\n\nMoving Left or Right doesn't offer any immediate advantages and might lead us away from food sources.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Head: (5, 4)\n  2. (5, 3)\n  3. (5, 2)\n  4. (4, 2)\n  5. (3, 2)\n  6. (2, 2)\n  7. (2, 3)\n  8.

(4, 5, 9, 1) - Positive food (value +9), life_span 1\n\n### Possible Moves\nFrom the current head position (5, 4) and direction U, the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (5, 5)\n- **D (Down)**: (5, 3) - But this is the current body segment right after the head, so it's a collision.\n- **L (Left)**: (4, 4)\n- **R (Right)**: (6, 4)\n\nHowever, we cannot move in the opposite direction of the current direction (U's opposite is D), so D is not allowed. Thus, the possible moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n#### 1. Move U to (5, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, so (5,5) is safe.\n  - Body: Check if (5,5) is in the snake's body segments.\n    - Current body: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n    - (5,5) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (5,5)? No food listed at (5,5).\n- Next head position: (5,5)\n- After moving, the tail (2,4) will move forward, so the new tail is (2,3).\n- No immediate food to eat, so no growth; tail moves away from (2,4).\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move L to (4, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is the left wall, (4,4) is safe.\n  - Body: Check if (4,4) is in the body.\n    - Body segments: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n    - (4,4) is not in the body, safe.\n- Food at (4,4): Yes, value=1, life_span=1.\n  - Eating this food: \n    - Reward: +1\n    - Length increases by 1: new tail is not removed, so new body will be [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), ..., (2,3)] (length 9)\n    - Check for Tail Reward Danger: \n      - Current tail is (2,4), next is (2,3) after move.\n      - Is (2,4) a positive food? No, it's part of the snake's body.\n      - The food is at (4,4), not adjacent to tail, so no danger.\n- After eating, the food disappears.\n\nThis move is safe and eats a positive food.\n\n#### 3. Move R to (6, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, (6,4) is safe.\n  - Body: Check if (6,4) is in the body.\n    - Not in the body, safe.\n- Food at (6,4)? No food listed at (6,4).\n- No food eaten, so tail moves forward to (2,3).\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n- **U (5,5)**: Safe, no food.\n- **L (4,4)**: Safe, eat +1 food.\n- **R (6,4)**: Safe, no food.\n\nThe best immediate reward is from moving L to eat the +1 food at (4,4).\n\n### Checking Other Foods\nAre there other foods that can be reached soon that are more valuable?\n- (5,6,3,1): To reach this, need to go up twice: (5,4)->(5,5)->(5,6). But life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn (turn 30), meaning we can't reach it in time.\n- (3,4,6,1): Need to go left twice: (5,4)->(4,4)->(3,4). But life_span is 1, disappears next turn, so can't reach in time.\n- (4,5,9,1): Need (5,4)->(5,5)->(4,5) or (5,4)->(4,4)->(4,5). Life_span is 1, disappears next turn, can't reach in time.\n\nThus, the only food we can eat immediately is at (4,4).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger for (4,4)\nThe rule states:\n> If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- Current tail is (2,4).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (1,4), (3,4), (2,5), (2,3).\n- Head is at (5,4), not adjacent to (2,4).\n- Food is at (4,4), not on the tail.\nSo no danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (4,4) to eat the +1 food safely.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So no Tail Reward Danger.\n     - Safe to eat.\n   - After moving up, new head at (4,5), tail would normally move, but since we're eating, length increases, so tail stays, and new segment added at (4,4).\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (4,3) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (4,3): No food here.\n   - No immediate reward, just moving to an empty space.\n   - After moving down, new head at (4,3), tail moves forward, last segment (2,4) is removed.\n\n### Comparing the Moves\n\nNow, let's compare the three options based on food value and safety:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (3,4)**:\n   - Food value: +5\n   - Safe: Yes\n   - Benefit: High (+5)\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - Food value: +8\n   - Safe: Yes\n   - Benefit: Higher (+8)\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - Food value: 0\n   - Safe: Yes\n   - Benefit: None\n\nBetween Left and Up, Up offers a higher reward (+8 vs +5). Down offers no reward. So, Up is the best choice here.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Up\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure moving Up is safe beyond immediate collisions:\n\n- After moving Up to (4,5), the snake's new positions would be:\n  - Head: (4,5)\n  - Body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n  - Length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at (4,4), but (4,4) is already the first body segment, so effectively the snake grows by one at (4,4).\n\nNow, is there any immediate danger in the next move? Not directly, but we're not planning ahead here, just deciding the immediate move.\n\n### Considering Food Lifespan\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. So, we have to eat them now or lose them. This makes the high-value food at (4,5) even more attractive.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two rewarding moves (Left to (3,4) for +5 and Up to (4,5) for +8), moving Up gives a higher reward and is safe. Moving Down offers no reward. Therefore, the best immediate action is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 31  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (4,5), followed by:\n- (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5,6): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (3,4): value=4, life_span=1\n3. (4,3): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's body to understand possible moves and collisions.\n\nSnake body segments:\n- Head: (4,5)\n- Next: (4,4)\n- Then: (5,4)\n- Then: (5,3)\n- Then: (5,2)\n- Then: (4,2)\n- Then: (3,2)\n- Then: (2,2)\n- Then: (2,3)\n- Then: (2,4) [tail]\n\nFood positions:\n- (5,6): near the top-right\n- (3,4): left side\n- (4,3): below the head\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,5), Direction U\n\nFrom the current direction (U), the snake can't instantly reverse to Down (D). So possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (4,6)\n- Left (L): (3,5)\n- Right (R): (5,5)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,6) is an internal obstacle (from the list: (4,6)). So this is a wall, can't move here. Deadly collision.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - Check walls: (3,5) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n   - Check snake body: The snake's body segments are:\n     - (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n     - (3,5) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - Food check: Is there food at (3,5)? No, the foods are at (5,6), (3,4), (4,3).\n   - So this is a safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (5,5)**:\n   - Check walls: (5,5) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n   - Check snake body: (5,5) is not in the body segments.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - Food check: No food at (5,5).\n   - Safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food items and see if we can reach any safely in the next move.\n\n1. **(5,6)**: value=1, life=1\n   - Adjacent to head (4,5)? \n     - (4,5) to (5,6): Right then Up (RU), but can't do both in one move.\n     - Direct moves: From (4,5), to reach (5,6), need to go Right to (5,5), then Up to (5,6) next turn.\n     - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Can't reach in one move. So can't eat this now.\n   \n2. **(3,4)**: value=4, life=1\n   - Adjacent to head (4,5)?\n     - (4,5) to (3,4): Left then Down (LD), but can't do both.\n     - Direct moves: From (4,5), to reach (3,4), need to go Left to (3,5), then Down to (3,4) next turn.\n     - Life_span is 1, so disappears after this turn. Can't reach in one move.\n   \n3. **(4,3)**: value=10, life=1\n   - Adjacent to head (4,5)?\n     - (4,5) to (4,3): Down twice, but can't do in one move.\n     - Direct moves: From (4,5), to reach (4,3), need to go Down to (4,4), then Down to (4,3) next turn.\n     - Life_span is 1, so disappears after this turn. Can't reach in one move.\n\n**Conclusion on Food**: None of the foods can be eaten in the immediate next move because their life_span is 1, and they'll disappear after this turn, and none are adjacent to the head's current position for a single move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\nTail is at (2,4). Adjacent to head (4,5)?\n- Adjacent means one step in any direction (including diagonals? No, just U/D/L/R).\n- (4,5) adjacent to (2,4)? \n  - Distance: |4-2|=2, |5-4|=1, so not adjacent (must be one coordinate differs by 1, other by 0).\n- So no adjacency to tail. No danger here.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven that:\n- Up is blocked by a wall.\n- Left and Right are safe but don't lead to food this turn.\n- No immediate food can be eaten.\n- No danger from tail.\n\nBetween Left and Right, which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- If we go Left to (3,5), next moves could be:\n  - From (3,5), direction L (from (4,5) to (3,5) is L), so can't go R next.\n  - Possible next from (3,5): U (3,6), L (2,5), D (3,4) [but (3,4) has food that will be gone by then].\n  \n- If we go Right to (5,5), next moves could be:\n  - From (5,5), direction R (from (4,5) to (5,5) is R), so can't go L next.\n  - Possible next from (5,5): U (5,6) [but (5,6) is wall], R (6,5), D (5,4) [but (5,4) is body].\n     - U: wall\n     - R: (6,5) - not wall, check body: snake body is (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), etc., (6,5) not in body, so safe.\n     - D: (5,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo from (5,5), only safe next is R to (6,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), options seem more open, but no immediate advantage.\n\nAlternatively, is one direction leading towards more open space?\n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's quite long and coiled. Moving Right seems to go towards the right side where there's more space, whereas Left might bring us closer to the body.\n\nGiven that, moving Right might be slightly better to avoid getting boxed in by the snake's own body.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween Left and Right, both are safe, but Right seems slightly better for future movement.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 32\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and anything on these edges is a wall).\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**:\nHead is at (5,5), followed by the body segments in order:\n[(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (3,4) - value: 4, life_span: 1\n2. (4,3) - value: 9, life_span: 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's body to understand possible moves and collisions.\n\nSnake body segments:\n1. Head: (5,5)\n2. Next: (4,5)\n3. Then: (4,4)\n4. Then: (5,4)\n5. Then: (5,3)\n6. Then: (5,2)\n7. Then: (4,2)\n8. Then: (3,2)\n9. Then: (2,2)\n10. Tail: (2,3)\n\nFood:\n- (3,4): positive food (value=4), disappears next turn.\n- (4,3): positive food (value=9), disappears next turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), or Right (R), but:\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately. Current direction is R, so cannot move Left (L).\n- Must avoid walls and its own body (except the tail, which will move away).\n\nSo, possible moves from (5,5) with current direction R:\n- Up (U): (5,6)\n- Down (D): (5,4)\n- Right (R): (6,5)\n\nLeft is not allowed because it's the reverse of current direction R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (5,6)**:\n   - Check walls: y=7 is a wall, (5,6) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Is (5,6) in the snake's body?\n     - Current body positions: all y-coordinates are <=5 except tail is at (2,3), so no.\n   - Safe to move here.\n   - Is there food here? No food at (5,6).\n   - Outcome: Moves to empty space, no score change.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, (5,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Is (5,4) in the snake's body?\n     - Yes, (5,4) is the 4th segment.\n   - Moving into own body is deadly unless it's the tail. Here, (5,4) is not the tail (tail is (2,3)), so this is a collision.\n   - Outcome: Death, so invalid move.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (6,5)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, (6,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Is (6,5) in the snake's body?\n     - No, max x in body is 5.\n   - Safe to move here.\n   - Is there food here? No food at (6,5).\n   - Outcome: Moves to empty space, no score change.\n\nSo, valid safe moves are U and R.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food safely in the next move.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (3,4): value 4, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn)\n   - Current head at (5,5), distance to (3,4):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-3| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n     - Can't reach in one move.\n2. (4,3): value 9, life_span 1\n   - Distance from (5,5):\n     - |5-4| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, no food is reachable in the immediate next move. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move safely towards potential food or to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Towards Food\n\nEven though we can't reach food in one move, we can choose a move that brings us closer to higher-value food.\n\nFood at (4,3) has higher value (9) than (3,4) (4), so let's try to move towards (4,3).\n\nFrom (5,5) to (4,3):\n- Need to decrease x and decrease y.\n- Possible directions: Left (decrease x) or Down (decrease y).\n   - Left is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move Left.\n   - Down is allowed, but we saw that Down to (5,4) is into body, so invalid.\nSo, cannot directly move towards (4,3) in one move.\n\nAlternative is to move Up or Right, then next move can adjust.\n\nBetween U and R:\n- Up (U) to (5,6):\n   - Next moves from (5,6):\n     - Can go Left towards (4,6), but (4,6) is a wall.\n     - Can go Down back to (5,5), but that's reversing.\n     - Can go Right to (6,6).\n   - Not directly helpful for reaching (4,3).\n- Right (R) to (6,5):\n   - Next moves from (6,5):\n     - Can go Up to (6,6).\n     - Can go Down to (6,4).\n     - Can go Right to (7,5) - but x=7 is wall.\n   - From (6,5), moving Down to (6,4) gets us closer to (4,3):\n     - (6,4) to (4,3): need to go Left twice and Down once, but may not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, moving Right may open up more space to maneuver towards the food in subsequent moves.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous?\n\nTail is at (2,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- Up: (2,4)\n- Down: (2,2) - part of body (from snake positions)\n- Left: (1,3)\n- Right: (3,3)\n\nFood is at (3,4) and (4,3). (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3), but not directly adjacent to tail.\n(4,3) is not adjacent to tail.\n\nNo positive food is adjacent to the tail, so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision Between U and R\n\nBoth U and R are safe immediate moves with no immediate reward. \n\n- Moving Up (U) to (5,6):\n   - Moves towards the top edge, which may limit future options.\n   - Not directly helpful for reaching food.\n- Moving Right (R) to (6,5):\n   - Moves towards the right edge but not immediately hitting the wall.\n   - May provide more space to maneuver towards food in subsequent moves.\n\nGiven that, moving Right seems slightly better as it may open up more options next turn.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there any other consideration? \n\n- Food at (4,3) is higher value but can't reach now.\n- Moving Right doesn't block any immediate paths.\n- Moving Up doesn't seem to offer any advantage over Right.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic immediate move is to go **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

No food listed there.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (6,4)**:\n   - Check for walls:\n     - (6,4) is not in internal obstacles.\n     - y=4 is not a border wall.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (6,4) is not in snake body segments → safe.\n   - Food at (6,4)? No food listed there.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nBoth possible moves (U and D) don't lead directly to food. But let's see if moving towards food is possible in future steps.\n\n- Food at (3,4) and (4,3):\n  - (3,4): value 3, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn).\n  - (4,3): value 8, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn).\n\nCurrent head at (6,5). To reach:\n- (3,4): Need to go left and down. Currently moving right, so can't reverse to left immediately.\n- (4,3): Need to go left and down. Similarly, can't go left immediately.\n\nGiven that both foods will disappear next turn and we can't reach them in one move from current position, they're not immediately accessible.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\n- Tail is at (2,2). Is there food at (2,2)? No food listed there.\n- So, no danger from tail food.\n\n### Future Planning\n\nSince both foods will disappear next turn and we can't reach them now, the immediate goal is to stay alive and position for future food.\n\nBetween U and D:\n- Moving U to (6,6):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,6): Assuming direction is now U, can't go D (reverse).\n  - Possible: L (5,6), R (7,6) (invalid due to wall), U (6,7) (invalid due to wall).\n  - So only L is possible next turn, which may limit options.\n  \n- Moving D to (6,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,4): Assuming direction is now D, can't go U.\n  - Possible: L (5,4), R (7,4) (invalid), D (6,3).\n  - More options next turn (L or D).\n\nGiven that moving D offers more flexibility next turn, it seems slightly better.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Body\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that could be eaten if we move away?\n- Current body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2).\n- Food positions: (3,4), (4,3).\n  - (4,3) is adjacent to (4,4) and (5,3).\n    - If we move (4,4) away, and head moves to (4,3), but head is at (6,5), can't reach in one move.\n  - (3,4) is adjacent to (4,4) and (3,2).\n    - Similarly, can't reach in one move.\n- So, no immediate food under body to eat this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth U and D are safe, but D offers more flexibility next turn.

Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n   - Current head direction: Down (D).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (3,4): value=2, life_span=1.\n   - (4,3): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (2,5): value=10, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,4) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- Down (D): (6,3) - but y decreases when going down, so from (6,4), D is (6,3).\n- Left (L): (5,4).\n- Right (R): (7,4) - but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  \nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of current direction D (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, valid moves: D to (6,3), L to (5,4).\n\n### Checking Each Move\n\n**Move Down (D) to (6,3)**:\n- Check if (6,3) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=6 is not a border wall (x=0 or 7), y=3 is not a border wall (y=0 or 7).\n  - Not in internal obstacles: (6,3) is not in [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)].\n  - Not colliding with body: \n    - Snake body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n    - (6,3) is not in these, so safe.\n- Food at (6,3)? No, no food listed there.\n- So, moving D is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n**Move Left (L) to (5,4)**:\n- Check if (5,4) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=5, y=4 are not borders, not in internal obstacles.\n  - Collision with body:\n    - (5,4) is in snake body segments: it's the 6th segment (counting from 0: head is 0, then 1:(6,5), ..., 5:(5,4)).\n    - But the tail is at (3,2), and the segment before tail is (4,2).\n    - When the head moves to (5,4), the tail (3,2) will move away, so the body segment at (5,4) will move to (5,3), and the new tail will be at (4,2).\n    - So moving to (5,4) is safe because the body there will move away as the tail moves.\n- Food at (5,4)? No.\n- So, moving L is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food in the next move or plan to reach it soon.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (3,4): value=2, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten now).\n2. (4,3): value=7, life_span=1.\n3. (2,5): value=10, life_span=1.\n\nCurrent head at (6,4). Distance to foods:\n- (3,4): distance is |6-3| + |4-4| = 3.\n- (4,3): |6-4| + |4-3| = 3.\n- (2,5): |6-2| + |4-5| = 5.\n\nCan't reach any food in one move, but (3,4) and (4,3) are closest. (3,4) has lower value but same lifespan as (4,3). (2,5) is too far.\n\nBetween (3,4) and (4,3), (4,3) has higher value (7 vs 2). Let's see path to (4,3):\n\nFrom (6,4):\n- To reach (4,3), need to go left twice and down once, or down once and left twice.\nPossible sequence: L to (5,4), then D to (5,3), then L to (4,3).\n\nBut both (3,4) and (4,3) disappear next turn, so can't reach them in time unless we can eat one now, but none are adjacent to head now.\n\nWait, current head is at (6,4). Adjacent cells:\n- U: (6,5) - but snake is there (6,5 is body), and direction is D, can't go U.\n- D: (6,3) - no food.\n- L: (5,4) - no food.\n- R: (7,4) - wall.\n\nSo cannot eat any food this turn.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous?\n\nTail is at (3,2). Adjacent to tail:\n- (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2).\nFood at (3,4) - not adjacent to tail.\n(4,3) - adjacent is (4,2) which is part of snake (segment before tail), no food there.\n(2,5) - not adjacent to tail.\n\nNo danger from tail reward.\n\n### Deciding Move\n\nBoth D to (6,3) and L to (5,4) are safe and don't eat food. Which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- If D to (6,3):\n  - Next turn head at (6,3), direction D.\n  - Possible moves: D to (6,2) (but y=0 is wall, y=2 is not), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) (wall).\n  - (5,3) is body (from current position), but next turn tail moves, so (5,3) might be free.\n  - Food at (4,3) is adjacent to (5,3), so maybe can reach it next turn.\n\n- If L to (5,4):\n  - Next turn head at (5,4), direction L.\n  - Possible moves: L to (4,4), D to (5,3), U to (5,5) (but current direction is L, opposite is R, so U is allowed).\n  - (4,4) is body (from current position), but next turn tail moves, so (4,4) is free.\n  - (5,3) is body now, but next turn tail moves, so (5,3) is free.\n  - From (5,4), moving D to (5,3) gets closer to (4,3).\n\nBetween the two, moving L to (5,4) seems better because next turn can move D to (5,3), then L to (4,3) to eat the high-value food (4,3) with value 7.\n\nBut wait, (4,3) has life_span=1, so next turn it disappears. So can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) also disappears next turn.\n\nSo neither food can be eaten in time. Then it's just about moving safely.\n\nBetween D to (6,3) and L to (5,4), both are safe. Maybe L to (5,4) is better because it's moving towards the center where more food might spawn, whereas D to (6,3) is moving towards the wall at y=0.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, both moves are safe, but moving Left seems slightly better for future flexibility.\n\n\\boxed{L}",
