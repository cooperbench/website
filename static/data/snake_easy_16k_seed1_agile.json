It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with direction L, meaning it's facing left. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). The snake is just one segment long, which is the head, since positions are [(3,3)]. That means it's a single cell snake.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive, since value is +1.

Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - something? Countdown starts at life_span and decreases each turn.\n> \n> At the state given, turn 0, food has life_span 10, so countdown is 10. After turn 0, countdown becomes 9, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears after that turn? The description says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if countdown is C, after the turn it becomes C-1, and if C-1 == 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But for planning, since we're at turn 0, with life_span 10, the food will be available for 10 more turns, including turn 0? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn 0, countdown is 10. After turn 0 is executed, countdown becomes 9, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears. So for turn k, if countdown is C, it can be eaten on that turn if head moves to it, and after that, countdown decreases to C-1.\n> \n> But if C=1, after eating or after the turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> For simplicity, since life_span is 10 at turn 0, it will last until turn 9 inclusive, I think. Turn 0: countdown 10, after turn 0: 9, turn 1: 8, ..., turn 9: countdown 1, after turn 9: countdown 0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 0 to turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly for all food, life_span 10, so they last until turn 9.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (3,3), and I need to choose a move for turn 0.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Let's see what each move leads to.\n> \n> If I go Left (L) to (2,3): is (2,3) a wall?

It's turn 1, and the grid has walls and internal obstacles. The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are deadly, I can't move to those cells. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> The snake is just a single segment at (2,3), and the head direction is left (L).

Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, when we see it, life_span is N, meaning it has N turns left including this one? Or after this turn?\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is N, and we are at turn T, then it will disappear after N turns, so it exists from turn T to T + N - 1, and disappears at turn T + N.\n> \n> For example, life_span 9 at turn 1: it exists on turns 1,2,3,...,9, and disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 10: exists turns 1 to 10, gone at turn 11.\n> \n> Since we are at turn 1, all food has many turns left, so I don't need to worry about them disappearing soon.\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> Current position: (2,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (1,3)\n> \n> - U: to (2,4)\n> \n> - D: to (2,2)\n> \n> - R: not allowed, opposite direction.\n> \n> If I go D to (2,2), I eat the food there, since (2,2) has food.

If I go down to (2,2) on turn 1, then on turn 2, I can go down again to (2,1) to eat that food.\n> \n> But (2,1) has food, so I eat it and grow again.\n> \n> But let's see the positions.\n> \n> Turn 1: start at (2,3), move D to (2,2) – eat food, snake now has segments: head at (2,2), tail at (2,3). Length 2.\n> \n> Turn 2: move from (2,2) to (2,1) – eat food at (2,1), so now head at (2,1), and since ate, tail stays, so segments: head (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3)? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, if it eats, the new head is at new position, and the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at head.\n> \n> After turn 1 move to (2,2) and eat: positions [(2,2), (2,3)]\n> \n> After turn 2 move to (2,1) and eat: new head (2,1), previous head (2,2) becomes body, tail (2,3) stays, so positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n> \n> Now, head direction: after moving to (2,1) from (2,2), direction is D (down).\n> \n> Now, from (2,1), I can move?

When I move to (1,1), I didn't eat food, so tail moves.\n> \n> Let's clarify movement:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves to next segment or off if no growth.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to new cell, new segment added, tail does not move.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 2, after moving to (2,1) and eating, positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n> \n> Turn 3: suppose I move L to (1,1). (1,1) has no food, so I move head to (1,1), and tail (2,3) moves off? The segments: head was (2,1), move to (1,1), so new head (1,1). Body segments: previous body (2,2) and (2,3). Since no food eaten, tail moves, meaning the last segment is removed. So positions become: head (1,1), and body (2,1) because (2,2) is now the segment behind head, and (2,3) is removed? Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment, and tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So positions: before move: [head: (2,1), body: (2,2), tail: (2,3)]\n> \n> After move to (1,1) no eat: new head (1,1), body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, so (2,1) becomes body, and (2,2) becomes the next body, and (2,3) is removed since no growth. So positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Now, (2,2) is the tail.\n> \n> From here, I can move U, D, L, R from (1,1).\n> \n> U to (1,2), D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, L to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid, R to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision. So only possible move is U to (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) should be empty.\n> \n> Then move to (1,2), no food, so positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), tail (2,2) removed? After move: new head (1,2), body segments: (1,1) from previous head, and (2,1) from previous body, (2,2) removed. So [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> This is getting messy, and I'm stuck in the bottom left with no easy way to reach other food.\n> \n> Moreover, food at (2,5) is above, but I have to go around, but with walls and obstacles, it might be hard.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (6,6), far away.\n> \n> So going down to (2,2) and then to (2,1) might lead to a dead end quickly.\n> \n> Let's consider other options.\n> \n> I could move up to (2,4) first.\n> \n> Turn 1: from (2,3) move U to (2,4). (2,4) has no food, so snake remains length 1, positions: head at (2,4), tail was (2,3) but since no eat and only one segment, it moves to (2,4)? With one segment, if no eat, moving to (2,4) means the snake is now at (2,4), and no body.\n> \n> Since only one segment, after move to (2,4), positions are just [(2,4)], and head direction U if I moved up.\n> \n> Then turn 2, from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5), which has food!

it.\n> \n> On turn 9 eat F2 at (2,2), then turn 10 move D to (2,1) eat F4, but F3 is gone.\n> \n> So I eat F1, F2, F4, but miss F3.\n> \n> Same as before.\n> \n> To eat F3, I need to be at (6,6) by turn 9.\n> \n> From start, if I go directly to (6,6) without eating other food, I can eat F3 on turn 9 or earlier.\n> \n> For example, turn 1: move L to (1,3) no eat.\n> \n> Turn 2: move U to (1,4) no

if I eat F1 first, then F2 and F4, score +3.\n> \n> But in both cases, I can't eat F3 due to distance and life span.\n> \n> So for maximum score, +3 is possible.\n> \n> Now, to avoid risks, going to the bottom at (2,1) might be risky, but with careful moves, I can escape.\n> \n> In the sequence where I eat F2 and F4 first, on turn 3 I am at (3,1) or something, then move up.\n> \n> As long as I don't get trapped, it should be ok.\n> \n> The internal obstacle at (6,4) doesn't affect if I don't go there.\n> \n> So for the action sequence, I should choose to eat F2 and F4 first.\n> \n> Then F1, and forget F3.\n> \n> But let's confirm the life span.\n> \n> F3 life span 9 at turn 1, disappears at turn 10, so on turn 9 it is there, turn 10 gone.\n> \n> But as calculated, I can't reach by turn 9 if I eat the others.\n> \n> Perhaps I can eat F3 later, but no, life span.\n> \n> Another idea: since the snake is short, I can move to (6,6) quickly without eating, but then I eat only one.\n> \n>

(2,5) is at (2,5), not on the path.\n> \n> If I go to (2,5) first, then I'm stuck.\n> \n> So I think +3 is the best.\n> \n> Now for the action sequence.\n> \n> Let's go with eating F2 and F4 first.\n>

It's turn 2, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at the borders and an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (2,2), then body at (2,3). Since the head direction is down (D), that means the snake is moving downward. The coordinates: (2,2) is head, (2,3) is the segment behind it. If head is at (2,2) and moving down, down would decrease y? Let me clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1)? That might be a mistake. Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but here U is (x,y+1), which might mean y+1 is up if we think of (0,0) as bottom-left. But the walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the food positions.\n> \n> Food is given as (x, y, life_span, value). For example, (2,5,8,1) means at position (2,5), life span 8, value 1 (positive).\n> \n> Snake head at (2,2), body at (2,3). Head direction down (D). D is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y. So if head is at (2,2) and moves down, it goes to (2,1). But body is at (2,3), so after moving, the body will follow to (2,2), and the tail was at (2,3), but since we move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,2), (2,3)] so head at (2,2), tail at (2,3). When snake moves down to (2,1), the new positions become [(2,1), (2,2)], so the tail moved from (2,3) to (2,2), and (2,3) is now empty.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5,8,1) : position (2,5), life span 8, value +1\n> \n> - (6,6,8,1) : (6,6), life span 8, value +1\n> \n> - (2,1,9,1) : (2,1), life span 9, value +1\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 2, life spans are as given. After turn 2, they decrease by 1 each turn.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,2), moving down, so on turn 2, I need to choose an action for turn 2. The sequence should start from turn 2.\n> \n> The action sequence is for turns t1, t1+1, etc., so for turn 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., but I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> First, possible actions from current position and direction.\n> \n> Head at (2,2), direction down (D). Possible moves: I can go down (D), left (L), or right (R), but not up (U) because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Since current direction is down, I cannot move up immediately.\n> \n> So possible moves: D (down to (2,1)), L (left to (1,2)), R (right to (3,2)).\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would be wall collision.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (6,4), but that's not near us now.\n> \n> So from (2,2):\n> \n> - D to (2,1): y=1, which is not 0, so safe from wall. But there's food at (2,1) with value +1.\n> \n> - L to (1,2): x=1, not 0, y=2, safe.\n> \n> - R to (3,2): x=3, not 7, y=2, safe.\n> \n> Now, if I move down to (2,1), I eat the food there, since head moves to (2,1), which has food. Value +1, so snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,3). Head is at (2,2), so adjacent? Adjacent means next to each other. (2,2) and (2,3) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> But when I move to (2,1), the head moves to (2,1), and the tail is still at (2,3) until after the move. After moving to (2,1), the new positions: head at (2,1), body at (2,2). The tail was at (2,3), but since we ate food, the snake grows, so new tail is added, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> When snake moves to a food cell, it eats it, so length increases. The body grows from the tail end.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat food, the next time you move, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to a food cell, during that move, it eats the food, and the growth happens: after moving, a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> For example, here: head at (2,2), tail at (2,3). If I move down to (2,1), which has food, so I eat it. After move, head is at (2,1), and since I ate food, the tail stays at (2,3) and a new segment is added, but the body was at (2,2), so new positions: head at (2,1), then body at (2,2), and tail at (2,3), so snake becomes [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)].\n> \n> Before move: positions [(2,2), (2,3)] head to tail.\n> \n> Move to (2,1), eat food: new head position (2,1), and the body is the previous positions but tail doesn't move, so body segments: previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail (2,3) remains, so [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)].\n> \n> Now, is there a collision? Head at (2,1), body at (2,2) and (2,3). Head is at (2,1), which is adjacent to (2,2), but (2,2) is the body segment immediately behind, but in snake, head can be adjacent to the neck without issue; collision is when head hits a body segment that is not the immediate next one, but typically, head should not occupy the same cell as any body segment except possibly the tail during movement, but here after eating, head is at (2,1) and body at (2,2), which is fine, no collision.\n> \n> But the Tail Reward Danger: it says if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (2,3), which has no food; the food was at (2,1), which head moved to.\n> \n> The danger is when the tail itself has food on it, and head moves to eat that food when adjacent.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (2,3), no food there. Food is at (2,1), separate.\n> \n> So moving to (2,1) should be safe and I get +1 length.\n> \n> But let's confirm the positions.\n> \n> After moving down to (2,1):\n> \n> - Head to (2,1)\n> \n> - Since ate food, tail stays, so positions: head (2,1), then previous head (2,2) now body, and tail (2,3) still tail? No.\n> \n> The segments: before move: segment 0: head (2,2), segment 1: tail (2,3).\n> \n> After move: head moves to (2,1), and since ate food, a new segment is added at the previous tail position or something? I think I have it.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves off old tail, so positions shift.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to new cell, but tail does not move, so snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n> \n> So here: before move: [head: (2,2), tail: (2,3)]\n> \n> After moving to (2,1) and eating: new head (2,1), the body includes the previous head (2,2), and the tail remains (2,3), so now snake is [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)] with head at (2,1), body at (2,2), tail at (2,3).\n> \n> No collision, since (2,1) and (2,2) are adjacent, which is fine.\n> \n> Now, the tail at (2,3) has no food, so no issue.\n> \n> But there is food at (2,1), which I just ate.\n> \n> Now, back to the danger: the Tail Reward Danger is specific: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, head was at (2,2), tail at (2,3), adjacent. But the tail cell (2,3) does not have food; the food is at (2,1). So not applicable.\n> \n> So moving down to eat (2,1) seems safe and beneficial.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. There are other foods: (2,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (2,5) is above, at y=5, head at y=2, so I need to go up.\n> \n> But current direction down, and I cannot reverse instantly, so I need to turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is far.\n> \n> Also, life spans: at turn 2, (2,5) has life span 8, so it will disappear after 8 turns, meaning it exists until turn 10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, food with life span N will disappear after N turns, so it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> Life span: at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it disappears when countdown reaches 0. So if life span is L at turn t, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t, so last chance to eat is on turn t + L - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - On turn t, countdown = N\n> \n> - On turn t+1, countdown = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - On turn t + N -1, countdown =1\n> \n> - On turn t + N, countdown=0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N -1.\n> \n> For (2,5): at turn 2, life span 8, so can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 2+7=9? Turn t to t + N -1.\n> \n> t=2, N=8, so from turn 2 to turn 2+8-1=9.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6): N=8, from turn 2 to 9.\n> \n> (2,1): N=9, from turn 2 to 2+9-1=10.\n> \n> But (2,1) is at turn 2, if I eat it now.\n> \n> Now, snake is small, only 2 segments. After eating (2,1), it becomes 3 segments.\n> \n> But I need to plan multiple moves.\n> \n> Also, the internal obstacle at (6,4) might block paths.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the grid: from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at borders and (6,4) obstacle.\n> \n> So available cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but with obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6 inclusive? x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6 except (6,4) is wall.\n> \n> (6,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Now, foods at (2,5), (6,6), (2,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is below, (2,5) is above, (6,6) is top-right.\n> \n> Snake at (2,2) and (2,3), head down to (2,1) if I choose D.\n> \n> But let's think long-term.\n> \n> If I eat (2,1) now, I grow to length 3, head at (2,1), direction down, since I moved down.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go left to (1,1), right to (3,1), or down to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so down is invalid. y=0 is wall, so from (2,1), down to (2,0) is wall, not possible.\n> \n> So from (2,1), possible moves: L to (1,1), R to (3,1), or U to (2,2).

It's turn 4, and the grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). The snake is at positions [(3,1), (3,2)] with head at (3,1) moving down (direction D). That means the head is at (3,1), and the tail is at (3,2). Since it's moving down, from (3,2) to (3,1), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,1), (3,2)] with head direction D. Direction D means down, so from (3,2) to (3,1) is down, so the head is at (3,1), and it just moved down to (3,1) from (3,2)? Positions are listed head first, so head is (3,1), then the next segment is (3,2), which was the previous head position. Since direction is D, it was moving down, so from turn 3, head was at (3,2), and on turn 4, it moved down to (3,1), so now head is at (3,1), and the body segment is at (3,2). Since it's a short snake, only two segments, tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So on turn 4, each food has its life span as given. After turn 4, life span decreases by 1, and so on.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. Think long-term.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? Borders x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume. (0,0) is bottom-left? Usually in grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left; I need to clarify.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases up or down? Let's see: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if y increases up, then U is up, D is down. But in coordinates, often y=0 is top or bottom? The problem doesn't specify, but from movement, U: (x,y+1) should be up if y=0 is bottom, or down if y=0 is top. I think it's conventional to have y=0 at bottom, so U up increases y, D down decreases y. But in the food positions, (2,5), (6,6), etc., no issue, I can work with coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there. Also internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,1), tail at (3,2). Direction is D, so it just moved down to (3,1). Since it moved down, it cannot move up immediately because of no instant reverse. So from (3,1), possible moves are L, R, or D, but not U.\n> \n> Current position: (3,1)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,1+1) = (3,2) but that's where the tail is. But since the tail will move, is it safe?\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches body segment except the tail, but when moving to tail, it's ok because tail moves. Let me read.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe only if the tail moves away, which it does when the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, if I move U to (3,2), that is currently the tail position. When I move there, the head goes to (3,2), and the tail was at (3,2) but since snake moves, the tail moves to the next position, but there is no next position; it's only two segments. Snake positions: [(3,1), (3,2)], so head at (3,1), body at (3,2). When snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so tail is left.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a new cell, the body segments follow, so the old tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,2), which is current tail, then the new positions: head at (3,2), and the body is at (3,1)? Let's think.\n> \n> Current: segment 0: head (3,1), segment 1: body (3,2)\n> \n> After move: if head moves to new position, say (x,y), then new head at (x,y), and body segments shift: segment 0 moves to (x,y), segment 1 moves to previous position of segment 0, which is (3,1). So new positions: head at (x,y), tail at (3,1).\n> \n> If head moves to (3,2), which is current tail position, then new head at (3,2), and tail at (3,1). So the snake becomes [(3,2), (3,1)], with head at (3,2), and it ate nothing, so length same, but it moved to the tail cell.\n> \n> Is there collision? Head touches body segment: at new position, head at (3,2), body at (3,1), which is different cell, so no collision. Also, since it was the tail, it's safe.\n> \n> But in this case, moving U to (3,2) is safe because after move, tail is at (3,1), head at (3,2), no overlap.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to other places.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,1) with direction D (down):\n> \n> - U: (3,2) - this is up, but direction was D, so U is opposite?

Since it's turn 5, and life span decreases each turn including current, it will disappear after 5 turns? Life span is given as 5, and it decreases every turn. So on turn 5, it has 5 turns left? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

No.\n> \n> The life span is given as the initial life span when it spawned.

In the description: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Since it's turn 5, and life_span is given, I think life_span means the remaining turns before it disappears.\n> \n> For example, (2,5) with life_span=5: on turn 5, it has 5 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So when a food spawns, it has life_span N. On the turn it spawns, countdown is N, and it decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,5), life_span=5, and it's turn 5. If life_span is the current countdown, then on turn 5, countdown=5, so after this turn, it decreases to 4, and so on, until countdown=0 on turn 10? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I need to interpret \"life_span\" as the remaining life in terms of turns left.\n> \n> But the input says \"Life Span\" for the value, and it's a number.\n> \n> Perhaps for simplicity, since it's the current state, \"life_span\" means the number of turns remaining before it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, in the special cases, it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning N turns from now.\n> \n> I think that's the way to go. So for each food, the life_span given is the remaining number of turns it will stay, including the current turn.\n> \n> So on turn t, if life_span = L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn t, if countdown is C, after the turn, it becomes C-1. When C=1, after the turn it disappears.\n> \n> For example: if a food spawns on turn S with life_span N, then on turn S, countdown=N; after turn S, it becomes N-1; ... after turn S + N - 1, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So the number of turns it is present is from turn S to turn S + N - 1.\n> \n> But in the state, we don't have S, we have the current life_span value.\n> \n> In the input, for a given turn, \"life_span\" is the current countdown value.\n> \n> So for food at (2,5), life_span=5 on turn 5. That means on turn 5, countdown=5, so it will decrease to 4 after turn 5, to 3 after turn 6, and so on, until after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, it will be available from turn 5 to turn 9 inclusive? Turn 5: countdown=5, present; after turn 5, countdown=4; turn 6: countdown=4, present; ... turn 9: countdown=1, present; after turn 9, countdown=0, gone for turn 10.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 5,6,7,8,9.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (6,6): life_span=5, value=1, so same as above, available turns 5-9.\n> \n> Food at (5,4): life_span=9, value=1, so available longer, turns 5 to 13.\n> \n> All have value +1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (2,1), body at (3,1), tail at (3,2). So the snake is three segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it was moving left to (2,1) from (3,1)? Positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), then (3,2). So from previous turn, head was at (3,1), moved left to (2,1), so direction is L.\n> \n> Now, current head position (2,1). Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot reverse instantly, so since last move was L (left), I cannot move R (right) this turn.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid has walls on the edges, so playable cells are (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is wall.\n> \n> Now, snake occupies: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2).

(2,2) is not occupied by snake or wall? Snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). (2,2) is empty. Walls: not a border or obstacle, since x=2, y=2, between 1-6, and not (6,4). So (2,2) is free.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,0) – but y=0 is wall, so collision, death. Cannot move down.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,1) – x=1, y=1, not wall (borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so x=1 is ok), and not occupied by snake. Snake is at (2,1),(3,1),(3,2), so (1,1) is free. So possible.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,1) – but (3,1) is the body segment. If I move right, head goes to (3,1), which is currently occupied by the body. But when the snake moves, the body also moves. Let's see the collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, if I move right to (3,1), which is currently the first body segment.

The snake moves: head to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,1), which was the position of the first body segment.

So head moves to (2,5), which has food, so new head at (2,5), and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added where the tail was? Or at the food position?\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous tail position, so length increases by one.\n> \n> After move to food:\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,5)\n> \n> - The body segments move as before: segment 1 to previous head position (2,4), segment 2 to previous position of segment 1, which is (2,3)\n> \n> - But since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, which was (2,2)\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), body (2,3), and new segment at (2,2)\n> \n> So snake is now [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]\n> \n> Length 4.\n> \n> Now, is this safe?

After turn 7, countdown becomes 2. After turn 8, countdown 1. After turn 9, countdown 0, so it disappears before turn 10? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn 7, life span is 3. After the snake moves on turn 7, the countdown decreases by 1 to 2. Similarly, after turn 8, to 1, after turn 9, to 0, and it disappears before turn 10.

So positions: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2) – yes.\n> \n> Now, any danger? At (2,5), it's not adjacent to tail immediately. Tail is at (2,2), which is 3 units away.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, when I eat (2,5), the tail is at (2,2), which is not adjacent to (2,5). Adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (2,4) is adjacent to (2,5), but (2,4) is the body, not the tail. Tail is (2,2).\n> \n> After eating, the new tail is (2,2), which is not adjacent to head (2,5). So no issue.\n> \n> But is there food under the snake? Currently, snake is at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Food is at (2,5), not under snake.\n> \n> Now, but (2,5) might be under body if I move, but not currently.\n> \n> Another thing: after eating, I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> But life span is short, only until turn 9, so I can eat it on turn 8 if I go directly.\n> \n> But let's see other options.\n> \n> Food at (6,6): far away, life span 3, so I need to reach it by turn 9. From (2,3) to (6,6), distance |6-2| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7 moves, which is more than 2 turns (turn 7,8,9), so I can reach by turn 9? Turn 7: move, turn 8: move, turn 9: move to eat. But distance is 7 cells? No, Manhattan distance is |dx| + |dy| = 4 + 3 = 7, so minimum 7 moves. From turn 7, I can move 3 times by turn 9? Let's see:\n> \n> Turn 7: move to some position.\n> \n> After turn 7, it's position after move.\n> \n> Turn 7: I move from current position.\n> \n> At start of turn 7, head at (2,3).\n> \n> After turn 7 action, head at new position.\n> \n> Then turn 8, move again.\n> \n> Turn 9, move to food if possible.\n> \n> But with Manhattan distance 7, I can't reach (6,6) from (2,3) in 3 moves (turns 7,8,9). Minimum 7 moves needed, so impossible to reach (6,6) by turn 9. Since life span 3, it disappears after turn 9, so last chance to eat is on turn 9. But from (2,3) to (6,6) in two moves? |dx| min 4, |dy| min 3, so in two moves I can cover at most 2 in x and 2 in y, say to (4,5), still not close. In three moves, I can reach (6,6) only if I move directly, but obstacles? No direct obstacle, but Manhattan distance 7, so in three moves, I can cover at most 3 steps, so to (5,6) or something, not (6,6). For example, move right thrice: (3,3),(4,3),(5,3) — y not increased. Or up and right, but not enough. So impossible to reach (6,6) by turn 9. Similarly, from any position, it's too far. So food at (6,6) is unreachable before it disappears. Life span 3 at turn 7, so after turn 7,8,9, it's gone. Turn 9 is the last turn it can be eaten, but I can't reach from (2,3) in 3 moves. So I should ignore this food; it's not worth going for.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,4) and (4,5) have longer life span.\n> \n> (5,4) life span 7, so until turn 13; (4,5) life span 10, until turn 16.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate moves.\n> \n> For turn 7, I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Move U to (2,4): closer to (2,5) food, which I can eat on turn 8.\n> \n> Move L to (1,3): left, to x=1,y=3\n> \n> Move R to (3,3): right, to x=3,y=3\n> \n> Now, I need to think long-term.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,4), then on turn 8, I can move U to (2,5) to eat the food.

It's turn 8, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (6,4). The snake is at positions [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] with head at (2,4) and direction Up. That means the head is facing upwards.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 2. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 8, it has 2 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 9? Life span is given as 2, and it decreases each turn, so at turn 8, it has life span 2, meaning it will be gone after turn 9 (since after turn 9, life span becomes 0).\n> \n> Life span: at turn t, life span is N, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it disappears when life span reaches 0. So for food at (2,5), life span 2 at turn 8: after turn 8, it will have life span 1; after turn 9, life span 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 10 or something? I need to be precise.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t + L - 1, it disappears. Let's see:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span = L\n> - After turn t, life span becomes L-1\n> - ...\n> - After turn t + L - 1, life span becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t + L.\n> \n> In the context, for food at (2,5), at turn 8, life span=2, so it will be there for turn 8 and turn 9, and disappear after turn 9 or at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods:\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 2 (same as above)\n> \n> - (5,4): value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (4,5): value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, which is positive.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (2,4), body at (2,3) and tail at (2,2). Since head direction is U, it just moved up to (2,4) from (2,3)? Positions are [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2)], head first, so at turn 8, head is at (2,4), which it just moved to, since direction is U.\n> \n> The snake head direction is given as \"U\", so it is currently facing up. That means it can move up, left, or right, but not down because of no instant reverse. Current direction U, so cannot move D on next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,4):\n> \n> - U: to (2,5)\n> \n> - D: not allowed, reverse\n> \n> - L: to (1,4)\n> \n> - R: to (3,4)\n> \n> But walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid is from x=1 to x=6? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Let's confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, from head at (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,5) - but (2,5) has food? Food at (2,5) is present.\n> \n> - D: (2,3) - but (2,3) is the body segment, and since it's the second segment, when snake moves, the tail will move, so moving to (2,3) might be okay if it's the tail, but let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,4), body (2,3), tail (2,2). If snake moves, say, U to (2,5), then new head (2,5), body becomes (2,4) and (2,3), tail (2,2) becomes part of body, and since it eats food, length increases, so new tail added, positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake moves without eating, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed. When eating, head to food, new segment added at tail, so length increases.\n> \n> But in this case, if it moves to (2,5) which has food, it eats it, so head moves to (2,5), and a new segment is added where the tail was, so positions become [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]? No.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (2,4), index 1: (2,3), index 2: tail (2,2).\n> \n> After move U to (2,5) with eating: new head at (2,5), segment 1 moves to (2,4), segment 2 moves to (2,3), and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at (2,5), then previous head (2,4) becomes body, (2,3) becomes body, and (2,2) is still there, and since eating, a new segment is added, so the tail extends.\n> \n> Typically, the snake moves forward: head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. If no eat, last segment (tail) is removed. If eat, tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So here: before move: positions [H: (2,4), B1: (2,3), B2: (2,2)]\n> \n> Move head to (2,5) which has food: eat, so new positions: H: (2,5), B1: (2,4) [previous head], B2: (2,3) [previous B1], and new tail at (2,2) [previous B2 position, but since not removed, it stays, and new segment added? No.\n> \n> When eating, the tail does not move; it stays in place, and the new head is added, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> Standard: after moving and eating, the body segments shift, and the tail remains, so the new tail is the old tail position, but since a new segment is added, the positions include the new head and all previous segments.\n> \n> Initial: segments S0, S1, S2 at positions P0, P1, P2.\n> \n> After move to new cell N: if N has food, head moves to N, S0 moves to N, S1 moves to old P0, S2 moves to old P1, and a new segment S3 is created at old P2, so positions [N, P0, P1, P2].\n> \n> In this case: old positions: P0=(2,4), P1=(2,3), P2=(2,2)\n> \n> Move to (2,5): new head at (2,5), new segment 1 at old P0=(2,4), new segment 2 at old P1=(2,3), new segment 3 at old P2=(2,2). So positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]\n> \n> Length increased by one.\n> \n> If no food, move to empty cell, then new head at new position, new segment 1 at old P0, new segment 2 at old P1, and old P2 is removed, so positions [N, P0, P1], length same.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (2,4):\n> \n> - U to (2,5): has food, so would eat it.\n> \n> - D to (2,3): but (2,3) is currently occupied by body segment. But in snake, you can move to the tail cell because the tail will move away. Here, (2,3) is not the tail; tail is at (2,2). (2,3) is the second segment, which will become the new tail if we move, but let's see.\n> \n> If we move D to (2,3), which is the current position of the first body segment. After move, if we move to (2,3), and (2,3) is empty? No, it has a body segment, but since we are moving there, and the body will move, it might be okay only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But here, (2,3) is not the tail; tail is (2,2). So moving to (2,3) would cause collision with body, because (2,3) is a body segment that is not the tail.\n> \n> Specifically: deadly collisions include \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" except that you can move to the tail cell.\n> \n> So (2,3) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (2,3) would kill the snake.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (2,2) would be moving to tail, which is allowed only if it's the tail, and tail will move.\n> \n> But in this case, from (2,4), moving D to (2,3) is invalid because (2,3) is a body segment (not tail) and we are moving into it, causing collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any other body cell is death.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,5) - y=5, which is within 1 to 6, and no wall, and it has food.\n> \n> - D: (2,3) - but (2,3) is occupied by body, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (1,4) - x=1, y=4, which is not wall, and empty? No food there, I think. Food are at (2,5), (6,6), (5,4), (4,5), so (1,4) is empty.\n> \n> - R: (3,4) - x=3, y=4, empty, no food.\n> \n> Also, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so (1,4) is ok, x=1 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are free, except internal obstacles. Internal obstacle at (6,4), so (1,4) should be free.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> So (1,4) and (3,4) are free cells.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (2,5) which is directly above.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Currently, head at (2,4), tail at (2,2). Are they adjacent? (2,4) and (2,2) are two cells apart, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> From (2,4), adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,3), (1,4), (3,4).\n> \n> Tail is at (2,2), which is not adjacent to head; it's two cells down. So no issue with tail reward danger for now.\n> \n> If we eat the food at (2,5), which is adjacent and has food, but tail is not involved.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their life spans:\n> \n> - (2,5): life span 2 at turn 8, so after turn 8, life span 1; after turn 9, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 10. So it can be eaten only on turn 8 or turn 9.\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 2, same, disappear after turn 9.\n> \n> - (5,4): life span 6, so lasts until turn 13? At turn 8, life span 6, so after turn 8:5, turn9:4, ..., after turn13:0, disappear before turn14. So can be eaten turns 8 to 13.\n> \n> - (4,5): life span 9, lasts longer.\n> \n> Snake is short, only 3 segments, so growing is good for score and also for survival, but must avoid risks.\n> \n> Now, immediate options at turn 8:\n> \n> 1. Move U to (2,5): eat food, grow to length 4. New positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), tail (2,2).

Since no eat, move to (1,4), new head (1,4), body (2,4) [prev head], body (2,3) [prev body], and tail (2,2) is removed, so positions [(1,4), (2,4), (2,3)], length 3 same.\n> \n> Head direction: moved L, so new direction L.\n> \n> 3.

It's turn 9, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). So it's a vertical snake going upwards, since head direction is U (up). Moving up increases y? Let me confirm the coordinate system. Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so if U increases y, that might imply y=0 is bottom, so up increases y. But in the state, snake positions: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). Head at (2,5), and direction U. If moving U to (x,y+1), that would go to higher y, but (2,5) to (2,4) is decreasing y? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). Since the body segments are below the head, and head is moving U, but (2,5) to (2,4) is down if y increases upwards? I think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Looking at movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, meaning y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. So (2,5) is at y=5, and (2,4) is directly below it at y=4. Head is at (2,5), moving U would go to (2,6), but currently it's at (2,5) with direction U, meaning it just moved to (2,5) from previous position? Snake positions show the current segments, so head at (2,5), and it was at (2,4) before? But direction is U, so it moved up to (2,5) from (2,4)? That doesn't make sense because if it moved up to (2,5), y should increase, but from (2,4) to (2,5) is y increasing, which is up. Positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] so the head is at (2,5), and the tail is at (2,2). Since direction is U, it must have come from (2,4) to (2,5), so moving up.\n> \n> In the sequence, the snake moves: at turn t, head moves to a new cell, body follows. So at this state, turn 9, snake is at positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), tail (2,2). Direction U means it was moving up to get to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,6,1,1) : position (6,6), value 1, life span 1. Since life span 1, it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 9, life span is 1, meaning after turn 9, it will be gone. So it can be eaten only on this turn if head moves there.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span N, it appears for N turns. If life span is 1, it can be eaten only on the turn it appears, and disappears after that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,4,5,1): position (5,4), value 1, life span 5. So it will disappear after 5 turns from now, meaning turns 9,10,11,12,13, gone after turn 13? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 9, life span=5, after turn 9 it becomes 4, after turn 10 it becomes 3, ..., after turn 13 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 9 to turn 13 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5,8,1): position (4,5), value 1, life span 8. So it will be around for 8 turns from now.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food in this state.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,5), direction U (up). Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) next. So allowed moves: U, L, R. D is not allowed because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are accessible, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 1, must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 5\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 8\n> \n> Snake at: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). So the snake is occupying the column x=2, y from 2 to 5.\n> \n> Head at (2,5). Possible actions this turn: U, L, R (since D is opposite and not allowed).\n> \n> If move U: to (2,6). But y=6 is within 0 to 7, but y=7 is wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, it's accessible. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is fine. But (2,6) is a cell, let's see if it's occupied or not.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). So (2,6) is not occupied by snake body. Also, no wall at (2,6), since walls are only at borders and internal obstacles, (2,6) is not border wall, and not (6,4).\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle (6,4). So (2,6) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, if move L: to (1,5)\n> \n> Move R: to (3,5)\n> \n> Now, food at (6,6) must be eaten this turn to get it, since life span 1.\n> \n> But (6,6) is far from (2,5). Distance: from (2,5) to (6,6) is 4 steps right and 1 up, or something. But we can only move one step per turn.\n> \n> To reach (6,6) this turn, we need to be there now, but head is at (2,5), not at (6,6), so we can only eat it if we move to it this turn. But (2,5) to (6,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (1,5), (3,5), (2,6), (2,4) but (2,4) is body, so not possible to move directly to (6,6) from here. So we cannot eat the food at (6,6) this turn; it's impossible. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn, and we lose it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,4) and (4,5) are available for multiple turns.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the immediate actions.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: to (2,6)\n> \n> - L: to (1,5)\n> \n> - R: to (3,5)\n> \n> After moving, the snake body will follow, so the tail will move from (2,2) to (2,3)? When head moves to a new cell, the body shifts, so the segment at (2,4) becomes the new position, etc., and the tail moves away from (2,2), so that cell is free unless it's the head or something.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a new cell, if that cell has food, it eats it and grows, so tail doesn't move, length increases. If no food, tail moves, so the last cell is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, no food at possible move cells yet, since food are at (6,6), (5,4), (4,5), none of which are adjacent to (2,5) except... (4,5) is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (2,5). Adjacent cells: (1,5), (3,5), (2,6), (2,4). (2,4) is body, so cannot move there. (1,5), (3,5), (2,6) are possible, but no food there. So wherever we move, we won't eat food this turn, so snake will move, tail moves, length remains 4.\n> \n> After move, new head position, and body positions.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger about tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows, and head collides with new tail.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (2,2), head at (2,5), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, y diff 1 or same y, x diff 1.\n> \n> (2,5) and (2,2) are not adjacent; (2,5) adjacent to (1,5), (3,5), (2,6), (2,4). (2,4) is body, not tail. Tail is at (2,2), which is two away.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate the options for turn 9.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (2,6)\n> \n> Then new head at (2,6), body: head (2,6), then previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (2,4), then (2,3), tail (2,2). But when head moves to (2,6), since no food eaten, tail moves, so the tail (2,2) is removed, and the new positions are: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). Tail was at (2,2), so after move, segments: head new, then old head (2,5), then (2,4), then (2,3), and (2,2) is vacated.\n> \n> Snake positions become [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n> \n> Direction: since moved U, new direction U.\n> \n> Now from there, possible moves: U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n> \n> U to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, cannot move there. So U not possible.\n> \n> L to (1,6)\n> \n> R to (3,6)\n> \n> Also, food at (6,6) is lost after this turn, so not available.\n> \n> Option 2: Move L to (1,5)\n> \n> Then new head at (1,5), body: (2,5) becomes body, (2,4), (2,3), and tail (2,2) moves? No: head moves to (1,5), no food, so tail moves from (2,2), so positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)\n> \n> Direction: moved L, so new direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (1,5), can move U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L to (0,5) but x=0 is wall, cannot, so L not possible. R to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body, cannot move there. So possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4). Cannot move L or R to wall or body.\n> \n> (1,5) adjacent cells: U (1,6), D (1,4), L (0,5) wall, R (2,5) body, so only U or D.\n> \n> But current direction after move is L, so cannot move R (opposite) immediately? No, instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is now L, after moving L. So for next turn, cannot move R, which is opposite.\n> \n> Possible moves: U or D, since L is current, but R is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So from (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n> \n> Option 3: Move R to (3,5)\n> \n> New head at (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), tail moves from (2,2), so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n> \n> Direction: moved R, so new direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (3,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, cannot, R to (4,5). (4,5) has food! Food at (4,5) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> (4,5) is adjacent to (3,5)? (3,5) to (4,5) is one step right, so yes, adjacent.\n> \n> So if we move R to (3,5) now, then next turn we can move R to (4,5) and eat the food there.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple steps.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (5,4) which might be reachable.\n> \n> First, let's consider the sequence.\n> \n> I need to plan for 5 turns or more.\n> \n> Since the food at (6,6) is unreachable and will disappear, we can ignore it.\n> \n> Now, the key is to eat the other foods while avoiding dead ends or collisions.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls at borders and obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Accessible cells: (1,1) to (6,6) minus (6,4).\n> \n> Food: (5,4) and (4,5)\n> \n> (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, (4,5) at x=4,y=5.\n> \n> Snake at: after any move, but let's start from turn 9.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But currently, tail is moving, so it might not be an issue now.\n> \n> Now, back to options for turn 9.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,6), then I am at (2,6), and can only move L or R, since U to (2,7) wall.\n> \n> But (2,6) is near the top, y=6, which is one below wall y=7.\n> \n> From there, if move L to (1,6), or R to (3,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is corner, might be risky.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is open.\n> \n> But no food nearby immediately.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is at y=5, so from (2,6) or (1,6) or (3,6), it's down.\n> \n> But moving D might be possible after.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,5), I am at (1,5), which is left side, and can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n> \n> (1,4) is available.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to other places.\n> \n> But (1,5) is close to left wall.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,5), I am at (3,5), and next turn I can move to (4,5) to eat the food there, since (4,5) is adjacent and has food.\n> \n> That seems good for immediate reward.\n> \n> But let's see the long term.\n> \n> If I eat (4,5) on turn 10, then snake grows, so length becomes 5, and the food is eaten.\n> \n> But I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, there's (5,4) which is another food.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the sequence starting with R move.\n> \n> Turn 9: move R to (3,5)\n> \n> New positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)  // tail moved, so (2,2) gone\n> \n> Direction: R\n> \n> Turn 10: can move to (4,5) which has food. Move R to (4,5)\n> \n> Eat food, so snake grows: head to (4,5), and tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (4,5), then previous body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and since ate food, a new segment is added, so tail becomes (2,3)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: before move, snake is at [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] length 4.\n> \n> Head moves to (4,5), which has food, so eats it, grows. New head at (4,5), the body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail end gets duplicated or something. Standard snake: when eat food, head moves to new cell, body follows, but since no tail movement, the new position has head at new cell, then all previous segments, and tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> So after eating: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and since grew, tail is now (2,3) but (2,3) was already there? Before move, segments: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,4), 3: tail (2,3)\n> \n> After head moves to (4,5) and eats, new head (4,5), then the previous head (3,5) becomes body, so body segments: (3,5), then (2,5), then (2,4), and since ate, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail was (2,3), now a new tail is added, but it's the same position? No.\n> \n> Typically, when snake eats, head moves to new cell, the body follows, but since eating, the tail doesn't advance, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the position where tail was.\n> \n> So before move: positions: A = (3,5), B = (2,5), C = (2,4), D = (2,3)  // D tail\n> \n> Head moves to (4,5), eats food, so new head (4,5), then A becomes body at (3,5), B at (2,5), C at (2,4), and since ate, D remains at (2,3), but a new segment is added? No: the body consists of the previous positions except that tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So segments: new head (4,5), then previous head (3,5), then previous body segments except the tail is not removed, so (2,5) and (2,4), and the tail (2,3) stays, so positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] length 5.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So now snake at [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n> \n> Direction: moved R, so direction R.\n> \n> Now from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, cannot, R to (5,5).\n> \n> (5,5) is free, I think, no wall or snake.\n> \n> Walls: borders and (6,4), so (5,5) is fine.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,4), which is below.\n> \n> (5,4) is at x=5,y=4.\n> \n> From (4,5), can move D to (4,4) or R to (5,5) or U to (4,6).\n> \n> Cannot move L to body.\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite) next turn.\n> \n> So possible: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, if we move R to (5,5), or D to (4,4), or U to (4,6).\n> \n> We have another food at (5,4), which is adjacent to (5,5) and (4,4), etc.\n> \n> But let's see the state.\n> \n> We need to go to (5,4) to eat it.\n> \n> (5,4) has life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 9 to 13.

It's turn 10, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then body at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3).

Since current turn is 10, it will disappear after turn 10 + 5 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 10, life span 5 means it has 5 turns left including turn 10. After turn 10, it has 4 left, and so on, until it disappears after turn 14? Let me clarify the life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,4) with life_span 5 at turn 10:\n> \n> - Turn 10: life_span = 5\n> \n> - Turn 11: life_span = 4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 14: life_span = 1\n> \n> - After turn 14, it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn 10 to 14 inclusive?

In the state, it's given at current turn, so at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after t + L - 1 or something.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn 10, life_span 5: after turn 10, life_span becomes 4; after turn 11, becomes 3; ... after turn 14, life_span becomes 0, and then it disappears, so it cannot be eaten on turn 15 or later. So it can be eaten from turn 10 to turn 14 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> \n> - (5,4): value 1, life_span 5 at turn 10 → exists until turn 14\n> \n> - (4,5): value 1, life_span 7 at turn 10 → exists until turn 16\n> \n> - (3,1): value 1, life_span 10 at turn 10 → exists until turn 19\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food.

But current head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (3,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): (3,4) to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by the body segment, which is the neck. But according to rules, moving into the tail segment is allowed because the tail will move, but here (3,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment causes collision, except for the tail segment, because when the snake moves, the tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5) - but (3,5) is occupied by the body (neck), so if I move there, it's collision, since it's not the tail. Tail is at (2,4).\n> \n> - D: down to (3,3) - is that within bounds? y=3, min y=1, so (3,3) should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=3 is ok. No obstacle at (3,3).\n> \n> - L: left to (2,4) - (2,4) is occupied by the tail segment. Since it's the tail, and when the snake moves, the tail will move away, so moving to (2,4) should be safe, as long as after move, head and tail don't collide, but in this case, since tail moves, it should be ok.\n> \n> - R: right to (4,4) - (4,4) should be free? Check walls: x from 1 to 6, y=4, so (4,4) is within bounds. Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (4,4) is not (6,4), so free.\n> \n> Now, also, no instant reverse: current head direction is D (down), so I cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from down, I cannot move up on the next turn.\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,4) with direction D, possible moves are: D (down), L (left), R (right), but not U (up).\n> \n> U is impossible because reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> D to (3,3) - possible\n> \n> L to (2,4) - possible, since it's tail\n> \n> R to (4,4) - possible\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 4, value 1, at turn t=11, it will disappear after 4 turns, so at turn 15 it disappears? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current\"\n> \n> At turn t1=11, life span is given, so for (5,4), life span 4, meaning it will disappear at the end of turn 14? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 11, life span is 4, so after turn 11, it decreases to 3, then turn 12 to 2, turn 13 to 1, turn 14 to 0, so it disappears before turn 15? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> Typically, food is available at the beginning of the turn, and if not eaten, life span decreases after the turn.\n> \n> I think it's safe to assume that at turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten on turn t, and if not, at end of turn, life span decreases by 1, and if it reaches 0, it disappears before next turn.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> For (5,4) at turn 11, life span 4, so can be eaten on turns 11,12,13,14. After turn 14, if not eaten, disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 6, so available from turn 11 to 16.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 9, available from turn 11 to 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, which is to the right of head at (3,4), so two steps right.\n> \n> (4,5) is up and right from head? Head at (3,4), (4,5) is x=4,y=5, so right and up.\n> \n> (3,1) is directly below at y=1, x=3.\n> \n> But y=1 is the bottom wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.\n> \n> Now, I need to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. Think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide? Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (2,4), head is at (3,4), so they are adjacent horizontally. Also, is there food at tail? Currently, no food at (2,4), the foods are at (5,4), (4,5), (3,1). So tail cell (2,4) has no food, so no immediate danger.\n> \n> But if I move to the tail, I might eat food if it appears, but currently no.\n> \n> Now, let's think about possible moves.\n> \n> First, immediate options:\n> \n> - Move D (down) to (3,3)\n> \n> - Move L (left) to (2,4) - which is the tail, so safe, but after move, the tail moves, so the cell (2,4) will be free, and snake grows only if eat food.\n> \n> - Move R (right) to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, (3,3) is one step down, no food there.\n> \n> (2,4) is tail, no food, so moving there doesn't eat food, just moves.\n> \n> (4,4) no food.\n> \n> But food is at (5,4), which is east of (4,4), so if I go right to (4,4), then next turn I can go to (5,4) to eat it, but need to check if safe.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is north-east, and (3,1) south.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles: internal obstacle at (6,4), which is east of (5,4), so if I go to (5,4), I might be near the wall.\n> \n> Now, plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> I need to think about the sequence.\n> \n> First, let's consider going for the food at (5,4) since it has short life span, only 4 turns left.\n> \n> Life span 4 at turn 11, so must eat by turn 14.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), (5,4) is at distance 2 in x-direction.\n> \n> If I move right to (4,4) on turn 11, then to (5,4) on turn 12, I can eat it on turn 12.\n> \n> But is (4,4) safe? Yes, as above.\n> \n> Then on turn 12, move to (5,4), eat food, snake grows to length 5.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move that turn, so new positions: after move to (5,4), head at (5,4), body: (3,4) becomes new segment? Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, new head position, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> But in this case, if I move to (5,4) on turn 12, and eat food, then:\n> \n> Turn 11: head at (3,4), positions: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> If move R to (4,4) on turn 11: head to (4,4), then body segments move: (3,4) to where neck was? After move, positions become: head (4,4), then previous head (3,4) becomes first body, then (3,5), then (2,5), and tail (2,4) is left, so new positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: positions: index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (3,5), index 2: (2,5), index 3: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After move R to (4,4): new head at (4,4), then the body segments follow: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, so to (3,4), segment at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, so to (3,5), segment at index 3 moves to where index 2 was, so to (2,5), and the tail cell (2,4) is vacated. So new positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Tail is now at (2,5).\n> \n> Length still 4.\n> \n> Then on turn 12, move to (5,4) to eat food.\n> \n> Move R to (5,4): (5,4) is food, so eat it.\n> \n> New head at (5,4), and since eating, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (2,5), so the tail doesn't move, and new segment at (2,5).\n> \n> So positions: head (5,4), then previous head (4,4) becomes body, then (3,4), then (3,5), then new tail at (2,5)? Let's see:\n> \n> After move: head to (5,4), body: (4,4) becomes first body, then (3,4), then (3,5), and since eating, the tail (2,5) stays, and a new segment is added there, so the last segment is still at (2,5), but now it's part of the body, and the new tail is the segment that was second last? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eating, the head moves to the food, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is created at the old tail position, increasing length.\n> \n> So positions: the new head is at (5,4), the previous positions except the tail are moved, but tail stays.\n> \n> Before move on turn 12: positions [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> After move to (5,4) and eat: head to (5,4), then the first body segment moves to previous head (4,4), second body to previous first body (3,4), third body to previous second body (3,5), and since eating, a new segment is added at the previous tail position (2,5), so the tail is now at (2,5), but it's a new segment?

According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, there's a point about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (5,4), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, to (5,5)), D (down, to (5,3)), L (left, to (4,4)), but (4,4) is the second segment, which is the neck, and moving left would be opposite to current direction?

Head is at (5,5), so (4,5) is left of head? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> Assuming (x,y), x horizontal, y vertical? Direction U is (x,y+1), so y increases up? Usually in grids, y=0 at bottom, but here walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Direction U is (x,y+1), which would be increasing y, so up if y=0 is bottom.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up.\n> \n> In positions: snake head (5,5), direction U, so coming from? Snake positions: (5,5) head, then (5,4), which is down, so it moved from (5,4) to (5,5) up? Positions are given in order: head first, so [(5,5), (5,4), ...] means head at (5,5), previous position (5,4), so it moved up to (5,5) from (5,4).\n> \n> Then from (5,4) it came from (4,4)? Positions: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), so from (4,4) to (5,4) right?

Snake positions include (3,5) as tail, and food is at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the snake's body, as per rules.

Since last move was U (up), I cannot go D (down) next, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So forbidden move: D.\n> \n> Allowed: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see adjacent cells from head (5,5):\n> \n> - Up: (5,6) - but y=6, and walls at y=7, so y=6 is within 1 to 6? y from 1 to 6, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is top row, playable. But is there wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, it's the top row but inside.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> So (5,6) is possible, but need to check for body or obstacles.\n> \n> (5,6): not in snake positions? Snake: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). So (5,6) is free? But also, internal obstacle at (6,4), not (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Down: (5,4) - but (5,4) is the body segment directly behind head, but since we're moving, if I go down to (5,4), that would be collision with body? But the tail might move.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and we move into it, it might be ok because the tail moves.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving into a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment, because when the head moves to the tail, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), (5,4) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Segments: index 0: head (5,5), index 1: (5,4), index 2: (4,4), index 3: (3,4), index 4: tail (3,5).\n> \n> So (5,4) is body segment, not tail. If head moves to (5,4), it would collide with the body part that is currently there, and since it's not the tail, it's a collision. Even after move, the segment at (5,4) would move, but at the moment of move, head is moving to a cell occupied by body.\n> \n> Generally, in snake, moving to a cell that will be free after the move is ok, but the tail is the only one that moves away; other body parts move but the cell might be occupied.\n> \n> Standard snake rule: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the cell that was tail becomes empty, and new tail is added if ate food.\n> \n> But for collision, head cannot move to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, because when head moves to tail, the tail moves, so it doesn't collide.\n> \n> Other body segments: if head moves to where a body segment is, it collides because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) is segment 1, not tail. If I move down to (5,4), that cell is occupied by segment 1, which will move to where segment 2 is or something? After move, segment 1 will move to the new position, but during the move, when head moves to (5,4), the body is still there, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (5,4) is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> From head (5,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): (5,6) - what is here? Not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. So free.\n> \n> - Down (D): (5,4) - occupied by body, not tail, so collision. Also, since last move was U, D is reverse, so forbidden anyway.\n> \n> - Left (L): (4,5) - x=4,y=5. Is this occupied? Snake positions: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). (4,5) not listed, so free? But there is food at (4,5), with value 1, life span 3.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, but it's a cell, so moving there is possible.\n> \n> - Right (R): (6,5) - x=6,y=5. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is playable. Internal obstacle at (6,4), but (6,5) is different. Snake positions? Not there, so free.\n> \n> Now, (6,5) is adjacent to (6,4) which is obstacle, but (6,5) itself is free.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5): U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5). D is forbidden and deadly.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food and risks.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is very close, adjacent left.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,5) is under the tail, but we can eat it only if the tail moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently tail is at (3,5), and food is there, so to eat it, we need to move the tail away first, then head can move there.\n> \n> Life span: food at (4,5) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including this turn 14. So it will be there on turn 14,15,16, gone on turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) life span 6, so on turns 14 to 19, gone on 20.\n> \n> (3,5) life span 9, turns 14 to 22, gone on 23.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,5) with food, but head is at (5,5), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent cells to (3,5) are: (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5)? (4,5) is food, (3,4) is body, (3,6) and (2,5) possible.\n> \n> Head is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to (3,5); they are two apart, so no danger now.\n> \n> But if we move, it might become adjacent.\n> \n> Now, let's consider options for turn 14.\n> \n> Move L to (4,5): eat the food there. Value +1, snake grows.\n> \n> After eating, snake length increases by 1, so new positions: head to (4,5), then body: the current head (5,5) becomes new segment 1, then (5,4) segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, and tail (3,5) remains, but since we ate, we add a segment, so tail stays? When we eat, the tail doesn't move this turn, so snake grows.\n> \n> Sequence: move head to (4,5), which has food, so we eat it. Then the body: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where? After move, head is at (4,5), then the previous position (5,5) is now the new segment 1, then (5,4) is segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, and (3,5) is segment 5, but since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail position, so tail remains at (3,5), and we have a new segment? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell. If no food, tail cell is removed. If food eaten, tail cell is not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> Here, when head moves to (4,5), which has food, so we eat it, so the snake grows. Therefore, after move: head at (4,5), then the previous positions: (5,5) becomes segment 1, (5,4) segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, and (3,5) remains segment 5, and since we ate, no tail removal, so the snake now has segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). Length 6.\n> \n> But (3,5) is the tail, and it has food under it, but the food is still there, I think, until eaten or expired.\n> \n> The food at (3,5) is on the cell, so after snake moves, if the tail moves away, it might be eatable later.\n> \n> But in this move, we didn't eat that food.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,5), and last move was L (since we moved left from (5,5) to (4,5)).\n> \n> Now, possible next moves.\n> \n> But let's think if moving to (4,5) is good.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, so we get +1 score, snake grows.\n> \n> But is there risk? Moving left to (4,5) is safe, no collision.\n> \n> Then from there, where to go.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term.\n> \n> Another option: move U to (5,6). Then no food eaten, snake moves, tail moves away.\n> \n> After move U to (5,6): no food, so head to (5,6), then body: (5,5) becomes segment 1, (5,4) segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, and tail (3,5) moves to where segment 4 was? Tail movement: since no food eaten, the tail moves off (3,5), so new tail is at (3,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> Positions after move: head to (5,6), then previous head (5,5) is now segment 1, (5,4) segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, and (3,5) is no longer part of snake, so tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Snake: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] length 5, tail at (3,4).\n> \n> And food at (3,5) is now exposed, since tail moved away.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,5) is still there.\n> \n> Now, last move was U.\n> \n> Move R to (6,5): no food, so head to (6,5), body: (5,5) segment 1, (5,4) segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, tail (3,5) moves off, so snake: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] tail at (3,4).\n> \n> (6,5) is near the obstacle (6,4), but (6,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 14 choices.\n> \n> Option 1: L to (4,5) - eat food, grow to length 6, head at (4,5), last move L.\n> \n> Option 2: U to (5,6) - no eat, head at (5,6), last move U, tail moved to (3,4), food at (3,5) exposed.\n> \n> Option 3: R to (6,5) - no eat, head at (6,5), last move R, tail moved to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (3,1) which is far, and (3,5) which is near but under tail.\n> \n> First, if I eat the food at (4,5) now, I get +1, but I need to see the future.\n> \n> If I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon, life span 3, so only available for turns 14,15,16.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) has longer life.\n> \n> But (3,5) is under tail, so I need to move tail away to eat it.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,5), so if I move in a way that tail moves, it becomes free.\n> \n> For example, if I move U or R now, tail moves to (3,4), so (3,5) is free with food.\n> \n> Then I can go eat it later.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> Let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, consider moving to (4,5) on turn 14.\n> \n> Turn 14: move L to (4,5), eat food, snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). Length 6. Last move L.\n> \n> Now turn 15: from (4,5), possible moves.\n> \n> Last move L, so cannot go R (reverse).\n> \n> Possible: U, D, L? Directions: from (4,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (4,6) - y=6, top row, free? Not wall, not snake? Snake has (4,5) head, (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). So (4,6) free.\n> \n> - D: (4,4) - but (4,4) is body segment, not tail. Segment 3: (4,4) is the fourth segment?

Also, last move was L, so D is not reverse? Last move was L (left), so reverse is R? Directions: U and D are vertical, L and R horizontal, so reverse of L is R, not D.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction: last move was L, so cannot go R.\n> \n> But D is down, not opposite to L, so can go D, U, or L.\n> \n> But moving D to (4,4) is to body, collision.\n> \n> - L: (3,5) - (3,5) is the tail. Moving to tail is allowed, since tail will move.\n> \n> (3,5) has food, but we can eat it if we move there.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating kills.\n> \n> Here, head at (4,5), tail at (3,5), are they adjacent? (4,5) and (3,5) share x adjacent, same y, so yes, adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> If I move to (3,5), which is tail, and it has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> But since head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it would cause death because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide? Let's see.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (3,5), which has food, so eat it. Snake grows.\n> \n> Positions: head at (3,5), then previous head (4,5) becomes segment 1, (5,5) segment 2, (5,4) segment 3, (4,4) segment 4, (3,4) segment 5, and since ate, tail remains, so (3,5) was tail but now head is there, and since ate, new segment, so tail is at (3,4)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Before move, positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Move head to (3,5): this cell has food, so eat it. Then the body: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where? After head moves to (3,5), the new segments are: head (3,5), then the previous positions except the tail is not removed because we ate.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to new cell and eats, the tail does not move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head (4,5) is now segment 1, then (5,5) segment 2, (5,4) segment 3, (4,4) segment 4, (3,4) segment 5, and the previous tail (3,5) is now occupied by head, but since we ate, we add a new segment at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> The snake segments: after move, head is at new position, each body segment moves to the next position towards the head.\n> \n> So from previous: positions P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 (tail)\n> \n> After move head to new, say N.\n> \n> If no eat, new head N, then P0 becomes new seg1, P1 new seg2, ..., P4 new seg5, P5 removed.\n> \n> If eat, new head N, P0 becomes seg1, P1 seg2, ..., P5 remains as tail, so new segments: N, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5.\n> \n> In this case, previous: P0=(4,5), P1=(5,5), P2=(5,4), P3=(4,4), P4=(3,4), P5=(3,5)\n> \n> Head move to (3,5), which is P5.\n> \n> But (3,5) is occupied by tail, and we move there to eat.\n> \n> After move: head at (3,5), then P0=(4,5) becomes seg1, P1=(5,5) seg2, P2=(5,4) seg3, P3=(4,4) seg4, P4=(3,4) seg5, and since we ate, P5=(3,5) is not removed, but it's now the head position? Conflict.\n> \n> The cell (3,5) had the tail, now head moves there, so it's the same cell.\n> \n> After head moves to (3,5), the tail P5 is still there? But when head moves, the tail should move only if no eat.\n> \n> Because we eat, tail stays, but head is moving to tail cell.\n> \n> So after move, positions: head at (3,5), then the previous segments: P0 to P4 become the body, and P5 is not included because we ate, so P5 is now head.\n> \n> New segments: head (3,5), then P0=(4,5), P1=(5,5), P2=(5,4), P3=(4,4), P4=(3,4), and since ate, no removal, so P4=(3,4) is now the last body segment, and we add a new segment at the end? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake grows when it eats, meaning that after the move, the tail position is not vacated, so the new tail is the previous tail position.\n> \n> But when head moves to the tail position, it's a special case.\n> \n> In this case, head moving to (3,5), which is the current tail.\n> \n> After move, head is at (3,5), and since we ate, the tail does not move, so the previous tail (3,5) is now the head, and the body includes all previous segments except the tail is not removed, so the new snake is: head (3,5), then P0=(4,5), P1=(5,5), P2=(5,4), P3=(4,4), P4=(3,4), and P4 was (3,4), which is now the new tail?

After moving to tail and eating, the head is at (3,5), and the new body is (4,5), etc. down to (3,4) tail.\n> \n> Is there collision? Head at (3,5), and the next segment is (4,5), which is adjacent, no problem. The tail is at (3,4), also adjacent to (4,4)?

Then we move to tail, eat it.\n> \n> After eating, as above, head at (3,5), new tail at (3,4). Are head and new tail adjacent? (3,5) and (3,4) are adjacent vertically. But the head is at (3,5), tail at (3,4), so they are adjacent, but in the snake, the tail is connected to the body, so it's not a collision; it's the normal connection.\n> \n> Collision is when head touches a body segment that is not the immediate next one.\n> \n> Here, after move, head at (3,5), and the body includes (4,5), (5,5), etc., and tail at (3,4). The head is not touching any other body segment; it's only connected to (4,5).\n> \n> (3,5) and (3,4) are both part of snake, but (3,4) is the tail, and (3,5) is head, so the head is adjacent to the first body segment (4,5), not directly to tail. Tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to head (3,5); they are diagonal? (3,5) and (3,4) are adjacent vertically, but in the snake, the tail is not directly connected to head; there is a body in between.\n> \n> Positions: (3,5) head, connected to (4,5), which is left, then (5,5) up? (4,5) to (5,5) is right? x from 4 to 5, same y.\n> \n> From (3,5) to (4,5): that's east, then (4,5) to (5,5) east, then (5,5) to (5,4) south, then (5,4) to (4,4) west, then (4,4) to (3,4) west, then (3,4) tail.\n> \n> So head (3,5) is adjacent to (4,5), but not to tail (3,4).

Since head direction is U, it means the snake was previously at (5,5) and moved up to (5,6).

Turn 18: at (3,4), turn 19: move to (3,3), turn 20: to (3,2), turn 21: to (3,1). But on turn 20, it's already gone, since after turn 19 it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 19: if we are at (3,3), we can move to (3,2) or (3,4) etc., but not to (3,1) directly from (3,3).\n> \n> From (3,5) on turn 17, move D to (3,4) on turn 18.\n> \n> Then turn 19: from (3,4) move D to (3,3)\n> \n> Turn 20: from (3,3) move D to (3,2)\n> \n> But (3,1) disappears before turn 20, so on turn 20 it's not there.

So we cannot eat (3,1) because it's too far south and time is short.\n> \n> (3,1) is at y=1, we are at y=5 on turn 17, need to move down 4 steps to y=1, but from turn 17 to turn 19 is only 3 moves: turn 18,19,20.\n> \n> Turn 17: at (3,5)\n> \n> After turn 17 move: turn 18 to (3,4) or elsewhere\n> \n> Turn 19 to (3,3)\n> \n> Turn 20 to (3,2)\n> \n> But (3,1) must be eaten by turn 19.\n> \n> On turn 19, we are at (3,3) or (3,4), can move to (3,2) or (3,4), not to (3,1). So impossible to reach (3,1) by turn 19; it's 4 cells away in y-direction, but moves are one per turn, so from (3,5) to (3,1) takes 4 moves: to (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So turns 18,19,20,21. But it disappears before turn 20, so last possible eat turn is 19, but on turn 19 we can be at (3,2) if we move directly, but from (3,5) on turn 17, after one move turn 18 to (3,4), after two moves turn 19 to (3,3), after three moves turn 20 to (3,2), after four moves turn 21 to (3,1). So on turn 19, we are at (3,3), which is 2 cells away from (3,1), cannot reach in one move. Thus, we cannot eat (3,1) because we start from (3,5) on turn 17 and it must be eaten by turn 19, but we can only reach (3,3) by turn 19, which is not (3,1). (3,3) to (3,1) is not adjacent, so impossible.\n> \n> Therefore, (3,1) cannot be eaten from this position; it's too late.\n> \n> Life span: must be eaten by turn 19 at latest.\n> \n> But on turn 17, we are at (3,5), distance |5-1|=4 in y, so min 4 moves to reach, but only 2 moves left (turn 18 and 19) to be at (3,1) on turn 19? On turn 19, if we move to (3,1), we eat it, but from where?\n> \n> To be at (3,1) on turn 19, we need to move there from a previous position.\n> \n> On turn 18, we need to be adjacent to (3,1), like (3,2), (2,1), or (4,1).\n> \n> But from (3,5) on turn 17, after turn 18 move, we can be at (3,4) or (2,5) or (3,6), etc. None is adjacent to (3,1).\n> \n> Then on turn 19, from say (3,4), we can go to (3,3), still not adjacent.\n> \n> No way to reach (3,1) by turn 19 from (3,5) on turn 17.\n> \n> Thus, (3,1) is unreachable in time; we should ignore it.\n> \n> Only (4,5) and (3,5) can be eaten.\n> \n> (3,5) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 15: move L to (4,6)\n> \n> Turn 16: move D to (4,5) to eat\n> \n> Turn 17: move L to (3,5) to eat\n> \n> Then on turn 18, from (3,5), we can move, say, D to (3,4) to start exploring south, or U to (3,6), etc.\n> \n> But since (3,1) is gone, we can go for other areas.\n> \n> There might be more food later, but not specified; we have to work with current food.\n> \n> The food given might be all, or we assume no new food spawns? The problem doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so probably only these food are present, and we should eat as many as possible.\n> \n> But (3,1) cannot be eaten, so only (4,5) and (3,5) are eatable for us.\n> \n> We can eat both by the sequence above.\n> \n> But is there a way to eat (3,1)? Only if we go south earlier, but from start, on turn 15, we are at (5,6), which is north, and (3,1) is south, far away.\n> \n> If we don't eat the northern food, we could go south directly.\n> \n> For example, from (5,6), if we could move down, but we cannot because of reverse direction; head direction U, cannot move D.\n> \n> Only L or R, and R is dead end, so must go L to (4,6).\n> \n> Then from (4,6), if we move D to (4,5) we eat and are committed, or move L to (3,6), then we might go south from there.\n> \n> But from (3,6) on turn 16, we can move D to (3,5) eat, or L to (2,6), etc.\n> \n> But to reach (3,1) by turn 19, let's see.\n> \n> On turn 16 at (3,6), move D to (3,5) on turn 16 (eat), then on turn 17 at (3,5), move D to (3,4) on turn 17.\n> \n> Turn 18: move D to (3,3)\n> \n> Turn 19: move D to (3,2)\n> \n> But (3,1) is eaten by moving to it, so on turn 19, from (3,2) move to (3,1)?

Life span: at turn 19, it has life span 1? Life span 5 at turn 15, after turn 15:4, turn16:3, turn17:2, turn18:1, so on turn 18 it has life span 1, present; turn 19, after move, it decreases to 0, but during turn 19 it is present, so can be eaten on turn 19.\n> \n> On turn 19, we are at (3,3), can move to (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3), not directly to (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is two cells away, cannot reach in one move.\n> \n> From (3,3) on turn 19, move to (3,2), then on turn 20, move to (3,1), but (3,1) disappears after turn 19, so not present on turn 20.

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 16, life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,5) with life span 1 on turn 16, it means it will be gone by turn 17. So it can be eaten on turn 16 only.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) value 1, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's see: on turn 16, life span 4, so it decreases to 3 on turn 17, 2 on 18, 1 on 19, gone on 20?

The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it will be present for N more turns, including the current one if not eaten.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if life_span is L at turn t, it will be available until turn t + L - 1, and gone at turn t + L. But the countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at the start of turn t, life_span is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten during turn t when life_span is still L.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,5): at turn 16, life_span=1, so after turn 16, it will be gone. So it must be eaten on turn 16 or never.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life_span=4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning after turn 19, gone on turn 20.\n> \n> (3,5): life_span=7, value 1\n> \n> (3,6): life_span=10, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,6), direction left.

Let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells: snake positions and walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle (6,4).\n> \n> So grid cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3, y=5. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4). None at (3,5). Walls: no wall at (3,5), since walls are borders and (6,4). So (3,5) should be free.\n> \n> - R: to (5,5) - occupied by segment 3, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied, so I can't move there.\n> \n> Now, D to (4,4): tail is there, but tail will move, so it might be ok.\n> \n> But when I move, the snake moves: head goes to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed if not growing.\n> \n> Since I'm eating food or not? Moving to a cell with food: (4,4) has no food? Food positions: (3,1), (3,5), (3,6). None at (4,4), so if I move to (4,4), I don't eat food, so snake doesn't grow, tail moves away.\n> \n> So if I move to (4,4), head goes to (4,4), which was tail, but tail moves to the previous position of segment 4 or something. Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [ (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n> \n> If I move D to (4,4):\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,4)\n> \n> - Then the body: segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,5)?

No.\n> \n> When eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; we add a new segment at the tail position.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, body follows, tail removed.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to new cell, body follows, but tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In positions: when eat, new head position is the food cell, and the body segments move to previous positions, but since tail doesn't move, the position before tail is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Easier: after move to food, the snake has the new head at food cell, and all previous segments, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, current positions: [A(head), B, C, D, E(tail)]\n> \n> Move to F (food): new positions [F(head), A, B, C, D, E] — so E is still tail, but now it's segment 5, and we have new segment at A position?

Since head is at (4,4) and moving down, which is towards decreasing y, so from (4,4) down would be to (4,3), but (4,4) to (4,3) is down? y decreases as we go down, I think. Standard coordinates: usually (0,0) top-left, y increasing down, x increasing right. But in the movement, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increasing up or down? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — so if y+1 is up, then y=0 is top, but it says U (x,y+1), and D (x,y-1). Typically in grid games, y=0 is top, so U (up) would decrease y, but here U is (x,y+1), so if y+1, that means y increasing is down? I think I need to confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> It says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> And walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Also, in snake positions, head is (4,4), and direction is D (down). Since it's moving down, and D is (x,y-1), so from (4,4) to (4,3) would be down, meaning y decreases as we go down. So y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom.\n> \n> U (x,y+1) would be increasing y, so down? That can't be right. U should be up.\n> \n> Inconsistency: U is (x,y+1), but if y increases down, then (x,y+1) is down, which should be D. But D is (x,y-1), which would be up if y increases down.\n> \n> I think there's a confusion in coordinate system.\n> \n> Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`\" — so U means moving to a point where y is increased by 1.\n> \n> But in standard grid, if (0,0) is top-left, moving up decreases y, moving down increases y.\n> \n> Here, U (x,y+1) — y+1, so if (0,0) top, y+1 is down, so U would be down, but that contradicts the label \"U\" for up.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system has (0,0) at bottom-left.\n> \n> But it says walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is one side, y=7 the other.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's look at the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> Head at (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), so from (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6) — y is increasing: 4 to 5 to 6. Since head direction is D, down, but from (4,4) to (4,5) is increasing y, which should be down if y increases downward.\n> \n> Direction is given as D, but the positions show movement from head to body: head (4,4), next is (4,5), which is (x, y+1), so that would be U if U is (x,y+1), but direction is D?

Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,4), then body (4,5), (4,6), etc. So the head is at (4,4), and the previous position was (4,5)? No, the list is from head to tail, so head is first, then the segment behind it, and so on to tail.\n> \n> So snake positions: index 0: head (4,4), index 1: (4,5), index 2: (4,6), index 3: (5,6), index 4: (5,5), index 5: (5,4)\n> \n> So the head is at (4,4), and the next segment is (4,5), which is directly above if y increases down, so (4,5) has higher y, so lower position if y=0 top, but let's assume y=0 is top for simplicity, so (4,5) is below (4,4) if y increases down.\n> \n> I think I need to define the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the movement: U (x,y+1) — if U is up, then (x,y+1) should have lower y if y=0 top, but it's y+1, so it must be that y increases as we go down.\n> \n> So standard: (0,0) top-left, x right, y down.\n> \n> So U (x,y+1) : y+1 means down, so U is down?

Obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,5), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5). So, plotting this:\n> \n> - (3,5): head\n> \n> - (3,4): body\n> \n> - (4,4): body\n> \n> - (4,5): body\n> \n> - (4,6): body\n> \n> - (5,6): body\n> \n> - (5,5): tail\n> \n> Head direction Up, so it moved from (3,4) to (3,5) last turn?

After move, the tail will move, so let's see what happens.\n> \n> If I move to (3,4), that's where the neck is, so it would collide immediately, I think.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Current positions: head (3,5), then (3,4) is next, which is the first body segment.\n> \n> If I move Down to (3,4), that cell is currently occupied by the body, and since the snake moves, the head would move to (3,4) at the same time as the body segments shift. But when the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n> \n> The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" except that you can move to the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (5,5).

(2,5) is not a wall; walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=2,y=5 should be fine, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,5),(3,4),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(5,5) – (2,5) not listed, so should be empty.\n> \n> - R: to (4,5) – but (4,5) is a body segment, occupied. So moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> (4,5) is the fourth segment: positions index: 0:head (3,5), 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,5), 4:(4,6), 5:(5,6), 6:tail (5,5)\n> \n> So (4,5) is position 3, a body segment, not tail. So moving to (4,5) would be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (3,4) is position 1, collision, and also impossible because reverse direction.\n> \n> So only possible moves from current position:\n> \n> - U to (3,6)\n> \n> - L to (2,5)\n> \n> R and D are invalid or deadly.\n> \n> Now, (3,6) has food, which is positive, value 1.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), I eat the food. Then snake grows by one, so new head at (3,6), and the tail doesn't move? When you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the head is at food, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place for that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So, if head moves to food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, meaning that after the move, the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Then next turn, when moving, the tail will move as usual.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to food, the body moves such that the tail remains, and a new segment is added where the tail was? Standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> Typically: when snake eats food, it moves forward, head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, but since it grows, the tail doesn't shorten; it stays, so new length.\n> \n> For example, if snake is at positions [A,B,C], head A. Move to food at D, then new positions [D,A,B,C], so C is still there, new segment.\n> \n> In this case, current positions: let's list with indices.\n> \n> Turn t: positions: [H, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, T] = [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n> \n> If move U to (3,6), which has food. Eat food, so new head at (3,6), then body: previous head to body, so [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] and since it grew, tail stays at (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, now it's part of body, and new tail is (5,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> After eating: the head moves to (3,6). The body segments shift: B1 moves to where head was, (3,5), B2 moves to where B1 was, (3,4), and so on, up to B5 moves to where B4 was, which is (4,6)? Positions:\n> \n> Current: index 0: (3,5) H, 1: (3,4) B1, 2: (4,4) B2, 3: (4,5) B3, 4: (4,6) B4, 5: (5,6) B5, 6: (5,5) T\n> \n> After move to (3,6) and eat food:\n> \n> Head moves to (3,6). Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. So B1 moves to old H (3,5), B2 moves to old B1 (3,4), B3 moves to old B2 (4,4), B4 moves to old B3 (4,5), B5 moves to old B4 (4,6), T moves to old B5 (5,6). But since it grows, we add a new segment at the old tail position? No.\n> \n> When eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> Standard: after moving head to new cell with food, all segments shift, but since length increases, the last position (tail) is not removed; instead, it stays, and the new head position is added.\n> \n> So positions become: new head at (3,6), then old head (3,5) becomes new B1, old B1 (3,4) becomes new B2, ..., old B5 (5,6) becomes new B6, and old tail (5,5) becomes new B7? Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: 0:H, 1:B1, 2:B2, 3:B3, 4:B4, 5:B5, 6:T\n> \n> After eating and moving to (3,6):\n> \n> - New head: (3,6)\n> \n> - New B1: old H (3,5)\n> \n> - New B2: old B1 (3,4)\n> \n> - New B3: old B2 (4,4)\n> \n> - New B4: old B3 (4,5)\n> \n> - New B5: old B4 (4,6)\n> \n> - New B6: old B5 (5,6)\n> \n> - New tail: old T (5,5) — since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so old tail position is now the second last, and we have a new segment at the position where tail was? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think: when the snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position of the tail, so the tail stays in place, and the new segment is attached.\n> \n> In terms of positions: the body shifts such that the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added after it? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail position is vacated.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to position of previous segment, but tail position is not vacated; it stays occupied, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So, after move with eat:\n> \n> - New positions: [new_head, old_head, old_B1, old_B2, ..., old_Bk, old_tail]\n> \n> For k body segments.\n> \n> In this case, old positions: H, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, T\n> \n> After moving head to (3,6) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (3,6)\n> \n> - New B1: old H (3,5)\n> \n> - New B2: old B1 (3,4)\n> \n> - New B3: old B2 (4,4)\n> \n> - New B4: old B3 (4,5)\n> \n> - New B5: old B4 (4,6)\n> \n> - New B6: old B5 (5,6)\n> \n> - New tail: old T (5,5)  // since tail didn't move, it becomes part of the body, and the new tail is the last segment, which is still (5,5)? No.\n> \n> Old T is at (5,5). After the move, since we eat, the tail doesn't move, so the cell (5,5) is still occupied by the tail, and the new segment is added, but in the list, the positions are: new head at (3,6), then the old positions are shifted, with the tail remaining.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,6), then body: (3,5) - which was head, (3,4) - B1, (4,4) - B2, (4,5) - B3, (4,6) - B4, (5,6) - B5, and tail still at (5,5).

Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,6), and body segments: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5). Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (1,4) with value 1 and life span 8. Since it's turn 21, and life span decreases every turn including current, so after turn 21, life span becomes 7, then 6, etc., until it disappears after 8 turns from now? Life span is given as 8 at turn 21, so it will disappear after turn 21 + 8 - 1? Let me clarify the life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: disappears (no longer present)\n> \n> In this case, food at (1,4) has life span 8 at turn 21. So it will be present on turns 21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. It disappears on turn 29.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,6), direction U. Possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, R, but not D, because of no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D immediately. Allowed moves are U (same), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly y from 1 to 6 inclusive? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so yes, playable area is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Confirming: for example, snake head is at (3,6), which is y=6. Since y=7 is wall, but (3,6) is playable because y=6 is not y=7. Similarly, (1,4) is within 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to understand the shape.\n> \n> Head: (3,6)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n> \n> So the snake is: from head down to (3,4), then right to (4,4), up to (4,5), up to (4,6)? (4,4) to (4,5) is up, then (4,5) to (4,6) is up? But (4,6) is at same y as head? Let's plot:\n> \n> - (3,6) - head\n> \n> - (3,5) - below head? Since head is at (3,6), direction U, but positions are given in order, so (3,6) to (3,5) is down, but head direction is U, meaning it was moving up to get to (3,6)? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n> \n> So, head at (3,6), then next is (3,5), so the snake was moving down to (3,6)? But head direction is given as U. Head direction is the direction it is currently facing or the last move direction?\n> \n> Head direction is specified as U, which means the snake is oriented upwards, so from (3,5) to (3,6) was an upward move, I think. Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (3,6) head\n> \n> Index 1: (3,5) — so this is the segment behind the head, so the head moved from (3,5) to (3,6), which is up, since y increased from 5 to 6. So yes, head direction U means it just moved up to current position.\n> \n> Then next segment is (3,4), so from (3,4) to (3,5), then to head.\n> \n> Then (4,4) — how is this connected? (3,4) to (4,4) is right, then (4,4) to (4,5) is up, then (4,5) to (4,6) is up, then (4,6) to (5,6) is right? Positions: after (3,4) is (4,4), so from (3,4) to (4,4) is east, then (4,4) to (4,5) is north, (4,5) to (4,6) is north, then (4,6) to (5,6) is east, then (5,6) to (5,5) is south? (5,6) to (5,5) is south.\n> \n> But (5,5) is the tail? List with indices:\n> \n> 0: (3,6) head\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,4)\n> \n> 3: (4,4)\n> \n> 4: (4,5)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (5,6)\n> \n> 7: (5,5) tail\n> \n> So the snake body: from head (3,6) to (3,5) down, to (3,4) down, to (4,4) east, to (4,5) north, to (4,6) north, to (5,6) east, to (5,5) south. So tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, food at (1,4) with value +1, life span 8.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see possible moves from current position (3,6) with direction U.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, L, R (since no D, reverse not allowed).\n> \n> - U: up to (3,7) — but y=7 is wall, so (3,7) is invalid, collision with wall. Cannot move U.\n> \n> - L: left to (2,6)\n> \n> - R: right to (4,6)\n> \n> But (4,6) is occupied by the snake body? Positions: (4,6) is index 5 in the list, which is a body segment. But let's see if it's safe.\n> \n> The rule about body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move. Specifically, it says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, if I move to a cell that will be occupied by the tail after movement, it's ok.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> So for a move to be safe:\n> \n> - The new head position must not be a wall or a body segment, except if it is the current tail position, because after move, the tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: not allowed, reverse direction\n> \n> - L: (2,6) - what is there? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Cells: (2,6) - is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5). So (2,6) is not in the list, so empty? But is it within bounds? x=2, y=6, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, so (2,6) is playable and empty.\n> \n> - R: (4,6) - now, (4,6) is occupied by the snake body at index 5. But is this the tail? Tail is at (5,5), not (4,6). (4,6) is a body segment, not tail. So moving to (4,6) would cause collision with body, since head touches (4,6) which is not tail.\n> \n> After move, if head moves to (4,6), which is currently occupied, but since it's not the tail, it will still be there when head arrives, so collision.\n> \n> The only exception is if moving to the tail cell.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (5,5), so (4,6) is not tail.\n> \n> Therefore, moving R to (4,6) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U to (3,7) is wall.\n> \n> Moving D is not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (2,6).\n> \n> Is that right? What about other directions? Only L, R, U possible, but U and R invalid, so only L is possible?\n> \n> But let's confirm: head at (3,6), direction U, so can move U, L, R.\n> \n> U: (3,7) wall, die.\n> \n> R: (4,6) occupied by body (index 5), not tail, so collision, die.\n> \n> L: (2,6) empty, no wall, so safe.\n> \n> But is there a down move? No, because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So from current position, only possible safe move is L to (2,6).\n> \n> Then after that, the snake will move, head to (2,6), tail moves, so tail was (5,5), which will move to where? When head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so the body shifts.\n> \n> After move to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), then the old head becomes body, so (3,6) becomes segment 1, then (3,5) seg2, (3,4) seg3, (4,4) seg4, (4,5) seg5, (4,6) seg6, (5,6) seg7, and tail (5,5) is gone? Positions: new head (2,6), then previous positions except tail: so body: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). (5,6) was index 6, now becomes the second last? Let's list: after moving left to (2,6), the snake becomes: head at (2,6), then the first body segment is the old head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), and (5,6) — but (5,6) was index 6, and tail was (5,5), which is removed, so the new tail is (5,6)? Positions: original 8 segments.\n> \n> After move, head moves to new position, so new head (2,6), then the previous segments from index 0 to 7, but index 7 is tail, which is removed, so the body is indices 0 to 6 shifted: so segment 1 becomes new body index 1: (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), and (5,6) becomes the new tail? Original indices:\n> \n> 0: (3,6) head\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,4)\n> \n> 3: (4,4)\n> \n> 4: (4,5)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (5,6)\n> \n> 7: (5,5) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (2,6), new head is (2,6), then the body is: old head (3,6) as first body segment, then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), and (5,6). (5,6) was index 6, now it becomes the last body segment, and (5,5) is removed. So tail is now (5,6).\n> \n> New positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] so tail at (5,6).\n> \n> Head direction: since we moved left, new head direction is L.\n> \n> Now, food is at (1,4), which is not eaten yet.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> But currently, only one move possible: L to (2,6).\n> \n> Then from there, I can plan further.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and possible paths to food.\n> \n> Food at (1,4), head at (3,6), after move to (2,6), head at (2,6).\n> \n> From (2,6), possible moves: current direction L (since just moved left), so can move L, U, D?

Let's see snake positions after move: as above, snake at (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), etc., so (1,6) not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> - U to (2,7): but y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (2,5): (2,5) is not occupied, empty? Yes.\n> \n> - R to (3,6): but (3,6) is occupied by body, and it's not tail? After move to (2,6), (3,6) is the first body segment, so moving R to (3,6) would be collision, since (3,6) is body and not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6), so (3,6) is not tail, so cannot move R.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (2,7) wall.\n> \n> So possible from (2,6): L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, food is at (1,4), so I need to get to (1,4).\n> \n> From (2,6), to (1,4), I need to go down and left.\n> \n> But (1,4) is at y=4, x=1.\n> \n> Current y=6, so need to decrease y.\n> \n> Also, there is an internal obstacle at (6,4), but that's far, not relevant now.\n> \n> Life span of food: 8 turns from turn 21, so until turn 28.\n> \n> Turn 21: current, we move to (2,6) on turn 21?

Snake: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6) tail.\n> \n> Turn 22: suppose we move L to (1,6). Then head (1,6), body: old head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), and (5,6) tail? Positions: after move, head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Tail (4,6)? Original body after turn 21: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] so when move to (1,6), new head (1,6), body: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), and tail (5,6) removed? Segments: old head (2,6) becomes first body, then (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), and (5,6) is the last, so tail is (5,6). After move, new positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) — so tail at (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) was index 6 in previous, but after adding new head, the last body segment is (4,6), since (5,6) was tail and is removed. Previous positions: 8 cells. After move, head new, then the first 7 body segments from previous, but the last one is not included?

After eating, moving down to (1,3) and right to (2,3) avoids corner traps and positions the snake centrally for long-term survival in the 6x6 grid with the obstacle at (6,4).\n",

It's turn 22. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the edges plus that one internal wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (2,6) from (3,6)? Let's see the positions: the head is (2,6), and previous was (3,6), so yes, it moved left to (2,6).\n> \n> Food: there are two pieces:\n> \n> - At (1,4) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - At (6,2) with life span 10 and value 1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake: positions in order: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6).

No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn.

Snake positions: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). So (1,6) is free? Also, walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> But is (1,6) a wall? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is fine. y=6, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=6 is fine.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), not here.\n> \n> So (1,6) is empty.\n> \n> Down: (2,5) – is it free? Not in snake positions, not wall, so yes.\n> \n> Up: (2,7) – y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Right: (3,6) – occupied by body segment 1, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,6) at turn 22: L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Food locations: (1,4) with life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns from now?

Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn 22, life_span=7, so it will disappear at the end of turn 22 + 6? After N turns means after N steps.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life_span L, it will be there until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only on this turn.\n> \n> If L=2, it disappears after next turn, so can be eaten on turn t or t+1.\n> \n> Generally, food with life_span L at turn t can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> Here, turn 22, food at (1,4) life_span 7, so it can be eaten from turn 22 to turn 22 + 6 = 28? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 22: life_span 7, countdown decreases to 6 after this turn? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> At the start of turn, food has remaining life.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life_span L, meaning after this turn, life_span becomes L-1, and so on, until life_span 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So, it can be eaten as long as life_span > 0.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t, and after that, if not eaten, life_span becomes L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until turn t + L - 1, where life_span=1, can be eaten, then after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So, for (1,4), life_span=7 at turn 22, so it can be eaten from turn 22 to turn 28 (since 22 + 7 - 1 = 28?).\n> \n> Turn 22: L=7, can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn 22, L=6 for turn 23.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 28, L=0, disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 28.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,2) life_span=10, so can be eaten from turn 22 to turn 31.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (5,6), and no food there, so not an immediate issue.\n> \n> Now, let's see the snake body.

Earlier I said segment 7 is (4,5), but positions: new snake: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)] so (1,6) is the first body segment.\n> \n> If I move U from (1,5) to (1,6), that is occupied by the body, specifically the neck, which would cause collision.

It's turn 24. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). Head direction is down, which is D. So moving down.\n> \n> Food: there are two positive foods, both with value +1 and life span: (1,4) with life 5, and (6,2) with life 8. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, for (1,4), it has 5 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 28 (24+4, since it decreases on turn 24,25,26,27, gone after 28? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, life span L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t+N-1, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n> \n> For (1,4) at turn 24, life span 5, so it can be eaten on turns 24,25,26,27,28. After turn 28, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 8, can be eaten from turn 24 to 31.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,5) with direction D (down). Moving down from (1,5) would go to (1,4), but (1,4) has food. So if I move down now, I eat the food at (1,4).\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (1,5): head\n> \n> - (1,6): body\n> \n> - (2,6): body\n> \n> - (3,6): body\n> \n> - (3,5): body\n> \n> - (3,4): body\n> \n> - (4,4): body\n> \n> - (4,5): tail? Positions are given in order: index 0 head, 1 to 7 body, but last one is tail. Snake positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. So (1,5) head, (4,5) tail. Length is 8 segments.\n> \n> When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves away, head moves to new position. If it eats, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down. So current move options: from (1,5), moving down to (1,4), left to (0,5) but x=0 is wall, so invalid. Right to (2,5)? (2,5) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). So (2,5) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Coordinates: (2,5) not in the list, so free. Similarly, up: from (1,5) up would be (1,6), but (1,6) is the second segment, which is body. Moving into body is collision, deadly, unless it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's clarify movement and collision.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,5). When snake moves, tail moves to the next position, but only if no growth.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,5) with direction D (down):\n> \n> - Down: to (1,4). Is (1,4) occupied? Snake positions: (1,5) head, (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). (1,4) is not listed, so it should be free, except for food. Food at (1,4) is present, so moving to (1,4) would eat the food.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,5). But x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,5). (2,5) not occupied, no wall, so possible.\n> \n> - Up: to (1,6). (1,6) is a body segment. Since head is moving to (1,6), and (1,6) is not the tail, it's a body segment that will still be there after move, so collision. Deadly, cannot move up.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so moving up would be reverse, but rule says \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. But here, moving up is opposite to down, so it's invalid anyway due to no reverse rule.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so cannot move U on this turn.\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R, but L to (0,5) wall, invalid. So only D or R.\n> \n> D to (1,4), R to (2,5).\n> \n> If I move D to (1,4), I eat the food at (1,4), since it's positive food, +1 score, snake grows, so new length 9, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> After eating, snake positions: head now at (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) and new segment? When eating, head moves to food, new head is (1,4), and a new segment is added where the tail was, but tail was at (4,5), but since it grows, tail stays, so the segment before tail becomes new tail or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eats, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, and snake grows by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (1,4), then previous head (1,5) becomes second segment, then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), and new tail at (4,5)? No.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (1,5) head, 1: (1,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (1,4) and eating: head moves to (1,4), then the body: the first body segment is now (1,5), which was head, then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), and since eating, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays at (4,5), but new segment is added, so now tail is still (4,5), and a new segment before that? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better: after move and eat, the head is at new position (1,4), the previous head (1,5) is now part of body, and all segments remain, but since growth, a new segment is added at the position where tail was, so the tail doesn't move. So new positions: head (1,4), body segments: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), and tail (4,5) with new segment? No.\n> \n> Positions: the snake grows by adding a new segment at the end, so the tail position stays the same for that turn, and next turn when it moves, the tail might move or not.\n> \n> In terms of positions after eat: the head is at (1,4), then the body includes all previous positions except the tail might stay or something.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, it moves to the food cell, and the tail does not advance, so the snake effectively grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (1,4), then the previous positions: (1,5) is now first body, (1,6) second, ..., up to (4,4) which was second last, and (4,5) is still tail, but since it didn't move, it remains, and because of growth, there is an additional segment at (4,5)? No, (4,5) was tail, and it stays, so the new tail is still at (4,5), but the snake is longer.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier: the segment that was tail remains tail, and a new segment is added there, but since it didn't move, it's the same cell.\n> \n> After eating, the cell that was tail is still occupied, and head is at new position, so all cells from previous snake are occupied, plus the new head position, but the tail cell is not vacated.\n> \n> In this case, after moving down to (1,4) and eating: cells occupied: (1,4) head, (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) tail. So all previous cells except head moved, but head moved to (1,4), and tail stayed, so positions: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — 9 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if not eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> But here, if I move to (1,4), I eat the food.\n> \n> Now, (1,4) has food, and it's positive, so +1 score, snake grows to 9.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, is head adjacent to tail? Head at (1,5), tail at (4,5). Are they adjacent? (1,5) and (4,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up/down/left/right. (1,5) to (4,5) is not adjacent; they are 3 cells apart in x-direction. So not adjacent. Therefore, no danger from that.\n> \n> So moving down to (1,4) seems safe and I get food immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there's another food at (6,2) with life 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> If I move right to (2,5), I don't eat anything, snake moves, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,5), so if I move to (2,5), new head (2,5), then body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), and tail (4,5) moves to where? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> Original positions: 0:(1,5) head, 1:(1,6), 2:(2,6), 3:(3,6), 4:(3,5), 5:(3,4), 6:(4,4), 7:(4,5) tail.\n> \n> If move right to (2,5), new head at (2,5), then body segments: segment 1 moves to previous head (1,5), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 (1,6), segment 3 to previous segment 2 (2,6), segment 4 to previous segment 3 (3,6), segment 5 to previous segment 4 (3,5), segment 6 to previous segment 5 (3,4), segment 7 to previous segment 6 (4,4), and tail (segment 7) was at (4,5), but it moves to where segment 6 was, which is (4,4)?

Snake body: let's see occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n> \n> So (2,4) is not occupied, but is it a wall? x=2, y=4, not border, not obstacle. Obstacle is only (6,4), so (2,4) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, D (down to (1,3)): (1,3) not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> U (up to (1,5)): but (1,5) is part of the snake body, so moving there would cause collision, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5), so moving to (1,5) would hit body.\n> \n> Now, for moving to tail: if head moves to tail cell, it's okay because tail will move away, but only if it's the current tail position at the time of move.\n> \n> In this case, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (1,5) - occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - D: to (1,3) - free, I think\n> \n> - L: to (0,4) - x=0, border wall, cannot move\n> \n> - R: to (2,4) - free\n> \n> So only possible moves are D or R.\n> \n> D: down to (1,3)\n> \n> R: right to (2,4)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Food locations: (6,2) with life span 7, meaning it disappears after turn 25 + 7 = 32? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 25, life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 more turns, i.e., at the start of turn 32 or end of turn 31? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists for L turns including turn t. After turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Example: suppose at turn t, life_span L. On turn t, it is present, life_span decreases to L-1 for next turn. After L turns, on turn t+L, it should be gone.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,2) with life_span 7 at turn 25, it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning it is present on turns 25,26,27,28,29,30,31, and disappears at turn 32. So last chance to eat is on turn 31.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life_span 10, present from turn 25 to 34, disappears at turn 35.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> First, let's see the snake's position. Head at (1,4), tail at (4,5). The snake is coiled; from (1,4) down to (1,3) is free, right to (2,4) is free.\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), then head at (1,3), and tail moves to the next position. When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, tail is removed; if food eaten, tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move D to (1,3), which has no food, so tail at (4,5) is removed, new tail is (4,4)? Positions: after move, head to (1,3), then body: the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So initial positions: index 0: head (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (3,5), 6: (3,4), 7: (4,4), 8: tail (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3), no food eaten, so the tail is removed. So new positions: head (1,3), then segment 1 moves to (1,4), segment 2 moves to (1,5), segment 3 moves to (1,6), segment 4 moves to (2,6), segment 5 moves to (3,6), segment 6 moves to (3,5), segment 7 moves to (3,4), and tail segment 8 moves to (4,4). Since tail is removed, the new tail is segment 7 at (3,4)? Let's list:\n> \n> After move: head at (1,3)\n> \n> Then body: position that was index 0 is now (1,3), but index 1 was (1,5) moves to where index 0 was, (1,4)\n> \n> Index 2 was (1,6) moves to where index 1 was, (1,5)\n> \n> Index 3 was (2,6) moves to where index 2 was, (1,6)\n> \n> Index 4 was (3,6) moves to where index 3 was, (2,6)\n> \n> Index 5 was (3,5) moves to where index 4 was, (3,6)\n> \n> Index 6 was (3,4) moves to where index 5 was, (3,5)\n> \n> Index 7 was (4,4) moves to where index 6 was, (3,4)\n> \n> Index 8 was (4,5) is the tail, and since no food, it is removed, so the snake now has segments from index 0 to 7: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) with tail at (3,4)? Index 7 is at (3,4), which is now the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (2,4), head to (2,4), which is free, no food, so tail removed, new positions: head (2,4), then (1,4) moves to where head was? Index 1 moves to (1,4)? Let's not get bogged down.\n> \n> For planning, I need to think about paths to food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (5,6).\n> \n> (6,2) is at bottom-right, near the obstacle. (5,6) is top-right.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), which is left-middle.\n> \n> To reach (6,2), I need to go right and down. To (5,6), right and up.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving down to (1,3) or right to (2,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), then from there, I can go left, right, or down, but left is wall, down to (1,2) might be possible, or right to (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, from (2,4), I can go up, down, right, but not left since direction would be left, but current direction after move.\n> \n> I need to think multiple steps.\n> \n> Also, the tail is moving, so I need to avoid colliding with body.\n> \n> Moreover, the food at (6,2) has short life, only 7 turns, so I need to get it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) has longer life, 10 turns.\n> \n> But I should prioritize based on risk and reward.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> List all occupied cells: walls and snake.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

Earlier I had: after move D, positions: head (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) and tail is (3,4)? No, segments: index 0: (1,3) head, index 1: (1,4), index 2: (1,5), index 3: (1,6), index 4: (2,6), index 5: (3,6), index 6: (3,5), index 7: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> So tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, from (1,3), direction D, so can move D, L, R.\n> \n> L to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,3) free?

Segments: index 0: (2,4) head, index 1: (1,4), index 2: (1,5), index 3: (1,6), index 4: (2,6), index 5: (3,6), index 6: (3,5), index 7: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> Tail at (3,4).\n> \n> From (2,4), direction R, so can move U, D, R, not L (reverse).\n> \n> U to (2,5) : is (2,5) free?

Positions: head to (3,4), but (3,4) was tail, so now head is at (3,4), and the segment that was at index 7 (tail) moves to where index 6 was, but index 6 was at (3,5), so the new position for the segment that was tail depends.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> Before move: positions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4): new head at (3,4)\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where head was, (2,4)\n> \n> Segment that was at (1,5) moves to where it was, (1,4)\n> \n> Segment that was at (1,6) moves to (1,5)\n> \n> Segment that was at (2,6) moves to (1,6)\n> \n> Segment that was at (3,6) moves to (2,6)\n> \n> Segment that was at (3,5) moves to (3,6)\n> \n> Segment that was at (3,4) (tail) moves to where it was, (3,5)\n> \n> Since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the snake now has head at (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) with tail at (3,5).\n> \n> And (3,4) is now head, so no collision.\n> \n> So moving to tail cell is safe.\n> \n> Back to turn 25 choices.\n> \n> If I move D to (1,3), then from there I can go to (2,3) or (1,2), both free.\n> \n> If I move R to (2,4), then I can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3), or R to (3,4) which is safe as above.\n> \n> Now, to reach food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is at bottom-right.

No.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to the food cell, each body segment moves to the next position, and since food eaten, the tail remains in place, so the last body segment does not move, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, but since the tail doesn't move, it's like the snake extends.\n> \n> In terms of positions, when head moves to food cell, the body segments shift, but the tail position does not change, and the snake gains one segment at the tail.\n> \n> But the tail cell is occupied.\n> \n> In this case, before move, positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail\n> \n> After head moves to (6,2) and eats food: new head (6,2)\n> \n> Then body: segment that was at (4,2) moves to (5,2)\n> \n> Segment that was at (3,2) moves to (4,2)\n> \n> Segment that was at (3,3) moves to (3,2)\n> \n> Segment that was at (3,4) moves to (3,3)\n> \n> Segment that was at (2,4) moves to (3,4)\n> \n> Segment that was at (1,4) moves to (2,4)\n> \n> Segment that was at (1,5) moves to (1,4)\n> \n> And since food eaten, the tail segment does not move, so it stays at (1,5), and a new segment is added there? No: the tail segment remains, so it doesn't move to a new position; instead, it stays, and the snake has an additional segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) with tail at (1,5) still? The segment that was tail at (1,5) is still there, but now it's not the tail anymore; the new tail is the segment that was at (1,4) or something.\n> \n> After growth: the head is at (6,2), then the first body segment is at (5,2) (where head was), second body at (4,2), third at (3,2), fourth at (3,3), fifth at (3,4), sixth at (2,4), seventh at (1,4), eighth at (1,5), and tail at (1,5)? No, (1,5) is occupied by the segment that was previously tail, but since it didn't move, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> List: before eating: positions: 0: (5,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,5) tail\n> \n> After head moves to (6,2) and eats: head at (6,2)\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to (5,2) (previous head position)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to (4,2) (previous position of seg1)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to (3,2) (previous position of seg2)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to (3,3) (previous position of seg3)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to (3,4) (previous position of seg4)\n> \n> Segment 6 moves to (2,4) (previous position of seg5)\n> \n> Segment 7 moves to (1,4) (previous position of seg6)\n> \n> And since food eaten, the tail segment (segment 7) does not move, so it stays at (1,5)? Segment 7 was at (1,5), and it should move to where segment 6 was, (1,4), but because food eaten, it doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Standard: when food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but the tail does not move; instead, the tail remains, and the snake gains length.\n> \n> So in this case, segment 7 (tail) does not move; it stays at (1,5). Then the new positions are: head (6,2), then the moved segments: segment 1 at (5,2), segment 2 at (4,2), segment 3 at (3,2), segment 4 at (3,3), segment 5 at (3,4), segment 6 at (2,4), segment 7 at (1,4) (since it moved from (1,5) to (1,4)?

It's turn 25, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,4), and the body segments are (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). So the snake has 9 segments. Head is at (1,4), and tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, which is down. Since moving down decreases y, from (1,4) moving down would go to (1,3), but let's confirm the coordinate system. Typically, in such grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so U increases y, D decreases y. So (x,y+1) is up, meaning higher y is up, lower y is down.\n> \n> So head at (1,4), direction D, so moving down would be to (1,3).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive foods, no negative food here.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) is bottom-left? Since y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I assume.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7. But since it's borders, cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: positions: (1,4) head, then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So let's list the snake cells:\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)\n> \n> - Tail: (4,5)\n> \n> Direction is D, down. So current direction is down.\n> \n> Available moves: Since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U, because no instant reverse. So possible actions: L (left to (0,4)? x=0 is wall, so (0,4) is wall, cannot move left. R (right to (2,4)? Is (2,4) occupied? Snake body: let's see occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n> \n> So (2,4) is not occupied, but is it a wall? x=2, y=4, not border, not obstacle. Obstacle is only (6,4), so (2,4) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, D (down to (1,3)): (1,3) not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> U (up to (1,5)): but (1,5) is part of the snake body, so moving there would cause collision, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5), so moving to (1,5) would hit body.\n> \n> Now, for moving to tail: if head moves to tail cell, it's okay because tail will move away, but only if it's the current tail position at the time of move.\n> \n> In this case, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (1,5) - occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - D: to (1,3) - free, I think\n> \n> - L: to (0,4) - x=0, border wall, cannot move\n> \n> - R: to (2,4) - free\n> \n> So only possible moves are D or R.\n> \n> D: down to (1,3)\n> \n> R: right to (2,4)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Food locations: (6,2) with life span 7, meaning it disappears after turn 25 + 7 = 32? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 25, life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 more turns, i.e., at the start of turn 32 or end of turn 31? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists for L turns including turn t. After turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Example: suppose at turn t, life_span L. On turn t, it is present, life_span decreases to L-1 for next turn. After L turns, on turn t+L, it should be gone.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,2) with life_span 7 at turn 25, it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning it is present on turns 25,26,27,28,29,30,31, and disappears at turn 32. So last chance to eat is on turn 31.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life_span 10, present from turn 25 to 34, disappears at turn 35.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> First, let's see the snake's position. Head at (1,4), tail at (4,5). The snake is coiled; from (1,4) down to (1,3) is free, right to (2,4) is free.\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), then head at (1,3), and tail moves to the next position. When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, tail is removed; if food eaten, tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move D to (1,3), which has no food, so tail at (4,5) is removed, new tail is (4,4)? Positions: after move, head to (1,3), then body: the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So initial positions: index 0: head (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (3,5), 6: (3,4), 7: (4,4), 8: tail (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3), no food eaten, so the tail is removed. So new positions: head (1,3), then segment 1 moves to (1,4), segment 2 moves to (1,5), segment 3 moves to (1,6), segment 4 moves to (2,6), segment 5 moves to (3,6), segment 6 moves to (3,5), segment 7 moves to (3,4), and tail segment 8 moves to (4,4). Since tail is removed, the new tail is segment 7 at (3,4)? Let's list:\n> \n> After move: head at (1,3)\n> \n> Then body: position that was index 0 is now (1,3), but index 1 was (1,5) moves to where index 0 was, (1,4)\n> \n> Index 2 was (1,6) moves to where index 1 was, (1,5)\n> \n> Index 3 was (2,6) moves to where index 2 was, (1,6)\n> \n> Index 4 was (3,6) moves to where index 3 was, (2,6)\n> \n> Index 5 was (3,5) moves to where index 4 was, (3,6)\n> \n> Index 6 was (3,4) moves to where index 5 was, (3,5)\n> \n> Index 7 was (4,4) moves to where index 6 was, (3,4)\n> \n> Index 8 was (4,5) is the tail, and since no food, it is removed, so the snake now has segments from index 0 to 7: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) with tail at (3,4)? Index 7 is at (3,4), which is now the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (2,4), head to (2,4), which is free, no food, so tail removed, new positions: head (2,4), then (1,4) moves to where head was? Index 1 moves to (1,4)? Let's not get bogged down.\n> \n> For planning, I need to think about paths to food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (5,6).\n> \n> (6,2) is at bottom-right, near the obstacle. (5,6) is top-right.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), which is left-middle.\n> \n> To reach (6,2), I need to go right and down. To (5,6), right and up.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving down to (1,3) or right to (2,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (1,3), then from there, I can go left, right, or down, but left is wall, down to (1,2) might be possible, or right to (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, from (2,4), I can go up, down, right, but not left since direction would be left, but current direction after move.\n> \n> I need to think multiple steps.\n> \n> Also, the tail is moving, so I need to avoid colliding with body.\n> \n> Moreover, the food at (6,2) has short life, only 7 turns, so I need to get it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) has longer life, 10 turns.\n> \n> But I should prioritize based on risk and reward.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> List all occupied cells: walls and snake.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.
