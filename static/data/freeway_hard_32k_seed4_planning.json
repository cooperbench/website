        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction left means it moves left, so position decreases; right means it moves right, position increases.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new freeway, you're not considered on it until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you're still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t_1, which is 0, and we need to find actions for turns t=0 to t=H-1 such that at turn H-1, y=9. Since we start at turn 0, and we do actions from t=0 to H-1, after H actions, we have moved H steps, so position at turn H should be (0,9), but the turn index is up to H-1 for the actions.\n\nLet's clarify: at turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}. So at turn t, position is (0, y_t), we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 = 0 with y_0 = 0.\n\nWe want y_H = 9, and actions from a_0 to a_{H-1}, so after H actions, at turn H, y_H = 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we reach y_H = 9.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, when we are at position (0, y_T), we must not have collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf we choose to move to a different row, at the moment of moving, during turn T, we are still on row y_T, so collision check is only for row y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen we arrive at a new row, it's at the start of the next turn, I think.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked for y_T at turn T.\n\nAfter action, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision is checked for y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, cars move continuously; their positions at turn T are given by the span as a function of time from t_1.\n\nt_1 is the starting turn, which is 0.\n\nFor each car, we have its state at turn t_1=0.\n\nFor turn T, which is relative to t_1, so T = t - t_1, but since t_1=0, turn T is just the absolute turn number.\n\nSet t_1 = 0 for simplicity.\n\nSo at turn T, for a car on freeway k, with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf d is left, span at turn T is [h - s*T, τ - s*T] because from turn 0 to T, time elapsed is T, speed s, so position decreases by s*T for left-moving.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ + s*T, h + s*T], since tail to head, moving right.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail, left, speed). Head and tail: for left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so as it moves left, head decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is the front when moving right, so head increases.\n\nIn the span, for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, always at x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, we need to check if there is a car whose span contains 0 at that turn.\n\nBut only if the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player is only on one freeway per turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, we need to move up 9 steps. But we can move down or stay, but to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nSince the grid is small, only 10 rows, and time is discrete, we can simulate the possible moves.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 2: same, (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when 0 is occupied by a car at turn T.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: car (48,83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span at turn T: [h - sT, τ - sT] = [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\n0 is in span if 48 - 36T ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36T\n\nSimilarly, since it's a car, the span is from min to max, but for left-moving, head is 48, tail 83, but as it moves left, head decreases, tail decreases, so the span [48-36T, 83-36T], and since 48<83, it's [low, high] with low=48-36T, high=83-36T.\n\n0 in span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSo 48 - 36T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 83 - 36T\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36T ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 36T => T ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T ≥ 2 since T integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ 83 - 36T => 36T ≤ 83 => T ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T ≤ 2.\n\nT ≥ 2 and T ≤ 2, so T=2.\n\nCheck:\n\nT=2: low = 48 - 36*2 = 48 - 72 = -24\n\nhigh = 83 - 72 = 11\n\nSo span [-24, 11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nT=1: low=48-36=12, high=83-36=47, 12 to 47, 0 not in.\n\nT=3: low=48-108=-60, high=83-108=-25, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=2, freeway 1 has a car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, so also only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so span: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [37 + 6T, 48 + 6T]\n\nSince tail to head, moving right.\n\nSo [37+6T, 48+6T]\n\n0 in span if 37+6T ≤ 0 ≤ 48+6T\n\nBut 37+6T is always positive for T>=0, so 0 < 37+6T <= something, so 0 cannot be <= 37+6T since 37+6T >=37>0, so 0 not in span for any T. Similarly, 48+6T>0 always.\n\nSo this car never at x=0.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (12,1, right, 6)\n\nSpan: [1 + 6T, 12 + 6T]\n\n0 in? 1+6T <=0 <=12+6T? 1+6T >=1>0, so 0 not <=1+6T, so never.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nHead and tail: given (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving, head is front, so as moves right, head increases.\n\nSpan: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-35 + 6T, -24 + 6T]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6T <= 0 <= -24 + 6T\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n-35 + 6T <= 0 => 6T <= 35 => T <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, T <=5\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 + 6T => 6T >= 24 => T >= 4\n\nSo T=4,5\n\nT=4: low = -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nT=5: low= -35+30= -5, high= -24+30=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=3: low= -35+18= -17, high= -24+18= -6, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=6: low= -35+36=1, high= -24+36=12, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=4 and T=5, this car is at x=0 on freeway 3.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, so cars: (48,37,right,6) never at 0, (12,1,right,6) never at 0, (-24,-35,right,6) at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSo freeway 4 also occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (48,37,right,6)\n\nAs above, span [37+6T, 48+6T], always positive, never at 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, (48,37,right,6), never at 0.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,6), never at 0.\n\nFreeway 8: same, (48,37,right,6), never at 0.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 each have only one car, which never at 0.\n\nNow freeway 3 and 4 have the third car at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 have car at T=2.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 0.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume. Cars only on freeways 1-8.\n\nAt turn 0, position (0,0), no car on y=0, so safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the rows when they are occupied.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\n- For row 1: occupied only at T=2\n\n- Row 2: occupied only at T=2\n\n- Row 3: occupied at T=4 and T=5\n\n- Row 4: occupied at T=4 and T=5\n\n- Rows 5,6,7,8: never occupied, so always safe.\n\nRows 5-8 no cars at x=0 ever, so we can be on them any time.\n\nBut we need to pass through rows 1-4, but at times when not occupied.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- To be on row 1 at turn T: must not T=2\n\nSimilarly row 2: not T=2\n\nRow 3: not T=4 or T=5\n\nRow 4: not T=4 or T=5\n\nSince rows 5-8 always safe.\n\nNow, we start at y=0, turn 0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nEach move, we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, minimum moves: if we always go up, 9 moves, so H=9, from turn 0 to turn 9, position at turn 9 is y=9.\n\nBut we might need to avoid some rows at certain times, so we might need to wait or go down.\n\nBut since rows 5-8 are always safe, and the only dangers are rows 1-4 at specific times.\n\nMoreover, rows 1 and 2 are only dangerous at T=2, so we can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly, rows 3 and 4 dangerous at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince we start at turn 0, y=0.\n\nAt turn 0, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, at turn 1, we are on y=1.\n\nBut at turn 1, is row 1 safe? Row 1 is only dangerous at T=2, so at T=1, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be not on row 1 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote the turn number T.\n\nWe need y_T for each T.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H.\n\ny_T must be safe at turn T, meaning that for row y_T, at turn T, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, for row 1: safe except T=2\n\nRow 2: safe except T=2\n\nRow 3: safe except T=4 and T=5\n\nRow 4: safe except T=4 and T=5\n\nRows 0,5,6,7,8,9: always safe, since no cars or not freeway.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=5 to 8: freeways with no car at x=0 ever, so always safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up fast.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on row 1 or 2 at T=2, and avoid row 3 or 4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n- Go up directly, but check if we hit a bad time.\n\nStart: T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nT=0 action: suppose we go up, U.\n\nThen T=1, y=1, now at T=1, row 1 is safe since only dangerous at T=2.\n\nNow at T=1, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go up, U, then T=2, y=2.\n\nBut at T=2, row 2 is dangerous! Because row 2 occupied at T=2.\n\nSo if we are on y=2 at T=2, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, we could stay, S, then T=2, y=1, but row 1 occupied at T=2, also collision.\n\nOr go down, D, to y=0 at T=2.\n\nBut y=0 safe.\n\nBut then we are back, wasted moves.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nAt T=0, we could stay, S, then T=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=1, go up, U, to T=2, y=1, but at T=2, row 1 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=0, go up to T=1 y=1.\n\nThen at T=1, to avoid being on row 1 or 2 at T=2, we need to not be on row 1 or 2 at T=2.\n\nSo at T=1, we are on y=1, we can go down to y=0, or stay on y=1, but both lead to collision at T=2 if we are on row 1 or 2.\n\nIf we go down to y=0 at T=2, y=0 safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at T=2.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nBut T=2 is past, and row 1 and 2 are only dangerous at T=2, so after that, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 3 and 4 dangerous at T=4 and 5.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: safe for T ≠ 2\n\n- Row 2: safe for T ≠ 2\n\n- Row 3: safe for T ∉ {4,5}\n\n- Row 4: safe for T ∉ {4,5}\n\n- Rows 0,5,6,7,8,9: always safe.\n\nWe start at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical points are to avoid row 1 or 2 at T=2, and row 3 or 4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nOne way is to delay our movement so that we are not on those rows at those times.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=0 for some turns until after T=2.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut we have to deal with T=4 and T=5 later.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to higher rows quickly if possible.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are always safe, if we can reach row 5 before T=4, then we can stay there or go up during T=4 and T=5, since safe.\n\nThen after that, go to 9.\n\nBut we need to get to row 5 first.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=5, that's 5 steps up.\n\nBut we have to pass through rows 1-4, avoiding the bad times.\n\nSpecifically, we need to not be on row 1 or 2 at T=2, and not on row 3 or 4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nNow, T=2 is early, T=4 and 5 later.\n\nLet's consider the sequence of y_t.\n\nStart T=0, y=0.\n\nNow, action at T=0.\n\nIf we go up, y=1 at T=1.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, safe (since T=1 ≠2).\n\nNow at T=1, we need to choose action for T=2.\n\nWe cannot be on y=1 or y=2 at T=2, so we must move to y=0 or y= something else.\n\ny can only change by ±1 or 0, so from y=1, at T=1, we can go to y=0, y=1, or y=2.\n\nBut if we go to y=1 or y=2 at T=2, collision.\n\nSo only choice is to go down to y=0 at T=2.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we are at T=2, y=0.\n\nT=2 is over, so row 1 and 2 are safe for later.\n\nNow, we need to go up.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, we can go up to y=1 at T=3.\n\nT=3, row 1: is it safe? Row 1 dangerous only at T=2, so at T=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=1 at T=3.\n\nThen at T=3, y=1.\n\nNow, we need to go to higher rows.\n\nBut we have to avoid row 3 and 4 at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow at T=3, y=1, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, if y=2, row 2 is safe since only dangerous at T=2, so T=4 is fine.\n\nBut row 3 and 4 are dangerous at T=4 if we are on them.\n\ny=2 is row 2, which is not row 3 or 4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, if we are on y=2, it's safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=3 at T=5? But at T=5, row 3 dangerous.\n\nLet's step by step.\n\nT=2: y=0\n\nAction at T=2: U, to y=1 at T=3.\n\nT=3: y=1, safe.\n\nAction at T=3: can go U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, row 2 safe (since not T=2).\n\nNow action at T=4: we can go U to y=3 at T=5.\n\nBut at T=5, if y=3, row 3 dangerous at T=5.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom T=4 y=2, we could stay, S, so y=2 at T=5, row 2 safe.\n\nOr go down, but not useful.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nIf we go U to y=3 at T=5, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, we could go down to y=1 at T=5.\n\nBut y=1 at T=5: row 1 safe since not T=2.\n\nBut we are going down, not efficient.\n\nThen at T=5, y=1, we can go up to y=2 at T=6, etc., but we are wasting time.\n\nSince rows 3 and 4 are dangerous at T=4 and T=5, we can be on row 5 or above during T=4 and T=5, since safe.\n\nBut to be on row 5, we need to reach it before T=4.\n\nFrom T=3, y=1, we are at T=3.\n\nIf we go up twice quickly.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, action U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, safe as above.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=5, that's 3 steps, but at T=4, we are at y=2, we need to go to y=3,4,5.\n\nBut if we go to y=3 at T=5, which is dangerous.\n\nT=4 action: from y=2, if we go U to y=3 at T=5, but T=5 row 3 dangerous.\n\nIf we go U at T=4 to y=3 at T=5, collision.\n\nIf we stay at T=4, y=2 at T=5, safe, but then we are at y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, we can go U to y=3 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, row 3 safe? Row 3 dangerous at T=4 and 5, so T=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nWe are at T=5, y=2, go U to y=3 at T=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at T=7, safe (row 4 dangerous only at 4,5, so T=7 safe).\n\nThen U to y=5 at T=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=5 to y=9: need to go up 7 steps, so at T=12, y=9.\n\nBut we started at T=0, so H=12 turns? But we can do better.\n\nSince rows 5-8 safe all time, we can go to row 5 before T=4 and stay there during T=4 and T=5, then go up.\n\nBut to reach y=5 from y=0.\n\nMinimum 5 up moves.\n\nBut we have delays.\n\nBack to beginning.\n\nAt T=0, y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, we can stay at y=0 for the first few turns.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until after T=2.\n\nSo at T=0, action S, y=0 at T=1.\n\nT=1, action S, y=0 at T=2. At T=2, y=0 safe.\n\nNow T=2 over, row 1 and 2 safe after.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, action U to y=1 at T=3.\n\nT=3, y=1, safe.\n\nNow we need to go up, but avoid row 3 and 4 at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, we can go U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, safe (row 2 only bad at T=2).\n\nNow at T=4, we are at y=2, but row 3 and 4 bad at T=4 and T=5.\n\nIf we go U to y=3 at T=5, but T=5 row 3 bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom T=4 y=2, we can stay S, so y=2 at T=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, go U to y=3 at T=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at T=7, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at T=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=6,7,8,9 at T=9,10,11,12. y=9 at T=12.\n\nH=12, but we can reach faster.\n\nSince we can move faster through the lower rows if we time it.\n\nAnother idea: go up to row 4 before T=4, then at T=4 and T=5, since row 4 is bad, we need to not be on it, so we can go down to row 3 or something, but row 3 also bad at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFor example, at T=3, we can be on y=3 or y=4, but at T=4, if we are on y=3 or y=4, bad.\n\nSo we need to be below or above during T=4 and T=5.\n\nSpecifically, at T=4 and T=5, we should be on y<=2 or y>=5.\n\nSince rows 0,1,2 safe at T=4 and T=5, because only row 1 and 2 bad at T=2, which is past.\n\nSimilarly, rows 5-9 safe.\n\nRows 3 and 4 bad at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSo at turns T=4 and T=5, we must be on y <=2 or y>=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=2, we must not be on y=1 or y=2.\n\nNow, from start, at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y such that for T=2, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo at T=2, y must be 0 or >=3.\n\nBut y can only change slowly.\n\nLet's list the position over time.\n\nLet y_t for t=0,1,2,...\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAt t=0, action a_0, determines y_1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe want to reach y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- At t=2, y_2 cannot be 1 or 2.\n\n- At t=4, y_4 cannot be 3 or 4\n\n- At t=5, y_5 cannot be 3 or 4\n\nOther times no restriction from cars, but y between 0 and 9.\n\nSince rows 5-8 always safe, and we can be there.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up fast, but with constraints.\n\nOne efficient way: be at y=5 or above by t=4, so that at t=4 and t=5, we are safe on y>=5.\n\nThen we can go directly to 9.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=0 to y=5 at t=4.\n\nThat's 5 steps in 4 moves? From t to t+1, one action.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, t=1, y1 = y0 + Δy, so y1 can be 0 or 1.\n\nAfter two actions, t=2, y2 can be from 0 to 2, etc.\n\nTo have y4 =5, we need to have moved up 5 steps in 4 actions, so net +5 in 4 moves, possible if we go up each time except possibly one stay or down, but to maximize, go up each time.\n\nIf all U, y1=1, y2=2, y3=3, y4=4.\n\nBut y4=4, and at t=4, if y4=4, row 4 dangerous at t=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\ny4=4 is bad.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only go up one per turn, so y4 <=4 if start from y0=0 with 4 up moves, y4=4 max.\n\ny0=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\nBut at t=4, y=4, dangerous.\n\nIf we have a down or stay, y4 less than 4.\n\nBut we want y4=5, impossible with 4 actions from 0.\n\nMaximum y4 is 4.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=5 or above at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3, y3 <=3.\n\nSo at t=4, we must be on y<=2 or y=5 or above, but y=5 impossible at t=4, so must be y<=2 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, we can be y=5 or above.\n\nBut at t=5, y<=2 or y>=5.\n\nNow, from above, at t=4, y4 must be <=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y5 must be <=2 or >=5.\n\nBut since y4 <=2, and y5 = y4 + Δy, so y5 <=3 or 2 if down, but max y5= y4 +1 <=3.\n\nSo y5 <=3, so y5 cannot be >=5, so must be <=2 at t=5 as well.\n\nBecause y5 <=3 <5.\n\nSo at t=5, y5 must be <=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, y4 <=2.\n\nNow, also at t=2, y2 must not be 1 or 2, so y2=0 or >=3.\n\nBut since we start from y0=0, and t=2 early, y2 <=2, so y2 cannot be >=3, so must be y2=0.\n\ny2 must be 0.\n\nBecause y2 cannot be 1 or 2, and y2 cannot be >=3 since from y0=0 in 2 moves, y2 max 2.\n\ny0=0, after 2 actions, y2 can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut y2 cannot be 1 or 2, so must be y2=0.\n\nSo at t=2, we must be at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, from above, at t=4, y4 <=2, and at t=5, y5 <=2.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, let's see the actions.\n\nStart t=0, y0=0.\n\nAt t=0, action: to have y2=0.\n\nIf we go U at t=0, y1=1.\n\nThen at t=1, to have y2=0, we must go D, so y2=0.\n\nIf we go S at t=0, y1=0, then at t=1, to have y2=0, we can go S or D, but D to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so only S, y2=0.\n\nSimilarly, if D at t=0, y1=0? y0=0, D to y1=-1 invalid, y min 0, so from y=0, cannot go D, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly at other boundaries.\n\ny in [0,9], so at y=0, cannot go D, actions: U or S.\n\nAt y=9, cannot go U, only D or S.\n\nHere start at y=0.\n\nSo at t=0, actions possible: U or S.\n\nIf U, y1=1.\n\nIf S, y1=0.\n\nNow, to have y2=0.\n\nCase 1: if a0=S, y1=0, then at t=1, to have y2=0, since y1=0, cannot D, so must S, y2=0.\n\nCase 2: if a0=U, y1=1, then at t=1, to have y2=0, must go D, y2=0.\n\nSo two possibilities: either stay at 0 for first two turns, or go up then down.\n\nIn both cases, y2=0.\n\nNow, at t=2, y2=0.\n\nNow, we need to go up.\n\nBut at t=4, y4 must be <=2.\n\nSimilarly t=5, y5 <=2.\n\nNow, from t=2, y2=0.\n\nt=3, y3 can be 0 or 1.\n\nt=4, y4 must be <=2.\n\nBut y4 <=2 is easy.\n\nBut we also need y4 <=2 and y5 <=2.\n\nSince y5 = y4 + Δy, to have y5 <=2, since y4 <=2, if y4 <=1, y5 <=2 easily, if y4=2, then y5 must not be 3, so must S or D to y=2 or 1.\n\nBut we also need to avoid row 3 and 4 at t=4 and t=5, but since we are on y<=2 at t=4 and t=5, rows 1 and 2 are safe except t=2 which is past, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nAfter t=5, the dangerous times are over, so we can go up freely to y=9.\n\nBut we are at y5 <=2.\n\ny5 <=2, at t=5.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum moves: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so at least 7 actions.\n\ny5 to y6, ..., to y12=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position after action.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=0 to t=H, y_H.\n\nWe start y_0=0, after H actions, y_H=9.\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\ny_H - y_0 = sum of Δy over H actions.\n\nSince Δy in {-1,0,1}, to go from 0 to 9, need at least 9 net up moves.\n\nBut with delays.\n\nIn this case, with constraints.\n\nFrom above, we must have y2=0.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=5, we have 3 actions (for t=3,4,5?).\n\ny2 at t=2.\n\nActions at t=2, t=3, t=4 determine y3, y4, y5.\n\ny2=0.\n\ny3 = y2 + Δy2, so y3 = 0 or 1.\n\ny4 = y3 + Δy3, so y4 = y3 + {-1,0,1}, but y3 <=1, so y4 <=2, and since y4 must be <=2, it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, y5 = y4 + Δy4.\n\ny5 must be <=2.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should go up as much as possible, but with y4<=2 and y5<=2.\n\nSince y2=0, we can go up to y3=1, then to y4=2, but y4=2, then for y5, to keep y5<=2, we must not go up to 3, so at t=4 action, must S or D, so y5=2 or 1.\n\nBut since we want to minimize time, better to be as high as possible, so at y5=2.\n\nThen after t=5, we go up directly to 9.\n\nNow, y5=2.\n\nThen to go to y=9, need 7 up moves, so y6=3, y7=4, y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nSo H=12, y12=9.\n\nActions from a0 to a11.\n\nNow, but we can do better? Earlier I thought about going to higher rows faster, but with constraints, it seems not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 5 at t=5 or something.\n\nBut at t=5, y5 must be <=2, so we cannot be high at t=5.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nInstead of going up slowly, we can go up fast to row 5, but to reach row 5 from y=0 at t=2, to y=5 at t=5, that's 3 actions: need +5 in 3 moves, impossible, max y5=3 if start from y2=0 with all up: y3=1, y4=2, y5=3.\n\nBut at t=5, y=3, but row 3 dangerous at t=5, collision.\n\nIf y5=3, not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=4 at t=5, but from y2=0, with 3 actions, y5 <=3, so y5=3 max.\n\nCannot reach y=5 by t=5.\n\nSo indeed, we must have y5 <=2.\n\nThus the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nStart t=0, y0=0.\n\nTo have y2=0, we can choose:\n\nOption 1: stay at 0 for first two turns.\n\na0 = S, y1=0\n\na1 = S, y2=0\n\nOption 2: up then down.\n\na0 = U, y1=1\n\na1 = D, y2=0 (since y1=1, D to 0)\n\nNow, both ok, but to minimize time, option 1 has y2=0 with no net move, option 2 has y2=0 but we went up and down, wasted move? In terms of position, same, but in terms of actions, both use two actions to stay at 0, but in option 2, we moved to 1 and back, but position same.\n\nBut for reaching high, no difference.\n\nNow, from t=2, y2=0.\n\nNow, we need to go up to y=2 by t=5, but with y4<=2 and y5<=2.\n\nTo be efficient, go up to y=2 as soon as possible.\n\nAt t=2, action: U, to y3=1\n\nt=3, action: U, to y4=2\n\nNow y4=2 <=2, good.\n\nAt t=4, action: since y5 must be <=2, and we are at y4=2, so cannot go U, must S or D.\n\nTo be high, S to y5=2.\n\nThen y5=2.\n\nNow, from t=5, y=2, we can go up directly: a5=U, y6=3\n\na6=U, y7=4\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nNow, at each point, check safety.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: if we took option 1, y=0, safe; option 2, y=1, safe since t=1 not 2.\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=1, row 1 safe (t=3 not 2)\n\nt=4: y=2, row 2 safe (t=4 not 2)\n\nt=5: y=2, row 2 safe\n\nt=6: y=3, row 3: dangerous at t=4,5, t=6 not, so safe\n\nt=7: y=4, row 4: dangerous at t=4,5, t=7 not, safe\n\nt=8: y=5, row 5 always safe\n\nSimilarly t=9 y=6, safe\n\nt=10 y=7, safe\n\nt=11 y=8, safe\n\nt=12 y=9, safe\n\nNow, H=12, from a0 to a11.\n\nBut we need the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, for actions, we have a0 to a11.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be actions from t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, here t_1=0, so turns 0 to 11.\n\ny at turn 12.\n\nNumber of actions: 12 actions.\n\nMinimal H? Is there a way with less?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut with the constraints, we must be at y=0 at t=2, and y<=2 at t=5.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=2 is t=5, as above.\n\nThen from y=2 to y=9, 7 moves, so t=12.\n\nIf we are at y=1 at t=5, then to y=9, 8 moves, worse.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we can choose how to get to y2=0.\n\nEither all stay, or up-down.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, same.\n\nBut perhaps up-down is same, or we can use it to be at different position, but here no benefit.\n\nIn the sequence above, from t=2 to t=4, we went to y=2.\n\nBut at t=4, we stayed to y=2 at t=5.\n\nWe could, from t=2, go up slower, but better to be high.\n\nAnother point: at t=3, y=1, we could stay at y=1 for t=4, but y4=1, which is <=2, then at t=4, go to y=2 at t=5, but y5=2, same as before.\n\nBut then we have y4=1, y5=2.\n\nCompared to previous y4=2, y5=2.\n\nIn previous, at t=4 we are at y=2, which is fine.\n\nNo difference.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nFor example, take option 1 for start: stay at 0 for t=0 and t=1.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 0: action S? t=0 action.\n\nList actions.\n\nTurn t: action a_t\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy\n\nBut position at turn t is y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, we need a_t for t=0 to 11.\n\ny_0=0\n\na0: let's say S, then y1=0\n\na1: S, y2=0\n\na2: U, y3=1\n\na3: U, y4=2\n\na4: S, y5=2  (since at t=4, action S, so y5=2)\n\na5: U, y6=3\n\na6: U, y7=4\n\na7: U, y8=5\n\na8: U, y9=6\n\na9: U, y10=7\n\na10: U, y11=8\n\na11: U, y12=9\n\nActions from a0 to a11, 12 actions.\n\nIf we use up-down at start:\n\na0: U, y1=1\n\na1: D, y2=0  (from y1=1, D to 0)\n\na2: U, y3=1\n\na3: U, y4=2\n\na4: S, y5=2\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIn this case, at t=1, we were at y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut same number of actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for freeways, at t=3, y=1, row 1, which is freeway, but at t=3, no car at x=0, as we checked earlier, only at t=2 for row 1.\n\nSimilarly all safe.\n\nBut is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, at t=5, we are at y=2, but if we could be at y=3 or higher, but we cannot because of the constraint at t=5.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at y=0 at t=2, but earlier we derived that y2 must be 0.\n\nIs that necessary?\n\ny2 cannot be 1 or 2, and cannot be >=3, so must be 0.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps at t=2, we can be at y=0, but we can be moving or something, but position is fixed per turn.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go to y=3 at t=3, but t=3 row 3 is safe, but then at t=4, if we are at y=3, dangerous.\n\nBut we can go down to y=2 at t=4, but y=2 at t=4 is safe, but then at t=5, if we go to y=3, dangerous.\n\nNot better.\n\nFor example, start: t=0, y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, but y2=2, but at t=2, y=2 dangerous, not possible.\n\nMust not be at 1 or 2 at t=2.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nFreeway 3: at T=4 and 5, occupied.\n\nIn our sequence, we are never on row 3 or 4 at t=4 or 5.\n\nAt t=6, y=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nH=12, actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nIn the format, turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=0.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5-8 have cars but never at x=0, so ok.\n\nIn the sequence, we can choose how to start.\n\nTo make it simple, let's use the first option.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: S  (a0=S, to y1=0)\n\nTurn 1: S  (a1=S, to y2=0)\n\nTurn 2: U  (a2=U, to y3=1)\n\nTurn 3: U  (a3=U, to y4=2)\n\nTurn 4: S  (a4=S, to y5=2)  // since we stay to avoid going to 3 at t=5\n\nAt t=4, action S, so y5=2\n\nThen\n\nTurn 5: U  (a5=U, to y6=3)\n\nTurn 6: U  (a6=U, to y7=4)\n\nTurn 7: U  (a7=U, to y8=5)\n\nTurn 8: U  (a8=U, to y9=6)\n\nTurn 9: U  (a9=U, to y10=7)\n\nTurn 10: U  (a10=U, to y11=8)\n\nTurn 11: U  (a11=U, to y12=9)\n\nNow, H=12.\n\nBut we can start with up-down.\n\nBut same H.\n\nIn turn 4, we used S, but we could use D to y=1, but then y5=1, worse, so S is better.\n\ny5=2 is best.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn 4, we are at y=2, and we do S to stay at y=2 for turn 5.\n\nIf we do nothing, but we have to specify action.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nThe answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nAnother thought: what if we go to row 4 before t=4, but then at t=4, we need to not be on it.\n\nFor example, at t=3, if we are at y=4, but y=4 at t=3, row 4 safe? Row 4 dangerous at t=4 and 5, not t=3, so safe.\n\nBut at t=3, y=4.\n\nThen at t=4, we need to move away, to y=3 or y=5, but y=5 not reachable in one step, y=4 to y=3,4,5.\n\nIf to y=5, but y=5 at t=4, row 5 safe.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=5, need U.\n\nBut at t=4 action, if we go U to y=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=5, safe.\n\nBut can we reach y=4 at t=3?\n\nFrom start, y0=0.\n\nTo y=4 at t=3: need 4 up in 3 moves? y3=4 possible? y0=0, a0=U, y1=1; a1=U, y2=2; a2=U, y3=3; max y3=3, cannot y3=4.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=3 possible: as before.\n\nBut at t=3, y=3, row 3 safe at t=3.\n\nThen at t=4, we need to not be on row 3 or 4, so from y=3, we can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nIf go to y=2, safe at t=4.\n\nThen at t=5, we need to not be on 3 or 4, so on y=2, safe.\n\nBut y=2 at t=4 and t=5, then go up later.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at t=5, same as before.\n\nIf from y=3 at t=3, we go down to y=2 at t=4, etc.\n\nBut same position.\n\nNo gain.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nSo the sequence as above.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nWe need to list actions from turn t_1=0 to turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, we have turn 0 to turn 11.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut let's write it clearly.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, we have multiple cars, but we considered the one that occupies x=0.\n\nIn freeway 3, cars: (48,37,right,6) never at 0, (12,1,right,6) never at 0, (-24,-35,right,6) at T=4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly for 4.\n\nOthers no issue.\n\nSo I think ok.\n\nThus the minimal number of turns H is 12, with the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 4 is S, to stay at y=2 for turn 5.\n\nWe could have turn 4: D, to y=1 at turn 5, but then y=1, which is lower, then need more moves up, worse.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nIn the up-down start:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 1, we did D, which might be less intuitive, but same.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI'll use the first one.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. This sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway where a car occupies the x-position 0 at the same turn.\n\n### Key Constraints from Car Positions:\n- **Freeway 1 and 2**: Occupied at turn \\(T = 2\\) only.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars there on the turn I arrive.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The game starts at turn t1=1, and I need to find actions from turn 1 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the time from turn 1. So at turn T, which is T - t1 + 1 turns after t1? t1 is 1, so turn T means the turn number T.\n\nSet t=0 as turn t1, for simplicity. In the problem, t1 is given, and we use t from 0 to H-1 for actions a_{t1+t}.\n\nBut for car positions, it's given at t1=1.\n\nSo let's define time τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn t1.\n\nτ = T - t1, so at T=t1, τ=0.\n\nIn player position, y_{t+1} depends on a_t, so at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nLet me use t for turns relative to t1.\n\nSo at time t (t=0,1,2,...), turn number is t1 + t.\n\nPlayer position: at time t, y_t.\n\nAction a_{t1+t} is taken at time t, affects y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t is before action a_t, and after action, at time t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nSimilarly, for cars, at turn T, which is t1 + t for time t.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at that turn.\n\nThe span at turn T is given based on initial span at t1.\n\nt1=1.\n\nGiven car states at t1=1.\n\nFor each freeway, cars are listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nFor left-moving cars, head and tail: at t1, span [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince left-moving, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [τ, h] at t1, I think? Let's see.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3 and 4, it has (54,43,right,6), etc. 54>43, but if right-moving, head should be greater, I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Car update rules:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1, and speed s.\n\nThen at turn T > t1:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, since it moves right.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3: (54,43,right,6) — but 54 and 43, if Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for this car, τ=43, h=54? But it says (head, tail), so head is 54, tail is 43, but for right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head is at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nIn the notation, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail (left end), h is head (right end).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], h is head (right end for left-mover? Let's see.\n\nLeft-moving: head at h, tail at τ, and since moving left, head is decreasing, so at t1, [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume, so span from τ to h, but [h, τ] might imply h to τ, but if h>τ, [h,τ] would be decreasing, but in interval notation, [min,max] usually.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nIn left-moving case, Span(t1) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ, and it decreases, so if h > τ, then [h, τ] is from τ to h with τ < h, but [h,τ] with h>τ is not standard; usually we write [min,max].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the freeway 3 entry, (54,43,right,6), so head=54, tail=43, direction right, so since right-moving, head is at 54, tail at 43, so span from 43 to 54, so τ=43, h=54, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [43,54].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), head=12, tail=47, direction left, so head at 12, tail at 47? But if moving left, head should be left or right?\n\nMoving left, so if x decreases, head is at smaller x, tail at larger x? Let's think.\n\nIn left-moving car, as it moves left, the front (head) is decreasing, and tail is also decreasing.\n\nAt t1, if head is at h, tail at τ, and moving left, so span [h, τ] with h < τ, I think? Because if head is at smaller x, tail at larger x.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if at T, h - sΔT and τ - sΔT, so if ΔT increases, both decrease, so for the span to be valid, h should be less than τ? Let's see an example.\n\nFreeway 1: (12,47,left,36), head=12, tail=47, direction left.\n\nAt t1=1, Span=[12,47]? But [12,47] from 12 to 47, which is increasing, but moving left, so at later time, it should be smaller numbers.\n\nAt T, [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\nFor example at T=1, [12,47], at T=2, [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11], etc.\n\nSo the span is from min to max? At T=1, min=12, max=47.\n\nAt T=2, min=-24, max=11, so from -24 to 11.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, freeway 3: (54,43,right,6), head=54, tail=43, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [43,54], so min=43, max=54.\n\nAt T, [43 + 6(T-1), 54 + 6(T-1)]\n\nAt T=1, [43,54], at T=2, [49,60], etc.\n\nIn the collision condition, 0 in Span(T) means 0 between min and max of the span at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nCollision if at turn T, y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, but we can find for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nThen for player, when on that freeway at that time, collision.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T if y_T = y.\n\nAnd when moving, at turn T, after action, position y_{T} is set, and we check for that y.\n\nIn the sequence, at time t (relative to t1=1), position y_t at turn t1+t.\n\nAction a_t at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn T = t1 + t, the position is y_t (since turn T corresponds to time t, with T = t1 + t).\n\nSet t=0 at t1=1.\n\nSo at time t=0, turn 1, position y_0 = 0 (given).\n\nWe take action a_0, which affects y_1.\n\nThen at turn T=1 (t=0), position y_0.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars at that turn.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway k=y_T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at t=0 to y=9 at some time H, so y_H =9.\n\nMinimize H.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=H-1, since a_{t} determines y_{t+1}, so to have y_H, we need H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with a_t.\n\nStart y_0 =0, after H actions, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nSince y changes by -1,0,1, to go from 0 to 9, minimum H is 9 if we go up every time, but we might need to avoid collisions, so H could be larger.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k=1 to 8, the set of times when 0 is occupied, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0 on freeway k at turn T.\n\nTurn T is absolute turn number.\n\nt1=1, so T from 1 onwards.\n\nBut since we start at T=1, and we care about T from 1 to some point.\n\nFor each freeway, given the cars.\n\nList the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=12, tail=47, left, speed=36)\n\nAt turn T, span: [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)] for T>=1.\n\n0 in span when min <= 0 <= max, so\n\n12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, 12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 => 12 <= 36(T-1) => T-1 >= 12/36 = 1/3, so T >= 1 + 1/3, since T integer, T >= 2? T-1 >= 1/3, T >= 1 + 1/3, so T >= 2 since T integer.\n\nT-1 >= ceil(1/3) but 1/3<1, so T-1 >=1? Let's calculate.\n\n12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 => 36(T-1) >=12 => T-1 >= 12/36 = 1/3, so since T-1 integer, T-1 >= 1 (because 1/3 <1, so min integer is 1), T-1 >=1, T>=2.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1) => 36(T-1) <=47 => T-1 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T-1 <=1 since integer, T-1 <=1, T<=2.\n\nSo T-1 >=1 and T-1 <=1, so T-1=1, T=2.\n\nThus for freeway 1, 0 in span only at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, min = 12 -36(1) = 12-36=-24, max=47-36=11, so 0 between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt T=1, min=12, max=47, 0 not in [12,47].\n\nAt T=3, min=12-72=-60, max=47-72=-25, 0 not in [-60,-25].\n\nSo only at T=2.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, (12,47,left,36), so only occupied at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), head=54, tail=43, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1=1: [τ,h] = [43,54]\n\nAt T: [43 + 6(T-1), 54 + 6(T-1)]\n\n0 in span: 43 + 6(T-1) <= 0 <= 54 + 6(T-1)\n\nFirst, 43 + 6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <= -43 => T-1 <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, since T-1 >=0? T>=1, T-1>=0, but -7.166 <0, so 43 +6(T-1) >=43 >0 for all T>=1, so min >=43>0, so 0 never <= min, thus 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (18,7,right,6), head=18, tail=7, span at t1: [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7 + 6(T-1), 18 + 6(T-1)]\n\n0 in span: 7 + 6(T-1) <= 0 <= 18 + 6(T-1)\n\nFirst, 7 +6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <= -7 => T-1 <= -7/6 ≈ -1.166, impossible for T>=1, so min=7+6(T-1) >=7>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-18,-29,right,6), head=-18, tail=-29? tail=-29, head=-18.\n\nSpan at t1: for right-moving, [τ,h] = [-29,-18] since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nAt T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-29 + 6(T-1), -18 + 6(T-1)]\n\n0 in span: -29 + 6(T-1) <= 0 <= -18 + 6(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: -29 + 6(T-1) <= 0 => 6(T-1) <= 29 => T-1 <= 29/6 ≈ 4.833, so T-1 <=4, T<=5\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -18 + 6(T-1) => 18 <= 6(T-1) => 6(T-1) >=18 => T-1 >=3, T>=4\n\nSo T-1 >=3 and T-1 <=4, so T-1=3 or 4, T=4 or 5.\n\nAt T=4: min= -29 +6(3) = -29+18= -11, max= -18+18=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt T=5: min= -29+24= -5, max= -18+24=6, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt T=3: min= -29+12= -17, max= -18+12= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nT=6: min= -29+30=1, max= -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow, other cars on freeway 3: the first two don't cover 0, so only this one matters.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 4: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6) same as freeway 3.\n\nSo occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car (54,43,right,6)\n\nAs above, min at T=1 is 43, increasing, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, (54,43,right,6), never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 7: (54,43,right,6), same, never.\n\nFreeway 8: (54,43,right,6), same, never.\n\nSo summary of occupied freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=2\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at T=2\n\nFreeway 3: occupied at T=4,5\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=4,5\n\nFreeway 5-8: never occupied\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at T=1 (t=0).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn, so minimum 9 turns to go from 0 to 9, with all up moves.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T = k for k=1-8, and k is occupied at T, then collision.\n\nAlso, note that at y=0 and y=9, no freeway, so no collision possible there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, we start at T=1, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to end at some T=H, y_H=9, safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are when we are on y=1-8 at certain turns.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- At T=2, freeway 1 and 2 are occupied, so if y=1 or 2 at T=2, collision.\n\n- At T=4, freeway 3 and 4 occupied, so if y=3 or 4 at T=4, collision.\n\n- At T=5, freeway 3 and 4 occupied, so if y=3 or 4 at T=5, collision.\n\nOther times, freeways are safe, except that freeways 5-8 are always safe since never occupied.\n\nBut at T=4 and 5, y=3 and 4 are dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at T=2, y=1 and 2 dangerous.\n\nNow, we need to plan a path from y=0 at T=1 to y=9 at some T=H.\n\nSince we can move up, down, or stay, we can delay or avoid being at certain positions at certain times.\n\nMinimal H is 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut check if possible without collision.\n\nStart: T=1, y=0 (safe)\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 at T=2.\n\nT=2 is turn 2.\n\nAt time t=0 (T=1), y_0=0\n\nTake action a_0, then y_1 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, at time t, y_t at turn T=t1+t=1+t.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_{T-1}? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn number T corresponds to time index? Better to use turn number.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nGiven at turn T=1, y_1 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_T at turn T, y_{T+1} is determined.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with a_t at time t.\n\nBut time t corresponds to turn t1+t.\n\nSet turn T from 1.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, affecting y_{T+1}.\n\nSo y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, where Δy_T based on a_T.\n\nAnd collision at turn T based on y_T.\n\nGiven at T=1, y_1 = 0.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nActions from T=1 to T=H-1, so H-1 actions to go to y_H from y_1.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end: from T=1 to T=H, we have H-1 actions.\n\ny_1 to y_H with H-1 steps.\n\nDistance in y: from 0 to 9, difference 9, so min steps: 9 if all up.\n\nNow, positions over time.\n\nList turns T=1,2,3,...\n\nAt T=1, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- At T=2, if y=1 or y=2, collision because freeway 1 or 2 occupied.\n\n- At T=4, if y=3 or y=4, collision (freeway 3 or 4 occupied)\n\n- At T=5, if y=3 or y=4, collision\n\nOther times and positions are safe, since freeways 5-8 always safe.\n\nFreeway 5-8 never occupied, so y=5,6,7,8 always safe at any time.\n\ny=1 and 2 are only dangerous at T=2.\n\ny=3 and 4 dangerous at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow, we want to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal path: go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at T=2, we cannot be at y=1 or 2.\n\nAt T=1, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_1 at T=1, y_2 at T=2.\n\nIf we go up at T=1, a_1=U, then y_2 = y_1 +1 = 0+1=1.\n\nBut at T=2, y=1, which is freeway 1, occupied at T=2, collision.\n\nIf we stay, a_1=S, y_2=0, safe, but still at y=0.\n\nIf down, but y=0, cannot go down, since y in [0,9], probably cannot go below, so Δy=0 if down at y=0.\n\nSimilarly for up at y=9.\n\nSo at T=1, options:\n\n- U: y_2=1, but at T=2, y=1, collision.\n\n- S: y_2=0, safe, but no progress.\n\n- D: y_2=0, same as S.\n\nSo only safe is to stay or down, y_2=0.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0.\n\nNow at T=2, we take action for y_3.\n\nWe want to avoid being at y=1 or 2 at T=2, but we are at y=0, so safe.\n\nNow at T=2, position y=0.\n\nAction a_2: if U, y_3=1; S, y_3=0; D, y_3=0.\n\nWe need to go up eventually.\n\nBut at later times, we have issues at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose we stay at T=1, so y_2=0 at T=2.\n\nNow at T=2, we can go up: a_2=U, then y_3=1 at T=3.\n\nT=3, y=1.\n\nIs freeway 1 occupied at T=3? Earlier, for freeway 1, only occupied at T=2, so at T=3, not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 only at T=2.\n\nSo at T=3, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we have T=4 and T=5 where y=3 and 4 are dangerous.\n\nNow, timeline:\n\nT=1: y=0\n\nT=2: y=0 (after staying)\n\nT=3: y=1 (if we go up at T=2)\n\nNow at T=3, we can go up to y=2 at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, if y=2, is it dangerous? Freeway 2 occupied only at T=2, not at T=4, so y=2 at T=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=4 would be dangerous, but we are at y=2.\n\ny=2 at T=4 is freeway 2, which is only occupied at T=2, so safe.\n\nNow action at T=3: if U, y_4=2 at T=4.\n\nT=4: y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, action a_4: we can go up to y=3 at T=5.\n\nBut at T=5, y=3 would be dangerous because freeway 3 occupied at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=3 at T=5, collision.\n\nWe could stay or go down, but we need to go up.\n\nSince y=3 and 4 are dangerous only at T=4 and T=5, we can be at other positions.\n\nAt T=4, y=2 (as above)\n\nThen at T=4, if we go up, y_5=3 at T=5, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we stay, y_5=2 at T=5.\n\ny=2 at T=5: freeway 2, occupied only at T=2, not at T=5, so safe.\n\nBut we are stuck at y=2.\n\nWe need to go up eventually.\n\nBut at T=5, if we go up, y_6=3 at T=6.\n\nT=6: y=3, freeway 3 occupied at T=4 and 5, but not at T=6? For freeway 3, occupied at T=4 and 5 only.\n\nAt T=6, not occupied, so y=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nStart:\n\nT=1: y=0\n\na_1=S (or D, but same), so y_2=0 at T=2\n\nT=2: y=0\n\na_2=U, so y_3=1 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=1\n\na_3=U, so y_4=2 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=2\n\nNow at T=4, we cannot go up to y=3 at T=5 because T=5 y=3 collision.\n\nSo we must not go to y=3 or 4 at T=5.\n\nOptions at T=4: a_4\n\nIf U, y_5=3, collision at T=5\n\nIf S, y_5=2\n\nIf D, y_5=1\n\ny_5=2 or 1 at T=5.\n\ny=1 at T=5: freeway 1, occupied only at T=2, so safe.\n\ny=2 at T=5, similarly safe.\n\nSay we stay: a_4=S, y_5=2 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=2\n\nThen at T=5, we can go up: a_5=U, y_6=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, freeway 3 not occupied (only at T=4,5), so safe.\n\nThen continue: a_5=U? At T=5, a_5=U, y_6=3\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, safe.\n\nNow go up: a_6=U, y_7=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, freeway 4 occupied at T=4 and 5, not at T=7, so safe.\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=5 at T=8\n\ny=5, freeway 5 always safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=6 at T=9\n\na_9=U, y_10=7 at T=10\n\na_10=U, y_11=8 at T=11\n\na_11=U, y_12=9 at T=12\n\nNow y=9, reached at T=12.\n\nBut H is the turn when we reach y=9, so T=12.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=1 to T=11, 11 actions.\n\nBut we started at T=1 y=0, ended T=12 y=9.\n\nMinimal could be less.\n\nWe wasted some time staying.\n\nAt T=4, instead of staying, we could go down to delay.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=2 we were forced to stay at y=0, but we could have gone down if possible, but y=0, cannot go down.\n\nAt T=1, if we go up, we collide at T=2, so must not go up at T=1.\n\nSo we had to stay at T=1.\n\nAt T=2, we went up to y=1 at T=3.\n\nCould we go directly to higher y?\n\nBut we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nTo avoid y=3 and 4 at T=4 and T=5, we need to be not at those positions at those times.\n\nT=4 and T=5 are consecutive, so we cannot be at y=3 or 4 on both turns, but since we move one step, we might skip or stay away.\n\nFor example, if at T=3 we are at y=2, then at T=4 we can go to y=3 or stay or down.\n\nBut if we go to y=3 at T=4, collision.\n\nIf we stay, y=2 at T=4, safe, but then at T=5, if we go to y=3, but T=5 y=3 collision, or stay y=2, then later go to y=3 at T=6, safe.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf at T=3 we are at y=1, then at T=4 we can go to y=2 (safe), then T=5 to y=3, but T=5 y=3 collision, so must not go to y=3 at T=5.\n\nSo we have to be at y<=2 at T=4 and T=5, or y>=5, but we are at low y.\n\nFrom above, at T=3, we have y=1.\n\nThen at T=4, we can be y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0: but we need to go up, might be slow.\n\ny=1 or 2.\n\nIf y=2 at T=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, we can be y=1,2,3.\n\nBut y=3 dangerous at T=5, so we must be y=1 or 2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=6, go to y=3, safe.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=4 to y=2 at T=5, we stay, then to y=3 at T=6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo save time, at T=4, from y=2, if we go up to y=3 at T=5, collision, not possible.\n\nSo we must delay.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=3 before T=4 or after T=5.\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=1 or 2, cannot be higher.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=3, y=1.\n\nWe could have gone faster earlier, but at T=1 we had to stay, so at T=2 y=0, T=3 y=1, that's the fastest to y=1.\n\nAt T=2, from y=0, we could go up to y=1 at T=3, as we did.\n\nIf at T=2 we stay, y=0 at T=3, then later, but slower.\n\nSo best is to go up as much as possible except when forced to avoid.\n\nBut at T=4, from y=2, we cannot go up because it would lead to y=3 at T=5, collision.\n\nSo we stay at y=2 for T=4 and T=5? Not necessarily, we can go down or something, but going down might not help.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, we can go down to y=1 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, go up to y=2 at T=6, then up to y=3 at T=7, etc., but slower than staying at y=2.\n\nIn the first sequence, by staying at y=2 for T=5, we go to y=3 at T=6.\n\nIf we go down at T=4 to y=1 at T=5, then to y=2 at T=6, then to y=3 at T=7, which is later.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, the sequence I had is better: stay at y=2 for T=4 and T=5, then go up.\n\nIn that sequence:\n\nT=1: y=0\n\na1=S, y2=0\n\nT=2: y=0\n\na2=U, y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1\n\na3=U, y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2\n\na4=S, y5=2  (stay to avoid going to y=3 at T=5)\n\nT=5: y=2\n\na5=U, y6=3\n\nT=6: y=3\n\na6=U, y7=4\n\nT=7: y=4\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\nT=8: y=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\nT=9: y=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\nT=10: y=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\nT=11: y=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nT=12: y=9\n\nReached at T=12.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=3 at T=3, but we cannot, because at T=3 we are at y=1.\n\nAt T=1, we must stay to avoid y=1 at T=2.\n\nBut is there another way?\n\nSuppose at T=1, we go down, but y=0, cannot go down, so only stay.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster by skipping the dangerous zones.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 5-8 are always safe, we can go through them faster, but we need to pass the lower freeways.\n\nThe dangerous times are only at specific points.\n\nAt T=4 and T=5, y=3 and 4 dangerous, but we are at y=2 at that time, which is fine.\n\nBut we lost time at the beginning by staying at T=1.\n\nIs it possible to not stay at T=1?\n\nAt T=1, if we go up, we are at y=1 at T=2, collision, not possible.\n\nSo must stay or equivalent at T=1.\n\nThus, we start moving only from T=2.\n\nThen we reach y=1 at T=3, y=2 at T=4.\n\nThen we have to stay at y=2 during T=5? In above, at T=4 y=2, and we stay so y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen to y=3 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=4, if we could go to y=3, but at T=4, if y=3, it is dangerous because freeway 3 occupied at T=4.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=4, we are at y=2, not y=3.\n\nIf we were at y=3 at T=4, collision, but we are not.\n\nCan we be at y=4 or something earlier? No.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly from y=0 to higher, but no, only one step.\n\nAnother thought: at T=2, since we are at y=0, and we go up to y=1 at T=3.\n\nBut at T=2, we could do nothing else.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=2 earlier, but no.\n\nSo the minimal H might be 12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce by going faster later or something.\n\nAfter passing the danger, from y=2 at T=5 to y=9, we need 7 steps: to y=3 at T=6, y=4 at T=7, ..., y=9 at T=11? Let's count.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=5, to y=3 at T=6, y=4 at T=7, y=5 at T=8, y=6 at T=9, y=7 at T=10, y=8 at T=11, y=9 at T=12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we can be at higher y at T=5.\n\nBut at T=5, we are at y=2.\n\nAt T=4, we were at y=2, if we go up, to y=3 at T=5, collision, not possible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid staying at T=1 by going down, but cannot.\n\nSo I think H=12 is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points again.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 occupied only at T=2, so y=1 or 2 at T=2 dangerous.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 occupied at T=4 and T=5, so y=3 or 4 at T=4 or T=5 dangerous.\n\nIn our path, we are not at those positions at those times.\n\nAt T=2, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, which is freeway 2, but occupied only at T=2, not at T=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=5, y=2, same.\n\nThen we proceed.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after that, but we are going up every turn from T=5 to T=12, but with 7 steps to gain 7 levels.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, delta=7, min 7 steps, so cannot faster.\n\nBut we started late.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go up at T=1 to y=1 at T=2, but collision, not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at T=2, then go up to y=1 at T=3, as before.\n\nBut at T=3, y=1, we can go up to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen instead of staying, if we could go to y=4 directly, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 at T=5, but T=5 y=3 collision.\n\nUnless we can make T=5 not dangerous for y=3, but it is occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=5 faster by going through other paths, but we have to go through y=3 and 4 eventually.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 always safe, but we need to get to them.\n\nThe bottleneck is at the beginning.\n\nWe can consider staying at y=0 longer, but that would be worse.\n\nOr going down, but y=0 min.\n\nSo I think minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn T=1: action a1, which is S or D, but D same as S at y=0.\n\nThen y2=0.\n\nTurn T=2: action a2=U, y3=1\n\nTurn T=3: action a3=U, y4=2\n\nTurn T=4: action a4=S, y5=2\n\nTurn T=5: action a5=U, y6=3\n\nTurn T=6: action a6=U, y7=4\n\nTurn T=7: action a7=U, y8=5\n\nTurn T=8: action a8=U, y9=6\n\nTurn T=9: action a9=U, y10=7\n\nTurn T=10: action a10=U, y11=8\n\nTurn T=11: action a11=U, y12=9\n\nReached at T=12.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=1 to T=11, 11 actions.\n\nH is the number such that y_H=9, so H=12.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 or something.\n\nt1=1, we need to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 for a_{t1+t}, and position at turn t1+t.\n\nAt time t=0, turn t1+0 = t1, position given.\n\nAfter actions up to t=H-1, position at turn t1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nSet: at turn τ = t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ at turn τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nGiven y_{t1} at turn t1.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9?

Let's see.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=1, so y_{1 + H -1} = y_H =9.\n\nSo H is the turn number where we reach y=9.\n\nIn my notation, T=12, so H=12.\n\nActions: from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -2 =1 to 10? t1 + H -2 =1 +12-2=11.\n\nActions at turn 1 to 11.\n\nNumber of actions: H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-2? t from 0 to H-2.\n\nSet t from 0.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to K, where K+1 actions.\n\nAfter K+1 actions, we reach y_{t1 + K +1}? Messy.\n\nFrom the problem: actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, which are H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t} at turn τ = t1 + t, it affects y_{τ +1} = y_{t1 + t +1}.\n\nAfter all actions up to t=H-1, which is at turn t1 + H -1, it affects y_{t1 + H}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nFor example, after no actions, at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1} at turn t1, we have y_{t1 +1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -2} at turn t1 + H -2, we have y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen we don't need action at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo the sequence should be actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -2, total H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which includes t=H-1, turn t1 + H -1, which is extra.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake, or perhaps for the action at turn t1 + H -1, we can set it to anything, but it doesn't affect the position at t1 + H -1.\n\nTo be consistent, in the answer, we should list actions from turn t1 to the turn before reaching.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn my case, t1=1, H=12, reach at turn 12.\n\nActions from turn 1 to turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, 11 actions, from t=0 to t=10 for a_{t1+t}, since t from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nt=0: turn t1+0=1, a1\n\nt=1: turn 2, a2\n\n...\n\nt=10: turn 11, a11\n\nAfter a11 at turn 11, y12=9.\n\nAnd H=12.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions for turn t1 to t1 +10, which is turn 1 to 11.\n\nFor the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn my sequence, I have:\n\nTurn 1: S (or D, but S is fine)\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn 11.\n\nBut for turn 11, action a11=U, which sets y12= y11 +1.\n\nIn the position, at turn 11, y11=8 (from previous), then a11=U, y12=9.\n\nWe reach at turn 12.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we can avoid the stay at T=4.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=1 at T=4.\n\nAt T=3, we are at y=1, if we stay, y=1 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=1, safe, since freeway 1 not occupied except T=2.\n\nThen at T=4, we can go up to y=2 at T=5.\n\nT=5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, go up to y=3 at T=6, safe, as before.\n\nBut then from y=1 at T=4 to y=2 at T=5, then y=3 at T=6, same as before, but we were at y=1 at T=4 instead of y=2.\n\nIn previous, at T=4 we were at y=2.\n\nNow if at T=4 we are at y=1, then:\n\nT=1: y=0, a1=S, y2=0\n\nT=2: y=0, a2=U, y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1, a3=S, y4=1  (stay instead of up)\n\nT=4: y=1, safe\n\na4=U, y5=2 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=2, safe\n\na5=U, y6=3 at T=6\n\nThen same as before, y6=3, etc., to y12=9.\n\nBut we reached y=3 at T=6 same, but at T=4 we are at y=1 instead of y=2, so we are lower, and it will take longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=4 to y=9: y=1 T=4, y=2 T=5, y=3 T=6, ..., up to y=9 at T=12, same as before.\n\nT=4 y=1, T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, T=7 y=4, ..., T=12 y=9, still 12.\n\nIn the first sequence, T=4 y=2, T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, so at T=5 we are at y=2, which is better than y=1, but we stayed, so position same at later times.\n\nNo gain.\n\nTo reach earlier, we need to be higher at earlier turns.\n\nBut at T=2, we must be at y=0 to avoid collision, so we cannot be higher than y=1 at T=3, etc.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be at y=3 at T=3.\n\nBut at T=3, from start, with two moves: from T=1 to T=2, we can go to y=1, but at T=2 y=1 collision, so we stay, y=0 at T=2, then at T=3 y=1, so y=3 at T=3 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nThus, H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the actions, we can choose to stay or down at y=0, but down same as stay.\n\nSo use S.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 4, we stay, but we could go down, but worse.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, we have multiple cars, but only one covered 0, which we considered.\n\nNow, output.\n\nt1=1.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 11, action U, which sets y12=9.\n\nBut we need to list up to which turn?\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 1 to turn 11, as above.\n\nH=12, so turns from t1 to t1 + H -2 =1 to 10? t1 + H -2 =1+12-2=11, yes.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the box, we need to write the actions.\n\nAlso, for the collision note: when moving, we are not on the new freeway until next turn, but in this case, when we move, for example, from y=2 to y=3, at turn T, we are at y=2, then action U, so at turn T, position y=2, we are on freeway 2, which may or may not be occupied, but in our case, at that turn, we are on current y.\n\nWhen we take action to move, at the same turn, we are still on the current position.\n\nOnly after the action, position changes for next turn.\n\nSo in collision check, at turn T, position y_T is used to determine if on freeway.\n\nIn our sequence, no issue.\n\nSpecifically, at T=4, y=2, we take S, so at T=4, position y=2, freeway 2, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen y5=2 at T=5, same.\n\nNo problem.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose reach at turn 11.\n\nThen y11=9.\n\nThen from y1=0 to y11=9, min 10 steps, but with obstacles.\n\ny11=9, so actions from turn 1 to turn 10, 10 actions.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + delta, from t=1 to 10, y11 from y1=0.\n\ny11 = y1 + sum delta from t=1 to 10.\n\nTo have y11=9, sum delta =9.\n\nEach delta <=1, so at least 9 up moves, and one stay or down, but since sum=9, all must be up, no stay or down.\n\nSo must have 10 actions, all U, y from 0 to 1 at T=2, to ... y=10 at T=11, but y max=9, so y11=9, which requires from y1=0, after 10 steps all U, y11=10, which is invalid, since y<=9.\n\ny11 = y1 + sum_{t=1 to 10} delta_t\n\ny1=0, y11=9, so sum delta_t =9.\n\nEach delta_t in {-1,0,1}, so to have sum=9 with 10 terms, possible only if nine +1 and one 0, or eight +1 and two 0, etc., but min number of +1 is 9, so must have nine U and one S or D.\n\nBut if D, sum less, so must have nine U and one S.\n\nThen y sequence: start y1=0, after actions, y11=9.\n\nThe S action must be at some point.\n\nBut with S, we have a stay, so it takes 11 turns to go from 0 to 9 with one stay.\n\nBut in terms of time, from T=1 to T=11, with positions.\n\ny1=0\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\n...\n\nAfter a10, y11.\n\ny11=9.\n\nNow, the stay causes a repeated position.\n\nNow, collision points: at T=2, if y2=1 or 2, collision.\n\nBut y2: after a1, y2 = y1 + delta1.\n\nIf a1=U, y2=1, but at T=2, y=1, collision, not possible.\n\nIf a1=S, y2=0.\n\nSimilarly, if a1=D, y2=0.\n\nSo must have a1=S or D, so y2=0.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0.\n\nThen a2, etc.\n\nNow, we need to reach y11=9 with only one stay and nine up.\n\nThe stay must be at some turn.\n\nNow, at T=4 and T=5, we need to avoid y=3 or 4.\n\nSuppose we have a1=S, so y2=0.\n\nThen we need to go up nine times in the next 9 actions? Actions a2 to a10.\n\na2 to a10: nine actions, but we need to increase by 9, from y2=0 to y11=9, so must all be U, no stay possible.\n\ny11 = y2 + sum_{t=2 to 10} delta_t\n\ny2=0, y11=9, so sum_{t=2 to 10} delta_t =9, with nine actions (t=2 to 10), so all must be U.\n\nThus, y3=1, y4=2, y5=3, y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt T=2: y2=0, safe.\n\nT=3: y3=1, freeway 1, not occupied at T=3, safe.\n\nT=4: y4=2, freeway 2, not occupied at T=4, safe.\n\nT=5: y5=3, freeway 3, occupied at T=5, collision!\n\nOh, at T=5, y=3, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf we place the stay elsewhere, but we have no stay; in this case, with H=11, we must have the sequence above except with a1=S, but then y5=3 at T=5, collision.\n\nIf we don't have a1=S, but we must, because if a1=U, collision at T=2.\n\nSo impossible for H=11.\n\nWith more stays, but for H=11, we need exactly one stay to have y11=9 from y1=0 with 10 actions.\n\nBut with that, y5=3 at T=5, collision.\n\nIf we have the stay later, but in the sequence above, with all up after y2=0, we must be at y=3 at T=5.\n\nT=1: y1=0, a1=S, y2=0\n\nT=2: y2=0, a2=U, y3=1\n\nT=3: y3=1, a3=U, y4=2\n\nT=4: y4=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5: y5=3, collision\n\nYes.\n\nIf we have the stay at a different point.\n\nSuppose we have the stay at a4.\n\nBut with only one stay.\n\na1 must be S, so y2=0.\n\nThen a2 to a10 all U except one S.\n\nBut sum delta from a2 to a10 must be 9 with 9 actions, so no S, all U.\n\nThus, cannot have another stay; must be all U from a2 to a10.\n\nThus y5=3 at T=5, collision inevitable for H=11.\n\nTherefore, H=11 impossible.\n\nH=12 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the output, for turn t1=1 to turn 11.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 4 is S, which is stay at y=2.\n\nWe could have turn 4 as D, going to y=1 at T=5, but then slower, as before.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nAlso, H=12.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut for turn 11, action U, which sets y12=9.\n\nAnd H=12.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 11 actions, from turn 1 to 11.\n\nIn the problem, it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, with H=12, t from 0 to 11, which is 12 actions, but for t=11, a_{t1+11}=a_{12}, at turn 12, which affects y13, not needed.\n\nBut in the answer, since we list up to the action that sets the position, probably we should list only up to turn 11.\n\nIn the format example, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., without specifying end, so we list all actions that affect up to the reaching turn.\n\nI think for turn 12, no action needed, as position is already set.\n\nSo in the sequence, we list actions from turn 1 to 11.\n\nThus, the above.\n\nTo confirm, with this, at turn 12, y=9.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, not on freeway.\n\nT=4, y=2, freeway 2 not occupied.\n\nT=5, y=2, same.\n\nT=4 and T=5, we are at y=2, not 3 or 4.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 12, meaning the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The car states indicate that:\n- Freeways 1 and 2 are occupied only at turn 2, so being at \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at turn 2 causes a collision.\n- Freeways 3 and 4 are occupied at turns 4 and 5, so being at \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\) at these turns causes a collision.\n- Freeways 5 to 8 are never occupied, so they are always safe.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 1. To avoid collision at turn 2, the player must not be at \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\), so the action at turn 1 must be \"S\" (stay), resulting in \\(y = 0\\) at turn 2. Then, the player moves up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3 and \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4, both safe since freeways 1 and 2 are not occupied at these turns. At turn 4, \\(y = 2\\) is safe, but moving up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5 would cause a collision (since freeway 3 is occupied at turn 5). Thus, the player stays at turn 4, remaining at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 5, which is safe. From turn 5 onward, the player moves up each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 without further collisions, as freeways 3 and 4 are safe after turn 5, and freeways 5 to 8 are always safe.\n\nThe action sequence for turns 1 to 11 is as follows:\n\n- Turn 1: Stay (S) to avoid moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2 (collision risk).\n- Turn 2: Up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3 (safe).\n- Turn 3: Up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4 (safe).\n- Turn 4: Stay (S) to avoid moving to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5 (collision risk).\n- Turn 5: Up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 6 (safe, as freeway 3 not occupied).\n- Turn 6: Up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 7 (safe, as freeway 4 not occupied).\n- Turn 7: Up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 8 (safe).\n- Turn 8: Up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9 (safe).\n- Turn 9: Up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10 (safe).\n- Turn 10: Up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11 (safe).\n- Turn 11: Up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 with no collisions, and \\(H = 12\\) is minimal because \\(H = 11\\) would require moving up from turn 2 to turn 11 with only one stay, but this forces \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5 (collision) or other conflicts.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=2, and I start at y=0. The goal is to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with given speeds, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of some car on the freeway y_T at that turn. Also, when I move to a different row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only need to worry about the row I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn number relative to t_1. Since t_1=2, let τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to find actions for τ=0 to τ=H-1, and y_H =9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, and I can only change y by -1, 0, or +1 each turn, the minimum number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns if I always go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut since the grid is small, only 10 rows, and cars might block, I need to find a path.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nThe car states are given for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -24, tail 11, direction left, speed 36.\n\nSince it's left-moving, direction left means it's moving to decreasing x.\n\nThe span is [h, τ] for left-moving, but in the update, for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nt1 is 2, so for turn T, time elapsed is T - 2.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: car: h=-24, τ=11, d=left, s=36\n\nAt turn T, span = [h - s(T-2), τ - s(T-2)] = [-24 - 36(T-2), 11 - 36(T-2)]\n\nSince it's left-moving, and head is at -24, tail at 11, but usually head is the front, so if moving left, head should be on the right? I think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn the initial state, h and τ are given.\n\nFor freeway 1: h=-24, τ=11, both negative? But tail at 11, which is positive? That seems odd.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted.\n\nSpan(t1) = [h, τ] with h and τ, and for left-moving, it decreases.\n\nBut -24 to 11, that's from negative to positive, so at t1=2, the car covers from x=-24 to x=11? That's a length of 35? 11 - (-24) = 35, and speed 36, but car length should be consistent.\n\nSpeed is 36, but in one turn, it moves 36 units, which is larger than the span? I think the span is the positions it occupies, so the length is |h - τ| + 1 or something? But in the collision, it's if 0 is in the interval.\n\nFor simplicity, since we care about when 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nFreeway 1: car at t1=2: span [-24,11], left-moving, s=36.\n\nSo at time T, span [ -24 -36(T-2) , 11 -36(T-2) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is the same: [-24,11], left, s=36.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (60,49, right,6), (24,13, right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the notation: \"right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\"\n\nFor first car on freeway 3: (60,49, right,6), so τ=49, h=60? Span [τ,h] = [49,60] at t1.\n\nThen at T, [49 + 6(T-2), 60 + 6(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), so [13,24] at t1, since [τ,h] for right-moving.\n\nτ=13, h=24, so [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 + 6(T-2), 24 + 6(T-2)]\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6), τ=-23, h=-12, so span [-23,-12] at t1.\n\nAt T, [-23 + 6(T-2), -12 + 6(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same as freeway 3: three cars with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 4: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car (60,49,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (60,49,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (60,49,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (60,49,right,6)\n\nAll freeways from 5 to 8 have only one car each, with (60,49,right,6)\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at τ=0 (turn t1=2).\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway row, I must ensure that at that turn, no car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nSince I move after the car update? The sequence: at each turn, cars move to their new positions based on the turn, then I choose action, which updates my position for the next turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T when I am on y_T.\n\nLet me see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T, and 0 in span for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo, at the beginning of turn T, cars are at positions for turn T, then I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, but for collision, it's based on y_T and car positions at T.\n\nWhen I am at position (0, y_T) at turn T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, I must not have collision, meaning no car on freeway y_T at turn T covers x=0.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible, I think. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at y=0 at τ=0, which is turn 2, and I need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt y=0, I can stay or move up to y=1.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, I can be done.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway row, at which turns x=0 is covered by a car, so I cannot be on that row at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move, I need the times when 0 is occupied for each row.\n\nLet me define the time relative to τ=0, which is turn t=2.\n\nSo let t_rel = T - 2, so at t_rel=0, turn 2.\n\nThen for each freeway, for each car, find when 0 is in the span.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, span at t_rel: [ -24 -36 t_rel , 11 -36 t_rel ]  because Δt = T-2 = t_rel\n\nAt turn T, span [h - s (T-2), τ - s (T-2)] = [-24 -36 t_rel, 11 -36 t_rel]\n\nSet 0 in this interval:\n\n-24 -36 t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36 t_rel\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n-24 -36 t_rel ≤ 0 => -36 t_rel ≤ 24 => t_rel ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, but t_rel ≥0, so always true for t_rel ≥0? No.\n\n-24 -36 t_rel ≤ 0 => -36 t_rel ≤ 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36 t_rel ≥ -24 => t_rel ≥ -24/36 = -2/3\n\nSince t_rel ≥0, this is always true.\n\nThen 0 ≤ 11 -36 t_rel => 36 t_rel ≤ 11 => t_rel ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nAlso, since it's ≤ and ≥, and t_rel integer? Turns are discrete, I think t_rel integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt_rel is turn offset, integer, starting from 0.\n\nSo t_rel = 0,1,2,3,...\n\nAt t_rel=0: span [ -24 -0, 11-0] = [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt t_rel=1: [ -24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], 0 not in [-60,-25]\n\nAt t_rel=0: -24 ≤ 0 ≤ 11, yes.\n\nt_rel=1: -60 ≤ 0 ≤ -25? 0 ≤ -25 false, so no.\n\nt_rel=0 is the only time when 0 is covered for this car on freeway 1.\n\nt_rel ≤ 11/36 ≈0.305, so only t_rel=0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2, same car, same thing, only at t_rel=0, 0 is covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, (60,49,right,6), span at t_rel: [49 + 6 t_rel, 60 + 6 t_rel] since [τ + s t_rel, h + s t_rel]\n\nτ=49, h=60, s=6, so [49 + 6 t_rel, 60 + 6 t_rel]\n\n0 in [49+6t_rel, 60+6t_rel] ?\n\n49+6t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ 60+6t_rel ?\n\nBut 49+6t_rel ≥49 >0 for t_rel≥0, so left part 49+6t_rel ≤0 false, so never for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), span [13 + 6 t_rel, 24 + 6 t_rel]\n\n0 in [13+6t_rel, 24+6t_rel]? 13+6t_rel ≥13>0, so never.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6), τ=-23, h=-12, so span [-23 + 6 t_rel, -12 + 6 t_rel]\n\n0 in [-23+6t_rel, -12+6t_rel] ?\n\nSo -23+6t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ -12+6t_rel\n\nFirst, -23+6t_rel ≤ 0 => 6t_rel ≤ 23 => t_rel ≤ 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -12+6t_rel => 12 ≤ 6t_rel => t_rel ≥ 2\n\nSo for t_rel ≥2 and t_rel ≤3.833, so t_rel=2,3\n\nAt t_rel=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, since it says \"in the span\", and span is inclusive I assume.\n\nSimilarly, at t_rel=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], -5 ≤ 0 ≤ 6, yes.\n\nAt t_rel=4: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nSo for freeway 3, third car covers 0 at t_rel=2 and 3.\n\nFirst and second cars never cover 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 has collision at t_rel=2 and 3.\n\nt_rel is offset from turn 2, so at absolute turn T=4 and T=5 (since t_rel=2 is T=4, t_rel=3 is T=5)\n\nt_rel=0: turn 2\n\nt_rel=1: turn 3\n\nt_rel=2: turn 4\n\nt_rel=3: turn 5\n\netc.\n\nFor freeway 3, at t_rel=2 (turn 4) and t_rel=3 (turn 5), x=0 is covered.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so also at t_rel=2 and 3, collision possible from the third car.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (60,49,right,6), span [49 + 6 t_rel, 60 + 6 t_rel], always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8: same, one car with [49+6t_rel,60+6t_rel], min is 49>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo only freeways 1,2,3,4 have possible collisions at certain times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFreeway 1: collision at t_rel=0 (turn 2)\n\nFreeway 2: collision at t_rel=0 (turn 2)\n\nFreeway 3: collision at t_rel=2 (turn 4) and t_rel=3 (turn 5)\n\nFreeway 4: collision at t_rel=2 (turn 4) and t_rel=3 (turn 5)\n\nFreeways 5-8: no collision at any time.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at τ=0 (turn 2, t_rel=0).\n\nAt this turn, I am at y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nI need to choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, I move to y=1 at next turn, but at turn 2, I choose action, which affects y for turn 3.\n\nRecall:\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and car positions at T.\n\nAt turn T=2 (t_rel=0), I am at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, if I choose a_{t1} = U, then y_{3} = 0 +1 =1.\n\nBut at turn 3, I will be at y=1.\n\nNow, turn 3 is t_rel=1.\n\nWhat about freeway 1 at t_rel=1?\n\nEarlier, for freeway 1, at t_rel=1, span was [-60,-25], 0 not covered, so no collision at t_rel=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nBut at t_rel=1, is there any issue?\n\nFreeway 1: at t_rel=0, collision, but t_rel=1, no.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 at t_rel=1: t_rel=1 is turn 3.\n\nFor freeway 3, we have collision at t_rel=2 and 3, not at t_rel=1.\n\nt_rel=1 is turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, freeway 3: cars positions.\n\nFirst car: [49+6(1),60+6(1)]=[55,66] no\n\nSecond: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30] no\n\nThird: [-23+6, -12+6]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, so no collision on freeway 3 at t_rel=1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same.\n\nFreeways 5-8 no issue.\n\nSo at turn 3 (t_rel=1), all freeways are safe for x=0.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at turn 3, it should be fine.\n\nBut I start at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAction at turn 2: if I choose U, then y_{3} =1.\n\nThen at turn 3, I am at y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway, so I need no collision at turn 3 on freeway 1.\n\nAs above, at t_rel=1, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, y_{3}=0, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nOr down, but y=0 is bottom, if I go down, y=-1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=-1, not allowed, so I cannot go down from y=0. Similarly, from y=9, cannot go up.\n\nSo at y=0, actions D is invalid, or implicitly, y stays 0 if action would make it out of bound? The equation says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably it clamps.\n\nBut in the update, it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy_t=-1, y_{t+1} = -1, but must be in [0,9], so perhaps it sets to 0 or something. But to be safe, I should avoid actions that would go out of bound.\n\nSimilarly for y=9 and U.\n\nIn this case, at y=0, only S or U possible, D not allowed.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, only S or D, U not allowed.\n\nBut here I start at y=0.\n\nBack to action at turn 2 (τ=0).\n\nI can choose U or S.\n\nIf U, y_{3}=1.\n\nThen at turn 3 (t_rel=1), I am at y=1, freeway 1 is safe, no collision.\n\nThen I can choose to go up or stay.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are for freeway 3 and 4 at t_rel=2 and 3, i.e., turn 4 and 5.\n\nAt turn 4 (t_rel=2), freeway 3 and 4 have collision at x=0.\n\nSimilarly turn 5 (t_rel=3).\n\nNow, I need to make sure that when I am on y=3 or y=4 at those turns, I avoid.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt turn 4, if I am on y=3 or y=4, I collide.\n\nSimilarly turn 5.\n\nNow, other rows are safe at those times.\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 are safe after t_rel=0.\n\nFreeways 5-8 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to plan the path.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and go up.\n\nThe minimum H is 9 turns if I go up directly, but I might be blocked at some point.\n\nFor example, if I go up each turn, I reach y=9 at turn 11 or something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 2 (τ=0): y=0, safe. Action: say U, then y_{3}=1\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): y=1, freeway 1 safe. Action U, y_{4}=2\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): y=2, freeway 2. Is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 4: t_rel=2, freeway 2 has car, but at t_rel=2, for freeway 2, we had only collision at t_rel=0, not at t_rel=2.\n\nFreeway 2: similar to freeway 1, only at t_rel=0 collision.\n\nAt t_rel=2, span: for freeway 2, car: left-moving, s=36, span at t_rel: [-24 -36t_rel, 11-36t_rel]\n\nAt t_rel=2: [-24-72, 11-72] = [-96, -61], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSo at turn 4, y=2, freeway 2 safe.\n\nAction U, y_{5}=3\n\nTurn 5 (τ=3): y=3, freeway 3. Now turn 5 is t_rel=3.\n\nAt t_rel=3, freeway 3 has collision because of third car, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt t_rel=3, freeway 3: third car span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nSo if I am on y=3 at turn 5, I collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I continue up, at turn 5 y=3, collision.\n\nIf at turn 4, I don't go to y=3, but stay or something.\n\nBut at turn 4, y=2, if I stay, y_{5}=2, then at turn 5, y=2, which is freeway 2, safe, as above.\n\nThen later I need to go up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, freeway 3 and 4 are dangerous at turn 4 and 5.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 4 (t_rel=2), freeway 3 and 4 are dangerous.\n\nAt turn 5 (t_rel=3), freeway 3 and 4 are dangerous.\n\nAt other times, they might be safe.\n\nFor example, at turn 3 (t_rel=1), freeway 3: as before, cars at [55,66], [19,30], [-17,-6], all not cover 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same.\n\nAt turn 6 (t_rel=4), freeway 3: first car [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] no, second [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] no, third [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12] no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4.\n\nSo freeway 3 and 4 are only dangerous at turn 4 and 5.\n\nTo avoid collision, I must not be on y=3 or y=4 at turn 4, and not on y=3 or y=4 at turn 5.\n\nBecause both rows are dangerous at both turns.\n\ny=3 at turn 4 or 5: collision\n\ny=4 at turn 4 or 5: collision\n\nNow, I need to be on other rows at those turns.\n\nNow, I start from y=0 at turn 2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence of y positions over turns.\n\nLet me list turns from turn 2 onwards.\n\nTurn | y at start of turn | action | y for next turn\n\nBut y at turn T is position at beginning of turn T.\n\nAfter action, y_{T+1} set.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, y_T matters.\n\nNow, I need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nSince I start at 0, min H=9, but might be more.\n\nNow, dangerous turns: turn 4 and 5.\n\nI must not be on row 3 or 4 at turn 4 and turn 5.\n\nSo at turn 4, I should be on y=0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9 but y=9 is goal, might not be there yet.\n\nSimilarly turn 5.\n\nNow, I am at turn 2, y=0.\n\nI need to get to higher rows.\n\nPossible to go up fast or slow.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are always safe, I can be there anytime.\n\nBut I need to pass through the dangerous rows when it's safe.\n\nDangerous rows 3 and 4 are safe except at turn 4 and 5.\n\nSpecifically, row 3: safe except at turn 4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly row 4: safe except turn 4 and 5.\n\nAt other turns, I can be on row 3 or 4 safely.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, row 3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nAt turn 6, row 3 safe, etc.\n\nNow, I need to be at row 3 or 4 only when it's not turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut turn 4 and 5 are specific times.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI start at turn 2, y=0.\n\nI can choose to go up immediately or wait.\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nTurn 2: y=0, action U, y_{3}=1\n\nTurn 3: y=1, action U, y_{4}=2\n\nTurn 4: y=2, now at turn 4, I am on y=2, which is safe (freeway 2 safe at t_rel=2)\n\nNow, I need to go to y=3, but if I go U, y_{5}=3, but at turn 5, y=3, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf at turn 4 I stay, action S, then y_{5}=2, still on y=2 at turn 5, which is safe, but I need to go up later.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=2, I can go U to y_{6}=3\n\nTurn 6: y=3, now turn 6 is safe for row 3, as we saw.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 at turn 6 is also safe.\n\nSo let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn 2: y=0, action U → y3=1\n\nTurn 3: y=1, action U → y4=2\n\nTurn 4: y=2, action S → y5=2  (stay, so y5=2)\n\nTurn 5: y=2, action U → y6=3\n\nTurn 6: y=3, action U → y7=4\n\nTurn 7: y=4, action U → y8=5\n\nTurn 8: y=5, action U → y9=6\n\nTurn 9: y=6, action U → y10=7\n\nTurn 10: y=7, action U → y11=8\n\nTurn 11: y=8, action U → y12=9\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9, reached.\n\nBut I reached at turn 12, which is H=11 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 12, that's 11 actions? No.\n\nStart at turn 2, position y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y=9 at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=2, after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H with y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, total H actions.\n\nAt turn t1, I start, after action a_{t1}, I go to y_{t1+1}, and so on, until after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 2, if I take action, it affects y for turn 3.\n\nSo to have y_T=9 at turn T, I need the action at T-1 to be U if y_{T-1}=8, etc.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 2: action, set y3\n\nTurn 3: action, set y4\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: action, set y12=9\n\nSo after 10 actions, from turn 2 to turn 11, I set y12=9.\n\nH actions, from t= t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=2, actions at t=2,3,4,..., up to t=2+H-1, and y_{2+H} =9.\n\nSo H=10 in this case, y_{12}=9.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nIn the above, I wasted one turn staying at turn 4.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on row 3 or 4 at turn 4 and 5.\n\nIn the path above, at turn 4, I was on y=2, safe.\n\nAt turn 5, on y=2, safe.\n\nThen at turn 6, y=3, safe, etc.\n\nBut I could go faster to higher rows.\n\nFor example, after turn 4, if I go directly to y=5 or something.\n\nBut from y=2 at turn 4, I can only go to y=1,2,3 next.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t ±1 or 0.\n\nSo I can only change by one each turn.\n\nSo from y=2, I can go to y=3 at next turn.\n\nBut at turn 5, if I go to y=3, it is dangerous.\n\nSo I have to stay or go down.\n\nGo down to y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at turn 5.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are always safe, I can go to them earlier.\n\nBut I start from low.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, instead of going up immediately, I stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but staying might not help.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: y=0, action S → y3=0 (stay at y=0)\n\nThen turn 3: y=0, action U → y4=1\n\nTurn 4: y=1, action U → y5=2\n\nTurn 5: y=2, action U → y6=3\n\nNow turn 6: y=3, which is safe, since turn 6 is after the danger.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut let's see when I reach y=9.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 2: S, y3=0\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=1\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=2\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=3\n\nTurn 6: U, y7=4\n\nTurn 7: U, y8=5\n\nTurn 8: U, y9=6\n\nTurn 9: U, y10=7\n\nTurn 10: U, y11=8\n\nTurn 11: U, y12=9\n\nSame as before, 10 actions, reach at turn 12.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had:\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=2\n\nTurn 4: S, y5=2\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=3\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11: U, y12=9\n\nIn this case, from turn 5 to turn 11: y6=3 to y12=9, that's 6 steps to go from 3 to 9, which is 6 changes, so 6 actions: U each time to go up 6 steps.\n\ny6=3, after actions at turn 6 to 11: 6 actions to set y7 to y12.\n\ny6=3, action at turn 6 sets y7=4, ..., action at turn 11 sets y12=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence where I stayed at turn 2, I had y3=0, then later.\n\nBut both take 10 actions.\n\nCan I reach in 9 actions?\n\nMinimal is 9, if I go up each turn without delay.\n\nBut in that case:\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=2\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=3  -- but at turn 5, y=3, which is turn 5, t_rel=3, freeway 3 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt turn 4, if I go to y=2 to y=3, but turn 4 is dangerous for row 3? Turn 4 is t_rel=2, row 3 dangerous.\n\nAt turn 4, if I am on row 3, collision.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nTurn 4: if y4=2, and I do U, then y5=3, but at turn 4, I am at y=2, which is row 2, safe, but at turn 5, I will be at y=3, which is dangerous.\n\nBut the collision is at the turn when I am on the row.\n\nSo at turn 5, when I am on y=3, it is dangerous.\n\nTo avoid, I cannot be on row 3 at turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on row 4 at turn 5.\n\nIn the direct up, at turn 5, I would be on y=3 if I go up fast.\n\nBut I can be on a different row.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, instead of going to y=3, I go down or stay, but I was at y=2.\n\nIf at turn 4, I go down to y=1, action D, then y5=1.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=2\n\nTurn 4: D, y5=1  (go down to y=1)\n\nTurn 5: y=1, action U, y6=2\n\nTurn 6: y=2, U, y7=3\n\nTurn 7: y=3, U, y8=4\n\n...\n\nUp to y12=9, same as before or worse.\n\ny7=3 at turn 7, which is safe, then to y12=9, need 5 more ups, so from turn 5 to turn 11: y6=2? Let's list:\n\nAfter turn 4 D: y5=1\n\nTurn 5: y=1, U → y6=2\n\nTurn 6: y=2, U → y7=3\n\nTurn 7: y=3, U → y8=4\n\nTurn 8: y=4, U → y9=5\n\nTurn 9: y=5, U → y10=6\n\nTurn 10: y=6, U → y11=7\n\nTurn 11: y=7, U → y12=8\n\nTurn 12: y=8, U → y13=9\n\nThen action at turn 12 sets y13=9, so H=11 actions? Actions from turn 2 to 12, 11 actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay than go down.\n\nIn the first plan, with one stay, I reach in 10 actions.\n\nBut can I reach in 9?\n\nTo reach in 9 actions, I need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps, so must go up every turn, no down or stay.\n\nBut then y at each turn:\n\nTurn 2: y=0\n\nAfter action U, y3=1\n\nAfter U at turn 3, y4=2\n\nAfter U at turn 4, y5=3\n\nBut at turn 5, y=3, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I could skip row 3 at turn 5, but I can't, because I move one step at a time.\n\nUnless I am not on row 3 at turn 5.\n\nBut in this sequence, I must be at y=3 at turn 5 if I start from 0 and go up each turn.\n\nTurn 2: y=0\n\nTurn 3: y=1\n\nTurn 4: y=2\n\nTurn 5: y=3\n\nTurn 6: y=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11: y=9? After 9 actions: actions at turn 2 to 10.\n\nAction at turn 2: set y3\n\nAt turn 10: set y11\n\ny11=9 if I go up each time.\n\nBut at turn 5, y=3, collision.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 5, y=3, which is freeway 3, and at that turn, collision.\n\nSo impossible to go directly in 9 turns without being on row 3 or 4 at turn 4 or 5.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nAt turn 4: y=2\n\nAt turn 5: y=3\n\nTurn 4 is not dangerous for row 2, only row 3 and 4.\n\nAt turn 5, y=3 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on row 4 at turn 4, also dangerous.\n\nBut in direct up, I am on row 3 at turn 5.\n\nNow, to avoid, I need to be on a different row at turn 5.\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 2 or row 5 at turn 5.\n\nBut from start, if I go up slower.\n\nSuppose at turn 2, I stay: action S, y3=0\n\nThen turn 3: U, y4=1\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=2\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=3  -- at turn 6, y=3, but turn 6 is safe, no problem.\n\nThen continue: U, y7=4, etc.\n\nBut at turn 5: y=2, safe.\n\ny6=3 at turn 6, safe.\n\nThen to reach y=9: y6=3, then y7=4, y8=5, ..., y11=8, y12=9, so action at turn 11 sets y12=9, H=10 actions (turns 2 to 11).\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I start by going up faster, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are safe, go to them quickly, but I have to pass through 1-4.\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 5 at turn 5 or something.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=5 in 3 steps? From turn 2 to turn 5.\n\nAt turn 2: y=0\n\nAction U, y3=1\n\nAction U, y4=2\n\nAction U, y5=3 -- but at turn 5, y=3, dangerous if I go to y=3.\n\ny5=3 at turn 5.\n\nIf I do nothing different, I am stuck at y=3 at turn 5.\n\nBut at turn 4, I am at y=2.\n\nIf at turn 4, I go up to y=3, but at turn 4, if I go to y=3, then at turn 4, y=3, which is also dangerous because turn 4 row 3 has collision.\n\nIn the direct up:\n\nAt turn 4: y=2, if I do U, y5=3, but at turn 4, I am on y=2, not on row 3.\n\nThe collision is only when I am on the row at that turn.\n\nAt turn 4, if I am on y=2, row 2, which is safe at turn 4.\n\nThen after action U, at turn 5, I am on y=3, row 3, which is dangerous at turn 5.\n\nSo the problem is at turn 5, being on row 3.\n\nTo avoid, at turn 5, I should not be on row 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly at turn 4, not on row 3 or 4.\n\nBut at turn 4, if I am on row 2, it's ok.\n\nNow, for turn 5, I need to be on row <=2 or >=5.\n\nBut from row 2, at turn 4, I can only go to row 1,2,3 at turn 5.\n\nSo at turn 5, I can be at y=1,2,3.\n\ny=3 is dangerous, so I must be at y=1 or 2 at turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, if I were higher, but I am not.\n\nSo from row 2 at turn 4, I can choose to go to y=1,2, or 3 at turn 5.\n\nBut y=3 dangerous, so only y=1 or 2.\n\nThen at turn 5, I am on y=1 or 2, safe.\n\nThen later I go up.\n\nBut from y=1 or 2 at turn 5, I need to reach y=9, which takes at least 7 or 8 more actions, so total more than 9.\n\nFor example, y=2 at turn 5, then to y=9, need 7 steps up, so actions from turn 5 to turn 11, 7 actions, but turn 5 action sets y6, so to set y12=9, need actions up to turn 11, so from turn 2 to 11, 10 actions if I start from turn 2 with up.\n\nBut in the first plan, I was at y=2 at turn 5, and reached y=9 at turn 12 with 10 actions.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at turn 5, worse.\n\nSo minimal seems 10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence with stay, I used 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a higher row earlier by not going up immediately.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, stay, but that delays.\n\nOr, another thought: since I need to avoid row 3 and 4 at turn 4 and 5, I can be on row 4 before turn 4 or after turn 5.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, if I can be on row 3.\n\nTurn 3: y=?\n\nAt turn 2, I start y=0.\n\nIf I go U, y3=1\n\nAt turn 3, y=1, I can go U to y4=2\n\nOr if I go U again to y4=3? But from y=1, U to y=2.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t +1 max.\n\nSo at turn 3, y=1, action U, y4=2\n\nCannot go directly to 3.\n\nSo at turn 3, I can be at y=1 if I went up at turn 2.\n\nIf I stayed at turn 2, y3=0, then at turn 3, I can go to y=1.\n\nStill low.\n\nSo earliest to be on row 3 is at turn 4, if I go up twice: turn 2 U to y3=1, turn 3 U to y4=2, then turn 4 U to y5=3, but y5=3 at turn 5, dangerous.\n\nIf at turn 4 I go to y=3, but at turn 4, if y=3, then at turn 4, row 3 dangerous.\n\nSuppose at turn 4, I am on y=3.\n\nAt turn 4, t_rel=2, row 3 collision, so if I am on y=3 at turn 4, I collide immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=4 at turn 4, collide.\n\nSo I must not be on row 3 or 4 at turn 4, and not on row 3 or 4 at turn 5.\n\nIn the sequence where I go to y=2 at turn 4, and stay there at turn 4, so at turn 4 y=2 safe, then at turn 5 I stay or go down or up to y=3 but y=3 dangerous, so I stay at y=2 or go down to y=1.\n\nThen at turn 5 y=1 or 2, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to minimize, staying at y=2 is better.\n\nThen at turn 6, go to y=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=4 at turn 6 or 7.\n\nBut from y=2 at turn 5, action U to y6=3\n\nThen at turn 6, y=3, safe, then U to y7=4, etc.\n\nAs in first plan.\n\nNow, can I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on a higher row at turn 5.\n\nBut from start, at turn 5, the highest I can be is y=3, but dangerous, or y=2 if I go slower.\n\ny=2 at turn 5.\n\nThen from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so reach at turn 12 with y12=9.\n\nActions from turn 2 to 11.\n\nIf I can be on y=4 at turn 6, for example.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 6, y=3 if I go up from y=2 at turn 5.\n\nThen y7=4, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 5 directly after the danger.\n\nBut I think 10 is minimal.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 5-8 are always safe, I can go there and stay, but I need to pass through 3 and 4 safely.\n\nFor example, if I reach row 5 at turn 6.\n\nFrom y=0 at turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=2\n\nNow at turn 4, y=2, instead of staying, I go U to y5=3, but y5=3 at turn 5 dangerous? No, if I go U at turn 4, y5=3, so at turn 5, y=3.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at turn 4, I go to y=3, at turn 4, if y=3, turn 4 row 3 collision, so I cannot be on row 3 at turn 4.\n\nSo at turn 4, I must not be on row 3 or 4.\n\nSo on row 1,2,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at turn 4, I am at y=2, which is row 2, safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, I can only choose to go to y=1,2,3 for turn 5.\n\nBut y=3 dangerous at turn 5, so only y=1 or 2.\n\nSay y=2.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen turn 5, I can go U to y6=3\n\nTurn 6: y=3, safe (turn 6 is t_rel=4, safe for row 3)\n\nThen U to y7=4\n\nTurn 7: y=4, safe\n\nThen U to y8=5, etc.\n\nTo y12=9.\n\nSame.\n\nAt turn 5, after being at y=2, I could go up to y=3 at turn 6, same.\n\nNow, perhaps I can go faster after that.\n\nBut from y=2 at turn 5 to y=9, need to go up 7 times, so 7 actions to set y6 to y12, actions from turn 5 to 11, with y12=9.\n\nActions: turn 5 sets y6, turn 6 sets y7, ..., turn 11 sets y12.\n\nSo 7 actions from turn 5 to 11.\n\nBut I have actions from turn 2 to 4 as well.\n\nTurn 2,3,4: 3 actions to get to y=2 at turn 5? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 2: start y=0, action U, y3=1\n\nTurn 3: action U, y4=2\n\nTurn 4: action S, y5=2  (stay, so y5=2)\n\nThen turn 5: action U, y6=3\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11: action U, y12=9\n\nActions: turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 → 10 actions.\n\nIf at turn 4 I do something else.\n\nI think 10 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on row 4 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, can I be on row 3?\n\nAt turn 2: y=0, U, y3=1\n\nAt turn 3: y=1, U, y4=2\n\nCannot be on row 3 at turn 3.\n\nIf I stay at turn 2, y3=0, then turn 3 U, y4=1, still not row 3.\n\nSo row 3 can only be reached at turn 4 at earliest, but at turn 4 it is dangerous, so I have to be on row 3 at turn 6 or later.\n\nSimilarly row 4.\n\nSo the critical point is to delay reaching row 3 and 4 until after turn 5.\n\nTurn 6 is safe.\n\nSo in the first plan, I reach row 3 at turn 6.\n\nThen row 4 at turn 7, and so on.\n\nNow, for the actions, in the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: U (to y3=1)\n\nTurn 3: U (to y4=2)\n\nTurn 4: S (stay, y5=2)  // to avoid going to y=3 at turn 5\n\nTurn 5: U (to y6=3)\n\nTurn 6: U (to y7=4)\n\nTurn 7: U (to y8=5)\n\nTurn 8: U (to y9=6)\n\nTurn 9: U (to y10=7)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y11=8)\n\nTurn 11: U (to y12=9)\n\nNow, at turn 12, y=9, reached.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut in the action sequence, it should be for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=2, actions at 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nIn the answer, it should list actions for each turn.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 4, I stayed, but is that necessary? In this case, I stayed at y=2 from turn 4 to turn 5.\n\nBut at turn 4, y=2, I could go down, but that would be worse.\n\nI could go up later, but I think it's fine.\n\nNow, but in this sequence, I used turn 4 to stay.\n\nBut since I need to avoid being on row 3 at turn 5, by staying at turn 4, I remain at y=2 for turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nThen I go up.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 4, but I don't go to row 4 until turn 7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 5 faster, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are safe, and I can be on them anytime, but I have to go through 1-4.\n\nFor example, if at turn 3, I am at y=1, I could go up to y=2 at turn 4, same as before.\n\nI think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the number of turns: from start turn 2 to reach turn 12, 10 turns later? From turn 2 to turn 12 is 10 turns? Turn 2 to turn 12 is 11 turns, but positions.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 2\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 3, y set\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 2+k.\n\nSet y_{2+k}.\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nWith H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=10, y_{12}=9.\n\nCan I have y_{11}=9?\n\ny_{11}=9, so after H actions, with 2+H=11, so H=9.\n\nIs it possible with 9 actions?\n\nThen y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, y at each turn:\n\nTurn 2: y=0\n\nTurn 3: y=a\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: y=9\n\nSince I start from y=0 at turn 2, and end y=9 at turn 11, and must go up 9 times, so all actions must be U, no S or D.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 2: y=0\n\nTurn 3: y=1 (after U)\n\nTurn 4: y=2 (after U)\n\nTurn 5: y=3 (after U)\n\nBut at turn 5, y=3, collision.\n\nIf at some point I go down, but then I need to go up more, so y at turn 11 might be less, not 9.\n\nFor example, if I go down once, I need to go up an extra time, so H>9.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay once, I need H=10.\n\nSo impossible with H=9.\n\nTherefore minimal H=10.\n\nAnd the sequence as above.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, I didn't use it, but in the sequence I go through row 4 at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 7, t_rel=5? Turn 7 is T=7, t1=2, t_rel=5.\n\nFreeway 4 at t_rel=5: span of cars.\n\nFor example, third car: [-23 +6*5, -12+6*5] = [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18], no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nFor turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  // stay\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 11 U, y12=9.\n\nBut turn 11 action sets y12=9.\n\nNow, the actions are from turn 2 to turn 11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1\n\nt_1=2, H=10, so up to turn 2+9=11.\n\nActions: for turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 7: U to y8=5, which is row 5, always safe, etc.\n\nBut in the list, turn 10: U to y11=8, turn 11: U to y12=9.\n\nNow, but in the action at turn 4, I have S, which is stay.\n\nIs there a way without stay? For example, if I go down briefly, but that would require more actions.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 4 at a different time, but I think not necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at turn 4, I go down to y=1 instead of stay.\n\nBut then at turn 5, y=1, then I need to go up to y=2, etc., takes more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the sequence with one stay is fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 and 2 have cars, but after t_rel=0, they are safe.\n\nIn my path, I was on row 1 at turn 3, row 2 at turn 4 and 5? At turn 4 y=2, turn 5 y=2, so row 2 at turn 4 and 5.\n\nAt turn 4, t_rel=2, row 2: freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at t_rel=2: car span [-24-36*2, 11-36*2] = [-24-72, 11-72] = [-96,-61], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly at turn 5, t_rel=3, span [-24-108, 11-108] = [-132,-97], not 0, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with the sequence above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be the actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn terms of t_1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nt_1 + 9 = 2+9=11.\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on a freeway row \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Dangerous Turns\n- **Freeways 1 and 2**: Each has one left-moving car with initial span \\([-24, 11]\\) at turn 2 (relative turn \\(\\tau = 0\\)), speed 36.  \n  - Collision occurs only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 2), as at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 3), the span is \\([-60, -25]\\), excluding 0.  \n- **Freeways 3 and 4**: Each has three right-moving cars:  \n  - Car 1: Span \\([49, 60]\\) at turn 2, speed 6; never covers 0.  \n  - Car 2: Span \\([13, 24]\\) at turn 2, speed 6; never covers 0.  \n  - Car 3: Span \\([-23, -12]\\) at turn 2, speed 6; covers 0 at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 4) and \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 5).  \n  Thus, freeways 3 and 4 have collisions at turns 4 and 5.  \n- **Freeways 5 to 8**: Each has one right-moving car with span \\([49, 60]\\) at turn 2, speed 6; always positive, never covers 0.  \n\nDangerous turns for freeways:  \n- Turn 4 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)): Freeways 3 and 4 are dangerous (collision if player on row 3 or 4).  \n- Turn 5 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)): Freeways 3 and 4 are dangerous (collision if player on row 3 or 4).  \n\nTo avoid collision, the player must not be on row 3 or 4 at turns 4 and 5. Rows 5-8 are always safe, and rows 0 and 9 are safe (no freeways). The minimum \\(H\\) to reach row 9 from row 0 is 9 turns if moving up continuously, but this forces the player to be on row 3 at turn 5 (collision). Thus, a delay is necessary, and \\(H = 10\\) is the minimum.\n\n### Optimal Path and Actions\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H = 10\\) by:  \n- Moving up to row 2 by turn 4.  \n- Staying on row 2 at turn 4 to avoid moving to row 3 at turn 5 (which would cause collision).  \n- Moving up continuously from turn 5 onwards, reaching row 9 at turn 12.  \n\nActions (each action \\(a_t\\) determines \\(y_{t+1}\\)):  \n- Turn 2: \\(U\\) → \\(y_3 = 1\\) (safe, row 0 at turn 2 has no freeway).  \n- Turn 3: \\(U\\) → \\(y_4 = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 at turn 3: span \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not covered).  \n- Turn 4: \\(S\\) → \\(y_5 = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 at turn 4: span \\([-96, -61]\\), 0 not covered; avoids moving to row 3 at turn 5).  \n- Turn 5: \\(U\\) → \\(y_6 = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 at turn 5: row 3 dangerous at turn 5, but turn 6 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)) has span for third car \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not covered).  \n- Turn 6: \\(U\\) → \\(y_7 = 4\\) (safe, freeway 4 at turn 6: third car span \\([7, 18]\\), 0 not covered).  \n- Turn 7: \\(U\\) → \\(y_8 = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5 always safe).  \n- Turn 8: \\(U\\) → \\(y_9 = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 always safe).  \n- Turn 9: \\(U\\) → \\(y_{10} = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 always safe).  \n- Turn 10: \\(U\\) → \\(y_{11} = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 always safe).  \n- Turn 11: \\(U\\) → \\(y_{12} = 9\\) (reached goal at turn 12).  \n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 10\\) actions (turns 2 to 11) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4:  S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11:  U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) at turn 3 to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving to a new freeway, at turn T, you're only on y_T, not y_{T+1}, so you only check for cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=3. For each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction \"left\" means moving left, so position decreases, \"right\" means moving right, position increases.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for turns starting from t=3 to some H where y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9. Since t_1=3, turns are t=3,4,5,... up to some turn where y=9.\n\nThe sequence should start from t=3, and H is the number of turns, so the actions are for t=3 to t=3+H-1, and at turn t=3+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn index starting from t=3.\n\nSo at turn 3: position y=1.\n\nWe want y to be 9 at some turn T, and minimize T - 3 + 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1. Since t_1=3, t=0 corresponds to a_{3}, t=1 to a_{4}, up to t=H-1 to a_{3+H-1}.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + H - 1, y should be 9.\n\nSo for example, if H=1, that would be turn 3, but at turn 3, y=1, not 9, so impossible. Minimum H must be at least 8, since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, which is 8 steps up, but we might not go directly up, or we might stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut we need to minimize H, so I need to find the shortest path avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each future turn based on their speeds and directions.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care about when 0 is in their span at integer turns.\n\nThe span is given as head and tail. For left-moving cars, head is the front, so if moving left, head decreases, tail decreases. Similarly for right.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so h > τ since it's moving right.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ and h, but in the table, for freeway 3, it has (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be larger if it's the front.\n\nLet me check the notation.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for direction, left or right.\n\nFor left-moving, head is decreasing, so at t_1, head h, tail τ, with h and τ, but since moving left, if head is front, then for left-moving, head > tail? Not necessarily, it depends on how it's defined.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nLook at freeway 3: it has cars like (-48, -59, right, 6), and direction right.\n\nIf direction right, and span is [τ, h] with τ = -59, h = -48, so h > τ, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48], which is from left to right, so as it moves right, positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, (30,19,right,6), but 30 > 19, so [19,30], moving right.\n\nAnd (-6,-17,right,6), -6 > -17, so [-17,-6], moving right.\n\nFor left-moving, like freeway 1: (-60,-25,left,36), so h=-60, τ=-25, and since left, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [-60, -25], I think.\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] with ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the initial state, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, and for right, [τ, h] with τ and h.\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s), so I need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFor left-moving, head and tail are such that span is [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the example, freeway 1: (-60,-25,left,36), so h=-60, τ=-25, since left, span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25], so head is leftmost? Usually head is front, but when moving left, front is smaller x.\n\nPerhaps it's better not to think head and tail, just the span endpoints.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the interval [min, max] at turn T.\n\nSo for a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: min = h - s(T-t_1), max = τ - s(T-t_1)\n\nSince for left, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nWith ΔT = T - t_1\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: min = τ + sΔT, max = h + sΔT\n\nAnd collision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 is between min and max inclusive.\n\nNow, player is on freeway y at turn T if after action, y_T = y, and we check for cars on row y.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T} is set, and we check collision on y_T for that turn.\n\nNow, current turn t_1=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nCars are on freeways 1 to 8, but not all have cars. Freeways 1 and 2 have left-moving cars, 3 to 8 have right-moving cars, but let's list all.\n\nFreeway k, cars:\n\nk=1: one car: (-60,-25,left,36) so at t=3, span [h,τ] = [-60,-25] for left-moving.\n\nIn notation, for left, Span(t) = [h - s(t-3), τ - s(t-3)] for t>3\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nt_1=3, so ΔT = t - 3.\n\nSet τ_rel = t - 3, so relative turn from now.\n\nAt relative turn τ = 0 (t=3), positions as given.\n\nFor freeway 1: car: left, s=36, h=-60, τ=-25? τ is tail, but in span it's part of the interval.\n\nFor left-moving at relative time τ (from t=3), min = h - s*τ = -60 - 36τ\n\nmax = τ - s*τ = -25 - 36τ? τ is time, confusing.\n\nUse k for time offset.\n\nSet k = t - t_1 = t - 3, so at k=0, t=3.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, left, s=36, head h=-60, tail τ=-25 (since left, span [h,τ] with h and τ)\n\nSo at time k, min_x = h - s*k = -60 - 36k\n\nmax_x = τ - s*k = -25 - 36k\n\nCollision on freeway 1 at time k if player on y=1 and 0 in [min_x, max_x], i.e., min_x <= 0 <= max_x.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: similar, (-60,-25,left,36), same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: multiple cars, all right-moving.\n\nCars: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, at k=0, span [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, so [ -59, -48 ]? τ=-59, h=-48, so min=τ=-59, max=h=-48\n\nAt time k, min = τ + s*k = -59 + 6k\n\nmax = h + s*k = -48 + 6k\n\nSimilarly, second car: (30,19,right,6), τ=19, h=30? Given as (head h, tail τ), but for right, head should be larger, so h=30, τ=19, so [τ,h] = [19,30]\n\nAt k=0, min=19, max=30\n\nAt time k, min = τ + s k = 19 + 6k\n\nmax = h + s k = 30 + 6k\n\nThird car: (-6,-17,right,6), h=-6, τ=-17, so [τ,h] = [-17,-6]\n\nmin = τ + s k = -17 + 6k\n\nmax = h + s k = -6 + 6k\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) same as k=3.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car: (-48,-59,right,6) so similar to first car of k=3.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8 has (-48,-59,right,6), same as others.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each time, I need to find when 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at k=0 (t=3).\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny can be from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there. But player is on freeway only when y between 1 and 8, I think. The grid has vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only if on y=1 to 8 and 0 in car span.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,y), so x=0 always, we care about when x=0 is in car span on that y.\n\nNow, to minimize time to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=1 to 9, difference of 8, minimum H=8 if we go up every turn, but we might have to avoid cars, so possibly longer.\n\nBut let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and time when it is occupied, meaning 0 is in some car's span.\n\nDefine for each y and k, whether (y,k) is occupied, i.e., if player on y at time k, collision occurs.\n\nFor y not in 1-8, always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow for y=1 to 8:\n\nStart with y=1: freeway 1, one car left, s=36, h=-60, τ=-25\n\nAt time k, min_x = -60 -36k\n\nmax_x = -25 -36k\n\n0 in [min_x, max_x] if min_x <= 0 <= max_x, so -60 -36k <= 0 and 0 <= -25 -36k? Let's solve.\n\nmin_x <= 0 <= max_x\n\nSo -60 -36k <= 0 and 0 <= -25 -36k\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36k <= 0 => -36k <= 60 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36k >= -60, but k integer >=0, 36k >= -60 always true for k>=0.\n\n-60 -36k <= 0 => -36k <= 60 => k >= -60/36? Since k>=0, always true? -36k <= 60, divide by -36, reverse: k >= -60/36 = -5/3, so k >= -1.666, since k>=0, always true.\n\nBut we also need 0 <= max_x = -25 -36k\n\n0 <= -25 -36k => 25 + 36k <= 0? 0 <= -25 -36k => 25 + 36k <= 0? No:\n\n0 <= -25 -36k => add 25 to both sides: 25 <= -36k? Then multiply both sides by -1, reverse: -25 >= 36k, so 36k <= -25\n\nBut k >=0, 36k >=0, -25 <0, so 36k <= -25 is impossible for k>=0.\n\nThus for y=1, 0 <= max_x is never true for k>=0, since max_x = -25 -36k <= -25 <0, so 0 <= negative number false.\n\nTherefore, for y=1, at all k, 0 not in span, so freeway 1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nmin_x = -60 -36k, for k=0, min=-60, max=-25, both negative, 0 not in [-60,-25].\n\nAs k increases, min and max decrease, more negative, so 0 never in interval. So indeed, for y=1, no car covers x=0 at any time. So freeway 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nBut at k=0, position is (0,1), and no collision, which makes sense.\n\nNow freeway 2: similar, same car as y=1, (-60,-25,left,36), same thing, min and max negative and decreasing, so 0 never covered. So y=2 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) but for right-moving, at k=0, [τ,h] = [-59,-48], min=-59, max=-48\n\nAt time k, min = τ + s k = -59 + 6k\n\nmax = h + s k = -48 + 6k\n\n0 in [min,max] if -59 +6k <= 0 <= -48 +6k\n\nWhich is -59 +6k <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +6k\n\nFirst: -59 +6k <=0 => 6k <=59 => k <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so k<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6k => 48 <= 6k => k >= 48/6 = 8\n\nSo for k=8,9\n\nSimilarly, second car: (30,19,right,6) at k=0, [τ,h]=[19,30], min=19, max=30\n\nAt k, min=19+6k, max=30+6k\n\n0 in [min,max] if 19+6k <=0 <=30+6k\n\nBut 19+6k <=0? 6k <= -19, k <= -19/6 ≈ -3.166, impossible for k>=0\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=30+6k always true, but min=19+6k >=19>0, so 0 < min <= max, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-6,-17,right,6) at k=0, [τ,h]=[-17,-6], min=-17, max=-6\n\nAt k, min= -17 +6k, max= -6 +6k\n\n0 in [min,max] if -17+6k <=0 <= -6+6k\n\nFirst: -17+6k <=0 => 6k <=17 => k<=17/6≈2.833, k<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6+6k => 6 <=6k => k>=1\n\nSo for k=1,2\n\nNow for freeway 3, occupied if any car covers 0.\n\nSo at k=1: third car min=-17+6= -11, max=-6+6=0? k=1, min=-17+6*1= -11, max=-6+6=0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 <= max=0, so 0 is included, so at k=1, 0 in span for third car.\n\nSimilarly at k=2: min=-17+12= -5, max=-6+12=6, so [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt k=1 and k=2, occupied by third car.\n\nAlso, first car at k=8 and k=9: min=-59+48= -11? k=8, min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nk=9: min=-59+54= -5, max=-48+54=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nk=8 and 9 for first car.\n\nSecond car never.\n\nSo for freeway 3, occupied at k=1,2 (by car3), and k=8,9 (by car1)\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? From table: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) same as y=3.\n\nSo identical to freeway 3, occupied at k=1,2,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSimilar to first car of y=3.\n\nAt k, min = τ + s k = -59 + 6k (since right, min=τ + s k)\n\nmax = h + s k = -48 + 6k\n\n0 in [min,max] if -59+6k <=0 <= -48+6k\n\nSo -59+6k <=0 => k <= 59/6≈9.833, k<=9\n\n0 <= -48+6k => k >= 48/6=8\n\nSo k=8,9\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same car, (-48,-59,right,6), so occupied at k=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied at k=8,9\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied at k=8,9\n\nNow, for y=1 and y=2, always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=3 and y=4 occupied at k=1,2 and k=8,9\n\ny=5,6,7,8 occupied only at k=8,9\n\nAt other times, free.\n\nNow, player at k=0, y=1, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nFreeways 1-8 correspond to y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nWe start at y=1, k=0.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to go up as much as possible, but avoid occupied cells.\n\nNow, occupied times:\n\nLet me list for each y, at which k it is occupied.\n\ny=1: never occupied\n\ny=2: never occupied (from earlier)\n\ny=3: occupied at k=1,2,8,9\n\ny=4: occupied at k=1,2,8,9\n\ny=5: occupied at k=8,9\n\ny=6: occupied at k=8,9\n\ny=7: occupied at k=8,9\n\ny=8: occupied at k=8,9\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nWe start at k=0, y=1.\n\nWe can go to y=9 in 8 steps if no obstacles, but there might be.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 are always safe, we can stay or move, but we need to go up.\n\nNow, the critical part is around k=1,2 and k=8,9 where some rows are occupied.\n\nSpecifically, at k=1 and 2, y=3 and y=4 are occupied, so we cannot be on y=3 or y=4 at k=1 or k=2.\n\nSimilarly, at k=8 and 9, y=3 to y=8 are occupied except possibly others, but y=3,4,5,6,7,8 all occupied at k=8,9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 occupied at k=8,9, and y=3,4 also occupied at k=8,9.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 not occupied at any k, including k=8,9? y=1 and y=2 are never occupied, as we saw.\n\nFor example, at k=8, y=1 is not occupied, since only y=3-8 occupied at k=8,9.\n\ny=1 and y=2 always safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nOne way is to go directly up from y=1.\n\nBut at k=1, if we go to y=2, that is safe.\n\nAt k=1, we take action, so at turn k, after action, we have y_k.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt k=0, we start, no action yet? Turn k=0 (t=3), position is given, we take action a_{t_1} = a_3.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} is set for next turn.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAt time t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision at turn t: when we are at position (0, y_t), and we check if on freeway y_t, if 0 in car span for that y at turn t.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at (0, y_T), and we check for cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the action: at turn T, we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it depends on y_T, not on the action.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need actions from t=3 onwards.\n\nAt t=3 (k=0), we are at y=1.\n\nWe take action a_3, which will set y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3.\n\nThen at t=4 (k=1), we are at y_4, and check collision on y_4 at turn 4 (k=1).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need y at some turn to be 9.\n\nMinimize the number of turns, so reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=1 to 9, minimum 8 actions to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\nStart at t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t=3+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=3 to t=3+H-1, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have moved H steps, but y can change by less.\n\nTo increase y by 8, from 1 to 9, we need at least 8 U actions, and no D, but S might be used to wait.\n\nBut with S, H increases, so to minimize H, we should avoid S and D, only U if possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on occupied (y,k).\n\nNow, occupied points:\n\nList for each k and y if occupied.\n\nk from 0 onwards.\n\ny=1: never occ\n\ny=2: never occ\n\ny=3: occ at k=1,2,8,9\n\ny=4: occ at k=1,2,8,9\n\ny=5: occ at k=8,9\n\ny=6: occ at k=8,9\n\ny=7: occ at k=8,9\n\ny=8: occ at k=8,9\n\ny=0: never occ\n\ny=9: never occ\n\nNow, at k=0, we are at y=1, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose we go directly up: each turn U.\n\nThen:\n\nAt k=0, t=3, y=1, safe.\n\nTake a_3 = U, so y_4 = 1 +1 =2\n\nAt k=1, t=4, y=2, which is safe (y=2 never occ)\n\nTake a_4 = U, y_5 = 2+1=3\n\nAt k=2, t=5, y=3, but at k=2, y=3 is occupied! Since occ at k=2.\n\nCollision.\n\nCannot be on y=3 at k=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=3 earlier.\n\nAt k=1, if we are on y=3, but at k=1, y=3 is occupied.\n\nIn the sequence above, at k=1, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nBut at k=2, we go to y=3, which is occupied at k=2.\n\nSo collision at turn t=5, k=2.\n\nThus, direct up not possible because at k=2, y=3 occ.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at k=1 and k=2.\n\nSimilarly, later at k=8,9, y=3 to 8 occ, but since we are going to y=9, we might not be there, or we can be on y=9 before.\n\nk=8,9 are later, we might reach y=9 before k=8.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=9 by k=7 or earlier.\n\nMinimum k to reach y=9: from y=1, need +8, so at least k=8 if we go up every turn.\n\nStart at k=0, y=1.\n\nAfter first U, at k=1, y=2\n\nAfter second U, at k=2, y=3\n\nBut y=3 occ at k=2.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn k=m, y position.\n\nAt turn k, y_k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, k=0, y=1\n\nAfter 1 action, k=1, y= y_1\n\nGenerally, after t actions from start, at turn k=t, y_{t_1 + t} or something.\n\nSet relative: at relative time k (from start, k=0,1,2,...), at turn t=3+k, position y_k.\n\nAt k=0, y_0 =1\n\nAfter action a_k (at turn t=3+k), it sets y_{k+1} for next turn.\n\nAction at time k (t=3+k) determines y_{k+1}.\n\nCollision at time k if on y_k and occupied.\n\nFor the state at time k, y_k.\n\nTo have y_k =9 for some k.\n\nWe want min k such that y_k=9.\n\ny_k depends on previous actions.\n\ny_0 =1\n\nWe apply actions a_0, a_1, ..., a_{m-1} to reach y_m =9 for some m.\n\nThen H = m, and we have m actions from k=0 to k=m-1.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn t=3+k for k=0 to m, with y_k.\n\ny_m=9 at turn t=3+m.\n\nThe actions are at t=3 to t=3+m-1, so H = number of actions = m.\n\nWe want min m such that we can have y_m=9 with no collision at any step j=0 to m.\n\nCollision at step j if at that turn, y_j occupied.\n\ny_j at time j.\n\nNow, to min m, we need to increase y as fast as possible, but avoid occupied points.\n\nOccupied points in (y,k) grid:\n\n- At k=1: y=3 and y=4 occupied\n\n- At k=2: y=3 and y=4 occupied\n\n- At k=8: y=3,4,5,6,7,8 occupied\n\n- At k=9: y=3,4,5,6,7,8 occupied\n\nOther (y,k) are free, for y=1-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always free.\n\nWe start at (y,k)=(1,0), free.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some k=m, with m min.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,1, so we move to (y',k+1)\n\nWe need a path from (1,0) to (9,m) for some m, with all points on path free, and y_{m}=9.\n\nSince we want min m, and y must increase by 8, m must be at least 8.\n\nIf we go only U, m=8, but let's see if possible.\n\nPath: start (1,0) free\n\nAfter a0, y1 = y0 + Δa0, at k=1, y1.\n\nIf a0=U, y1=2, at k=1, (2,1) free\n\nThen a1=U, y2=3, at k=2, (3,2) but occupied, not free.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf a0=S, y1=1, at k=1, (1,1) free? y=1 at k=1, is it occupied? y=1 never occ, so (1,1) free.\n\nThen a1=U, y2=2, at k=2, (2,2) free (y=2 never occ)\n\nThen a2=U, y3=3, at k=3, (3,3) is it free?\n\ny=3 occupied at k=1,2,8,9, not at k=3.\n\nk=3, not in {1,2,8,9}, so free.\n\nSimilarly, then we can continue.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nWe are at k=3, y=3, free.\n\nThen a3=U, y4=4, at k=4, (4,4): y=4 occ at k=1,2,8,9, not k=4, free.\n\na4=U, y5=5, at k=5, (5,5): y=5 occ only at k=8,9, not k=5, free.\n\na5=U, y6=6, at k=6, (6,6) free, since occ only k=8,9\n\na6=U, y7=7, at k=7, (7,7) free\n\na7=U, y8=8, at k=8, (8,8) but at k=8, y=8 occupied! Since y=8 occ at k=8.\n\nCollision at k=8.\n\nProblem at k=8.\n\nAt k=8, y=8 is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at k=7, then to y=8 at k=8, but y=8 occ at k=8.\n\nOr if we go to y=9 at k=8.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=7 at k=7, we need to go up twice, but at k=8, if we go to y=8, occ, or to y=9 directly? From y=7 to y=8 at k=8, y=8 occ.\n\nActions: at k=7, we are at y=7, take action a7.\n\nIf a7=U, y8=8, then at k=8, position y=8, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=7, at k=8, y=7 occupied? y=7 occ at k=8, yes, collision.\n\nIf a7=D, y8=6, at k=8, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nAt k=8, all y=3 to 8 occupied, so if we are on y=3 to 8 at k=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly at k=9.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be on y=0,1,2 or y=9 at k=8 and k=9.\n\ny=0,1,2 not occupied, y=9 not.\n\nBut we are going up, from below.\n\nIn the earlier path, we reached y=7 at k=7.\n\nAt k=7, y=7, free.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut at k=8, if we go to y=8, occ; to y=7 or y=6, occ; only if we go to y=9, but from y=7, we need two steps to y=9.\n\na7=U, y8=8, but at k=8, y=8 occ.\n\na7=S, y8=7, occ at k=8.\n\na7=D, y8=6, occ.\n\nAll lead to collision at k=8 if we are on y=3-8.\n\nThe only safe at k=8 and k=9 are y=0,1,2,9.\n\nSo from y=7 at k=7, we cannot move to a safe position at k=8 except possibly y=8,9 but y=8 occ, y=9 not reachable in one step.\n\ny from 7, actions: U to 8, D to 6, S to 7, all which at k=8 are on y=6,7,8 all occupied.\n\nNo way to avoid collision if we are on y=7 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach y=8 earlier, but y=8 at k<8 might be safe, but at k=8 it is occ.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 before k=8 or at k=8 but on y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 by k=7, for example.\n\nFrom start, min k to reach y=9.\n\ny_0=1\n\nTo have y_k=9 for k<8, but k min is 8, since +8 needed.\n\ny_k = y_0 + number of U minus number of D up to k.\n\nSince y0=1, yk <= 1 + k, so yk=9 only if k>=8.\n\nSimilarly, yk >=1 - k, but k>=0, not binding.\n\nSo min possible k for yk=9 is k=8, with all U actions.\n\nBut at k=8, if we are on y=9, it is safe, since no cars.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at k=8, we need to have taken 8 U actions in 8 steps, so y8=1+8=9.\n\nThen at k=8, y=9, safe.\n\nBut in the path, we need all intermediate points free.\n\nIn the direct up, we had problem at k=2 and at k=8, but at k=8 if we reach y=9, it is safe, but the issue is getting there without collision.\n\nFor example, if we can go from (1,0) to (9,8) with all U, but at k=2, (3,2) occ, and at k=8, if we are on y=8 it occ, but if on y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at k=8, we must be on y=8 at k=7, but y=8 at k=7 is free, since occ only k=8,9.\n\ny=8 occ at k=8,9, not at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, at k=7, y=7 free, etc.\n\nBut at k=2, (3,2) occ.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe can delay going up at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at k=0, y=1, take S or D to stay low.\n\nBut D to y=0, which is safe.\n\nLet's find a path.\n\nSince at k=1 and k=2, y=3 and 4 are dangerous, we should not be on y=3 or 4 at k=1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, at k=8 and 9, avoid y=3 to 8.\n\nBut since we want to reach y=9 early, we should go up as soon as possible except when occupied.\n\nNow, y=1 and 2 are always safe, so we can stay there.\n\nAt k=0: (1,0) free\n\nWe can take a0 = S, so y1=1, at k=1, (1,1) free (y=1 safe)\n\nThen at k=1, take a1 = S, y2=1, at k=2, (1,2) free\n\nThen at k=2, take a2 = U, y3=2, at k=3, (2,3) free\n\nThen a3 = U, y4=3, at k=4, (3,4) : y=3 at k=4, occ? k=4 not in {1,2,8,9}, so free.\n\nSimilarly, a4 = U, y5=4, at k=5, (4,5) free (k=5 not occ for y=4)\n\na5 = U, y6=5, at k=6, (5,6) free\n\na6 = U, y7=6, at k=7, (6,7) free\n\na7 = U, y8=7, at k=8, (7,8) but at k=8, y=7 occupied! Collision.\n\nStuck at k=8.\n\nFrom y=6 at k=7, if we go U to y=7 at k=8, occ.\n\nOr S to y=6 at k=8, occ.\n\nD to y=5 at k=8, occ.\n\nAll occupied at k=8.\n\nTo avoid k=8, we need to reach y=9 by k=7.\n\nBut k=7, y=9? y_7 <= 1 +7 =8, so y7 <=8, cannot be 9 at k=7.\n\nMax y at k=7 is 1+7=8 if all U.\n\ny7=8 possible.\n\nAt k=7, y=8, which is free, since occ only k=8,9.\n\nThen at k=7, we take action to go to y=9 at k=8.\n\nBut at k=8, if y=9, safe.\n\nBut to go from y=8 at k=7 to y=9 at k=8, take U.\n\nThen at k=8, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=8 at k=7.\n\nFrom start, min time to y=8.\n\ny0=1, after 7 U, y7=8.\n\nBut in the path, we need to avoid occupied points.\n\nSpecifically, at k=2, if we go to y=3, occ.\n\nSo we need to be not on y=3 at k=2.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=4 at k=2, etc.\n\nSo let's go directly but avoid k=2 for y=3.\n\nFor example:\n\nk=0: (1,0) free, take a0=U to y1=2\n\nk=1: (2,1) free, take a1=U? If U, y2=3 at k=2, occ. Bad.\n\nSo take a1=S, y2=2 at k=2, (2,2) free\n\nThen a2=U, y3=3 at k=3, (3,3) free (k=3 not occ)\n\nThen a3=U, y4=4 at k=4, (4,4) free\n\na4=U, y5=5 at k=5, (5,5) free\n\na5=U, y6=6 at k=6, (6,6) free\n\na6=U, y7=7 at k=7, (7,7) free\n\na7=U, y8=8 at k=8, (8,8) but occ at k=8, collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nFrom y=7 at k=7, take U to y8=8, but occ.\n\nBut we need to be at y=8 at k=7 to go to y=9 at k=8.\n\nAt k=7, y=7, we can take U to y=8 at k=8, but y=8 occ at k=8.\n\nPerhaps go to y=9 from y=8 at k=7, but y=8 at k=7 is free, but to be at y=9 at k=8, we need to take action at k=7 to set y8.\n\nIf at k=7, y=8, take U, y8=9, then at k=8, y=9, safe.\n\nBut how to have y=8 at k=7.\n\nIn the path above, we can reach y=7 at k=7.\n\ny=7 at k=7 is free, but to have y=8 at k=7, we need to be at y=8 at k=7.\n\nFrom y=7 at k=7, we are at (7,7), we take action to go to y8.\n\nBut y at k=7 is 7, so to have y=8 at k=7, it's the position at that turn, so we can only change for next turn.\n\nAt turn k=7, position is y=7, after action, y8 is set.\n\nSo at k=7, we are at y=7.\n\nWe cannot be at y=8 at k=7 unless we were there before.\n\nTo have y=8 at k=7, we must have taken actions to reach y=8 at turn 7.\n\nFor example, if we go faster earlier.\n\nBut from y=1, min k to y=8 is k=7 with all U, but at k=2, (3,2) occ, so we cannot take all U.\n\nIf we take some U earlier, but we delayed at k=1 and k=2.\n\nIn the first alternative, we had at k=2, y=2, then k=3 y=3, etc., so at k=7, y=7.\n\nBut y=7 at k=7, which is free.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need two more steps: to y=8 at k=8 and y=9 at k=9.\n\nBut at k=8, if we go to y=8, occ; if we stay or down, occ.\n\nAnd at k=9, y=8 occ or if we go to y=9, but from y=7 at k=7, we can go to y=8 at k=8, but occ, or to y=6 at k=8, occ, etc.\n\nThen at k=8, take action to go to y=9 at k=9.\n\nBut at k=9, if y=9, safe, but k=9 is later.\n\nH would be larger.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at k=7, take U at k=7, to y8=8 at k=8, but collision at k=8.\n\nTake S, y8=7 at k=8, collision.\n\nTake D, y8=6 at k=8, collision.\n\nAll collision at k=8.\n\nThen we must be on safe row at k=8, like y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut from y=7 at k=7, we can only go to y=6,7,8 at k=8, all occupied.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=6 at k=7, same thing.\n\nLet's list possible positions at k=7.\n\ny=7 at k=7 free, but from there, no safe action for k=8.\n\ny=6 at k=7 free, same.\n\ny=5 at k=7 free, to y=4,5,6 at k=8, but y=4,5,6 all occupied at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at k=7 free, to y=3,4,5 at k=8 occ.\n\ny=3 at k=7 free, to y=2,3,4 at k=8: y=2 is safe, y=3 and 4 occ.\n\nSo if at k=7, we are on y=3, we can take D to y=2 at k=8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=2 at k=7, we can take S or U or D, but y=1,2,3 at k=8: y=1 and 2 safe, y=3 occ.\n\nSo we can go to y=2 or y=1 at k=8 safe.\n\nIf on y=1 at k=7, to y=0,1,2 all safe.\n\nBut we are coming from below, so at k=7, we might be on low y.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be high at some point.\n\nSince at k=8 and 9, only low or high y safe, we can go to y=2 at k=8, for example, then later go up.\n\nBut that will take more time.\n\nFor min time, we can reach y=9 at k=9 or later.\n\nFor example, at k=7, be on y=3, take D to y=2 at k=8.\n\nAt k=8, (2,8) free (y=2 always safe)\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=2 to y=9, need 7 U, so from k=8, after 7 actions, at k=15, y=9.\n\nH=15, large.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt k=7, be on y=2 or something.\n\nBut we can be higher at k=7.\n\nMax y at k=7 is 8, but we can't reach it because of early occupation.\n\nFrom start, with all U except avoid k=2 for y=3.\n\nSo at k=0: (1,0) take U to y1=2 at k=1\n\nk=1: (2,1) take S to y2=2 at k=2 (avoid going to y=3)\n\nk=2: (2,2) take U to y3=3 at k=3, (3,3) free\n\nThen U to y4=4 at k=4, (4,4) free\n\nU to y5=5 at k=5, (5,5) free\n\nU to y6=6 at k=6, (6,6) free\n\nU to y7=7 at k=7, (7,7) free\n\nNow at k=7, y=7, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut at k=8, we cannot be on y=7,8,etc.\n\nSo we must move to a safe row at k=8.\n\nFrom y=7, we can go down to y=6, but occ at k=8, or to y=8 occ, only options are y=6,7,8 all occ.\n\nNo, we can go to y=7,8,6, all occ at k=8.\n\nBut y=2 is safe, but from y=7, we can't reach y=2 in one step.\n\nActions only change by 1.\n\nSo from y=7 at k=7, possible next y at k=8 are 6,7,8 all occupied.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=7 at k=7, because it leads to inevitable collision at k=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=6 at k=7, to y=5,6,7 at k=8, all occ.\n\ny=5 at k=7 to y=4,5,6 at k=8 occ.\n\ny=4 at k=7 to y=3,4,5 at k=8 occ.\n\ny=3 at k=7 to y=2,3,4 at k=8: y=2 is safe, y=3 and 4 occ.\n\nSo if at k=7, we are on y=3, we can take D to go to y=2 at k=8, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=2 at k=7, we can take S to y=2 at k=8, safe, or U to y=3 at k=8, but y=3 occ at k=8, collision, so only S or D to y=1 or y=2.\n\nD to y=1 at k=8, safe.\n\nBut y=1 or 2 at k=8.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut it will take time.\n\nTo minimize, we need to be as high as possible at k=7.\n\nThe highest safe at k=7 is y=3, since from there we can go down to y=2 at k=8 safe.\n\ny=4 at k=7 is also free, but from y=4, at k=8, we can go to y=3,4,5 all occ, no safe, so we cannot be on y=4 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 at k=7, from there no safe action for k=8.\n\nOnly y=3 at k=7 allows to go to y=2 at k=8.\n\ny=2 at k=7 allows to go to y=1 or 2 at k=8.\n\ny=1 at k=7 to y=0,1,2 all safe.\n\nBut for min time, we want to be high at k=7, so y=3 is better than lower.\n\ny=3 at k=7 free.\n\nHow to reach y=3 at k=7.\n\nFrom start, y0=1\n\nWe can go up, but avoid being on y=3 or 4 at k=1 and k=2.\n\nAt k=1 and k=2, we should not be on y=3 or 4.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are safe at all k.\n\nSo possible path:\n\nk=0: (1,0) take U, to y1=2 at k=1\n\nk=1: (2,1) take S, to y2=2 at k=2 (stay at y=2 to avoid)\n\nk=2: (2,2) take U, to y3=3 at k=3\n\nBut we need to be at k=7 y=3.\n\nAt k=3, y=3.\n\nThen from k=3 to k=7, we can go up to higher.\n\nBut at k=7, we want y=3, so we need to stay or go down.\n\nTo reach y=3 at k=7.\n\ny at k=3 is 3, then we need to keep y=3 for 4 turns or something.\n\nBut let's plan the path to be at y=3 at k=7.\n\nStart:\n\nk=0: (1,0) take S, to y1=1 at k=1\n\nk=1: (1,1) take S, to y2=1 at k=2\n\nk=2: (1,2) take U, to y3=2 at k=3\n\nk=3: (2,3) take U, to y4=3 at k=4\n\nBut at k=4, y=3, but we want y=3 at k=7, so we are at y=3 at k=4.\n\nThen we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to be at y=3 at k=7.\n\nFrom k=4 to k=7, 3 turns.\n\nIf we stay at y=3, take S at k=4, y5=3 at k=5\n\nS at k=5, y6=3 at k=6\n\nS at k=6, y7=3 at k=7\n\nThen at k=7, y=3, free.\n\nThen at k=7, take D, to y8=2 at k=8\n\nAt k=8, (2,8) free, since y=2 always safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=2 to y=9, need 7 U actions.\n\nFrom k=8, take U to y9=3 at k=9\n\nAt k=9, (3,9) but y=3 occ at k=9! Collision.\n\nAt k=9, y=3 occupied.\n\nIf we go U from y=2 at k=8 to y=3 at k=9, occ.\n\nTake S, stay y=2 at k=9, safe, but not progress.\n\nOr D to y=1 at k=9, safe.\n\nBut to go up, we need to go through y=3, but at k=9, y=3 occ.\n\nAt k=9, y=3,4,5,6,7,8 all occupied.\n\nSo from y=2 at k=8, we can only stay or go down to y=1 or up to y=3 but occ at k=9.\n\nSo we can stay at y=2 or go to y=1, then later when safe go up.\n\nBut the next safe time for y=3 is after k=9.\n\ny=3 occupied at k=1,2,8,9, so at k=10, it might be free.\n\nAt k=10, y=3: min and max for cars.\n\nFor y=3, cars at k=10.\n\nFirst car: for right-moving, min = -59 +6*10 = -59+60=1, max= -48+60=12, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car min=19+60=79, max=30+60=90, not.\n\nThird car min= -17+60=43, max= -6+60=54, not.\n\nSo at k=10, y=3 free.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut at k=10, we can be on y=3.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nFor min H, we can reach y=9 at k=8 by being on y=8 at k=7 and U to y=9 at k=8.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at k=7, we need to avoid the early occupation.\n\nAt k=2, we cannot be on y=3, so we must be on y<=2 at k=2.\n\nFrom y=1 at k=0, to y=2 at k=1, then at k=1, if we take U, y2=3 at k=2 occ, bad.\n\nSo take S or D at k=1 to stay at y=2 or go to y=1.\n\nThen at k=2, we are on y=1 or 2.\n\nThen from there, we can go up, but it takes time to reach high y.\n\nFor example:\n\nk=0: (1,0) U to y1=2 at k=1\n\nk=1: (2,1) S to y2=2 at k=2\n\nk=2: (2,2) U to y3=3 at k=3\n\nk=3: (3,3) U to y4=4 at k=4\n\nk=4: (4,4) U to y5=5 at k=5\n\nk=5: (5,5) U to y6=6 at k=6\n\nk=6: (6,6) U to y7=7 at k=7\n\nAt k=7, y=7, free.\n\nBut from here, we cannot go to a safe position at k=8 except if we could go to y=9, but can't.\n\nSo we must be lower at k=7.\n\nBe at y=3 at k=7.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom start, go slower.\n\nk=0: (1,0) S to y1=1 at k=1\n\nk=1: (1,1) S to y2=1 at k=2\n\nk=2: (1,2) U to y3=2 at k=3\n\nk3: (2,3) U to y4=3 at k=4\n\nk4: (3,4) S to y5=3 at k=5\n\nk5: (3,5) S to y6=3 at k6\n\nk6: (3,6) S to y7=3 at k7\n\nAt k=7, y=3, free.\n\nThen at k=7, take D to y8=2 at k=8\n\nAt k=8, (2,8) free\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at k=8, take U to y9=3 at k=9\n\nBut at k=9, (3,9) occupied, collision.\n\nTake S to y9=2 at k=9, safe, but not progress.\n\nOr D to y9=1 at k=9, safe.\n\nThen at k=9, on y=1 or 2.\n\nThen at k=10, we can go to y=3, since at k=10, y=3 free, as I thought earlier.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt k=8: (2,8) take S, to y9=2 at k=9\n\nAt k=9, (2,9) free (y=2 safe)\n\nThen at k=9, take U to y10=3 at k=10\n\nAt k=10, (3,10) free (since y=3 occ only k=1,2,8,9, not k=10)\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nTo minimize, we can go faster after k=2.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 to waste time, but that might not help.\n\nOr, since at k=1 and k=2, y=3 and 4 are occupied, but y=1 and 2 are safe, we can stay there, then after k=2, go up fast.\n\nBut at k=8,9 we have problem.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before k=8, but impossible.\n\nk=8 is the earliest possible for y=9.\n\nSo we must be on y=8 at k=7 and take U to y9 at k=8.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at k=7, we need to have taken 7 U actions in 7 steps from k=0 to k=7.\n\nBut at k=2, if we are on y=3, it is occupied, so we cannot be on y=3 at k=2.\n\nWith all U, at k=2, y=3.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=8 at k=7, because to do that, we must be on y=3 at k=2, which is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at k=7, we must be on y=3 at k=2 or later, but at k=2, if y=3, occ, so we can be on y=3 at k=3, for example, with one delay.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at k=7, we need 6 U actions in 7 steps, so one S or D.\n\nFor example:\n\nk=0: U to y1=2\n\nk=1: S to y2=2 (not U, so at k=2, y=2 not 3)\n\nk=2: U to y3=3 at k=3\n\nk=3: U to y4=4 at k=4\n\nk4: U to y5=5 at k5\n\nk5: U to y6=6 at k6\n\nk6: U to y7=7 at k7\n\nThen at k=7, y=7.\n\nBut as before, from y=7 at k=7, no safe action for k=8.\n\nIf we have a D somewhere, we can be lower at k=7.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at k=7, it requires being on y=3 at k=2, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can reach y=9 is at k=9 or later.\n\nFor example, at k=8, be on y=2, then go up, but to be on y=2 at k=8, then U to y3 at k=9, but y3 occ at k=9, so we need to wait until k=10 to go to y3.\n\nThen from y3 at k=10, U to y4 at k=11, and so on to y9 at k=16.\n\nH large.\n\nBut we can be higher at k=8.\n\nAt k=8, safe positions are y=0,1,2,9.\n\nIf we can be on y=9 at k=8, but to be on y=9 at k=8, we need to be on y=8 at k=7, which we can't because of the early issue.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=9 at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, at k=9, we can be on y=9 if we were on y=8 at k=8, but y=8 occ at k=8, so we cannot be on y=8 at k=8.\n\nThe only way to be on y=9 at k=9 is to be on y=8 at k=8, but y=8 occ at k=8, so impossible to be on y=8 at k=8.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 at k=9 either, because to be on y=9 at k=9, we must be on y=8 at k=8 or y=9 at k=8 with S, but y=9 at k=8 not possible since y=8 at k=7 max.\n\ny at k=9 can be 9 only if we were on y=8 at k=8 and take U, or on y=9 at k=8 and take S, but y=9 at k=8 not possible.\n\nSo only from y=8 at k=8 take U to y9 at k=9.\n\nBut y=8 at k=8 occupied, so collision at k=8 if we are there.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible to reach y=9 is at k=10 or later.\n\nFor example, at k=10, we can be on y=9 if we were on y=8 at k=9, but at k=9, y=8 occupied, so we cannot be on y=8 at k=9.\n\nSimilarly, at k=10, to be on y=9, we need to be on y=8 at k=9 or y=9 at k=9.\n\ny=9 at k=9 safe, but to be on y=9 at k=9, we must be on y=8 at k=8 or y=9 at k=8.\n\ny=9 at k=8 impossible, y=8 at k=8 occupied, so cannot be on y=9 at k=9.\n\nAt k=11, similarly, to be on y=9 at k=11, we can be on y=8 at k=10 and take U.\n\nAt k=10, y=8 is free, since occ only k=8,9.\n\ny=8 occupied at k=8,9, not at k=10.\n\nSo at k=10, we can be on y=8, free, then take U to y11=9 at k=11.\n\nThen at k=11, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=8 at k=10.\n\nFrom start, with no collisions.\n\ny=8 at k=10, need 9 actions from k=0 to k=10, with net +7 in y, since y0=1 to y10=8, so +7, so we can have 7 U and 2 S or D, or 8 U and 1 D, etc., but to min time, we should have as many U as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid the occupied points.\n\nSpecifically, at k=1 and k=2, avoid y=3 and y=4.\n\nAlso, at k=8 and k=9, avoid y=3 to 8, but since we are going to y=8 at k=10, we might not be there at k=8,9.\n\nLet's plan a path to y=8 at k=10.\n\nStart at k=0, y=1\n\nWe can go to y=2 at k=1 with U.\n\nk=0: U to y1=2\n\nk=1: (2,1) take S to y2=2 at k=2 (avoid y=3)\n\nk=2: (2,2) take U to y3=3 at k=3\n\nk=3: (3,3) take U to y4=4 at k=4\n\nk4: (4,4) U to y5=5 at k5\n\nk5: (5,5) U to y6=6 at k6\n\nk6: (6,6) U to y7=7 at k7\n\nk7: (7,7) U to y8=8 at k8\n\nBut at k=8, (8,8) occupied! Collision.\n\nAt k=7, y=7, we cannot go to y=8 at k=8 because occ.\n\nSo from k=7, we need to go down or stay, but y=7 at k=8 occ.\n\nSo at k=7, we should be lower.\n\nFor example, at k=7, be on y=3, as before.\n\nThen from there, after k=9, go up.\n\nBut we want to be at y=8 at k=10.\n\nSo from k=7 to k=10.\n\nAt k=7, y=3, free.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nk7: (3,7) take U to y8=4 at k8\n\nBut at k=8, y=4 occupied! Collision.\n\nBecause y=4 occ at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, if take S, y8=3 at k8, occ.\n\nTake D, y8=2 at k8, safe.\n\nThen at k=8, (2,8) free.\n\nThen from here, go up to y=8 at k=10.\n\nAt k=8: (2,8) take U to y9=3 at k9\n\nBut at k=9, (3,9) occupied, collision.\n\nTake S, y9=2 at k9, free.\n\nThen at k=9, (2,9) take U to y10=3 at k10\n\nAt k=10, (3,10) free (as before)\n\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at k=10, from y=3 at k=10, we need to go up 5 times, so at k=15, etc.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nAt k=8, (2,8) take U to y9=3, but occ at k=9, so we can't.\n\nWe must wait until k=10 to go to y=3.\n\nSo at k=8: (2,8) take S to y9=2 at k9\n\nk9: (2,9) take U to y10=3 at k10\n\nk10: (3,10) U to y11=4 at k11\n\nk11: (4,11) U to y12=5 at k12\n\nk12: (5,12) U to y13=6 at k13\n\nk13: (6,13) U to y14=7 at k14\n\nk14: (7,14) U to y15=8 at k15\n\nk15: (8,15) U to y16=9 at k16\n\nBut at k=15, y=8, is it free? y=8 occ at k=8,9, not at k=15, so free.\n\nThen at k=16, y=9, safe.\n\nBut this is H=16, from k=0 to k=16, 16 turns, actions from k=0 to k=15.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince at k=10, y=3 is free, and we can go up fast after that.\n\nBut the bottleneck is the early and late occupations.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 or 6 before k=8, but at k=8, we need to be on safe y.\n\nFor example, at k=7, be on y=3, take D to y=2 at k=8.\n\nThen at k=8, on y=2.\n\nThen at k=8, take U to y9=3, but occ at k=9, so instead, take S to y9=2 at k9.\n\nThen at k=9, on y=2, take U to y10=3 at k10, free.\n\nThen from k=10, go up to y=9 in 6 steps: to y4 at k11, y5 k12, y6 k13, y7 k14, y8 k15, y9 k16.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut from y=3 at k=10, to y=9 at k=16, 6 steps.\n\nCan we be higher at k=10?\n\nFor example, at k=7, instead of y=3, be on y=4, but from y=4 at k=7, no safe action for k=8, as all next positions occ.\n\nSo we must be on y=3 at k=7 or lower.\n\ny=3 is the highest possible at k=7 that allows safe transition to k=8.\n\nThen at k=10, we are on y=3.\n\nBut we can go up between k=3 to k=7 to be higher at k=7.\n\nFor example, from start:\n\nk0: U to y1=2\n\nk1: S to y2=2\n\nk2: U to y3=3 at k3\n\nk3: U to y4=4 at k4\n\nk4: U to y5=5 at k5\n\nk5: U to y6=6 at k6\n\nk6: U to y7=7 at k7\n\nBut at k=7, y=7, then we have to go down or something, but to avoid k=8, we can take D to y=6 at k=8, but occ, or to y=8 occ.\n\nNo, so we must not be on high y at k=7.\n\nSo at k=6, we can be on y=6, but at k=6, (6,6) free, then at k=6, take D to y7=5 at k7\n\nThen at k=7, (5,7) free\n\nThen from y=5 at k=7, to y=4,5,6 at k=8, all occ, collision.\n\nTake S, y7=6 at k7, then at k=7, (6,7) free, but to k=8, same.\n\nOr take U to y7=7 at k7, same as before.\n\nSo no, at k=7, if we are on y=5,6,7, no safe k=8.\n\nOnly if on y=3 or lower.\n\nSo to have a path, we need to be at y=3 at k=7.\n\nThen from there, at k=7, take D to y8=2 at k8\n\nThen at k=8, (2,8) take S to y9=2 at k9 (avoid y=3 at k=9)\n\nThen at k=9, (2,9) take U to y10=3 at k10\n\nThen U to y11=4 at k11\n\nU to y12=5 at k12\n\nU to y13=6 at k13\n\nU to y14=7 at k14\n\nU to y15=8 at k15\n\nU to y16=9 at k16\n\nAt k=15, (8,15) free, k=16 (9,16) free.\n\nH=16.\n\nBut we can go faster after k=10.\n\nAt k=10, y=3, we can go directly up without stopping.\n\nBut y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, so k=10 to k=16.\n\nMin k for y=9 is 16.\n\nBut perhaps we can be higher at k=10.\n\nFor example, if at k=7, we are on y=3, and we go down to y=2 at k=8, then at k=8, on y=2, instead of staying, we can go to y=3 at k=9, but occ, so we must stay or go down.\n\nSo we can only go to y=3 at k=10.\n\nSo y=3 at k=10 is the earliest we can be on y=3 after k=9.\n\nThen from there, min k to y=9 is k=16.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions from turn t=3 (k=0):\n\nTo be at y=3 at k=10.\n\nWe need to define the sequence.\n\nStart at t=3, k=0, y=1\n\nAction a3: U, to y=2 at t=4, k=1\n\nt=4, k=1, y=2\n\nAction a4: S, to y=2 at t=5, k=2\n\nt=5, k=2, y=2\n\nAction a5: U, to y=3 at t=6, k=3\n\nt=6, k=3, y=3\n\nAction a6: U, to y=4 at t=7, k=4\n\nt=7, k=4, y=4\n\nAction a7: U, to y=5 at t=8, k=5\n\nt=8, k=5, y=5\n\nAction a8: U, to y=6 at t=9, k=6\n\nt=9, k=6, y=6\n\nAction a9: U, to y=7 at t=10, k=7\n\nt=10, k=7, y=7\n\nBut at k=7, y=7, we need to go down to y=2 for k=8.\n\nFrom y=7, take D to y=6, but at k=8, y=6 occ.\n\nWe need to take actions to be at y=3 at k=7.\n\nIn the sequence above, at k=7, we are at y=7, not y=3.\n\nTo be at y=3 at k=7, we need to have taken fewer U actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=3, k=0, y=1, take S, to y=1 at t=4, k=1\n\nt=4, k=1, y=1, take S, to y=1 at t=5, k=2\n\nt=5, k=2, y=1, take U, to y=2 at t=6, k=3\n\nt=6, k=3, y=2, take U, to y=3 at t=7, k=4\n\nt=7, k=4, y=3, take S, to y=3 at t=8, k=5\n\nt=8, k=5, y=3, take S, to y=3 at t=9, k=6\n\nt=9, k=6, y=3, take S, to y=3 at t=10, k=7\n\nAt t=10, k=7, y=3, free.\n\nThen action a10: D, to y=2 at t=11, k=8\n\nAt t=11, k=8, y=2, free.\n\nThen action a11: S, to y=2 at t=12, k=9\n\nAt t=12, k=9, y=2, free.\n\nThen action a12: U, to y=3 at t=13, k=10\n\nAt t=13, k=10, y=3, free.\n\nThen action a13: U, to y=4 at t=14, k=11\n\na14: U, to y=5 at t=15, k=12\n\na15: U, to y=6 at t=16, k=13\n\na16: U, to y=7 at t=17, k=14\n\na17: U, to y=8 at t=18, k=15\n\na18: U, to y=9 at t=19, k=16\n\nAt t=19, k=16, y=9.\n\nH=17 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from a3 to a18, that's 16 actions, from t=3 to t=18, at t=19, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns from t=3 to t=19 is 17 turns, but the sequence is actions from t=3 to t=18, H=16 actions, and at turn t=3+16-1=18, y=9? t=3+H-1=3+16-1=18, y=9 at t=18? In the sequence, after a18 at t=18, y19=9, so at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nBut we need y at turn t=3+H-1 to be 9.\n\nTurn after H actions: after H actions, we are at turn t=3+H, position y_{3+H}.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn t=3, position y=1.\n\nAfter action a3, we set y4.\n\nAt turn t=4, position y4, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions (at t=3 to t=3+H-1), at turn t=3+H, position y_{3+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{3+H} =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t=3+H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nIn the above, at t=19, y=9, so H such that 3+H=19, H=16.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=18.\n\nBut we can optimize.\n\nAt k=10, y=3, we can go up continuously since no occupation after k=9 for the lower rows.\n\nFor example, from k=10 to k=16, but k=10 y=3 to k=16 y=9, that's 6 steps, but we can do it in 6 turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to reach k=10 first.\n\nMin k to reach y=3 with no collision is k=3, but then we stay until k=7, which is slow.\n\nWe can reach y=3 at k=3, then go up to higher y, but at k=7, we need to be at y=3, so we have to go down or stay.\n\nFor example, at k=3, y=3, we can go U to y4 at k=4, U to y5 at k=5, then at k=5, y=5, free, then we can take D to y4 at k=6, but y=4 at k=6 free, then D to y3 at k=7.\n\nSo:\n\nk0: U to y1=2\n\nk1: S to y2=2\n\nk2: U to y3=3 at k3\n\nk3: U to y4=4 at k4\n\nk4: U to y5=5 at k5\n\nk5: D to y6=4 at k6  (action at k=5, D, so y6 = y5 + (-1) =5-1=4 at k=6)\n\nk6: D to y7=3 at k7  (action at k=6, D, y7=4-1=3)\n\nThen at k=7, y=3, free.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we reached y=5 at k=5, then down to y=3 at k=7.\n\nThen from k=7, D to y8=2 at k8\n\nThen at k=8, y=2, S to y9=2 at k9\n\nU to y10=3 at k10\n\nThen U to y11=4, etc to y16=9.\n\nSame as before, no time saved.\n\nAt k=10, y=3, we can go U each turn to y=9 at k=16.\n\nBut k=16 is late.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by being on a higher row at k=10.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=4 at k=10.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at k=10, from start.\n\nBut at k=2, we cannot be on y=4, etc., but after k=2, we can go up.\n\nMax y at k=10: with all U, y10=1+10=11, but capped at 9, so y10=9 possible, but we have to avoid occupation.\n\nBut at k=1 and k=2, we need to be on y<=2.\n\nSo for example:\n\nk0: U to y1=2\n\nk1: S to y2=2\n\nk2: U to y3=3 at k3\n\nk3: U to y4=4 at k4\n\nk4: U to y5=5 at k5\n\nk5: U to y6=6 at k6\n\nk6: U to y7=7 at k7\n\nAt k=7, y=7, we need to go to safe at k=8, so we must go down to y=2 or something, but from y=7, we can go D multiple times, but at k=8, we can be on y=2.\n\nFor example, at k=7, y=7, take D to y8=6 at k8, but occ, not good.\n\nTake D multiple times before k=8.\n\nBut at each step, we can only change by 1.\n\nFrom y=7 at k=7, to be at y=2 at k=8, impossible in one step.\n\nThe earliest we can be at low y is by going down from k=7.\n\nBut at k=7, if we take D, y8=6 at k8 occ.\n\nOr if we are at lower y at k=7.\n\nSo to be at y=2 at k=8, we must be at y=2 or 1 or 3 at k=7, and take appropriate action.\n\nIf at k=7, y=3, take D to y=2 at k=8.\n\nIf at k=7, y=2, take S to y=2 at k=8 or D to y=1 at k=8.\n\n Etc.\n\nSo the highest we can be at k=8 is y=2.\n\nThen at k=10, we are at y=3.\n\nSo I think k=16 for y=9 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut let's accept that and write the sequence.\n\nTo save some actions, after k=10, we go directly up.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn t=3 (k=0): S (stay at y=1, to avoid moving up too fast)\n\nAfter action, y at t=4 is 1.\n\nTurn t=4 (k=1): S (stay at y=1)\n\ny at t=5 is 1.\n\nTurn t=5 (k=2): U (up to y=2)\n\ny at t=6 is 2.\n\nTurn t=6 (k=3): U (up to y=3)\n\ny at t=7 is 3.\n\nTurn t=7 (k=4): S (stay to be at y=3 for later)\n\ny at t=8 is 3.\n\nTurn t=8 (k=5): S (stay)\n\ny at t=9 is 3.\n\nTurn t=9 (k=6): S (stay)\n\ny at t=10 is 3.\n\nTurn t=10 (k=7): D (down to y=2, to avoid occupation at k=8)\n\ny at t=11 is 2.\n\nTurn t=11 (k=8): S (stay at y=2, safe)\n\ny at t=12 is 2.\n\nTurn t=12 (k=9): U (up to y=3, but at k=10, since action at t=12 sets y13 for k=10)\n\nAt turn t=12, k=9, y=2, take U, so y13 =2+1=3 at turn t=13, k=10.\n\nTurn t=13 (k=10): U (up to y=4)\n\ny at t=14 is 4.\n\nTurn t=14 (k=11): U (to y=5)\n\ny at t=15 is 5.\n\nTurn t=15 (k=12): U (to y=6)\n\ny at t=16 is 6.\n\nTurn t=16 (k=13): U (to y=7)\n\ny at t=17 is 7.\n\nTurn t=17 (k=14): U (to y=8)\n\ny at t=18 is 8.\n\nTurn t=18 (k=15): U (to y=9)\n\ny at t=19 is 9.\n\nSo at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=18, H=16 actions.\n\nThe sequence is for t=3 to t=18.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be from Turn t1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nt1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAt turn 19, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=16.\n\nBut perhaps we can reduce by going up faster after k=10.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=13 to t=18, we go U from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps, which is necessary.\n\nBut before that, from k=0 to k=10, we have 10 turns to go from y=1 to y=3, which is slow.\n\nWe can go faster in the beginning.\n\nFor example, at k=0, U to y=2 at k=1\n\nk=1, S to y=2 at k=2\n\nk=2, U to y=3 at k=3\n\nThen at k=3, y=3, instead of staying, we can go U to y=4 at k=4, U to y=5 at k=5, then at k=5, y=5, we need to go back to y=3 at k=7.\n\nSo at k=5, y=5, take D to y=4 at k=6\n\nk=6, y=4, take D to y=3 at k=7\n\nThen same as before.\n\nThen from k=7, D to y=2 at k=8\n\nS to y=2 at k=9\n\nU to y=3 at k=10\n\nThen U to y=9 at k=16.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo H=16 seems the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose at k=8, we are on y=2, then at k=8, take U to y=3 at k=9, but occ, so not possible.\n\nOr at k=9, take U to y=4 at k=10, but at k=10, y=4 is free, but we need to be on y=3 at k=9 to go to y=4 at k=10, but y=3 at k=9 occ.\n\nSo we can only be on y=3 at k=10.\n\nSo I think it's not possible to do better.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, we have D, which is down, but y=0 is safe, so no problem.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5 to 8, only one car each, occupied at k=8,9, but we avoided.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, we have S at some points.\n\nNow to write the action sequence.\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter Turn 18 action, y at turn 19 is 9.\n\nH=16 actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns: actions from t=3 to t=18, 16 turns.\n\nAt turn t=3+H-1=19, y=9, so 3+H-1=19, H=17? Let's calculate.\n\nStart at turn t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter first action a3 at t=3, y at t=4 is set.\n\nAfter H actions, y at turn t=3+H is set to some value.\n\nWe want y_{3+H} =9.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, y at t=3 is 1.\n\nAfter 1 action, y at t=4.\n\nAfter H actions, y at t=3+H.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nSo t=3+H =19, so H=16.\n\nThen actions from t=3 to t=3+H-1=3+15=18.\n\nt=3 to t=18 inclusive is 16 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 12, we have U, which sets y13=3 at t=13, k=10.\n\nThen U at t=13 to y14=4, etc.\n\nUp to U at t=18 to y19=9.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut perhaps we can have a shorter path by using y=0 or something, but I think it won't help.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the player must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving, at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. If we move at turn T to a new freeway, then at turn T we are still on the old freeway (y_T) and only at T+1 we are on the new one. So we must avoid collisions for the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\nWe are starting at turn 4 at y=1. We can take actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the exact turn when we are on them and the car's span at that turn covers 0.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1 (which is 4). For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n\n- For left-moving (d='left'): the car moves to the left. The span at time t1 is [h, τ] (but note: in the update, for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at τ, and as time increases, the entire car moves left by s*(T-t1). So at time T, the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\n- For right-moving (d='right'): the span at time t1 is [τ, h] (since tail is at τ and head at h, and it moves right). At time T, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T happens if the player is on freeway k at turn T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from turn 4 to turn 4+H-1 such that at turn 4+H-1, y=9.\n\nWe start at y=1 (turn 4). We want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any cars would be 8 moves (only up). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe note that the cars are on freeways 1 to 8. We are currently on freeway 1 at turn 4.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway and each turn (starting from turn 4) whether at that turn, if we are on that freeway, is 0 in the span of any car on that freeway?\n\nBut note: the car configurations are given at turn 4. We need to compute for each car on each freeway the span at any turn T (relative to turn 4: T = 4,5,6,...).\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 4. Then at a future turn T (>=4), the time elapsed is dt = T - 4.\n\nFor each car, we can compute the span at time T.\n\nWe are particularly interested in whether at time T, the car's span covers 0.\n\nLet's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36) -> left-moving. At time T, the span is [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt]. We require 0 in [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]. So:\n  48 - 36*dt <= 0 <= 83 - 36*dt\n\nBut note: because the car is long, and moving left, we can solve for dt:\n\n  48 - 36*dt <= 0  => dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> so for dt>=2, the left end is <=0? Actually, let's check:\n\n  For dt=1: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> 0 not in [12,47]\n  dt=2: [48-72=-24, 83-72=11] -> 0 is between -24 and 11? -> yes, 0 is in [-24,11] -> so at T=4+2=6, freeway1 is dangerous.\n\n  Actually, we are at turn T, so at turn 6, if we are on freeway1, we collide.\n\n  How about dt=0 (T=4): [48,83] -> 0 not in [48,83] -> safe at T=4 for freeway1.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1: one car (48,83,left,36) -> same as above. So at T=6, freeway2 is dangerous.\n\nFreeway3: three cars:\n  car1: (-42, -53, right, 6) -> right-moving: span at T: [-42 + 6*dt, -53 + 6*dt]? \n  Wait, note: the description says for right-moving: the initial span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? \n  Actually, the input says: \"(-42, -53, right, 6)\" -> so head=-42, tail=-53? \n  But for right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? Actually, the input might be (head, tail) and for right-moving, the head is the front (so at the right) and tail at the left? \n\n  The update rule for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  So if head=h and tail=τ, then at T: [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt].\n\n  So for this car: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6 -> [ -53 + 6*dt, -42 + 6*dt ]\n\n  We need 0 in that interval? \n      -53+6*dt <= 0 <= -42+6*dt\n      => 6*dt <= 53 -> dt <= 53/6 ≈ 8.83, and 6*dt >=42 -> dt>=7.\n\n      So for dt in [7, 8] (since dt integer: dt=7,8) -> T=4+7=11, T=4+8=12.\n\n  But we are going to compute for a few turns, and we hope to get to 9 in a few moves.\n\n  Second car on freeway3: (36,25,right,6) -> wait, head=36, tail=25? \n      Then span at T: [25+6*dt, 36+6*dt]. \n      25+6*dt <=0<=36+6*dt -> but 25+6*dt>0 for dt>=0 -> never.\n\n  Third car on freeway3: (0,-11,right,6) -> head=0, tail=-11 -> span at T: [-11+6*dt, 0+6*dt] = [-11+6*dt, 6*dt]\n      We need 0 in [-11+6*dt, 6*dt] -> \n          -11+6*dt <=0 and 0<=6*dt -> always true for dt>=0? \n          But note: at dt=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? (since it's a closed interval) -> so at T=4 (dt=0), 0 is in the span? \n\n      Actually, the car is at freeway3 at T=4: [ -11, 0 ] -> so 0 is included -> so at turn 4, freeway3 is dangerous.\n\n      Therefore, at T=4, if we are on freeway3, we collide.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? \n  Cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) -> same as freeway3? \n  So at T=4, the third car (0,-11,right,6) has span [-11,0] -> so 0 is included -> dangerous at T=4.\n\nFreeway5: only one car: (-42,-53,right,6) -> \n      span: [-53+6*dt, -42+6*dt]\n      We need 0 in that interval: \n        -53+6*dt <=0 and 0<=-42+6*dt -> \n        dt >= 53/6 ≈8.83 -> so dt>=9 -> T=13 and beyond? \n        and dt>=42/6=7 -> so only when dt>=9? \n        Actually: \n          -53+6*dt <=0 -> dt>= ceil(53/6)= ceil(8.83)=9\n          and 0<=-42+6*dt -> 42<=6*dt -> dt>=7 -> but both must hold: so dt>=9.\n\n      So for T=4+9=13 and beyond? Actually, at dt=9: [-53+54=1, -42+54=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> so actually not? \n      We have: \n          -53+6*dt <= 0 <= -42+6*dt\n          At dt=9: 1<=0<=12 -> false.\n      At dt=8: [-53+48=-5, -42+48=6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> yes! \n      So at T=4+8=12, freeway5 is dangerous.\n\n      Actually, we must check: \n          dt=8: [-53+48 = -5, -42+48=6] -> -5<=0<=6 -> yes.\n\n      So dangerous at T=12.\n\nFreeway6: same car as freeway5: (-42,-53,right,6) -> so same as above: dangerous at T=12.\n\nFreeway7: same car: dangerous at T=12.\n\nFreeway8: same car: dangerous at T=12.\n\nBut note: we are starting at turn4 at y=1. We want to get to y=9. We must avoid:\n\n- At turn4: \n    freeway1: safe (as above)\n    freeway2: safe\n    freeway3: dangerous (because of the car (0,-11,right,6) -> [ -11, 0 ] -> includes 0)\n    freeway4: dangerous (same)\n    freeway5: safe (at dt=0: [-53, -42] -> doesn't include 0)\n    freeway6: safe\n    freeway7: safe\n    freeway8: safe\n\nSo at turn4, we are at y=1 (freeway1) -> safe.\n\nNow, we plan the moves. We can only move up, down, or stay. We start at y=1 and want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal moves would be 8 moves of U. But we must avoid collisions at each turn.\n\nWe must consider the freeway we are on at each turn and the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are at turn4: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe.\n\nTurn5: we can choose to go U (to y=2), D (to y=0) or S (stay at y=1). But note: we cannot go below 0, so D at y=1 would go to 0? \n  But at y=0, there is no freeway? The freeways are from 1 to 8. The player at y=0 is safe (because no cars). Similarly, y=9 is the goal and no cars? Actually, the goal is (0,9) and there are no cars above freeway8 (freeways are 1-8). So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nSo at turn5, if we go U: then we are at y=2 at turn5 -> freeway2 at turn5: \n  freeway2 has a car: (48,83,left,36). At turn5 (dt=1): span = [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nIf we go D: to y=0 -> safe.\n\nIf we stay: y=1 -> freeway1 at turn5: \n  freeway1: at dt=1: [48-36=12,83-36=47] -> safe.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we might try to go up.\n\nHowever, we note that at turn6, freeway1 and freeway2 become dangerous? \n  freeway1 at turn6 (dt=2): [48-72=-24,83-72=11] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n  freeway2 at turn6: same -> dangerous.\n\nSo if we are on freeway1 or freeway2 at turn6, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway1 or freeway2 at turn6.\n\nAt turn4: we are at y=1.\n\nAt turn5: we choose an action that will determine our position at turn5.\n\nAt turn6: we must not be at y=1 or y=2.\n\nOptions:\n\nOption 1: at turn5, we go up to y=2. Then at turn6, we must leave freeway2. We can go up to y=3, or down to y=1? But y=1 is also dangerous at turn6. So we must go to y=3 at turn6? \n\nBut note: if we go up from y=2 at turn5 to y=3 at turn6, then at turn5 we are at freeway2 -> which is safe (as above). Then at turn6, we are at freeway3. But freeway3 at turn6 (dt=2) is dangerous? \n\nLet's check freeway3 at turn6 (dt=2):\n\n  The cars on freeway3:\n    car1: (-42,-53,right,6): span = [-53+6*2=-41, -42+12=-30] -> [-41,-30] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n    car2: (36,25,right,6): [25+12=37, 36+12=48] -> no.\n    car3: (0,-11,right,6): [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn6 (dt=2) is safe? \n\nBut wait: at turn4 (dt=0), freeway3 was dangerous because of the third car: [ -11, 0 ] included 0. At dt=2: that car becomes [ -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 is not included.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 at turn6: same as freeway3? \n  The cars: same configuration? \n  car1: [-53+12=-41, -42+12=-30] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+12=37,36+12=48] -> safe.\n  car3: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway4 at turn6 is safe.\n\nBut note: we are considering going from y=2 at turn5 to y=3 at turn6 -> that would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could go from y=2 at turn5 to y=1 at turn6? But y=1 is dangerous at turn6 -> not allowed.\n\nOr stay at y=2 at turn6? -> dangerous.\n\nSo we must leave freeway2 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=2 at turn5, then at turn6 we must go to y=3 (or possibly y=1 is dangerous, so only y=3? but also we cannot go to y=3 if it is dangerous? we just checked that y=3 at turn6 is safe).\n\nWhat if we go down from y=2 at turn5? Then at turn6 we would be at y=1? which is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\nSo only option from y=2 at turn5 is to go up to y=3 at turn6.\n\nNow, what about other moves at turn5?\n\nWe could at turn5 go down to y=0. Then at turn5, we are at y=0 (safe). Then at turn6, we can go up to y=1? But y=1 at turn6 is dangerous -> not allowed. Or stay at y=0? safe. But we are at y=0 and we need to go to y=9 -> that would take longer.\n\nWe could stay at turn5 at y=1. Then at turn6 we must leave freeway1 (because it's dangerous at turn6). So we can go up to y=2? but freeway2 at turn6 is dangerous -> not allowed. Or down to y=0? safe.\n\nSo if we stay at y=1 at turn5, then at turn6 we must go down to y=0.\n\nThen we are at y=0 at turn6 (safe). Then we can start moving up again? But that might be slow.\n\nSo the faster option is to go up at turn5 to y=2, then at turn6 to y=3.\n\nNow, at turn6, we are at y=3 (freeway3) -> safe (as computed above).\n\nThen we want to go to y=9. How?\n\nWe need to check the future dangers.\n\nWe note that freeway1 and freeway2 become dangerous at turn6, but we are at turn6 at y=3 -> safe. Then at turn7, what about the freeways?\n\nBut note: the dangers we computed for freeway5,6,7,8 are at turn12 and beyond. We are at turn6, so we have 6 turns to get to y=9? \n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn6. We need to get to y=9: that requires 6 more moves (if we go up every move) -> then we would be at y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut at turn12, we must avoid:\n\n  freeway5,6,7,8: all have the same car: (-42,-53,right,6) -> at turn12 (dt=8): \n      span = [-53+6*8 = -53+48 = -5, -42+48=6] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\nSo at turn12, if we are on freeway5,6,7, or 8, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway5,6,7,8 at turn12.\n\nBut note: we are going to be moving up from y=3 at turn6 to y=9 at turn12 (if we go up every move). Then:\n\n  turn6: y=3 -> freeway3 (safe)\n  turn7: y=4 -> freeway4\n  turn8: y=5 -> freeway5\n  turn9: y=6 -> freeway6\n  turn10: y=7 -> freeway7\n  turn11: y=8 -> freeway8\n  turn12: y=9 -> goal (safe, because no freeway at y=9)\n\nBut wait: at turn12, we are at y=9 -> not on any freeway? so safe.\n\nHowever, note that at turn11, we are at y=8 (freeway8) at turn11: \n  freeway8 at turn11 (dt=11-4=7): \n      car: (-42,-53,right,6): span = [-53+6*7 = -53+42 = -11, -42+42=0] -> so [ -11, 0 ] -> includes 0? \n          -11<=0<=0 -> yes, 0 is included -> dangerous.\n\nSo at turn11, if we are at freeway8, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway8 at turn11 (dt=7) -> which is turn4+7=11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn11: same car? \n  freeway7: same car -> so at turn11 (dt=7): [ -53+42=-11, -42+42=0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 and freeway5 at turn11? \n  freeway6: same car -> dangerous.\n  freeway5: same car -> dangerous.\n\nBut note: at turn11 (dt=7), freeway4: \n  The cars on freeway4: \n      (-42,-53,right,6): same as above -> dangerous? \n      But wait, freeway4 has three cars? Actually, no: from the table, freeway4 has the same three cars as freeway3? \n\n  Actually, the table says for freeway4: \n        (-42, -53, right, 6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\n  So at turn11 (dt=7):\n      car1: (-42,-53,right,6): [ -53+42=-11, -42+42=0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n      car2: (36,25,right,6): [25+42=67, 36+42=78] -> safe.\n      car3: (0,-11,right,6): [-11+42=31, 0+42=42] -> safe.\n\n  So because of car1, freeway4 is dangerous at turn11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 at turn11 (dt=7):\n      car1: same -> dangerous.\n\nBut we are not going to be at freeway3 at turn11? because we are moving up.\n\nSo the problem is: we cannot be on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn11? \n\nBut wait: freeway3 at turn11: \n  car1: [-53+42=-11, -42+42=0] -> dangerous? \n  car2: [25+42=67,36+42=78] -> safe.\n  car3: [-11+42=31,0+42=42] -> safe.\n  So car1 makes freeway3 dangerous at turn11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 at turn11 (dt=7): \n  freeway2 has one car: (48,83,left,36) -> at dt=7: [48-36*7=48-252=-204, 83-252=-169] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nfreeway1 at turn11: same as freeway2 -> safe.\n\nSo the only safe freeways at turn11 (dt=7) are freeway1 and freeway2? \n\nBut we are at y=8 at turn11? and freeway8 is dangerous. So we must avoid being at y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn11.\n\nBut we are moving up: from turn6 (y=3) to turn11 (we are at y=3 at turn6, then we go up 5 moves: turn7->y=4, turn8->y=5, turn9->y=6, turn10->y=7, turn11->y=8) -> so we are at y=8 at turn11 -> freeway8 -> dangerous.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do 5 consecutive ups from turn6 to turn11.\n\nWe must delay or avoid being at freeway8 at turn11.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nWe must adjust the timing so that we are not at freeway8 at turn11. But note that the danger at freeway8 is at turn11 (and also at turn12, but we are going to y=9 at turn12 which is safe). \n\nSo we need to be at freeway8 either before turn11 or after turn11? \n\nBut the car on freeway8 is dangerous at turn11 and turn12? \n  At turn11 (dt=7): [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n  At turn12 (dt=8): [-5,6] -> dangerous.\n  At turn13 (dt=9): [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 is safe again at turn13.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7,6,5,4,3: \n  freeway3: at turn13 (dt=9): \n        car1: [-53+54=1, -42+54=12] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+54=79,36+54=90] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+54=43,0+54=54] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn13, all freeways from 3 to 8 are safe? \n\nBut note: we are trying to minimize H. \n\nWe are at turn6 at y=3. We want to get to y=9. We have to avoid being at freeways 3-8 at turns 11 and 12? because they are dangerous then? \n\nActually, freeways 3-8 are dangerous at turns 11 and 12? \n\nLet me check freeway3 at turn12 (dt=8): \n  car1: [-53+48=-5, -42+48=6] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n  car2: [25+48=73,36+48=84] -> safe.\n  car3: [-11+48=37,0+48=48] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 is dangerous at turn12 as well? \n\nBut at turn13, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: same as freeway3? \n  car1: dangerous at turn12? \n      [-53+48=-5, -42+48=6] -> yes.\n\nSo freeways 3-8 are dangerous at turn11 and turn12.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turns 11 and 12.\n\nWe are at turn6 (y=3) and we want to get to y=9. The minimal moves would be 6 moves (if we go up 6 times: then we would be at y=9 at turn12). But at turn12, we are at y=9 -> safe. However, we have to go through the freeways at intermediate turns.\n\nSpecifically, we must avoid being at freeways 3-8 at turns 11 and 12. \n\nBut note: at turn12, we are at y=9 -> not on any freeway. So we only care about turn11.\n\nAt turn11, we must not be on freeways 3-8. So we must be at freeway1, freeway2, or y=0 or y=9? \n\nBut we are moving up. At turn11, we are at y = 3 + (number of ups from turn6 to turn11) - (number of downs) ... \n\nWe have 5 moves from turn6 to turn11: \n  turn6: y=3\n  turn7: y=?\n  ...\n  turn11: y=?\n\nWe must have at turn11: y not in {3,4,5,6,7,8}. So y must be 0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut we are going up, so we might be able to go to y=9 by turn11? \n\nWe start at turn6: y=3. We have 5 moves (turn7 to turn11) to get to at least y=9? \n\nBut 5 moves: maximum we can go up 5 moves: 3+5=8 -> y=8 at turn11 -> not safe.\n\nTo get to y=9 at turn11, we need 6 moves? but we only have 5 moves? \n\nAlternatively, we can go down? but that would make us even lower.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 at turn11 with only 5 moves from y=3.\n\nWe must be at y=0,1, or 2 at turn11.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn6. How to get to y=0,1,2 at turn11? \n\nWe can go down for 3 moves: then we would be at y=0 at turn9? Then we can stay at y=0 for two moves? Then at turn11 we are at y=0 -> safe. But then we have to go up 9 moves to get to y=9 -> total moves from turn6: 5 (to get to turn11) and then 9 more to get to y=9 -> total turns from turn6: 14? which is too long.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down for 1 move to y=2 at turn7, then we can wait? But then we have to avoid the dangers at freeway2 at turn6? We are at turn6 at y=3 -> safe. Then at turn7, we go down to y=2 -> freeway2 at turn7: \n  freeway2 at turn7 (dt=3): [48-36*3=48-108=-60,83-108=-25] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nThen we can stay at y=2 for several moves? But we must avoid freeway2 at turn6? We were not at freeway2 at turn6. But note: freeway2 was dangerous at turn6? but we were at y=3 at turn6. \n\nNow, at turn8: we are at y=2? then freeway2 at turn8 (dt=4): [48-144=-96,83-144=-61] -> safe.\n\nBut we need to be at y=0,1,2 at turn11. So we can stay at y=2 from turn7 to turn11? That would be 5 turns at y=2? \n  Then at turn11, we are at y=2 -> freeway2 -> safe (as we saw freeway2 is safe at dt=7: [48-36*7=-204,83-252=-169] -> safe).\n\nThen after turn11, we can move up. But we need to get to y=9. From y=2 at turn11, we need 7 moves (U) to get to y=9 -> then at turn18 we reach y=9.\n\nBut that is H= (from turn4: we are at turn6: that's 2 turns, then from turn7 to turn11: 5 turns, then 7 moves from turn12 to turn18: total 2+5+7=14 moves? and then we are at turn4+14-1 = turn17? wait, let me count:\n\n  We are at turn4: y=1.\n  turn5: U -> y=2\n  turn6: U -> y=3 -> so far 2 moves (turn5 and turn6) and we are at turn6 at y=3.\n\n  Then from turn6 to turn11: we are going to do 5 moves: \n        turn7: D -> y=2\n        turn8: S -> y=2\n        turn9: S -> y=2\n        turn10: S -> y=2\n        turn11: S -> y=2\n\n  Then from turn12: we start moving up: \n        turn12: U -> y=3\n        turn13: U -> y=4\n        turn14: U -> y=5\n        turn15: U -> y=6\n        turn16: U -> y=7\n        turn17: U -> y=8\n        turn18: U -> y=9\n\n  So we reach at turn18: H = 18 - 4 = 14? But note: we start at turn4 and we do 14 actions? \n\n  Actually, the sequence of actions: \n      at turn4: we are at the start, then we do actions at turn4, turn5, ... until the action that gets us to y=9 at the end of the last turn.\n\n  How many actions? We start at turn4. We do an action at turn4? \n\n  The problem says: \n      \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n      so t=0 corresponds to a_{t1} = a_4, t=1: a_5, ... until a_{t1+H-1} = a_{4+H-1}.\n\n  And after H actions, we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\n  Actually, after the action at turn t, we get the position at turn t+1? \n\n  The update: \n      at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we get y_{t+1}.\n\n  So we start at turn4: y4=1. \n      We do action a4 at turn4 -> then we get y5.\n      Then a5 at turn5 -> y6, etc.\n\n  We need to be at y_{4+H} = 9? \n\n  But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" -> so at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n  That means: after doing H actions (from turn4 to turn4+H-1), the last action (at turn4+H-1) leads to position at turn4+H = 9? \n\n  Actually, the state at turn t1 is given. Then we take an action at turn t1 (which is a_{t1}) and that updates to turn t1+1. Then we take a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, and so on. \n\n  So after H actions, we have advanced H turns: we are at turn t1+H. \n\n  And we require that at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). \n\n  Therefore, we require: \n        y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n  And we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. So H actions.\n\n  So in the example above: we start at turn4, we do:\n\n      turn4: action a4 -> leads to y5 (at turn5)\n      turn5: a5 -> y6 (turn6)\n      ...\n      we want to be at turn4+H = 9.\n\n  So we need H such that 4+H = the turn when we are at y=9.\n\n  In the slow plan: we would be at y=9 at turn18 -> so 4+H=18 -> H=14.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nAlternatively, we might find a faster way.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeways 3-8 at turns 11 and 12 (turns 4+7=11 and 4+8=12). \n\nBut note: at turn12, we can be at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the only critical turn is turn11: we must not be on freeways 3-8 at turn11.\n\nWe are at turn6 (which is turn4+2) at y=3. We have 5 moves (actions at turn6, turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10) to determine our position at turn11 (which is turn4+7).\n\nAt turn11, we must be at y in {0,1,2,9}. But we cannot be at y=9 with only 5 moves from y=3 (since 3+5=8). So we must be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Option: go down from y=3 to y=2 at turn6? But we are at turn6 at y=3 -> safe. Then at turn6 we choose D: then at turn7 we are at y=2. Then we can stay at y=2 for the next 4 moves (turn7 to turn10: actions S,S,S,S) so that at turn11 we are at y=2.\n\n  Then at turn11: y=2 -> freeway2 -> safe (as freeway2 at dt=7 is safe).\n\n  Then from turn11 onwards, we can go up. But we need to avoid freeways 3-8 at turn12? \n\n  At turn12: we are at y=2? or if we go up at turn11, then at turn12 we are at y=3. \n      But freeway3 at turn12 (dt=8) is dangerous? as we saw -> includes 0.\n\n  So we cannot be at freeway3 at turn12.\n\n  Therefore, if at turn11 we are at y=2, and we go up at turn11, then at turn12 we are at y=3 -> freeway3 -> dangerous.\n\n  If we stay at turn11 at y=2, then at turn12 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 -> safe? \n        freeway2 at turn12 (dt=8): [48-36*8=48-288=-240,83-288=-205] -> safe.\n\n  But then we are still at y=2. We need to get to y=9. \n\n  We can wait at y=2 until the danger at freeways 3-8 is over? which is after turn12. \n\n  At turn13 (dt=9): freeway3 is safe. So at turn12, we are at y=2 (safe). Then at turn12 we go up to y=3 -> freeway3 at turn13: \n        freeway3 at turn13 (dt=9): safe (as above).\n\n  Then we can continue up.\n\n  The plan from turn6 onwards:\n\n      turn6: D -> y=2 (at turn7) \n      turn7: S -> y=2 (turn8)\n      turn8: S -> y=2 (turn9)\n      turn9: S -> y=2 (turn10)\n      turn10: S -> y=2 (turn11)\n      turn11: S -> y=2 (turn12)   [because we avoid turn12 freeways 3-8 by being at y=2]\n      turn12: U -> y=3 (turn13)   [freeway3 at turn13: safe]\n      turn13: U -> y=4 (turn14)   [freeway4 at turn14 (dt=10): \n            car1: [-53+60=7, -42+60=18] -> safe.\n            car2: [25+60=85,36+60=96] -> safe.\n            car3: [-11+60=49,0+60=60] -> safe.\n      turn14: U -> y=5 (turn15)   [freeway5 at turn15 (dt=11): \n            car: [-53+66=13, -42+66=24] -> safe.\n      turn15: U -> y=6 (turn16)   [freeway6: same as freeway5 -> safe]\n      turn16: U -> y=7 (turn17)   [freeway7: safe]\n      turn17: U -> y=8 (turn18)   [freeway8 at turn18 (dt=14): \n            car: [-53+84=31, -42+84=42] -> safe.\n      turn18: U -> y=9 (turn19)   [goal]\n\n  So we reach y=9 at turn19.\n\n  Total actions from turn4 to turn18: 15 actions? \n        turn4: action0, turn5: action1, ... turn18: action14? \n        So H=15.\n\n  But we started at turn4 at y=1. We did:\n\n        turn4: ? \n        turn5: ?\n\n  We haven't defined the first two actions.\n\n  Let me complete:\n\n  At turn4: we are at y=1. We want to get to y=2 by turn5? because at turn6 we want to be at y=3? but in this plan we change: we are going to do:\n\n        turn4: U -> y=2 (at turn5)\n        turn5: U -> y=3 (at turn6)   [then at turn6 we do D?]\n\n  But wait, at turn6: we are at y=3, then we do D -> to y=2 at turn7.\n\n  So the full sequence:\n\n        turn4: U -> y=2 (turn5)\n        turn5: U -> y=3 (turn6)\n        turn6: D -> y=2 (turn7)\n        turn7: S -> y=2 (turn8)\n        turn8: S -> y=2 (turn9)\n        turn9: S -> y=2 (turn10)\n        turn10: S -> y=2 (turn11)\n        turn11: S -> y=2 (turn12)\n        turn12: U -> y=3 (turn13)\n        turn13: U -> y=4 (turn14)\n        turn14: U -> y=5 (turn15)\n        turn15: U -> y=6 (turn16)\n        turn16: U -> y=7 (turn17)\n        turn17: U -> y=8 (turn18)\n        turn18: U -> y=9 (turn19)\n\n  So we take 15 actions: from turn4 to turn18.\n\n  H=15.\n\n  But is there a faster way?\n\nAlternative plan: \n\n  What if at turn6 we don't go down, but go up? \n\n  We are at turn6 at y=3. Then we could go up to y=4 at turn7. Then we are at freeway4 at turn7: \n        freeway4 at turn7 (dt=3): \n            car1: [-53+18=-35, -42+18=-24] -> safe.\n            car2: [25+18=43,36+18=54] -> safe.\n            car3: [-11+18=7,0+18=18] -> safe.\n\n  Then turn7: U -> y=5 at turn8: freeway5 at turn8 (dt=4): \n        car: [-53+24=-29, -42+24=-18] -> safe.\n\n  turn8: U -> y=6 at turn9: freeway6 at turn9 (dt=5): \n        car: [-53+30=-23, -42+30=-12] -> safe.\n\n  turn9: U -> y=7 at turn10: freeway7 at turn10 (dt=6): \n        car: [-53+36=-17, -42+36=-6] -> includes 0? no, because -6 is negative and -17 is negative -> 0 is not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\n  turn10: U -> y=8 at turn11: freeway8 at turn11 (dt=7): \n        car: [-53+42=-11, -42+42=0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous! \n\n  So we cannot do that.\n\n  What if we stop at y=7 at turn10 and then wait? \n        turn10: S -> y=7 at turn11 -> freeway7 at turn11 (dt=7): \n              car: [-53+42=-11, -42+42=0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\n  So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn11 either.\n\n  What if we go up to y=8 at turn10? then at turn11 we are at y=8 -> freeway8 -> dangerous.\n\n  So we must leave freeways 3-8 by turn11. \n\n  Therefore, the only safe freeways at turn11 are 1 and 2. \n\n  We are at y=3 at turn6. We need to get to y=1 or 2 by turn11. \n\n  We can do:\n\n        turn6: D -> y=2 (turn7)\n        turn7: D -> y=1 (turn8) \n        then we can stay at y=1 until turn11? \n\n        But freeway1 at turn11: \n             car: (48,83,left,36) at dt=7: [48-252=-204,83-252=-169] -> safe.\n\n        So we can be at y=1 at turn11.\n\n        Then after turn11, we can move up.\n\n        From turn11: we are at y=1.\n        turn11: U -> y=2 (turn12) -> freeway2 at turn12: safe.\n        turn12: U -> y=3 (turn13) -> freeway3: safe (dt=9)\n        turn13: U -> y=4 (turn14) -> freeway4: safe\n        turn14: U -> y=5 (turn15) -> freeway5: safe\n        turn15: U -> y=6 (turn16) -> freeway6: safe\n        turn16: U -> y=7 (turn17) -> freeway7: safe\n        turn17: U -> y=8 (turn18) -> freeway8: safe (dt=14: as above)\n        turn18: U -> y=9 (turn19)\n\n        This is also 15 actions.\n\n        But we did two downs at turn6 and turn7. \n\n        Sequence:\n\n          turn4: U (y=2 at turn5)\n          turn5: U (y=3 at turn6)\n          turn6: D (y=2 at turn7)\n          turn7: D (y=1 at turn8)\n          turn8: S (y=1 at turn9)\n          turn9: S (y=1 at turn10)\n          turn10: S (y=1 at turn11)\n          turn11: U (y=2 at turn12)\n          ... same as above.\n\n        Still 15 actions.\n\nCan we avoid waiting so long at the lower freeways?\n\nWe note that freeways 3-8 are dangerous only at turns 11 and 12. At turn13, they become safe.\n\nSo we could be at freeways 3-8 at turn13 and beyond.\n\nWe are at turn6: y=3. We have 5 moves to turn11. We want to be at y=1 or 2 at turn11. But we can also be at y=0, but that is even lower.\n\nWhat if we go down to y=0 at some point and then come up quickly? \n\n  turn6: D (y=2 at turn7)\n  turn7: D (y=1 at turn8)\n  turn8: D (y=0 at turn9) \n  then we wait at y=0 until turn12? \n        turn9: S (y=0 at turn10)\n        turn10: S (y=0 at turn11)\n        turn11: U (y=1 at turn12) -> freeway1 at turn12: safe? \n                freeway1 at turn12 (dt=8): [48-288=-240,83-288=-205] -> safe.\n        turn12: U (y=2 at turn13) -> freeway2: safe.\n        turn13: U (y=3 at turn14) -> freeway3: safe (dt=10)\n        ... then up to y=9 by turn19 -> same as before.\n\n  Still 15 actions.\n\nBut can we start moving up earlier? \n\n  At turn11: we are at y=0. We can move up at turn11 to y=1 (safe), then at turn12 to y=2 (safe), then at turn13 to y=3 (safe), and then we can go up quickly. \n\n  But we still need 6 moves from y=0 to y=6 at turn17? then y=9 at turn19? -> same.\n\nIs there a way to be at a higher position at turn13? \n\n  We are at turn11 at y=1. \n      turn11: U -> y=2 (turn12)\n      turn12: U -> y=3 (turn13)\n      turn13: U -> y=4 (turn14)\n      turn14: U -> y=5 (turn15)\n      turn15: U -> y=6 (turn16)\n      turn16: U -> y=7 (turn17)\n      turn17: U -> y=8 (turn18)\n      turn18: U -> y=9 (turn19)\n\n  That's 7 moves from turn11 to turn18 -> 8 actions? (from turn11 to turn18: actions at turn11,12,...,18: 8 actions) -> then from turn4 to turn18: 15 actions.\n\nCan we be at y=2 at turn11 and then move up faster? \n\n  But we can only move one per turn.\n\nWhat if we use a different initial path? \n\n  Instead of going up at turn4 and turn5, what if we go down at turn4? \n\n  turn4: D -> y=0 (turn5) -> safe.\n  turn5: S -> y=0 (turn6) \n  then we can avoid the freeway1 and freeway2 danger at turn6? \n  but we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn6: we are at y=0. We need to get to y=9. We have to avoid freeways 3-8 at turns 11 and 12.\n\n  We have from turn6 to turn11: 5 moves. We can go up to y=5 at turn11? \n        turn6: U -> y=1 (turn7) -> freeway1 at turn7: safe? \n                freeway1 at turn7 (dt=3): [48-108=-60,83-108=-25] -> safe.\n        turn7: U -> y=2 (turn8) -> freeway2: safe (dt=4: [48-144=-96,83-144=-61])\n        turn8: U -> y=3 (turn9) -> freeway3: safe? \n                freeway3 at turn9 (dt=5): \n                    car1: [-53+30=-23,-42+30=-12] -> safe.\n                    car2: [25+30=55,36+30=66] -> safe.\n                    car3: [-11+30=19,0+30=30] -> safe.\n        turn9: U -> y=4 (turn10) -> freeway4: safe (dt=6: \n                    car1: [-53+36=-17, -42+36=-6] -> safe.\n                    car2: [25+36=61,36+36=72] -> safe.\n                    car3: [-11+36=25,0+36=36] -> safe.\n        turn10: U -> y=5 (turn11) -> freeway5 at turn11: dangerous? \n                freeway5 at turn11 (dt=7): [-53+42=-11, -42+42=0] -> dangerous.\n\n  So we cannot be at freeway5 at turn11.\n\n  We could stop at y=4 at turn10 and then turn10: S -> y=4 at turn11 -> freeway4 at turn11: dangerous (because of car1: [-53+42=-11,0] -> dangerous).\n\n  Or we could go down from y=4 at turn10 to y=3 at turn11? -> freeway3 at turn11: dangerous (car1: [-53+42=-11,0] -> dangerous).\n\n  So we must be at y<=2 at turn11.\n\n  We are at turn8: y=2. Then we can stay at y=2 for two moves: \n        turn9: S -> y=2 (turn10)\n        turn10: S -> y=2 (turn11) -> freeway2 at turn11: safe.\n\n  Then we are at y=2 at turn11. Then we move up from there, which takes 7 moves to y=9 -> turn18: y=9.\n\n  But let's count the turns:\n\n        turn4: D -> y=0 (turn5)\n        turn5: S -> y=0 (turn6)\n        turn6: U -> y=1 (turn7)\n        turn7: U -> y=2 (turn8)\n        turn8: S -> y=2 (turn9)\n        turn9: S -> y=2 (turn10)\n        turn10: S -> y=2 (turn11)\n        turn11: U -> y=3 (turn12) -> freeway3 at turn12: dangerous? \n                freeway3 at turn12 (dt=8): \n                    car1: [-53+48=-5,-42+48=6] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\n        So we cannot be at freeway3 at turn12.\n\n  Therefore, at turn12, we must not be at freeway3. We can be at y=2 (then freeway2) or y=3? -> but freeway3 is dangerous.\n\n  So we can do at turn11: S (stay at y=2) at turn12 -> then freeway2 at turn12: safe.\n\n  Then turn12: U -> y=3 (turn13) -> freeway3: safe (dt=9: [1,12] -> safe).\n\n  Then continue up.\n\n  Sequence:\n\n        turn4: D\n        turn5: S\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: S\n        turn9: S\n        turn10: S\n        turn11: S   -> at turn12: y=2\n        turn12: U   -> y=3 at turn13\n        turn13: U   -> y=4\n        turn14: U   -> y=5\n        turn15: U   -> y=6\n        turn16: U   -> y=7\n        turn17: U   -> y=8\n        turn18: U   -> y=9\n\n  That's 15 actions.\n\n  Same length.\n\nIs there a way to do it in fewer than 15 actions? \n\n  The direct up would be 8 actions (from y=1 to y=9: 8 ups). But we have to avoid the dangers. \n\n  The dangers force us to be at a safe freeway at turn11 and turn12. The safe freeways at turn11 and turn12 are only freeway1 and freeway2. \n\n  We are at y=1 at turn4. We can try to get to freeway2 and then wait there until turn13, then move up. \n\n  But to wait at freeway2, we need to be at y=2. \n\n  We can do:\n\n        turn4: U -> y=2 (turn5)\n        turn5: S -> y=2 (turn6) -> but freeway2 at turn6 is dangerous? \n                freeway2 at turn6 (dt=2): [48-72=-24,83-72=11] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\n        So we cannot be at freeway2 at turn6.\n\n  Therefore, at turn6 we must not be at freeway2. We can be at freeway1 or freeway3. \n\n  But freeway1 at turn6 is dangerous. Freeway3 at turn6 is safe.\n\n  So the only safe freeway at turn6 is freeway3. \n\n  Therefore, we must be at y=3 at turn6. \n\n  Then we are forced to go down to y=2 or y=1 at turn7, and then wait until turn13 to move up.\n\n  This forces at least the 15 actions.\n\n  Alternatively, we could go up to y=3 at turn6, then at turn6 we go up again to y=4 at turn7? and then continue up to as high as possible before turn11, but then at turn11 we have to be at y=1 or 2. \n\n  How to get from y=4 (or higher) to y=1 or 2 in the fewest moves? \n\n  We are at turn7: y=4. We have 4 moves (turn7,8,9,10) to get to y=1 or 2. \n\n  We can do: \n        turn7: D -> y=3\n        turn8: D -> y=2\n        turn9: D -> y=1\n        turn10: S -> y=1\n\n        Then at turn11: y=1 -> safe.\n\n        Then from turn11: \n             turn11: U -> y=2 (turn12) -> safe.\n             turn12: U -> y=3 (turn13) -> safe.\n             ... and so on to y=9 at turn19.\n\n        Actions: \n            turn4: U (y=2 at5)\n            turn5: U (y=3 at6)\n            turn6: U (y=4 at7)\n            turn7: D (y=3 at8)\n            turn8: D (y=2 at9)\n            turn9: D (y=1 at10)\n            turn10: S (y=1 at11)\n            turn11: U (y=2 at12)\n            turn12: U (y=3 at13)\n            turn13: U (y=4 at14)\n            turn14: U (y=5 at15)\n            turn15: U (y=6 at16)\n            turn16: U (y=7 at17)\n            turn17: U (y=8 at18)\n            turn18: U (y=9 at19)\n\n        Still 15 actions.\n\n  So it seems 15 is the best.\n\nBut note: in the initial two moves, we did:\n\n        turn4: U (to y=2)\n        turn5: U (to y=3)\n\n  and then at turn6 we are at y=3. \n\n  What if we do:\n\n        turn4: S (stay at y=1)\n        turn5: U (to y=2)   [at turn6: y=2? but freeway2 at turn6 is dangerous]\n\n  So that doesn't work.\n\n  What if turn4: D (to y=0) and then turn5: U (to y=1) -> then at turn6: y=1 -> freeway1 at turn6: dangerous.\n\n  So we must not be at freeway1 or freeway2 at turn6. \n\n  Therefore, we must be at y>=3 or y=0 at turn6. \n\n  But if we are at y=0 at turn6, then we are safe. But then we have to move up. \n\n  We can do:\n\n        turn4: D -> y=0 (turn5)\n        turn5: U -> y=1 (turn6) -> dangerous? freeway1 at turn6: dangerous -> not allowed.\n\n        turn4: D -> y=0 (turn5)\n        turn5: S -> y=0 (turn6) -> safe.\n        turn6: U -> y=1 (turn7) -> freeway1 at turn7: safe (dt=3: [48-108=-60,83-108=-25])\n\n        then we can continue as in the previous plan.\n\n  But then we are at y=1 at turn7. We have 4 moves to turn11: \n        turn7: U -> y=2 (turn8) -> freeway2 safe (dt=4: [48-144=-96,83-144=-61])\n        turn8: U -> y=3 (turn9) -> freeway3 safe (dt=5: [-23,-12], [55,66], [19,30])\n        turn9: U -> y=4 (turn10) -> freeway4 safe (dt=6: [-17,-6], [61,72], [25,36])\n        turn10: U -> y=5 (turn11) -> freeway5 dangerous (dt=7: [-11,0])\n\n  So not safe.\n\n  We can stop at y=4 at turn10: \n        turn10: S -> y=4 (turn11) -> freeway4 at turn11: dangerous (car1: [-11,0]).\n\n  Or at turn10: D -> y=3 (turn11) -> freeway3 at turn11: dangerous.\n\n  So we must be at y<=2 at turn11. \n\n  We are at turn8: y=2. Then we can do:\n\n        turn8: S (y=2 at turn9)\n        turn9: S (y=2 at turn10)\n        turn10: S (y=2 at turn11) -> freeway2 safe.\n\n  Then from turn11: same as before.\n\n  Sequence:\n\n        turn4: D -> y=0 (5)\n        turn5: S -> y=0 (6)\n        turn6: U -> y=1 (7)\n        turn7: U -> y=2 (8)\n        turn8: S -> y=2 (9)\n        turn9: S -> y=2 (10)\n        turn10: S -> y=2 (11)\n        turn11: U -> y=3 (12) -> dangerous? freeway3 at turn12 (dt=8) is dangerous.\n        so we do:\n        turn11: S -> y=2 (12) -> safe.\n        turn12: U -> y=3 (13) -> safe.\n        then up: turn13:U->4, 14:U->5, 15:U->6, 16:U->7, 17:U->8, 18:U->9.\n\n  That's 15 actions: \n        turns: 4 to 18 -> 15 actions.\n\n  So it seems we cannot do better than 15.\n\nTherefore, we choose the first plan we thought of:\n\n  turn4: U (to y=2)\n  turn5: U (to y=3)\n  turn6: D (to y=2)\n  turn7: S (y=2)\n  turn8: S (y=2)\n  turn9: S (y=2)\n  turn10: S (y=2)\n  turn11: S (y=2)\n  turn12: U (y=3)\n  turn13: U (y=4)\n  turn14: U (y=5)\n  turn15: U (y=6)\n  turn16: U (y=7)\n  turn17: U (y=8)\n  turn18: U (y=9)\n\nBut we must verify collision at every turn:\n\n  turn4: y=1 -> freeway1: at dt=0: [48,83] -> safe.\n  turn5: y=2 -> freeway2: at dt=1: [12,47] -> safe.\n  turn6: y=3 -> freeway3: at dt=2: \n        car1: [-41,-30] -> safe.\n        car2: [37,48] -> safe.\n        car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n  turn7: y=2 -> freeway2: at dt=3: [-60,-25] -> safe.\n  turn8: y=2 -> freeway2: at dt=4: [-96,-61] -> safe.\n  turn9: y=2 -> freeway2: at dt=5: [48-180=-132, 83-180=-97] -> safe.\n  turn10: y=2 -> freeway2: at dt=6: [48-216=-168,83-216=-133] -> safe.\n  turn11: y=2 -> freeway2: at dt=7: [48-252=-204,83-252=-169] -> safe.\n  turn12: y=2 -> freeway2: at dt=8: [48-288=-240,83-288=-205] -> safe.\n  turn13: y=3 -> freeway3: at dt=9: \n        car1: [-53+54=1, -42+54=12] -> safe (0 not included).\n        car2: [25+54=79,36+54=90] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+54=43,0+54=54] -> safe.\n  turn14: y=4 -> freeway4: at dt=10: \n        car1: [-53+60=7, -42+60=18] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+60=85,36+60=96] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+60=49,0+60=60] -> safe.\n  turn15: y=5 -> freeway5: at dt=11: \n        car: [-53+66=13, -42+66=24] -> safe.\n  turn16: y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 -> safe.\n  turn17: y=7 -> freeway7: same -> safe.\n  turn18: y=8 -> freeway8: at dt=14: \n        [-53+84=31, -42+84=42] -> safe.\n  turn19: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 15.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn4 to turn18 (H=15) is:\n\n  turn4: U\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: D\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: S\n  turn10: S\n  turn11: S\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n\nBut note: at turn18, we do the last action and then at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: D\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nWe have 15 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 14 actions? \n\n  We would then reach y=9 at turn18 (because 4+14 = 18). \n\n  That means we need to be at y=9 at turn18. \n\n  How many moves from y=1 to y=9? 8 moves. But we have 14 actions, which means 14 moves? \n\n  Actually, we have 14 actions: from turn4 to turn17 (because the last action is at turn17, and then at turn18 we are at y=9). \n\n  So we would have to move up 8 times and do 6 other moves (like down or stay). \n\n  But we have to avoid the dangers. In particular, we must be at a safe freeway at turn11 and turn12. \n\n  To be at a safe freeway at turn11, we must be at y=0,1,2. \n\n  From turn4 to turn11: we have 7 actions (turn4 to turn10) that determine the state at turn11. \n\n  We start at y=1 at turn4. \n\n  To get to y=0,1,2 at turn11, we cannot have gone up more than 1 net? \n\n  But we start at y=1. \n\n  Let u be the number of U, d for D, s for S from turn4 to turn10 (7 actions). \n\n  Then y11 = 1 + (u - d). \n\n  We require: 0<= y11 <=2. \n\n  Also, we have u+d+s=7, and we can only move so much. \n\n  Then from turn11 to turn17: 6 actions. \n\n  We need to get from y11 to 9: which requires at least 9 - y11 moves of U. \n\n  Since we can only do 6 moves, we require: 9 - y11 <= 6 -> y11 >= 3. \n\n  But we require y11<=2. Contradiction. \n\n  Therefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at turn18 (with 14 actions) because we cannot get from y11 (<=2) to y=9 in 6 moves. \n\n  Hence, 15 is indeed the minimal.\n\nSo the answer is the 15-action sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 15. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any dangerous freeway at critical turns, particularly turns 6, 11, and 12, where cars cover position 0.\n\n- **Turn 4**: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 1 at turn 4 is clear).\n- **Turn 5**: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 2 at turn 5 is clear).\n- **Turn 6**: Move down to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 3 at turn 6 is clear).\n- **Turns 7–11**: Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 remains clear through turn 12).\n- **Turn 12**: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 at turn 13 is clear after danger periods).\n- **Turns 13–18**: Move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19, as all freeways from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe after turn 12.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19 (i.e., after 15 actions starting from turn 4).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t1=5 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, with y always between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn T. When moving to a new y, the player isn't on the new row until the next turn, so I don't have to worry about cars on the destination row during the move turn.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k (which I assume is y=k) at turn t1=5. I need to model where the cars are at future turns based on their movement.\n\nLet me denote the time since t1 as τ. So at time T = t1 + τ, with τ >= 0.\n\nFor each car, the span at T is:\n\n- If left-moving (d=left), span = [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ]? No, let's look back.\n\nThe head and tail are given at t1. For left-moving, at T, it's [h - s*(T - t1), τ - s*(T - t1)] but tail is τ? In the table, it's written as (head h, tail τ), so I think τ is the tail, but in math, τ is often time, so to avoid confusion, I'll use \"tail\" or just call it t.\n\nIn the car state, for example, freeway 1: (12, 47, left, 36). Head=12, tail=47? But if it's left-moving, and head is less than tail? That might not make sense.\n\nLeft-moving cars move left, so if head is at a smaller x, tail at larger x? No, typically for left-moving, head is on the left, so x_head < x_tail, but as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving: from head to tail, and head decreases as it moves left.\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 1: head=12, tail=47? 12 to 47, that's increasing x, but direction is left, which is decreasing x. That seems inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Let's see the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut if h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, if it's moving left, h should be the front, so if moving left, decreasing x, then at t1, if [h, τ], with h < τ, then as it moves left, both decrease, so [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], which would still have h - sΔT < τ - sΔT, so the span is from smaller to larger x? But if it's moving left, the front should be at smaller x.\n\nI think there's a confusion in notation. Let me think carefully.\n\nTypically, for a car, the span is a set of positions it occupies. For left-moving, if it's moving left, at time t, its position might be from x to x+L, but as it moves, x decreases.\n\nIn this notation, \"head\" and \"tail\" might refer to the ends relative to direction.\n\nFor left-moving, \"head\" is the front, which is left-most point, and \"tail\" is the rear, right-most point? Let's see the example.\n\nIn freeway 3, there is a car: (6, -5, right, 6). Head=6, tail=-5? That can't be right because -5 < 6, but direction right.\n\nDirection right: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]? Look at the rule.\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 6), but -36 > -47, so if [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? But it's written as (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, (h, τ) with h and τ.\n\nI think the notation in the car state is (head, tail, direction, speed), but for direction, the head and tail are defined.\n\nFor left-moving: direction left, so head is left end, tail is right end, so at t1, positions from head to tail, with head < tail if x increases.\n\nBut when it moves left, both positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: direction right, head is right end, tail is left end, so at t1, from tail to head, tail < head, and as it moves right, both increase.\n\nIn the span rule:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] meaning from h to τ, so if h and τ, with h < τ for left-moving? In freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, so [12,47], and since left-moving, moving left, so at T, [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT].\n\nBut 12 to 47, with 12<47, so it's from x=12 to x=47, and moving left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] , so for example, freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,6), but h=-36, τ=-47? τ=-47, h=-36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36], and since right-moving, moving right, at T, [-47 + sΔT, -36 + sΔT].\n\nAnother car: (42,31,right,6), h=42, τ=31, so [τ, h] = [31,42], moving right to [31+ sΔT, 42+ sΔT].\n\nAnd (6,-5,right,6), h=6, τ=-5, [τ,h] = [-5,6], moving right to [-5 + sΔT, 6 + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, all have h < τ, I think, from the data.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2: (12,47,left,36), h=12, τ=47, 12<47.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8: (-36,-47,right,6), but for right-moving, it's (head, tail) with head being the front, so for right-moving, front is right, so h should be larger, but here h=-36, τ=-47, since -36 > -47, so τ=-47, h=-36, so [τ,h] = [-47,-36], which is correct for positions.\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so for direction, head is the leading end.\n\nFor left, head is left (smaller x), tail is right (larger x).\n\nFor right, head is right (larger x), tail is left (smaller x).\n\nIn the span, for left, [h, τ] from min to max, for right, [τ, h] from min to max? No, in the rule, for left, [h, τ] and h and τ are numbers, with h < τ typically for left, but not necessarily, but in this case, from data.\n\nFor freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,6), h=-36, τ=-47, so since right, [τ, h] = [-47, -36], which is from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, (42,31,right,6), h=42, τ=31, so [τ,h] = [31,42].\n\n(6,-5,right,6), h=6, τ=-5, [τ,h] = [-5,6].\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, player is at some y, and for that freeway, at that T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nPlayer position is (0, y_T), so x=0 always, we only care about x=0 for collision.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to check if x=0 is within any car's span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nIf not, it's safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, if player moves from y to y', at turn T, player is on y, so collision depends on cars on y at T. At turn T+1, player is on y', so depends on cars on y' at T+1.\n\nThe move action is applied at turn T, so position at T+1 is y + Δy based on a_T.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player position is (0, y_t).\n\nAction a_t is chosen, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t, so for collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the cars on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nWhen we say \"at turn T\", it means the state at the beginning of turn T or during?\n\nFrom the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, we evaluate based on y_T and the car spans at time T.\n\nWhen player moves, at turn T, after choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T before the move? Let's see.\n\nThe player update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at time t, position is y_t, action a_t determines Δy_t for the move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at time t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and cars at T.\n\nSo for example, at turn T, if player is on row y, and 0 is in some car span on row y at time T, collision occurs.\n\nIf player moves to a new row, at turn T, they are still on the old row, so only cars on old row matter at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, they are on the new row, so cars on new row at T+1 matter.\n\nThe note confirms: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from cars on y_{T+1} at T.\n\nOnly at T+1 if you are on it.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9 as soon as possible, starting from y=2 at t1=5.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are freeways y=1 to 8, but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways? The grid is y=0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"freeways y = 1, …, 8\" so only those have cars. y=0 and y=9 should have no cars, so safe to be on.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, which is a freeway with cars.\n\nt1=5, position (0,2).\n\nWe need to go to (0,9).\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nMinimize number of turns H, so sequence of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and y_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nt1=5, so turns from 5 to 5+H-1, with y_{5+H-1} =9.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t1, so at time τ, actual turn is t1 + τ.\n\nPlayer position at time τ: y(τ)\n\nStart: τ=0, y(0) =2\n\nAfter H turns, at time τ=H, y(H) should be 9? Let's see the indices.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position.\n\nAt t = t1, y_{t1} =2\n\nAfter one action, at t=t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet k from 0 to H-1, action at t = t1 + k, for k=0 to H-1.\n\nThen position after H actions: at turn t = t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} is set based on a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position is y_{t1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen the actions are from t1 to t1 + H-1, total H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t1, then y_{t1} should be 9, but it's 2, not possible with one action since |Δy|<=1.\n\nMinimum H: from y=2 to y=9, need at least 7 steps up, but can go down or stay, so minimum possible H is 7 if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time for each freeway.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\nCar states at t1=5.\n\nI'll denote ΔT = T - t1, so for time T, relative time τ = T - t1.\n\nAt τ=0, t=5.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head=12, tail=47, left, speed=36)\n\nSince left-moving, span at time τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] but tail is τ? In notation, tail is the other end.\n\nLet's use head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving: span at τ: [head - s τ, tail - s τ]\n\nSince head and tail are both decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [tail + s τ, head + s τ] because for right, span at τ: [τ + s τ, h + s τ]? From rule.\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] but τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSo [tail + s τ, head + s τ] where τ is time offset.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use δ for time offset from t1.\n\nAt time δ (relative), actual turn t = 5 + δ.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1): car: head=12, tail=47, dir=left, s=36\n\nSpan at time δ: [12 - 36δ, 47 - 36δ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [12-36δ, 47-36δ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): same as freeway 1? (12,47,left,36), identical to y=1.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): three cars.\n\nFirst car: (head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, s=6)  // head=-36, tail=-47? tail=-47, head=-36\n\nFor right-moving, span: [tail + s δ, head + s δ] = [-47 + 6δ, -36 + 6δ]\n\nSecond car: (head=42, tail=31, dir=right, s=6) // head=42, tail=31, so [31 + 6δ, 42 + 6δ]\n\nThird car: (head=6, tail=-5, dir=right, s=6) // head=6, tail=-5, so [-5 + 6δ, 6 + 6δ]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): same as y=3: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): only one car: (-36,-47,right,6) so [ -47 + 6δ, -36 + 6δ ]\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): same\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same\n\nNow, for each freeway and each time δ, I need to know if x=0 is occupied, i.e., if 0 is in any car's span on that row at that time.\n\nSince player is always at x=0, collision if for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor a given y and δ, if there is a car on y with span such that 0 between low and high.\n\nThen, for player to be safe at position y at time δ, we need that for freeway y, at time δ, 0 is not in any car span on that row.\n\nSince only one row matters at a time for collision.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at δ=0.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions: U, D, S, to change y, so that at each step, when at position y(δ) at time δ, it is safe, and finally at some δ, y(δ) =9.\n\nδ starts from 0.\n\nAt time δ, position y(δ), action a_δ determines y(δ+1).\n\nWe want to reach y(δ) =9 for some δ, with minimal δ.\n\nSince we start at δ=0, y=2, and we want to reach y=9, the minimal possible δ is 7 if we go up every time, but may have collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which times it is unsafe, i.e., collision at x=0.\n\nSince the cars move, we can find for each row, the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nStart with y=1.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car, left-moving, span [12 - 36δ, 47 - 36δ]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36δ <= 0 <= 47 - 36δ\n\nWhich is 12 - 36δ <= 0 and 0 <= 47 - 36δ\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36δ <= 0 => 12 <= 36δ => δ >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36δ => 36δ <= 47 => δ <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for δ in [1/3, 47/36], unsafe.\n\nδ >= 1/3 and δ <= 47/36, so unsafe when ceil(1/3) to floor(47/36)? δ is integer? Time δ is in terms of turns, so δ integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nTurns are discrete, so δ = 0,1,2,3,... integer.\n\nδ >= 1/3 ≈ 0.333, so δ >= 1 since δ integer.\n\nδ <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056, so δ <= 1.\n\nThus for δ=1, unsafe.\n\nFor δ=0: 12 - 0 =12 >0? At δ=0, span [12,47], 0 not in [12,47], since 12>0, so safe.\n\nδ=1: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11], -24 <=0<=11? 0 is between -24 and 11, yes, so unsafe.\n\nδ=2: [12-72,47-72] = [-60,-25], -60<=0<=-25? 0 > -25? -25 <0, so 0 not <= -25, not in span. Since min=-60, max=-25, both negative, 0 not in between.\n\nSimilarly for higher δ, more negative, safe.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe only at δ=1.\n\nNow y=2: same as y=1, car (12,47,left,36), so identical, unsafe only at δ=1.\n\nNow y=3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=-36, t=-47, right, s=6) so span [t + sδ, h + sδ] = [-47 +6δ, -36 +6δ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +6δ <= 0 <= -36 +6δ\n\nFirst: -47 +6δ <=0 => 6δ <=47 => δ <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6δ => 6δ >=36 => δ >=6\n\nSo for δ from 6 to 7.833, unsafe when δ integer, δ=6,7.\n\nδ>=6 and δ<=7 since δ=7: -36+42=6>0? Let's compute:\n\nAt δ=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], -11<=0<=0, yes 0<=0, so included, unsafe.\n\nδ=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nδ=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 1>0, not <=0? min=1, max=12, 0 < min, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, δ=5: [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at δ=6 and 7.\n\nSecond car on y=3: (h=42, t=31, right, s=6), span [t + sδ, h + sδ] = [31 +6δ, 42 +6δ]\n\n0 in span? 31+6δ <=0 <=42+6δ? But 31+6δ >=31>0 for δ>=0, so min >=31>0, 0 not in, always safe for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (h=6, t=-5, right, s=6), span [t + sδ, h + sδ] = [-5 +6δ, 6 +6δ]\n\n0 in span if -5+6δ <=0 <=6+6δ\n\nFirst: -5+6δ <=0 => 6δ <=5 => δ <=5/6≈0.833\n\nSecond: 0 <=6+6δ always true since 6+6δ >=6>0 for δ>=0.\n\nSo only first inequality, δ <=5/6, since δ integer >=0, δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0: [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nδ=1: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo unsafe only at δ=0 for this car.\n\nTherefore, for y=3, at each time δ, unsafe if any car has collision.\n\nAt δ=0: third car has collision, so unsafe.\n\nAt δ=1: no car has collision? First car: at δ=1, [-47+6, -36+6]=[-41,-30], not 0. Second car: [31+6,42+6]=[37,48], not. Third car: [1,12], not. So safe at δ=1.\n\nAt δ=2: similar, all min positive or negative, not 0.\n\nAt δ=6: first car unsafe, second and third safe? Second car [31+36,42+36]=[67,78] no, third [ -5+12,6+12]=[7,18] no, but first car unsafe, so overall unsafe.\n\nSimilarly δ=7: first car unsafe.\n\nSo for y=3, unsafe at δ=0,6,7.\n\nNow y=4: same cars as y=3, so identical to y=3, unsafe at δ=0,6,7.\n\ny=5: only one car: (-36,-47,right,6) same as first car on y=3, so span [-47+6δ, -36+6δ]\n\nUnsafe when -47+6δ <=0 <= -36+6δ\n\nAs before, δ>=6 and δ<=7.833, so δ=6,7.\n\nAt δ=6: [-11,0], unsafe; δ=7: [-5,6], unsafe.\n\nOther times safe.\n\ny=6: same as y=5, unsafe at δ=6,7.\n\ny=7: same, unsafe at δ=6,7.\n\ny=8: same, unsafe at δ=6,7.\n\nNow y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at δ=0: we said for y=2, unsafe only at δ=1, at δ=0 safe? Earlier for y=2, at δ=0, span [12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut for y=3 at δ=0 unsafe, but player is not on y=3 at δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0, position y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nThe unsafe times:\n\nLet me summarize for each y and δ, if it is safe (no collision) or unsafe.\n\nδ integer from 0 up.\n\ny=1: safe except δ=1\n\ny=2: safe except δ=1\n\ny=3: safe except δ=0,6,7\n\ny=4: safe except δ=0,6,7\n\ny=5: safe except δ=6,7\n\ny=6: safe except δ=6,7\n\ny=7: safe except δ=6,7\n\ny=8: safe except δ=6,7\n\ny=0: always safe\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nPlayer must be at a safe position at each time δ.\n\nStart at δ=0, y=2.\n\nAt δ=0, y=2 is safe, as above.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S, changing y by +1,-1,0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nMinimal steps: if no obstacles, go up 7 times, from 2 to 9 in 7 steps.\n\nBut with collisions, we need to avoid being on unsafe positions at the wrong time.\n\nSpecifically, at each time δ, whatever y(δ) is, it must be safe for that δ.\n\nAlso, when moving, the action affects y(δ+1).\n\nLet me list the sequence.\n\nDenote y(δ) for δ=0,1,2,...\n\nStart δ=0, y(0)=2\n\nAfter action a_δ, y(δ+1) = y(δ) + Δy, with Δy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nWe want y(δ) =9 for some δ, minimal δ.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always, we can stay there.\n\nBut we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, can we go straight up?\n\nSuppose we do U every time.\n\ny(0)=2\n\na_0: U, y(1) = 3\n\nBut at δ=1, y(1)=3\n\nNow, for y=3 at δ=1: earlier we said y=3 is safe at δ=1? Yes, from above, y=3 unsafe at δ=0,6,7, so at δ=1, safe.\n\nThen a_1: U, y(2)=4\n\ny=4 at δ=2: safe, since unsafe only δ=0,6,7.\n\nδ=2 not in, safe.\n\na_2: U, y(3)=5\n\ny=5 at δ=3: y=5 unsafe only at δ=6,7, δ=3 safe.\n\na_3: U, y(4)=6\n\ny=6 at δ=4: unsafe at δ=6,7, δ=4 safe.\n\na_4: U, y(5)=7\n\ny=7 at δ=5: unsafe at δ=6,7, δ=5 <6, safe.\n\na_5: U, y(6)=8\n\ny=8 at δ=6: but y=8 unsafe at δ=6,7! Oh, at δ=6, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\ny(6)=8 at δ=6, and y=8 unsafe at δ=6.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf we continue to a_5: U to y(6)=8, but at δ=6, position y=8, and unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter a_4: U to y(5)=7 at δ=5, which is safe.\n\nThen instead of U, we could do something else.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nAt δ=5, y(5)=7, safe.\n\nIf we do S: a_5=S, y(6)=7, still on y=7 at δ=6.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at δ=6, so collision.\n\nIf we do D: a_5=D, y(6)=6, y=6 at δ=6, unsafe.\n\ny=6 also unsafe at δ=6.\n\nOr U to y(6)=8, unsafe.\n\nSo at δ=5, if we are on y=7, and δ=6 is coming, all adjacent rows y=6,7,8 are unsafe at δ=6.\n\ny=6,7,8 all unsafe at δ=6 and 7.\n\ny=5 is also unsafe at δ=6,7.\n\nBut y=4: at δ=6, y=4 unsafe? y=4 unsafe at δ=6,7? Earlier y=4 same as y=3, unsafe at δ=0,6,7.\n\ny=4 unsafe at δ=6.\n\nSimilarly y=3 unsafe at δ=6.\n\ny=2: at δ=6, y=2 is safe except δ=1, so at δ=6, safe.\n\ny=1: safe except δ=1, so safe at δ=6.\n\ny=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at δ=5, if we are on y=7, we can only go to y=6,7,8, all unsafe at next time if we stay or move.\n\nBut at δ=5, we are at y=7, which is safe only if we can move to a safe position at δ=6.\n\nBut from y=7, possible next positions: if a_5=U, y(6)=8, unsafe at δ=6.\n\na_5=D, y(6)=6, unsafe.\n\na_5=S, y(6)=7, unsafe.\n\nAll lead to unsafe at δ=6.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=7 at δ=5, because it forces us to be on unsafe row at δ=6.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid being on rows that require us to be unsafe later.\n\nBut in this case, for the straight up path, we are stuck at δ=5.\n\nBut we started from lower.\n\nPerhaps we need to go up slower or down to avoid the critical times.\n\nSince δ=6 and 7 are unsafe for many rows, we should not be on y=3 to 8 at δ=6 or 7.\n\ny=3 to 8 all unsafe at δ=6,7.\n\ny=1 and y=2 safe at those times.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, the critical period is δ=6 and 7.\n\nWe need to be on safe rows during that time.\n\nPossible safe rows at δ=6 and 7: y=0,1,2,9.\n\ny=9 is the target.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nAt δ=0, y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal δ to reach y=9 is 7, but at δ=6 and 7, if we are on the way, we might be caught.\n\nSince δ=6 and 7 are problematic, we can delay our progress so that we pass the critical rows before δ=6 or after δ=7.\n\nFor example, go up to y=9 before δ=6.\n\nδ=0: y=2\n\nAfter k steps, y=2 + number of U minus number of D.\n\nTo reach y=9, need net +7 up.\n\nMinimal steps 7 if all U.\n\nBut from δ=0 to δ=5, we have 6 steps? Let's see the time.\n\nAt δ=0, position before action.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y(0)=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, at δ=1, y(1)\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at δ=H, y(H)\n\nWe want y(δ) =9 for some δ.\n\nFor minimal δ, since we start at y=2, δ=0, we can reach at earliest δ=7 with all U.\n\nBut at δ=7, if we are at y=9, it is safe, but to get there at δ=7, we need y(7)=9.\n\ny(7) is position at time δ=7.\n\nTo have y(7)=9, we must have performed actions from δ=0 to δ=6, 7 actions, to increase y by 7.\n\ny(δ) at time δ.\n\ny(0) =2\n\nAfter first action at δ=0, y(1) = y(0) + Δy_0\n\n...\n\ny(δ) = y(0) + sum_{k=0}^{δ-1} Δy_k\n\nWe want y(δ) =9 for some δ.\n\nSince y(0)=2, we need sum_{k=0}^{δ-1} Δy_k =7\n\nEach Δy_k in {-1,0,1}\n\nMinimal δ when sum=7, which requires all Δy_k=1 for k=0 to 6, so y(7)=2+7=9.\n\nThus earliest possible is δ=7, with y(7)=9.\n\nAt δ=7, y=9, safe.\n\nBut to achieve that, we need to be at positions during the path.\n\nSpecifically, for each intermediate time, y(τ) for τ=0 to 6 must be safe.\n\nIn this case, with all U:\n\ny(0)=2, safe\n\ny(1)=3, at δ=1: y=3 unsafe? At δ=1, y=3 is safe, as we said earlier, unsafe only at 0,6,7, so δ=1 safe.\n\ny(2)=4, δ=2 safe\n\ny(3)=5, δ=3 safe\n\ny(4)=6, δ=4 safe\n\ny(5)=7, δ=5 safe\n\ny(6)=8, δ=6: y=8 unsafe at δ=6! Problem at y(6)=8, δ=6.\n\ny(6) is at time δ=6, which is unsafe for y=8.\n\nThen y(7)=9, safe, but at δ=6 we have collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 earlier, but impossible since min steps 7.\n\nPerhaps with some down or stay, but that would take more time, so δ>7.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=9 at δ=8, then we have more flexibility.\n\nBut minimal H might be larger.\n\nSince at δ=6 and 7, we need to be on safe rows: y=0,1,2,9.\n\nIf we can be on y=2 or y=1 at δ=6 and 7, then after δ=7, we can go up.\n\ny=9 is also safe.\n\nBut we need to reach there.\n\nFirst, let's list the safe positions over time.\n\nFor each δ, which y are safe.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt δ=0: y=0 safe, y=1 safe (since unsafe only δ=1), y=2 safe, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=5 safe? y=5 unsafe only δ=6,7, so at δ=0 safe, similarly y=6,7,8 safe at δ=0, y=9 safe.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0, unsafe rows: y=3 and y=4.\n\nSafe: y=0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9\n\nBut player starts at y=2, safe.\n\nAt δ=1: y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe (both at δ=1), y=3 safe (unsafe δ=0,6,7, so δ=1 safe), y=4 safe, y=5 safe, etc.\n\ny=1 unsafe at δ=1\n\ny=2 unsafe at δ=1\n\ny=3 safe at δ=1\n\ny=4 safe at δ=1\n\ny=5 safe\n\n...\n\ny=8 safe at δ=1\n\ny=0 and 9 safe.\n\nSo at δ=1, unsafe: y=1 and y=2\n\nSafe: y=0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nAt δ=2: similar, y=1 safe (only unsafe δ=1), y=2 safe, y=3 safe (unsafe 0,6,7), all others safe except possibly.\n\ny=3 unsafe δ=0,6,7 so δ=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly all rows safe at δ=2, since no critical times.\n\nExcept y=3 to 8 have unsafe at δ=6,7, but δ=2 not those.\n\nSimilarly δ=3,4,5 all safe for all rows except at δ=6,7.\n\nAt δ=3: all y safe, since for y=1,2 unsafe only δ=1; y=3,4 unsafe δ=0,6,7; y=5-8 unsafe δ=6,7; so at δ=3, all safe.\n\nSimilarly δ=4,5 same.\n\nδ=6: unsafe for y=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nSafe for y=0,1,2,9\n\nδ=7: same, unsafe y=3,4,5,6,7,8; safe y=0,1,2,9\n\nδ=8: for y=3,4 unsafe δ=6,7, so at δ=8 safe; y=5-8 unsafe δ=6,7, so safe at δ=8; all safe.\n\nSimilarly for higher δ.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 at δ=0 to y=9 at some δ.\n\nMinimal δ=7 not possible due to collision at δ=6.\n\nNext possible: δ=8.\n\nCan we reach y=9 at δ=8?\n\ny(8)=9\n\nThen sum of Δy from k=0 to 7 should be +7.\n\ny(8) = y(0) + sum_{k=0}^{7} Δy_k = 2 + sum_{k=0}^{7} Δy_k =9, so sum_{k=0}^{7} Δy_k =7\n\nSince each |Δy|<=1, we need exactly 7 U and 1 S, or 7 U and one D but that would be sum=6 if one D, not 7.\n\nsum of 8 Δy must be +7.\n\nEach Δy = +1,0,-1.\n\nSo possible with 7 U and 1 S, or 8 U and one something, but 8 actions to y(8), from k=0 to 7, 8 actions.\n\ny(δ) after δ actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt time δ, after δ actions have been taken? No.\n\nAt time δ (relative), position y(δ).\n\ny(0) before any action, at start.\n\nAfter action at δ=0, position at δ=1 is y(1) = y(0) + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action at δ, position at δ+1 is y(δ+1) = y(δ) + Δy_δ\n\nWe want y(δ) =9 for some δ.\n\nFor example, at δ=0, y=2\n\nAt δ=1, y= y(0) + Δy_0, etc.\n\nTo have y(δ) =9, with y(0)=2, so the number of U minus number of D from step 0 to δ-1 must be 7, since each U contributes +1 to y, D contributes -1, S contributes 0.\n\ny(δ) = 2 + sum_{k=0}^{δ-1} Δy_k\n\nSet equal to 9: sum_{k=0}^{δ-1} Δy_k =7\n\nThe actions from k=0 to δ-1 determine y(δ).\n\nNumber of actions is δ.\n\nFor y(δ)=9, with min δ=7, with all U.\n\nBut not possible due to collision.\n\nNow for δ=8: y(8)=9, so sum_{k=0}^{7} Δy_k =7\n\nWith 8 actions, sum=7, so must have 7 U and 1 S, or 7 U and one D but that would be sum=6, not 7, so only possibilities: 7 U and 1 S, or 8 U and negative, but no, 8 U would be sum=8>7, too much.\n\nActions: each action changes y for the next position.\n\ny(δ) = 2 + sum_{i=0}^{δ-1} Δy_i\n\nFor y(8) = 2 + sum_{i=0}^{7} Δy_i =9, so sum_{i=0}^{7} Δy_i =7\n\nSince each Δy_i <=1, to have sum=7, we need exactly 7 U and one action with Δy=0, i.e., S. Because if one D, Δy=-1, then sum <= 6*1 + (-1) + 0*6? With 8 actions, if 7 U and one D, sum=7*1 + (-1) + 0*0 =6, too low. If 8 U, sum=8>7. So only 7 U and 1 S, with the S at some point.\n\nSimilarly, for δ=9, we could have 7 U and 2 S, or 8 U and one D, etc., but that would be slower.\n\nFirst, try δ=8 with 7 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, we need the path to be safe at all times.\n\ny(τ) must be safe for τ=0 to 8, but since we reach at τ=8, and y(8)=9 safe.\n\nNow, y(0)=2, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the positions over time.\n\nThe S action will keep y constant for one step, so we delay one up move.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on unsafe positions, especially at δ=6 and 7.\n\nAt δ=6 and 7, we need to be on y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut if we are going up, y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nSince we have to insert one S, we can stay at some safe row for one turn.\n\nFor example, stay at y=2 or y=1 or y=0 at some point.\n\nBut y=0 is low.\n\nStart at δ=0, y=2 safe.\n\nNow, at δ=1, we need to choose action.\n\nIf we go U, y(1)=3, but at δ=1, y=3 is safe (since unsafe only δ=0,6,7, δ=1 safe).\n\ny(1)=3 safe.\n\nIf we go S, y(1)=2, but at δ=1, y=2 is unsafe! At δ=1, y=2 is unsafe, as per earlier.\n\ny=2 unsafe at δ=1.\n\nSo if we do S at δ=0, y(1)=2 at δ=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot do S at δ=0.\n\nIf we do D, y(1)=1, at δ=1, y=1 is also unsafe at δ=1.\n\nSo at δ=0, only possible safe action is U, to y(1)=3, which is safe at δ=1.\n\nThen at δ=1, position y(1)=3, safe.\n\nNow action at δ=1: can do U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y(2)=4\n\nAt δ=2, y=4 safe? y=4 unsafe only δ=0,6,7, δ=2 safe, so y(2)=4 safe.\n\nIf S, y(2)=3, at δ=2, y=3 safe (unsafe δ=0,6,7, δ=2 safe).\n\nIf D, y(2)=2, at δ=2, y=2 safe (only unsafe δ=1, δ=2 safe).\n\nAll possible, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nBut let's see the critical times.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 by δ=8.\n\ny(8)=9.\n\nCurrently at δ=1, y=3.\n\nNeed to increase by 6 in 7 steps? From δ=1 to δ=8, actions at δ=1 to δ=7, 7 actions.\n\ny(8) = y(1) + sum_{i=1}^{7} Δy_i =3 + sum_{i=1}^{7} Δy_i\n\nSet to 9, so sum_{i=1}^{7} Δy_i =6\n\nWith 7 actions, need net +6, so could be 6 U and 1 S, or 7 U and one D, but 7U and one D would be net +6, yes.\n\nOr 6U and one S and one something, etc.\n\nBut minimal, with one S or one D.\n\nNow, we need to handle δ=6 and 7.\n\nAt δ=6 and 7, we must be on safe rows: y=0,1,2,9.\n\nSince we are going to y=9, at δ=8, we might not be at 9 at δ=6 or 7.\n\nSimilarly, y=0,1,2 are low.\n\nSo perhaps at δ=6 and 7, we should be on y=1 or y=2.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=2 at δ=6 and δ=7.\n\ny=2 is safe at those times.\n\nThen after that, go up to 9.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps up, so from δ=7 to δ=14, but we want to reach by δ=8, so not possible if we are at y=2 at δ=7.\n\ny(7) at δ=7.\n\nIf y(7)=2, then to y(8)=9, need +7 in one step, impossible, |Δy|<=1.\n\nSo y(8) <= y(7) +1.\n\nThus if y(7) <=8, y(8) <=9.\n\nBut to reach y(8)=9, we need y(7) >=8, since if y(7)=8, U to 9; if y(7)=9, S or something.\n\nBut at δ=7, if y(7)=8, but y=8 unsafe at δ=7.\n\nSimilarly, if y(7)=9, safe.\n\nBut to have y(7)=9, we need to reach earlier.\n\nFor y(8)=9, possible with y(7)=8 and U, or y(7)=9 and S, or y(7)=10 impossible, etc.\n\nBut at δ=7, y=8 is unsafe, so we cannot have y(7)=8.\n\nIf y(7)=9, safe, then we can do S to y(8)=9.\n\nOr if y(7)=9, U to y(8)=10>9, but y must be <=9, so not allowed, y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from 9, cannot go up, only D or S.\n\nBut we want to stay or go down, but we need y=9.\n\nSo for y(7)=9, then a_7=S or D, but to have y(8)=9, if y(7)=9, a_7=S, y(8)=9.\n\nOr a_7=D, y(8)=8, then not 9.\n\nBut we want y(8)=9, so if y(7)=9, we can do S to stay at 9.\n\nIf y(7)=8, we can do U to y(8)=9, but at δ=7, y=8 unsafe, so we cannot be at y=8 at δ=7.\n\nSimilarly, if y(7)=7, U to y(8)=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y(8)=9, we must have y(7)=9 and a_7=S, or y(7)=8 and a_7=U, but y(7)=8 at δ=7 unsafe.\n\nSo the only possibility to have y(8)=9 is to have y(7)=9 and a_7=S.\n\nThen y(8)=9.\n\nAnd at δ=7, y(7)=9 safe.\n\nNow, y(7)=9 must be reached by δ=7.\n\nBut at δ=7, y=9 safe, but to be at y=9 at δ=7.\n\ny(7)=9.\n\nThen from start, y(0)=2, so in 7 steps, from δ=0 to δ=6 actions, y(7) = y(0) + sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i =2 + sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i =9, so sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i =7\n\nWith 7 actions (i=0 to 6), all must be U, no choice.\n\nBut then y(6) = y(0) + sum_{i=0}^{5} Δy_i for y(6), let's see.\n\ny(6) = 2 + sum_{i=0}^{5} Δy_i\n\nIf all U from i=0 to 6, y(6) = 2 + 6*1 =8 if first 6 U, then y(6)=8\n\nThen a_6=U, y(7)=9\n\nBut at δ=6, y(6)=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we have all U, but y(6)=8 at δ=6 unsafe.\n\nAnd we cannot avoid it with all U.\n\nIf we insert S or D, but sum must be 7 with 7 actions, so all U necessary, no other way.\n\nThus impossible to have y(7)=9 with safe path.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 at δ=7 or have it at δ=7 for the δ=8 target.\n\nFor y(8)=9, we need y(7)=9 and a_7=S.\n\nBut y(7)=9 requires reaching by δ=7, which we can't safely.\n\nPerhaps reach at δ=8 directly from y(7)=8 with U, but y(7)=8 at δ=7 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at δ=8.\n\ny(8)=9 only possible if y(7)=9 and a_7=S, or y(7)=8 and a_7=U.\n\nBut both cases require y(7) to be 8 or 9, but at δ=7, y=8 or 9, y=8 unsafe, y=9 safe but we can't reach y=9 at δ=7.\n\nSo for δ=8, cannot achieve y(8)=9.\n\nSimilarly, for later times.\n\nNext, try δ=9.\n\ny(9)=9\n\nThen sum_{i=0}^{8} Δy_i =7\n\nWith 9 actions, sum=7, so possibilities: 7 U and 2 S, or 8 U and 1 D, etc.\n\nNow, we need to be safe at all times, including avoiding δ=6 and 7 on unsafe rows.\n\nAt δ=6 and 7, we must be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\nSo likely, at δ=6 and 7, we should be on y=1 or 2.\n\nFor example, be on y=2 at δ=6 and δ=7.\n\nThen after δ=7, go up to 9.\n\nFrom δ=7, y(7)=2, then to y(9)=9, need +7 in two steps? y(9) = y(7) + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\nSet to 9, so if y(7)=2, then 2 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 =9, so Δy_7 + Δy_8 =7, impossible, |Δy|<=1, max +2.\n\nSo cannot go from 2 to 9 in two steps.\n\nIf y(7)=1, worse.\n\nIf y(7)=9, then we can stay, but we need to reach it.\n\nBut at δ=7, y=9 safe, but to reach by δ=7 not possible.\n\nSimilarly, if at δ=6, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nAt δ=7, we need to be on safe row.\n\nIf we stay on y=2, safe.\n\nThen at δ=8, we can start going up.\n\nBut from y=2 at δ=7 to y=9 at δ=9, need to go to at least y=8 at δ=8, then to 9 at δ=9.\n\ny(8) = y(7) + Δy_7\n\nIf y(7)=2, then y(8) <=3\n\nThen y(9) = y(8) + Δy_8 <=4, not 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 by δ=9 if at δ=7 we are at low y.\n\nTo reach high y quickly, we need to be higher before δ=6.\n\nFor example, at δ=5, we can be on high y, but at δ=5, what is safe.\n\nAt δ=5, all rows are safe, as earlier.\n\ny=3 to 8 unsafe only at δ=6,7, so at δ=5, all safe.\n\nSimilarly, δ=4, etc.\n\nSo at δ=5, we can be on y=8, for example.\n\nBut at δ=6, if we are on y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to move to a safe row at δ=6.\n\nFrom y at δ=5, action a_5 determines y(6).\n\nAt δ=6, we need y(6) in {0,1,2,9}\n\nSimilarly for δ=7.\n\nBut y=9 may not be reachable yet.\n\nSo possible safe havens: y=1 or y=2 at δ=6 and 7.\n\nSince y=0 is low, not helpful for going up.\n\nSo let's aim to be on y=2 at δ=6 and δ=7.\n\ny=2 is safe at those times.\n\nThen after δ=7, we can go up.\n\nFirst, from start to δ=5, we can go up to some y, say y=5 or 6 or 7.\n\nAt δ=5, y(5) can be up to, say, 7 or 8.\n\nThen from there, at δ=5, we need to move to a position so that at δ=6, we are on y=2 or 1 or 0.\n\nBut from high y, to go to low y quickly.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at δ=5, if we do D, y(6)=6, but y=6 unsafe at δ=6.\n\nIf we do D twice, but at δ=6, we are on y=6 if one D, or y=5 if two D, but both unsafe at δ=6.\n\nFrom y=7 at δ=5, to reach y=2 at δ=6, impossible in one step, |Δy|<=1, so y(6) =6,7, or 8, all unsafe at δ=6.\n\nSimilarly, from any y at δ=5, y(6) = y(5) + Δy, so if y(5) >=3, y(6) between y(5)-1 and y(5)+1, so if y(5) >=3, y(6) >=2, but y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8, at δ=6, only y=2 is safe among these, but y=2 is safe, but y(6)=2 only if y(5)=2 or 3 with D.\n\nIf y(5)=2, then y(6) can be 1,2,3.\n\nAt δ=6, safe only if y(6)=2 (since y=1 safe? y=1 safe at δ=6, yes, as well as y=2.\n\ny=1 safe at δ=6, y=2 safe.\n\ny=3 unsafe.\n\nSo if y(5)=2, then at δ=5, position, we can do S, y(6)=2 safe; or U, y(6)=3 unsafe; or D, y(6)=1 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if y(5)=1, then y(6) can be 0,1,2, all safe at δ=6.\n\nBut y=1 at δ=5 is safe, since unsafe only at δ=1.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nWe need to reach a point where at δ=5, we can be at a low y to stay safe during δ=6 and 7.\n\nBut we also need to go up to 9 later.\n\nLet's plan the path step by step.\n\nStart: δ=0, y=2 safe.\n\nAction a0: only safe choice is U, to y(1)=3, because if S or D, y(1)=2 or 1, both unsafe at δ=1.\n\nAt δ=1, y=1 and y=2 unsafe, so we must not be on them at δ=1.\n\nSo at δ=0, only possible action is U, to y(1)=3, which is safe at δ=1.\n\nSo y(1)=3.\n\nNow at δ=1, y=3 safe.\n\nAction a1: can do U, to y(2)=4\n\nOr S, to y(2)=3\n\nOr D, to y(2)=2\n\nAll safe at δ=2, since at δ=2, all rows safe.\n\nWe need to go up, so probably U or S, not D.\n\nBut we can choose.\n\nNow, we need to handle δ=6 and 7 later.\n\nLet's go to higher y first.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible before δ=6.\n\nFor example, from here, do U at each step until δ=5.\n\nAt δ=1, a1=U, y(2)=4\n\nδ=2, a2=U, y(3)=5\n\nδ=3, a3=U, y(4)=6\n\nδ=4, a4=U, y(5)=7\n\nNow at δ=5, y=7, safe.\n\nNow action a5: we need to choose so that y(6) is safe at δ=6.\n\nAt δ=6, safe rows: y=0,1,2,9\n\nBut y=9 not reached, so y=0,1,2.\n\nFrom y=7, possible actions:\n\na5=U: y(6)=8, unsafe at δ=6\n\na5=S: y(6)=7, unsafe\n\na5=D: y(6)=6, unsafe\n\nAll unsafe! No choice, all lead to unsafe y(6).\n\nStuck.\n\nInstead, at some point, we go down to lower y.\n\nFor example, at δ=1, y=3, instead of U, we do D.\n\na1=D, then y(2)=2\n\nAt δ=2, y=2 safe.\n\nThen from here, we can go up or down.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt δ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nAction a2: U to y(3)=3, or S to y(3)=2, or D to y(3)=1\n\nAll safe at δ=3.\n\nNow, if we go up, we might be high at δ=5.\n\nBut at δ=5, if we are on y=2, for example.\n\nSet y(5)=2.\n\nThen at δ=5, y=2 safe.\n\nThen action a5: to go to safe at δ=6, we can do S to y(6)=2, or D to y(6)=1, or U to y(6)=3 but unsafe.\n\nSo do S or D.\n\nSay a5=S, y(6)=2, safe at δ=6.\n\nThen at δ=6, y=2, safe.\n\nAction a6: similarly, at δ=7, we need safe row, so can do S to y(7)=2, or D to y(7)=1, or U to y(7)=3 unsafe.\n\nSo do S or D.\n\nSay a6=S, y(7)=2, safe at δ=7.\n\nThen after that, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt δ=7, y=2.\n\nThen to reach y=9, need at least 7 steps, so at earliest δ=14.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we are higher before.\n\nBut at δ=5, we could be higher than 2.\n\nFor example, from start.\n\nδ=0: y=2, a0=U, y(1)=3\n\nδ=1: y=3, instead of U, do S, a1=S, y(2)=3\n\nAt δ=2, y=3 safe.\n\nThen a2=U, y(3)=4\n\na3=U, y(4)=5\n\na4=U, y(5)=6\n\nAt δ=5, y=6, safe.\n\nBut then at a4=U to y(5)=6, safe at δ=5.\n\nNow, from y=6 at δ=5, we need to get to safe row at δ=6.\n\nBut from y=6, y(6) can be 5,6,7, all unsafe at δ=6.\n\nNo way.\n\nDo D at some point.\n\nFor example, at δ=1, y=3, a1=D, y(2)=2\n\nδ=2, y=2, a2=U, y(3)=3\n\nδ=3, y=3, a3=U, y(4)=4\n\nδ=4, y=4, a4=U, y(5)=5\n\nAt δ=5, y=5, safe.\n\nSame problem, from y=5, y(6) =4,5,6, all unsafe at δ=6.\n\nIf at δ=4, we do D.\n\nδ=3, y=3, a3=D, y(4)=2\n\nδ=4, y=2, safe.\n\na4=U, y(5)=3\n\nδ=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a5: to go to safe at δ=6, y(6) must be 0,1,2.\n\nFrom y=3, a5=D, y(6)=2 safe; or a5=S, y(6)=3 unsafe; a5=U, y(6)=4 unsafe.\n\nSo a5=D, y(6)=2, safe at δ=6.\n\nThen at δ=6, y=2, safe.\n\na6: to be safe at δ=7, similarly, a6=S, y(7)=2 or a6=D, y(7)=1, both safe; a6=U, y(7)=3 unsafe.\n\nSo say a6=S, y(7)=2, safe.\n\nNow at δ=7, y=2.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at δ=7, to y(9)=9, for example.\n\ny(9) = y(7) + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\n2 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 =9, so Δy_7 + Δy_8 =7, impossible.\n\nSo we need to reach later.\n\nFor example, at δ=10 or something.\n\nBut let's find minimal H.\n\nSince we have to spend δ=6 and 7 on low rows, we should be on low rows during that time and go up before or after.\n\nBut before δ=6, we can go up to some point, but not too high.\n\nFor example, at δ=5, be on y=2, as above.\n\nThen from δ=0 to δ=5, we have 5 actions, from y=2 to y(5), with sum of 5 Δy.\n\ny(5) = 2 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i\n\nIn the sequence above, we had y(5)=3, for example.\n\nIn the last sequence: δ=0: y=2, a0=U, y(1)=3\n\nδ=1: a1=D, y(2)=2\n\nδ=2: a2=U, y(3)=3\n\nδ=3: a3=U, y(4)=4? Let's list:\n\nδ=0: y=2\n\na0=U, y(1)=3\n\nδ=1: y=3\n\na1=D, y(2)=2\n\nδ=2: y=2\n\na2=U, y(3)=3\n\nδ=3: y=3\n\na3=U, y(4)=4\n\nδ=4: y=4\n\na4=D, y(5)=3? In my earlier, I said at δ=4, a4=D to y(5)=3, but let's see:\n\nAt δ=4, position y(4), action a4, y(5) = y(4) + Δy4\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter a3=U at δ=3, y(4)=4\n\nThen at δ=4, y=4, a4: I said a4=D to y(5)=3\n\nThen y(5)=3 at δ=5.\n\nThen a5=D, y(6)=2\n\netc.\n\nBut at δ=5, y=3.\n\nWe can have higher at δ=5.\n\nFor example, from δ=2, y=2, instead of U, we can do U multiple times.\n\nδ=2: y=2, a2=U, y(3)=3\n\nδ=3: y=3, a3=U, y(4)=4\n\nδ=4: y=4, a4=U, y(5)=5\n\nThen at δ=5, y=5.\n\nBut then from y=5, to go to y=2 at δ=6, impossible, only to y=4,5,6, all unsafe.\n\nSo we need to be at low y at δ=5 to be able to reach safe at δ=6.\n\nMax y at δ=5 to reach y=2 at δ=6 is y(5)=2 or 3.\n\nIf y(5)=2, then a5=D or S or U, can go to 1,2,3.\n\nAt δ=6, y=1 or 2 safe.\n\nIf y(5)=3, then a5=D to y(6)=2 safe; or S to 3 unsafe; U to 4 unsafe.\n\nSo only with D to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y(5)=1, can go to 0,1,2 all safe.\n\nSo to have flexibility, be at y=2 or 1 or 3 with D at δ=5.\n\nBut let's set a path to be at y=2 at δ=5.\n\nFrom start:\n\nδ=0: y=2, a0=U, y(1)=3\n\nδ=1: y=3, a1=D, y(2)=2  (down to avoid being high)\n\nδ=2: y=2, a2=S, y(3)=2  (stay or up, but let's stay to save up moves)\n\nWe need to go up later.\n\nδ=3: y=2, a3=S, y(4)=2\n\nδ=4: y=2, a4=S, y(5)=2\n\nAt δ=5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a5=S, y(6)=2, safe at δ=6\n\na6=S, y(7)=2, safe at δ=7\n\nThen from here, at δ=7, y=2, we need to go to y=9.\n\nWith actions from a7 to a_{δ-1} for some δ.\n\nTo reach y(δ)=9 from y(7)=2, need to increase by 7.\n\nMinimal δ=7+7=14, with all U.\n\nBut we can start from δ=7.\n\ny(7)=2\n\nThen y(8) =2 + Δy7\n\n...\n\ny(δ) =2 + sum_{i=7}^{δ-1} Δy_i =9, so sum_{i=7}^{δ-1} Δy_i =7\n\nMinimal when all U, δ=7+7=14, y(14)=9.\n\nAt earlier times, we can go up faster, but since we wasted time staying at y=2, it takes longer.\n\nBut we can go up during the early phase when possible.\n\nFor example, from δ=2, we can go up.\n\nIn the above, at δ=2, y=2, we did S, but we can do U.\n\nLet's optimize.\n\nStart:\n\nδ=0: y=2, must do U, y(1)=3\n\nδ=1: y=3, can do U to y(2)=4, or D to y(2)=2, or S to y(2)=3.\n\nIf we do U, we get higher faster, but then at δ=5 we are high and stuck.\n\nIf we do D, we go down to 2.\n\nOr S.\n\nTo be safe at δ=6 and 7, we need to be low, so do D at δ=1.\n\na1=D, y(2)=2\n\nNow at δ=2, y=2, we can do U to y(3)=3\n\nδ=3: y=3, do U to y(4)=4\n\nδ=4: y=4, do U to y(5)=5\n\nThen at δ=5, y=5, then a5=D, y(6)=4, but y=4 unsafe at δ=6.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt δ=4, y=4, instead of U, do D to y(5)=3\n\nThen at δ=5, y=3, a5=D, y(6)=2, safe.\n\nThen a6=S, y(7)=2, safe.\n\nThen from δ=7, y=2, go up with 7 U, reach y(14)=9.\n\nBut this takes 14 turns from start, H=14.\n\nWe can go up between δ=2 to δ=4.\n\nFor example, at δ=2, y=2, a2=U, y(3)=3\n\nδ=3: y=3, a3=U, y(4)=4\n\nδ=4: y=4, a4=D, y(5)=3  (down to prepare)\n\nδ=5: y=3, a5=D, y(6)=2, safe at δ=6\n\nδ=6: y=2, a6=S, y(7)=2, safe at δ=7\n\nδ=7: y=2, a7=U, y(8)=3\n\nδ=8: a8=U, y(9)=4\n\nδ=9: a9=U, y(10)=5\n\nδ=10: a10=U, y(11)=6\n\nδ=11: a11=U, y(12)=7\n\nδ=12: a12=U, y(13)=8\n\nδ=13: a13=U, y(14)=9\n\nSo at δ=14, y=9.\n\nH=14 actions from t1=5 to t1+13, turn 5 to 18, but H is the number of actions, from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSequence of actions from t=5 to 5+13=18, 14 actions, y at turn 19? Let's clarify turns.\n\nActual turns: at turn t1=5, position y=2.\n\nAction a5 at turn 5, then y6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nAt turn 6, position y6, etc.\n\nWe want for some turn T, yT =9, with T = t1 + H -1? Earlier.\n\nSet t = t1 + τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nStart at t=5, τ=0, y5=2\n\nAction at t=5 (τ=0), a5\n\nThen y6 = y5 + Δa5\n\nAt turn 6, position y6, which is at time τ=1.\n\nGenerally, at turn t = 5 + τ, position y_{5+τ}\n\nAction a_{5+τ} for τ=0 to H-1\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t = 5 + H, position y_{5+H} is set.\n\nBut we want y_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, at turn 5, position before action, but we want y_{5} =9, but it is 2.\n\nSo with actions, after actions, position at turn 5+H-1 should be 9.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo the actions are applied at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t1, then at turn t1, after action? No.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nThen action a_t is chosen, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nWith T = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor T, y_T=9.\n\nActions from t1 to T-1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nFor example, start at turn t1, position y_{t1} =2.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn t1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} =9, before the last action or after?\n\nThe position at turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen the action at turn t1+H-1 can be S to stay, or U or D, but if it is 9, U would go to 10, not allowed, so must be S or D, but D to 8, not 9, so to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, the action at t1+H-1 must be S, or if it was 8, U to 9, but then position at turn t1+H-1 is 8 before action.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T = t1+H-1, position y_T.\n\nThen action a_T is applied, setting y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nBut we want y_T =9, regardless of the action.\n\nThen for the action, if y_T=9, a_T can be S to stay at 9, or D to 8, or U not possible.\n\nBut to reach y_T=9, it must be set by previous actions.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for y_{t1+H-1} =9, it means at turn t1+H-1, before the action, position is 9.\n\nThen the action a_{t1+H-1} can be chosen, but since we reached, we can choose S to stay.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIn the earlier path, we can reach y=9 at turn 5+13=18, for example.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by going up during the safe times.\n\nFor example, from δ=0 to δ=5, we can be at higher y if we can, but at δ=5 we need to be low for δ=6.\n\nBut at δ=2,3,4, all safe, so we can be at y=4 or 5 at δ=4, for example.\n\nBut at δ=5, we need to be at y=2 or 3 to go down to 2.\n\nLet's set y(5)=2.\n\nFrom y(0)=2, to y(5)=2, net zero change, so sum of Δy from i=0 to 4 must be 0.\n\nSo actions from δ=0 to 4: 5 actions, sum Δy =0, so equal number of U and D, or S.\n\nFor example, U and D in some order.\n\nFrom above: δ=0: U to y(1)=3\n\nδ=1: D to y(2)=2\n\nδ=2: S to y(3)=2\n\nδ=3: S to y(4)=2\n\nδ=4: S to y(5)=2\n\nOr δ=2: U to y(3)=3, then δ=3: D to y(4)=2, then δ=4: S to y(5)=2, etc.\n\nBut at y(5)=2.\n\nThen as before.\n\nTo save time, at δ=2 and δ=3, we can do U and then D, but net zero, same as staying.\n\nNo gain.\n\nOr do U at δ=2 and U at δ=3, but then y(4)=4, then we need to go down, but at δ=4, if y(4)=4, a4=D to y(5)=3, then at δ=5, y=3, a5=D to y(6)=2.\n\nThen we have y(5)=3, which is higher, but we used an extra U and D, so net the same as staying, but position at δ=5 is 3 instead of 2, but we can go down to 2 at δ=6.\n\nBut for reaching high later, it doesn't help.\n\nThe minimal H is achieved by going up as much as possible outside the critical period.\n\nCritical period δ=6,7.\n\nBefore δ=6, at δ=5, we can be at y=2,3,4,5, but to be safe at δ=6, we need to be at y=2 or 1 or 0 at δ=6.\n\nSimilarly for δ=7.\n\nSince from δ=7, we need to go up 7 steps, minimal to start from y=2 at δ=7, reach at δ=14.\n\nBut at δ=5, if we are at y=5, we can go down to y=4 at δ=6, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo the only way is to be low at δ=5.\n\nSo let's accept H=14.\n\nBut perhaps we can be on y=9 during critical period.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=9 before δ=6.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at δ=5, for example.\n\ny(5)=9.\n\nThen from y(0)=2, sum i=0 to4 Δy_i =7, with 5 actions, impossible, max sum 5, min y(5)=7 if all U, but 2+5=7, not 9.\n\ny(5) =2 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=2+5=7, so at most 7 at δ=5, not 9.\n\nSo cannot be at 9 before δ=7.\n\nEarliest at δ=7 with all U, but not safe.\n\nSo must be after.\n\nAt δ=8, y(8)=9, but as before, not possible because to have y(8)=9, we need y(7)=8 or 9, but y(7)=8 unsafe, y(7)=9 not reachable.\n\nSimilarly for later.\n\nSo the only way is to be on low row during δ=6 and 7, and go up after.\n\nMinimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach faster by being on y=9 at δ=8 or something, but not possible.\n\nAnother idea: at δ=6 and 7, be on y=1 or 2, but after δ=7, go up quickly, but from low, it takes time.\n\nPerhaps during δ=0 to 5, go up to y=7 at δ=5, then at δ=5, do nothing to go down, but can't, so not possible.\n\nI think 14 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's list the sequence with H=14.\n\nActions from turn 5 to turn 5+13=18.\n\nTurn t, action a_t.\n\nAt turn 5, position y5=2\n\na5: U (must, as only choice)\n\nThen at turn 6, position y6=3\n\na6: D (to go down to be low later)\n\nThen at turn 7, position y7=2\n\na7: U\n\nThen at turn 8, position y8=3\n\na8: U\n\nTurn 9, y9=4\n\na9: U\n\nTurn 10, y10=5\n\na10: U\n\nTurn 11, y11=6\n\na11: U\n\nTurn 12, y12=7\n\na12: U\n\nTurn 13, y13=8\n\na13: U\n\nTurn 14, y14=9\n\nBut at turn 13, y13=8, and we want to reach at turn t1+H-1=5+13-1=17? Let's set H.\n\nH= number of turns for actions, from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nStart at turn 5, y5=2.\n\nAfter actions a5 to a_{5+H-1}, position at turn (5+H-1) is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=7, turn from 5 to 11, position at turn 11 should be 9.\n\nBut with all U, y11 =2+6=8 if from turn 5 to 10 actions? Actions at turn 5 to 10 for H=6 actions, y at turn 10 or 11?\n\nActions at turn t for t=5 to 5+H-1.\n\nAfter action at turn k, y_{k+1} is set.\n\nPosition at turn k is y_k.\n\nAfter action a_k, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nSo at turn k, position y_k.\n\nAfter H actions, from turn t1 to t1+H-1, the position at turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nWith y_{t1} =2.\n\nThe number of actions from turn t1 to t1+H-2 affect y_{t1+H-1}, etc.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = 2 + sum_{k=t1}^{t1+H-2} Δy_k\n\nBecause y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1} + sum_{k=t1}^{t1+H-2} Δy_k = 2 + sum of H-1 terms of Δy.\n\nSet to 9, so sum of H-1 terms =7.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so min H-1=7, H=8.\n\nBut with H=8, sum of 7 terms must be 7, so all U.\n\nBut we saw collision.\n\nWith H=9, sum of 8 terms =7, so 7 U and 1 S, etc.\n\nBut in our case, with the critical times, it might not be possible for small H.\n\nIn the sequence I had, with y at turn 18=9.\n\nTurn t, position y_t.\n\nStart t=5, y5=2\n\na5: U, y6=3\n\na6: D, y7=2\n\na7: U, y8=3\n\na8: U, y9=4\n\na9: U, y10=5\n\na10: U, y11=6\n\na11: U, y12=7\n\na12: U, y13=8\n\na13: U, y14=9\n\nBut we want y_T=9 for some T.\n\nHere at turn 14, y14=9.\n\nT=14.\n\nt1=5, T=14, so T = t1 + 9, so H-1=9, H=10? Let's see.\n\nPosition at turn T=14 is 9.\n\nActions from turn 5 to turn 13, that's 9 actions (5 to 13 inclusive is 9 turns).\n\nH actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor T=14, y14=9, then t1+H-1=14, t1=5, so 5+H-1=14, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at turn 5 to 14? t1 to t1+H-1=5 to 5+9=14? t1+H-1=5+H-1.\n\nSet 5+H-1=14, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at turn 5 to 14, but turn 14 action sets y15, not y14.\n\nMistake.\n\nPosition at turn K is set before action at K.\n\nAfter action at K, y_{K+1} is set.\n\nSo to have y_T=9, it is set by the actions before.\n\nThe last action that affects y_T is a_{T-1}, since y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}\n\nFor y_T, it is determined by a_{T-1} from y_{T-1}.\n\nBut y_{T-1} is determined earlier.\n\nFor y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nWith y_{t1} =2.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = 2 + sum_{k=t1}^{t1+H-2} Δy_k\n\nSet to 9, so 2 + sum of (H-1) terms Δy =9, sum =7.\n\nWith H-1 terms, each in {-1,0,1}, so H-1 >=7, H>=8.\n\nMin H=8 with all U, but not safe.\n\nIn our sequence, at turn 14, y14=9, so T=14, t1+H-1=14, 5+H-1=14, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from turn 5 to turn 13 (since t1 to t1+H-1=5 to 13 for H=9? Let's calculate.\n\nH actions: indices from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, H=1: action at t1 only, then y_{t1} position, but we want it to be 9, but it is 2, not.\n\nAfter action at t1, y_{t1+1} is set, but we want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, t1+H-1=t1, y_{t1}=9, not 2.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1, position at t1+1 should be 9.\n\ny_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1} =2 + Δy, which can be 1,2,3, not 9.\n\nSo for larger H.\n\nGenerally, with S actions and D, it takes more steps.\n\nIn the sequence, to have y14=9, with y5=2, we need 9 steps: from turn 5 to 13 actions, affecting y6 to y14.\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\ny7 = y6 + Δy6 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6\n\n...\n\ny14 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + ... + Δy13 = 2 + sum_{k=5}^{13} Δy_k\n\n9 terms from k=5 to 13.\n\nSet to 9, so sum_{k=5}^{13} Δy_k =7\n\nWith 9 actions, can be 7 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence I had: actions a5=U, a6=D, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U\n\nThen y6=3, y7=2, y8=3, y9=4, y10=5, y11=6, y12=7, y13=8, y14=9\n\nSum of Δy: +1 (a5) -1 (a6) +1 (a7) +1 (a8) +1 (a9) +1 (a10) +1 (a11) +1 (a12) +1 (a13) = +7, yes.\n\nAnd at each turn, we need to check if position is safe.\n\nTurn 5: y5=2, safe\n\nTurn 6: y6=3, at turn 6, which is δ=1 (since t1=5, turn 6 is τ=1), at δ=1, y=3 safe, as before.\n\nTurn 7: y7=2, turn 7 is τ=2, at δ=2, y=2 safe.\n\nTurn 8: y8=3, τ=3, δ=3, all safe.\n\nTurn 9: y9=4, τ=4, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y10=5, τ=5, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y11=6, τ=6, at δ=6, y=6 unsafe! Oh no.\n\nAt turn 11, τ=6, y=6, and y=6 unsafe at δ=6.\n\nCollision.\n\nI forgot the critical time.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 11, which is t=11, t1=5, so τ=6, position y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nMistake.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to avoid being on y=3-8 at τ=6 and 7.\n\nτ=6 is turn 11, τ=7 turn 12.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 11, y=6, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 12, y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be on low row at those times.\n\nFor example, at turn 11 (τ=6), be on y=2.\n\nSimilarly turn 12 (τ=7), y=2.\n\nThen after that go up.\n\nSo let's set the path.\n\nStart:\n\nTurn 5 (τ=0): y5=2, safe\n\na5=U, y6=3\n\nTurn 6 (τ=1): y6=3, safe\n\na6=D, y7=2\n\nTurn 7 (τ=2): y7=2, safe\n\na7=S, y8=2\n\nTurn 8 (τ=3): y8=2, safe\n\na8=S, y9=2\n\nTurn 9 (τ=4): y9=2, safe\n\na9=S, y10=2\n\nTurn 10 (τ=5): y10=2, safe\n\na10=S, y11=2  (now τ=6, turn 11, y=2 safe)\n\nTurn 11 (τ=6): y11=2, safe\n\na11=S, y12=2  (τ=7, turn 12, y=2 safe)\n\nTurn 12 (τ=7): y12=2, safe\n\na12=U, y13=3\n\nTurn 13 (τ=8): y13=3, safe\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\nTurn 14 (τ=9): y14=4, safe\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\nTurn 15 (τ=10): y15=5, safe\n\na15=U, y16=6\n\nTurn 16 (τ=11): y16=6, safe\n\na16=U, y17=7\n\nTurn 17 (τ=12): y17=7, safe\n\na17=U, y18=8\n\nTurn 18 (τ=13): y18=8, safe\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nNow at turn 19, y19=9, but we want y_T=9 for some T.\n\nHere at turn 19, y19=9.\n\nT=19.\n\nActions from turn 5 to turn 18, that's 14 actions (5 to 18 inclusive is 14 turns).\n\nH=14.\n\nPosition at turn t1+H-1=5+13=18? t1+H-1=5+H-1.\n\nSet y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nHere y19=9, so t1+H-1=19, 5+H-1=19, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions at turn 5 to 19? Let's list turns.\n\nAction at turn t for t=5 to 5+H-1.\n\nFor H=15, actions at turn 5 to 19.\n\nAfter action at turn 19, y20 is set, but position at turn 19 is before action.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nWith t1+H-1=19, so 5+H-1=19, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions at turn 5 to 19.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions up to turn 18 to set y19=9.\n\ny19 = y18 + Δy18\n\nTo have y19=9, it could be from y18=9 and a18=S, or y18=8 and a18=U.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 18, y18=8, a18=U, y19=9.\n\nThen position at turn 19 is 9.\n\nSo for y19=9, we need action at turn 18.\n\nActions from turn 5 to turn 18 for H=14 actions.\n\nThen position at turn t1+H-1=5+13=18 is y18, which is 8, not 9.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1}=9, so for T= t1+H-1=18, y18=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, y18=8.\n\nTo have y18=9, we need to reach earlier.\n\nBut at turn 18, τ=13, we can have y18=9.\n\nFrom start, with more up actions.\n\nBut in the critical period, we stayed at y=2.\n\nFrom turn 12, y12=2, we did U to y13=3, etc., but we can do multiple U per turn when possible.\n\nFor example, from turn 12: y12=2, a12=U, y13=3\n\nTurn 13: a13=U, y14=4\n\nTurn 14: a14=U, y15=5\n\nTurn 15: a15=U, y16=6\n\nTurn 16: a16=U, y17=7\n\nTurn 17: a17=U, y18=8\n\nThen to have y18=9, not, but we can have a17=U from y17=7 to y18=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y18=9, need y17=9 or 8 with U.\n\nBut from low, not possible.\n\nWith H=15, we can have y18=9.\n\nBut let's first output the sequence with y19=9.\n\nThen H=14 actions from turn 5 to 18.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S  (y11=2 at τ=6 safe)\n\nTurn 12: S  (y12=2 at τ=7 safe)\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U  (y19=9)\n\nBut at turn 18, position y18=8, not 9, and we want y_{t1+H-1}=y18=8, not 9.\n\nFor y19=9, we need to set H so that t1+H-1=19, so 5+H-1=19, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions from turn 5 to 19.\n\nBut at turn 19, we need to have position 9, so a18 action sets y19.\n\nSo with actions at turn 5 to 19 for H=15.\n\nBut turn 19 action can be S if y19=9, or something.\n\nIn the sequence, with a18=U, y19=9.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: S  (y12=2)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y13=3)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y14=4)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y15=5)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y16=6)\n\nTurn 17: U  (y17=7)\n\nTurn 18: U  (y18=8)\n\nTurn 19: U  (y19=9) but y19=9, but at turn 19, position is 9, but action at turn 19 is not needed if we are at 9.\n\nTo have y19=9, we can have a18=U from y18=8.\n\nThen for H=15, actions from turn 5 to 19, but turn 19 action would set y20, not needed.\n\nFor position at turn 19 to be 9, it is set by previous actions up to a18.\n\nActions from turn 5 to 18 for H=14 actions, then position at turn 19 is 9, but we want position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nt1+H-1 for H=14 is 5+13=18, y18=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nSo to have y18=9, we need to reach at turn 18.\n\nFrom y5=2 to y18=9, need increase by 7 in 13 steps (actions from turn 5 to 17).\n\ny18 = y5 + sum_{k=5}^{17} Δy_k =2 + sum of 13 terms =9, so sum=7.\n\nWith 13 actions, we can have 7 U and 6 S, for example.\n\nBut to reach faster, we can have more U.\n\nBut in the critical period, we have to be low.\n\nFor example, from turn 5 to turn 10, we can be at y=2, as before.\n\nThen from turn 11 to turn 17, go up.\n\nTurn 11: y11=2, a11=U, y12=3\n\nTurn 12: y12=3, a12=U, y13=4\n\nTurn 13: y13=4, a13=U, y14=5\n\nTurn 14: y14=5, a14=U, y15=6\n\nTurn 15: y15=6, a15=U, y16=7\n\nTurn 16: y16=7, a16=U, y17=8\n\nTurn 17: y17=8, a17=U, y18=9\n\nAt turn 18, y18=9.\n\nNow check safety:\n\nTurn 11: τ=6, y=2, safe\n\nTurn 12: τ=7, y=3, but at τ=7, y=3 unsafe! Oh.\n\nAt turn 12, τ=7, y=3, and y=3 unsafe at δ=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nBecause we went up at turn 12 to y=3, but at τ=7, y=3 is unsafe.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTo avoid, at turn 12 (τ=7), we need to be on safe row, so y=0,1,2,9.\n\nBut we are at y=3, unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on y=3 at τ=7.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 12, if we do S or D, but from turn 11, y11=2, a11=U to y12=3, unsafe.\n\nIf a11=S, y12=2, safe at τ=7.\n\nBut then we are not going up.\n\nSo at turn 12, position y12, must be safe, so if at turn 11, y11=2, a11=S, y12=2, safe.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=3, etc.\n\nBut then we reach later.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 11 (τ=6): y11=2, a11=S, y12=2 (safe at τ=7)\n\nTurn 12 (τ=7): y12=2, a12=U, y13=3\n\nTurn 13: a13=U, y14=4\n\nTurn 14: a14=U, y15=5\n\nTurn 15: a15=U, y16=6\n\nTurn 16: a16=U, y17=7\n\nTurn 17: a17=U, y18=8\n\nTurn 18: a18=U, y19=9\n\nThen at turn 19, y19=9.\n\nH=15 actions from turn 5 to 19? Actions to set y19.\n\nActions from turn 5 to 18 for H=14.\n\nPosition at turn 19=9.\n\nBut we want for T=19, y19=9.\n\nt1+H-1=19, 5+H-1=19, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions at turn 5 to 19, but turn 19 action not needed.\n\nI think it's better to output the sequence for reaching at turn 19.\n\nMinimal H is 15.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with less.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, go up to y=5 or 6 at δ=5, but then at δ=5, do something to move to safe, but can't.\n\nOr, since at δ=6 and 7, y=1 and 2 are safe, and y=1 is only unsafe at δ=1, so at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=1 at δ=6 and 7.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think 15 is the best.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S  (y11=2 at τ=6)\n\nTurn 12: S  (y12=2 at τ=7)\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U  (y19=9)\n\nBut for H, with actions from turn 5 to 18, H=14, position at turn 18 is y18=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at turn 19=9, we need to include action at turn 18.\n\nSo for the answer, set H=15, actions from turn 5 to 19, but at turn 19, if we do action, it changes y20, but position at turn 19 is before action, so to have y19=9, it is set by previous.\n\nSo actions from turn 5 to 18 for H=14 actions, then y19=9.\n\nPosition at turn t1+H-1=5+13=18 is y18=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nSo to have y18=9, we need to reach at turn 18.\n\nBut from above, with the critical period, we can't reach before turn 19 in this setup.\n\nUnless we go up during the early phase when possible.\n\nFor example, at turn 7 (τ=2), y7=2, instead of S, do U to y8=3, then U to y9=4, etc., but at turn 11 and 12, we need to be at y=2 for safety.\n\nIf we go up to turn 10, y10=4, for example, then at turn 10, a10 must be to go down or something, but at turn 11, we need y11=2.\n\nFrom y10=4, to y11=2, impossible.\n\nMax change 1 per step.\n\nSo must be at y=2 or 3 at turn 10 to reach y=2 at turn 11.\n\nIf y10=2, a10=S, y11=2\n\nOr y10=3, a10=D, y11=2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo in the early phase, we can be at most y=3 at turn 10.\n\nThen after turn 12, we go up.\n\nFrom turn 12, y12=2, to y18=9, need 7 steps, so turn 18 y18=8, turn 19 y19=9.\n\nCannot reach at turn 18.\n\nSo minimal to reach at turn 19 with y19=9.\n\nH=15 actions from turn 5 to 19, but position at turn 19 is 9, so t1+H-1=19, 5+H-1=19, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions at turn 5 to 19, but turn 19 action is not necessary if we are already at 9, but in the sequence, we use a18 to set y19=9 from y18=8.\n\nSo actions include turn 18.\n\nFor the sequence, list actions from turn 5 to turn 18 for H=14, with y19=9.\n\nBut the position is at turn 19, not at the last action turn.\n\nAccording to the problem, we need y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo for H=15, t1+H-1=5+14=19, y19=9.\n\nActions at turn 5 to 19.\n\nBut at turn 19, action a19 can be S to stay, but position at turn 19 is 9 before action.\n\nSo we can set a19=S or omit, but the sequence includes up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nSo include a19=S.\n\nBut it's redundant.\n\nTo save, we can reach at turn 18 with y18=9, but not possible.\n\nI think we have to accept.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nMinimal H=15\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S  (to stay at 9, but not necessary, but to have the action)\n\nSince at turn 18, a18=U, y19=9, then at turn 19, position 9, so for action at turn 19, we can do S to stay.\n\nBut for the sequence, we can list up to turn 18, but then position at turn 18 is not 9.\n\nSo include turn 19 action.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: a5=U\n\nTurn 6: a6=D\n\nTurn 7: a7=S\n\nTurn 8: a8=S\n\nTurn 9: a9=S\n\nTurn 10: a10=S\n\nTurn 11: a11=S\n\nTurn 12: a12=S\n\nTurn 13: a13=U\n\nTurn 14: a14=U\n\nTurn 15: a15=U\n\nTurn 16: a16=U\n\nTurn 17: a17=U\n\nTurn 18: a18=U  (y19=9)\n\nTurn 19: a19=S  (but y19=9, action S to stay, but not necessary for reaching, but to have the position at turn 19)\n\nWith a18=U, y19=9, position at turn 19 is 9.\n\nThen for action at turn 19, it is separate.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=15, actions up to turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 19, we do S, but it doesn't change position.\n\nSo we can omit, but to be precise, include it.\n\nSince the position is reached at turn 19, and we include action at turn 19 to complete the sequence.\n\nBut in the output format, list the actions.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTo make H smaller, but I think it's minimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is \\(H = 15\\). The sequence of actions from turn 5 to turn 19 ensures that the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19 and avoids all unsafe positions at each turn, based on the car movement rules and collision conditions.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The player must not be on freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at relative times \\(\\delta = 6\\) and \\(\\delta = 7\\) (turns 11 and 12) because these positions are unsafe due to car spans covering \\(x = 0\\) at those times. Safe rows during \\(\\delta = 6\\) and \\(\\delta = 7\\) are \\(y = 0, 1, 2, 9\\).\n- **Path Rationale**: \n  - From turn 5 to turn 12, the player stays at or returns to \\(y = 2\\) (safe during critical times) using a combination of up, down, and stay actions to avoid being on unsafe rows at \\(\\delta = 1\\) (turn 6) and during \\(\\delta = 6-7\\) (turns 11-12).\n  - After the critical period, the player moves up consistently from turn 13 to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 19.\n- **Efficiency**: This path uses the minimal \\(H = 15\\) because:\n  - Reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires a net increase of 7 in the y-position.\n  - The critical unsafe times at \\(\\delta = 6\\) and \\(\\delta = 7\\) force the player to spend turns 11 and 12 at \\(y = 2\\), delaying the ascent.\n  - Attempts to reach \\(y = 9\\) earlier (e.g., by \\(\\delta = 7\\) or \\(\\delta = 8\\)) result in collisions at \\(\\delta = 6\\) or \\(\\delta = 7\\) on rows \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 5 to 19 is as follows:\n\n- Turn 5: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 6: \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 7: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 8: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 9: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 10: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 11: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\), safe at \\(\\delta = 6\\))\n- Turn 12: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\), safe at \\(\\delta = 7\\))\n- Turn 13: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 14: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 15: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 16: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 17: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 18: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 19: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\))\n\nAt turn 19, the player position is \\((0, 9)\\), and the action \\(U\\) is valid since \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18 allows moving up to \\(y = 9\\) within bounds. The position \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn 19, and all intermediate positions are safe (no collision at any turn).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has cars moving left or right at given speeds. Collision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway k, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars move continuously between turns, but we only care about their positions at integer turns because collision is checked at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=6. So t1=6.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). And y must stay within 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when cars are at position x=0 at integer turns.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t=6.\n\nFor each car, given head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nFor left-moving cars, at time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince t1=6, T is the turn number, so time elapsed is (T - 6).\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if for the freeway I'm on at turn T, 0 is in some car's span at that turn.\n\nAlso, note: when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. But at turn T, I am on y_T, so collision is checked based on cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T, so only cars on freeway y_T matter for collision at turn T. Cars on other freeways don't matter.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, after action, I go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I'm still on y_T.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=3 to y=9 with minimal H, meaning minimal number of turns including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions? Let's read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd after H actions, at time t1 + H, y should be 9? No.\n\nThe player position after action a_t is y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, I take action a_t, which moves me to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nBut the turn is defined such that at turn t, I am at (0, y_t).\n\nThen I take action a_t, and at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn based on y_t.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so actions at times: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1+H-1}, at time t1+H, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at t1, y_{t1} = 3.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H, with y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? No.\n\nLook: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\" in the task? No.\n\nTask: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter taking these H actions, the position at time t1+H should be (0,9)? No.\n\nAt time t1, before any action, position is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,3).\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at time t1+1, position is y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{t1+H-1}, at time t1+H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, leading to y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the minimal H such that this is possible without collision.\n\nAlso, at each intermediate turn t from t1 to t1+H-1, when we are at y_t, there should be no collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we take action a_t, but collision is checked based on y_t at turn t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nSo for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, we need to ensure that at that turn, for the row y_t, 0 is not in any car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nAt turn t1+H, we are at y=9, but since the goal is to reach (0,9), and y=9 is the top row, I think there are no cars on y=9, so no collision to worry about there. Similarly, y=0 has no cars, I assume, but we start at y=3, going to 9.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nSo only when on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at turn t=6.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 2: similarly, (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3? (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: only one: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 6: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nNow, for each, I need to find when 0 is in the span for integer turns T >=6.\n\nFirst, let's handle the left-moving cars.\n\nFor a left-moving car, span at time T: [h - s(T-6), τ - s(T-6)]\n\nSince moving left, decreasing x.\n\nCollision if 0 is in [h - s(T-6), τ - s(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nBut for a given freeway, multiple cars, so I need to find for each turn T, if there is any car on that freeway with 0 in span.\n\nSince we care about when 0 is occupied, I can find for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so for each freeway, I need the set of T where at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nLet me start with freeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: [ -24 - 36(T-6), 11 - 36(T-6) ]\n\nSet 0 in this interval.\n\nSo min = -24 -36(T-6), max = 11 -36(T-6)\n\nSince left-moving, min is left end, max is right end? No.\n\nh is head, τ is tail, but for left-moving, as time increases, both decrease.\n\nThe span is [left end, right end] with left end decreasing.\n\nAt T, left end: h - s(T-6) = -24 -36(T-6)\n\nRight end: τ - s(T-6) = 11 -36(T-6)\n\n0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo -24 -36(T-6) <= 0 and 0 <= 11 -36(T-6)\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36(T-6) <= 0 => -36(T-6) <= 24 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-6) >= -24\n\nBetter to solve:\n\n-24 -36(T-6) <= 0\n\n-36(T-6) <= 24\n\nDivide by -36, reverse inequality: (T-6) >= -24/36 = -2/3\n\nSince T-6 integer, T-6 >= 0? -2/3, so T-6 >= ceil(-2/3) = 0? Ceil of -2/3 is 0? No, ceil is smallest integer greater than or equal.\n\n-2/3 is about -0.666, ceil is 0? No, ceil(-0.666) is 0? Ceil is for real numbers, ceil(x) smallest integer >= x.\n\nceil(-0.666) = 0, yes.\n\nBut inequality: (T-6) >= -2/3\n\nSince T-6 integer, T-6 >= 0? -2/3, integers greater than or equal to -2/3 are 0,1,2,... or negative? -1 is less than -2/3? -1 = -0.666? -1 < -0.666, since -1 = -1.0 < -0.666.\n\n-1 < -0.666, so -1 is not >= -0.666.\n\n-0.666 <= x for x integer, x >= ceil(-0.666) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 11 -36(T-6) => 36(T-6) <= 11 => (T-6) <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so T-6 <= floor(0.305) = 0\n\nSince T-6 integer.\n\nSo from first: T-6 >= ceil(-2/3) = ceil(-0.666) = 0\n\nFrom second: T-6 <= floor(11/36) = floor(0.305) = 0\n\nSo T-6 >= 0 and T-6 <= 0, so T-6 = 0, i.e., T=6.\n\nAt T=6, left end: -24 -36(0) = -24, right end: 11 -0 =11, so [ -24,11], 0 is in it.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nFor example T=5, but T>=6, so only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same car, so also only at T=6, 0 is covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)]\n\nτ = -41, h = -30, s=6\n\nSo left end: τ + s(T-6) = -41 + 6(T-6)\n\nRight end: h + s(T-6) = -30 + 6(T-6)\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right, so -41 +6(T-6) <= 0 and 0 <= -30 +6(T-6)\n\nFirst: -41 +6(T-6) <= 0 => 6(T-6) <= 41 => T-6 <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so T-6 <= 6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 +6(T-6) => 30 <= 6(T-6) => 5 <= T-6, so T-6 >= 5\n\nThus T-6 >=5 and T-6 <=6, so T-6=5 or 6.\n\nT=6: left = -41 +0 = -41, right = -30 +0 = -30, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, since -41 to -30, all negative, 0 not <= -30? 0 <= right? right is -30, 0 <= -30? False, so at T=6, 0 not in span.\n\nT-6=5: T=11? T-6=5, T=11.\n\nLeft: -41 +6*5 = -41+30= -11\n\nRight: -30 +30=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since right end 0.\n\nSimilarly, T-6=6: T=12\n\nLeft: -41 +36= -5? 6*6=36, -41+36=-5, right: -30+36=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nBut for collision, at T, if 0 in span.\n\nAt T=11, span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly T=12, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nBut T-6=5 or 6, so T=11 or 12.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nHead 48, tail 37, direction right.\n\nτ=37, h=48? Head is larger? In the span, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h I assume.\n\nGiven (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head increases.\n\nAt time T, span [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)]\n\nτ=37, h=48, s=6\n\nLeft end: τ + s(T-6) =37 +6(T-6)\n\nRight end: h + s(T-6)=48+6(T-6)\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nLeft =37 +6(T-6) >=37 >0, so left >0, thus 0 <= left is false, so 0 not <= right? 0 <= right might be true, but since left >0, 0 < left <= right, so 0 not in [left,right] since left >0.\n\nThus for all T, left >=37 >0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car on freeway 3: (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nτ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [1 +6(T-6), 12 +6(T-6)]\n\nLeft: 1 +6(T-6) >=1 >0 for T>=6, so always left >0, thus 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the first car can have 0 in span, at T=11 and T=12.\n\nT=11: span [-11,0], 0 included; T=12: [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? According to table: (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nSame as freeway 3, so similarly, only at T=11 and T=12, 0 is covered by the first car.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nSame as above, τ=-41, h=-30, s=6, right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, 0 in span when T-6 >=5 and T-6 <=6, so T=11,12.\n\nAt T=11: span [-11,0], 0 in; T=12: [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8: all have only this car: (-30,-41,right,6), so for each, 0 covered at T=11 and T=12.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 each have one car, same as above.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns where 0 is occupied (collision possible):\n\ny=1: only at T=6\n\ny=2: only at T=6\n\ny=3: at T=11,12\n\ny=4: at T=11,12\n\ny=5: at T=11,12\n\ny=6: at T=11,12\n\ny=7: at T=11,12\n\ny=8: at T=11,12\n\ny=3 and y=4 have multiple cars, but only at T=11,12, as above.\n\nNow, we start at turn t=6, y=3.\n\nAt turn t=6, we are on y=3.\n\nIs there collision at t=6 on y=3? From above, for y=3, occupied at T=11,12, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, for y=3, we have cars, but as computed, for the first car, at T=6, span [-41,-30], not including 0; other cars don't cover 0, so at T=6, on y=3, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1 and y=2, occupied at T=6, but we are not on them at T=6.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe critical points are that on rows y=3 to 8, at turns T=11 and T=12, there is a car at x=0, so if we are on any of these rows at T=11 or T=12, we collide.\n\nSpecifically, for y=3,4,5,6,7,8, all have collision at T=11 and T=12.\n\ny=3 and y=4 have cars only at T=11,12? Yes, from above.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 also only at T=11,12.\n\nAnd at other times, no collision on these rows? For example, on y=3, at other times, no car covers x=0, similarly for others.\n\ny=1 and y=2 have collision only at T=6, but we are not on them, and we might not need to go there.\n\nWe start at y=3 at t=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nThe minimal H: we need to go from y=3 to y=9, which is 6 steps up, but we can stay or go down, but to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on rows 3-8 at turns 11 and 12.\n\nTurns: current turn t=6.\n\nWe are at turn 6, y=3.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some future turn.\n\nLet T_arrive be the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nBut we might pass through earlier.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, from y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 moves up, so at least 6 actions, so H >=6, arriving at turn 6+6=12 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut at turn 12, if we are on y=9, no problem, but if we arrive earlier, we might be safe.\n\ny=9 no cars.\n\nBut during the path, we must not be on rows 3-8 at turns 11 and 12.\n\nTurns 11 and 12 are critical.\n\nNow, turn 11 and 12 correspond to time from start: t=6 is now, so turn 11 is 5 turns later (t=7,8,9,10,11: 5 steps from t=6 to t=11? Let's see.\n\nTurn t=6: current\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=6\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=7\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=6+k\n\nAt time t=6, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=6+H.\n\nWe want y_{t=6+H} =9.\n\nAt each turn τ from t=6 to t=6+H-1, we are at y_τ, and must be safe, meaning if y_τ between 1 and 8, no collision on that row at turn τ.\n\nAt turn t=6+H, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nNow, turns: let τ = turn number.\n\nWe need for τ from 6 to 6+H-1, if y_τ in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then τ not in the collision turns for that row.\n\nSpecifically, for rows 3-8, collision at τ=11 and τ=12.\n\nFor row 1 and 2, collision only at τ=6.\n\nSince we start at τ=6, y=3, and row 3 has no collision at τ=6, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on rows 3-8 at τ=11 and τ=12.\n\nThat is, at turn 11 and turn 12, we should not be on y=3,4,5,6,7, or 8.\n\nSo we must be on y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\ny=0 or y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, turn 11 and 12 are fixed.\n\nCurrent turn: τ=6.\n\nWe are at y=3.\n\nAfter k turns, at τ=6+k.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some time.\n\nThe critical turns are τ=11 and 12.\n\nτ=11 is at time offset: from τ=6 to τ=11, it's 5 turns later, so after 5 actions, we are at τ=11.\n\nSimilarly, τ=12 is after 6 actions.\n\nLet t_rel = τ - 6, time relative to now.\n\nSo at t_rel=0: τ=6, y=3\n\nAfter H actions, at t_rel=H, τ=6+H, y=9.\n\nAt each step t_rel from 0 to H-1, at time τ=6 + t_rel, position y_{τ} must be safe.\n\nFor τ=11 and 12, which is t_rel=5 and 6.\n\nAt t_rel=5, τ=11, we must not be on rows 3-8, so y must be 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly at t_rel=6, τ=12, y must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut at t_rel=6, if we are at y=9, that's fine, but we might not have arrived yet.\n\nNow, we start from y=3 at t_rel=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: if we go up every time, after 6 moves, at t_rel=6, we are at y=9, since from y=3, up 6 times to y=9.\n\nBut at t_rel=5, τ=11, where are we?\n\nIf we go up every step:\n\nt_rel | action | y after action? Let's track position.\n\nAt time τ, before action, y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nBut for collision, at each τ, we care about y_τ.\n\nSo let's list the sequence of y at each turn τ.\n\nStart: τ=6, y=3\n\nThen we choose action a_6, then y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nThen at τ=7, y_7, and so on.\n\nIf we always go up: a_t = U for t from 6 onwards.\n\nThen:\n\nτ=6: y=3\n\na_6=U, so y_7 = 3+1=4\n\nτ=7: y=4\n\na_7=U, y_8=5\n\nτ=8: y=5\n\na_8=U, y_9=6\n\nτ=9: y=6\n\na_9=U, y_10=7\n\nτ=10: y=7\n\na_10=U, y_11=8\n\nτ=11: y=8\n\na_11=U, y_12=9\n\nτ=12: y=9\n\nNow, at τ=11, y=8, which is row 8, and at τ=11, for row 8, there is collision (since all rows 3-8 have collision at τ=11), so we collide at τ=11.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=12, we are at y=9, safe, but at τ=11 we collide.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 3-8 at τ=11 and τ=12.\n\nSo at τ=11 and τ=12, we must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the target, so we can be there.\n\nSince we start from y=3, and need to reach y=9, we might arrive early or late.\n\nBut at τ=11 and 12, we need to be safe.\n\nOne way is to be on y=9 by τ=11 or earlier.\n\nFrom τ=6, y=3, to y=9, minimum 6 steps, so earliest arrival at τ=12, with y_12=9 if we go up every turn.\n\nτ=6: y=3\n\nAfter 1 up: τ=7, y=4\n\nAfter 2: τ=8, y=5\n\nAfter 3: τ=9, y=6\n\nAfter 4: τ=10, y=7\n\nAfter 5: τ=11, y=8\n\nAfter 6: τ=12, y=9\n\nSo at τ=11, y=8, which is bad.\n\nWe can arrive later, but that might take more turns.\n\nOr, we can go to y=0 or stay low, but y=0 is safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nSince at τ=11 and 12, we need to be on y=0 or 9, and y=9 is better.\n\nBut to reach y=9 by τ=11, we need to go from y=3 to y=9 in 5 steps? From τ=6 to τ=11 is 5 turns later.\n\nAt τ=6, we are at y=3.\n\nAfter actions at τ=6,7,8,9,10, we set y_7 to y_11.\n\nAt τ=11, y_11 must be 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly for τ=12.\n\nNow, from y=3 at τ=6, to have y_11=9, we need to increase y by 6 in 5 steps (from τ=6 to τ=11, actions at τ=6 to τ=10, 5 actions).\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so maximum y_11 = 3 + 5*1 = 8, if all up.\n\ny_11 <= 3 + 5 = 8, so cannot be 9 at τ=11.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_11=0, we can, by going down.\n\nBut we need to go to 9 later.\n\nAt τ=12, y_12 must be 0 or 9.\n\nIf we can have y_12=9, that is possible with 6 actions, as above, but at τ=11 we are at y=8, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to be safe at τ=11 and τ=12.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Be at y=9 at τ=11: impossible, as above, max y_11=8.\n\n- Be at y=0 at τ=11.\n\nThen from y=0 at τ=11, we can go to y=9 later.\n\nBut at τ=12, we need to be safe, so if at τ=12 we are on y=0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSince y=9 requires 6 steps up from y=3, and we have to be at safe spot at τ=11 and 12.\n\nτ=11 is in 5 steps from now.\n\nLet me list possible y at τ=11.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=6, after 5 actions (at τ=6 to τ=10), we set y_11.\n\nEach action: U, D, or S, so y_11 can be from max(0,3-5)=0 to min(9,3+5)=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_11 must be 0 or 9 for safety, but y_11 <=8, so only possible is y_11=0.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=12, y_12 must be 0 or 9.\n\nNow, if y_11=0, then at τ=11, we are safe.\n\nThen at τ=12, y_12 can be 0 or 1, depending on action at τ=11.\n\nBut y_12 must be 0 or 9 for safety at τ=12.\n\nSo if y_11=0, we can go to y_12=0 (stay or down, but y=0, down to -1 not allowed, so S or U.\n\nIf S, y_12=0; if U, y_12=1.\n\nNow y_12 must be 0 or 9 for safety, so if y_12=1, not safe, since row 1 has no collision? But row 1 has collision only at τ=6, not at other times, so at τ=12, on row 1, is it safe?\n\nFor row 1: only collision at τ=6, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly row 2 only at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=12, for row 1, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows except 3-8 at τ=11,12.\n\nAt τ=12, for rows 1 and 2, no collision, since only at τ=6.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=11, for rows 1 and 2, no collision.\n\nOnly rows 3-8 have collision at τ=11 and 12.\n\nRows 1 and 2 are safe at τ=11 and 12.\n\ny=0 and y=9 also safe.\n\nSo at τ=11, to be safe, we can be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable, so y=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly at τ=12, we can be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nNow, from start y=3 at τ=6.\n\nTo have y_11 in {0,1,2} or 9, but 9 impossible, so y_11 in {0,1,2}.\n\nSimilarly, y_12 can be in {0,1,2,9}.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 by τ=12, that would be with H=6, but at τ=11 we were at y=8, which is not safe, but we need y_11 to be safe.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nOne option: go down to a safe row by τ=11.\n\nFor example, go to y=2 or y=1 or y=0 by τ=11.\n\ny=0,1,2 are safe at all times except y=1,2 at τ=6, but τ=6 is past, so safe.\n\nNow, from y=3 to y=0,1, or 2 in 5 steps.\n\nWe can do it with some down actions.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9.\n\nBut going down takes extra steps.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, let's list the constraints.\n\nWe need to be at safe position at τ=11 and τ=12.\n\nτ=11: y_11 in {0,1,2} since 9 impossible.\n\nτ=12: y_12 in {0,1,2,9}\n\nAnd we need y_{6+H} =9 for some H.\n\nNow, the earliest we can be at y=9 is τ=12, with y_12=9 if we go up from y=8 at τ=11, but y_11=8 is not safe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 at τ=12 if we want y_11 safe.\n\nNext possible arrival: τ=13, with y_13=9.\n\nThen at τ=11 and τ=12, we can be on safe rows.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nBut τ=13 might be later than necessary.\n\nWe can be at y=9 earlier? τ=12 is earliest possible, but conflict.\n\nτ=11 not possible.\n\nSo minimal arrival time is τ=12 or later, but τ=12 with y=9 requires y_11=8, unsafe.\n\nSo must arrive at τ=13 or later.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt τ=12, if we are at y=9, it is safe, but to get there, at τ=11 we need to be at y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=9 at τ=12, that means action at τ=11 was U from y_11=8.\n\nBut at τ=11, y_11=8, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at τ=12 with safe path.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at τ=11 impossible.\n\nSo earliest possible arrival at y=9 is τ=13, with y_13=9.\n\nThen at τ=13, safe.\n\nNow, at τ=11 and τ=12, we need to be on safe rows: y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut at τ=12, if we are not at y=9, we can be on 0,1,2.\n\nNow, from y=3 at τ=6, to y_13=9, we need to increase by 6 in 7 steps (actions at τ=6 to 12, 7 actions).\n\nMinimal actions to go from 3 to 9 is 6, so with 7 actions, we have one extra action, which we can use to go down or stay to adjust.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be at safe spot at τ=11 and τ=12.\n\nτ=11 is after 5 actions (actions τ=6 to 10).\n\ny_11 set by actions up to τ=10.\n\nSimilarly, y_12 set by actions up to τ=11.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nWe need y_11 in {0,1,2}\n\nAnd y_12 in {0,1,2,9}\n\nBut y_12=9 only if we are going up from y_11, but y_11 <=2, so y_12 <=3 if U, not 9.\n\nIf y_11=2, U to y_12=3, but y=3 at τ=12 is unsafe, since row 3 collision at τ=12.\n\nSimilarly, if y_11=1, U to y_12=2, safe; or S to 1, safe; D to 0, safe.\n\nBut y_12=2 or 1 or 0, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=13, we need y_12 such that with action at τ=12, we go to 9.\n\nSo y_12 must be 8 or 9, but y_12=9 not yet, so y_12=8, then U to 9.\n\nBut y_12=8 at τ=12 is unsafe, since row 8 collision.\n\ny_12=9 at τ=12 would be safe, but we arrive at τ=13.\n\nAt τ=12, if y_12=9, then we have arrived, but to have y_12=9, we need action at τ=11 from y_11=8, but y_11=8 unsafe.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=9 at τ=12 or earlier with safety.\n\nNext, τ=13: y_13=9.\n\nThen at τ=13, safe.\n\nNow at τ=11 and τ=12, we need to be on safe rows.\n\ny_11 in {0,1,2}\n\ny_12 in {0,1,2} since y_12=9 not possible at τ=12 if arriving at 13.\n\ny_12 must be 8 to go to 9 at τ=13, but y_12=8 at τ=12 unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y_12=9 at τ=12, we have arrived, but not possible.\n\nSo for arrival at τ=13, at τ=12 we must be at y_12=8, then a_12=U to y_13=9.\n\nBut at τ=12, y_12=8, which is on row 8, and at τ=12, collision, so unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on row 8 at τ=12.\n\nSimilarly, any row 3-8 at τ=11 or 12 unsafe.\n\nSo to have y_13=9, we need y_12 such that y_12 + Δy_12 =9, so y_12=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_12=9, arrived early, but not possible; so y_12 must be 8.\n\nBut at τ=12, y_12=8 is unsafe.\n\nThus, it is impossible to reach y=9 at τ=13 with safety, because it requires being at y=8 at τ=12.\n\nSimilarly for earlier times.\n\nNow, what about τ=14? y_14=9.\n\nThen at τ=13, we must be at y_13=8 or 9 to go to 9.\n\nIf y_13=9, arrived early; else y_13=8, then U to 9.\n\nBut at τ=13, is there collision?\n\nThe collision times are only at τ=11 and 12 for rows 3-8.\n\nAt other times, no collision on those rows.\n\nAt τ=13, for example, on row 8, is it safe?\n\nFor row 8, only collision at τ=11 and 12, so at τ=13, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo at τ=13, we can be on row 8, safe.\n\nSimilarly at τ=12, we need to be safe, so not on 3-8.\n\nSo for arrival at τ=14: y_14=9.\n\nThen y_13 must be 8 or 9. If y_13=9, arrived early, so must be y_13=8, then a_13=U to y_14=9.\n\nAt τ=13, y_13=8, which is safe because τ=13 not 11 or 12.\n\nAt τ=12, we need y_12 safe, so in {0,1,2,9}, but not 9, so {0,1,2}.\n\nSimilarly at τ=11, y_11 in {0,1,2}.\n\nNow, we start from y_6=3.\n\nTo have y_11 in {0,1,2}, we need to decrease or stay low.\n\nThen from there, go to y_13=8 and then to y_14=9.\n\nBut y_13=8.\n\nNow, let's count the turns.\n\nFrom τ=6 to τ=11: 5 steps (actions at τ=6 to 10)\n\ny_11 must be in {0,1,2}\n\nThen from τ=11 to τ=13: 2 steps (actions at τ=11 and 12)\n\ny_13 must be 8.\n\nThen action at τ=13 to go to y_14=9.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach at τ=6+H.\n\nWith y_14=9, so τ=14, so H=8 actions? τ=6 to τ=14, actions at τ=6 to 13, 8 actions, arrive at τ=14.\n\nBut we can do with less?\n\nPerhaps arrive later but with fewer actions by going directly, but we have to avoid the bad times.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nAnother option: be at y=9 at τ=12, but we need to not be on bad rows at τ=11.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at τ=12, we must be at y=8 at τ=11, which is bad, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, no way to be at y=9 at τ=11 or 12.\n\nAt τ=13, to be at y=9, must be at y=8 at τ=12, but τ=12 y=8 bad.\n\nAt τ=14, to be at y=9, must be at y=8 at τ=13, which is safe, and at τ=12 we can be safe.\n\nSo possible.\n\nCan we arrive earlier than τ=14?\n\nτ=13: if we are at y=9 at τ=13, then at τ=12 we must be at y=8, but τ=12 y=8 bad, so impossible.\n\nτ=12: impossible as above.\n\nSo earliest possible arrival is τ=14 with y_14=9.\n\nThen H=8 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nτ=14 = 6 + 8? τ=6 + H, y_{6+H} =9.\n\nWith H=8, τ=14.\n\nActions from τ=6 to τ=13, 8 actions.\n\nNow, we need to have at τ=11 and τ=12, y in {0,1,2}\n\nAnd at τ=13, y=8\n\nThen at τ=14, y=9.\n\nFrom y_11 to y_13.\n\ny_11 in {0,1,2}\n\nThen after two actions, y_13 = y_11 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\nSince y_13=8, and y_11 <=2, so we need to increase by at least 6 in two steps, but each step max +1, so y_13 <= y_11 + 2 <= 4, but we need y_13=8, impossible.\n\ny_11 <=2, y_12 = y_11 + Δy11 <= 2+1=3\n\ny_13 = y_12 + Δy12 <= 3+1=4\n\nBut we need y_13=8, which is greater than 4, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nWhat's wrong.\n\nFor arrival at τ=14, y_14=9.\n\nThen y_13 must be 8 or 9.\n\nSince not 9, y_13=8.\n\nThen at τ=13, y_13=8.\n\nNow, y_13 is set by actions up to τ=12.\n\nAt τ=12, we have y_12, then action a_12 determines y_13.\n\nSo y_13 = y_12 + Δy12\n\nTo have y_13=8, y_12 must be 7,8, or 9, and Δy12 accordingly.\n\nBut y_12 must be in safe set at τ=12, so y_12 in {0,1,2,9}, but not 9, so {0,1,2}.\n\nBut y_12 <=2, so y_13 = y_12 + Δy12 <= 2+1=3 <8, cannot be 8.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, if y_12=9, but not possible.\n\nSo we cannot have y_13=8 with y_12 in {0,1,2}.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at τ=14 with the constraints.\n\nBut we need to be at safe position at τ=12.\n\ny_12 must be in {0,1,2} for safety, but to reach y=9 soon, we need to be higher.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at τ=12, but only if we can avoid being on bad row at τ=11, but we must be at y=8 at τ=11.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at τ=11, impossible.\n\nSo what's the solution?\n\nPerhaps we can stay at low y until after τ=12, then go up fast.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need multiple up actions.\n\nLet's list all turns from τ=6 to say τ=14.\n\nWe need to specify y at each turn from τ=6 to τ=6+H-1, and at τ=6+H, y=9.\n\nAt each τ from 6 to 6+H-1, y_τ must be safe.\n\nFor τ=11 and 12, y_τ must not be in 3-8, so in 0,1,2.\n\nFor other τ, any y is fine, as long as on rows 1-8, no collision at that τ.\n\nBut for rows 1-2, only collision at τ=6, which is past, so for τ>6, rows 1-2 are always safe.\n\nRows 3-8 safe except at τ=11,12.\n\ny=0 and 9 always safe.\n\nSo the only dangerous turns are τ=11 and 12, and at those times, we must be on y=0,1,2.\n\nNow, from y=3 at τ=6, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe constraining points are at τ=11 and 12.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible except around the bad times.\n\nFor example, from τ=6 to τ=10, we can go up to some point, but at τ=11 we need to be low, so we need to go down before τ=11.\n\nThen after τ=12, go up to 9.\n\nLet's think of the net displacement.\n\nWe start at y=3.\n\nWe need to end at y=9, net +6.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nSo number of U minus number of D must be 6.\n\nTotal actions H, let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, U + D + S = H, U - D =6.\n\nThen y changes from 3 to 3 + (U - D) =3+6=9.\n\nNow, at each step, y must be between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the critical point is at τ=11, we need y_11 <=2.\n\nSimilarly at τ=12, y_12 <=2 or 9, but 9 unlikely, so y_12 <=2.\n\nSince at τ=12, if we are not at 9, we must be low.\n\nBut to reach high later, we need to go up after.\n\nNow, τ=11 is after 5 actions from start (actions at τ=6 to 10).\n\nSimilarly, τ=12 after 6 actions (τ=6 to 11).\n\nLet k = τ - 6, so at k=0: y=3\n\nAfter m actions, at time k=m, y_k.\n\nAt k=5, τ=11, y_5 must be in {0,1,2}\n\nAt k=6, τ=12, y_6 must be in {0,1,2}\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 at some k=H.\n\nWith U - D =6.\n\nNow, the position at k=5 must be <=2.\n\nSince we start at 3, to be at 2 or less at k=5, we need some down actions.\n\nSimilarly at k=6, must be <=2.\n\nThen after that, we go up to 9.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is after more actions.\n\nFor example, from k=6, y_6 <=2, then to y=9, need at least 7 up actions, so at k=13, y_13=9 if all up.\n\ny at k=6 is <=2, say 2.\n\nThen after 7 U, at k=13, y=2+7=9.\n\nActions from k=6 to k=12, 7 actions.\n\nBut at k=6, y_6 is after 6 actions.\n\nLet's define the state.\n\nAt time k (relative), after t actions, we are at turn τ=6+k, position y_{6+k}.\n\nAt k=0, τ=6, y=3\n\nAt k=1, τ=7, y= y after first action, etc.\n\nAt k=5, τ=11, y must be in {0,1,2}\n\nAt k=6, τ=12, y must be in {0,1,2}\n\nNow, at some k=H, y_H=9.\n\nFrom k=6, y_6 <=2, to y_H=9, so H-6 >=7, so H >=13, since need to increase by at least 7, each step max +1.\n\ny_6 <=2, y_H=9, so y_H - y_6 >=7, and since each step changes by at most 1, H-6 >=7, so H >=13.\n\nThen at k=13, y_13=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so at time k=H, after H actions, position.\n\nWith H=13, k=13, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to have y_5 in {0,1,2} and y_6 in {0,1,2}\n\nFrom k=0 to k=5, 5 actions, from y=3 to y_5 <=2.\n\nSo we need to decrease by at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, from k=5 to k=6, one action, y_6 = y_5 + Δy5, so if y_5 in {0,1,2}, y_6 can be in {0,1,2,3} depending on action, but must be in {0,1,2}, so we cannot go up if y_5=2, must stay or down; if y_5=1, can go down to 0, stay at 1, or up to 2; if y_5=0, can stay or up to 1.\n\nSo y_6 can be controlled to be in {0,1,2}.\n\nThen from k=6 to k=13, 7 actions, to go from y_6 <=2 to y_13=9, so need exactly +7, so all U actions, no D or S.\n\nSince y_6 <=2, y_13=9, difference 7, 7 actions, so all must be U, and y must increase by 1 each step, so y_6 must be exactly 2, then y_7=3, y_8=4, ..., y_13=9.\n\nIf y_6=1, then to y_13=9, need +8 in 7 steps, impossible; similarly if y_6=0, need +9 in 7 steps impossible.

a6 to a18 is 13 actions: indices from 6 to 18 inclusive is 13 actions.\n\nτ=6 to τ=18, 13 actions, arrive at τ=19.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, with t1=6.\n\nSo actions: a6, a7, ..., a_{6+H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, at time 6+H, y=9.\n\nHere, after 13 actions, at time 6+13=19, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for the first 4 actions, S (at τ=6,7,8,9)\n\nThen at τ=10, D\n\nThen at τ=11, S\n\nThen at τ=12 to τ=18, U each.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut can we reduce H?\n\nFor example, instead of staying at 3, we can go up first, then down, but since we need to be at y=2 at τ=11, and we start at 3, we can go up to 4 or 5, but then we need to come down, which might require more down actions, so net, to reach y=2 at τ=11, with net change -1 from start, so if we go up, we need to come down more, so it might not save actions.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=6, U to y7=4\n\nThen stay or something, but to reach y11=2, from y7=4, need to decrease to 2 in 4 steps, so net -2, so more down actions.\n\nThen from lower position, need more up later.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, the above with minimal down and stay is better.\n\nWe can have y11=2 with fewer S.\n\nFor example, from y6=3, directly D at some point.\n\nBut with 5 actions to set y11.\n\ny11 = y6 + sum_{i=6 to 10} Δa_i = 3 + (U-D over 5 actions)\n\nSet equal to 2, so U-D = -1.\n\nSo number of D = number of U +1.\n\nWith 5 actions, possible, e.g., four S and one D, or three S, one D, one U, etc., but net D one more than U.\n\nBut since we need to go up later, extra U or D doesn't help, so having S is fine, as in the first plan.\n\nIn the action sequence, we can have different, but H is the same.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, we have 4 S, then one D, then one S, then 7 U, total actions 4+1+1+7=13.\n\nWe can combine the S at τ=11 with the previous.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in this sequence, at τ=10, we do D, but row at τ=10 is y=3, which is safe, and we go to y=2 at τ=11.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=1 or 0, but then need more up actions.\n\nSo y=2 is best.\n\nSimilarly for y12=2.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need the actions from turn t1=6.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter Turn 18 action, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go to y=9 after τ=12.\n\nFor example, at τ=12, if we can be at y=9, but impossible as before.\n\nOr at τ=13.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at τ=13, need y12=8, but at τ=12, y=8 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 1 or 2 at τ=11 and 12, but start from higher and come down faster.\n\nBut from high, it takes more down actions to reach low, so net worse.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=6, U to 4\n\nThen U to 5 at τ=7\n\nU to 6 at τ=8\n\nThen need to go down to 2 at τ=11.\n\nFrom y8=6 to y11=2 in 3 actions: need net -4, impossible, max decrease 3 to y=3.\n\nCannot reach y=2.\n\nIf at τ=8, y=5, then to y11=2, need -3 in 3 actions, possible: D,D,D to y11=2.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=4? Let's see:\n\nτ=6: y=3, a6=U, y7=4\n\nτ=7: y=4, a7=U, y8=5\n\nτ=8: y=5, a8=D, y9=4\n\nτ=9: y=4, a9=D, y10=3\n\nτ=10: y=3, a10=D, y11=2\n\nThen at τ=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a11=S, y12=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, same as before, 7 U to y19=9.\n\nBut now actions: a6=U, a7=U, a8=D, a9=D, a10=D, a11=S, then a12 to a18 U.\n\nCompared to previous, we used U,U,D,D,D,S then 7U, total actions 6 +7=13, same H.\n\nBut we were at higher y earlier, but still arrive at same time.\n\nIn terms of turns, same.\n\nBut in this sequence, we had to go down multiple times.\n\nIn the first sequence, we stayed then one down.\n\nBut H same.\n\nNow, back to the car on row 1 and 2, but we didn't use them.\n\nPerhaps we can go to row 1 or 2 earlier to save, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=11 and 12, we need to be on 0,1,2, and rows 1 and 2 are safe, we can be on them.\n\nBut in the path, we are on row 2 at τ=11 and 12.\n\nNow, to output the sequence.\n\nBut the minimal H is 13.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=12.\n\nSuppose H=12, arrive at τ=18, y=9.\n\nThen actions from τ=6 to τ=17.\n\nAt τ=11, k=5, must be safe, y in 0,1,2.\n\nAt τ=12, k=6, y in 0,1,2.\n\nFrom y at τ=12 <=2 to y at τ=18=9, need +7 in 6 steps (actions τ=12 to 17), impossible, max +6, to y=8 at τ=18 if y12=2.\n\nBut we need y=9.\n\nIf y12=1, to y=9 in 6 steps max y=7, etc.\n\nCannot.\n\nThus H=13 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence as above.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nFirst, H=13.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter Turn 18 action, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=18, which is t1 to t1+12, so t from 0 to 12, H=13 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut we can write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 11, we have S, which is fine.\n\nTo make y_12=2, we have S at turn 11.\n\nWe could have at turn 11, D to y=1, but then we need more up later, worse.\n\nSo this is fine.\n\nI think this is the minimal H and sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 13.

The current turn is t₁ = 7, and the player starts at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left by s per turn, and for right-moving cars, it moves right by s per turn. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is within its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move up or down at turn T, I'm still on y_T at turn T, and I move to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1. But the position update is immediate for collision purposes? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T. When I take an action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, so during turn T, I'm at y_T.\n\nThe player update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, position is y_t, and after action, it becomes y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, we check if 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway corresponding to y_T.\n\nAlso, if I change y at turn T, I'm not on the new y until turn T+1, so I don't check collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nNow, the cars are given for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at turn t₁=7.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -60, tail -25, left, speed 36. So it's moving left, so at any turn T, span is [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)] for left-moving. Head and tail: since it's left-moving, head is more negative? Let's see.\n\nIt says for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36). So at t₁, h = -60, τ = -25. Since it's left-moving, h should be the right end? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nBut if h and τ are positions, and it's left-moving, if h is head and τ is tail, for left-moving, head should be the left end? I think I need to interpret head and tail.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], which might be [left end, right end] or something. But for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be the front, which is left, so h should be smaller number.\n\nIn freeway 1: h = -60, τ = -25, so h = -60 is more negative, so left, and τ = -25 is less negative, so right. So [h, τ] = [-60, -25], meaning from -60 to -25, with -60 being head (left) and -25 tail (right). Since it's left-moving, the head is left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end? In the table, for freeway 3: (-24, -35, right, 6), but it says head h, tail τ, so for this car, h = -24, τ = -35? But τ = -35 is smaller, so left, h = -24 larger, so right. And direction right, so Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But the table says \"(-24, -35, right, 6)\", so it lists (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFrom the text:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t₁, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] and it moves left.\n\nIn freeway 1: left, h=-60, τ=-25, so [h,τ] = [-60,-25], so from x=-60 to x=-25, and since left-moving, head at -60 (left), tail at -25 (right).\n\nAt turn T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)] = [-60 - 36(T-7), -25 - 36(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] and moves right.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: first car (-24, -35, right, 6). Head h=-24, tail τ=-35. Since right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24], so from x=-35 to x=-24, head at -24 (right), tail at -35 (left).\n\nAt turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-35 + 6(T-7), -24 + 6(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, freeway 3 has three cars: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), and (18,7,right,6)\n\n(54,43,right,6): head=54, tail=43, so for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ,h] = [43,54]\n\nSimilarly, (18,7,right,6): head=18, tail=7, Span(t₁) = [7,18]\n\nAnd freeway 4 same as freeway 3: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: only (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 1: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nFreeway 2: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nAnd freeway 3 and 4 have three cars each.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn t=7.\n\nI need to get to y=9, which is the top, but y=9 is not a freeway, freeways are from 1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume no cars there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and collision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer position y_t must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9, so I need to increase y by 6, but I can go down or stay, but to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid collisions on the freeways.\n\nThe minimal number of turns without cars would be 6, all U actions, but I need to check if I can do that without colliding.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and I want to go to y=9, I need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8, each of which has cars.\n\nBut when I move, I am on a freeway only when I am at that y position during a turn.\n\nLet's think about the sequence.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I take action U at turn 7, then at turn 8, I am at y=4.\n\nSimilarly, if I take S, I stay at y=3, etc.\n\nCollision at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to know when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFor a given freeway, at turn T, if there is a car where 0 is within [low, high] of its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all.\n\nAlso, since the cars move, the span changes with time.\n\nLet me define T relative to t₁=7. Let τ = T - 7, so τ=0 at turn 7.\n\nThen for any turn T = 7 + τ, with τ >=0.\n\nNow for each freeway, I can find for which τ, position x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway at time τ.\n\nThat is, at turn T=7+τ, for freeway k, if there is a car such that 0 is in its Span(T).\n\nThen, if I am on freeway k at turn T, and for that k, 0 is covered at T, I collide.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, for freeways with multiple cars, I need to check each car.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, left-moving, s=36, h=-60, τ=-25 at τ=0 (T=7)\n\nSpan at time τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] = [-60 -36τ, -25 -36τ]\n\n0 is in span if -60 -36τ <= 0 <= -25 -36τ\n\nSince -60-36τ <= -25-36τ always, so 0 >= -60 -36τ and 0 <= -25 -36τ\n\nSo -60 -36τ <= 0 => -36τ <= 60 => τ >= -60/36? τ >=0, so -36τ <= 60 always true since τ>=0, left side negative.\n\n-60 -36τ <=0: since -36τ <=0, -60-36τ <= -60 <0, so always less than 0? Let's see:\n\n-60 -36τ <= 0 is true for all τ because left side negative.\n\nBut we need 0 <= -25 -36τ\n\n0 <= -25 -36τ\n\nWhich is -25 -36τ >=0\n\n-36τ >= 25\n\nMultiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36τ <= -25\n\nBut τ >=0, 36τ >=0, -25<0, so 36τ <= -25 is impossible.\n\nThus, 0 <= -25 -36τ is false for all τ >=0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span, so no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time.\n\nIs that right?\n\nSpan: [-60 -36τ, -25 -36τ]\n\nSince τ >=0, -36τ <=0, so lower bound <= -60 <0, upper bound = -25 -36τ <= -25 <0, so both ends negative, so 0 is always greater than upper bound, so never in span. Yes, so freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is the same car: (-60,-25,left,36), so same as above, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nHead h=-24, tail τ=-35? In table it's (head, tail), so head=-24, tail=-35, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at τ=0.\n\nAt time τ, Span(T) = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-35 + 6τ, -24 + 6τ]\n\ns=6, T-t₁=τ.\n\n0 in span if -35 +6τ <= 0 <= -24 +6τ\n\nWhich is -35 +6τ <=0 and 0 <= -24 +6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +6τ <=0 => 6τ <=35 => τ <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +6τ => 6τ >=24 => τ >=4\n\nSo for τ between 4 and 5.833, inclusive? Since positions, probably integers, but τ is turn offset, integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ = T - t₁, integer >=0.\n\nSo τ >=0 integer.\n\nSo τ >=4 and τ <=5.833, so τ=4,5\n\nτ=4: 6*4=24, so -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, since <= and >=, inclusive.\n\nSimilarly τ=5: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nτ=6: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: -35+18= -17, -24+18= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for first car, 0 occupied at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (54,43,right,6)\n\nHead=54, tail=43, direction right.\n\nSpan(t₁) = [τ, h] = [43,54]\n\nAt τ, [43 +6τ, 54 +6τ]\n\n0 in span? 43+6τ <=0 <=54+6τ\n\nBut 43+6τ >=43>0 for τ>=0, so 0 <= 43+6τ always true, but 43+6τ <=0 false, so never. Thus 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (18,7,right,6)\n\nHead=18, tail=7, direction right.\n\nSpan(t₁) = [7,18]\n\nAt τ, [7+6τ, 18+6τ]\n\nAll positive, 7+6τ >=7>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for freeway 3, only the first car covers 0, at τ=4 and τ=5, i.e., turns T=7+4=11 and T=7+5=12.\n\nAt τ=4, T=11; τ=5, T=12.\n\nNow freeway 4 same as freeway 3, since same cars: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nSo similarly, only the first car affects, 0 covered at τ=4 and τ=5, T=11 and 12.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car (-24,-35,right,6), same as above, 0 covered at τ=4,5, T=11,12.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, only that car, 0 at τ=4,5.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-24,-35,right,6), 0 at τ=4,5.\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-24,-35,right,6), 0 at τ=4,5.\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 are always safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, freeways 3 to 8 all have the same car that covers x=0 at turns T=11 and T=12.\n\nT=11 and 12 correspond to τ=4 and 5.\n\nt₁=7, so T=7+4=11, 7+5=12.\n\nBut for freeway 3 and 4, there are other cars, but they don't cover 0, so only this car matters.\n\nNow, so for each freeway from 3 to 8, at T=11 and T=12, if I am on that freeway, I collide.\n\nFor other times, no collision on these freeways.\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 are always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at turn 7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go all up, from y=3 to y=9, I need 6 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U, but let's see the positions over time.\n\nAt turn 7: position y=3\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and 0 covered at t.\n\nNow, for going all up:\n\nSuppose I take U at each turn starting from t=7.\n\nTurn 7: at y=3, take U, so y8 =4\n\nTurn 8: at y=4, take U, y9=5\n\nTurn 9: at y=5, take U, y10=6\n\nTurn 10: at y=6, take U, y11=7\n\nTurn 11: at y=7, take U, y12=8\n\nTurn 12: at y=8, take U, y13=9\n\nNow, at turn 13, y=9, which is goal.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some turn, and we reach it at turn 13, position (0,9).\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt each turn, we check if collision occurs.\n\nTurn 7: y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: at turn T=7, τ=0.\n\nWe have cars, but for freeway 3, at τ=0, first car span [-35,-24], 0 not in, others not, so safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=8, τ=1.\n\nFor freeway 4, the critical car: at τ=1, span [-35+6*1, -24+6*1] = [-29,-18], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt T=9, τ=2.\n\nFreeway 5 car: [-35+12, -24+12]? τ=2, s=6, [ -35 + 6*2, -24 +6*2] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nT=10, τ=3.\n\nCar: [-35 +18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nT=11, τ=4.\n\nCar: [-35 + 24, -24 + 24] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included, so if I am on freeway 7 at turn 11, and 0 in span, collision.\n\nBut at turn 11, I am at y=7, which is freeway 7, and 0 covered, so collision! Oh, problem.\n\nSimilarly, turn 12: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nT=12, τ=5.\n\nCar: [-35 + 30, -24 + 30] = [-5,6], 0 in it, collision.\n\nSo in the all-up plan, at turn 11 and 12, I collide on freeways 7 and 8.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI need to not be on freeways 7 or 8 at turns 11 and 12, or more generally, not on any freeway from 3 to 8 at turns 11 and 12, but since I'm moving up, I will be on different freeways.\n\nAt turn 11, if I am not on y=7, and at turn 12 not on y=8.\n\nBut I need to get to y=9.\n\nSince freeways 1 and 2 are always safe, I could stay there or go down, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nI could delay or advance my movement.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at a different time, not turn 11.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe danger times are only T=11 and 12 for freeways 3-8.\n\nAt other times, all freeways are safe.\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 are always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on any of y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turns 11 and 12.\n\nBut y=3,4,5,6 are only dangerous at T=11 and 12 if I am on them, but for y=3 to 6, at T=11 and 12, if I am on them, but let's see.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: dangerous at T=11 and 12? Earlier we have for freeway 3, 0 covered at T=11 and 12.\n\nSimilarly for all freeways 3 to 8.\n\nAt T=11 and 12, for any freeway k from 3 to 8, if I am on it, I collide, because 0 is covered.\n\nFor freeways 1 and 2, always safe, so if I am on y=1 or 2 at any time, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9, I need to pass through the freeways.\n\nThe critical turns are 11 and 12.\n\nI need to not be on any freeway from 3 to 8 at turns 11 and 12.\n\nThat means, at turn 11, I must be on y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nSimilarly at turn 12, on y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut since I start at y=3 at turn 7, and I need to reach y=9, which is above.\n\ny=9 is safe, but I need to be there.\n\nNow, turns: let me list the turns from 7 onwards.\n\nAt turn 7: y=3\n\nI need to avoid being on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn 11 and turn 12.\n\nTurn 11 is 4 turns after turn 7? Turn 7 to 11: turns 7,8,9,10,11, so 5 turns, but position changes.\n\nSince I have to be at safe positions at turn 11 and 12, and I start at turn 7.\n\nThe time from turn 7 to turn 11 is 4 steps: from t=7 to t=8,9,10,11.\n\nIn 4 actions, I can change y by at most 4, but I can stay or go down.\n\nAt turn 7, y=3.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 7+k, y position.\n\nI need for turn 11, which is turn 7+4, y_{11} must be in {0,1,2,9}\n\nSimilarly for turn 12, turn 7+5, y_{12} in {0,1,2,9}\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if I can reach y=9 by turn 11, then at turn 11 I am at y=9, safe, and similarly for turn 12.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=3, I need at least 6 up actions, so in 4 turns, I can at best go to y=3+4=7, not to 9.\n\nMinimum turns to reach y=9: from y=3, I need +6, so 6 actions, reaching at turn 7+6=13, as before.\n\nAt turn 11, which is earlier, I can be at most y=3+4=7 if all up, or less.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, which is dangerous at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at turn 12 dangerous.\n\nBut if I can be at y=1 or 2 or 0 at turn 11 and 12, that might be safe.\n\nFor example, I could go down to y=0,1,2 and wait there during the dangerous turns.\n\nBut y=0,1,2 are safe.\n\nThen after turn 12, I can go up.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nSince the danger is only at turns 11 and 12, I need to be safe at those two turns.\n\nAt other turns, I can be on any freeway except at the danger times.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to have increased y by 6 eventually.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, D decreases, S no change.\n\nNet change must be +6.\n\nThe number of turns H is from turn t1 to when I reach y=9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at y=9, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nLet's see: at turn t, before action, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at turn t1=7, y=3.\n\nI take actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, I should be at y=9.\n\nFor example, if I take no action, at turn t1, y=3, not 9.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t1+1, y could be 2,3,4.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, I need to have taken actions such that after the actions, y_T =9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nAnd T - t1 should be minimized, but H is the number of actions, so from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" means at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is updated to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBecause y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t1, start with y_{t1} =3.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} set, and so on, up to after action a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nSo at turn t1+H, position y=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach is turn t1+H.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and we reach at turn t1+H.\n\nFor example, all up: actions at t=7 to t=12 (6 actions), y_{13}=9, reached at turn 13.\n\nH=6, reached at turn 7+6=13.\n\nMinimal H without obstacles would be 6.\n\nBut with obstacles, we need to avoid collision during the path.\n\nCollision can happen at any turn from t1 to when we reach, but we might reach before or after.\n\nIn this case, since we need to go through freeways, collision during the journey.\n\nAt each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, we are at some position, and we might collide if on dangerous freeway at that time.\n\nAt turn t1+H, we are at y=9, safe, no collision there.\n\nSo for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, we must not collide.\n\nIn the all-up plan, H=6, turns 7 to 12, we collide at turn 11 and 12.\n\nNow back to avoiding the danger.\n\nDanger at turns 11 and 12 for freeways 3-8.\n\nTurn 11 is t1+4, turn 12 is t1+5.\n\nt1=7, so turn 11=7+4, turn 12=7+5.\n\nAt turn 11, I must not be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8; so must be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nSimilarly at turn 12, not on y=3-8; so on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if I can be at y=9 by turn 11, that would be great, but from y=3 at turn 7 to y=9 at turn 11, I need to increase by 6 in 4 steps (from turn 7 to 11, actions at t=7,8,9,10, 4 actions, to reach y_{11}=9? After 4 actions, y_{11} = y_{7} + sum Δy from t=7 to 10.\n\nAt turn 7, y7=3.\n\nAfter a7, y8\n\nAfter a8, y9\n\nAfter a9, y10\n\nAfter a10, y11\n\nSo to have y11=9, I need to go from y7=3 to y11=9, so +6 in 4 actions.\n\nEach U gives +1, D gives -1, S 0.\n\nNet sum of Δy must be +6.\n\nBut with 4 actions, the maximum I can increase is +4, if all U.\n\ny11 = y7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y11 <= 3 +4 =7 <9, cannot reach y=9 in 4 actions from y=3.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12: y12 = y7 + Δy7 to Δy11, 5 actions, y12 <= 3+5=8<9, still not 9.\n\ny12 <=8 with 5 actions, or if all U, y12=3+5=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need at least 6 actions, reaching at turn 13.\n\nSo at turn 11 and 12, I cannot be at y=9, since earliest at turn 13.\n\nTherefore, at turn 11, I must be on y=0,1, or 2.\n\nSimilarly at turn 12, on y=0,1, or 2.\n\ny=1 and 2 are freeways but safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=0,1,2 at turn 11 and at turn 12.\n\nThen after that, I can go to y=9.\n\nBut at turn 12, I am at safe y, then I need to go up to 9.\n\nNow, let me denote the turns.\n\nLet t be absolute turn.\n\nt=7: y=3\n\nI need to have y_{11} in {0,1,2} and y_{12} in {0,1,2}\n\ny_{11} is position at turn 11.\n\ny_{12} position at turn 12.\n\nFrom y7 to y11: 4 actions, a7 to a10.\n\ny11 = y7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 = 3 + sum_{t=7 to10} Δy_t\n\nSimilarly, y12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nSince y11 in {0,1,2}, and y12 in {0,1,2}, so |y12 - y11| <=1, since one action.\n\nNow, after that, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny12 in {0,1,2}, to y=9, I need to increase by at least 7, at most 9, so at least 7 actions from there, but I can take multiple actions.\n\nThe reaching turn: I need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nWith y12 at low, I need to go up.\n\nTo minimize H, I should minimize the time to reach y=9.\n\nBut I have to spend the dangerous turns at safe y.\n\nThe dangerous turns are fixed: 11 and 12.\n\nI need to be safe at t=11 and t=12.\n\nThen from t=12 onwards, I can go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at t=12, I am at y12 in {0,1,2}, then I need to reach y=9.\n\nEach U increases by 1, so from y=0, I need 9 U actions to reach y=9 at turn t=12 +9 =21, too late.\n\nBut that can't be minimal.\n\nI can be at higher y before t=11, but I have to be at safe y at t=11 and 12.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=7 or 8 before t=11, but at t=11 I need to be low.\n\nThen after t=12, go up.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nt=7: y=3\n\nI can take actions to be at y=0,1,2 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly at t=12.\n\nNow, the net change from t=7 to t=11 must be such that y11 = 3 + sum_{t=7 to10} Δy_t <=2, since y11<=2, and y11 >=0.\n\nSimilarly, y12 = y11 + Δy11, and y12 in {0,1,2}, so Δy11 can be -1,0,1.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should reach y=9 as soon as possible after t=12.\n\nSo I should be as high as possible at t=12, so y12=2, then from there, I need 7 U actions to reach y=9 at turn t=12+7=19.\n\ny12=2, after 7 U, y19=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y12=1, need 8 U, y20=9, worse.\n\ny12=0, need 9 U, y21=9, worse.\n\nSo best to have y12=2.\n\nThen y11 must be such that y12= y11 + Δy11, and y12=2, so if y11=2, then Δy11=S or D, but if S, y12=2, if D, y12=1<2, not good.\n\nIf y11=1, then Δy11=U to y12=2.\n\nIf y11=0, Δy11=U to y12=1, not 2.\n\nTo have y12=2, possible with:\n\n- y11=2 and Δy11=S, then y12=2\n\n- or y11=1 and Δy11=U, y12=2\n\n- or y11=2 and Δy11=D, y12=1, not 2\n\n- etc, so only two cases: either (y11=2 and a11=S) or (y11=1 and a11=U)\n\nSimilarly, y11 must be in {0,1,2}, but for y12=2, y11 must be 1 or 2.\n\nNow, from start, y7=3.\n\nTo have y11 <=2, and y11 >=1 or 2? y11 can be 1 or 2 for efficiency.\n\ny11 = 3 + sum_{t=7 to10} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo to have y11 <=2, since y7=3, I need at least one net down or stay, but to have y11=1 or 2.\n\nFor example, if I go down or stay in some actions.\n\nBut to reach y=9 fast, I should not go down too much, but I have to for the constraint.\n\nAfter y12=2, I go all up, so the time from t=12 to reach y=9 is 7 turns: actions at t=12 to t=18, y19=9.\n\nH= number of actions from t=7 to t=18? Actions at t=7 to t=18 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=18, that's 12 actions? t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, that's 12 actions.\n\nAfter a18, y19=9.\n\nReached at turn 19.\n\nBut earlier without obstacle, turn 13, so later.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by being higher before t=11.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=10, I am at high y, but at t=11 I need to be low, so I might go down at t=10 or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nThe dangerous turns are only 11 and 12, so at other turns, I can be on high freeways.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=8 at turn 10, which is safe, then at turn 10, if I take D, then at turn 11, y11=7, but y=7 at turn 11 is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at turn 10, y10=8, take D, y11=7, but t=11, y=7, dangerous.\n\nIf I take S at turn 10, y11=8, but y=8 at t=11, dangerous? Turn 11, if y=8, freeway 8, which is dangerous at t=11.\n\nAll freeways 3-8 dangerous at t=11.\n\nSo if I am on y=3-8 at t=11, collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=12.\n\nSo at t=11, I must be on y=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly t=12.\n\nNow, to be on y=2 at t=12, for example.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=7, I can go down to y=2 quickly and wait, but then I have to go up later.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimal H.\n\nSince I have to be at low y at t=11 and t=12, and then go up, the earliest I can reach y=9 is after t=12.\n\nWith y12=2, then 7 ups, reach at t=19.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at y=2 at t=11 and stay or something.\n\nAnother idea: I could be at y=9 before t=11, but as we saw, impossible, since at t=10, y10 <= 3+3=6 if all up from t=7, but y7=3, after 3 actions (t=7,8,9), y10 = y7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 <= 3+3=6, so at t=10, y10<=6, not 9.\n\nCannot reach before t=11.\n\nt=11 is the earliest dangerous turn, but I can't be at 9 before.\n\nSo I must be at safe zone at t=11 and t=12.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut with y12=2, reach at t=19.\n\nBut that seems late. Perhaps I can reduce the time by not going all the way down.\n\ny12=2 is the highest I can be at t=12 in safe zone.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 faster by using the safe freeways at other times.\n\nFor example, freeways 1 and 2 are always safe, so I can move on them freely.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are below, I need to go up to 9.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, I need to go through y=3 to 8, which are dangerous at t=11 and 12, but at other times safe.\n\nSo if I can be on y=3 to 8 at times other than t=11 and 12, I can.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=8 before t=11, but at t=11 I need to be low, so I have to go down or something.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nTurns: 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,...\n\nAt t=7, y=3\n\nI need to avoid y=3-8 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nSo for t=11, y11 not in 3-8, so y11 in 0,1,2\n\nSimilarly for t=12, y12 in 0,1,2\n\nNow, between t=7 and t=10, I can be on any y, including high, as long as at t=11 I am low.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, I am low.\n\nThen after t=12, I can go up.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I can be at high y, say y=8, which is safe at t=10, since t=10 is not 11 or 12.\n\nThen at t=10, I take action to go down, but if I take D, y11=7, which is dangerous at t=11.\n\nIf I take S, y11=8, dangerous.\n\nIf I take U, y11=9, but y=9 not freeway, safe, but from y=8, U to y=9.\n\nAt turn t=10, if I am at y=8, and I take U, then at turn t=11, I am at y=9, which is safe, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen at t=11, I am at y=9, goal reached? But at t=11, position y11=9.\n\nIf I can be at y=9 at t=11, then I reached at turn 11.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=7, to y=9 at t=11, with 4 actions: a7 to a10.\n\ny11 = y7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 = 3 + sum of 4 Δy\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y11 <= 3+4=7 <9, impossible.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by t=11.\n\nSimilarly, not by t=12.\n\nEarliest at t=13 with 6 actions.\n\nBut at t=13, y=9, safe.\n\nThe problem is the path to get there, avoiding collision at intermediate turns.\n\nAt t=11 and t=12, if I am on freeway 3-8, I collide.\n\nIn the all-up plan, I am on y=7 at t=11 and y=8 at t=12, both dangerous.\n\nSo I need to not be on those y at those times.\n\nFor example, at t=11, I could be on y=2, safe.\n\nBut to do that, I need to go down first.\n\nThen from there go up, but it takes time.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=1 or 2 at t=11 and t=12, then go up.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by t=13 with a different sequence.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I need to be at a position such that after action, I am safe at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for t=12.\n\nSuppose at t=10, I am at y=2, for example.\n\nThen at t=10, I can take S, so y11=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, I take S, y12=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=12, I start going up.\n\nBut y12=2, then I need to go to y=9, so actions U from t=12 to t=18, y19=9.\n\nReached at t=19.\n\nBut from t=7 to t=10, I need to get to y=2.\n\ny7=3, to y10=2, for example.\n\nWith 3 actions: a7,a8,a9.\n\ny10 = y7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nSet to 2.\n\nSo 3 + sum Δy =2, so sum Δy = -1.\n\nFor example, one D and two S, or one D, one U, one D, etc, net -1.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=2, take S, y11=2.\n\nt=11, take S, y12=2.\n\nThen t=12, take U, y13=3\n\nt=13, U, y14=4\n\n...\nup to t=18, U, y19=9.\n\nMany turns.\n\nBut I can be higher at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I can be at y=6, safe since t=10 not dangerous.\n\nThen at t=10, if I take D, y11=5, but y=5 at t=11 is dangerous, since freeway 5, dangerous at t=11.\n\nIf I take U, y11=7, dangerous.\n\nIf I take S, y11=6, dangerous.\n\nAll dangerous because y=6 at t=11 is on freeway 6, which is dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3-8 at t=10 if I take an action that keeps me there or moves to another dangerous y.\n\nThe only way to be safe at t=11 is to be on y=0,1,2 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for t=12.\n\nSo at t=10, I must take an action that puts me to y=0,1,2 at t=11.\n\nFor example, if at t=10 I am at y=2, take S, y11=2.\n\nIf at t=10 I am at y=3, take D, y11=2.\n\nIf at t=10 I am at y=1, take S, y11=1, etc.\n\nSimilarly, to be safe at t=11, y11 must be 0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly for t=12.\n\nNow, to have y12 in 0,1,2, and y11 in 0,1,2.\n\nFor fast ascent, I should be as high as possible at t=12, so y12=2.\n\nThen from t=12, go all U to y=9.\n\nNow, y12=2, so I need 7 U actions to reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut how to have y12=2 with y11 in 0,1,2.\n\nAs before, y11=2 and a11=S, or y11=1 and a11=U.\n\nNow, y11 depends on previous.\n\ny7=3.\n\nLet's list the actions from t=7 to t=11.\n\nLet S_t be the position at turn t.\n\nS7 =3\n\na7: action at t=7, S8 = S7 + Δy7\n\na8: S9 = S8 + Δy8\n\na9: S10 = S9 + Δy9\n\na10: S11 = S10 + Δy10\n\nWe need S11 in {0,1,2}\n\nThen a11: S12 = S11 + Δy11\n\nWe need S12 in {0,1,2}, and specifically for y12=2, S12=2.\n\nThen from t=12, actions a12 to a18, all U, S13=3, S14=4, ..., S19=9.\n\nReached at turn 19.\n\nH= number of actions from t=7 to t=18 inclusive? Actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: that's 12 actions.\n\nt=7 to t=18 is 12 turns, 12 actions.\n\nBut t=7 to t=18 is 12 actions? Let's count: t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: 12 actions, S19=9.\n\nBut we can reduce H by having S12=2 but with fewer actions to get there.\n\nFrom S7=3 to S11 in {0,1,2}, with 4 actions (a7 to a10).\n\nThe net change must be S11 - S7 <=2-3= -1 or to 0-3= -3, or 1-3= -2,2-3= -1.\n\nSo S11 <=2, S7=3, so net change <= -1.\n\nWith 4 actions, I can have net change from -4 to +4.\n\nTo have S11=2, net change -1.\n\nSimilarly, S11=1, net change -2, etc.\n\nFor S12=2, with S11=2 and a11=S, or S11=1 and a11=U.\n\nIn the first case, a11=S, no change.\n\nIn second, a11=U, +1.\n\nTo minimize time, I should have S11 as high as possible, so S11=2.\n\nThen S12=2 with a11=S.\n\nThen from S12=2, go up.\n\nS11=2 with net change -1 from S7=3 in 4 actions.\n\nFor example, three S and one D, or two S, one U, one D, etc., net -1.\n\nThen S11=2.\n\na11=S, S12=2.\n\nThen a12 to a18 all U, S13=3 to S19=9.\n\n7 actions from a12 to a18.\n\nTotal actions: a7 to a18, 12 actions.\n\nBut a7 to a10: 4 actions, a11: one, a12 to a18: 7, total 12 actions.\n\nReached at turn 19.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at S12=2, but with S11=1 and a11=U.\n\nThen S11=1, which requires net change from S7=3 to S11=1, net -2 in 4 actions.\n\nFor example, two D and two S, or one D, two S, one D, etc.\n\nThen S11=1, a11=U, S12=2.\n\nThen same as above, S12=2, go up to S19=9.\n\nBut S11=1 is lower than S11=2, so same number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier but avoid the danger times.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 1 and 2 are safe, I can go to y=2 at some point and wait, but I need to go up later.\n\nBut let's see if I can be on y=8 at t=10, safe, then at t=10, I take an action to go to safe y at t=11.\n\nBut from y=8, the only way to be safe at t=11 is to go to y=9, but from y=8, U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut y=9 at t=11 is safe, but as we saw, I cannot reach y=8 at t=10 from y=3 at t=7 with 3 actions.\n\nS7=3, after a7,a8,a9, S10 = 3 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 <= 3+3=6, so S10<=6, cannot be 8.\n\nMax S10=6 if all U.\n\nS10=6.\n\nAt t=10, S10=6.\n\nNow, to be safe at t=11, S11 must be in 0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut S11 = S10 + Δy10.\n\nS10=6, Δy10 in {-1,0,1}, so S11=5,6, or 7.\n\nAll of which are in 3-8, so on freeway, and dangerous at t=11, so collision.\n\nIf I take U, S11=7, dangerous.\n\nD, S11=5, dangerous.\n\nS, S11=6, dangerous.\n\nNo way to be safe from S10=6.\n\nSimilarly, if S10=5, S11=4,5,6 all dangerous.\n\nS10=4, S11=3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nS10=3, S11=2,3,4; 2 is safe, 3 and 4 dangerous.\n\nSo only if S11=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, S10=2, S11=1,2,3; 1 and 2 safe, 3 dangerous.\n\nS10=1, S11=0,1,2 all safe.\n\nS10=0, S11=0,1 safe,  -1 invalid, y>=0.\n\nSo to have S11 safe, I need S11 in 0,1,2.\n\nFrom S10, if S10 <=2, I can choose Δy10 to make S11 in 0,1,2.\n\nIf S10=3, I can make S11=2 with D.\n\nIf S10=4 or higher, I cannot make S11 in 0,1,2 with one action.\n\nSimilarly for S12.\n\nBut S12 depends on S11.\n\nFor S11 to be in 0,1,2, S10 must be at most 3, so that I can go down to 2.\n\nWith S7=3, S10 <=6, so to have S10 <=3, I need net down or stay in the first three actions.\n\nFor example, to have S10=3, then at t=10, take D, S11=2.\n\nThen S11=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, I need S12 in 0,1,2, and for efficiency, S12=2.\n\nSo at t=11, take S, S12=2.\n\nThen from t=12, go up.\n\nS10=3, how to have.\n\nS7=3, S10 = 3 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nSet to 3, so sum Δy7 to Δy9 =0.\n\nFor example, all S, or U and D, etc.\n\nThen S10=3.\n\na10=D, S11=2.\n\na11=S, S12=2.\n\nThen a12 to a18 U, S19=9.\n\nActions: t=7 to t=18, 12 actions.\n\nS10=3 with net 0 in three actions.\n\nCan I have S10 higher? S10=4, but then I cannot make S11 safe, as above.\n\nS10=4, S11 must be 3,4,5, all dangerous.\n\nSimilarly S10=5 or 6, worse.\n\nSo S10 must be at most 3 to be able to go to safe S11.\n\nSimilarly, if I have S10=2, then at t=10, I can take S or U or D to have S11=2,1, or 3, but S11=3 dangerous, so take S to S11=2 or D to S11=1 or U to S11=3 dangerous, so I can take S or D to have S11=2 or 1.\n\nThen S11=2 or 1, safe.\n\nThen for S12, I can set to 2.\n\nFor example, S10=2, a10=S, S11=2, then a11=S, S12=2.\n\nOr S10=2, a10=D, S11=1, then a11=U, S12=2.\n\nBut S11=1 is lower, but same for later.\n\nTo have S10=2, from S7=3, net change -1 in three actions, for example one D and two S.\n\nThen S10=2.\n\na10=S, S11=2.\n\na11=S, S12=2.\n\nThen go up.\n\nStill reach at t=19.\n\nNo better.\n\nBut at t=12, S12=2, I go up, but I need to pass through freeways 3-8 after t=12.\n\nAfter t=12, the danger is over, since only t=11 and 12 are dangerous, other times safe.\n\nSo I can be on freeways 3-8 at other times without problem.\n\nFrom S12=2, I go up to y=9.\n\nS12=2 at t=12.\n\na12=U, S13=3\n\na13=U, S14=4\n\na14=U, S15=5\n\na15=U, S16=6\n\na16=U, S17=7\n\na17=U, S18=8\n\na18=U, S19=9\n\nSo S19=9, reached at turn 19.\n\nH=12 actions from t=7 to t=18.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=11, if I am at S11=2, I could take U at t=11, but S12=3, but at t=12, S12=3, which is freeway 3, dangerous at t=12, collision.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nAt t=11, I must have S12 in 0,1,2, so I cannot take U if it puts me to 3.\n\nSo I have to stay or go down at t=11 to be safe at t=12.\n\nThen after t=12, I can go up.\n\nSo I think 12 is the minimal with this approach.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach faster.\n\nSuppose at t=12, I am at S12=2, but instead of going directly up, I could have gone up before t=11 to some point, but I have to come down for t=11 and 12.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I am at S10=6 (all U from t=7), but then I cannot avoid collision at t=11.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on freeway 1 or 2 at t=11 and 12, which are safe, and those are higher than 0.\n\ny=2 is the highest safe at that time.\n\nBut y=2 is freeway 2, which is safe.\n\nFrom there to y=9, 7 steps.\n\nAnother thought: the player can move to y=9 at turn t=13 with 6 actions, but I need to avoid being on dangerous positions at t=11 and t=12.\n\nIn the path to y=9 at t=13, the positions at t=11 and t=12 must be safe.\n\nFor example, at t=11, S11 must be in 0,1,2, and at t=12, S12 in 0,1,2.\n\nBut to reach S13=9, S13 = S12 + Δy12.\n\nS12 in 0,1,2, Δy12 <=1, so S13 <=3, but 9>3, impossible to reach S13=9 from S12<=2.\n\nS13 = S12 + Δy12 <= 2+1=3 <9, so I cannot reach y=9 at t=13 if S12<=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, S12<=2, then S13<=3, S14<=4, etc., so to reach y=9, I need at least turn t=12 +7 =19 if S12=2.\n\nIf S12=1, t=20, etc.\n\nSo the earliest possible is turn 19 with S12=2.\n\nAnd to have S12=2 with the constraints.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut let's see the answer format, perhaps I can write the sequence.\n\nBut maybe there is a shorter way.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 13 by being on safe positions at t=11 and t=12.\n\nBut at t=11, if S11=9, but impossible as before.\n\nOr S11=2, but then S13 cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn 19.\n\nBut turn 19 seems late, and the cars move fast, but let's double-check the car positions.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, the danger is not at t=11 and 12.\n\nLet's list for each freeway when 0 is occupied.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 2: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: 0 occupied at τ=4 and 5, T=11 and 12.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 5: same car, T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nAll freeways 3-8 have danger at T=11 and 12 only.\n\nNo other times.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 3 and 4, there are other cars, but we saw they don't cover 0.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: second car (54,43,right,6), at τ, [43+6τ,54+6τ], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nThird car (18,7,right,6), [7+6τ,18+6τ], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4.\n\nSo only the first car matters for all.\n\nSo danger only at T=11 and 12.\n\nSo I think I have to avoid those freeways at those turns.\n\nMinimal H is 12, reached at turn 19.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFor example, one way: from t=7 to t=9, stay or move to have S10=3.\n\nFor example, all stay:\n\na7=S, S8=3\n\na8=S, S9=3\n\na9=S, S10=3\n\na10=D, S11=2  (safe, freeway 2)\n\na11=S, S12=2  (safe)\n\nThen a12=U, S13=3\n\na13=U, S14=4\n\na14=U, S15=5\n\na15=U, S16=6\n\na16=U, S17=7\n\na17=U, S18=8\n\na18=U, S19=9\n\nActions from t=7 to t=18: a7=S, a8=S, a9=S, a10=D, a11=S, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U.\n\n12 actions.\n\nBut I can reduce the stay actions.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I can go down to y=2 immediately.\n\na7=D, S8=2\n\nThen at t=8, S8=2, I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to be at safe y at t=11 and t=12.\n\nSince y=2 is safe, I can stay there.\n\na7=D, S8=2\n\na8=S, S9=2\n\na9=S, S10=2\n\na10=S, S11=2\n\na11=S, S12=2\n\nThen a12=U, S13=3\n\n... same as before, up to a18=U, S19=9.\n\nStill 12 actions.\n\nFrom S8=2, I could go up a bit but come back, but no point.\n\nTo have S12=2 with S11=1 and a11=U.\n\nFor example, a7=D, S8=2\n\na8=D, S9=1\n\na9=S, S10=1\n\na10=S, S11=1\n\na11=U, S12=2\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut S11=1, which is fine, but same number of actions.\n\nS12=2 at t=12, then 7 U to S19=9.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nStart turn t1=7.\n\nActions at t=7 to t=18, 12 actions.\n\nReached at turn t=19.\n\nThe sequence should be for t=7 to t=18.\n\nAnswer format: for each turn, the action.\n\nSo from turn 7 to turn 18.\n\nBut the sequence is given as Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up after t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, S12=2, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so when I move to y=9, at that turn, I am on the previous freeway until I move.\n\nFor example, when I take U from y=8 to y=9 at turn T, at turn T, I am at y=8, so on freeway 8, and collision if danger at T.\n\nBut after t=12, no danger, so safe.\n\nIn our case, from S12=2, I go to S13=3, etc., all safe after t=12.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut 12 turns seem long, but given the constraints, it might be necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 13 if I can be at safe positions at t=11 and t=12 with higher y, but impossible since safe only up to y=2.\n\nAnother idea: at t=11, if I am at y=2, and at t=12, I am at y=2, but then at t=12, I take U to y=3, but at t=12, if I am on y=3, and t=12 is dangerous for freeway 3, collision.\n\nSo I cannot move up at t=12 if it puts me on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time.\n\nSo I have to stay at safe y during danger times.\n\nAfter danger times, I can move.\n\nSo I think 12 is the best.\n\nBut let's see if I can have S12=2 with fewer actions or something.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps for the car on freeway 8, at t=12, but if I am not on it, etc.\n\nI think I have to accept H=12.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTo save actions, I can go down less.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I take U to y=4, but then I need to go down later.\n\nS7=3\n\na7=U, S8=4\n\na8=U, S9=5\n\na9=U, S10=6\n\nBut S10=6, then to have S11 safe, I need S11 in 0,1,2, but from S10=6, I can only go to 5,6,7, all dangerous, impossible.\n\nSo I must not go too high before t=10.\n\nSo I need to be at S10 <=3.\n\nFor example, S10=3.\n\nWith a7, a8, a9.\n\nIf I take some down, but net to S10=3.\n\nFor example, a7=S, S8=3\n\na8=S, S9=3\n\na9=S, S10=3\n\nThen a10=D, S11=2\n\na11=S, S12=2\n\nThen a12 to a18 U.\n\nBut a12 to a18 is 7 actions, but to reach S19=9, yes.\n\nNumber of actions: a7 to a18, 12.\n\nFrom t=7 to t=18, that's 12 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have S10=3 with only two actions, but no, three actions for a7,a8,a9 to set S10.\n\nS10 is after a9.\n\nActions a7,a8,a9 determine S10.\n\nThen a10 determines S11, etc.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the sequence, let's choose one.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 7: S  (y=3)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y=3)\n\nTurn 9: S  (y=3)\n\nTurn 10: D  (y=2 at t=11? At turn 10, action D, so S11 = S10 + (-1) = 3 -1 =2)\n\nPosition at turn: after action, but collision at turn based on position at that turn.\n\nTurn 10: at turn 10, position S10=3, freeway 3, and at t=10, τ=3, not dangerous, safe.\n\nAction a10=D, so S11=2.\n\nTurn 11: at turn 11, position S11=2, freeway 2, safe, since freeway 2 always safe.\n\nAction a11=S, so S12=2.\n\nTurn 12: position S12=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nAction a12=U, S13=3\n\nTurn 13: U, S14=4\n\nTurn 14: U, S15=5\n\nTurn 15: U, S16=6\n\nTurn 16: U, S17=7\n\nTurn 17: U, S18=8\n\nTurn 18: U, S19=9\n\nNow, at turn 19, S19=9, reached.\n\nAnd no collision: at turns 7 to 10, on freeway 3, not dangerous times.\n\nTurn 11 and 12 on freeway 2, safe.\n\nTurns 13 to 18 on freeway 3 to 8, but after t=12, no danger, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from turn 7 to turn 18, 12 actions.\n\nThe minimal number is 12.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with less by using the safe freeways earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I am at y=3, I can go down to y=2 immediately.\n\na7=D, S8=2\n\nThen at t=8, S8=2, I can stay or go up, but if I go up, I may be high at t=10, but I need to be low at t=11.\n\nSince y=2 is safe, I can stay.\n\na7=D, S8=2\n\na8=S, S9=2\n\na9=S, S10=2\n\na10=S, S11=2\n\na11=S, S12=2\n\nThen a12=U, S13=3\n\n... same as before, a18=U, S19=9\n\nSame number.\n\nAfter S8=2, I could go up to y=3 or 4 at t=9 or 10, but then I have to come down for t=11, so net loss.\n\nFor example, a7=D, S8=2\n\na8=U, S9=3\n\na9=U, S10=4\n\nThen at S10=4, I need to go to safe at t=11, but from y=4, I can go to y=3,4,5, all dangerous at t=11, cannot.\n\nSo I must go down, a10=D, S11=3, but y=3 at t=11 dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I cannot be high at t=10.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y<=3 at t=10 and go down to y=2 or 1 or 0 for t=11.\n\nThen stay safe for t=12.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=2 at t=11 and at t=12 take U to y=3, but at t=12, if S12=3, dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nMust stay at safe y during both turns.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turns after t=12, I go up, but I can start from t=12.\n\nIn the sequence above, from t=12 to t=18, I go up, but at t=12, S12=2, action U to S13=3, etc.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nThe minimal H is 12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 12: action U, to go to y=3 at turn 13.\n\nBut at turn 18, action U, to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nThe actions are from turn 7 to turn 18, 12 turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps I can have fewer stays.\n\nFor example, to have S10=3, I can have actions that net zero change in three actions.\n\nFor example, a7=U, S8=4\n\na8=D, S9=3\n\na9=S, S10=3\n\nThen a10=D, S11=2\n\na11=S, S12=2\n\nThen a12 to a18 U as before.\n\nSame H.\n\nNo reduction.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=11, if on freeway 7, span of car: for freeway 7, car (-24,-35,right,6), at T=11, τ=4, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so x=0 is included, yes.\n\nSimilarly at t=12, τ=5, [-35+30, -24+30]=[-5,6], 0 included.\n\nSo collision if on.\n\nNow, in our sequence, at t=11, we are at y=2, freeway 2, which has no car covering 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=12.\n\nSo ok.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nSequence as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is not on any freeway from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 11 and 12, when cars on these freeways cover position \\(x = 0\\). Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are always safe, as cars there never cover \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 7. To avoid the danger at turns 11 and 12, the player stays at \\(y = 3\\) until turn 10, then moves down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 11. The player remains at \\(y = 2\\) during turns 11 and 12 to stay safe. After turn 12, the player moves up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 19.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 7, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as turn 7 is not dangerous for freeway 3).\n- At turn 8, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe).\n- At turn 9, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe).\n- At turn 10, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 11 (freeway 2 is always safe).\n- At turn 11, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) (safe during dangerous turn 11).\n- At turn 12, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) (safe during dangerous turn 12).\n- From turns 13 to 18, move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) from 3 to 9, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. Freeways 3 to 8 are safe after turn 12, as the danger is only at turns 11 and 12.\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H\\) to 12 turns, with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 19.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 8, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway y_T. And importantly, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and I only enter y+1 at turn T+1. That means when I decide to move at turn T, I'm affected by the car on my current freeway y_T at turn T, but not by the car on the freeway I'm moving to until turn T+1.\n\nLet me denote the turn number relative to t_1. Let τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, we are at turn t_1=8, position y=3.\n\nI need to find actions for τ=0 to H-1 such that at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\ny_τ is the position at turn t_1 + τ.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy depending on action.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there. But I start at y=3, which has cars, and need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so I only need to worry about freeways 1 to 8 when I'm on them.\n\nBut when I'm on y=3 at turn τ, I need to avoid collision with cars on freeway 3 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at t_1=8.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars are given with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. For left-moving, head is the front, so if moving left, head decreases. For right-moving, head increases.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ I assume, since head and tail.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\n48 and 83, but if moving left, head at 48, tail at 83? That seems odd because if moving left, head should be larger than tail? I think I need to interpret head and tail.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ both decrease.\n\nBut in the span [h, τ], if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, if head is at higher x, tail at lower x, but when moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: h=48, τ=83? 48 and 83, if [h,τ] = [48,83], that would be from 48 to 83, but if moving left, it should be decreasing, so perhaps h is the left end or right end.\n\nI think there might be confusion in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\".\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83.\n\nNow, at t_1, span is [48,83]. Since it's moving left, at later time, both decrease, so the car is moving left.\n\nBut [48,83] means from x=48 to x=83? That seems like a car from 48 to 83, which is length 36? 83-48=35, not 36, close but not exact.\n\n83-48=35, but speed is 36, which is per turn? Speed might be in units per turn.\n\nPerhaps the car length is |h - τ| +1 or something.\n\nBut for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at a given turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says for right-moving, head at h, tail at τ, but span is [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFor left-moving car: head is at position h, tail at position τ, and since moving left, head is the front, so for left-moving, head should be at the higher x, tail at lower x? But in the span [h, τ], if h=48, τ=83, that would be [48,83], which if moving left, head at 83 might make sense, but it says head at h=48, which is smaller.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are misnomer or misdefined.\n\nLet's look at the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), span [48,83] at t_1.\n\nAt time T, [48 - 36(T-t_1), 83 - 36(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor freeway 3: three cars, e.g. (-18,-29,right,6), span [τ, h] = [-29, -18]? No.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so for this car, τ= -18, h= -29? That can't be, because τ should be tail, h head, but -18 and -29, with -29 < -18, so if [τ,h] = [-18,-29], that would be empty or negative span.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nLet's read the car state carefully.\n\nFor freeway k, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for freeway 3: \"(-18, -29, right, 6)\" so head h = -18, tail τ = -29, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h], so [τ, h] = [-29, -18]? -29 to -18, which is from left to right since -29 < -18.\n\nBut head at h=-18, which is the right end, tail at τ=-29, left end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 1: head h=48, tail τ=83, span [h, τ] = [48,83], so from 48 to 83, head at 48? If moving left, head should be at 83, but it says head at 48, so perhaps \"head\" is defined as the leading end when moving.\n\nFor left-moving, leading end is smaller x if x increases to the right, but let's assume x increases to the right.\n\nStandard: x increases to the right.\n\nSo for left-moving car, it moves to decreasing x, so head (front) is at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nFor example, car at positions from x_low to x_high, with x_high head for left-moving.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving: (h, τ, left, s) with span [h, τ], and since moving left, h should be the higher x, τ lower x? But in freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, 48<83, so if [48,83], τ=83 is higher, so head should be at 83, but it says head at h=48, which is lower, contradiction.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or mislabel.\n\nLet's look at the span update.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] at t_1, then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so both decrease, so the car moves left.\n\nIf at t_1, [48,83], then at T, it shifts left by sΔT.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span [τ, h] at t_1, then at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so both increase, moves right.\n\nFor the right-moving car on freeway 3: (head h, tail τ) = (-18, -29, right, 6)\n\nSo for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-29, -18] at t_1, which is from x= -29 to x= -18, so head at h= -18 (right end), tail at τ= -29 (left end), moving right, so at T, [ -29 +6ΔT, -18 +6ΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving on freeway 1: (h, τ) = (48,83, left,36), span [h, τ] = [48,83], but 48 to 83, with h=48 left end, τ=83 right end? But it says head at h, so for left-moving, head is at the left end? But when moving left, the head should be the front, which is the right end if x increases right.\n\nI think there's confusion in the definition of \"head\".\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should not worry about head and tail, but just the span positions.\n\nFor collision, I only care if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nSo for each car, at time t, the span is defined.\n\nLet t be absolute turn number.\n\nt_1 = 8.\n\nFor a car at t_1, with parameters, the span at time t is:\n\nIf left-moving: span(t) = [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)]\n\nIf right-moving: span(t) = [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]  for the right-moving case, since span(t) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] with Δt = t - t_1.\n\nAnd for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ], so h is left end, τ is right end.\n\nIn freeway 1 left-moving: (h,τ) = (48,83), so left end 48, right end 83.\n\nMoving left, so left end decreases, right end decreases.\n\nIn freeway 3 right-moving: for first car, (h,τ) = (-18,-29), but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-29, -18], so left end τ=-29, right end h=-18.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow for freeway 3, there are three cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor (60,49,right,6): h=60, τ=49, span [τ,h] = [49,60], so left end 49, right end 60.\n\nSimilarly, (24,13,right,6): h=24, τ=13, span [13,24].\n\nAnd (-18,-29,right,6): span [-29,-18].\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 same cars.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 have only one car each: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is covered on each freeway.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t, if I am on freeway y, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, I need to check all on that row.\n\nAlso, note that the player position is at x=0 always, I think, since it says position (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, only y changes.\n\nSo collision if at turn t, y_t = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at time t.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0 (t=8), y=3, on freeway 3.\n\nI need to move to y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal H, number of turns, so from τ=0 to τ=H-1, actions, and at τ=H-1, position should be 9.\n\nAt τ=0, position y=3, I take action a_{t_1} = a_8 for τ=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, position based on a_8, and so on, until at some τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from τ=0 to H-1.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 in min turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I should compute for each freeway, for each turn, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nBut turns are absolute, so let's set t = turn number.\n\nt_1 = 8.\n\nI need from t=8 onwards.\n\nFor each freeway k=1 to 8, and for each car on it, I can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for a given turn t, freeway k has collision at x=0 if for any car on k, 0 in span at t.\n\nIf no car covers 0 at t, then safe to be on k at t.\n\nNow, let's list all cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, left-moving: h=48, τ=83, s=36, left.\n\nSpan at time t: [48 - 36(t-8), 83 - 36(t-8)]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36(t-8) <= 0 <= 83 - 36(t-8)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so same span, same times unsafe.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 have identical cars? Freeway 2 also (48,83,left,36), so yes, same.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-18,-29,right,6) , right-moving, span at t: [ -29 + 6(t-8), -18 + 6(t-8) ]\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6) , h=60, τ=49, right-moving, span [49 + 6(t-8), 60 + 6(t-8)]\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,6) , h=24, τ=13, span [13 + 6(t-8), 24 + 6(t-8)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, three cars identical.\n\nFreeway 5: one car (-18,-29,right,6) same as first car on 3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8: each has one car (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, find for which t, x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 (and similarly 2):\n\nCar span: left end L(t) = 48 - 36(t-8)\n\nRight end R(t) = 83 - 36(t-8)\n\n0 in [L(t), R(t)] if L(t) <= 0 <= R(t)\n\nSince L(t) <= R(t) always.\n\nL(t) = 48 - 36(t-8)\n\nR(t) = 83 - 36(t-8)\n\nSet L(t) <= 0: 48 - 36(t-8) <= 0 => 48 <= 36(t-8) => t-8 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so t-8 >= 2 since t integer? t-8 >= ceil(48/36)\n\n48/36 = 4/3 = 1.333, so t-8 >= 2? L(t) <= 0 when 48 -36Δt <=0, Δt = t-8, so 36Δt >=48, Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3, since Δt integer, Δt >= 2.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= R(t): 0 <= 83 -36Δt, so 36Δt <=83, Δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so Δt <= 2.\n\nSo L(t) <=0 for Δt >= 2, 0 <= R(t) for Δt <= 2.\n\n0 in [L,R] when both L<=0 and 0<=R.\n\nL<=0 for Δt >=2, 0<=R for Δt <=2.\n\nSo for Δt=2: L(2) =48-36*2 +36*8? Δt=t-8, so at t, L(t)=48-36(t-8)\n\nSet Δt = t-8.\n\nL(Δt) =48 -36Δt\n\nR(Δt) =83 -36Δt\n\nL(Δt) <=0 when 48-36Δt <=0, 36Δt >=48, Δt >= 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so for Δt >=2 since integer.\n\n0 <= R(Δt) when 0<=83-36Δt, 36Δt <=83, Δt <=83/36≈2.305, so Δt <=2.\n\nThus for Δt=2: L(2)=48-72= -24? Δt=2, L=48-36*2=48-72=-24 <=0\n\nR=83-72=11 >=0, so 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor Δt=1: L(1)=48-36=12 >0, so L=12>0, so 0 not <= L? [L,R] = [12,47] for Δt=1? L(1)=48-36=12, R=83-36=47, so [12,47], 0 not in, since 0<12.\n\nFor Δt=0: L=48, R=83, [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nFor Δt=2: L=48-72=-24, R=83-72=11, [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nFor Δt=3: L=48-108=-60, R=83-108=-25, [-60,-25], 0 not in, since -25<0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 covered only at Δt=2, i.e., t= t_1 +2 =10.\n\nt=8 +2=10.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-18,-29,right,6), span at t: [ -29 +6(Δt), -18 +6(Δt) ] with Δt=t-8\n\n0 in span if -29 +6Δt <=0 and 0 <= -18 +6Δt? The span is [left, right] = [ -29+6Δt, -18+6Δt ]\n\n0 in [left, right] if left <=0 and 0<=right.\n\nleft <=0: -29 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=29 => Δt <= 29/6 ≈4.833, so Δt <=4\n\n0<=right: 0 <= -18 +6Δt => 6Δt >=18 => Δt >=3\n\nSo for Δt=3,4\n\nΔt=3: left= -29+18= -11 <=0, right= -18+18=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included, so yes.\n\nΔt=4: left= -29+24= -5, right= -18+24=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=2: left= -29+12= -17, right= -18+12= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=5: left= -29+30=1, right= -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo covered at t=8+3=11 and t=8+4=12.\n\nΔt=3 and 4, t=11 and 12.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (60,49,right,6), but (head h, tail τ) = (60,49,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ, h] = [49,60] at t_1.\n\nAt t: [49 +6(Δt), 60 +6(Δt)]\n\n0 in [49+6Δt, 60+6Δt]\n\nSince 49+6Δt >=49>0 for Δt>=0, so left end always >0, so 0 never in, because min left is 49 at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (24,13,right,6), span [13 +6Δt, 24+6Δt], always >=13>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo on freeway 3, only the first car covers 0, at t=11 and t=12.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same as 3, covered at t=11,12.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (-18,-29,right,6), same as first car on freeway 3, so span [ -29+6Δt, -18+6Δt], covers 0 at Δt=3 and 4, t=11,12.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8: each has same car (-18,-29,right,6), so each covers 0 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have this car, so for each, at t=11 and 12, unsafe.\n\nNow, for other times, are they safe?\n\nFor example, freeway 1 and 2 only unsafe at t=10.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nBut for freeway 3, we have three cars, but only one covers 0 at t=11,12, others don't.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for times not mentioned, should be safe, but let's confirm.\n\nFor instance, freeway 1: only unsafe at t=10.\n\nFor t=8,9,11,12,... should be safe.\n\nt=8: Δt=0, span [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nt=9: Δt=1, [48-36,83-36]= [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nt=10: [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nt=11: [48-36*3,83-36*3]= [48-108,83-108]= [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFreeway 3: at t=10, Δt=2, first car: [-29+12, -18+12]= [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSecond and third car not cover.\n\nt=11: Δt=3, first car: [-29+18, -18+18]= [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nt=12: [-29+24, -18+24]= [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=13: [-29+30, -18+30]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, summary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at t=10\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at t=10\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at t=11,12\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at t=11,12\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at t=11,12\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at t=11,12\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at t=11,12\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=11,12\n\nAnd for all other times, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe, no cars.\n\nI start at t=8, y=3.\n\nAt t=8, I am on freeway 3. Is it safe?\n\nAt t=8, freeway 3: from above, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and I can move up or down or stay.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so at least 6 moves up, but I can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, I should only move up, no down or stay, but I have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nIf I move up every turn, I can reach in 6 turns: from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps.\n\nBut I need to check if I can be on each y at safe times.\n\nStart at t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nAfter action, I move to next position at next turn.\n\nLet's think in terms of when I am on each row.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\ny_t is position during turn t.\n\nI need to ensure that at each turn t when I am on freeway k (1-8), it is not unsafe at t.\n\nNow, I start at t=8, y=3.\n\nIf I take action U at t=8, then at t=9, y=4.\n\nIf U at t=9, y=5 at t=10, and so on.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nt=10 is unsafe for y=1 and y=2, but y=1 and 2 are low, I am at y=3, going up, so probably not on y=1 or 2.\n\nt=11 and 12 unsafe for y=3 to 8.\n\nNow, I need to be careful.\n\nI want to minimize H, so I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nStart: t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=4 at t=9? At turn t, I take action, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn t=8: position y=3, take action a_8.\n\nThen y_{9} = y_8 + Δy based on a_8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t is set, and I take action a_t.\n\nFor collision at time t, it depends on y_t and the cars at t.\n\nNow, for the path: start t=8, y_8=3.\n\nI need y_{t} for t>=8.\n\nGoal y_{t} =9 for some t, minimal t.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from t_1, so if I reach at turn T, then H = T - t_1 +1? Let's see.\n\nt_1 =8, at τ=0, t=8.\n\nAfter H turns, I have taken actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, so at turn t= t_1 + (H-1), position y.\n\nAnd I need y =9 at that turn.\n\nFor example, if H=1, I take one action, but at τ=0, I take a_{t_1}, and after that, at turn t_1, position is given, but I take action to change for next turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position, then I take action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the position at turn t is y_t, and I need to not collide at t if y_t in 1-8.\n\nThen after action, at t+1, new position.\n\nI need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nAt that turn, since y=9, no collision.\n\nMinimal t such that y_t=9, with y_8=3.\n\nThen H = (t - 8) +1, since from t=8 to t, it takes (t-8) steps? Let's see.\n\nFrom t=8 to t=9, one step, y_9 set.\n\nGenerally, from start at t=8, after k steps (actions), I am at turn t=8+k.\n\nPosition y_{8+k}.\n\nSet τ = k, then after τ actions, at turn t=8+τ, position y_{8+τ}.\n\nI need y_{8+τ} =9 for some τ, minimal τ.\n\nThen H = τ +1? τ is the index, from τ=0 to τ, but at τ=0, t=8, position given.\n\nAfter τ actions, I have positions from t=8 to t=8+τ.\n\nThe number of turns from t_1 included is τ+1.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, from τ=0 to H-1, so if I reach at turn t=8 + (H-1), with y=9.\n\nFor example, if I start at t=8, and at t=8, y=3, if I do nothing, but I have to take actions to move.\n\nIf at t=8, I could stay, but y=3 not 9.\n\nI need to move to y=9.\n\nMinimal τ such that y_{8+τ} =9.\n\nSince I need to increase by 6, minimal τ is 6, if I move up each time.\n\nBut may not be possible due to collisions.\n\nτ is the number of actions, so with τ actions, I can be at y_{8+τ}.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=3, with only up moves, τ=6, at t=14, y=9.\n\nBut I can reach earlier if I move faster, but I can only move +1 per up, so min τ=6, t=14.\n\nτ=6, t=8+6=14.\n\nBut with actions, at t=8, after 0 actions, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=9, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions, at t=14, y=9 if all U.\n\nBut I may reach earlier if I start higher, but I start at 3, so no, min 6 up moves.\n\nUnless I move down and up, but that would take more turns, so for min time, should not move down or stay, only up if possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSo let's try the direct path: always up.\n\nStart t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U: so at t=9, y=4.\n\nt=9, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt t=9, is freeway 4 unsafe?\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at t=11,12, not at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=1, freeway 4: cars same as freeway 3, at Δt=1, first car: [-29+6(1), -18+6(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not cover, so safe.\n\nSo at t=9, y=4 safe.\n\nAction U: at t=10, y=5.\n\nt=10, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at t=11,12, not at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, freeway 5: car (-18,-29,right,6), span [ -29+6(2), -18+6(2) ] = [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U: at t=11, y=6.\n\nt=11, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nBut freeway 6 unsafe at t=11! Because t=11, Δt=3, car span [ -29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], 0 in, so collision.\n\nCannot be on y=6 at t=11.\n\nIf I go up at t=10 to y=6 at t=11, but unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, direct path has problem at t=11.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeways 3-8 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nt=11 and 12 are unsafe for y=3 to 8.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nI start at y=3, need to reach y=9.\n\nI could go down to y=0 to wait, or go up but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSince unsafe at t=11,12 for mid rows, I could be on y=0 or y=9 at those times.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal.\n\nMinimal time: if I can reach y=9 before t=11, but from t=8, to go from 3 to 9, min 6 steps, t=14, which is after t=12.\n\nt=14>12, so I have to pass through the unsafe period.\n\nI could be on y=0 during unsafe times.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0 at some point.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince the unsafe times are t=11 and 12, I need to not be on freeways 1-8 at those times.\n\nBut freeways 1-8, so y=0 or y=9 are safe.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, at t=11 and 12, I should be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, so if I can reach y=9 before t=11, but impossible, min t=14.\n\nt=14 is after.\n\nSo I must be on y=0 at t=11 and/or t=12 to avoid.\n\nThen after that, go up to 9.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, I can stay there.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should reach y=9 asap, so I might go down to 0 before t=11, wait during t=11,12, then go up.\n\nBut going down takes extra moves.\n\nLet's list the turns: t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,...\n\nI am at y=3 at t=8.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some t.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=0 at t=11 and t=12.\n\ny=0 at t=11.\n\nNow, from t=8, y=3 to y=0 at t=11.\n\nt=11 is 3 turns later.\n\nAt t=8, y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=8, y9.\n\nAt t=9, y9, etc.\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=11.\n\ny_11 =0.\n\nFrom y_8=3 to y_11=0, I need to decrease by 3, so in 3 steps, I can do it with down moves.\n\nFor example, actions: at t=8, D: to y=2 at t=9? Action at t=8: if D, y9 = y8 -1 = 3-1=2.\n\nThen at t=9, y=2, take action, etc.\n\nTo reach y_11=0.\n\ny_11 is set after actions from t=8 to t=10.\n\nActions: at t=8, t=9, t=10 determine y_9, y_10, y_11.\n\ny_8 given.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy8\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy9\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy10\n\nSet y_11=0.\n\ny_8=3.\n\nSo y_11 = y_8 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 = 3 + sum_{i=8,9,10} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,+1.\n\ny_11=0, so 3 + sum =0, so sum Δy = -3.\n\nSo in three actions, all D, then y_11=3-3=0.\n\nSimilarly, I can have some S, but that would take more actions, not minimal for reaching 0, but for waiting, I can stay.\n\nBut to reach 0 at t=11, min is all D.\n\nSimilarly, then at t=12, I can stay at y=0 or move.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, during t=11 and 12, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen after, I can go up to 9.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, to be at y=0 at t=11.\n\nStart t=8, y=3.\n\nAction at t=8: D, so y9=2.\n\nt=9, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt t=9, is freeway 2 unsafe? Freeway 2 unsafe only at t=10.\n\nt=9: from earlier, freeway 2 same as 1, at t=9, Δt=1, span [12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction at t=9: D, so y10=1.\n\nt=10, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nAt t=10, freeway 1 unsafe! Because t=10 is unsafe for y=1.\n\nCollision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=10, if I am on y=1, unsafe.\n\nBut in this path, to go to y=0 at t=11, I need to be at y=1 or y=0 at t=10.\n\ny_10=1 if I go down.\n\nBut t=10, y=1 unsafe.\n\nIf I go directly to y=0 earlier.\n\ny_11=0, but at t=10, I need y_10.\n\nFrom above, with all D, y_10= y_8 + Δy8 + Δy9? y_10 = y_9 + Δy9.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy8\n\nIf Δy8 = -1, y9=2\n\nThen Δy9 = -1, y10=1\n\nThen Δy10 = -1, y11=0\n\nAt t=10, y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=9, I stay, but y_10 would be higher if I don't go down.\n\nSet y_11=0.\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy10\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy9\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy8\n\ny_8=3\n\ny_11=0\n\nSo 0 = y_11 = y_10 + Δy10\n\ny_10 + Δy10 =0\n\nSimilarly, y_10 = y_9 + Δy9\n\ny_9 = 3 + Δy8\n\nΔy10 must be such that y_10 + Δy10 =0, so since y_10 >=0, if y_10=0, Δy10=0 or +1? But y_11=0, so if y_10=0, Δy10=0 (S) or -1 but y=0, cannot go down, y must in [0,9], so at y=0, if action D, y next =0, I think, since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y in [0,9], so if at 0 and D, stay at 0. Similarly at 9 and U, stay at 9.\n\nFrom the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} clamped to [0,9]? The note says y_{t+1} in [0,9], but not specified how, but in the equation, it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I think it's clamped, so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0, similarly at 9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nAlso for S, same.\n\nSo y_11=0, so possible if y_10=0 and action S, or y_10=1 and action D, but if y_10=1 and D, y_11=0.\n\nOr y_10=0 and S, y_11=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in any case, to have y_11=0, y_10 must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_10=0, then action S or D, but D keeps at 0, S keeps at 0.\n\nIf y_10=1, then action D to y_11=0.\n\nNow, at t=10, if y_10=1, it is unsafe, as freeway 1 unsafe at t=10.\n\nIf y_10=0, safe, since y=0 no cars.\n\nSo to avoid collision at t=10, I need y_10=0 if I want y_11=0.\n\nBecause if y_10=1, unsafe, and also to reach y_11=0, it requires action D from y_10=1.\n\nBut at t=10, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe way to have y_11=0 is to have y_10=0, and then action S or D to stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly, for y_12, if I want to be at 0.\n\nBut first, let's go back.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at t=11 and t=12 to avoid the unsafe rows.\n\nSo set y_11=0 and y_12=0.\n\ny_12=0 can be from y_11=0 with action S.\n\nNow, y_11=0 requires y_10=0, as above.\n\nBecause if y_10=1, unsafe at t=10, and y_11=0 requires y_10=1 with D, but unsafe.\n\nSo y_10 must be 0 for safety and to reach y_11=0.\n\nThen from y_10=0, action S at t=10, y_11=0.\n\nThen at t=11, action S, y_12=0.\n\nThen after, go up to 9.\n\nBut now, from t=8, y=3 to y_10=0.\n\ny_10=0.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy9\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy8 = 3 + Δy8\n\ny_10 = 3 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nSet y_10=0.\n\nSo 3 + Δy8 + Δy9 =0\n\nEach Δy -1,0,1, so sum Δy8 and Δy9 must be -3.\n\nPossible only if both D, Δy8=-1, Δy9=-1, then y_10=3-1-1=1, not 0.\n\ny_10= y_9 + Δy9, y_9=3 + Δy8.\n\nIf Δy8=-1, y9=2\n\nThen to have y10=0, need Δy9 such that 2 + Δy9 =0, so Δy9=-2, impossible, only -1,0,1.\n\nSo y10 cannot be 0 from y9=2; min y10=1 with D.\n\nIf at t=8, S, y9=3, then y10=3 + Δy9, min 2 with D.\n\nCannot reach y10=0 in two steps from y8=3.\n\nWith two actions, from y=3, I can reach y=1,2,3,4,5 but not 0 or 6? y9=3 + Δy8, so y9=2,3,4\n\nThen y10= y9 + Δy9, so if y9=2, y10=1,2,3\n\nIf y9=3, y10=2,3,4\n\nIf y9=4, y10=3,4,5\n\nSo y10 can be 1,2,3,4,5, not 0.\n\nSimilarly, y11 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nFrom above, to have y11=0, need y10=1 with D, or y10=0 with S or D.\n\nBut y10 cannot be 0, so only possibility is y10=1 with action D at t=10, to y11=0.\n\nBut at t=10, y10=1 is unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=0 at t=11 without being at y=1 at t=10, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=0 at t=11 safely.\n\nSimilarly, for t=12, to be at y=0, I need to be there at t=11 or t=12 with appropriate actions.\n\nBut t=11 and 12 are the unsafe times for mid rows, but y=0 is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=0 at t=11, I have to go through low rows at t=10, which is unsafe for y=1 and 2.\n\nSpecifically, to be at y=0 at t=11, I must have been at y=1 at t=10 with action D, or at y=0 at t=10 with action S or D.\n\nBut y=0 at t=10 is possible only if I was at y=0 or y=1 at t=9, etc., but from start, I am at y=3, so at t=10, I can be at y=1,2,3,4,5 as above, not 0, so only y10=1 with D to y11=0, but y10=1 unsafe.\n\nThus, it's impossible to be at y=0 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=0 at t=12, I can have y12=0 from y11=0 or y11=1 with D.\n\nBut to have y11=0, same problem as above.\n\nOr directly to y12=0.\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\ny9 = 3 + Δy8\n\nSo y12 = 3 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\nSet to 0, so sum of four Δy must be -3.\n\nPossible, e.g., three D and one S, or other combinations.\n\nFor example, Δy8=-1, Δy9=-1, Δy10=-1, Δy11=0, then y12=3-1-1-1+0=0, but y11= y10 + Δy10, let's compute positions.\n\nStart t=8, y=3.\n\nAction at t=8: D, y9=2\n\nt=9, y=2, action D, y10=1\n\nt=10, y=1, unsafe! Collision at t=10.\n\nThen action at t=10: D, y11=0\n\nBut at t=10, already collision, so invalid.\n\nAction at t=8: S, y9=3\n\nAction at t=9: D, y10=2\n\nAction at t=10: D, y11=1\n\nAction at t=11: D, y12=0\n\nBut at t=10, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at t=10? Freeway 2 unsafe at t=10, yes.\n\nt=10, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y10=1, same.\n\nAt t=10, freeway 1 and 2 are unsafe, so y=1 or 2 at t=10 is unsafe.\n\ny=3 at t=10: freeway 3, at t=10, is it safe? Freeway 3 unsafe at t=11,12, not at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, Δt=2, freeway 3: first car [-29+12, -18+12]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, other cars not cover, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=10: freeway 4, similar, safe.\n\ny=5 to 8 at t=10: all safe, since only unsafe at t=11,12.\n\ny=0 and 9 safe.\n\nSo at t=10, unsafe only for y=1 and y=2.\n\ny=3 to 8 safe at t=10.\n\nThen at t=11 and 12, unsafe for y=3 to 8.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe at t=11,12, since only unsafe at t=10.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 only unsafe at t=10, so at t=11,12, safe.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nSo to summarize safe rows:\n\nAt t=8: all rows safe except possibly, but at t=8, no unsafe, all safe.\n\nt=9: similarly, all safe, since t=10 unsafe only for 1,2 but t=9 ok.\n\nt=10: unsafe for y=1,2; safe for y=3,4,5,6,7,8,0,9\n\nt=11: unsafe for y=3,4,5,6,7,8; safe for y=0,1,2,9\n\nt=12: same as t=11, unsafe for y=3-8, safe for y=0,1,2,9\n\nt=13 and after: all safe, since no more unsafe times mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 at t=8 to y=9 at some t.\n\nTo minimize t, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on y=3-8 at t=11 and 12.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=1,2 at t=10.\n\nSince I start at y=3, which is safe at t=8 and t=9,10, but not at t=11,12.\n\nOne way is to be on a safe row during unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=11 and 12, be on y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\ny=9 is goal, so if possible, reach y=9 before t=11, but impossible.\n\nOr be on y=0,1,2 at t=11,12.\n\nBut y=1,2 are safe at t=11,12.\n\ny=0 also.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, I might not want to go down, but I have to avoid the mid rows.\n\nSince at t=10, y=1,2 are unsafe, but at t=11,12, y=1,2 are safe.\n\nSo I can be on y=1 or 2 at t=11,12.\n\nOr y=0.\n\nBut y=0 might be farther.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=3, 6 up moves to y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=11 and 12, I need to not be on y=3-8.\n\nSo for example, at t=11 and 12, I should be on y=0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable yet.\n\nSo be on y=0,1,2.\n\nBut at t=10, I cannot be on y=1 or 2 because unsafe.\n\nSo at t=10, I must be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8,0,9.\n\nBut y=0,9 not likely, so y=3-8.\n\nThen at t=11, I need to be on y=0,1,2.\n\nFrom y at t=10, to y at t=11 with action.\n\nIf at t=10, y=3, I can go down to y=2 at t=11, or stay y=3, or up to y=4, etc.\n\nBut to be on y=0,1,2 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for t=12.\n\nAlso, after that, go to y=9.\n\nSince I have to be on low rows at t=11,12, I might as well go down at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I am on y=3 (safe), then action D, so at t=11, y=2.\n\nt=11, y=2, which is safe because at t=11, y=1,2 are safe.\n\nThen at t=11, I can stay or move.\n\nBut at t=12, I need to be on safe row, y=0,1,2.\n\nIf I stay at y=2, safe.\n\nThen after t=12, I can go up to 9.\n\nLet's compute the turns.\n\nStart t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nTo avoid the issue, I can stay or move slowly.\n\nBut for minimal time, let's see how early I can be at y=9.\n\nEarliest at t=14 with all U.\n\nBut at t=11, if I am on y=4 or something, unsafe.\n\nIn all U path:\n\nt=8, y=3 safe\n\na U, t=9 y=4 safe (freeway 4 safe at t=9)\n\na U, t=10 y=5 safe (freeway 5 safe at t=10)\n\na U, t=11 y=6 unsafe! Because t=11, y=6 freeway 6 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo need to avoid.\n\nAt t=10, y=5, instead of U, I could do D or S.\n\nBut if S, at t=11 y=5, unsafe.\n\nIf D, at t=11 y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo at t=10, if I am on y=5, any action to t=11 will put me on y=4,5,6, all unsafe at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=10 on y=4, to y=3,4,5 at t=11, all unsafe.\n\ny=3,4,5 at t=11 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=10 on y=6, to y=5,6,7 at t=11 unsafe.\n\nOnly if at t=10 on y=2 or y=1, but at t=10, y=1 or 2 unsafe, cannot.\n\nOr y=0 or y=7,8.\n\ny=0: but at t=10, if y=0, safe, then at t=11, I can go to y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf to y=1, safe at t=11.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at t=10.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, to y=0 at t=10.\n\ny_10=0.\n\nBut as before, with two actions, from y=3, y10 can be 1,2,3,4,5, not 0.\n\nCannot reach y=0 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8 at t=10.\n\nFor example, y=7 at t=10.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, with two actions, can I reach y=7? y9=3 + Δy8, so y9=2,3,4\n\ny10= y9 + Δy9, so if y9=4, y10=3,4,5\n\nMax y10=5, min 1, so y=7 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=0,1,2,7,8,9 at t=10 from start in two steps; only y=1 to 5 possible.\n\nAt t=10, I must be on y=3,4,5, and all of them lead to unsafe positions at t=11 with any action.\n\nUnless I can be on y=2 at t=10, but y=2 at t=10 unsafe, and also from start, with two down, y10=1, not 2.\n\nLet's list possible positions.\n\nAt t=8: y=3\n\nAfter a8, y9 = 3 + Δy8, so y9=2,3,4\n\nAt t=9, depending on y9.\n\nIf y9=2, then at t=9, y=2, freeway 2, safe at t=9 (since unsafe only at t=10).\n\nThen action a9, y10 = 2 + Δy9, so y10=1,2,3\n\nBut at t=10, if y10=1 or 2, unsafe; if y10=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, y=3, action a10, y11=2,3,4 all unsafe at t=11.\n\nIf at t=9, y9=3, then at t=9, y=3, safe.\n\nAction a9, y10=2,3,4\n\nIf y10=2, unsafe at t=10; if y10=3 or 4, safe at t=10.\n\nThen y10=3 or 4, action to y11=2,3,4 or 3,4,5, all unsafe at t=11.\n\nIf at t=9, y9=4, similar, y10=3,4,5, if y10=3 or4 or5, safe at t=10, then to y11=2,3,4 or 3,4,5 or 4,5,6, all unsafe.\n\nSo in all cases, at t=11, I will be on an unsafe row if I follow the path.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be on y=0,1,2 at t=11.\n\nBut to be on y=0,1,2 at t=11, I need to be at low position at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=10, if I am on y=1 or 2, but unsafe at t=10.\n\nOr on y=0, but cannot.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=1 or 2 at t=10 with the understanding that it is unsafe, but I have to be there to go to lower, but collision occurs at the turn when I am on it, so I cannot be on y=1 or 2 at t=10.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=0,1,2 at t=11 without being on unsafe row at t=10 or earlier.\n\nSpecifically, to have y11=2, for example.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nIf y11=2, then y10 + Δy10 =2, so y10 could be 1,2,3.\n\nIf y10=1, unsafe at t=10.\n\nIf y10=2, unsafe at t=10.\n\nIf y10=3, safe at t=10, then with Δy10= -1, y11=2.\n\nThen at t=11, y=2, which is safe, since y=2 safe at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for y11=1 or 0.\n\nFor y11=1: y10 could be 0,1,2.\n\ny10=0 not possible, y10=1 or 2 unsafe, or y10=2 with Δy10= -1, but y10=2 unsafe.\n\nOr y10=1 with Δy10=0, y11=1, but y10=1 unsafe.\n\nSo only possible if y10=3 with Δy10= -2, impossible, or y10=2 with Δy10= -1, but y10=2 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y11=0, only from y10=1 with D, but y10=1 unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe way to be on low row at t=11 is to be on y=3 at t=10 and go down to y=2 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, y=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=1 or 0 from there.\n\nBut at t=11, I am safe on y=2.\n\nThen for t=12, I can stay or move.\n\nBut let's outline a path.\n\nStart t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to be at y=3 at t=10 to go down.\n\nFrom t=8 to t=10.\n\nAt t=8, y=3.\n\nAction: I can move or stay.\n\nIf I stay at t=8, action S, then y9=3.\n\nAt t=9, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action at t=9: if I stay again, y10=3.\n\nAt t=10, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action at t=10: D, so y11=2.\n\nAt t=11, y=2, safe (since y=2 safe at t=11).\n\nThen at t=11, I can action U or S or D.\n\nBut I need to go to 9 eventually.\n\nAt t=12, I need to be safe; at t=12, y=2 is still safe.\n\nThen after, go up.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nTo reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=11, to y=9, need to increase by 7, so at least 7 up moves, from t=11 to t=18, for example.\n\nBut I can start going up earlier.\n\nIn the above, at t=8, I stayed, so I wasted moves.\n\nAt t=8, I could move up.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=8, y=3, action U, so y9=4.\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\nNow at t=9, I need to set for t=10.\n\nIf I stay at t=9, action S, y10=4.\n\nAt t=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen action D, y11=3, but y=3 at t=11 unsafe! Because freeway 3 unsafe at t=11.\n\nIf action U at t=10, y11=5, unsafe.\n\nOr S, y11=4, unsafe.\n\nSo at t=10 on y=4, any action to t=11 puts me on y=3,4,5, all unsafe at t=11.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=9, y=4, instead of staying, I could go down.\n\nAction D at t=9, so y10=3.\n\nThen at t=10, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action D at t=10, y11=2.\n\nAt t=11, y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at y=2 at t=11.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9.\n\nBut at t=11, y=2, I can start going up.\n\nActions from t=11.\n\nBut let's list all turns.\n\nSet actions.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=8): action U, so y9=4\n\nAt τ=1 (t=9): action D, so y10=3\n\nAt τ=2 (t=10): action D, so y11=2\n\nAt t=11, y=2, safe.\n\nNow at t=11, I am at y=2, take action, say U, so y12=3\n\nBut at t=12, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe at t=12! Collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=12, y=3-8 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=12, I cannot be on y=3.\n\nIf at t=11, I stay, action S, y12=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=12, y=2, safe.\n\nThen action U, y13=3, and so on.\n\nBut y=2 at t=12 is safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut let's see when I reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=12, to y=9, need 7 up moves, so at t=19, y=9.\n\nBut earlier I could have gone up faster.\n\nMinimal time.\n\nSince at t=11 and 12, I can be on y=2, safe.\n\nThen after t=12, all safe, so I can go up directly.\n\nBut to reach y=2 at t=11, and stay there or move.\n\nIn the above path, I have:\n\nt=8: y=3\n\na U: t=9 y=4\n\na D: t=10 y=3\n\na D: t=11 y=2\n\nThen at t=11, y=2, I can take action S, so y12=2\n\nThen at t=12, y=2, safe.\n\nThen start going up: a U at t=12, y13=3\n\na U at t=13, y14=4\n\na U at t=14, y15=5\n\na U at t=15, y16=6\n\na U at t=16, y17=7\n\na U at t=17, y18=8\n\na U at t=18, y19=9\n\nSo at t=19, y=9, so τ=11, since from t=8 to t=19, 11 actions? t=19 is t_1 + 11, since t_1=8, t=19=8+11.\n\nH-1 =11, H=12 turns.\n\nBut this is slow.\n\nI can go up faster before.\n\nFor example, at t=8, I can go up to higher position, but at t=10, I need to be at y=3 to go down to y=2 at t=11.\n\ny=3 at t=10.\n\nAt t=8, y=3, if I go up, t=9 y=4, then I need to go down to y=3 at t=10.\n\nAs above.\n\nIf at t=8, I stay, t=9 y=3, then t=10 y=3, then t=11 y=2.\n\nSame as before but I stayed instead of going up and down.\n\nIn that case, at t=9 y=3, t=10 y=3, then t=11 y=2.\n\nThen from y=2 at t=11, I can go up at t=11 to y=3, but t=11 y=3 unsafe? At t=11, if I go up from y=2, y12=3, but at t=12, y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=11, I go up to y=3, but at t=11, position is y=2, action U, so y12=3 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I should not go up at t=11; I should stay at y=2 or go down to y=1 or 0.\n\nBut to reach 9, I need to go up eventually.\n\nSo at t=11, stay at y=2 with S, then at t=12, y=2, safe, then go up.\n\nAs above.\n\nAt t=11, I can go up to y=3 only at t=12, unsafe, so better to stay at low during t=11 and 12.\n\nThen after t=12, go up.\n\nBut can I reach a higher position before t=10?\n\nFor example, at t=8, U, y9=4\n\nt=9, U, y10=5\n\nBut at t=10, y=5, safe, but then at t=11, whatever I do, I am on y=4,5,6, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can jump to y=0 or 9, but no.\n\nSo I have to go down at some point to be on low row at t=11.\n\nThe highest I can be at t=10 is y=5, but from there, I can only go to y=4,5,6 at t=11, unsafe.\n\nLower at t=10 is better for going down.\n\nBut at t=10, y=3 is safe, and I can go to y=2 at t=11.\n\ny=2 at t=11 is safe.\n\nThen at t=12, I can be on y=2 or y=1 or y=3, but y=3 unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, I should be on y=2 or lower.\n\nThen after t=12, go up.\n\nTo minimize time, I should be as high as possible before going down, but I have to go down to avoid.\n\nIn the path, at t=10, y=3, t=11 y=2, t=12 y=2.\n\nThen from t=12, y=2 to y=9, 7 up moves, so at t=19 y=9.\n\nBut from t=8 to t=19, 11 steps, H=12 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at higher position at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, I can be on y=1 or 0, but that would be lower, worse.\n\nOr on y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is the highest safe at t=12, since y=3-8 unsafe.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe at t=12.\n\nSo y=2 is best.\n\nNow, to reach y=2 at t=11, from start.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, I can go directly.\n\nFor example, at t=8, action D, y9=2\n\nBut at t=9, y=2, freeway 2, safe at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, I can stay or move.\n\nBut at t=10, if I am on y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=2 at t=10.\n\nAt t=9, y=2, action U, so y10=3\n\nThen at t=10, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action D, y11=2\n\nAt t=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, action S, y12=2\n\nThen from t=12, start going up.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=9, after y9=2, I could action D, to y10=1, but at t=10, y=1 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo not good.\n\nOnly way is to be at y=3 or higher at t=10, then down to y=2 at t=11.\n\nSo minimal path to be at y=2 at t=11 with 3 actions: e.g. U then D then D, or S S D, etc., but positions as above.\n\nThen from t=11 to t=12, stay at y=2.\n\nThen from t=12 to t=19, 7 up moves to y=9.\n\nBut t=19 is late.\n\nSince after t=12, all safe, and I am at y=2, I can go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut is there a way to be at a higher position after t=12?\n\nFor example, at t=11, y=2, instead of staying, I could go up to y=3, but at t=12, y=3 unsafe, so I cannot.\n\nGo down to y=1, but then lower, worse.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=2 during t=11 and 12.\n\nThen at t=12, I am at y=2, and I can go up.\n\nBut at t=12, action U, to y13=3 at t=13.\n\nThen U to y14=4, and so on to y19=9.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, to t=13 to t=19, 7 turns.\n\nt=13 to t=19 is 7 positions: t=13 y=3, t=14 y=4, ..., t=19 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=12 to t=18 for positions t=13 to t=19.\n\nAt t=12, position y=2, take action for y13.\n\nAfter 7 actions from t=12 to t=18, y19=9.\n\nBut t=19 = t_1 + 11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=8, go up to y=4 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, instead of going down, go up to y=5 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, y=5, but then at t=11, I have to go down to low, but from y=5, to go to y=2 at t=11, I need action D at t=10, y11=4, but y=4 at t=11 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down twice, but at t=10 y=5, action D, y11=4 unsafe.\n\nNo way to reach safe low row from high at t=10.\n\nSo the only safe low row to be at t=11 is y=2, from y=3 at t=10 with D.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 12, with the path:\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=8 (τ=0): U (to y=4 at t=9)\n\nAt t=9 (τ=1): D (to y=3 at t=10)\n\nAt t=10 (τ=2): D (to y=2 at t=11)\n\nAt t=11 (τ=3): S (stay at y=2 for t=12)\n\nAt t=12 (τ=4): U (to y=3 at t=13)\n\nAt t=13 (τ=5): U (y=4 at t=14)\n\nAt t=14 (τ=6): U (y=5 at t=15)\n\nAt t=15 (τ=7): U (y=6 at t=16)\n\nAt t=16 (τ=8): U (y=7 at t=17)\n\nAt t=17 (τ=9): U (y=8 at t=18)\n\nAt t=18 (τ=10): U (y=9 at t=19)\n\nAt t=19, y=9, so I reached at t=19, which is after H-1 actions, τ=10, so H=11 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=8), action, to position at t=9.\n\nAfter k actions, position at t=8+k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, position at t=8.\n\nAfter 1 action, position at t=9.\n\n...\n\nAfter 10 actions, position at t=18.\n\nIn the sequence, after a_t for t=8 to 18, position at t=19.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=8 to t=18 inclusive, that's 11 actions.\n\nPosition at t=19, y=9.\n\nBut t=19 = t_1 + 11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nτ from 0 to 10, 11 values, H=11 actions.\n\nBut let's list the position:\n\nt=8: y=3 (start)\n\na8: U, so t=9: y=4\n\na9: D, t=10: y=3\n\na10: D, t=11: y=2\n\na11: S, t=12: y=2\n\na12: U, t=13: y=3\n\na13: U, t=14: y=4\n\na14: U, t=15: y=5\n\na15: U, t=16: y=6\n\na16: U, t=17: y=7\n\na17: U, t=18: y=8\n\na18: U, t=19: y=9\n\nYes, at t=19, y=9.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=18, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 with fewer actions if I go down less.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=11 and 12, I can be on y=1 or 0, but that might not help.\n\nOr, at t=12, if I can be on y=9, but impossible.\n\nNotice that at t=12, y=9 is safe, but I can't reach it from low position.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=8 or something before t=11, but at t=11, I have to be low.\n\nBut from high, I can't go to low in one step to safe row.\n\nFor example, at t=10, if I am at y=8, then at t=11, I can go to y=7,8,9, but y=7,8 unsafe at t=11, y=9 safe.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at t=10, then action U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9, safe, and I reached goal!\n\nIs that possible?\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8 to y=8 at t=10.\n\nWith two actions.\n\ny10 = y8 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny8=3\n\ny10=8, so 3 + Δy8 + Δy9 =8, so Δy8 + Δy9 =5.\n\nEach at most 1, so impossible, max y10=5 with U U.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 6 also impossible, max y10=5.\n\nSo cannot reach high enough to jump to y=9 at t=11.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to go down to y=2 during the unsafe period and then go up.\n\nBut in the path above, H=11 actions to reach at t=19.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nIn the path:\n\nt=8: y=3, safe\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4, at t=9, safe as earlier\n\nt=10: y=3, freeway 3, at t=10, safe\n\nt=11: y=2, freeway 2, at t=11, safe since unsafe only at t=10\n\nt=12: y=2, freeway 2, at t=12, safe\n\nt=13: y=3, freeway 3, at t=13, safe (no car covers 0)\n\nt=14: y=4, safe\n\n...\n\nup to t=19: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nMinimal H: is there a way with less than 11 actions?\n\nSuppose I go up faster at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at t=8, U, y9=4\n\nt=9, U, y10=5\n\nThen at t=10, y=5, but I have to do something for t=11.\n\nIf I action D, y11=4, unsafe at t=11.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction S, y11=5, unsafe.\n\nAction U, y11=6, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=10, y=5, I could action D to y11=4, but unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=2 at t=11, but with different path.\n\nFor example, at t=8, S, y9=3\n\nt=9, S, y10=3\n\nt=10, D, y11=2\n\nThen same as before, but I wasted one move staying.\n\nThen from t=11 y=2, S to t=12 y=2, then U from t=12 to t=18, y=9 at t=19, but with more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=8, D to y9=2\n\nThen at t=9, y=2, I must not stay, because if I action at t=9, if S, y10=2 unsafe, if D, y10=1 unsafe, if U, y10=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=10, y=3, action D, y11=2\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 11 actions from t=8 to t=18.\n\nTo reach at t=19.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier if I don't go to y=4 first.\n\nFor example, at t=8, S, y9=3\n\nt=9, D, y10=2 but at t=10 y=2 unsafe! Cannot.\n\nAt t=8, D, y9=2\n\nt=9, U, y10=3 as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the turns to reach y=9.\n\nFrom start t=8 y=3, to t=19 y=9, 11 steps.\n\nBut number of actions is 11.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions for t=8 to t=18.\n\nBut t=18 is t_1 + 10, since t_1=8.\n\nτ from 0 to 10.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAnd after that, position at t_1 + H is y=9, but the last action is at t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=8, H=11, so actions from t=8 to t=8+10=18.\n\nPosition at t=19 y=9.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nAs above:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter Turn 18 action, at t=19, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at Turn 11: S, which is t=11, action S, so y12=2 (since y11=2, S, y12=2)\n\nThen Turn 12: U, y13=3, etc.\n\nIn the action list, it should be for each turn.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the stay at t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=11, y=2, instead of S, I can go to y=1 or something, but that would not help.\n\nOr, since at t=12, I need to be safe, and y=2 is safe, but I can go to y=3 at t=12 only if I do it after t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, if I go to y=3, unsafe.\n\nSo I have to wait until t=13 to go to y=3.\n\nSo the stay is necessary to avoid being on mid row at t=12.\n\nIn this case, with S at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, I am at y=2, I could go down to y=1 at t=12.\n\nThen at t=12, y=1, safe.\n\nThen go up from there, but y=1 to y=9 takes more moves, worse.\n\nSimilarly, not good.\n\nSo minimal is to stay at y=2 during t=11 and 12.\n\nThus, the sequence should be as above.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to list the actions.\n\nH=11, so 11 actions.\n\nNow, to write:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut Turn 18 is t_1 + 10, since t_1=8, 8+10=18.\n\nAnd after this, at t=19, y=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nThen y18=9.\n\ny18 = y8 + sum_{t=8 to 17} Δy_t\n\ny8=3, y18=9, so sum of 10 actions must be +6.\n\nEach action +1 max, so possible only if all U except some S or D, but to have net +6 in 10 actions, possible, e.g., 6 U and 4 S, or 7 U and 3 D, but with D, it would take more U, but net +6.\n\nBut to reach faster, but from above, I have to spend actions to go down and stay.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut from start, with 10 actions, to y18.\n\nBut during t=11 and 12, I need to be on safe row.\n\nFor instance, if I am on y=2 at t=11 and t=12, then from t=12 to t=18, 6 turns, from y=2 to y=8, not 9.\n\ny12=2, after actions to t=18, y18.\n\n6 actions, can reach y=8 max, or y=9 with net +7, but 6 actions max +6, so y=8 at t=18, not 9.\n\nIf y12=2, y18 <= 2+6=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=18.\n\nIf I am higher at t=12, but at t=12, I can only be on y=0,1,2 safely.\n\ny=2 max.\n\nThen y12=2, y18=8 at best.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=18, y12 must be at least 3, but at t=12, y=3 unsafe, and I cannot be there.\n\nSo impossible to reach before t=19.\n\nThus minimal at t=19 with H=11 actions.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n\nBut in the action list, for Turn 11: S, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence without the initial U and D.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 8: S  (y9=3)\n\nTurn 9: S  (y10=3)\n\nTurn 10: D (y11=2)\n\nTurn 11: S (y12=2)\n\nThen Turn 12: U (y13=3)\n\n...\n\nSame as before but started with S S instead of U D, but same number of actions to reach.\n\nIn this case, from Turn 12 U to Turn 18 U, to y19=9.\n\nBut with Turn 8 and 9 S, I have two S, whereas in previous I had U and D, but net same.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I went to y=4 and back, which might not be necessary, but it doesn't increase the time.\n\nIn both cases, 11 actions.\n\nBut in the first sequence, with U at t=8 and D at t=9, I have extra move, but it doesn't change the reaching time.\n\nIn terms of H, same.\n\nBut perhaps I can save one action.\n\nSuppose at t=10, I am at y=3, action D to y11=2.\n\nThen at t=11, instead of S, I go directly to U, but to y12=3, unsafe at t=12.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I must have the S at t=11 to stay at y=2 for t=12.\n\nThus, no shorter.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 11 actions.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, there are multiple cars, but in the unsafe times, only the first car covers 0, so it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the player must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). The unsafe times for each freeway are derived from the car positions and movements:\n\n- Freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe only at turn \\(t = 10\\).\n- Freeways 3 to 8 are unsafe at turns \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\).\n- All freeways are safe at all other times.\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe, as they have no cars.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(t = 8\\). To minimize \\(H\\), the goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible while avoiding unsafe positions. The direct path of moving up every turn would result in a collision at turn \\(t = 11\\) when \\(y = 6\\) (or similar) is unsafe. Therefore, a detour is necessary to avoid the unsafe times \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\) for mid-level freeways (\\(y = 3\\) to \\(8\\)).\n\nThe optimal path involves:\n- Moving to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(t = 9\\) to gain height safely.\n- Returning to \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(t = 10\\) to position for descending.\n- Moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn \\(t = 11\\), which is safe at \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\).\n- Staying at \\(y = 2\\) during turn \\(t = 12\\) to avoid unsafe mid-level freeways.\n- Moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) starting from turn \\(t = 12\\), as all positions are safe after \\(t = 12\\).\n\nThis path requires 11 actions (\\(H = 11\\)), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 19\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\), move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 9\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), move down (D) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 10\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 11\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\), stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) for \\(t = 12\\).\n- From turns \\(t = 12\\) to \\(t = 18\\), move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 13\\), \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 14\\), ..., and finally \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 19\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- \\(t = 8\\): \\(y = 3\\), safe.\n- \\(t = 9\\): \\(y = 4\\), safe (freeway 4 safe at \\(t = 9\\)).\n- \\(t = 10\\): \\(y = 3\\), safe (freeway 3 safe at \\(t = 10\\)).\n- \\(t = 11\\): \\(y = 2\\), safe (freeway 2 safe at \\(t = 11\\)).\n- \\(t = 12\\): \\(y = 2\\), safe (freeway 2 safe at \\(t = 12\\)).\n- \\(t = 13\\) to \\(t = 18\\): \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\), all safe (no unsafe times after \\(t = 12\\)).\n- \\(t = 19\\): \\(y = 9\\), safe and goal reached.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 11, with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: D \\\\\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn, so I don't check for collision on the new freeway until I'm actually there.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=4 and need to get to y=9, I need to move up. Moving down or staying might be necessary to avoid cars, but since I need to go up, I should minimize downward moves.\n\nThe minimal number of turns without any cars would be 5, since I need to move up 5 times: from 4 to 5,5 to6,6 to7,7 to8,8 to9. But with cars, I might need to wait or move down sometimes.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states. The cars are given for freeways 1 to 8, but I'm starting at y=4, so freeways 1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to y=8? I think freeway k is at y=k, since y=0 is not a freeway, I assume it's safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are probably safe, as they are not freeways. The problem says freeways y=1,…,8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so I can be there without collision.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow, collision only happens on freeways y=1 to 8 if at that turn, for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThe player position is (0, y_t), and at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at turn T, then collision.\n\nAlso, when I take an action, I move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=9, so t_1=9.\n\nPlayer at (0,4) at turn 9.\n\nI need actions from turn 9 onwards.\n\nNow, the car spans at turn t for t>t_1 depend on the initial state at t_1 and the speed and direction.\n\nThe update is given for T > t_1, with Span(T) based on Span(t_1).\n\nt_1 is 9, so for any turn T >=9, we can compute the car positions.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care about when 0 is in the span at integer turns.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find out at which turns the car spans include 0.\n\nBecause if I'm on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in some car's span on that row, I crash.\n\nOtherwise, I'm safe.\n\nAlso, since multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all for that freeway.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is in their span.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: cars (12,47,left,36)\n\nSince direction left, moving left, so head at 12, tail at 47? Head and tail: for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and h decreases over time.\n\nIn the table: for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36)\n\nBut for left-moving, [h, τ] with h=12, τ=47? That seems odd because usually head is at the front, so if left-moving, head should be smaller if moving left.\n\nPerhaps I need to interpret the span.\n\nIt says: left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nWith h=12, τ=47, s=36.\n\nBut h=12, τ=47, so at t_1=9, span is [12,47], which is from 12 to 47, so if moving left, the head is at 12, which is left, and tail at 47, right? But moving left, so head decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3, it has (-12,-23,right,6), etc.\n\nLet's take freeway 1: (12,47,left,36)\n\nAt turn t_1=9, span is [h,τ] = [12,47] for left-moving.\n\nSo positions from 12 to 47.\n\nMoving left with speed 36 per turn? Speed s=36, but what units? The grid is in terms of position, but position is on x-axis, I think, but we only care about x=0 for collision.\n\nThe span is a range on the x-axis, and we care if 0 is in that range at the turn.\n\nSpeed s is in positions per turn, I assume.\n\nSo for freeway 1, left-moving car: at T, span is [12 - 36*(T-9), 47 - 36*(T-9)]\n\nSet this to include 0.\n\nSo 0 ∈ [12 - 36*(T-9), 47 - 36*(T-9)]\n\nWhich means 12 - 36*(T-9) <= 0 <= 47 - 36*(T-9)\n\nSince the car is moving left, the lower bound decreases, upper bound decreases.\n\nSo inequality:\n\nLeft: 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT, where ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 9\n\nFrom 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 12 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nFrom 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for ΔT from 1/3 to 47/36, but since turns are integer, T=9,10,11,... so ΔT integer.\n\nΔT >= 1/3, so since ΔT integer, ΔT >= 1? 1/3 is about 0.333, so for ΔT=0, T=9, let's check.\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=0, span [12,47], 0 not in, since 12>0.\n\nAt T=10, ΔT=1, span [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]\n\n-24 <= 0 <=11, yes, 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nAt T=11, ΔT=2, span [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25], -60<=0<=-25? 0 is greater than -25? -25 <= 0 is false, since -25 <0, so 0 not <= -25? Let's see:\n\nLower bound L = 12 -36ΔT, upper bound U =47-36ΔT\n\n0 ∈ [L,U] if L <= 0 <= U.\n\nAt T=10, L=-24, U=11, -24<=0<=11, true.\n\nAt T=11, L=12-72=-60, U=47-72=-25, so -60 <=0 <= -25? 0 <= -25 is false, so no.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=0, T=9, L=12, U=47, 12<=0 false.\n\nSo only at T=10, 0 is in the span for freeway 1.\n\nT=10, which is turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (12,47,left,36), so same thing, only at T=10, 0 in span.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and moves right.\n\nIn the table: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nh and τ: here h=-12, τ=-23? But Span should be [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? That seems backward.\n\nLet's read the notation.\n\nIn the car state: it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nIn this case, for first car on freeway 3: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right.\n\nSo for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-23 +6(T-9), -12 +6(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-48,-59,right,6), so h=-48, τ=-59? Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48] for right-moving.\n\nThen Span(T) = [-59 +6(T-9), -48 +6(T-9)]\n\nThird car: (30,19,right,6), h=30, τ=19, d=right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [19,30]\n\nThen Span(T) = [19 +6(T-9), 30 +6(T-9)]\n\nNow, we need when 0 is in any of these spans at turn T.\n\nFirst, for car 1: Span(T) = [-23 +6ΔT, -12 +6ΔT] where ΔT = T-9\n\nSet 0 ∈ [-23+6ΔT, -12+6ΔT]\n\nSo -23+6ΔT <= 0 <= -12+6ΔT\n\nLeft: -23+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+6ΔT => 12 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >= 2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=3.833, so for integer ΔT, ΔT=2,3\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=11, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=3, T=12, span [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=4, T=13, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 1<=0 false? 0 <=1 and 0>=1? 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=1, T=10, span [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], -17<=0<=-6 false.\n\nΔT=0, T=9, [-23,-12], no.\n\nSo for car1, 0 in span at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow second car: (-48,-59,right,6), Span(T) = [-59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\n0 ∈ [-59+6ΔT, -48+6ΔT]\n\n-59+6ΔT <=0 <= -48+6ΔT\n\nLeft: -59+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/6≈9.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+6ΔT => 48 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=8\n\nSo ΔT >=8 and ΔT <=9.833, so T=17,18? T=9 + ΔT\n\nΔT=8, T=17, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], yes\n\nΔT=9, T=18, span [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], yes\n\nΔT=10, T=19, span [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], no\n\nSo for car2, 0 at T=17,18\n\nBut we might not care about far future, since H might be small.\n\nThird car: (30,19,right,6), but h=30, τ=19, d=right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [19,30]\n\nSpan(T) = [19 +6ΔT, 30 +6ΔT]\n\n0 ∈ [19+6ΔT, 30+6ΔT]\n\n19+6ΔT <=0 <=30+6ΔT? 19+6ΔT <=0 is impossible since ΔT>=0, 19>0.\n\nSo never, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only car1 and car2 can have 0, but car2 at T=17,18 which might be late, car1 at T=11,12.\n\nSpecifically, at T=11 and 12, for car1, 0 in span.\n\nCar2 not at T=11,12.\n\nSo freeway 3 has collision at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \" | 4 | (-12, -23, right, 6), (-48, -59, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6) | \"\n\nYes, identical to freeway 3, so same, collision at T=11,12.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car, (-12,-23,right,6), same as the first car on freeway 3.\n\nSo for freeway 5: car (-12,-23,right,6), so similarly, 0 in span at T=11 and T=12, as above.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, (-12,-23,right,6), collision at T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 7: same, collision T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 8: same, collision T=11,12.\n\nAnd freeway 1 and 2 have collision only at T=10.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway and turn when collision happens if player is there:\n\n- y=1 (freeway 1): collision at T=10\n\n- y=2: collision at T=10\n\n- y=3: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=4: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=5: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=6: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=7: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=8: collision at T=11 and T=12\n\ny=4 is also a freeway? Player starts at y=4 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, player is at y=4.\n\nNow, for y=4, collision at T=11 and 12, but at turn 9, is there collision?\n\nAt turn 9, for freeway 4, with the cars.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: at t_1=9, the spans.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,6), Span(t_1)= [τ,h] = [-23,-12] for right-moving? Earlier.\n\nh=-12, τ=-23, d=right, Span(t_1)= [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=0, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, since -23<0 but -12<0? -12 is negative, so 0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSimilarly, other cars, second car: (-48,-59,right,6), span [-59,-48], all negative.\n\nThird car: (30,19,right,6), span [19,30], positive.\n\nSo at T=9, no car has 0 in span for any freeway? For y=4, at T=9, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1 and 2, at T=9, span [12,47] for left-moving, 12 to 47, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 9, player at y=4, no collision, good.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, safe.\n\nBut to reach there, I need to pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns are when for a freeway, at certain turns, it is occupied at x=0.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At turn 10: y=1 and y=2 are occupied (collision if there)\n\n- At turn 11: y=3,4,5,6,7,8 all occupied\n\n- At turn 12: y=3,4,5,6,7,8 all occupied\n\nAt other turns, no collision for any freeway, I think.\n\nFor example, turn 9: no collision anywhere.\n\nTurn 13: for y=3, at T=13, earlier for car1 on y=3, at ΔT=4, span [1,12], no 0. Car2 at later, etc. So no.\n\nSimilarly, other turns.\n\nSo only turn 10,11,12 have collisions on some freeways.\n\nNow, I start at turn 9, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H=5 if I go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U,U from turn 9 to 13.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nTurn 9: at y=4\n\nAction at turn 9: if I do U, then at turn 10, I move to y=5.\n\nBut at turn 10, if I am on y=5? At turn 10, player position: after action at turn 9, y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9.\n\nIf a_9 = U, then y_{10} = 5.\n\nNow, at turn 10, I am on freeway y=5.\n\nBut at turn 10, for freeway 5, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 5: we have collision only at T=11 and 12, not at T=10.\n\nFor y=5, only collision at T=11 and 12, as above.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, for y=5, no car has 0 in span? Let's confirm.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car, (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nAt T=10, ΔT=1, Span(T) = [-23 +6(1), -12 +6(1)] = [-17,-6], since right-moving, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-23 +6, -12 +6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, since all negative.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at T=10: only y=1 and y=2 have collision at T=10.\n\ny=3 to 8 at T=10: for example y=3, at T=10, ΔT=1, car1 span [-23+6, -12+6]=[-17,-6] no, car2 span [-59+6, -48+6]=[-53,-42] no, car3 [19+6,30+6]=[25,36] no. So no collision at T=10 for y=3-8.\n\nOnly y=1 and 2 at T=10.\n\nSo if at turn 10, I am on y=5, no collision.\n\nThen, if I go up again at turn 10, a_10=U, then y_{11}=6.\n\nAt turn 11, on y=6, and at turn 11, for y=6, there is collision, since y=6 has car, collision at T=11.\n\nSpecifically, for y=6, car (-12,-23,right,6), at T=11, ΔT=2, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], and 0 is included, since -11 <=0<=0? 0 <=0 is true, so yes, collision.\n\nSimilarly for all y=3 to8 at T=11.\n\nSo if I am on y=6 at turn 11, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or go down, but I need to go up.\n\nIn the sequence: if I do U at turn 9, to y=5 at turn 10, safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, if I do U, to y=6 at turn 11, but at turn 11, on y=6, collision.\n\nIf I do S at turn 10, stay at y=5 for turn 11? Action at turn 10: if S, y_{11} = y_{10} + 0 = 5, so at turn 11, on y=5.\n\nBut at turn 11, y=5 has collision, as above.\n\nSimilarly, if D, to y=4 at turn 11, but y=4 also has collision at T=11.\n\nAll y=3-8 have collision at T=11 and 12.\n\nSo at turn 11, if I am on any y from 3 to 8, I collide.\n\nSimilarly turn 12, same.\n\nNow, turn 10: only y=1 and 2 have collision, so y=3-8 are safe at turn 10.\n\nTurn 13 and after, all safe.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nI start turn 9, y=4, safe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=3-8 at turn 11 and turn 12.\n\nBecause those are the only dangerous turns.\n\nAt turn 10, y=3-8 are safe, only y=1,2 dangerous.\n\nSince I am at y=4, I can move to y=5 at turn 10 by going up at turn 9.\n\na_9 = U, then y_{10} = 5.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=5, safe, since no collision at T=10 for y=5.\n\nNow, at turn 10, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up, a_10 = U, then y_{11} = 6, but at turn 11, on y=6, collision.\n\nIf I stay, a_10 = S, y_{11} = 5, at turn 11, on y=5, collision.\n\nIf I go down, a_10 = D, y_{11} = 4, at turn 11, on y=4, collision.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I cannot be on any freeway at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly for turn 12.\n\nSo I need to not be on freeways at turn 11 and 12.\n\nThat means at turn 11, I must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly turn 12.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeway.\n\nNow, I start from y=4 at turn 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go directly, but I have to avoid turn 11 and 12 on freeways.\n\nSo possible to go to y=0 or y=9 at turn 11 and 12.\n\nBut y=9 is the target, so if I can reach y=9 by turn 11 or earlier, but turn 11 is problematic.\n\nLet's list possible positions over turns.\n\nTurn 9: y=4 (start)\n\nAfter action a_9, y_{10} = y_9 + a_9, where a_9 is U, D, S.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need y_{t} for t=10,11,12,...\n\nBut at turn 11 and 12, y_t must be 0 or 9 to avoid collision.\n\nThen after that, I can go to 9.\n\nNow, from turn 9, y=4.\n\nAfter one action, turn 10: y can be 3,4,5 depending on a_9.\n\nIf a_9 = U, y10=5\n\na_9 = S, y10=4\n\na_9 = D, y10=3\n\nAll possible, and all safe at turn 10, since y=3,4,5 are all safe at T=10.\n\nNow at turn 10, I take action to set y11.\n\ny11 must be 0 or 9 to avoid collision at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly for turn 12.\n\nBut y11 depends on y10 and a10.\n\ny11 = y10 + a10, with a10 in {U,D,S}, so y11 can be y10-1, y10, y10+1.\n\ny10 is between 3 and 5, so y11 between 2 and 6.\n\nBut y11 must be 0 or 9, but 2-6 are neither, so impossible to be at 0 or 9 at turn 11 from turn 10.\n\ny10 min 3, max 5.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy, Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y11 between 2 and 6.\n\n0 and 9 are outside, so cannot reach y=0 or y=9 at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 12, same issue.\n\nBut I need to not be on freeway at turn 11, meaning y11 must not be in 1-8, so must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut from y10 in 3-5, y11 cannot be 0 or 9.\n\nContradiction?\n\nPerhaps I misunderstood.\n\nAt turn 11, if y11 is between 1 and 8, and it is a turn with collision for that row, I crash.\n\nBut for rows, collision only at specific turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 11, all rows y=3-8 have collision, so if y11=3,4,5,6,7,8, I crash.\n\ny=1 and y=2 do not have collision at turn 11, only at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 11, for y=1: is there collision?\n\nFreeway 1: we had only at T=10, at T=11, span [-60,-25], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly y=2, same.\n\nAt turn 11, y=1 and y=2 are safe.\n\ny=3 to 8 are dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, same.\n\nAt turn 10, y=1 and 2 dangerous, y=3-8 safe.\n\nSo let's correct:\n\nAt turn 10:\n\n- y=1: collision\n\n- y=2: collision\n\n- y=3: safe (no car at 0)\n\n- y=4: safe\n\n- y=5: safe\n\n- y=6: safe\n\n- y=7: safe\n\n- y=8: safe\n\nAt turn 11:\n\n- y=1: safe\n\n- y=2: safe\n\n- y=3: collision\n\n- y=4: collision\n\n- y=5: collision\n\n- y=6: collision\n\n- y=7: collision\n\n- y=8: collision\n\nAt turn 12:\n\n- y=1: safe\n\n- y=2: safe\n\n- y=3: collision\n\n- y=4: collision\n\n- y=5: collision\n\n- y=6: collision\n\n- y=7: collision\n\n- y=8: collision\n\nAt turn 13 and later, all safe.\n\nNow, player at turn 9: y=4, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nStrategy: I can be on y=1 or y=2 at turn 11 or 12, since they are safe, or on y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is target.\n\nSince at turn 11 and 12, y=3-8 are dangerous, I should avoid being there.\n\nI can be on y=1 or y=2 at those turns.\n\nFrom turn 9, y=4.\n\nI can go down to y=3 or stay or up to y=5 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, all y=3-8 are safe.\n\nSuppose at turn 10, I am at y=3, for example, by doing D at turn 9.\n\na_9 = D, then y10=3.\n\nAt turn 10, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, I need to set y11.\n\nI want y11 to be 1 or 2, since safe at turn 11.\n\nFrom y10=3, if I do D, y11=2\n\nIf S, y11=3, but at turn 11, y=3 has collision, bad.\n\nIf U, y11=4, collision at turn 11.\n\nSo only choice: a_10 = D, to y11=2.\n\nThen at turn 11, on y=2, which is safe, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, I can do actions.\n\nIf I go up, a_11=U, y12=3\n\nBut at turn 12, y=3 has collision, bad.\n\nIf stay, a_11=S, y12=2, at turn 12, y=2 is safe.\n\nIf down, a_11=D, y12=1, safe.\n\nSo I can stay at y=2 or go to y=1.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAfter turn 12, all safe, so I can start moving up.\n\nBut from y=2, to y=9, need to go up 7 times, which takes at least 7 turns.\n\nBut I can be at y=2 at turn 11 and 12, safe.\n\nThen from turn 12 onwards, I can go up.\n\nBut turn 12 is after action at turn 11.\n\nLet's list turns.\n\nTurn 9: start y=4\n\na_9: let's say D, to y10=3\n\nTurn 10: at y=3, a_10: D to y11=2\n\nTurn 11: at y=2, now I need to set y12.\n\nIf a_11 = S, y12=2, safe at turn 12.\n\nOr a_11 = D, y12=1, safe.\n\nOr a_11 = U, y12=3, but at turn 12, y=3 collision, so cannot.\n\nSo at turn 11, I must do S or D to stay at y=1 or 2 for turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 12, after that, I can start moving up.\n\nBut y=9 is far.\n\nSince at turn 10, I can be at higher y.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, a_9 = U, to y10=5\n\nThen at turn 10, y=5, safe.\n\nNow at turn 10, I need to set y11 to safe place.\n\ny11 must be 1 or 2 to be safe at turn 11.\n\nBut from y10=5, y11 = y10 + a10, so 4,5, or 6.\n\nNone of which is 1 or 2; all between 4-6, which are dangerous at turn 11.\n\nCannot reach y=1 or 2 from y=5 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 10, y=4, y11 can be 3,4,5 all dangerous at turn 11.\n\nIf at turn 10, y=3, y11 can be 2,3,4; y=2 is safe, y=3 and 4 dangerous.\n\nSo only from y=3 at turn 10, I can go down to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, if I were at y=2 at turn 10, I could go down to y=1 at turn 11, or stay, but at turn 10, y=2 has collision, so I cannot be at y=2 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, y=2 has collision, so I must avoid y=1 and 2 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, at turn 10, I can only be at y=3,4,5,6,7,8 all safe except y=1,2.\n\nBut among these, only from y=3 I can reach y=2 in one step for turn 11.\n\nFrom y=4, to y=3, but y=3 at turn 11 is dangerous.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf at turn 10, I am at y=3, then a_10 = D, y11=2, safe at turn 11.\n\nIf at turn 10, I am at y=4, then a_10 = D, y11=3, but y=3 at turn 11 collision, bad; a_10=S, y11=4 collision; a_10=U, y11=5 collision. No good.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 10, y=5, same, y11=4,5,6 all collision at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly for higher.\n\nSo only possible to be safe at turn 11 if I am at y=3 at turn 10 and go down to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nI could go to y=1, but from y=3, down to y=2, or to y=1 directly? From y=3, down to y=2, not directly to y=1 in one step? a_10=D, y11=2, which is y=2.\n\nTo y=1, I need to go down twice, but not in one step.\n\nFrom y=3 at turn 10, a_10=D, y11=2.\n\nThen at turn 11, I can go down to y=1 if I want, but not necessary.\n\nSimilarly, I could be at y=8 or something, but I cannot reach y=1 or 2 from there in one step.\n\nSo only option: at turn 10, be at y=3, then a_10=D, to y11=2.\n\nNow, at turn 11, y=2, safe.\n\nNow for turn 12, y12 must be safe at turn 12.\n\ny12 can be set from y11 and a11.\n\ny11=2, a11 can be U, to y12=3; S, to y12=2; D, to y12=1.\n\nAt turn 12, y=3 has collision, so I cannot go to y12=3.\n\ny=2 is safe, y=1 is safe.\n\nSo a11 must be S or D, so y12=2 or 1.\n\nSay I stay at y=2 for both turns.\n\nThen after that, I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 12, to y=9, need 7 up moves, so at least 7 turns: to y=3 at turn 13, y=4 at t14, ..., y=9 at t18? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 12: y=2\n\na_12: U, to y13=3\n\nBut at turn 13, no collision anywhere, so safe.\n\nThen a_13: U, to y14=4\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9 at turn 12 + 7 = turn 19? From y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so 7 actions U, reaching y=9 at turn 12 + 7 = turn 19.\n\nTurn 12: position before action? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t, then I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn 12, I am at y=2.\n\nI take a_12, then y_{13} = y_12 + Δy.\n\nIf a_12=U, y13=3\n\nThen at turn 13, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_13=U, y14=4, and so on, up to a_18=U, y19=9.\n\ny12=2, y13=3, y14=4, y15=5, y16=6, y17=7, y18=8, y19=9.\n\nSo at turn 19, y=9, reached.\n\nBut turn 19 is late, H=10 turns from turn 9? From turn 9 to turn 19, that's 10 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nStart turn 9: y=4\n\nAfter actions from t=9 to t=18, 10 actions, y at turn 19=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from start, I think.\n\nThe sequence: actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 9+H, y=9.\n\nIn the above, if I reach at turn 19, so 9+H=19, H=10.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal 5, but with obstacles, it takes more.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 11 and 12, I can be at y=1 or 2, but I could be at y=9 earlier if possible.\n\nFor example, can I reach y=9 before turn 11?\n\nFrom turn 9, y=4.\n\nIf I go up every turn: a9=U, y10=5\n\na10=U, y11=6, but at turn 11, y=6 collision, not possible.\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\nThen at turn 10, instead of up, I do something else, but I have to set y11 to safe.\n\nBut from y=5, I cannot reach y=1 or 2 in one step.\n\nUnless I go down multiple times, but that takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from turn 9, y=4, a9=D, to y10=3\n\na10=D, to y11=2, safe at turn 11.\n\nThen a11=S, to y12=2, safe at turn 12.\n\nThen from there up, as before.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I should be at a higher y when safe.\n\nFor instance, at turn 10, I can be at y=5 or higher, but from there I have to go down to y=2 for turn 11, which is inefficient.\n\nAt turn 10, the highest I can be is y=5 if I go up from 4.\n\nBut from y=5 at turn 10, I must go down to y=4 or something, but at turn 11, y=4 is dangerous, so I have to go down to y=2, but from y=5 to y=2 takes multiple down moves.\n\nFor example: at turn 10, y=5\n\na10=D, to y11=4, but at turn 11, y=4 collision, invalid.\n\na10=D, y11=4, collision, not possible.\n\nThe only way to be safe at turn 11 is to be at y=1 or 2 at turn 11.\n\nFrom turn 10, if I am at y=3, I can go to y=2 directly.\n\nIf I am at y=2 at turn 10, I can go to y=1 or stay, but at turn 10, y=2 has collision, so I cannot be at y=2 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at turn 10 collision.\n\nSo only possible to be at y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn 10, and only from y=3 I can reach y=2 at turn 11 with one down move.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go down to y=3 at turn 11, but y=3 at turn 11 collision, not safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other way.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid collision at turn 11 is to be at y=2 or y=1 at turn 11, which requires being at y=3 at turn 10 and going down.\n\nSimilarly for turn 12.\n\nBut since I can stay at y=1 or 2 for both turns.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should reach y=9 as soon as possible after turn 12.\n\nSo from turn 12, I should be as high as possible.\n\nAt turn 10, I must be at y=3.\n\nAt turn 9, I start at y=4.\n\nTo be at y=3 at turn 10, I need to go down at turn 9: a9=D, to y10=3.\n\nThen a10=D, to y11=2.\n\nThen at turn 11, I can go down to y=1 or stay at y=2.\n\nTo be higher later, better to stay or go up, but at turn 11, if I go up, to y12=3, but turn 12 collision, cannot.\n\nSo must do S or D at turn 11.\n\nSay a11=S, to y12=2.\n\nThen at turn 12, y=2.\n\nNow from here, I go up repeatedly.\n\na12=U, to y13=3\n\na13=U, to y14=4\n\n...\n\na18=U, to y19=9\n\nSo actions: turn 9: D, turn 10: D, turn 11: S, turn 12: U, turn 13: U, turn 14: U, turn 15: U, turn 16: U, turn 17: U, turn 18: U\n\nThat's 10 actions, reach at turn 19.\n\nBut turn 18 action, y19=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=10.\n\nCan I be at higher y at turn 12?\n\nFor example, at turn 11, instead of staying at y=2, I go down to y=1.\n\nThen a11=D, to y12=1.\n\nThen at turn 12, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up to 9, from y=1, even worse, 8 up moves to y=9 at turn 20, H=11, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2.\n\nBut at turn 10, I am at y=3, but I could be at higher y at turn 10 if possible, but only y=3 is useful because I need to go down to y=2.\n\nWhat if at turn 9, I go up to y=5?\n\nThen at turn 10, y=5.\n\nBut from y=5, I cannot reach y=1 or 2 at turn 11; the best I can do is go down to y=4, but at turn 11, y=4 collision.\n\nIf I go down multiple times, but in one step I can only change by 1.\n\nFor example: at turn 10, y=5, I must take action.\n\na10=D, to y11=4, but at turn 11, y=4 collision, I crash immediately.\n\nNo action from y=5 at turn 10 can make y11 safe, because y11 must be 1 or 2, but from y=5, y11=4,5,6 all dangerous.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 or higher at turn 10 if I want to survive turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, only y=3 at turn 10 allows me to go to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence I have is necessary: go down to y=3 at turn 10, down to y=2 at turn 11, stay or down, better stay, then up repeatedly to 9.\n\nBut H=10.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 12 or earlier, but turn 12 I need to be at y=0 or 9 or 1 or 2, but y=9 is possible if I can reach.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn 9, to y=9, need 5 up moves, but at turn 10,11,12 there are issues.\n\nSuppose I go up at turn 9 to y=5 at turn 10, safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, instead of moving, I stay or something, but at turn 11 I must not be on y=3-8.\n\nBut from y=5, I can only be at y=4,5,6 at turn 11, all dangerous.\n\nUnless I can be at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut from y=5 at turn 10, to y=9 at turn 11? Impossible, since max y11=6.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, I am at y=5, cannot reach y=9 in one step.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 by turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, by turn 12: from turn 9, after 3 actions, y at turn 12.\n\ny12 = y9 + sum of three Δy.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y12 between 1 and 7.\n\ny9=4, so min y12=4-3=1, max 4+3=7.\n\ny=9 is not reachable by turn 12, since 7<9.\n\nSo I must reach after turn 12.\n\nEarliest possible is turn 13 or later.\n\nIn my sequence, I reach at turn 19, but that seems late.\n\nAfter turn 12, all safe, so I can go directly up.\n\nBut from where? In my sequence, I am at y=2 at turn 12, so need 7 up moves.\n\nBut if I can be at higher y at turn 12, I can reach faster.\n\nFor example, can I be at y=7 or 8 at turn 12?\n\nBut at turn 12, to be at high y, I need to have moved up earlier, but at turn 11, I cannot be on y=3-8, so at turn 11, I must be at y=0,1,2,9.\n\ny=9 not reachable, so y=0,1,2.\n\nAt turn 11, y=0,1, or 2.\n\nThen at turn 12, from there, y can be y11-1, y11, y11+1, so if y11=0, y12= -1? But y min 0, I think, since y in [0,9], so y cannot be negative.\n\ny_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=0, D would stay at 0? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} clamped to [0,9].\n\nThe problem says: y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t + Δy <0, y_{t+1}=0, if >9, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nBut in this case, since we start from 4, and go to 9, probably not hit boundary except possibly y=0.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt turn 11, y11 must be 0,1,2.\n\nThen y12 = y11 + a11, so y12 between max(0, y11-1) and min(9, y11+1)\n\nIf y11=0, y12=0 or 1\n\nIf y11=1, y12=0,1,2\n\nIf y11=2, y12=1,2,3\n\nSo y12 at most 3, if y11=2 and a11=U, y12=3.\n\nBut at turn 12, y=3 has collision, so I cannot be at y=3 at turn 12.\n\nTherefore, at turn 12, I must not be on y=3-8, so y12 must be 0,1,2 or 9.\n\nBut from above, y12 <=3, and not 3, so y12=0,1,2.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nIf y11=0, y12=0 or 1\n\nIf y11=1, y12=0,1,2\n\nIf y11=2, y12=1 or 2 (since y12=3 collision, so only S or D to y12=2 or 1)\n\nSo y12 can be 0,1,2.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nFastest: if at turn 12, y=2, then to y=9, need 7 up moves, reach at turn 19.\n\nIf y=1, need 8 moves, worse.\n\ny=0, need 9 moves, worse.\n\nSo best to be at y=2 at turn 12.\n\nIn the sequence, to be at y=2 at turn 12, I can have y11=2 and a11=S, y12=2.\n\ny11=2 how?\n\nAs before, from turn 9: a9=D, to y10=3\n\na10=D, to y11=2\n\nThen a11=S, to y12=2\n\nThen a12=U, to y13=3\n\na13=U, to y14=4\n\na14=U, to y15=5\n\na15=U, to y16=6\n\na16=U, to y17=7\n\na17=U, to y18=8\n\na18=U, to y19=9\n\nSo actions from turn 9 to 18: D, D, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nThat's 10 actions.\n\nH=10, sequence for turns 9 to 18.\n\nBut turn 18 action, position at turn 19.\n\nNow, is there a way to be higher than y=2 at turn 12?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=8 or something, but at turn 12, y=8 has collision, so impossible to be on high freeway at turn 12.\n\nUnless I am at y=9, but cannot reach by then.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to stay at y=2 for both turns; I can move to y=9 during the safe period, but after turn 12, all safe.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 10, I can be at y=8 or something, but then at turn 11, I have to leave to y=1 or 2, but cannot in one step.\n\nFor example, from y=8 at turn 10, to y=2 at turn 11? Impossible, only to y=7,8,9.\n\ny=9 not reachable, y=7 and 8 dangerous at turn 11.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 9: at y=4, action D, to y10=3\n\nTurn 10: at y=3, action D, to y11=2\n\nTurn 11: at y=2, action S, to y12=2\n\nTurn 12: at y=2, action U, to y13=3\n\nTurn 13: at y=3, action U, to y14=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 18: action U, to y19=9\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nTurn 10: at y=3, which is safe at T=10.\n\nTurn 11: at y=2, safe, no collision.\n\nTurn 12: at y=2, safe.\n\nThen turns 13 to 18, moving up, all freeways safe after turn 12.\n\nAt turn 13, y=3, no collision, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo safe.\n\nCan I save one turn?\n\nFor example, at turn 11, instead of staying, if I go up to y=3, but at turn 11, y=3 has collision if I am there, but action at turn 11: if a11=U from y=2, y12=3, but at turn 12, I am on y=3, which has collision at T=12, so I crash.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo down to y=1, but then from y=1 at turn 12, it takes more up moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt turn 10, I could go down to y=2 directly? But from turn 9, y=4, to y=2 at turn 10? Only if I do D, but y10=3, not 2 directly.\n\nCannot change by more than 1.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal number of turns H and the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, I have to output actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=9.\n\nSequence: a9, a10, ..., a18.\n\n10 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by being at y=9 at turn 13 or something.\n\nFor example, if at turn 12, I am at y=2, then to y=9 at turn 13? Impossible, since max y13=3.\n\ny13=3 at best.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 18 or 19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter turn 12, since all safe, I can move up as fast as possible.\n\nBut from y=2, it takes time.\n\nCan I be at higher than y=2 at turn 12?\n\nOnly if I was at higher y at turn 11, but at turn 11, I can only be at y=0,1,2.\n\nIf y11=2, y12 max 3, but y=3 unsafe, so y12<=2.\n\nThus, stuck at y=2.\n\nUnless I am at y=9 at turn 11 or 12, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 5,6,7,8, they have only one car, but same as before.\n\nAnother thought: for freeways with multiple cars, but in this case, for y=5 to 8, only one car each, same as y=3,4? y=3 and 4 have multiple, but the collision times are the same.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: only one car, collision at T=11,12.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=4 for turn 10, but then at turn 10, y=4, I have to go down to y=3 for turn 11? But y=3 at turn 11 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fixed.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, need to box it.\n\nBut let's write the turns.\n\nt_1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = D\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = D\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = S\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nAfter a18, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, with t_1 + t.\n\nIn the action sequence: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a9\n\nt=1: a10\n\n...\n\nt=9: a18\n\nSo 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving up earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 11, after I am at y=2, safe, I could go up at turn 11 to y=3, but at turn 12, y=3 collision, no.\n\nUnless I can be at y=3 at turn 13, which is safe.\n\nBut at turn 12, I have to be safe.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 12, I need to be at y=0,1,2, and I am at y=2, I can go up at turn 12 to y=3, but turn 12 is when I would be on y=3, which has collision, so I must not do that.\n\nSo at turn 12, I must be at y=0,1,2 when I take action? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, then I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t for position y_t.\n\nSo for turn 12, when I am at y_{12}, if y_{12} in 1-8, and collision, I crash.\n\nThen after that, I take a_{12}, to set y_{13}.\n\nIn turn 12, if y_{12} is on freeway and collision, crash before action.\n\nSo I must have y_{12} safe.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 12, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I take U to go to y=3 at turn 13.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIf I could be at y=9 at turn 12, but cannot.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the sequence as required.\n\n**Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nIn the box.\n\nThe actions are for turns 9 to 18, 10 turns.\n\nH=10.\n\nPerhaps I can omit the last U if I reach earlier, but no, I need to specify until the action that makes me reach.\n\nIn this case, I reach at turn 19 after 10 actions.\n\nSince I start at turn 9, position at turn 9, after H actions, at turn 9+H.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal. The collisions occur only at specific turns:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) have collisions at turn 10.\n- Freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) have collisions at turns 11 and 12.\n\nTo avoid collisions, the player must not be on freeways \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10 and not on freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 11 and 12. The only safe positions at turns 11 and 12 are \\(y = 0\\), \\(y = 1\\), \\(y = 2\\), or \\(y = 9\\). However, reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 12 is impossible from the starting position, so the player must be at \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at turns 11 and 12 to avoid collisions.\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n- Moving down to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 10 (safe, as freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe at turn 10).\n- Moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 11 (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) has no collision at turn 11).\n- Staying at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 12 (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) has no collision at turn 12).\n- Moving up repeatedly from turn 13 onwards to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, as all freeways are safe after turn 12.\n\nThis sequence requires 10 actions (turns 9 to 18) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. The actions are:\n\n- Turn 9: Move down (D) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 10 (safe).\n- Turn 10: Move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 11 (safe).\n- Turn 11: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 12 (safe).\n- Turns 12 to 18: Move up (U) repeatedly to increase \\(y\\) from 2 to 9 by turn 19.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as being at a higher \\(y\\) at turn 12 would risk collision or require more moves to reach \\(y = 9\\), and reaching \\(y = 9\\) before turn 19 is infeasible given the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: D \\\\\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

The current turn is t1=10.\n\nFirst, I understand the player movement: they can go up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with given speeds. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you only check collision for the row you're on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t1=10. I need to find the car positions at future turns relative to t1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1, so at turn T = t1 + Δt, the car positions are shifted.\n\nFor left-moving cars: span at T is [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt]\n\nFor right-moving cars: span at T is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nAnd collision if player is on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T is the row, and we care about x=0.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn t1=10.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 6 if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t1 to t1+H-1, that's H actions over H turns, ending at turn t1+H-1 with y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the sequence.\n\nAt turn t1, player is at (0, y_t1) = (0,3)\n\nThen we apply actions a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, position is (0, y_{t1+H})\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after these H actions, at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_t is applied at turn t to move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1 with y_{t1} = 3.\n\nWe apply a_{t1} to get y_{t1+1}, then a_{t1+1} to get y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to a_{t1+H-1} to get y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo H actions to go from turn t1 to turn t1+H with y=9.\n\nMinimal H without cars would be 6, since from 3 to 9 is 6 steps up.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more.\n\nNow, cars are on freeways 1 to 8, and we need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there, but y=9 is the goal, so we need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway with cars; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, let's list the car configurations for each freeway at turn t1=10.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed 36.\n\nSince left-moving, at turn T, span [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt] = [-24 - 36*Δt, 11 - 36*Δt]\n\nFor collision on freeway 1 at turn T, we need 0 in [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt], so min and max depending on order.\n\nSince it's left-moving, and h=-24, τ=11, but usually head is the front, so for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt]\n\nWith h=-24, τ=11, so at t1, span is [-24, 11], so it covers from -24 to 11, which is a long car, length 35, moving left at speed 36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1: [-24,11] left, speed 36.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-6,-17, right, 6), (-42,-53, right, 6), (36,25, right, 6)\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nFor right-moving, span is given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but in the span notation, for right, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nIn the input, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head should be the front when moving right, so for example, first car: head h=-6, tail τ=-17? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nWith values: for freeway 3, first car: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nSo head h = -6, tail τ = -17\n\nBut for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [-17, -6], so from -17 to -6, which is moving right.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-42, -53, right, 6), so τ=-53, h=-42, span [-53,-42]\n\nThird car: (36,25, right,6), τ=25, h=36, span [25,36]\n\nAll right-moving at speed 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3: three cars with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5: one car (-6,-17,right,6), so span [-17,-6] right speed 6.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, freeways 1 and 2 have left-moving cars with span [-24,11] at t1, speed 36.\n\nFreeways 3 and 4 have three cars each: on freeway 3: cars at [-17,-6], [-53,-42], [25,36] all right speed 6.\n\nFreeway 4 same.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 each have one car at [-17,-6] right speed 6.\n\nNow, I need to find when x=0 is covered for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, for each turn, I need to know which freeways are safe to be on.\n\nBut the player can choose to move up, down, or stay, so I need to plan a path from y=3 to y=9 over time, avoiding being on a row when 0 is covered.\n\nAlso, since we start at turn t1=10, and we look at turns T >= t1.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1, so at turn T = t1 + Δt, with Δt >=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and each Δt, I can find if x=0 is covered.\n\nThen for the player, at turn T, if y_T = k for k=1 to 8, and x=0 covered on k at T, collision; else safe.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no collision.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when x=0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (and 2 same): left-moving car, span at T: [ -24 -36*Δt , 11 -36*Δt ]\n\nx=0 covered if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is decreasing.\n\nAt Δt=0, span [-24,11], so 0 is covered since -24 <=0<=11.\n\nWhen does it stop covering 0?\n\nThe left end moves left, right end moves left.\n\n0 covered as long as left end <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nSet -24 -36*Δt <=0 and 11 -36*Δt >=0.\n\n-24 -36*Δt <=0 always true since both negative for Δt>=0.\n\n11 -36*Δt >=0 → 36*Δt <=11 → Δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only for Δt=0, since Δt integer, Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt=0, 11-0=11>=0, and for Δt=1, 11-36= -25 <0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, left end -24-36*Δt <0 always for Δt>=0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, x=0 covered only at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-17 +6*Δt, -6 +6*Δt]\n\nx=0 covered if -17 +6*Δt <= 0 <= -6 +6*Δt\n\nSimilarly, second car: span [-53 +6*Δt, -42 +6*Δt]\n\nThird car: span [25 +6*Δt, 36 +6*Δt]\n\nNow, for each, when 0 covered.\n\nFirst car: -17 +6*Δt <= 0 <= -6 +6*Δt\n\nLeft: -17+6Δt <=0 → 6Δt <=17 → Δt <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so Δt<=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -6 +6Δt → 6Δt >=6 → Δt >=1\n\nSo for Δt=1 and Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, second car: -53 +6Δt <=0 <= -42 +6Δt\n\nLeft: -53+6Δt <=0 → 6Δt <=53 → Δt <=53/6≈8.833, Δt<=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 +6Δt → 6Δt >=42 → Δt >=7\n\nSo for Δt=7,8\n\nThird car: 25 +6Δt <=0 <=36 +6Δt? 25+6Δt >0 always for Δt>=0, so 0 <= 25+6Δt always true, but 25+6Δt <=0? 25+6Δt >=25>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in [25+6Δt, 36+6Δt] since min is 25>0.\n\nSo for freeway 3, x=0 covered:\n\n- by first car for Δt=1 and 2\n\n- by second car for Δt=7 and 8\n\n- not by third car\n\nSo covered at Δt=1,2,7,8\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same as 3.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (-6,-17,right,6), same as first car on freeway 3, so span [-17+6Δt, -6+6Δt]\n\nx=0 covered for Δt=1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8: each has the same car, so covered at Δt=1 and 2.\n\nFreeways 6,7,8 each have one car identical to freeway 5, so yes.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when unsafe (x=0 covered):\n\n- y=1: unsafe at Δt=0\n\n- y=2: unsafe at Δt=0\n\n- y=3: unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8\n\n- y=4: unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8  (same as y=3)\n\n- y=5: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\n- y=6: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\n- y=8: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\ny=3 and y=4 also unsafe at Δt=7,8, but for now.\n\nΔt=0 is turn t1, which is now.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn t1=10, which is Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, for freeway 3, which is y=3, is it unsafe?\n\nAt Δt=0, for y=3, x=0 covered? From above, for y=3, unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8, not at Δt=0.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nFor freeway 3 at Δt=0: first car span [-17,-6], which is all negative, so 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car [-53,-42], 0 not covered.\n\nThird [25,36], 0 not covered.\n\nSo at Δt=0, y=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at Δt=0, but player is at y=3, not on y=1 or 2, so ok.\n\nNow, player at y=3 at turn T=t1 (Δt=0), safe.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path: go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFirst, list all unsafe (y, Δt) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at Δt=0\n\n- y=2: unsafe at Δt=0\n\n- y=3: unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8\n\n- y=4: unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8\n\n- y=5: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\n- y=6: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\n- y=8: unsafe at Δt=1,2\n\nAlso, for y=3 and y=4, unsafe at Δt=7 and 8, which are later.\n\nNow, at Δt=0, player at y=3, safe.\n\nNow, we apply actions starting from a_{t1} for turn t1.\n\nAt turn T=t1 (Δt=0), we choose a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn T=t1+1 (Δt=1), position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, minimal H=6 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if we can do that.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThen:\n\nStart: turn t1=10, Δt=0, y=3, safe (as above)\n\nAfter a_{t1}=U, y_{t1+1} =4 at turn t1+1 (Δt=1)\n\nAt Δt=1, y=4, is it safe? y=4 unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8. Δt=1, so unsafe! Collision if we are on y=4 at Δt=1.\n\ny=4 at turn T with Δt=1, which is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo if we go to y=4 at Δt=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or go down, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt Δt=1, y=3 is also unsafe, since y=3 unsafe at Δt=1.\n\ny=3 unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8.\n\nSo at Δt=1, both y=3 and y=4 are unsafe.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at Δt=1 and 2.\n\nWhat about y=0 or y=9? But we are at y=3 now.\n\nAt Δt=1, which rows are safe?\n\ny=1: unsafe only at Δt=0, so at Δt=1, safe? y=1 unsafe only at Δt=0, so for Δt>=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2: unsafe only at Δt=0, so for Δt>=1, safe.\n\ny=1: unsafe at Δt=0 only, so for Δt=1,2,... safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2.\n\ny=3: unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8, so at Δt=1, unsafe.\n\ny=4: same.\n\ny=5: unsafe at Δt=1,2, so at Δt=1, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 all unsafe at Δt=1.\n\nNow y=0 and y=9 are always safe, but y=0 is below.\n\nAt Δt=1, safe rows are y=0, y=1, y=2, y=9? y=9 no car, but we are not there yet.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe at Δt=1.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nWe need to choose action at turn t1 (Δt=0) to go to y_{t1+1}.\n\nIf we go up to y=4, at turn t1+1 (Δt=1), y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down to y=2, at turn t1+1 (Δt=1), y=2, which is safe, since y=2 unsafe only at Δt=0.\n\nIf we stay, y=3 at Δt=1, unsafe.\n\nSo only down to y=2 is safe for the next turn.\n\nThen from y=2, we can go up or down.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nAlso, later at Δt=7 and 8, y=3 and 4 are unsafe, but we might not be there.\n\nFirst, let's list for each Δt, which rows are safe.\n\nΔt=0: safe rows: y=0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? y=1 and 2 unsafe, others should be safe.\n\ny=3 at Δt=0 safe, as we saw.\n\ny=4 at Δt=0: for freeway 4, at Δt=0, similar to y=3, not covered, so safe.\n\ny=5: at Δt=0, car on y=5 is [-17,-6] at t1, 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 all safe at Δt=0.\n\ny=0 and 9 safe.\n\nSo at Δt=0, unsafe: y=1,2\n\nSafe: y=0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nBut player at y=3.\n\nΔt=1: unsafe rows: y=3,4,5,6,7,8 (all covered as above)\n\ny=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, etc.\n\ny=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nSo safe rows at Δt=1: y=0,1,2,9\n\nΔt=2: similar, unsafe: y=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nSafe: y=0,1,2,9\n\nΔt=3: now, what about Δt=3?\n\nFor y=3: unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8, so at Δt=3, not listed, so safe?\n\nSimilarly, y=4 same.\n\ny=5: unsafe only at Δt=1,2, so at Δt=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly all y=3 to 8 should be safe at Δt=3, except for y=3 and y=4 at later Δt.\n\nAt Δt=3:\n\ny=1: always safe for Δt>0\n\ny=2: always safe for Δt>0\n\ny=3: unsafe at Δt=1,2,7,8, so at Δt=3, safe\n\ny=4: same, safe at Δt=3\n\ny=5: unsafe at Δt=1,2, so at Δt=3, safe\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at Δt=3\n\ny=0,9 safe.\n\nSo at Δt=3, all rows safe.\n\nSimilarly for Δt=4,5,6: all should be safe, since no unsafe times listed except for specific.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at Δt=7,8, but for Δt=3 to6, safe.\n\ny=5 to8 unsafe only at Δt=1,2, so for Δt>=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and2 always safe for Δt>=1.\n\nNow Δt=7: y=3 and y=4 unsafe, others safe.\n\nΔt=8: same, y=3 and4 unsafe.\n\nΔt=9 and later: all safe again, since no more unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at Δt=7, y=3 and4 unsafe because of the second car on freeways 3 and4.\n\nAt Δt=7, for freeway 3, second car covers x=0, similarly for y=4.\n\nBut for other rows, safe.\n\nSimilarly at Δt=8.\n\nNow back to the player.\n\nAt turn t1 (Δt=0), y=3 safe.\n\nWe need to choose action to go to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 (Δt=1)\n\nAt Δt=1, only safe rows are y=0,1,2,9\n\nBut y=9 is far, we are at y=3, so we can only go to y=2 or y=1 or y=0 or stay but y=3 unsafe, so not stay.\n\nActions: U to y=4, but y=4 unsafe at Δt=1, so collision.\n\nD to y=2, which is safe at Δt=1.\n\nS to y=3, unsafe.\n\nSo only possible safe action is D to y=2.\n\nSo at turn t1, action must be D.\n\nThen at turn t1+1 (Δt=1), y=2, which is safe.\n\nNow, at turn t1+1 (Δt=1), we need to choose action for y_{t1+2}.\n\nAt Δt=1, y=2 safe.\n\nNow, for turn t1+2 (Δt=2), what rows are safe.\n\nAt Δt=2, unsafe rows: y=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nSafe: y=0,1,2,9\n\nNow, from y=2, we can go to y=1, y=3, or stay y=2.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe at Δt=2, so cannot go to y=3.\n\ny=2 at Δt=2 is safe, since y=2 unsafe only at Δt=0.\n\ny=1 safe.\n\nSo possible actions: D to y=1, S to y=2, or U to y=3 but unsafe.\n\nSo we can stay at y=2 or go down to y=1.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nIf we stay at y=2, at turn t1+2 (Δt=2), y=2 safe.\n\nThen at turn t1+3 (Δt=3), all rows are safe, as we said.\n\nThen we can go up freely.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, from above:\n\nAfter first action D, at turn t1+1 (Δt=1), y=2.\n\nNow at turn t1+1, we choose a_{t1+1} to go to y_{t1+2}.\n\nFor y_{t1+2} at turn t1+2 (Δt=2).\n\nAt Δt=2, safe rows: y=0,1,2,9\n\nSo we can only be on y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nFrom current y=2, we can:\n\n- S: stay y=2, safe\n\n- D: to y=1, safe\n\n- U: to y=3, unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo we must stay at y=2 or go down to y=1.\n\nIf we go down to y=1, then at y=1, but we need to go up later.\n\nSince at Δt=3, all safe, we can start going up.\n\nBut let's minimize turns.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 for now, then at Δt=3, go up.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t1 (10): action D, to y=2 at turn 11 (Δt=1)\n\nNow at turn 11 (Δt=1), we need to choose action for turn 12.\n\nIf we choose S: stay at y=2, then at turn 12 (Δt=2), y=2, safe.\n\nThen at turn 12, we choose action for turn 13 (Δt=3).\n\nAt Δt=3, all rows safe, and y=2, we can go U to y=3 at turn 13.\n\nThen from there go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, we need to reach it.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 12 (Δt=2), after action U, y_{13} =3 at turn 13 (Δt=3).\n\ny=3 at Δt=3 is safe, as established.\n\nThen we can go up each turn to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nNow, from y=3 at turn 13, to y=9, need 6 steps: to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut at Δt=3, turn 13, y=3.\n\nTurn 13: Δt=3, y=3, safe.\n\nApply U: to y=4 at turn 14 (Δt=4)\n\nΔt=4: all safe, y=4 safe.\n\nU to y=5 at turn 15 (Δt=5), safe.\n\nU to y=6 at turn 16 (Δt=6), safe.\n\nU to y=7 at turn 17 (Δt=7)\n\nNow Δt=7, y=7: is it safe?\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, which has cars, but at Δt=7, y=7 unsafe? Earlier we have y=7 unsafe only at Δt=1 and 2.\n\nAt Δt=7, for y=7: freeway 7 has one car, same as y=5, etc., unsafe only at Δt=1,2.\n\nAt Δt=7, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, all rows except y=3 and y=4 are safe at Δt=7.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at Δt=7.\n\nBut y=7 at Δt=7: freeway 7, car at [-17+6*Δt, -6+6*Δt] at T.\n\nAt Δt=7, span [-17+42, -6+42] = [25,36], which is positive, 0 not covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at Δt=7: span [-17+42, -6+42]=[25,36], safe.\n\ny=3 at Δt=7: unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSo at turn 17 (Δt=7), y=7, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at turn 18 (Δt=8)\n\nΔt=8, y=8: freeway 8, car [-17+48, -6+48]=[31,42], 0 not covered, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn 19 (Δt=9)\n\ny=9, no car, safe, and we reached.\n\nNow, let's list the turns and actions.\n\nStart: turn t1=10, y=3\n\nAction a10: D, so to y=2 at turn 11\n\nTurn 11: y=2, action? We need to choose for turn 12.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn, we choose the action.\n\nAt turn 11 (y=2, Δt=1), we choose action to go to y_{12}.\n\nAt turn 12 (Δt=2), we need to be on a safe row.\n\nAs above, we can choose S to stay at y=2.\n\nThen at turn 12 (Δt=2), y=2, safe.\n\nThen at turn 12, choose action for turn 13.\n\nWe choose U to go to y=3 at turn 13 (Δt=3)\n\nThen at turn 13 (y=3), choose U to y=4 at turn 14 (Δt=4)\n\nThen U to y=5 at turn 15 (Δt=5)\n\nU to y=6 at turn 16 (Δt=6)\n\nU to y=7 at turn 17 (Δt=7)\n\nU to y=8 at turn 18 (Δt=8)\n\nU to y=9 at turn 19 (Δt=9)\n\nNow, H: from turn 10 to turn 19, that's 10 turns? Let's count.\n\nActions from a10 to a18? Turn t1=10 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nActions: a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16, a17, a18 → that's 9 actions.\n\nThen y19=9.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nt1+H =10 + H =19, so H=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe could go down to y=1 earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 10: D to y=2 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, instead of staying, go down to y=1.\n\nAction D to y=1 at turn 12 (Δt=2)\n\ny=1 at Δt=2 is safe, since y=1 safe for Δt>0.\n\nThen at turn 12 (y=1), we can go up.\n\nBut at Δt=2, y=1 safe, but if we go U to y=2, y=2 is safe at Δt=2, or directly, but from y=1 to y=2.\n\nThen at turn 13 (Δt=3), all safe, go up.\n\nBut similar, we start from lower position.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 10: D to y=11? Turn 11: y=2\n\nTurn 11: action D to y=1 at turn 12\n\nTurn 12: y=1, at Δt=2, safe.\n\nThen turn 12: action U to y=2 at turn 13 (Δt=3)\n\nThen U to y=3 at turn 14 (Δt=4)\n\nU to y=4 at turn 15 (Δt=5)\n\nU to y=5 at turn 16 (Δt=6)\n\nU to y=6 at turn 17 (Δt=7)\n\nU to y=7 at turn 18 (Δt=8)\n\nU to y=8 at turn 19 (Δt=9)\n\nU to y=9 at turn 20 (Δt=10)\n\nThat's 10 actions: a10 to a19, y20=9, H=10, worse than before.\n\nAfter turn 12 at y=1, at turn 12 action U to y=2 at turn 13.\n\nThen from y=2 at turn 13, same as before, to y=9 in 7 more steps? y=2 to y=9 is 7 steps: to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn previous with stay, from y=2 at turn 12, to y=3 at 13, to y=4 at14, ..., to y=9 at19, that's 7 actions from turn 12 to 18, y19=9.\n\nActions: turn12: U to y13=3, turn13: U to y14=4, ..., turn18: U to y19=9.\n\nFrom turn 12 to 18, 6 actions? Let's list:\n\nAt turn 12: y=2, action U, to y=3 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: y=3, action U, to y=4 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: y=4, action U, to y=5 at turn 15\n\nTurn 15: y=5, U to y=6 at 16\n\nTurn 16: y=6, U to y=7 at 17\n\nTurn 17: y=7, U to y=8 at 18\n\nTurn 18: y=8, U to y=9 at 19\n\nSo actions from turn 12 to 18: 7 actions, but turn 12 action to turn 13, up to turn 18 action to turn 19.\n\nNumber of actions: turn12,13,14,15,16,17,18: 7 actions for y from 2 to 9, but starting from y=2 at turn 12, after action, y13=3, so to reach y=9 at turn 19, it takes 6 ups from y=3? y13=3 to y19=9, that's 6 steps: 14,15,16,17,18,19? y at turn t.\n\ny13=3, y14=4, y15=5, y16=6, y17=7, y18=8, y19=9. So from turn 13 to turn 19, 6 turns, but 6 actions: actions at turn13 to turn18.\n\nIn the sequence, we have earlier actions.\n\nBack to first sequence:\n\nTurn 10 (t1): action D, to y11=2\n\nTurn 11: action S (stay), to y12=2\n\nTurn 12: action U, to y13=3\n\nTurn 13: U to y14=4\n\nTurn 14: U to y15=5\n\nTurn 15: U to y16=6\n\nTurn 16: U to y17=7\n\nTurn 17: U to y18=8\n\nTurn 18: U to y19=9\n\nSo actions: D at10, S at11, U at12, U at13, U at14, U at15, U at16, U at17, U at18 → 9 actions, y19=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut can we avoid staying?\n\nAt turn 11 (y=2, Δt=1), instead of staying, we could go down to y=1, but that might take longer.\n\nSince at Δt=3 all safe, we could go up earlier if possible.\n\nBut at Δt=1 and 2, we cannot be on y=3 to 8.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 10, go down to y=2.\n\nThen at turn 11, go down to y=1.\n\nThen at turn 12 (Δt=2), y=1 safe.\n\nThen at turn 12, we can go up to y=2 at turn 13 (Δt=3)\n\nThen up to y=3 at 14, etc., same as before but from lower, takes one more action.\n\nTurn 10: D to y11=2\n\nTurn 11: D to y12=1\n\nTurn 12: U to y13=2\n\nTurn 13: U to y14=3\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 19: U to y20=9? y19=8? Let's see.\n\ny13=2, y14=3, y15=4, y16=5, y17=6, y18=7, y19=8, y20=9, so to y20=9, H=10 actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt turn 12, y=1, at Δt=2, we could go directly to y=2, but still.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but going down then up takes more turns.\n\nSo the first sequence seems best with H=9.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=9 at an earlier turn, but with cars, we have to wait at y=2 for two turns? In the sequence, we have to stay at y=2 during Δt=1 and Δt=2.\n\nAt turn t1+1 (11) and t1+2 (12), we are at y=2, both safe.\n\nThen at t13, go up.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 before turn 19?\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately after Δt=2.\n\nBut from y=3 at Δt=0, we have to go down to avoid being on high rows at Δt=1 and 2.\n\nAnother thought: at Δt=0, y=3 safe, but we cannot stay or go up at next because y=4 at Δt=1 unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=2 at Δt=1.\n\nThen at Δt=1, y=2, we could go to y=1 or stay, but not up.\n\nThen at Δt=2, if we are at y=1 or y=2, safe, then at Δt=3, go up.\n\nBut to go from y=2 to y=9, it takes 7 steps: to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, so from turn 13 to 19, as before.\n\nMinimal possible: if no cars, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 turns: actions U from turn 10 to 15, y16=9.\n\nBut with cars, at turn 11, if we go to y=4, unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo we must be on low rows during Δt=1 and 2.\n\nThe earliest we can start going up is from turn 13 (Δt=3).\n\nAt turn 13, y must be between 0 and 9, and we can go up to y=9.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at turn 13, then to y=9 in 7 steps, arrive at turn 20? No.\n\nAt turn 13, position y13.\n\nAfter k up actions, y_{13+k} = y13 + k.\n\nSet y13 + k =9, so k=9 - y13.\n\nThen turn number t = 13 + k = 13 + 9 - y13.\n\nWe want to minimize t, so maximize y13.\n\nAt turn 13 (Δt=3), we can be at y=2, as in the sequence.\n\nCan we be higher at turn 13?\n\nAt turn 13, y13 is determined by previous actions.\n\nAt turn 12 (Δt=2), we must be on a safe row: y=0,1,2,9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible yet.\n\nSo y12 can be 0,1,2.\n\nThen at turn 12, we apply action to go to y13.\n\nIf y12=2, we can go U to y13=3, or S to y13=2, or D to y13=1.\n\nSimilarly, if y12=1, go U to y13=2, S to1, D to0.\n\nIf y12=0, go U to y13=1, etc.\n\nAt turn 13, y13 can be up to 3 if we go from y12=2 to y13=3.\n\nBut y12=2 is possible, as in the sequence.\n\ny12=2, then U to y13=3.\n\nThen y13=3.\n\nThen to y=9, need 6 steps: y14=4,15=5,16=6,17=7,18=8,19=9.\n\nSo arrive at turn 19.\n\nIf at turn 12, we are at y=1, then to y13=2, then y14=3, etc., arrive later.\n\nSimilarly, if we can be at y=3 at turn 13, that's the highest.\n\nBut at turn 12, if we are at y=2, we can go to y=3 at turn 13.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=3 at turn 13?\n\nYes, as above.\n\nBut at turn 13, y=3, and Δt=3, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we have y13=3.\n\nNow, but we have to consider later unsafe times, but in this case, from turn 13 onwards, we go up, and at Δt=7 and 8, which are turn 17 and 18, we are at y=7 and y=8, which are safe, as we saw.\n\ny=7 at Δt=7: turn t1+7=17, y=7, freeway 7, car span [-17+6*7, -6+6*7]=[-17+42, -6+42]=[25,36], 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at Δt=8: turn 18, y=8, car [-17+48, -6+48]=[31,42], safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, with H=9, we reach at turn 19.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=8?\n\nSuppose we reach at turn 18, y18=9.\n\nThen turn 18 is t1+8, since t1=10, 10+8=18, so H=8 actions? t1+H=18, so H=8.\n\ny_{t1+H} = y18=9.\n\nAfter 8 actions from turn 10 to 17.\n\ny start at 10: 3\n\nAfter a10, y11\n\n...\n\nAfter a17, y18=9.\n\nSo y18=9.\n\nNow, from y10=3 to y18=9, net change +6, so possible with 6 ups and 2 other actions, but since we can stay or down, but to minimize time, we want as many up as possible.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\ny18=9, so the position at each turn.\n\nNow, turn 11 (Δt=1): must be on safe row, y=0,1,2,9\n\nBut y=9 not possible, so y11=0,1, or2\n\nSimilarly turn 12 (Δt=2): y12=0,1,2,9\n\nNow, y10=3\n\na10: to y11, which must be 0,1,2\n\nSimilarly, from y11 to y12, must be 0,1,2 or9, but y=9 unlikely so 0,1,2\n\nThen at turn 13 (Δt=3), y13 can be anything, and we need to reach y18=9.\n\nFrom y13 to y18 in 5 steps: y13 to y14, y15, y16, y17, y18.\n\ny18=9, so y13 + Δy =9, where Δy is the net change over 5 actions.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,1, so max increase 5, min decrease 5.\n\nTo reach 9, y13 <=9, and since we start from low, y13 probably low.\n\ny13 min: if we go down, but we want to go up.\n\ny13 at least 0.\n\nIf y13=4, then we need +5 in 5 steps, so all U, y14=5,15=6,16=7,17=8,18=9.\n\nSimilarly if y13=5, need +4, possible with U and some S or D, but S or D would require more steps, so to reach in 5 steps, we need exactly the increase.\n\ny18 - y13 must be between -5 and 5, but since we go to 9, y13 between 4 and 14, but y<=9, so y13 between 4 and9.\n\nIf y13=4, then all U to 9 in 5 steps.\n\ny13=5, then +4, so four U and one S or D, but S or D would make net less, so to have net +4 in 5 steps, must have four U and one S, or three U and two S, etc., but net +4 with five actions: possibilities: four U and one D? Four U and one D: net +3, not +4.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nNet change: number U minus number D.\n\nWith k actions, net Δy = U_count - D_count, and U_count + D_count + S_count = k.\n\nΔy = U_count - D_count\n\nAlso, y_final = y_initial + Δy\n\nHere from turn 13 to 18, y13 to y18, 5 actions.\n\ny18 = y13 + (U_count - D_count)\n\nSet y18=9, so y13 + U_count - D_count =9\n\nBut U_count + D_count + S_count =5\n\nSo y13 + U_count - D_count =9\n\nSince U_count <=5, D_count >=0, etc.\n\ny13 <=9, so U_count - D_count =9 - y13 >=0\n\nAlso U_count <=5, D_count <=5.\n\nNow, to have y18=9, we need U_count - D_count =9 - y13\n\nSince y13 <=9, 9-y13 >=0.\n\nIf y13=4, then U_count - D_count =5\n\nBut U_count <=5, D_count >=0, so U_count=5, D_count=0, S_count=0, all U.\n\nSimilarly, if y13=5, U_count - D_count=4\n\nWith 5 actions, possible: U_count=4, D_count=0, S_count=1; or U_count=5, D_count=1, but U_count=5, D_count=1, net +4, but U_count + D_count + S_count=6>5, impossible with 5 actions.\n\nU_count + D_count + S_count =5\n\nNet Δy = U_count - D_count\n\nIf y13=5, Δy=4, so U_count - D_count=4\n\nThen U_count = D_count +4\n\nThen (D_count +4) + D_count + S_count =5 → 2 D_count + S_count =1\n\nSince D_count >=0, S_count>=0, possible: D_count=0, S_count=1, U_count=4; or D_count=1, S_count=-1 impossible; so only D_count=0, S_count=1, U_count=4.\n\nSimilarly, if y13=6, Δy=3, U_count - D_count=3, U_count = D_count +3, then (D_count+3) + D_count + S_count=5 → 2 D_count + S_count=2, so possibilities: D_count=0, S_count=2, U_count=3; or D_count=1, S_count=0, U_count=4; etc.\n\nBut with extra S or D, it might be slower in terms of position, but we need to reach exactly at turn 18.\n\nBut in terms of time, since we have fixed steps, higher y13 better.\n\nBack to constraints.\n\nAt turn 11 (Δt=1), y11 must be in {0,1,2}\n\nAt turn 12 (Δt=2), y12 must be in {0,1,2}\n\ny10=3\n\na10: to y11, so y11 = y10 + Δy10, Δy10 = -1,0,1\n\nBut y11 must be 0,1,2, and y10=3, so possible: D to y11=2, or S to y11=3, but y11=3 not allowed at Δt=1, since unsafe. Similarly U to y11=4 not allowed.\n\nSo only D to y11=2.\n\nThus y11=2.\n\nThen at turn 11, a11 to y12.\n\ny12 must be in {0,1,2} for Δt=2.\n\nCurrent y11=2, so can S to y12=2, or D to y12=1, or U to y12=3 but not allowed.\n\nSo y12=1 or 2.\n\nThen at turn 12, a12 to y13.\n\nNo restriction on y13, all safe.\n\nNow, we want y18=9.\n\nWith 5 actions from turn 13 to 17? Actions at turn 13,14,15,16,17 to go to y14,15,16,17,18.\n\ny13 to y18 in 5 steps.\n\ny13: since y12 is 1 or 2, and a12 to y13.\n\nIf y12=2, then a12: U to y13=3, S to y13=2, D to y13=1\n\nIf y12=1, U to y13=2, S to y13=1, D to y13=0\n\nSo y13 can be 1,2,3 if y12=2; or 0,1,2 if y12=1.\n\nMax y13=3.\n\nThen to y18=9, need net +6 from y13, but only 5 actions, max increase +5, so impossible to reach y18=9 if y13<=3.\n\ny13<=3, y18=9, so need +6, but with 5 actions, max Δy=+5, so y18 <= y13 +5 <=3+5=8 <9, cannot reach y18=9.\n\ny13 <=3, y13 +5 <=8, so y18<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus impossible to reach at turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, for any earlier turn.\n\nFor example, turn 17: y17=9, but turn 17 is t1+7=17, H=7? t1+H=17, H=7.\n\ny17=9.\n\nThen from y10=3 to y17=9 in 7 actions? Actions a10 to a16, y17=9.\n\nNow, turn 11 (Δt=1): y11 must be 0,1,2\n\nTurn 12 (Δt=2): y12 must be 0,1,2\n\ny10=3, a10 to y11, only possible y11=2.\n\nThen a11 to y12, y12=1 or 2.\n\nThen a12 to y13, y13 as above.\n\nThen from y13 to y17 in 4 actions: y13 to y14,y15,y16,y17.\n\ny17=9, so y13 + Δy =9 with 4 actions.\n\nMax y13=3, then max y17=3+4=7<9, impossible.\n\ny13<=3, +4 max to 7<9.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 16: y16=9, even worse.\n\nSo minimal reachable turn is turn 19 with y19=9, as before.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to stay at y=2 for one turn? In the sequence, at turn 11, we have y=2, and we choose S to stay at y=2 for turn 12.\n\nWe could at turn 11 go down to y=1, but then y12=1, then to y13=2 or something, but y13 lower, takes more steps to go up.\n\nFor example, y12=1, then to y13=2, then y14=3, etc., to y19=8? y18=8 if start from y13=2 with 5 ups: y13=2, y14=3,15=4,16=5,17=6,18=7, then y19=8? 5 actions to y18=7, need one more to y19=9? Messy.\n\ny13=2, after 5 actions: y18=2 + U_count - D_count.\n\nTo reach high, but y18=9, so U_count - D_count =7, with 5 actions impossible.\n\nEarlier for turn 19.\n\nSo the sequence with stay is fine.\n\nNow, about the later unsafe times: in our sequence, at Δt=7 and 8, turn 17 and 18, we are at y=7 and y=8, which are safe, and y=3 and 4 are unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence is:\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd y19=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so t=10 to 18.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nt1=10\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = D\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = S\n\nTurn t1+2: a_{t1+2} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+8: a_{t1+8} = U? t1+H-1=10+9-1=18, so turn 18.\n\nActions from t=10 to 18.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have 9 actions.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut at turn 18, action U to y19=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could have at turn 12 go directly, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 11, we could go down to y=1, but then we need to come back, taking more time.\n\nFor example, if at turn 11 go to y=1, then at turn 12, we can go to y=2 (since Δt=2, y=2 safe), then at turn 13 go to y=3, etc., but y12=1 or 2, then y13=2 or 3, then to y19=9, same or later.\n\nWith y12=1, y13=2, y14=3, ..., y19=9? y13=2 to y19=9 is 6 steps: y14=3,15=4,16=5,17=6,18=7,19=8? Actions: at turn13 to y14, ..., at turn18 to y19.\n\nFrom y13=2 to y19=9: 6 actions needed.\n\ny13=2, y14=3 (a13=U), y15=4 (a14=U), ..., y19=9 (a18=U), so actions at turn13,14,15,16,17,18: six actions for six steps.\n\nBut we start from turn10.\n\nTurn10: D to y11=2? Earlier.\n\nIf at turn11: from y11=2, action D to y12=1\n\nThen turn12: action U to y13=2\n\nThen turn13: U to y14=3\n\nTurn14: U to y15=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn18: U to y19=9? y14=3, y15=4, y16=5, y17=6, y18=7, y19=8, not 9.\n\ny13=2 at turn13, after a13=U, y14=3; a14=U, y15=4; a15=U, y16=5; a16=U, y17=6; a17=U, y18=7; a18=U, y19=8; need a19=U to y20=9.\n\nSo more actions.\n\nThus, the first sequence with stay is better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with the sequence above.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is never on a freeway row (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) at a turn when a car covers \\(x = 0\\) on that row.\n\n### Key Constraints from Car Movements:\n- **Freeways 1 and 2**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (where \\(\\Delta t = T - t_1\\), \\(T\\) is the turn).\n- **Freeways 3 and 4**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 1, 2, 7, 8\\).\n- **Freeways 5 to 8**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 1, 2\\).\n- At \\(\\Delta t = 0\\), the player starts at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe.\n- At \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 2\\), the only safe rows are \\(y = 0, 1, 2, 9\\).\n- At \\(\\Delta t \\geq 3\\), all rows are safe except:\n  - \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 7, 8\\).\n\n### Action Sequence Rationale:\n- **Turn 10 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\))**: Player at \\(y = 3\\) (safe). Must move to a safe row for \\(\\Delta t = 1\\). Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) or staying at \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\). Moving down to \\(y = 2\\) is safe for \\(\\Delta t = 1\\). Action: \\(D\\).\n- **Turn 11 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\))**: Player at \\(y = 2\\) (safe). Must move to a safe row for \\(\\Delta t = 2\\). Moving up to \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe. Staying at \\(y = 2\\) or moving down to \\(y = 1\\) is safe. Staying minimizes vertical deviation. Action: \\(S\\).\n- **Turn 12 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\))**: Player at \\(y = 2\\) (safe). All rows are safe for \\(\\Delta t = 3\\). Move up to start ascending. Action: \\(U\\).\n- **Turns 13 to 18 (\\(\\Delta t = 3\\) to \\(8\\))**: All rows are safe except \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 7, 8\\), but the player is not on these rows during unsafe times. Move up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently. Actions: \\(U\\) each turn.\n\n### Sequence Verification:\n- **Turn 10 (\\(t_1\\))**: Action \\(D\\), position to (0, 2) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(S\\), position to (0, 2) at turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: Action \\(U\\), position to (0, 3) at turn 13.\n- **Turn 13**: Action \\(U\\), position to (0, 4) at turn 14.\n- **Turn 14**: Action \\(U\\), position to (0, 5) at turn 15.\n- **Turn 15**: Action \\(U\\), position to (0, 6) at turn 16.\n- **Turn 16**: Action \\(U\\), position to (0, 7) at turn 17.\n- **Turn 17**: Action \\(U\\), position to (0, 8) at turn 18.\n- **Turn 18**: Action \\(U\\), position to (0, 9) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence reaches (0, 9) at turn 19 (\\(t_1 + H = 10 + 9 = 19\\)) with \\(H = 9\\) turns. No collision occurs, as:\n- At \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) and \\(2\\), the player is on \\(y = 2\\) (safe).\n- At \\(\\Delta t = 7\\) and \\(8\\), the player is on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeways 7 and 8 are only unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 1, 2\\)).\n\nA sequence with \\(H < 9\\) is impossible, as the constraints at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) and \\(2\\) force the player to be on a low row (\\(y \\leq 2\\)) during these turns, delaying the ascent.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, same y). The player must stay within y in [0,9]. Since we start at y=2 and need to get to y=9, we have to move up by 7 units. Each U move increases y by 1, so at minimum we need 7 U moves. However, we may have to wait (S) or even move down (D) to avoid cars.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway at that turn has 0 in its span. Note that when the player moves from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, at that turn T the player is still on the original row y. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on the new row.\n\nCar update rules:\n- Left-moving cars: span moves left (decreasing x) with speed s per turn. The span at time T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n- Right-moving cars: span moves right (increasing x) with speed s per turn. The span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=11.\n\nLet me write the car states at turn t1=11:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> left-moving, so at time t1=11, the car spans from -60 to -25. Since it's moving left at 36 per turn, at time T (>=11) the span is [-60 - 36*(T-11), -25 - 36*(T-11)].\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): same as freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> same update.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): three cars: \n  (0, -11, right, 6) -> right-moving: at t1=11, head=0, tail=-11. Since right, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the representation for right is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right, the head is the right end and tail is the left end. So at t1=11: [tail, head] = [-11, 0]. Then at time T, the car moves right: so the new span is [ -11 + 6*(T-11), 0 + 6*(T-11) ].\n  Similarly, the other two on freeway 3:\n  (-36, -47, right, 6) -> this representation: head=-36? But wait, for a right-moving car, the head should be the right end. However, here head=-36 and tail=-47, which is consistent because -36 > -47. So the span at t1=11 is [ -47, -36 ]? Actually, the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning that the tail is the left and head is the right. But here the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So I think the first number is always the head and the second the tail. For right, head is the right end and tail is the left end. So the car at t1: head=-36, tail=-47 -> so the car is from x=-47 to x=-36? But that would be a length of 11? Then moving right: at time T, [ -47 + 6*(T-11), -36 + 6*(T-11) ].\n  Similarly, (42, 31, right, 6): head=42, tail=31 -> so at t1: from 31 to 42. Then at T: [31+6*(T-11), 42+6*(T-11)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right: \"Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\", and tau is the tail (left end) and h is the head (right end). So the formula is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 (y=4): same as freeway 3: three cars with the same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): one car: (0, -11, right, 6) -> at T: [ -11+6*(T-11), 0+6*(T-11) ]\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): same.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same.\n\nOur player starts at y=2 at turn 11. We need to move from y=2 to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 7 (if we could move up every turn). But we must avoid being on a freeway (y=1 to 8) at a turn when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nNote: at the moment of moving, the player is on the starting row during the entire turn. For example, at turn T, if we are at row y and we choose to move up (U), then at turn T we are on row y (so we check cars on row y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, we are on row y+1.\n\nWe are to plan from turn 11 onward.\n\nLet me denote the time from the current turn (t1=11) as relative time t=0 (meaning turn 11 is t=0, turn 12 is t=1, etc.). Then at relative time t (which is absolute time 11+t), the player position is y(t). We start at y(0)=2.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for t=0 to H-1 such that y(H-1)=9? Actually, note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1 (i.e., H moves) and then at the end of the H-th turn (i.e., after H moves) we are at y(0+H) = 9? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and after that action we are at y(t1+H-1)=9.\n\nIn terms of relative time:\n- At relative time 0 (turn 11): we are at y(0)=2, and we choose an action a0 (which is a_{11}) that will determine y(1) (at turn 12).\n- Then at relative time 1 (turn 12): we choose a1 -> y(2) at turn 13.\n- ...\n- After H actions (from t=0 to t=H-1), we have y(H) = 9? But note: the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y(t1+H-1) = y(0 + (H-1) + 1) = y(H). Actually, the player update is: at turn T, we do an action that affects the next state: y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta y_T.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". Let me clarify:\n\nWe start at turn t1 (11) at position (0,2). Then we take an action a_{t1} (at turn t1) which will determine y_{t1+1}. Then we take a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, which determines y_{t1+2}, and so on. We want that at some turn T = t1+H-1, we have y_T = 9. That is, after (H-1) actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2) we are at turn t1+H-1 and y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (i.e., H actions) and the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1. However, the position after that last action is y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta y_{t1+H-1}. But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. So the last action does not change the position? Actually, no: the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9? Or at the end?\n\nActually, the state is given at the start of turn t1. Then during turn t1 we take an action, and then at the start of turn t1+1 we are at the new position. So the position is updated at the start of the next turn.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). And then we do not require any further action? Actually, the sequence has H actions, meaning from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the start of turn t1+H we would be at a new position? But the problem says we only care about being at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, note that the collision condition: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T) and we check the cars on freeway y_T at that turn. So if we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we are on freeway 9? But freeways are only from 1 to 8. The goal is (0,9) which is above freeway 8. So when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway. Therefore, we don't have to check for cars at y=9.\n\nBut note: the requirement is to avoid collisions only on freeways (y=1..8). So when we are at y=0 or y=9, no car collision.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=9 at the start of some turn. And we don't care about what happens after that.\n\nSo the plan: we start at turn 11 (relative t=0) at y=2. We take an action at turn 11 that will lead to y at turn 12. Then at turn 12 we take an action that leads to y at turn 13, and so on until at the start of some turn T (which is t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H (the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so H is the number of actions? Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And then the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions? But note: the turn at which we are at y=9 is t1+H-1. So the total number of turns elapsed (from start to the turn we reach) is H-1? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning that H is the number of turns we are taking actions? And we take H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1) and then at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? Actually, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the start of turn t1+H we are at a new position? But the problem says: after the sequence of actions we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo let me clarify the timeline:\n\n- Turn t1 (11): start at y=2. Then we take action a_{11}. Then we move to the next state: at the start of turn 12, we are at y_{12} = y_{11} + Delta y_{11}.\n- Turn 12: we are at y_{12}. Then we take action a_{12}, and then at the start of turn 13 we are at y_{13} = y_{12} + Delta y_{12}.\n- ...\n- We want that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the last action is taken at turn t1+H-2? Because the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1? That doesn't seem to match.\n\nThe problem states: \n- We are to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to turn t1+H-1. So the actions are for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (total H actions).\n\nAfter taking the action at turn t1+H-1, the state is updated to the next turn: turn t1+H. But we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? That would be before taking the action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement is that at the start of the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1) we are at 9? But then we don't need to do anything? And we would have taken H-1 actions to get to that state? Then why have an action at turn t1+H-1?\n\nI think there is a confusion. Let me reread:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that for t from 0 to H-1, the action at turn t1+t. So the turns are: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the condition is: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". But note: y_{t} is the position at the start of turn t. Then at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action will change the position to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta. So we don't want that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that after taking the sequence of H actions, the position at the start of the next turn (turn t1+H) is 9? But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nLooking back: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\". And the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. Then at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take the action at turn t1+H-1? But that action would then move us away? \n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9). We are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action? But the problem doesn't require to stay there, it only requires to reach at that turn. And then we are done? However, the action at that turn might move us away, but that doesn't matter because we have already reached at the start of that turn.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions\" at every turn we are on a freeway. At turn t1+H-1, if we are at y=9, then we are not on a freeway (since freeways are 1-8). So no collision check. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? That action might move us to y=10? But that's not allowed because y must be in [0,9]. Or we can take an action that keeps us at 9? But the problem doesn't require to stay, only to reach at the start of that turn.\n\nHowever, the minimal H: we want the smallest H such that we can be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. And we have to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: if we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we have to take an action at that turn. But that action could be anything? However, we must avoid going out of bounds: if we are at 9 and we choose U, then y_{t1+H} = 10, which is invalid. So we must choose either D or S at that turn? But if we choose D, then we leave the goal. So we must choose S? Then we stay at 9.\n\nBut the problem does not require to stay beyond that turn. However, the action at the turn we reach must be chosen such that we don't go out of bounds. So if we are at 9, we cannot choose U. We can choose S (or D, but that would move us away). But note: the goal is only to be at 9 at the start of that turn. Then we can choose D? But that would move us to 8 at the next turn, which is not the goal. However, the problem doesn't say we have to stay. But the condition is only at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So we can then move away? But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action we are at 9? But then the condition should be that the last action leads to 9. That is, after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H. But the condition is written as y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding in the indexing.\n\nLet me look at the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo the position at turn t+1 is determined by the action at turn t.\n\nWe are at turn t1: y_{t1}=2.\nWe take action a_{t1}: then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\n\nWe want to have y_{??} = 9.\n\nThe problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSet T = t1+H-1. Then we require y_T = 9.\n\nBut y_T is the position at the start of turn T. How did we get there? By the action at turn T-1: y_T = y_{T-1} + Delta y_{T-1}.\n\nTherefore, the last action that affects the position is at turn T-1 = t1+H-2.\n\nThen at turn T = t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we are required to take an action at turn T (which is the last action in the sequence, the H-th action). But that action doesn't change the fact that we are at 9 at the start of that turn. And we can choose S to stay at 9? Or even D to go down? But the goal is already achieved at the start of turn T. So we can choose any action that is valid? But note: if we choose U at y=9, we go to 10 which is invalid. So we must choose D or S.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that we must remain at 9, so we can choose D? That would move us to 8 at the next turn, but the goal condition is already met at the start of turn T. So it's acceptable.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we can choose S at the last turn.\n\nBut note: the minimal H: we want the smallest H such that we can be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. The sequence of actions includes H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to get from 2 to 9 is 7 moves (each U). So the earliest we can be at 9 is at the start of turn 11+7 = 18? Because:\n\n- Start turn11: y11=2.\n- After action at turn11: y12 = 2 + (if U) 3.\n- ...\n- After the 7th U (at turn17): y18 = 2+7 = 9.\n\nSo at the start of turn18, we are at 9. Then we must take an action at turn18? That would be the 8th action? Then H=8? Because we take 8 actions: at turns 11,12,...,18.\n\nBut note: the turn at which we are at 9 is turn18 = t1+7. Then t1+H-1 = 11+H-1 = 10+H = 18? Then H=8.\n\nBut we only did 7 upward moves. So why 8 actions? Because the last action is at the turn we are already at 9. So we need to account for the turn when we are at 9? But the condition is that at the start of turn18 we are at 9, and then we take an action at turn18 (the 8th action).\n\nAlternatively, if we can be at 9 earlier? We start at 2: we can get to 9 in 7 moves, so the earliest arrival is at the start of turn18. Then H must be 8.\n\nBut we might have to wait sometimes, so it might take more than 7 moves.\n\nSo we are to find the minimal H (number of actions) such that we can be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is at least 8 (because we need 7 moves to get from 2 to 9, and then one extra action at the arrival turn).\n\nBut actually, we don't necessarily need an extra action: because the goal condition is at the start of turn t1+H-1. If we can arrange that at the start of turn t1+7 = 18 we are at 9, then we have taken 7 actions (from turn11 to turn17) and then we must also include the action at turn18? That would be the 8th action.\n\nThe problem says: the sequence has H actions, and then at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So:\n\nWe are at turn t1: we take action0 -> then at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = ... \n...\nWe take action_{H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then after that action, we have y_{t1+H} = ... but we don't care? The condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at that turn? But that action does not affect the position at the start of turn t1+H-1, it affects the next state.\n\nTherefore, the last action that sets the position to 9 is the action at turn t1+H-2: that action sets y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Delta.\n\nSo to be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, we must have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us to 9.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 and we take an action (which could be S, for example).\n\nSo the number of actions: we have H actions. The last action (the H-th action) is taken at turn t1+H-1, but that action is taken when we are already at 9 and it doesn't help us get there. It is only because the sequence must cover until the turn we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H: we need at least 7 upward moves to get from 2 to 9. The minimal number of actions is 7 if we could arrive at turn t1+7 = 18 and then not have to take an extra action? But according to the problem, the sequence must include the action at the turn when we are at 9. So we have to include that turn. Therefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nBut if we can arrive earlier? We start at turn11 at y=2. The next turn is turn12. The earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn11+7=18. So we cannot arrive earlier than turn18.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut we might have to take detours (wait or even move down) to avoid cars, so H might be more than 8.\n\nWe want the minimal H (which is at least 8) and a sequence of 8 actions that gets us to y=9 at the start of turn18 (i.e., after 7 actions) and then at turn18 we take an action (which can be S).\n\nBut the condition is that at the start of turn18 we are at 9. The actions we take at turn11 to turn17 will get us to 9 at turn18, and then we take an action at turn18.\n\nNow, we must avoid collisions at every turn from turn11 to turn17 (inclusive) when we are on freeways (y=1..8). Note: at turn18 we are at y=9, so no collision check.\n\nAlso, at turn11 we are at y=2 (freeway2), then we move to y=3 at turn12, etc.\n\nWe have to simulate the car positions at each turn from 11 to 17 for the freeways we will be on.\n\nThe player's path: we start at y=2 at turn11. We need to go to y=9. We can only move up to 1 per turn, so the path in terms of y will be increasing (unless we move down to avoid a car). But moving down would cost extra moves, so we want to avoid that.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H, so we try to do it in 8 turns (H=8) if possible.\n\nSo the plan: we take 7 U moves and 1 S move? Or maybe we have to wait sometimes. The 1 S move would be to avoid a car at a particular turn.\n\nBut we start at y=2 at turn11. We want to be at y=9 at turn18.\n\nThe path of y:\n\nturn11: y=2\nturn12: y=3 (if we go up at turn11)\nturn13: y=4\nturn14: y=5\nturn15: y=6\nturn16: y=7\nturn17: y=8\nturn18: y=9  -> but at the start of turn18 we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the action at turn17: if we are at y=8 at the start of turn17, and we take U, then at the start of turn18 we are at 9.\n\nSo we need to take U at turns11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Then at turn18 we take S (or D, but S is safe).\n\nThat is 7 U's and then at turn18 an S. Total H=8 actions.\n\nBut we must check that at every turn from 11 to 17 (inclusive) we are not colliding with a car on the freeway we are on.\n\nSo we need to check for each turn T from 11 to 17 and for the row y we are on at that turn, whether the car on that row (if any) has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nWe are at:\n- turn11: y=2 -> freeway2\n- turn12: y=3 -> freeway3\n- turn13: y=4 -> freeway4\n- turn14: y=5 -> freeway5\n- turn15: y=6 -> freeway6\n- turn16: y=7 -> freeway7\n- turn17: y=8 -> freeway8\n\nNow, we check each:\n\n1. turn11 (T=11), freeway2: car state at T=11: given: (-60, -25, left, 36). So the span at T=11: [ -60 - 36*(0), -25 - 36*(0) ] = [-60, -25]. Is 0 in [-60, -25]? No. So safe.\n\n2. turn12 (T=12), freeway3: freeway3 has three cars. We need the span of each car at T=12 (which is relative time t= T - t1 = 12-11=1).\n\nCar1: (0, -11, right, 6) -> at T=12: [ -11 + 6*(1), 0 + 6*(1) ] = [-5, 6]. 0 in [-5,6]? Yes! So collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway3 at turn12 if we go directly.\n\nSo the naive path fails at turn12.\n\nWe need to avoid that collision. How?\n\nAt turn12, we are at freeway3 and there is a car covering 0.\n\nOptions:\n- We can delay our upward move at some turn to avoid being at freeway3 at turn12.\n- Or we can take a detour (move down at some point) to avoid that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we try to do it in 8 turns. That means we can only have one extra move (like one S or one D) that might delay us by one turn. But if we delay by one turn, then we arrive at turn19, so H would be 9.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it in 8 by adjusting the path.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid being at freeway3 at turn12 by not moving up at turn11? Then at turn12 we would still be at y=2 (if we do S at turn11) or at y=1 (if we do D at turn11). But then we are still on freeway2 or freeway1 at turn12, and then we can move up later.\n\nBut then we need to make up for the lost move.\n\nSo we might need 8 moves to get to 9? Then we would arrive at turn19 (start of turn19) at y=9. Then we take an action at turn19? So H=9.\n\nBut let's try to see if we can do it in 8 turns (H=8) by choosing a different path.\n\nWe must be at y=9 at the start of turn18. That means we need to have moved up 7 times in the 7 turns from turn11 to turn17. So we must have taken 7 U's in 7 moves? And then an 8th move at turn18.\n\nBut the moves are at turns11,12,...,17, and then turn18. The moves at turns11 to17 determine our position at turns12 to18.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn18, we must have taken 7 U's at some of the turns from 11 to 17. But we have 7 moves (turns11 to17) and we must take exactly 7 U's? Because each U moves up by one. But we start at 2 and need to get to 9: 7 moves. So we have to take U at every move from turn11 to17. We cannot take a detour and still get there in 7 moves? Because any detour (like moving down) would require an extra move to compensate.\n\nTherefore, if we must be at 9 at turn18, we must take U at every move from turn11 to17. But we saw that at turn12 we collide.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to do it in 8 turns (H=8). We must take more than 7 upward moves? No, we need exactly 7 upward moves. But we have to avoid the collision, so we must not be at freeway3 at turn12.\n\nHow can we avoid being at freeway3 at turn12? We can be at a different row at turn12. But if we take U at turn11, we must be at 3 at turn12. The only way is to not take U at turn11. Then we would be at 2 or 1 at turn12.\n\nBut then we have only 6 moves left (turns12 to17) to go from 1 or 2 to 9: we need 7 or 8 moves? So we cannot make it by turn18.\n\nTherefore, we must delay our arrival.\n\nMinimal H would be 9: then we arrive at turn19 (start of turn19) at y=9. Then we take an action at turn19.\n\nSo the sequence has 9 actions: turns11 to19.\n\nWe have 8 moves to get from 2 to 9: we need 7 U's and one extra move that is either S or D. But if we do D, we have to compensate with an extra U, so it would be 8 U's and one D? That would be 9 moves? Or we can do 7 U's and one S: that is 8 moves (actions) and then we arrive at turn19.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nWe start at turn11: y=2.\n\nWe have 8 actions from turn11 to turn18. We want to be at y=9 at the start of turn19? No, we want to be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1 = 11+9-1 = 19.\n\nSo at the start of turn19, we are at y=9.\n\nHow many upward moves do we need? From 2 to 9: 7. We have 8 moves (from turn11 to turn18) to do it. So we can take 7 U's and one S.\n\nNow, we can use the S to avoid a collision.\n\nWe have to avoid the collision at freeway3 at turn12. So if we do not move up at turn11, then at turn12 we are still at y=2 (if we do S) or at y=1 (if we do D). Then at turn12, we can move up to y=3 (if we were at 2) or to y=2 (if we were at 1).\n\nBut if we do S at turn11, then at turn12 we are at y=2. Then we can take U at turn12 to go to y=3 at turn13.\n\nThen our path:\n\nturn11: y=2 -> freeway2\nturn12: y=2 (because we did S at turn11) -> freeway2\nturn13: y=3 (U at turn12) -> freeway3\nturn14: y=4\nturn15: y=5\nturn16: y=6\nturn17: y=7\nturn18: y=8\nturn19: y=9 (if we do U at turn18) -> but we want to be at y=9 at the start of turn19? Yes.\n\nBut at turn19 we are at y=9, and then we take an action at turn19 (the 9th action).\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nturn11: freeway2: car at T=11: [-60,-25] -> no 0, safe.\nturn12: freeway2: car at T=12: \n  The car on freeway2: (-60,-25, left, 36). At T=12: [ -60 -36*(12-11), -25-36*(1) ] = [-96, -61]. 0 not in there. Safe.\n\nturn13: freeway3: at T=13 (which is 13-11=2 relative time)\n  Car1: (0,-11,right,6) -> [ -11+6*2, 0+6*2] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? But 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-36,-47,right,6) -> [ -47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in there.\n  Car3: (42,31,right,6) -> [31+12,42+12]=[43,54] -> safe.\n\nSo safe at turn13.\n\nturn14: freeway4: same cars as freeway3? The table says freeway4 has the same three cars. At T=14 (relative time 3):\n  Car1: [ -11+6*3, 0+18] = [-11+18,18] = [7,18] -> no 0.\n  Car2: [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29, -18] -> no.\n  Car3: [31+18,42+18]=[49,60] -> no.\n\nturn15: freeway5: car is (0,-11,right,6) -> at T=15 (relative time 4): [ -11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> no 0.\n\nturn16: freeway6: same as freeway5 -> at T=16 (relative time 5): [ -11+30, 30] = [19,30] -> no.\n\nturn17: freeway7: at T=17 (relative time 6): [ -11+36, 36] = [25,36] -> no.\n\nturn18: freeway8: at T=18 (relative time 7): [ -11+42, 42] = [31,42] -> no.\n\nThen at turn19: we are at y=9 (no car check).\n\nSo this works.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nAt turn11: S (because we stay at y=2)\nAt turn12: U (to y=3 at turn13)\nAt turn13: U (to y=4 at turn14)\nAt turn14: U (to y=5 at turn15)\nAt turn15: U (to y=6 at turn16)\nAt turn16: U (to y=7 at turn17)\nAt turn17: U (to y=8 at turn18)\nAt turn18: U (to y=9 at turn19) -> but wait, we want to be at y=9 at the start of turn19? Actually, by taking U at turn18, we go from y=8 (at the start of turn18) to y=9 at the start of turn19. That is what we want.\n\nThen at turn19: we have to take an action? Yes, the 9th action. We are at y=9, so we can take S (to stay at 9) or D (to go to 8). Since we don't care after, we can take S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn11: S\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: S\n\nBut H=9.\n\nIs there a way to do it in H=8? We saw that with the direct U's we collide at turn12. And if we skip one U at turn11, we don't get to 9 by turn18. So no.\n\nBut what if we take a detour? For example, at some point we move down to avoid a car? But then we would need extra moves.\n\nFor example, suppose we do:\n\nAt turn11: U -> to y=3 at turn12 -> but then at turn12 we collide on freeway3.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, at turn11: D -> then at turn12: y=1. Then we are on freeway1 at turn12.\n\nCheck freeway1 at turn12: car is (-60,-25,left,36) -> at T=12: [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn12: U -> to y=2 at turn13? But we started at 2, went down to 1, then up to 2: we are back at 2. Then we have to make up the lost moves. We need 7 U moves from 2 to 9. But we have used 2 moves to go down and up and we are still at 2. Then we need 7 more U moves: total 9 moves. Then we arrive at turn20? So H=10? Worse.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut wait, in the sequence above with one S we did it in 9 actions (H=9).\n\nBut we could try to use the S at a different time? For example, instead of at turn11, we use S at a later turn to avoid a collision? But the only collision we have in the direct path is at turn12 on freeway3. If we can avoid being at freeway3 at turn12, then we are good. But if we take U at turn11, we are at freeway3 at turn12. So we must not take U at turn11.\n\nBut if we take S at turn11, we are safe at freeway2 at turn12. Then we take U at turn12 to go to freeway3 at turn13, which we saw was safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? In the original direct path, after freeway3, the freeways 4 to 8 were safe at the planned turns. But in this new path, we are at freeway3 at turn13 (instead of turn12), freeway4 at turn14, etc. And we checked that at freeway3 at turn13 it is safe.\n\nBut note: the car positions change with time. We must check every step.\n\nWe already did: it was safe.\n\nBut is there a collision at a later freeway because of the shift? For example, at freeway5 at turn15 (in the shifted path) we have relative time 4, and we checked [13,24] -> safe. Similarly for others.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut we used 8 moves (from turn11 to turn18) to go from y=2 to y=9? Actually, we did:\n\n- turn11: S -> y12 = 2\n- turn12: U -> y13 = 3\n- turn13: U -> y14 = 4\n- turn14: U -> y15 = 5\n- turn15: U -> y16 = 6\n- turn16: U -> y17 = 7\n- turn17: U -> y18 = 8\n- turn18: U -> y19 = 9\n\nSo we did 7 U's and one S. We arrived at y=9 at the start of turn19. Then we need to take an action at turn19 (the 9th action).\n\nTotal actions: 9.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 8? We need to be at 9 at the start of turn18. That requires 7 U's in the moves at turns11 to17. But we cannot do that without colliding at turn12.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to be at freeway3 at a different turn? But if we go up at turn11, we are there at turn12 and it's bad. If we go up later, we don't have enough moves.\n\nWhat if we go up twice quickly? For example, we cannot move up twice in one turn.\n\nAnother idea: at turn11, we take U -> then at turn12 we are at y=3 (and collide). But if at turn12 we take D? Then we go back to y=2 at turn13. Then we have lost two moves: one U and one D, so we are still at 2 at turn13. Then we need 7 moves from there: arrive at turn20. H=10.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without the S at the beginning? For example, if we do U at turn11, we collide at turn12. So we must avoid that.\n\nWe could do S at a different turn? But the collision is at turn12. The only way to avoid being at freeway3 at turn12 is to not be at 3 at turn12. So if we are at 2 or 4 at turn12.\n\nTo be at 4 at turn12: we start at 2. We would have to move up twice: but we can only move once per turn. So we cannot be at 4 at turn12.\n\nTo be at 2: we do S or D at turn11.\n\nSo the only option is to be at 2 at turn12.\n\nTherefore, we must do either S or D at turn11.\n\nD: then at turn12 we are at 1. Then we are on freeway1 at turn12. We checked: safe. Then we can do U at turn12 to go to 2 at turn13, and then we are behind. We would need 7 moves from 2 to 9: from turn13 to turn19: that would be 7 moves, arriving at turn20. So H=10.\n\nBut if we do S at turn11, we are at 2 at turn12, then we do U at turn12 to go to 3 at turn13. Then we only lost one move. Then we do 6 more U's to go to 9 at turn19. So we did 7 U's and one S: total 8 moves? But we have 8 moves from turn11 to turn18, and then we are at 9 at turn19. Then we need an action at turn19? So total 9 actions.\n\nBut the moves:\n\n- turn11: S -> position at turn12: 2\n- turn12: U -> turn13: 3\n- turn13: U -> turn14: 4\n- turn14: U -> turn15: 5\n- turn15: U -> turn16: 6\n- turn16: U -> turn17: 7\n- turn17: U -> turn18: 8\n- turn18: U -> turn19: 9\n\nSo we have taken 8 actions: at turn11 to turn18. Then we are at 9 at turn19. Then we are required to take an action at turn19? But the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we have H actions. We want to be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSet t1+H-1 = 19 -> 11+H-1=19 -> H=9.\n\nSo we have 9 actions: from turn11 to turn19.\n\nThe last action (turn19) is taken when we are at 9. We can choose S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn11: S\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: S\n\nBut note: at turn18 we are at y=8 (start of turn18), and we take U to go to y=9 at turn19. Then at turn19 we take S to stay.\n\nIs there a way to combine and avoid the last S? But we must output H actions, and we must be at 9 at the start of turn19, which is after 8 actions. Then the 9th action is at turn19.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at 9 earlier? For example, at the start of turn18? But we saw that we cannot.\n\nBut what if we do an extra U somewhere? For example, if we start at 2, and we do U at turn11 -> collide at turn12. So no.\n\nOr if we do two U's in a row later? But we are already doing U's.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at 9 at turn19 with only 8 actions? Then we would not need the 9th action? But the condition: we are at 9 at the start of turn19, which is turn t1+8 (since 11+8=19). Then t1+H-1=19 -> 11+H-1=19 -> H=9. So we must have 9 actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, we must output the sequence.\n\nBut note: we have a car on freeway2 at turn12? We checked: safe.\n\nAnd we checked all the freeways along the path.\n\nBut wait: at turn13 we are at freeway3: we have three cars. We checked at T=13 (relative time 2): \n  car1: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  But what about the other cars? They don't cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut wait: the car representation: for the right-moving car (0,-11,right,6): at T=13, the span is [ -11+6*(13-11)= -11+12=1, 0+12=12]. So [1,12]. 0 is not in [1,12]. Safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway3 at T=12 was [ -5,6] which did include 0. But we are at freeway3 at T=13, not T=12.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut let me write it in the answer format.\n\nWe have H=9, so we output 9 actions: for turn11 to turn19.\n\nTurn11: S\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo t from 0 to 8 (since H-1=8). Then:\n\na_{t1+0} = a_{11} = S\na_{11+1}=a_{12}=U\n...\na_{11+8}=a_{19}=S\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut note: at turn19 we are at y=9, and we take S. We could also take D? But that would move us to 8, which is not necessary. But the problem doesn't require to stay. However, taking U would move us to 10, which is invalid. So we must take S or D. S is safe and keeps us at 9.\n\nBut the problem does not specify, so we can take S.\n\nTo be precise, the minimal sequence is this.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9 that uses a D? But that would be inefficient. We don't need to.\n\nWe could avoid the S at turn19? But we have to take an action at turn19, and we are at 9, so we cannot avoid it.\n\nBut we can take D at turn19? It would be:\n\n... \nTurn18: U  -> then at turn19: we are at 9 (start). Then we take D at turn19 -> then at turn20 we are at 8. But the goal condition is met at the start of turn19, so it's acceptable. But why would we? S is simpler.\n\nSo we output S at turn19.\n\nBut let me check if we can do without the S at the beginning? For example, if we do U at a different time? We have to avoid the collision at turn12.\n\nWhat if we do S at turn12? But if we do U at turn11, we are at 3 at turn12 and collide. So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, if we do U at turn11, then at turn12 we are at 3 and collide. Then we cannot do anything.\n\nSo the only safe option is to do S at turn11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut let me check freeway1 and freeway2 again at the beginning.\n\nAt turn11: freeway2: car at T=11: [-60,-25] -> safe.\nAt turn12: freeway2: car at T=12: [-60-36, -25-36] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen we move to freeway3 at turn13: safe.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says: when you move to a different freeway, at the turn of the move, you are still on the original freeway. So when we are at turn12 (at freeway2) and we take U, then at turn13 we are at freeway3. So at turn12, we are at freeway2 and we check freeway2. We did.\n\nSimilarly, at turn13 we are at freeway3 and we check freeway3.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=9.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=8? We thought not, but let me see if we can arrive at turn18 at y=9 without the initial S.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\nAt turn11: we cannot take U because then we collide at turn12.\n\nWhat if we take D at turn11? Then at turn12: y=1. Then at turn12: we take U to y=2 at turn13. Then we are at 2 at turn13. Then we need 7 moves to 9: so at turn20 we would be at 9. Then H=10.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt turn11: S -> then at turn12: y=2. Then we take U at turn12 to y=3 at turn13. Then we are at 3 at turn13. Then we need 6 more U's: at turn14:4, turn15:5, turn16:6, turn17:7, turn18:8, turn19:9. So we need to go to turn19. So we cannot be at 9 at turn18.\n\nBut what if we take two U's in a row at some point? We can only do one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, if we do U at turn11 and then at turn12 we are at 3 and collide. Then we die.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 2\\) for one turn to avoid a collision on freeway \\(y = 3\\) at turn 12, then moving up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 19.\n\n- At turn 11, staying at \\(y = 2\\) (action S) avoids moving to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 12, where a collision would occur due to a car on freeway 3 spanning \\([-5, 6]\\) (which includes 0).\n- From turns 12 to 18, moving up (action U) each turn progresses the player from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 19.\n- At turn 19, staying (action S) ensures the player remains at \\(y = 9\\) without moving out of bounds.\n\nThe car positions at each relevant turn are verified to not include 0 in their spans on the freeway occupied by the player:\n- Turn 11 (\\(y = 2\\)): car span \\([-60, -25]\\) (no 0).\n- Turn 12 (\\(y = 2\\)): car span \\([-96, -61]\\) (no 0).\n- Turn 13 (\\(y = 3\\)): car spans \\([1, 12]\\), \\([-35, -24]\\), \\([43, 54]\\) (no 0).\n- Turn 14 (\\(y = 4\\)): car spans \\([7, 18]\\), \\([-29, -18]\\), \\([49, 60]\\) (no 0).\n- Turn 15 (\\(y = 5\\)): car span \\([13, 24]\\) (no 0).\n- Turn 16 (\\(y = 6\\)): car span \\([19, 30]\\) (no 0).\n- Turn 17 (\\(y = 7\\)): car span \\([25, 36]\\) (no 0).\n- Turn 18 (\\(y = 8\\)): car span \\([31, 42]\\) (no 0).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t₁=12.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars on the freeways move left or right at given speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where the span includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe player updates position after the action, so when you move, you're not on the new row until the next turn. That means if you move up or down at turn T, at turn T you're still on the old row, and at turn T+1 you're on the new row. So for collision, at turn T, we check the row y_T for cars with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nThe player position at turn t is (0, y_t). At turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nIf y_T is 0 or 9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we need to end at (0,9), which is safe.\n\nCurrent position: (0,2) at t=12.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 7 units up. But I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe actions are U (up, +1), D (down, -1), S (stay, 0). And y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9. Since we start at 2 and go to 9, down might not be useful, but it could be to avoid cars, I suppose.\n\ny is from 0 to 9 inclusive, so 10 rows, but freeways are only y=1 to 8, y=0 and 9 have no cars.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at t=12.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: one car, head 48, tail 83, direction left, speed 36. Direction left means it's moving left, so span decreases.\n\nAt turn t, for left-moving car, span is [h - s(t - t₁), τ - s(t - t₁)]\n\nt₁ is 12, so let's define τ = t - t₁, the number of turns since now.\n\nSo at time T = t₁ + τ, for a car with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at t₁.\n\nIn the table, for each car, it gives (h, τ, d, s). But τ is tail, which might be confusing with time, but in context, it's the tail position.\n\nI'll use \"tail_pos\" to avoid confusion.\n\nSo for freeway 1: car: head=48, tail=83, d=left, s=36.\n\nBut head and tail: for left-moving, head is the front? Direction left, so if it's moving left, head should be the left end? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t₁) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nAt t₁, span is [h, τ]. Since it's moving left, if h is head, and it's decreasing, so if h > τ, then [h, τ] might not be standard if h > τ, but positions.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: head=48, tail=83. 48 to 83, but if moving left, and head=48, tail=83, 48 < 83, but moving left, so the head is at smaller x? Let's think.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the head is the front, which has smaller x if x increases to the right.\n\nBut here, span is given as [h, τ], and for left-moving, it becomes [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], so if h < τ, then [h, τ] is from low to high, and moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, so 48 to 83, which is from left to right? But direction is left, so moving left, meaning decreasing x.\n\nAt t₁, it's from x=48 to x=83. Moving left at speed 36 per turn? Speed s=36, but per turn? That seems fast, but okay.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is the same: head=48, tail=83, left, s=36.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars: (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h]? From the rule: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, it says: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ]\n\nIn the text: \"Right-moving: [Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t₁), h + s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nYes, so for right-moving, at t₁, span is from τ to h, and since moving right, both increase.\n\nFor example, first car on k=3: τ= -5, h=6? Span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-5, 6], so from -5 to 6, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ= -41, h= -30? [τ, h] = [-41, -30], moving right.\n\nThird car: τ=37, h=48, [37,48], moving right.\n\nAnd s=6 for all on k=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as k=3: (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: only one car: (6,-5,right,6) so [τ,h] = [-5,6], moving right, s=6\n\nFreeway 6: same, (6,-5,right,6) so [-5,6], right, s=6\n\nFreeway 7: same, (6,-5,right,6) [-5,6], right, s=6\n\nFreeway 8: same, (6,-5,right,6) [-5,6], right, s=6\n\nFor freeways 5 to 8, only one car each, all the same: span at t₁ is [-5,6], moving right at s=6.\n\nNow, freeways 1 and 2 have one car each: for k=1: [48,83] left, s=36\n\nk=2: [48,83] left, s=36\n\nk=3 and k=4 have three cars each, but for collision, we care about when 0 is in the span for that freeway at the relevant time.\n\nSince the player is at (0,y), we care about x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, at each turn, we need to know if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince multiple cars, but for collision, if any car on the row has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nBut for each freeway, we can find the times when x=0 is covered.\n\nLet τ = t - t₁, so τ=0 is now.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time τ, is there a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThen for the player, when on that row at that time, collision if covered.\n\nPlayer at time T (which is τ after t₁) is on row y_{t₁ + τ}.\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T.\n\ny_T depends on actions.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=2 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a row y=1-8 when x=0 is covered for that row at that turn.\n\nSince the grid is only x=0, and cars move, but we only care about x=0 point.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, left-moving, span at τ=0: [48,83]\n\nSpan at time τ: [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36τ\n\nSo 48 - 36τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 83 - 36τ\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36τ ≤ 0 => 36τ ≥ 48 => τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 83 - 36τ => 36τ ≤ 83 => τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for τ from 4/3 to 83/36, approximately τ=1.333 to 2.305\n\nSince τ integer, τ=2 only? τ must be integer because turns are discrete.\n\nτ is turn offset, integer.\n\nτ=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, span [12,47], 0 not in, since 12>0\n\nτ=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, span [-24,11], -24 ≤ 0 ≤ 11? 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nτ=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, span [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2, x=0 covered on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same car, same everything, so only at τ=2 covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span at τ=0: [τ,h] = [-5,6], so [-5,6], moving right, s=6.\n\nSpan at τ: [ -5 + 6τ, 6 + 6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -5 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 6 + 6τ\n\nFirst: -5 + 6τ ≤ 0 => 6τ ≤ 5 => τ ≤ 5/6 ≈ 0.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 6 + 6τ, which is always true for τ≥0.\n\nSo -5 + 6τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 6 + 6τ\n\n0 ≤ 6 + 6τ always true since τ≥0.\n\nSo only need -5 + 6τ ≤ 0 => τ ≤ 5/6\n\nSince τ integer, τ ≤ 0.833, so τ=0 only? τ=0: -5 +0 = -5 ≤0, 0≤6, yes.\n\nτ=1: -5+6=1, 6+6=12, span [1,12], 0 not <=1, 0<1, so not covered.\n\nτ=0: span [-5,6], -5≤0≤6, yes.\n\nBut τ=0 is now, current turn.\n\nSimilarly, second car on k=3: τ= -41, h= -30, so span at τ=0: [ -41, -30], moving right.\n\nSpan at τ: [ -41 +6τ, -30 +6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -41+6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -30+6τ\n\nFirst: -41+6τ ≤ 0 => 6τ ≤ 41 => τ ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30+6τ => 6τ ≥ 30 => τ ≥ 5\n\nSo τ from 5 to 6.833, so τ=6,7? Integer τ.\n\nτ=5: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, span [-11,0], so 0 ≤0≤0, yes 0 included.\n\nτ=6: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=7: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, covered at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nThird car on k=3: τ=37, h=48, span at τ=0: [37,48], moving right.\n\nSpan at τ: [37+6τ, 48+6τ]\n\n0 in span if 37+6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48+6τ\n\nBut 37+6τ ≥37>0, so 0 ≤ ... always false? 37+6τ ≤0? 37+6τ ≥37>0, so never ≤0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly, min is 37>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 3, cars cover x=0:\n\n- First car: at τ=0\n\n- Second car: at τ=5 and τ=6\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall for freeway 3, x=0 covered at τ=0, τ=5, τ=6.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since same cars listed: (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nSo identical to k=3, covered at τ=0,5,6.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car: (6,-5,right,6) which is same as first car on k=3, span [-5,6] at τ=0, moving right.\n\nSo covered when -5 +6τ ≤0 ≤6+6τ, which as before, only τ=0 since τ≤5/6.\n\nτ=0: covered, τ=1: not, etc.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, only at τ=0 covered.\n\nFreeway 7: same, only at τ=0 covered.\n\nFreeway 8: same, only at τ=0 covered.\n\nNow, freeway 1 and 2 covered only at τ=2.\n\nSummarize for each freeway, times τ when x=0 covered:\n\n- k=1: τ=2\n\n- k=2: τ=2\n\n- k=3: τ=0,5,6\n\n- k=4: τ=0,5,6\n\n- k=5: τ=0\n\n- k=6: τ=0\n\n- k=7: τ=0\n\n- k=8: τ=0\n\nτ=0 is the current turn, t=12.\n\nPlayer is currently at y=2, which is freeway? y=2 is row 2, which has cars, but at τ=0, for row y=2, is x=0 covered? Freeway y=2 is k=2? k is freeway index, I think k corresponds to y.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, and y=k, I assume, since y=1 to 8.\n\nSo freeway k=1 is y=1, k=2 is y=2, etc., up to k=8 is y=8.\n\nPlayer at τ=0 (turn t=12) is on y=2.\n\nFor y=2 (k=2), at τ=0, is x=0 covered? From above, k=2 covered at τ=2, not at τ=0.\n\nk=2: covered only at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, for k=2, span is [48,83] for left car, which is [48,83], 0 not in, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nAt τ=0, which rows have x=0 covered?\n\nk=3: covered at τ=0\n\nk=4: covered at τ=0\n\nk=5: covered at τ=0\n\nk=6: covered at τ=0\n\nk=7: covered at τ=0\n\nk=8: covered at τ=0\n\nk=1: not at τ=0\n\nk=2: not at τ=0\n\nPlayer is on y=2 at τ=0, and y=2 not covered, so no collision now.\n\nBut if we stay or move, we need to avoid future collisions.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nMinimum turns: since we need to go up 7 units, from 2 to 9, each U move +1, S or D don't help, so minimum H is at least 7, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are when we are on a row y at a time τ when that y has x=0 covered.\n\nFor example, if we are on y=1 at τ=2, it would be collision, since k=1 covered at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAlso, for y=3 to 8, at τ=0,5,6 they are covered if we are on them.\n\nτ=0 is now, but we are at y=2, not covered, so ok.\n\nNow, let's list for each row y, the τ when it is dangerous to be on that row.\n\ny=1 (k=1): dangerous at τ=2\n\ny=2 (k=2): dangerous at τ=2\n\ny=3 (k=3): dangerous at τ=0,5,6\n\ny=4 (k=4): dangerous at τ=0,5,6\n\ny=5 (k=5): dangerous at τ=0\n\ny=6 (k=6): dangerous at τ=0\n\ny=7 (k=7): dangerous at τ=0\n\ny=8 (k=8): dangerous at τ=0\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say τ=H, with y_{t1+H} =9? Turn at end.\n\nThe sequence: from τ=0 to τ=H-1, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and position after actions.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + τ, for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nPosition y_{t1 + τ} is determined after the action at that turn.\n\nAction at turn T affects position at T+1.\n\nLet me set τ starting from 0.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t1=12), player is at y=2. No action yet? The state is given at turn t1, so position (0,y_{t1}) with y_{t1}=2.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t1} for turn t1, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nSimilarly, a_{t1+1} for turn t1+1, determines y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to some turn when y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions, and after H actions, we have moved to y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nStart: before any action, at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn t1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy, with Δy based on a_{t1}.\n\nThen similarly.\n\nThe position y_t is for the beginning of turn t, I think, but collision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at (0, y_T), and if y_T between 1 and 8, we check if x=0 covered on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen after that, we take action a_T, which moves to y_{T+1}.\n\nIn terms of τ, at time τ (turn t1+τ), position y_{τ}, where y_{τ} is the row at that turn.\n\nFor collision at time τ, on row y_{τ}.\n\nWe need for all τ, when y_{τ} in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, that it is not a dangerous time for that row.\n\nDangerous times per row:\n\nRow y: dangerous τ\n\ny1: {2}\n\ny2: {2}\n\ny3: {0,5,6}\n\ny4: {0,5,6}\n\ny5: {0}\n\ny6: {0}\n\ny7: {0}\n\ny8: {0}\n\ny0 and y9: no danger, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0, y=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=0: not dangerous, since y2 dangerous only at τ=2.\n\nNow, we need to get to y=9.\n\nEach move, we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, we need net +7, so minimum 7 up moves, but we can have S or D which add turns.\n\nH is the number of turns, so minimal H is 7 if we can go directly up without collision.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row at dangerous τ.\n\nNow, let's see the dangerous times: at τ=2, y1 and y2 are dangerous.\n\nAlso, at τ=0, y3 to y8 are dangerous, but τ=0 is now, and we are on y=2, not on those.\n\nτ=0 is current, and we are about to take action.\n\nNow, future dangerous τ: τ=2 for y1 and y2, and τ=5,6 for y3 and y4.\n\ny5 to y8 only dangerous at τ=0, which is past after this turn.\n\nτ=0 is now, so for future turns τ≥1, y5 to y8 are never dangerous, since only at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, y3 and y4 dangerous at τ=5,6, but not at other times.\n\ny1 and y2 dangerous only at τ=2.\n\ny0 and y9 always safe.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2, τ=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some τ.\n\nMinimal path: go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up directly.\n\nSuppose we go U every turn.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=2, safe.\n\nAction a: U, so y_{τ=1} = 2 +1 =3? After action at τ=0, position at τ=1 is y=3.\n\nAt turn τ=0, we take action, which affects y at τ=1.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time τ (turn t1+τ), position is y_τ.\n\nThen we take action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nCollision is checked at each time τ based on y_τ and the cars at that time.\n\nFor τ from 0 to some end.\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0 = 2\n\nCheck collision: y_0=2, which is k=2, at τ=0, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nThen action a_0: U, D, or S.\n\nSuppose a_0 = U, then y_1 = 2 +1 =3\n\nNow at τ=1, y_1=3, which is k=3.\n\nIs y3 dangerous at τ=1? From above, y3 dangerous at τ=0,5,6. τ=1 not in, so safe? But we need to check if covered.\n\nFor y=3 at τ=1.\n\nFreeway k=3 at τ=1: from earlier, at τ=1, for k=3, cars:\n\nFirst car: span at τ=1: [-5+6(1), 6+6(1)] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: span [-41+6(1), -30+6(1)] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [37+6,48+6]=[43,54], 0 not in.\n\nSo no car covers x=0 at τ=1 for k=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up.\n\nContinue: a_0=U, y_1=3\n\nThen at τ=1, action a_1, suppose U, y_2=4\n\nAt τ=2, y_2=4, k=4.\n\nk=4 at τ=2: covered? k=4 dangerous at τ=0,5,6, not τ=2.\n\nCheck: at τ=2, k=4 cars:\n\nFirst car: [-5+12,6+12]=[7,18], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [-41+12, -30+12]=[-29,-18], 0 not in\n\nThird car: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], 0 not in\n\nSafe.\n\ny_2=4, safe.\n\nAction a_2, suppose U, y_3=5\n\nAt τ=3, y_3=5, k=5.\n\nk=5 dangerous only at τ=0, not τ=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_2=U, y_3=5\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=6\n\nAt τ=4, y_4=6, k=6, dangerous only τ=0, not τ=4, safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=7\n\nτ=5, y_5=7, k=7.\n\nk=7 dangerous only τ=0, not τ=5, so safe? But we need to check y3 and y4 at τ=5, but we are on y7.\n\ny_5=7 at τ=5.\n\nk=7 at τ=5: only one car, span at τ=5: [-5 +6*5, 6+6*5] = [-5+30,6+30]=[25,36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_5=U, y_6=8\n\nτ=6, y_6=8, k=8.\n\nk=8 at τ=6: car span [-5+36,6+36]=[31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=9\n\nNow at τ=7, y_7=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nAnd we reached y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? We took actions from τ=0 to τ=6, that's 7 actions? τ from 0 to 6, 7 turns? Let's count.\n\nStart: τ=0, position y_0=2\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1\n\nAfter a_1, y_2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_6, y_7=9\n\nSo we reach y_7=9 at turn τ=7.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_0 to a_6, that's 7 actions, H=7 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nHere, a_{t1} to a_{t1+6}, so H=7.\n\nNow, check if we had any collision.\n\nIn the path:\n\nτ=0: y=2, safe\n\nτ=1: y=3, safe\n\nτ=2: y=4, safe\n\nτ=3: y=5, safe\n\nτ=4: y=6, safe\n\nτ=5: y=7, safe\n\nτ=6: y=8, safe\n\nτ=7: y=9, safe\n\nBut τ=7 is when we reach y=9, but at τ=7, we are on y9, no action or collision check? At turn when y=9, we are done, I think.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is at τ=7.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions up to a_6, which sets y_7=9.\n\nNow, during the path, all positions were safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y3 and y4 dangerous at τ=5,6, but we were not on them at those times.\n\nAt τ=5, we were on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly τ=6 on y=8 safe.\n\nAnd τ=2, we were on y=4, not on y1 or y2.\n\ny1 and y2 dangerous at τ=2, but we were on y=4 at that time.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut we started from y=2, and went to y=3 at τ=1, etc.\n\nIn this path, we used all U, 7 moves to go up 7 steps.\n\nBut is there a problem at τ=0? We were on y=2, which was safe.\n\nBut for freeway y=3 at τ=0, it was dangerous, but we were not on it at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo seems we can reach in 7 turns with all U.\n\nBut the player is at (0,2) at τ=0, and we take action immediately.\n\nIn this case, with all U, we avoid all dangerous spots.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous τ for each row.\n\ny1: τ=2\n\ny2: τ=2\n\ny3: τ=0,5,6\n\ny4: τ=0,5,6\n\ny5: τ=0\n\ny6: τ=0\n\ny7: τ=0\n\ny8: τ=0\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt τ=0: y=2, not in danger list except for y3-8, but we are on y2, which is safe at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=1: y=3, but τ=1 not dangerous for y3 (danger at 0,5,6), so safe.\n\nAt τ=2: y=4, τ=2 not dangerous for y4 (danger at 0,5,6), safe.\n\nτ=3: y=5, danger only τ=0, not τ=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly all fine.\n\nWe could have gone slower, but 7 is minimum.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? For example, if we were forced to be on y1 or y2 at τ=2, but we are not.\n\ny=2 at τ=0, we move up immediately to y=3 at τ=1, so at τ=2 we are on y=4.\n\nIf we stayed at y=2, then at τ=2, y=2 would be dangerous.\n\nBut we didn't stay.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3 at τ=5,6, but we are past that.\n\nIn this path, at τ=5, we are on y=7, not y=3.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7 with all U actions.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nt1=12\n\nAction at turn 12: U, so y at turn 13: 3\n\nTurn 13: action U, y at turn 14:4\n\nTurn 14: action U, y at turn 15:5\n\nTurn 15: action U, y at turn 16:6\n\nTurn 16: action U, y at turn 17:7\n\nTurn 17: action U, y at turn 18:8\n\nTurn 18: action U, y at turn 19:9\n\nSo at turn 19, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nActions from turn 12 to turn 18, that's 7 actions: a12 to a18.\n\nH=7.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, which is 12 to 18.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+H-1\n\nHere H=7, so turns 12 to 18.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point we were on a dangerous spot.\n\nTurn 12: τ=0, y=2, freeway 2, cars: [48,83] left, at τ=0, span [48,83], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, so to y=3 at next turn.\n\nTurn 13: τ=1, y=3, freeway 3, at τ=1: as computed, spans [1,12], [-35,-24], [43,54], all not cover 0, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=4.\n\nTurn 14: τ=2, y=4, freeway 4, at τ=2: spans for k=4: first car [ -5+12=7, 6+12=18], second [ -41+12=-29, -30+12=-18], third [37+12=49,48+12=60? 48+12=60, yes], so [49,60], all not cover 0, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=5.\n\nTurn 15: τ=3, y=5, freeway 5, at τ=3: car span [-5 +6*3, 6+6*3]=[-5+18,6+18]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6.\n\nTurn 16: τ=4, y=6, freeway 6, at τ=4: car span [-5+24,6+24]=[19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7.\n\nTurn 17: τ=5, y=7, freeway 7, at τ=5: car span [-5+30,6+30]=[25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8.\n\nTurn 18: τ=6, y=8, freeway 8, at τ=6: car span [-5+36,6+36]=[31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9, safe, done.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we did at turn 19.\n\nWith 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer? 6 actions would require net +7 with only 6 moves, impossible since max +1 per move, so 7 is minimum.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeways 1 and 2, they have the same car, but we didn't encounter them.\n\nAlso, for y=3 and y=4, at τ=5 and τ=6 they are dangerous, but we were not on them.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3 would be dangerous, but we were on y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we stayed at y=2 for one turn.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, safe, action S, then y_1=2 still.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2, k=2 at τ=1: span for k=2 car: left, s=36, at τ=1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action U, y_2=3\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, k=3 at τ=2: spans: first car [ -5+12=7,6+12=18], second car [-41+12=-29,-30+12=-18], third [37+12=49,48+12=60], all not cover 0, safe.\n\nThen continue, but we wasted one turn, so H=8 or more, worse.\n\nIf we go up slower, same.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nt1=12\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 19.\n\nIn the sequence, up to turn 18 action.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the output, it should be boxed.\n\nBut let me see if at τ=0 for y=3 to 8, but we were not there.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, at τ=0, y=2 is safe, but if we had to go to y=3 at τ=0, but we can't, since we start at y=2.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Dangerous Times\nThe cars on each freeway move as specified, and collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway row \\(y\\) at a turn \\(T\\) where \\(x = 0\\) is covered by a car on that row. The dangerous times \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\) (where \\(\\tau\\) is the turn offset from \\(t_1\\)) for each freeway are:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\)\n- **Freeway 2 (\\(y = 2\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\)\n- **Freeway 3 (\\(y = 3\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0, 5, 6\\)\n- **Freeway 4 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0, 5, 6\\)\n- **Freeway 5 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n- **Freeway 6 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n- **Freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n- **Freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n\nRows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe (no cars).\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) Minimally\nThe player starts at \\(y = 2\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\). To reach \\(y = 9\\), a net change of +7 in the y-coordinate is required. Since each \"U\" action increases y by 1, and \"S\" or \"D\" actions do not contribute to upward progress, the minimum number of turns \\(H\\) is at least 7 (achievable with 7 consecutive \"U\" actions).\n\nA sequence of 7 \"U\" actions is feasible without collisions:\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 12), player is at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is not dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- After action \"U\" at turn 12, player moves to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 13). At \\(\\tau = 1\\), \\(y = 3\\) is safe (not dangerous at \\(\\tau = 1\\)).\n- Continue with \"U\" actions each turn, reaching \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) not dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\)), \\(y = 5\\) at \\(\\tau = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\)), \\(y = 6\\) at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (safe, similarly), \\(y = 7\\) at \\(\\tau = 5\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\)), \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 6\\) (safe, similarly), and finally \\(y = 9\\) at \\(\\tau = 7\\) (safe, no cars).\n\nThis path avoids all dangerous times:\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\), when \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are dangerous, the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (safe).\n- At \\(\\tau = 5\\) and \\(\\tau = 6\\), when \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are dangerous, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) (safe).\n\nNo shorter path exists, as 6 turns can achieve at most a net +6 in y-coordinate (e.g., from 2 to 8), not reaching 9. Thus, \\(H = 7\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\) to \\(18\\) is all \"U\":\n\n- Turn 12: U\n- Turn 13: U\n- Turn 14: U\n- Turn 15: U\n- Turn 16: U\n- Turn 17: U\n- Turn 18: U\n\nAfter the action at turn 18, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19, avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=13, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements because I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn. The collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway k, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position updates based on actions: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nThe car spans move based on their speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, left-moving, head=12, tail=47, speed=36. Since it's left-moving, head should be the left end? No, let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\". For left-moving, span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 1: head=12, tail=47. If it's left-moving, and span [12,47], that would mean from 12 to 47, which is rightward if increasing x, but since it's moving left, positions are decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\", so for right-moving, they define span as [τ, h] with τ < h I assume, so it moves right.\n\nIn freeway 1: head=12, tail=47, direction left. But [h,τ] = [12,47], so if left-moving, at t1=13, span is [12,47].\n\nThen at time T, span is [12 - 36*(T-13), 47 - 36*(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2 is same as freeway 1: (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h], so for (12,1,right,6), is τ=12 or h=12? It says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h].\n\nIn the state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be the front, so for moving right, head is larger than tail.\n\nIn (12,1,right,6), if head=12, tail=1, and direction right, span should be [τ,h] = [1,12], I think.\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35,right,6): head=-24? That might be a typo or something, but let's see.\n\nhead=-24, tail=-35, direction right. Since right-moving, span should be [τ,h] = [-35,-24]? Because τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation: \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h].\n\nSo for (12,1,right,6): head=12, tail=1, so span at t1 is [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35,right,6): head=-24, tail=-35, so span [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\n(54,43,right,6): head=54, tail=43, span [43,54]\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: only (12,1,right,6) so span [1,12]\n\nFreeway 6: same, (12,1,right,6) span [1,12]\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 have left-moving cars with large spans and high speed.\n\nI need to get from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so position y=3 is on freeway 3.\n\nBut at the start, turn t1=13, I'm at (0,3), so on freeway 3 at turn 13.\n\nNow, I need to check if I collide with any car on freeway 3 at turn 13.\n\nFor freeway 3, cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nAt turn T=13, spans:\n\nFirst car: [τ,h] = [1,12] for right-moving, so positions from 1 to 12 inclusive? I assume span includes integers between min and max.\n\nThe collision is if 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 3 at T=13:\n\nCar 1: span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nCar 2: span [-35,-24], 0 not in there\n\nCar 3: span [43,54], 0 not in there\n\nSo at turn 13, on freeway 3, no car has 0 in span, so I'm safe at start.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since I start at y=3, need to go to y=9, that's 6 steps up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut I should minimize H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nEach turn I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, min steps is 6 if I always go up.\n\nBut I might be blocked.\n\nNow, let's consider the cars on each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 and 2: both have a left-moving car with head=12, tail=47, speed=36 at t1=13.\n\nSince it's left-moving, span at T is [12 - 36*(T-13), 47 - 36*(T-13)]\n\nThis car is very long, from 12 to 47, so 36 units long? Tail to head distance is |47-12|=35, but since left-moving, head at 12, tail at 47, so if positions increase to the right, tail is at 47, head at 12, so it's moving left, so head is left end.\n\nSpan [12,47] at T=13.\n\nAt time T, [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT] where ΔT = T - 13.\n\nCollision on freeway 1 if 0 in [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT] for some T when I'm on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2.\n\nNow, 0 in [L,R] means L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSo for freeway 1: 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut since the car is long, 35 units, and speed 36, it moves fast.\n\nLet me find when this car covers position 0.\n\nSet 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 12 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, so T >= 13 + 1/3, so since T integer, T >= 14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T <= 13 + 1.305 = 14.305, so T <= 14 since T integer.\n\nT=14: ΔT=1\n\nL = 12 - 36*1 = 12-36= -24\n\nR = 47 - 36*1 = 11\n\nSo span at T=14: [-24,11]\n\n0 is between -24 and 11, yes, 0 in [-24,11]\n\nSimilarly, at T=15: ΔT=2, L=12-72= -60, R=47-72= -25, span [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=13: [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at T=14 only, when 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same car, same thing, collision only at T=14.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars at T=13:\n\nCar1: (12,1,right,6) span [1,12] at T=13\n\nAs right-moving, span [τ,h] = [1,12] since head=12, tail=1.\n\nAt time T, span [1 + 6*(T-13), 12 + 6*(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly, car2: (-24,-35,right,6) head=-24, tail=-35, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24] at T=13\n\nAt T: [-35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT]\n\nCar3: (54,43,right,6) head=54, tail=43, span [43,54] at T=13\n\nAt T: [43 + 6ΔT, 54 + 6ΔT]\n\nNow, collision on freeway 3 if 0 in any span at T.\n\nFor car1: 0 in [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT] for some ΔT\n\n1 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 12 + 6ΔT? But 1 + 6ΔT >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= 1 + 6ΔT is true since 1+6ΔT >=1, but 0 <= something positive always true, but need 0 >= left and 0 <= right.\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L <= 0 and 0 <= R.\n\nFor car1: L = 1 + 6ΔT >=1 >0, so L >0, so 0 < L <= R, so 0 not <= L? L <= 0 is false since L>=1, so 0 not in span for car1 at any T, because the span is always to the right of 0, starting from 1 at T=13 and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, car3: L=43 + 6ΔT >=43 >0, so always right of 0, 0 not in span.\n\nCar2: span [-35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, T <= 18.833, T<=18\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4, T>=17\n\nSo T from 17 to 18 inclusive.\n\nΔT >=4 and ΔT <=5.833, so ΔT=4,5\n\nT=13+4=17, T=13+5=18\n\nAt T=17: span [-35 + 24, -24 + 24] = [-11, 0]? ΔT=4, L= -35 + 6*4 = -35+24= -11, R= -24+24=0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included? Since it's a span, I think integers, so positions from -11 to 0 inclusive, so 0 is in.\n\nSimilarly T=18: L= -35 + 30 = -5, R= -24 + 30 = 6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=19: L= -35+36=1, R= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, car2 causes collision at T=17 and T=18.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so also collision at T=17,18.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car, (12,1,right,6) same as above, span [1,12] at T=13, moving right, so L=1+6ΔT >=1>0, so never covers 0. So no collision on freeway 5 at any time.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8: all have (12,1,right,6) only, so no collision ever, since span always positive and increasing.\n\nFreeway 5: only (12,1,right,6), so span [1 +6ΔT, 12+6ΔT], min position 1 at T=13, increases, so 0 never in span.\n\nSame for 6,7,8.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 have additional cars that cause collision at T=17,18.\n\nNow, freeway 1 and 2 have collision at T=14 only.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=3 to y=9, I need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I can stay or move vertically.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns are when I might be on a freeway that has a car at 0.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- On y=1 or y=2 at T=14: collision\n\n- On y=3 or y=4 at T=17 or T=18: collision\n\ny=3 at T=17,18; y=4 at T=17,18.\n\nOther freeways are safe except those times.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 no collision ever.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nI start at y=3 at T=13.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to go up fast.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=1 or y=2 at T=14.\n\nAnd avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at T=17 or T=18.\n\nNow, T=14 is soon, since current is T=13.\n\nAt T=13, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, I can take action at T=13 to move to next position at T=14.\n\nThe action at turn t affects position at t+1.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T and 0 in span for that freeway at T.\n\nAlso, note: when I move from y to y+1 or y-1 at turn T, at turn T I am still on y, and at T+1 I am on y+1.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only on y_T at T.\n\nSo for collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, regardless of where I'm going.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T), and that's where collision is checked.\n\nNow, sequence: at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the position at time t is y_t.\n\nFor example, at t=13, I am at y_13=3.\n\nI choose a_13, which sets y_14.\n\nThen at t=14, I am at y_14, and I choose a_14, sets y_15, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway k=y_t, and 0 in span of some car on k at time t.\n\nNow, for t=14, if I am on y=1 or y=2, collision because freeway 1 and 2 have car at 0 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, at t=17 and t=18, if on y=3 or y=4, collision.\n\nNow, other times and positions are safe.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nI start at t=13, y=3.\n\nt=13 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T_end, with y_{T_end} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1 to T_end, so turns t1 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nSince I start at t1=13, after H turns, I am at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nI start at turn t1=13, y_13=3.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=13 to t=13+H-1, I set actions, and y_{13+H} is the position after H steps.\n\nThen I need y_{13+H} =9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is turn T=13+H.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at T=13, y=3.\n\nAfter first action, at T=14, y= y13 + Δy based on a13.\n\nI need to find min H such that I can have y_{13+H} =9.\n\nAnd the actions from a13 to a_{13+H-1}.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, min H is at least 6, from 3 to 9.\n\nBut I might need more if I have to avoid.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous turns.\n\nDangerous:\n\n- t=14: if on y=1 or y=2\n\n- t=17: if on y=3 or y=4\n\n- t=18: if on y=3 or y=4\n\nt=17 and t=18 both dangerous for y=3 and y=4.\n\nNow, other times are safe for all y.\n\nBut I need to plan the path.\n\nSince I want min H, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on bad positions at bad times.\n\nStart at t=13, y=3.\n\nt=13: safe.\n\nNow, at t=13, I choose action.\n\nIf I go up, a13=U, then y14=4.\n\nBut at t=14, if y14=4, is it dangerous? t=14 danger only for y=1 and 2, not for y=4. y=4 is dangerous only at t=17 and 18.\n\nAt t=14, y=4 is safe, since only y=1,2 are bad at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, y14=3, safe at t=14.\n\nIf I go down, y14=2, but at t=14, y=2 is dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I should not go down to y=2 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, not to y=1.\n\nSo at t=13, possible actions:\n\n- U: y14=4\n\n- S: y14=3\n\n- D: y14=2, but at t=14, y=2 collision, so invalid, must avoid.\n\nSo a13 cannot be D, because it would cause collision at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, a13=S: y14=3, safe at t=14.\n\na13=U: y14=4, safe at t=14.\n\nNow, from there.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, need to avoid t=17 and t=18 on y=3 or y=4.\n\nt=17 and t=18 are in the future.\n\nCurrent t=13, t=14 is next.\n\nt=17 is 4 turns later, t=18 is 5 turns later.\n\nSince min steps up is 6, from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=3 to y=9, difference 6, so min 6 actions to increase by 6.\n\nBut with possible waiting, H could be more.\n\nNow, let's think about the critical times.\n\nI need to not be on y=3 or y=4 at t=17 or t=18.\n\nt=17 and t=18 are specific turns.\n\nSince the dangerous periods are short, I might time my movement to be elsewhere at those times.\n\nFor example, at t=17 and t=18, I should be on y<=2 or y>=5 or y=0 or 9.\n\nBut y=0 is below, y=9 above.\n\nNow, y=5,6,7,8 are always safe.\n\ny=1 and 2 are only dangerous at t=14, but at other times safe.\n\ny=3 and 4 dangerous at t=17,18, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, let's list possible y at each turn from t=13 onwards.\n\nt=13: y=3 (fixed)\n\nt=14: y can be 2,3,4 but y=2 invalid at t=14, so y=3 or 4.\n\nFrom t=13, y14 can be:\n\nIf a13=S, y14=3\n\nIf a13=U, y14=4\n\na13=D, y14=2, but collision, so not possible.\n\nSo y14 =3 or 4.\n\nNow t=15: from y14, I choose a14, so y15 can be y14-1, y14, y14+1, but bounded 0-9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I need to avoid y=3 or 4 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nt=17 is turn 17, t=18 turn 18.\n\nNow, from t=13 to t=17 is 4 turns, so y at t=17 depends on actions from t=13 to t=16.\n\nSimilarly, y at t=18 depends on actions to t=17.\n\nSince I start at t=13, after k actions, position at t=13+k.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T.\n\nT=17, y_17\n\nT=18, y_18\n\nI need y_17 not 3 or 4, and y_18 not 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, I need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible except when I need to avoid.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nCurrent t=13, y=3.\n\nSuppose I go up immediately.\n\nOption 1: always up when possible.\n\nStart: t=13, y=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\nt=14, y=4, safe (since t=14 only y=1,2 bad)\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\nt=15, y=5, freeway 5, safe always\n\na15=U, y16=6\n\nt=16, y=6, safe\n\na16=U, y17=7\n\nt=17, y=7, freeway 7, safe (y=7 always safe)\n\na17=U, y18=8\n\nt=18, y=8, safe\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nt=19, y=9, reached.\n\nSo H=6 actions: from a13 to a18, and at t=19, y=9.\n\nt=13+H =19, so 13+H=19, H=6.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nt=13: y=3, safe\n\nt=14: y=4, on freeway 4. At t=14, freeway 4: cars same as freeway 3? Freeway 4 has cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nAt t=14, ΔT = t - t1 = 14-13=1\n\nSpans:\n\nCar1: [1 +6*1, 12+6*1] = [7,18], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [-35 +6*1, -24 +6*1] = [-29,-18], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [43+6,54+6]=[49,60], 0 not in\n\nSo no collision at t=14 on y=4.\n\nt=15: y=5, freeway 5, only car (12,1,right,6) at t=15, ΔT=2, span [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], no 0.\n\nt=16: y=6, similar, safe\n\nt=17: y=7, freeway 7, (12,1,right,6) span at t=17, ΔT=4, [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], no 0.\n\nt=18: y=8, similar, safe.\n\nt=19: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAnd I reached at t=19.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=6, from a13 to a18, 6 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nStart: turn t=13, y=3\n\nAfter a13 (at t=13), y14=4\n\nAfter a14 (t=14), y15=5\n\n...\n\nAfter a18 (t=18), y19=9\n\nSo position at turn t=19 is y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 6, from t=13 to t=18 inclusive.\n\nThe sequence is from t=13 to t=13+H-1, with y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=13, t1+H=19, so H=6.\n\nIn the path above, I was never on y=3 or y=4 at t=17 or t=18; at t=17 I was on y=7, t=18 on y=8.\n\nAnd not on y=1 or 2 at t=14.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps, so H=6 is minimum possible.\n\nBut in this case, it seems to work without any issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought about t=17 and t=18 dangerous for y=3,4, but in this path I left y=4 at t=14, and by t=15 I was at y=5, so no problem.\n\nAt t=14 I was at y=4, which is safe at t=14.\n\nt=17 is later.\n\nIn this path, at t=17 I was at y=7, fine.\n\nBut let me check if for freeway 4 at other times, but no, only t=17,18 dangerous, but I wasn't there.\n\nIn the path, I was on y=4 at t=14, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=13, safe.\n\nSo it seems I can reach in 6 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn this case, all actions U.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 3 and 4 at t=17,18.\n\nFor example, at t=17, freeway 3: car2 span [-35 +6*4, -24+6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 in span, so if I were on y=3 at t=17, collision.\n\nBut in my path, at t=17, I was on y=7, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly, t=18, freeway 3: car2 span [-35+30, -24+30]= [-5,6], 0 in, but I on y=8.\n\nFreeway 4 same.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6, with all U actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=13 to t=18, all U.\n\nt=13 to t=13+H-1 = t=13 to t=18 for H=6.\n\ny_{t1+H} = y_{19} =9.\n\nNow, but in the answer format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t1=13.\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 19, position y=9.\n\nBut is turn 19 included? No, the actions are up to turn 18.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t=18, leading to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 19.\n\nNow, but let me see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I start at y=3, t=13.\n\nIf I could be at y=9 earlier, but from t=13, after 5 actions, y_{18} could be at most y=3+5=8, if all up, so at t=18, y=8, then need one more to y=9 at t=19.\n\nMinimal is t=19 for y=9.\n\nIf I go down first, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nAnd this path works.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1 and 2, at t=14, collision, but I was not on them.\n\nAnother thing: at t=13, I am on y=3.\n\nIn the action, if I stay at t=13, y14=3, then I can still go up later.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=13, a13=S, y14=3\n\nThen a14=U, y15=4\n\nThen a15=U, y16=5\n\netc., to y19=8 or something, later.\n\nFor instance, to reach y=9 at t=19, same as before, but if I stay once, I reach later.\n\nt=13: y=3, a13=S, y14=3\n\nt=14: y=3, safe? t=14, on y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt t=14, freeway 3: ΔT=1\n\nCar1: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18], no 0\n\nCar2: [-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18], no 0\n\nCar3: [43+6,54+6]=[49,60], no 0\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a14=U, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, freeway 4, ΔT=2\n\nSpans: car1: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24]\n\nCar2: [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12]\n\nCar3: [43+12,54+12]=[55,66]\n\nAll no 0, safe.\n\na15=U, y16=5\n\nAnd so on, but to reach y=9, I need more actions.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at t=14, go up to y=4 at t=15, y=5 at t=16, y=6 at t=17, y=7 at t=18, y=8 at t=19, then need to go to y=9 at t=20, so H=7, worse.\n\nSo staying is not better.\n\nGoing down is worse.\n\nSo all up is best.\n\nBut in the all up path, I was on y=4 at t=14, which is freeway 4, but safe at that time.\n\nIs there any other constraint?\n\nThe cars on freeway 5,6,7,8 are always safe, as we saw.\n\nBut in freeway 5,6,7,8, only one car each, (12,1,right,6), which never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6 with all U actions.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, which is 13 to 18.\n\nAnd y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn 19.\n\nPerhaps I need to confirm if at turn 18, position is (0,8), and after action U, to (0,9).\n\nBut the reaching is at turn 19.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier, but impossible from y=3 in less than 6 steps.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at y=3.\n\nAnother thing: y=9 is not freeway, so when I am at y=9, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 18, I am at y=8, and I take U to go to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut at turn 18, I am on freeway 8, which is safe.\n\nNo car covers 0 at any time on freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 3 and 4, I have multiple cars, but in the path, I only care when I am on that freeway.\n\nIn my path, I was on freeway 3 at t=13, safe.\n\nOn freeway 4 at t=14, safe.\n\nThen freeway 5 at t=15, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid something else, but I think not.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let me see the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,3), turn 13.\n\nCars as given.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFor (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24], at t1=13.\n\nAt T, [ -35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT ]\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=4, [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nSimilarly at T=18, [-35+30, -24+30]=[-5,6], 0 included.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on freeway 3 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 only dangerous at t=14.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be six U actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be listed.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nSince it's a sequence from t=0 to H-1 relative, but here absolute turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t1=13.\n\nH=6, so turns 13 to 18.\n\nPerhaps I need to include only up to the action before reaching, but yes.\n\nAnother thing: the note about when moving, not considered on the new row until next turn, which I think I handled.\n\nIn this case, when I move from y to y+1 at turn t, at turn t I am on y, not on y+1.\n\nBut in collision, at turn t, on y_t, which is correct.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) is 6. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (\"U\") at every turn from \\(t = 13\\) to \\(t = 18\\), resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 19\\).\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 13**: Player at \\((0, 3)\\). Action \\(a_{13} = U\\), so \\(y_{14} = 4\\).\n  - Collision check at turn 13 on freeway 3: No car has 0 in its span (spans are [1,12], [-35,-24], [43,54] at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\)), so safe.\n- **Turn 14**: Player at \\((0, 4)\\).

Action \\(a_{18} = U\\), so \\(y_{19} = 9\\).\n  - Collision check at turn 18 on freeway 8: Span at \\(\\Delta T = 5\\) is [31,42]; 0 not in span, so safe.  \n  (Note: Freeways 3 and 4 are dangerous at turn 18, but player is on freeway 8, which is safe.)\n- **Turn 19**: Player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nThis path avoids all collisions:\n- Not on freeways 1 or 2 at turn 14 (dangerous turn for these freeways).\n- Not on freeways 3 or 4 at turns 17 or 18 (dangerous turns for these freeways).\n- Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 are always safe, as no car covers position 0 at any turn.\n\nThe sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) in the minimum \\(H = 6\\) turns, as the player must increase \\(y\\) by 6 units, requiring at least 6 up actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 14, and I have the positions and movements of the cars.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left with speed s, so for each turn after t₁, the head and tail decrease by s per turn. For right-moving, they increase by s per turn.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nMy position is vertical only; x is always 0, I think, since it's a grid but only y changes, and I'm at x=0.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, y changes.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8, and I need to go from y=4 to y=9. y=9 is the goal, which might be above the freeways, so no cars there, I assume.\n\ny=0 to y=9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, but I start at y=4, need to reach y=9.\n\nCollision only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9), which might be the end position.\n\nNow, actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=0, I can't go down, similarly at y=9, can't go up, but since I'm going to y=9, I need to stop there.\n\nThe sequence should end when I reach y=9, I think.\n\nThe position is updated before checking collision? Let me see the order.\n\nFrom player update: at turn t, I choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and if y_{t+1} is between 1 and 8, I might collide if 0 is in car span at turn t+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T when I am on freeway y_T, meaning at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut when I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I need to check for collision at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly, when I leave a freeway, I don't care after I leave.\n\nNow, for the cars, their position is given at t₁=14, and for future turns, we compute based on that.\n\nLet me list all the cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -24, tail 11, left, speed 36.\n\nDirection left, so moving left.\n\nAt turn t, span is [h - s(t - t₁), τ - s(t - t₁)] for left-moving.\n\nt₁=14.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: k=1, car: h=-24, τ=11, d=left, s=36.\n\nSince left-moving, at time T, span = [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)] = [-24 - 36(T-14), 11 - 36(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-24,11,left,36) same car? Or different? It says \"Cars\" but for k=1 and k=2, it's listed separately, so I think each freeway has its own cars.\n\nFor k=1: only one car: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nk=2: similarly, (-24,11,left,36) but probably a different car at same position? Or same? Doesn't matter, we treat per freeway.\n\nk=3: three cars: (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nk=4: same as k=3: (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nk=5: one car: (18,7,right,6)\n\nk=6: (18,7,right,6)\n\nk=7: (18,7,right,6)\n\nk=8: (18,7,right,6)\n\nSo freeways 1 and 2 have left-moving cars with high speed, freeways 3-8 have right-moving cars with slower speed.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9. So I need to move up, since 9>4.\n\nMinimal turns would be to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid collisions.\n\ny=4 to y=9, difference 5, so at least 5 turns if I go up each turn, but I might need to wait or something if there are collisions.\n\nBut I start at y=4, which is a freeway? y=4 is freeway k=4, I think freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 for k=1 to 8.\n\nk is the freeway number, so freeway 1 at y=1, freeway 2 at y=2, etc.\n\nSo at turn t₁=14, I am at y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nNow, at this turn, I need to check if I collide? The collision is checked when I am on the freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn t₁=14, I am at y=4, so I need to see if for freeway 4, at T=14, 0 is in any car span.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6) at t=14.\n\nSince right-moving, at T, span = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]? Earlier I defined for left: [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], but for right, it should be [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ] since head is forward.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the problem: for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the initial state, for right-moving, it's given as (head h, tail τ), but in the span, it's [τ, h] meaning from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left, span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ]\n\nIn the car state, for k=3, it says (18,7,right,6), so I think head=18, tail=7, and since right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [7,18]? But in the notation, it's written as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head is larger if moving right.\n\nAssume that for right-moving, head > tail, and for left-moving, head < tail? In the example, for left-moving on k=1, head=-24, tail=11, so head < tail since moving left, so span is [head, tail] with head left of tail? I think I need to clarify.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → moves left, so at T, [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ]\n\nSince it moves left, the head decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ], so tail increases to the right, head increases.\n\nIn the state, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, left, s) with h and τ, and for left, h is left end, τ is right end? In k=1, h=-24, τ=11, and left-moving, so at t₁, span [h, τ] = [-24,11], and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, for example k=3 car1: head=18, tail=7, direction right, so span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [7,18], and moves right, so both increase.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it's (head, tail) but in span it's [tail, head] for the interval? I think it's consistent if we define head as the front when moving.\n\nBut for collision, we care if 0 is in the span.\n\nFor freeway 4 at t=14:\n\nCars:\n\n1. (head=18, tail=7, right, s=6) → span at T=14: [τ, h] = [7,18]? From the update, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn the problem: for right-moving, \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" so at t₁, span is from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly, for left, Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\n\nSo for freeway 4 at t=14:\n\nCar1: (18,7,right,6) so τ=7, h=18, span = [7,18]\n\nCar2: (-18,-29,right,6) head=-18, tail=-29? tail=-29, head=-18, since right-moving, span = [τ, h] = [-29,-18]\n\nCar3: (60,49,right,6) head=60, tail=49, span = [49,60]\n\nNow, is 0 in any of these? [7,18] no, [-29,-18] no, [49,60] no. So at t=14, on freeway 4, 0 not in any span, so no collision at start.\n\nBut I need to move to y=9.\n\nNow, since I need to go up, and y=9 is above, I should go up when possible.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn and each freeway I might be on.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to see when 0 is occupied on each freeway.\n\nLet me find for each freeway and each turn, whether 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFirst, define Δt = T - t₁ = T - 14.\n\nFor a given freeway, at turn T, if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, s=36, h=-24, τ=11 at t₁=14.\n\nAt T, span = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] = [-24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36Δt\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car parameters, so same occupancy at 0.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 both have identical cars? k=1 and k=2 both have (-24,11,left,36), so yes, same.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving, s=6.\n\nCar1: head=18, tail=7, so at t₁, span [τ=7, h=18] = [7,18]\n\nAt T, [7 +6Δt, 18 +6Δt]\n\n0 in this? 7+6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 18+6Δt? Since 7+6Δt >0 for Δt≥0, so never, because min is 7 at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, car2: head=-18, tail=-29, at t₁ span [τ=-29, h=-18] = [-29,-18]\n\nAt T, [-29 +6Δt, -18 +6Δt]\n\n0 in this? -29+6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -18+6Δt\n\nSolve: left: -29+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤29 => Δt ≤ 29/6 ≈4.833, so Δt ≤4 since turn integer? T integer, t₁=14, T integer, so Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T -14, integer.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 ≤ -18+6Δt => 6Δt ≥18 => Δt ≥3\n\nSo for Δt from 3 to 4 inclusive? Let's see:\n\n-29+6Δt ≤0 and 0 ≤ -18+6Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -29+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤29 => Δt ≤ 29/6 = 4 + 5/6, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -18+6Δt => 6Δt ≥18 => Δt ≥3\n\nSo for Δt=3 and 4, 0 is in [-29+6Δt, -18+6Δt]\n\nFor Δt=3: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nFor Δt=4: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], 0 in, yes.\n\nFor Δt=5: [-29+30, -18+30] = [1,12], 0 not <=1? 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nΔt=2: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, since -6<0.\n\nSo for car2 on freeway 3, 0 occupied at Δt=3 and 4, i.e., T=17 and 18.\n\nT=14+3=17, T=14+4=18.\n\nNow car3: (60,49,right,6) span at T: [49+6Δt, 60+6Δt], min 49>0, so never 0.\n\nSo for freeway 3, occupied at 0 when? Car1 never, car2 at T=17 and 18, car3 never. So only at T=17 and 18, 0 is occupied on freeway 3.\n\nBut freeway 3 has multiple cars, so if any car has 0 in span, it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since identical cars: (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nSo same, occupied at T=17 and 18.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car: (18,7,right,6) so head=18, tail=7, right-moving, span at T: [7+6Δt, 18+6Δt], always >0, so never occupied at 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, (18,7,right,6), never occupied.\n\nFreeway 7: same, never.\n\nFreeway 8: same, never.\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2: left-moving, s=36.\n\nAt T, span: [-24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt]\n\n0 in span if -24-36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 11-36Δt\n\nLeft inequality: -24-36Δt ≤0 always true for Δt≥0? -24-36Δt ≤0 => -36Δt ≤24, multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36Δt ≥ -24, always true since Δt≥0.\n\nRight inequality: 0 ≤ 11-36Δt => 11-36Δt ≥0 => 36Δt ≤11 => Δt ≤ 11/36 ≈0.305, so only possible for Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=14, 0 ≤11? 11>0, yes. But 0 in [-24,11]? -24≤0≤11, yes, 0 is in.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=14, for freeway 1 and 2, at T=14, 0 is in the span? Let's see.\n\nAt T=14, Δt=0, span [-24,11], so yes, 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nBut at turn t₁=14, I am on freeway 4, y=4, not on freeway 1 or 2, so no collision for me. But for the freeway itself, at T=14, freeway 1 and 2 have 0 occupied.\n\nBut since I'm not there, it doesn't affect me.\n\nFor freeway 1 and 2, occupied at 0 only at T=14? At Δt=0.\n\nFor Δt=1, T=15: span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt>0, span more negative, so only at T=14, 0 occupied for freeway 1 and 2.\n\nBut T=14 is now, and I'm not on them.\n\nNow, for other freeways:\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 occupied at T=17 and 18.\n\nFreeway 5-8 never occupied.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have only one car like (18,7,right,6), which span [7+6Δt,18+6Δt] >=7>0, so indeed never 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo summary of occupied times:\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied at T=14 only\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at T=14 only\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied at T=17,18\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied at T=17,18\n\n- Freeway 5: never\n\n- Freeway 6: never\n\n- Freeway 7: never\n\n- Freeway 8: never\n\nI am at y=4 at T=14, which is freeway 4.\n\nAt T=14, freeway 4 is not occupied, as we saw earlier.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is above freeway 8, I think, no freeway at y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars.\n\nNow, I can move up or down or stay.\n\nSince I need to go up, and freeways above might be occupied at some times.\n\nBut freeway 5-8 are never occupied, so if I can reach them, I can go up freely.\n\nBut freeway 4 is occupied at T=17 and 18, so I need to not be on freeway 4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 occupied at same times.\n\nBut I start at freeway 4 at T=14.\n\nNow, minimal turns: from y=4 to y=9, need +5 in y, so at least 5 up moves, but I can stay or move down, which might take more turns.\n\nSince freeway 5-8 are safe, I should go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid being on freeway 4 at T=17 or 18.\n\nT=17 and 18 are future turns.\n\nCurrent turn T=14, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to plan actions from T=14 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t= t₁ + t, but in terms of T.\n\nSet T relative to t₁.\n\nLet τ = T - t₁, so τ=0 is now.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some H, so after H turns, I am at y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nThe position: at turn t₁, I am at y=4.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, I move to y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of actions for t from t₁ to t₁ + H-1, and after H actions, I am at y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nAnd y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nMin H.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, from 4 to 9, min H=5 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might not be able to if collision.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, when I am on y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and if freeway y_T has 0 occupied at T, then collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, I am not on the new freeway until the next turn.\n\nNow, let's list for each τ, what y I am at, and whether collision if I am on a freeway.\n\nBut I need to choose actions.\n\nSince freeway 5-8 are always safe, if I can get to y=5 quickly, I can go up.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is safe.\n\nAt τ=0, T=14, y=4.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=5 at τ=1, T=15.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 at τ=1, T=15.\n\nIf down, to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nBut y=3 is freeway 3, which is occupied at T=17,18, but not now.\n\nNow, freeway 4 is occupied at T=17 and 18, which is τ=3 and 4, since τ= T-14, so T=17 is τ=3, T=18 is τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 occupied at τ=3 and 4.\n\nI need to not be on freeway 3 or 4 at τ=3 and 4.\n\nτ=3 is T=17, τ=4 is T=18.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=4.\n\nI want to leave freeway 4 as soon as possible, but I need to go to safe freeways.\n\nOption: go up to y=5 immediately.\n\nAt τ=0, T=14, I choose a_{t₁} = U, so move up.\n\nThen at τ=1, T=15, I am at y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is never occupied, so at T=15, on freeway 5, 0 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen I can keep going up.\n\nFrom y=5, I can go to y=6 at T=16, etc.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nFrom τ=1, T=15, y=5, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=6 at τ=2, T=16.\n\ny=6 freeway 6, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=3, T=17.\n\ny=7 freeway 7, safe, never occupied.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=4, T=18.\n\ny=8 freeway 8, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=5, T=19.\n\ny=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nNow, check collisions: at T=15, y=5, freeway 5, no car at 0, safe.\n\nT=16, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nT=17, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nT=18, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nT=19, y=9, no issue.\n\nBut at T=17 and 18, freeway 3 and 4 are occupied, but I am on y=7 and y=8, not on them, so fine.\n\nNow, what about at start: at T=14, I am on y=4, which is freeway 4, and at T=14, we saw no collision, since 0 not in any span for freeway 4 at T=14.\n\nIn the sequence, I moved at T=14 to go to y=5 at T=15.\n\nSo I was on y=4 at T=14, no collision.\n\nThen actions: from T=14 to T=18, I go up each time, reaching y=9 at T=19.\n\nT=19 is turn t₁ + 5, since τ=5.\n\nt₁=14, T=19, so H=5 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at turn t₁=14, position y=4.\n\nAfter action a_{14}, I go to y_{15}.\n\nAfter action a_{15}, y_{16}, and so on, up to a_{14 + H-1}, and y_{14 + H} =9.\n\nSo number of actions: H actions, from t=14 to t=14+H-1, and y at t=14+H is 9.\n\nIn this case, with all U:\n\nt=14: action U, then y_{15} = y_{14} +1 =5\n\nt=15: action U, y_{16}=6\n\nt=16: action U, y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: action U, y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: action U, y_{19}=9\n\nSo at turn T=19, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, check for collision during:\n\nAt each turn T, when I am on y_T.\n\nAt T=14, I am on y=4, freeway 4, and as computed, no collision at T=14.\n\nAt T=15, y=5, freeway 5, no collision ever.\n\nT=16, y=6, freeway 6, no collision.\n\nT=17, y=7, freeway 7, no collision.\n\nT=18, y=8, freeway 8, no collision.\n\nT=19, y=9, no freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd I reached in 5 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal? Since I need to increase by 5, 5 is minimal, so yes.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 4 occupied at T=17,18, but in this path, I am not on it at those times.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=17, I am on y=7, not on 4.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 4 occupation.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at T=17 and 18.\n\nT=17 is τ=3, T=18 τ=4.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=17, I am at y=7, not 4.\n\nSimilarly T=18, y=8.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps I could reach faster? But from 4 to 9, min 5 moves up, so 5 is minimum.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9, difference 5, so at least 5 up actions, and no down or stay, so H=5 is minimum.\n\nIn this case, it seems possible without any issue.\n\nBut is there a problem at the beginning?\n\nAt T=14, on freeway 4, no collision.\n\nThen I move up immediately.\n\nBut freeway 4 at T=14 is safe, as we saw.\n\nIn the car for freeway 4, at T=14, cars: [7,18], [-29,-18], [49,60], none contain 0.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if going up is possible at each step.\n\nSince freeway 5 is safe, and I can go there.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nThe problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if at T=15,16, etc., on freeway 5, but freeway 5 is always safe, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 3 and 4, occupied at T=17,18, but I don't care since I'm not there.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, for example, from y=4 to y=5 at T=15, at the moment of move, but according to the note, when I move at turn T to a new y, I am not on that new freeway until turn T+1.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I move to y_{T+1}, which I occupy at turn T+1.\n\nSo in the collision check, only at the turn I am on the freeway.\n\nIn this sequence, all fine.\n\nBut the car on freeway 1 and 2 are occupied only at T=14, but I'm not on them.\n\nSo seems H=5 is achievable with all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nt₁=14\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nThen y_15=5\n\nTurn 15: U, y_16=6\n\nTurn 16: U, y_17=7\n\nTurn 17: U, y_18=8\n\nTurn 18: U, y_19=9\n\nSo after 5 actions, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? That would require increasing y by 5 in 4 turns, which means some moves with +2 or something, but not possible, since each action changes by at most 1. So min 5 turns.\n\nThus, this should be minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider if at some point I cannot go up, but in this case, I can.\n\nMaybe at T=17, if I were on freeway 4, but I'm not.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is vertical, and freeways are horizontal, I think, but we only care about y-coordinate for freeway and x=0 for collision.\n\nIn the span, it's the position along the freeway, and collision if at x=0.\n\nBut in my calculation, all seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should verify for freeway 4 at T=17.\n\nT=17, τ=3, Δt=3.\n\nFreeway 4 car2: the one with head=-18, tail=-29, right-moving.\n\nAt T=17, span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-29 + 6*3, -18 + 6*3] = [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11, 0]\n\nYes, 0 is in [-11,0], since it includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut in my path, I'm not on freeway 4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nSo for turn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd done.\n\nBut let me see if I can start later or something, but no need.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I stay at T=14, then at T=15, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=15, freeway 4: Δt=1, T=15.\n\nCars:\n\nCar1: [7+6(1), 18+6(1)] = [13,24], no 0\n\nCar2: [-29+6(1), -18+6(1)] = [-23,-12], no 0\n\nCar3: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66], no\n\nSo at T=15, freeway 4 not occupied, but if I stay, I might be there at T=17 or something, but in this case, with all U, I avoid it.\n\nBut no need to stay.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo all U is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at turn 19.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions from t=14 to t=18 inclusive.\n\nt from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nH=5, so t=14,15,16,17,18.\n\nEach action U.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut let me write.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, it has only one car, but not at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,4), which is on freeway 4.\n\nAnd at turn 14, no collision.\n\nThen I move up.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the boundary.\n\ny from 0 to 9, at y=9, I cannot go up, but in this case, when I reach y=8, I go up to y=9.\n\nAt y=8, I can go up to y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to stop, but since I reach exactly, it should be fine.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and after the action, I am at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after last action at turn 18, I go to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSo it should be included.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 14, if I go up, to y=5 at turn 15.\n\nBut turn 15 is T=15, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but no.\n\nI think H=5 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is all U for five turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt₁=14\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 19, position (0,9).\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nSo \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so yes.\n\nSince it says \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=5, actions at t=14,15,16,17,18.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n\nBut in the sequence, all U.\n\nBut is there any reason not to go up immediately?\n\nFor example, at turn 14, if I go up, to y=5 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, y=5, safe.\n\nThen up to y=6 at turn 16.\n\nTurn 16, y=6, safe.\n\nUp to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nUp to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18, y=8, safe.\n\nUp to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIf I stay at turn 14, then at turn 15, I am still at y=4.\n\nAt turn 15, freeway 4 is not occupied, as above.\n\nThen I can go up at turn 15 to y=5 at turn 16.\n\nThen same as before, but now I start moving later, so I reach y=9 at turn 20 or something, worse.\n\nTurn 14: S, y=4 at turn 15.\n\nThen turn 15: U, y=6 at turn 16? No.\n\nAfter action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nSo turn 14: S, then y_15 = y_14 +0 =4\n\nThen at turn 15: U, y_16 =5\n\nThen turn 16: U, y_17=6\n\nTurn 17: U, y_18=7\n\nTurn 18: U, y_19=8\n\nTurn 19: U, y_20=9\n\nSo H=6, worse.\n\nIf I go down, even worse.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 5 turns with all up actions.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4) at turn 14.\n- Freeway 4 is occupied at position \\(x = 0\\) on turns 17 and 18 due to car movements, so the player must not be on freeway 4 at these turns.\n- Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 are never occupied at \\(x = 0\\), so they are safe at all times.\n- The minimum number of turns to increase \\(y\\) from 4 to 9 is 5, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n- A sequence of \"up\" (U) actions from turn 14 to turn 18 achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19 without collisions:\n  - At turn 14: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 15. Freeway 4 at turn 14 is unoccupied (spans [7,18], [-29,-18], [49,60] do not contain 0).\n  - At turn 15: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16. Freeway 5 is unoccupied at turn 15.\n  - At turn 16: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17. Freeway 6 is unoccupied at turn 16.\n  - At turn 17: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18. Freeway 7 is unoccupied at turn 17.\n  - At turn 18: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. Freeway 8 is unoccupied at turn 18, and \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n- This sequence avoids freeways 3 and 4 during their occupied turns (17 and 18) and uses the minimum \\(H = 5\\) turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = 14\\) to \\(t = 18\\) is all \"U\" (up), resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,5) at turn t1=15. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules: for left-moving cars, the span moves left with speed s, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. For right-moving, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn T. Also, when moving to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the y you're currently on.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), that gets from y=5 to y=9 in min turns without colliding.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's not a freeway with cars, since cars are on y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, and no cars there.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars at t1=15 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-60, τ=-25, s=36\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, left-moving, h=-60, τ=-25, s=36\n\nFreeway 3: three cars, all right-moving: (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor freeways 3 and 4, there are multiple cars, but for 5,6,7,8 only one each.\n\nNow, since the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, I need to see for each possible y and time, whether being on that y at that time causes a collision, i.e., if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that time.\n\nThe collision depends on the turn number relative to t1=15.\n\nLet me define the time from t1: let τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn t1.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time τ (after t1), the span for each car.\n\nFirst, for left-moving cars (freeway 1 and 2):\n\nFor freeway 1: car with h=-60, τ=-25, s=36, left-moving.\n\nAt time τ, span is [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ]? No.\n\nFrom the rule: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] but τ is tail, I think it's a typo; it should be tail, not τ, since τ is used for time.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s), and τ is tail.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)] where τ is tail.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the text, it says \"tail is at τ\" and in update, it uses τ for tail, so I'll use \"tail\" to avoid confusion.\n\nSo for left-moving car: at time T, position x from h - s*(T-t1) to tail - s*(T-t1), but since it's moving left, head is left, tail is right? No.\n\nTypically, for a left-moving car, if head is at h and tail at tail, with h < tail since it's moving left? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: h=-60, tail=-25, and direction left.\n\nSince it's left-moving, the head is on the left, tail on the right, so span from min to max should be [h, tail] with h < tail? But h=-60, tail=-25, -60 < -25, so [h, tail] = [-60, -25], which is from left to right? If x decreases to the left, then h=-60 is left, tail=-25 is right, so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nAt time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), tail - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is on the right, tail on left, so [tail, h] with tail < h, and moving right, span [tail + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor freeway 3 cars: (24,13,right,6) — head=24, tail=13, since right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so tail=13 < head=24, so [13,24] at t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision when player is on freeway k at time T, and 0 is in the span of any car on k at that T.\n\nSpecifically, for a car, if min_span <= 0 <= max_span at time T.\n\nSince spans can overlap, but we need to check for each car separately, I think, but since collision if any car has 0 in span, we need that for the freeway, no car has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nNow, for the player, at each turn, from τ=0, starting at y=5.\n\nActions: U: y+1, D: y-1, S: y same, and y between 0 and 9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=5, and need to go to y=9, that's +4 in y, so minimum turns if we go up every turn: 4 turns, but we might need to avoid cars, so it could take more if we have to detour or wait.\n\nBut y=5 to y=9, so we need to increase y by 4.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so min H=4, if we can go U,U,U,U or something.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, the freeways are from y=1 to 8, so when we are on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut we start at y=5, which is a freeway, so we need to check collision at t1 if we stay or move.\n\nAt turn T, when we are on y_T, we check collision for that y_T at time T.\n\nIf we move to a different y, at turn T, we are on y_T, and after action, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, we are on y=5, so we need to check if at time t1, on freeway 5, if there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for future turns.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, and for each time τ (relative), whether it is safe to be on that freeway, i.e., no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway for k=3 and 4, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nAlso, for k=1,2,5,6,7,8, only one car each except 3 and 4 have three.\n\nk=1: one car, k=2: one, k=3: three, k=4: three, k=5: one, k=6: one, k=7: one, k=8: one.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and each τ, if 0 is occupied by any car.\n\nBut τ is discrete, turns.\n\nSince we need to find a path, we might not need all τ, but we can find when each freeway is safe.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: left-moving car, h=-60, tail=-25, s=36.\n\nAt time τ (τ= T-t1), span: [h - s*τ, tail - s*τ] = [-60 -36τ, -25 -36τ]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -60 -36τ <= 0 <= -25 -36τ\n\nBut since -60 -36τ < -25 -36τ always, and both negative for τ>=0, since at τ=0, [-60,-25], both negative, 0 not in between.\n\nNow, -60 -36τ <= 0 is true since left is negative, but 0 <= -25 -36τ? -25 -36τ is always negative for τ>=0, so 0 <= negative number is false. So 0 is never in the span for freeway 1. Similarly for freeway 2, same car, so freeway 1 and 2 are always safe? Is that right?\n\nAt τ=0, span [-60,-25], 0 is not between -60 and -25, since -60 <= x <= -25, x negative, 0 not included.\n\nAs τ increases, min and max decrease, so more negative, so 0 never in span. So yes, for freeway 1 and 2, no car ever at x=0, so always safe to be on y=1 or y=2 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6) so head=24, tail=13, s=6\n\nAt time τ, span: [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] = [13 + 6τ, 24 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if 13 + 6τ <= 0 <= 24 + 6τ\n\nBut 13 + 6τ >=13 >0 for τ>=0, so 0 <= 13 +6τ always true, but 13+6τ <=0? 13+6τ >=13>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-12,-23,right,6) — head=-12, tail=-23? tail=-23, head=-12.\n\nSince right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so if tail=-23, head=-12, then -23 < -12, so at t1, span [tail, head] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt time τ, span [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] = [-23 + 6τ, -12 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 6τ <= 0 <= -12 + 6τ\n\nSo we need -23 + 6τ <= 0 and 0 <= -12 + 6τ\n\nWhich is 6τ <= 23 and 6τ >=12, so τ <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, and τ >= 12/6 =2\n\nSince τ integer, τ=3? τ>=2 and τ<=3.833, so τ=2,3\n\nCheck: τ=2: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 <=0 <=0? 0 is included, since min <=0<= max, min=-11<=0, max=0>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nτ=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, span [-5,6], 0 in between.\n\nτ=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=1: -23+6= -17, -12+6= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nτ=0: [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span at τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nNow third car on freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6) — head=-48, tail=-59\n\ntail=-59, head=-48, so tail < head, -59 < -48.\n\nAt τ, span [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] = [-59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6τ <=0 <= -48 +6τ\n\nSo -59+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <=59/6≈9.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +6τ => 6τ >=48 => τ >=8\n\nSo τ from 8 to 9.833, τ=8,9\n\nτ=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=9: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, we have three cars:\n\n- Car1: never has 0 in span\n\n- Car2: has 0 at τ=2,3\n\n- Car3: has 0 at τ=8,9\n\nTherefore, for freeway 3, collision occurs if at time τ, any car has 0, so at τ=2,3,8,9, there is collision, else safe.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=2 and 3, car2 has 0; at τ=8 and 9, car3 has 0.\n\nNow for freeway 4: same as freeway 3, according to the table: | 4 | (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) | so identical to freeway 3. So same thing, unsafe at τ=2,3,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car: (24,13,right,6) — head=24, tail=13, s=6\n\nAt τ, span [13 +6τ, 24+6τ]\n\n0 in span: 13+6τ <=0 <=24+6τ? 13+6τ >=13>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, (24,13,right,6), always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same, always safe.\n\nAnd freeway 1 and 2 always safe, as before.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 are unsafe at τ=2,3,8,9 relative to t1.\n\nτ is T - t1, so at absolute turn T, τ = T - 15.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t1=15, y=5.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=5 is freeway, but at τ=0, which is T=15, on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has a car, but as above, for freeway 5, the car never has 0 in span, so at τ=0, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other times safe for y=5.\n\nNow, the dangerous freeways are y=3 and y=4, at times when τ=2,3,8,9.\n\nτ=2: T = t1 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17\n\nτ=3: T=18\n\nτ=8: T=15+8=23\n\nτ=9: T=24\n\nSo on freeway y=3 or y=4, at turns 17,18,23,24, there is a collision if player is on it.\n\nOther freeways are always safe.\n\ny=1,2,5,6,7,8 are always safe, except y=3 and y=4 unsafe at specific times.\n\ny=8 is safe, always.\n\nThe player needs to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSince min turns to increase y by 4 is 4, with all U.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are T=17,18 for both y=3 and y=4, and T=23,24.\n\nSince we start at T=15, y=5.\n\nIf we go directly up, we can reach y=9 in 4 turns: at T=15: y=5, action say U, then T=16: y=6, action U, T=17: y=7, action U, T=18: y=8, action U, T=19: y=9.\n\nNow, check if we are on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nAt T=15: y=5, safe, as freeway 5 always safe.\n\nT=16: y=6, safe.\n\nT=17: y=7, which is freeway 7, always safe, not y=3 or 4.\n\nT=18: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nT=19: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we are not on y=3 or y=4 at any time, so no issue with the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are only for y=3 and y=4, and we never go to y=3 or y=4 in this path.\n\nWe start at y=5, go to y=6,7,8,9, all safe freeways.\n\ny=3 and y=4 are below, we are going up, so we avoid them.\n\nBut is there any problem at T=17 and 18? At those times, we are on y=7 and y=8, which are safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=23,24 are later, but we reach y=9 at T=19, so no issue.\n\nSo with 4 turns, we can reach y=9 at T=19.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAt turn T=15: we are at y=5, we take action, say U, so at T=16, we move to y=6.\n\nAt T=16, we are on y=6, take U, to y=7 at T=17.\n\nAt T=17, on y=7, take U, to y=8 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, on y=8, take U, to y=9 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn, we are on the freeway only if y between 1 and 8.\n\nAt T=15: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nT=16: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nT=17: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nT=18: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nT=19: y=9, no freeway.\n\nNo time on y=3 or y=4.\n\nAnd for y=3 and y=4, unsafe at T=17,18,23,24, but we are not on them.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at T=19.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H=4 actions? From t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to when we reach y=9.\n\nWe reach y=9 at T=19, which is after 4 actions.\n\nLet's see the position after actions.\n\nAt turn T, after action, we move to new position for next turn? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at t.\n\nSo at time t, we are at position y_t, take action a_t, then at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe collision is checked at time t, when we are on y_t.\n\nAnd we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, say at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=15, y=5.\n\nWe take action at t1, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, so H actions, and at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn the direct path: action at t=15: U, so y16 = y15 +1 =6\n\nAction at t=16: U, y17=7\n\nAction at t=17: U, y18=8\n\nAction at t=18: U, y19=9\n\nSo at t=19, y=9, so we need actions from t=15 to t=18, so H=4 actions.\n\nNow, at each turn, collision check: at t=15, y=5, safe.\n\nt=16, y=6, safe.\n\nt=17, y=7, safe.\n\nt=18, y=8, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since min is 4.\n\nBut we might need to avoid something, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps at the unsafe times, but we are not on y=3 or 4.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, we are not on the new freeway until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps for y=5 to y=9, we have to pass through, but y=5,6,7,8 are all safe except y=3 and 4 which we skip.\n\ny=3 and 4 are below 5, we go up, so we don't go through them.\n\nIn terms of y levels, from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9, we are on y=5,6,7,8 at turns, all safe.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we might be at risk, but no.\n\nPerhaps I should check for freeway 5,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 5: car (24,13,right,6), at τ=0, span [13,24], not include 0.\n\nAt τ=1, [19,30], etc., never 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 all same car, always safe.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 always safe.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 unsafe at τ=2,3 (T=17,18) and τ=8,9 (T=23,24).\n\nBut since we are done by T=19, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nAt turn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are at turns 15 to 18.\n\nIn the answer, it should list actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=4 is minimum since we need to increase by 4.\n\nWe could go faster, but only +1 per turn, so no.\n\nOr if we stay, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case 4.\n\nBut let me see if we need to be careful at T=17 or 18.\n\nAt T=17, if we were on y=3 or 4, collision, but we are on y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly T=18, on y=8, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player could go down or something, but that would take longer, not minimal.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, at T=17 and 18, which is τ=2 and 3, unsafe, but we avoid.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,5), and we move vertically, so x is always 0, I think, since we don't move horizontally.\n\nThe position is (x,y), but x is fixed at 0, I believe, since we only move vertically.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nAnd cars are on the freeways, and collision when player at (0,y) and y is freeway, and 0 in car span on that freeway.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in this case, with 4 up actions, we reach.\n\nBut let me list the actions clearly.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 15: a_{15} = U\n\nAt turn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nAt turn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nAt turn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nThen at turn 19, position (0,9)\n\nSo H=4 turns of actions? H is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence index.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, with y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} so Turn 15: U\n\nTurn 15 + 1: a_{15+1} so Turn 16: U\n\netc.\n\nUp to Turn 18: U\n\nBut we don't need action at turn 19, since at turn 19 we are already at y=9 after the action at 18.\n\nThe last action is at turn 18, which moves to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any constraint I missed?\n\nThe note about moving: when you move to a new y, you are not on it until next turn, so for example, if at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} != y_T, then at turn T, you are only on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so you don't check collision for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn this path, we are always moving to different y except possibly if we stay, but here we always go up, so y changes each turn.\n\nAt each turn, we are only on one freeway.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSuppose at some point we need to be on y=4, but we don't.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, at some time, but no, always safe.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 5, at τ=0, span [13,24], not include 0.\n\nEven if it did, but it doesn't.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nBut the problem might expect a sequence, and perhaps I should output it.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be the actions.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? No, because from y=5 to y=9, need 4 steps up, each U increases by 1, and S or D would keep or decrease, so min 4 actions.\n\nIf we could move faster, but no, only +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo H=4 is minimum.\n\nAnd achievable as above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer by being at y=9 earlier, but no, starting from y=5, after k actions, y <= 5 + k, so to have y=9, need at least 4 actions.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = 5 + number of U minus number of D, since S keeps.\n\nTo have 5 + U - D =9, so U - D =4, with U + D + S = H, and S doesn't change, so min H when no S or D, all U, H=4.\n\nIf we have D, we need more U, so H larger.\n\nThus min H=4.\n\nAnd we have a safe sequence.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 3 and 4, there are multiple cars, but we don't go there.\n\nPerhaps the player could go down to avoid something, but no need.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player Movement**: The player can move up (U, increasing \\(y\\) by 1), down (D, decreasing \\(y\\) by 1), or stay (S, no change in \\(y\\)). The vertical position \\(y\\) must stay within \\([0, 9]\\).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) at turn \\(T\\), and the horizontal position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n- **Car Dynamics**:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\): Always safe (no car spans include \\(x = 0\\) at any turn).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 3\\): Unsafe at turns \\(T = 17\\) (\\(\\tau = 2\\)) and \\(T = 18\\) (\\(\\tau = 3\\)) due to cars, and also at \\(T = 23\\) and \\(T = 24\\), but these later turns are not relevant for minimal path.\n  - Freeway \\(y = 4\\): Unsafe at the same turns as \\(y = 3\\) (\\(T = 17, 18, 23, 24\\)).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\): Always safe (no car spans include \\(x = 0\\) at any turn).\n- **Path to Goal**: The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) (turn 15) and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\). The minimum number of turns \\(H\\) is 4, achieved by moving up (U) four times, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. This path avoids the unsafe freeways (\\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\)) and the unsafe turns (\\(T = 17\\) and \\(T = 18\\)):\n  - At turn 15: On \\(y = 5\\) (safe), take U to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16.\n  - At turn 16: On \\(y = 6\\) (safe), take U to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17.\n  - At turn 17: On \\(y = 7\\) (safe), take U to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18.\n  - At turn 18: On \\(y = 8\\) (safe), take U to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - Turn 15 (\\(y = 5\\)): Freeway 5 is safe (car span [13, 24] does not include 0).\n  - Turn 16 (\\(y = 6\\)): Freeway 6 is safe (car span [19, 30] does not include 0).\n  - Turn 17 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 is safe (car span [25, 36] does not include 0); avoid \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) which are unsafe.\n  - Turn 18 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 is safe (car span [31, 42] does not include 0); avoid \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\).\n- **Minimal Turns**: \\(H = 4\\) is the minimum, as \\(y\\) must increase by 4, and each U increases \\(y\\) by 1. Any detour (e.g., using D or S) would require more turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 15\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18\\) is all U (up), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) at turn 16 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right at constant speeds. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new freeway, you're not on it until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on freeway y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you're still considered on y_T for that turn, and you only enter y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision at turn T, it only matters what's happening on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there. But to get there, I might need to be on freeways 7 or 8 or something.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so once I'm at y=9, I'm safe, and that's the target.\n\nCurrent position: (0,6) at turn 16.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 48, tail 83, direction left, speed 36. But direction left means it's moving left, so since head is 48 and tail 83, that seems odd. Typically for left-moving, head should be smaller if it's moving left, but let's see the update rule.\n\nThe update rule says:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAt turn t1, span is [h, τ], which for this car is [48,83]. Since it's moving left, as time increases, both h and τ decrease.\n\nBut head and tail: I think \"head\" might be the front of the car. If it's moving left, and direction is left, then at turn t1, if it's at [48,83], but 48 to 83 is increasing to the right, I assume. So if it's moving left, the front should be the left end if it's moving left? I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, span is [τ, h], which suggests that τ is the tail and h is the head, so for right-moving, head is larger, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], but if it's moving left, the head should be smaller, so [h, τ] with h < τ? But in the freeway 1, it says (48,83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83, and since direction left, span at t1 is [48,83], which implies 48 to 83, so from left to right, but moving left, so the left end is the head.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, both decrease, so at time T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so the span moves left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, and both increase.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48,83, left, 36), so at t1=16, span is [48,83], moving left at 36 per turn.\n\nBut 48 to 83 is 35 units? Length is |83-48|+1? But for collision, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36)\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so for first car: τ=19, h=30? But it says (30,19,right,6), so head=30, tail=19? But in the notation, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be larger.\n\nLet's see: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, so for (30,19,right,6), it might be head=30, tail=19, so at t1, span [19,30] since [τ,h] = [19,30].\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-6,-17,right,6), so τ=-17, h=-6, span [-17,-6]\n\nThird car: (-42,-53,right,6), τ=-53, h=-42, span [-53,-42]\n\nAnd all moving right at speed 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3: three cars identical.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car: (30,19,right,6), so head=30, tail=19, span at t1 [19,30], moving right speed 6.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (30,19,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 each have one car: (30,19,right,6), so span [19,30] at t1=16, moving right at 6 per turn.\n\nNow, t1=16 is the current turn.\n\nI need to find actions from turn 16 onwards to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny starts at 6 at turn 16.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 6 to 9, minimum 3 moves up, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 3.\n\nBut since there might be obstacles, it could take more turns.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn.\n\nSo for example, at turn T, you are on y_T. You choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are still on y_T, so collision check only for y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check for that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nTo reach (0,9), y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible there. But to get to y=9, I need to be at y=8 and move up, for example.\n\ny=9 is the top row, so to be at (0,9), I need to be at y=8 at some turn and move up to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, I start at y=6.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and for future turns, when 0 is covered by a car, so that I should not be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's define ΔT = T - t1 = T - 16, so at T=16, ΔT=0.\n\nFor each freeway, find when 0 is in the span of any car at turn T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: left-moving, h=48, τ=83, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 is in span if 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT\n\nSince the car is moving left, and span is decreasing.\n\n48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 48 ≤ 36ΔT ⇒ ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2 since ΔT integer? T and ΔT are integers, turns are discrete.\n\nΔT = T - 16, integer.\n\nSo 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 36ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≥ 2\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT ⇒ 36ΔT ≤ 83 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nΔT ≤ 2 and ΔT ≥ 2, so ΔT = 2\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=18, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], so 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=17, span [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=16, [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=3, T=19, span [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so collision only at T=18.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, head=30, tail=19, so at t1, span [19,30], speed 6, right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [19 + 6ΔT, 30 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 19 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 30 + 6ΔT\n\n19 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ -19, impossible since ΔT≥0, 19+6ΔT ≥19>0, so 0 never ≤ 19+6ΔT? Let's see:\n\n0 ≥ 19 + 6ΔT? No.\n\n0 in [L,R] if L ≤ 0 ≤ R.\n\nSo L = 19 + 6ΔT ≥ 19 >0, so L >0, so 0 < L ≤ R, so 0 not ≤ L, so 0 not in [L,R] since L>0.\n\nSimilarly, for all ΔT, L=19+6ΔT ≥19>0, so 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSecond car: (-6,-17,right,6), so tail τ=-17, head h=-6, span at t1 [-17,-6]\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-17 + 6ΔT, -6 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -17 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -6 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst, -17 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 17 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -6 + 6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥ 6 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 1\n\nSo for ΔT=1 and 2.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=17, span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11, 0], 0 is included? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=18, span [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5, 6], -5 ≤ 0 ≤ 6, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=16, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=3, T=19, [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 1≤0? No, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=17 and T=18 for this car on freeway 3.\n\nBut there are multiple cars; if any car has 0 in span, collision.\n\nThird car: (-42,-53,right,6), tail τ=-53, head h=-42, span at t1 [-53,-42]\n\nSpan at T: [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst, -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 53 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so ΔT ≤ 8\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥ 42 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 7\n\nSo for ΔT=7 and 8.\n\nAt ΔT=7, T=23, span [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=8, T=24, span [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut for now, near future, not relevant since we want minimal H, probably small.\n\nFor freeway 3, from first car no collision, second car collision at T=17 and 18, third car later.\n\nSo overall, on freeway 3, collision possible at T=17 and T=18.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so also collision at T=17 and 18.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nOne car: (30,19,right,6), so same as first car on freeway 3.\n\nSpan at T: [19 + 6ΔT, 30 + 6ΔT]\n\nL=19+6ΔT ≥19>0, so 0 not in span for any ΔT, so no collision on freeway 5 ever? From this car.\n\nBut only one car, so freeway 5 is always safe? Let's confirm.\n\nAt any T, span [19+6ΔT, 30+6ΔT] >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, one car like above, no collision.\n\nFreeway 7: same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 8: same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 each have one car with span starting from 19 at ΔT=0, moving right, so min position is 19 at T=16, increasing, so always >0, so 0 never in span. So these freeways are always safe; no collision possible.\n\nIs that right? At ΔT=0, [19,30], 0 not in. As ΔT increases, it moves right, so even less likely. So yes, freeways 5,6,7,8 are always safe; I can be on them at any time without collision.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 have collision at T=18.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 have collision at T=17 and 18.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=6 to y=9.\n\ny=6 at turn 16.\n\ny=9 is the target position, so I need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nTo be at (0,9), I need to have y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince actions change y, and I start at turn 16, y=6.\n\nAfter one action, at turn 17, y could be 5,6,7.\n\nThen turn 18, y=4,5,6,7,8, etc., up to 9.\n\nI need to minimize H, the number of turns from t1=16.\n\nH is the number of actions, so after H actions, at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at position.\n\nThen I take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSequence of actions from t= t1 to t1 + H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at (0,y_{t1}) = (0,6)\n\nAfter first action (t=t1=16), at turn t1+1=17, I am at y_{17}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, I am at y_{t1+k}\n\nI reach (0,9) when y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe turn when y_t=9, that is when I reach.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, actions, and at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see the indices.\n\nTurn t1: position y_{t1}, take action a_{t1}, then at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+1, take a_{t1+1}, to set y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}\n\nI need y_{t1+H} =9 for some H.\n\nThe minimal H such that I can achieve y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nSince I start at y=6, and need to be at 9, minimum H=3 if I go up each time.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when collision occurs.\n\nNow, collision depends on the turn and the y-position at that turn.\n\nAt each turn T, when I am on y_T, which is a freeway if y_T between 1 and 8, I need that no car on that freeway has 0 in span at T.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 are always safe, no problem.\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 have collision only at T=18.\n\nFreeways 3 and 4 have collision at T=17 and T=18.\n\nNow, I start at turn 16, y=6.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, which is safe, no collision.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nPossible to go up directly, but I need to check turns 17 and 18.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nMinimal H: if I go up at turn 16, to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, y=7, which is freeway 7, safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, I can go up again to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 18, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 18, go up to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSo at turn 19, y=9, reached.\n\nH: actions from turn 16 to 18, three actions: a16, a17, a18.\n\nAfter a18, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 16 to turn 19, but turns involved: 16,17,18 for actions, and position at 17,18,19.\n\nIn terms of H, the minimal number of turns to reach.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=16, so at turn 16+H, position.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nSo for H=3, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 16: action U, to y=7 at turn 17\n\nAt turn 17, on y=7, which is safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at turn 18\n\nAt turn 18, on y=8, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nNow, during this, at no point was I on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nAt turn 16: on y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nTurn 18: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nAnd freeways 3,4 have problems at 17 and 18, but I was not on them.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1,2 at 18, not on them.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut is there a way with H=2?\n\nWith H=2 actions: at turn 16, action to set y17.\n\nThen at turn 17, action to set y18.\n\nAfter two actions, at turn 18, y18 could be 9?\n\nStart y16=6.\n\nAfter first action (turn 16), y17 = 6 + Δy16, which can be 5,6,7.\n\nThen at turn 17, action to set y18 = y17 + Δy17.\n\ny18 needs to be 9.\n\nSo if y17=7, then I can go up to y18=8, not 9.\n\ny17 must be 8 to go up to 9.\n\nBut y17 can be at most 7 if I go up from 6: y17=7.\n\nThen from 7, I can go to 8, not to 9 directly.\n\ny17 cannot be 8 from y16=6 in one step; max y17=7.\n\nSimilarly, min y17=5.\n\nSo y17 can be 5,6,7.\n\nThen y18 = y17 + Δy17, which can be y17-1, y17, y17+1.\n\nTo have y18=9, since y17<=7, y18 <=8, so y18=9 impossible with two actions.\n\nWith one action: from y16=6, y17 max 7, not 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 3, as above.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be on a bad freeway.\n\nIn the sequence: all on y=6,7,8, all freeways 6,7,8, which are safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, which is safe, yes.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 6 has a car, but as we saw, it never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a reason to take a different path? For example, if I go to y=5 or something, but that would take more turns to reach 9, so not minimal.\n\nPerhaps to avoid some collision, but in this case, no need.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 3 and 4 at T=17 and 18.\n\nFor example, if I were on y=3 at turn 17, collision, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 18, if on y=1,2,3,4, collision possible, but I'm on y=8, safe.\n\ny=4 at turn 18: freeway 4 has collision at T=18? Freeway 4 has cars, and at T=18, which is ΔT=2.\n\nFor freeway 4, same as 3.\n\nAt T=18, ΔT=2.\n\nFor second car on freeway 3/4: at ΔT=2, span [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I'm not on it.\n\nSo the sequence should be fine.\n\nBut the answer format should be the actions.\n\nNow, turn t1=16.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: action U\n\nThen at turn 17, y=7, I take U again to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, take U to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: from t=16 to t=18.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} which is U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} which is U\n\nThen at turn t_1 +3 =19, y=9.\n\nH=3 turns? Number of actions is 3.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1}, t=1, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter that, at turn t1 + H, position.\n\nSet to (0,9).\n\nSo for H=3, actions at t=16,17,18.\n\na16, a17, a18 all U.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=2? As I thought, no.\n\nPerhaps if I start by staying or something, but y cannot jump, so no.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 16, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut suppose I want to go through other paths, but it would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=5, then I need to go up to 6,7,8,9, which is at least 4 actions, worse.\n\nSimilarly, staying or whatever.\n\nSo minimal H=3 with three ups.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions to be thorough.\n\nAt turn 16: I am on y=6, freeway 6.\n\nCar on freeway 6: at ΔT=0, span [19,30], not including 0, safe.\n\nTurn 17: I move to y=7? After action at turn 16, U, so at turn 17, y=7, on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 car: similar, span [19+6(17-16)=19+6=25,30+6=36], [25,36], not 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 18: after action at turn 17, U, so at turn 18, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCar: [19+6(18-16)=19+12=31,30+12=42], [31,42], not 0, safe.\n\nThen action at turn 18, U, to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nNow, what if I do something else, like at turn 16, I go down to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nThen on freeway 5 at turn 17: freeway 5 car, span [19+6(17-16)=25,36], not 0, safe.\n\nBut then I need to go to 9, which takes more actions.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at turn 16, y=6 at turn 17, same as start, then I still need to go up twice.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps to avoid y=8 at some time, but y=8 is safe.\n\nAnother point: freeway 8 has a car, but it never covers 0, as we said.\n\nBut just to be sure, the car on freeway 8: (30,19,right,6), but head=30, tail=19, so at t1, [19,30], moving right, so positions increase, min 19 at t1, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for freeway 3 and 4, at T=17 and 18, collision.\n\nFor example, at T=17, ΔT=1, on freeway 3, second car span [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly at T=18, [-5,6] includes 0.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 and 2 at T=18: for freeway 1, at T=18, ΔT=2, span [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], includes 0.\n\nBut again, not on it.\n\nSo the direct up path is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3, with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turns: t1=16, t1+0=16, t1+1=17, t1+2=18.\n\nActions: a_{16} = U, a_{17} = U, a_{18} = U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at turn 16, I stay, y=6 at turn 17.\n\nThen at turn 17, I go up to y=7 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, go up to y=8 at turn 19, then need another action to go to y=9 at turn 20, which is H=4, worse.\n\nIf I go up twice from turn 17 and 18, but from y=6 at turn 17, I can go to y=7 at turn 18, then to y=8 at turn 19, still need to turn 19 to go to 9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo indeed, starting with up at turn 16 is best.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 directly or something, but no, only one step change.\n\nSo I think H=3 is minimal.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt1 is 16, so:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=2, so three actions.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U }\n\nBut in the box.\n\nSince it says \"a_{t_1 + t}\" for t=0,1,2.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be listed.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 3 and 4.\n\nFor freeway 3 at T=17: ΔT=1, second car: τ=-17, h=-6, span at T: [-17 +6(1), -6+6(1)] = [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, is 0 included? The span is [-11,0], which is from x=-11 to x=0 inclusive, I assume, so x=0 is part of the car, so yes, collision if on y=3 at T=17.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18, [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut I avoid it.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1 at T=18: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11], includes 0.\n\nBut not on it.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is three ups.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the optimal sequence of actions is three consecutive \"up\" actions (\\(U\\)).\n\n- At turn 16, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19, with \\(H = 3\\) turns (actions at turns 16, 17, and 18).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 16**: Player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 has a car with span \\([19 + 6 \\cdot 0, 30 + 6 \\cdot 0] = [19, 30]\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\) (turn 16), which does not include 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 17**: Player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 has a car with span \\([19 + 6 \\cdot 1, 30 + 6 \\cdot 1] = [25, 36]\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 1\\) (turn 17), which does not include 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 18**: Player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 has a car with span \\([19 + 6 \\cdot 2, 30 + 6 \\cdot 2] = [31, 42]\\) at \\(\\Delta T = 2\\) (turn 18), which does not include 0. Safe.\n\nDangerous freeways and turns:\n- Freeways 1 and 2 have collisions at turn 18 (e.g., freeway 1 span \\([-24, 11]\\) includes 0).\n- Freeways 3 and 4 have collisions at turns 17 and 18 (e.g., freeway 3 second car span \\([-11, 0]\\) at turn 17 and \\([-5, 6]\\) at turn 18 include 0).\nThe player avoids these by staying on freeways 6, 7, and 8, which are always safe.\n\n### Minimal \\(H\\) Justification:\n- With \\(H = 2\\) actions, the maximum \\(y\\) achievable is 8 (e.g., \\(U\\) at turn 16 to \\(y=7\\) at turn 17, then \\(U\\) at turn 17 to \\(y=8\\) at turn 18), which is not the target \\(y=9\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 7) at turn t1 = 17. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y=k (for k=1 to 8) and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that new freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T, you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T during turn T, and only on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision, we care about where the player is at each turn, and the cars on that row at that turn.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway k=1 to 8. I need to find where the cars are at any future turn relative to t1=17.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at t1=17:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head 12, tail 47, left direction, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] = [12, 47]. But direction is left, so for left-moving cars, span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h and τ decrease over time.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: head=12, tail=47, direction left, speed=36.\n\nBut if direction is left, and it's moving left, the head should be on the left, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the notation, h is head, τ is tail. If it's moving left, and left is decreasing x, then head should be the left end, I think.\n\nIn the description: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) is given as [τ, h], which might be confusing.\n\nLook at freeway 3, for example: it has cars with (36,25,right,6), but span(t1) is given as [τ, h] for right-moving? No.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor each car, it's listed as (h, τ, d, s)\n\nThen for direction:\n\n- If d=left, span(t1) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- If d=right, span(t1) = [τ, h]? No, from the update rule.\n\nIn the update rule, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, d, s). So for right-moving, when d=right, span(t1) is [τ, h], meaning τ is the left end and h is the right end? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\n- For left-moving car: at t1, span is [h, τ], and since moving left, both decrease.\n\n- For right-moving car: at t1, span is [τ, h], and both increase.\n\nIn the car state, for a car, h and τ are given, but for right-moving, h is the head, which should be the front, so for right-moving, head is on the right, tail on left, so span should be [tail, head] for the positions.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head on left, tail on right, span [head, tail].\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h and τ, and h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nFor right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ and h, τ increases, h increases.\n\nNow, in the car state table, for each car, it's (head h, tail τ, d, s)\n\nSo for a given car:\n\n- If d=left, head h is left end, tail τ is right end, span [h, τ]\n\n- If d=right, head h is right end, tail τ is left end, span [τ, h]\n\nBut in the update rule, for right-moving, it's written as [τ, h], which matches if τ is left, h is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ], h left, τ right.\n\nIn the freeway 3, for example, there is a car (36,25,right,6). Since d=right, head h=36 is right end, tail τ=25 is left end? That doesn't make sense because 25 < 36, so if τ=25, h=36, and d=right, then left end is τ=25, right end is h=36, so span [25,36] at t1.\n\nThen for right-moving, at T, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [25 + 6(T-17), 36 + 6(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut in freeway 3, it has multiple cars: (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y=k, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_T) at turn T, so for row y_T, if there is a car where 0 is in [left, right] of its span at T.\n\nSince the grid is in x, but player is always at x=0, we only care if x=0 is occupied by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=7 at t1=17.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and no cars on y=9 since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once at y=9, no collision possible, I think. y=9 might be safe, or not a freeway.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision on y=0 or y=9.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7, which is freeway 7? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=7 is freeway 7.\n\ny=7 has cars.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=7, since y increases by 1 each move up, minimal moves would be two ups: U, U, to go to y=8 then y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if at the turns, when at y=7, y=8, there is no collision.\n\nPlayer position at each turn:\n\nAt turn t=17, player is at y=7.\n\nThen action a_{17} is applied, so at turn t=18, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy based on a_{17}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAction a_t is taken, which determines Δy for y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after action a_t, at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we look at y_T and the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, when you move, at turn T, you are at y_T, and you take action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are on row y_T.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and cars on row y_T at T.\n\nIf you move to a new row, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, for the sequence: we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after H turns, y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1=17, position y_{17} =7.\n\nAfter action a_{17}, at turn 18, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{17 + t}, at turn 17 + t +1? Let's index properly.\n\nLet t be the turn index from t1.\n\nAt time τ = t1 + t for t=0,1,2,... but actions are taken at each turn.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T.\n\nThen y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nCollision checked at turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, the position should be (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, we have gone through H turns: from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1? Let's think.\n\nStart: turn t1, position y_{t1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position at turn t1+1 is y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, position at turn t1+2 is y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k-1}, position at turn t1 + k is y_{t1 + k} = y_{t1 + k-1} + Δy_{t1 + k-1}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, we have H+1 positions: from t1 to t1+H.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after that, at turn (t1 + H), y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we need no collision at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1? Collision is checked at each turn when the player is on a freeway.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, collision possible.\n\nAt turn t1+H, if y_{t1+H}=9, not on freeway, so no collision check needed, since y=9 not freeway.\n\nSimilarly, at start, y_{t1}=7, which is freeway, so collision possible.\n\nSo for turns from T = t1 to t1 + H -1, we need no collision, because at T=t1+H, y=9, safe.\n\nTurns: T = t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-1, all have y_T <=8, so need no collision at those turns.\n\nAt T=t1+H, y=9, no collision.\n\nNumber of actions H, and we reach y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFrom y=7 to y=9, minimal actions are two U, so H=2, if possible.\n\nWith H=2: actions at t=17 and t=18.\n\nAction a_{17}: U, then at turn 18, y_{18} =7 +1 =8\n\nThen action a_{18}: U, then at turn 19, y_{19} =8+1=9\n\nNow, need no collision at turn 17 and turn 18.\n\nAt turn 17: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt turn 18: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nNow, check cars on freeway 7 at turn 17, and freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nFirst, freeway 7 at turn 17.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: from table, freeway 7: (36,25,right,6), but it has multiple? Look:\n\n| Freeway 7 | (36,25,right,6) | but in table, for freeway 3 and 4, it has three cars, but for 7, it says (36,25,right,6), similarly for 8.\n\nLook at the table:\n\nFor freeway k:\n\n1: one car (12,47,left,36)\n\n2: one car (12,47,left,36)\n\n3: three cars: (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\n4: same as 3: three cars\n\n5: one car (36,25,right,6)\n\n6: one car (36,25,right,6)\n\n7: one car (36,25,right,6)\n\n8: one car (36,25,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 7, only one car: head=36, tail=25, direction=right, speed=6.\n\nSince direction right, at t1=17, span is [τ, h] = [25,36]? From the notation.\n\nd=right, so span(t1) = [τ, h] = [25,36] because τ=tail, which is left end, h=head, right end.\n\nAt turn T, span = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, at turn 17 (t1=17), for freeway 7, car: d=right, s=6, τ=25, h=36? τ and h given as (36,25,right,6), but head h=36, tail τ=25, d=right.\n\nSince d=right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt any turn T, span = [25 + 6(T-17), 36 + 6(T-17)]\n\nCollision at turn T on freeway 7 if 0 is in [25 + 6(T-17), 36 + 6(T-17)]\n\nSince 25 + 6(T-17) >0 for T>=17, and increasing, so 0 is never in this interval because left end is at least 25 >0, so 0 not in [something positive, larger positive], so no collision possible on freeway 7 at any time for this car. Similarly for other cars if present, but here only one car.\n\nFreeway 7 has only this car, and since span starts at [25,36] and moves right, always positive, so x=0 never occupied. So freeway 7 is always safe at all turns? At turn 17, span [25,36], 0 not in, and as T increases, it moves right, so always x>25>0, so yes, freeway 7 has no car that can be at x=0, so no collision possible on row 7 at any turn.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8: same thing, one car (36,25,right,6), so span at T: [25 + 6(T-17), 36 + 6(T-17)] always >0, so never at x=0, so freeway 8 is also always safe.\n\nTherefore, for the player, at turn 17, on y=7, no collision since freeway 7 safe.\n\nAt turn 18, if y=8, on freeway 8, which is also safe.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9, safe.\n\nSo with two U actions: a_{17} = U, a_{18} = U, we reach y=9 at turn 19, and no collision at turn 17 or 18.\n\nH=2 turns of actions.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=17 to t=18, actions at t=17 and t=18.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (since t1=17)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 17 and 18, indeed no collision.\n\nAt turn 17, t=17, y=7, freeway 7, car span [25 + 6(17-17), 36 + 6(17-17)] = [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 18, t=18, y=8, freeway 8, car span [25 + 6(18-17), 36 + 6(18-17)] = [25+6,36+6] = [31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut is y=9 a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is not, so no cars, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 not freeway.\n\nBut player starts at y=7, which is freeway.\n\nIn this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me check other freeways to see if there are any cars that could be at x=0.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (12,47,left,36)\n\nd=left, so at t1=17, span [h, τ] = [12,47]\n\nAt T, span [12 - 36(T-17), 47 - 36(T-17)]\n\nCollision if 0 in [12 - 36(T-17), 47 - 36(T-17)]\n\nSet L(T) = 12 - 36(T-17)\n\nR(T) = 47 - 36(T-17)\n\n0 in [L(T), R(T)] if L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nL(T) <=0 when 12 - 36(T-17) <=0 => 36(T-17) >=12 => T-17 >= 12/36 = 1/3, so T >= 17 + 1/3, since T integer, T >= 18\n\nR(T) >=0 when 47 - 36(T-17) >=0 => 36(T-17) <=47 => T-17 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T <= 18 since T integer? 47/36=1.305, so T-17 <=1.305, since T integer, T-17 <=1, so T<=18\n\nT-17 <= floor(47/36) but 47/36=1.305, so T-17 <=1, T<=18\n\nAnd L(T) <=0 for T>=18\n\nR(T) >=0 for T<=18? T-17 <= 47/36≈1.305, so for T=17, T-17=0, R=47>0\n\nT=18, T-17=1, R=47-36=11>0\n\nT=19, T-17=2, R=47-72=-25<0\n\nL(T)=12 -36(T-17)\n\nT=17: L=12>0\n\nT=18: L=12-36=-24<0\n\nT=19: L=12-72=-60<0\n\nFor T=18: L= -24 <=0, R=11>=0, so 0 in [-24,11]? -24 to 11, yes, 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nSimilarly, for T=17: L=12, R=47, both >0, 0 not in [12,47]\n\nT=18: L=-24, R=11, -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nT=19: L=-60, R=-25, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision at T=18 only.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same car, so collision at T=18.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 have collision at T=18.\n\nNow, for freeway 3: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,6) d=right, so span at T: [τ + s(T-17), h + s(T-17)] = [25 +6(T-17), 36 +6(T-17)] always >0, never at 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) d=right, head=0, tail=-11? (h,τ,d,s) = (0,-11,right,6)\n\nd=right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0] because τ=-11, h=0.\n\nThen at T, span [ -11 + 6(T-17), 0 + 6(T-17) ] = [ -11 +6(T-17), 6(T-17) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -11 +6(T-17), 6(T-17) ]\n\nSet S = T-17\n\n0 in [ -11 +6S, 6S ]\n\nNow, -11 +6S <=0 <=6S\n\nLeft: -11 +6S <=0 => 6S <=11 => S<=11/6≈1.833, so S<=1 since integer\n\nRight: 0<=6S always for S>=0\n\nSo for S=0: T=17, [ -11, 0], 0 is included? [ -11, 0], is 0 in it? Depending on if inclusive.\n\nThe span is [left, right], and if it includes the endpoints, then 0 is in [ -11, 0] if inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, in mathematics, [a,b] includes a and b if closed interval.\n\nI think we should assume closed interval, so if left <= 0 <= right, collision.\n\nFor [ -11, 0], -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for S=1: T=18, span [ -11+6, 6] = [-5, 6], 0 in [-5,6]\n\nS=2: T=19, [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in since 1>0\n\nS=0: T=17, [ -11, 0], 0 in\n\nS=1: T=18, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nS=2: T=19, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,6) d=right, h=-36, τ=-47? (h,τ,d,s)=(-36,-47,right,6)\n\nd=right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 +6(S), -36 +6(S) ] where S=T-17\n\nAlways negative, since min is -47 +0 = -47 <0, max at S large, but always <= -36 <0? For S=0, [-47,-36], all negative.\n\nS=1, [-41,-30], neg\n\nS=2, [-35,-24], neg, etc., never >=0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, at T=17, second car has span [-11,0], so 0 is in, collision if player on row 3 at T=17.\n\nAt T=18, second car span [-5,6], 0 in, collision.\n\nAt T=19, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut back to player.\n\nIn our case, for the direct path, we only care about row 7 and 8.\n\nRow 7: as I said earlier, car (36,25,right,6), span at T [25+6(S), 36+6(S)] with S=T-17, always >25>0, so 0 never in, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8: same, safe.\n\nNow, what about row 6? But player not going there, but just to know.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (36,25,right,6), same as 7 and 8, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 4: similar to 3, has three cars.\n\nFreeway 4: cars (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 3, so at T=17 and T=18, the second car causes collision on row 4 if player there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 have collisions at T=17 and T=18.\n\nBut for our player, starting at y=7 at t=17, which is row 7, safe.\n\nThen if move to y=8 at t=18, row 8 safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? Minimal H is 2.\n\nPerhaps if there was collision, but here no.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=17, player at y=7.\n\nAt turn 17: position y=7, freeway 7, no collision as above.\n\nAction a_{17}=U, so at turn 18, y=8.\n\nAt turn 18: position y=8, freeway 8, no collision.\n\nAction a_{18}=U, so at turn 19, y=9, safe.\n\nReached in H=2 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=17 to t=18, two actions.\n\nThe sequence should be actions at t=17 and t=18.\n\nIn the answer format, it says {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for H=2, t=0,1: a_{17} and a_{18}\n\nThen at turn t1 + H =19, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we do nothing or down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=7, but at turn 17 it's safe, but then we need to go up later, so H larger.\n\nBut since we can go directly, H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a car on row 7 or 8 that could cause issue? No, as analyzed.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to new row.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=7 to y=8 at action a_{17}=U, at turn 17, we are still on y=7, so affected by cars on row 7 at turn 17, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 18, we are on y=8, affected by cars on row 8 at turn 18, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIf we were to move to a row at a time when collision, but here not.\n\nSo minimal H=2 with actions U,U.\n\nBut let me check if row 9 is reachable directly or something, but no.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving down or staying avoids something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother point: the player can only move to adjacent y, so from 7 to 9 directly not possible, must go through 8.\n\nSo H=2 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, feasible.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 1 and 2, there is collision at T=18, but since player not on row 1 or 2, no problem.\n\nSimilarly for row 3 and 4, collision at T=17 and 18, but player not there.\n\nSo for this path, no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at t=17 and U at t=18.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} = U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U }\n\nSince t1=17.\n\nIn the box, it should be written as:\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so probably use symbols.\n\nIn the answer format given: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine to write with t_1.\n\nSince it says \"in the answer format\", and it has \\{t_1\\}, so use t_1.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: a_{t_1} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U }\n\nAnd H=2, but H is not to be specified, only the sequence.\n\nThe sequence has H actions.\n\nIn the box, only the actions.\n\nNow, but wait, is there a possibility that at turn 17, if we stay or down, we can avoid something, but no need.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, but it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 8 has car, but as above, safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (36,25,right,6), span at T [25 +6(S), 36+6(S)] with S=T-17.\n\nAt T=18, S=1, [31,42], not including 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the player is at (0,7) at t=17, and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the action, we go to y=8 at t=18, then y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, y=9, which is the goal, and no action needed after that, I think.\n\nThe sequence up to when we reach.\n\nWith two actions, we reach.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in one action? From y=7 to y=9? No, only +1 per action, so impossible, H=2 minimum.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 3,4, etc., but not relevant.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is two U moves.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"a_{t_1}\", so probably include the action.\n\nBut in the box, it might be written as:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nYes.\n\nSince it says \"a_{t_1}\", but in the text, we can write U.\n\nI think it's clear.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis for Minimal Path\n- The direct path from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least two \"Up\" (U) actions, as each U action increases the y-coordinate by 1.\n- With actions:\n  - At turn 17: \\(a_{17} = U\\), so at turn 18, \\(y_{18} = 7 + 1 = 8\\).\n  - At turn 18: \\(a_{18} = U\\), so at turn 19, \\(y_{19} = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nNow, check for collisions at each turn where the player is on a freeway (i.e., \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)):\n- **Turn 17 (\\(y = 7\\), freeway 7)**:  \n  Freeway 7 has one car: \\((h = 36, \\tau = 25, d = \\text{right}, s = 6)\\).  \n  Since \\(d = \\text{right}\\), the span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([\\tau + s(T - 17), h + s(T - 17)] = [25 + 6(T - 17), 36 + 6(T - 17)]\\).  \n  At \\(T = 17\\): span = \\([25 + 6(0), 36 + 6(0)] = [25, 36]\\).  \n  0 is not in \\([25, 36]\\), so no collision.\n- **Turn 18 (\\(y = 8\\), freeway 8)**:  \n  Freeway 8 has one car: \\((h = 36, \\tau = 25, d = \\text{right}, s = 6)\\).  \n  At \\(T = 18\\): span = \\([25 + 6(1), 36 + 6(1)] = [31, 42]\\).  \n  0 is not in \\([31, 42]\\), so no collision.\n\nAt turn 19, \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) actions with no collisions.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t=18. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=8 and need to get to y=9, we probably want to move up, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, about the cars: each freeway has cars with positions that move over time. The collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn, then collision occurs.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are only considered on y_T at turn T, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So, if they move to a new row, they don't check for collision on the new row until the next turn.\n\nWe need to find the sequence of actions from turn 18 onwards to reach y=9 quickly and safely.\n\nCurrent position: y=8 at t=18.\n\nTarget: y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9 because freeways are from y=1 to 8, so once we reach y=9, we're safe, and no cars to collide with. But we need to get there without colliding on the way.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\nFreeways 1 to 8 have cars. Let's list them clearly.\n\nFor freeway k=1: one car: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed 36. Since direction is left, it's moving left, so position decreases over time.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: same as k=1: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nk=3: three cars: (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nk=4: same as k=3: (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nk=5: one car: (42,31,right,6)\n\nk=6: one car: (42,31,right,6)\n\nk=7: one car: (42,31,right,6)\n\nk=8: one car: (42,31,right,6)\n\nFor k=3 and k=4, there are three cars each, but for k=5 to 8, only one car each with (42,31,right,6)\n\nNow, since the player is starting at y=8, and we need to go to y=9, which is above, so we might move up immediately, but we need to check if at t=18, on y=8, there is a collision.\n\nCollision occurs if 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's find the position of cars at turn t=18.\n\nt_1 = 18, so for any turn T, the time elapsed since t_1 is Δt = T - t_1 = T - 18.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)]\n\nSince it moves left, positions decrease.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it was [h, τ] at t_1, and since moving left, h and τ both decrease by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it says head h, tail τ, and span [h, τ] with h and τ, but when moving left, if h is the head and it's left-moving, head should be on the right, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"head at h, tail at τ\", and span [h, τ]. But if it's moving left, the head is the front, so for a left-moving car, head is on the right, tail on the left, so span [τ, h] if τ < h, or [h, τ] if h > τ? The notation says for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ], then at T, [h - s dt, τ - s dt].\n\nBut in the example, for k=1: h=-24, τ=11, so at t_1, span [ -24, 11 ]? That can't be right because -24 is less than 11, so [ -24, 11 ] means from -24 to 11, which is a length of 35, and speed 36, so it moves left, decreasing positions.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [τ, h] or something? For k=3: (42,31,right,6), it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No, the table says: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" but in the text it says for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s dt, h + s dt]\"\n\nIn the initial description: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state table, it lists (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving, it's [h, τ] at t_1, but with h and τ, for k=1, h=-24, τ=11, so [ -24, 11 ], which is from left to right? But it's moving left, so the head is at 11, tail at -24? I think there might be inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the span is always given with min and max.\n\nFor k=1: left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, so min is -24, max is 11, so span [ -24, 11 ].\n\nMoving left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, k=3: (42,31,right,6), h=42, τ=31, but τ=31, h=42, so min=31, max=42, span [31,42]? But the text says for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which for this would be [31,42], and moving right, so increases.\n\nIn the car, for right-moving, head should be on the left, tail on the right, but here τ=31, h=42, so τ < h, so head at 42, tail at 31, but moving right, so head at higher x.\n\nI think it's consistent: for any car, span [min, max] at t_1, and for left-moving, min and max decrease, for right-moving, min and max increase.\n\nIn collision, we care if 0 is in [min(T), max(T)] for any car on the freeway at turn T.\n\nFor freeway y, at turn T, if player is on y, and for some car on y, 0 in [car_min(T), car_max(T)], then collision.\n\nNow back to player at t=18, y=8.\n\nFirst, check if at t=18, on y=8, there is a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nFreeway y=8: one car: (42,31,right,6) so at t_1=18, span [31,42]? τ=31, h=42, and right-moving, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [31,42], so min=31, max=42 at t=18.\n\n0 is not between 31 and 42, so no collision at t=18 on y=8.\n\nPlayer can be here safely.\n\nNow, player wants to go to y=9. Since y=9 is the target and no cars, we can move up to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nAt turn T, player chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn T, player is at y_T, and we check collision based on y_T and the cars at turn T.\n\nIf at turn T, player is at y_T, and moves to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T, they are on y_T, so check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, they are on y_{T+1}, so check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, at t=18, y=8, no collision, as above.\n\nNow, if we do a_t = U, then y_{19} = y_{18} +1 = 8 +1 =9.\n\nThen at turn t=19, player is at y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, no collision, and we reached the target.\n\nBut is that possible? We need to make sure that during the move, no collision.\n\nAt turn t=18, we are on y=8, no issue.\n\nAction at t=18: if we choose U, then at turn t=18, we are still on y=8 when we perform the action, but after action, we move to y=9 for the next turn.\n\nThe collision check is only at the beginning of each turn, based on current position.\n\nAt turn T, before action, player is at position (0, y_T), and we check if that position collides with cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen, player chooses action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we start at (0, y_{T+1}), and check collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, at t=18: position (0,8), check cars on y=8 at t=18.\n\nAs above, car on y=8: span [31,42] at t=18, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen, if we choose a_{18} = U, then y_{19} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn t=19: position (0,9), now y=9, no cars, so no collision, and we are at target.\n\nSo in one action, we can reach.\n\nBut is y=9 a freeway? The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=9 is not a freeway, no cars, so definitely safe.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,8), which is on freeway 8, and target is (0,9), not on any freeway.\n\nIn the collision rule, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so when on y=1 to 8, need to avoid, but on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, moving up to y=9 should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nAt t=18, y=8: car span [31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAfter moving to y=9 at t=19, no cars, safe.\n\nSo minimal H=1, since from t=18 to t=19, one turn.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=18, after H turns, at t=18 + H, we reach.\n\nThe sequence is from t=18 to t=18 + H -1 actions.\n\nLet's see the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, y =9.\n\nIn this case, if we do one action at t=18, then at t=19, y=9, so H=2? Let's see.\n\nt_1 =18.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=18, y=8.\n\nAfter first action at t=18, at t=19, y=9 if a=U.\n\nSo to reach at t=19, which is t_1 +1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, so 18 + H -1 =19, thus H=2.\n\nH-1 =1, so one action.\n\nSequence: at t=18, action U.\n\nThen at t=19, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there any reason we cannot do this?\n\nPerhaps on other freeways, but since we are only on y=8 at t=18 and y=9 at t=19, no other rows involved.\n\nBut let's check if at t=18, on y=8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and car span is [31,42], which is far from 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, we don't care since we are not on them.\n\nBut for completeness, let's see the cars on other rows, but since we are not moving to them, no need.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we are at (0,8), so moving up should be direct.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider if moving up causes any issue, but in this case, no.\n\nMaybe the cars on y=8 at future turns, but since we move at t=18, we are only on y=8 at t=18, and at t=19 on y=9, so we don't care about y=8 at other times.\n\nSimilarly, for y=9, no cars.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: car (42,31,right,6) at t=18.\n\nDirection right, so moving right, speed 6.\n\nAt t=18, span [τ, h] = [31,42]? Earlier I said min=31, max=42.\n\nSince right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s dt, h + s dt] with dt = T - t_1.\n\nAt t=18, dt=0, span [31,42].\n\n0 not in.\n\nIf we stay, at t=19, dt=1, span [31 +6, 42+6] = [37,48], still not 0.\n\nBut we are not staying, we are moving.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for other rows, but we are not on them.\n\nBut in the sequence, only one action needed.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, which is freeway, and we move to y=9, not freeway.\n\nBut let me see if y=9 is reachable directly.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is vertical, and cars are on horizontal positions, but player is always at x=0, so we care only if car spans include x=0 at the turn we are on that row.\n\nIn this case, for y=8 at t=18, no car at x=0.\n\nSo action U at t=18 should be fine.\n\nBut let's look at the car states; there are multiple cars, but for y=8, only one car.\n\nSimilarly, for example, on y=7, there is a car, but we are not on y=7, so no need.\n\nBut perhaps to be thorough, let's see if there is any constraint.\n\nMaybe I should check if we can move to y=9 directly.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once there, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach it.\n\nPerhaps from y=8, moving up is the way.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,8), and target (0,9), so moving up.\n\nBut why is there information about other freeways? Maybe for other starting points, but here it seems simple.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: car (42,31,right,6)\n\nAt t=18: position min=31, max=42, since right-moving, at t_1, [31,42], and moving right, so at later times, min and max increase.\n\n0 is less than 31, so never in span, since min increases.\n\nSimilarly for other rows, but for example, y=7 has the same car: (42,31,right,6), similarly, min=31 at t=18, increasing, so 0 not covered.\n\nBut for y=3 and y=4, there are cars that might be near 0.\n\nFor example, y=3: cars (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAt t=18, for the second car: (6,-5,right,6), so head=6, tail=-5, right-moving, so span [τ,h] = [-5,6]? τ=-5, h=6, so min=-5, max=6.\n\nAt t=18, span [-5,6], so 0 is between -5 and 6? -5 <= 0 <= 6, yes, 0 is in [-5,6].\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, same cars, so at t=18, on y=3 and y=4, there is a car with span [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nSo if the player is on y=3 or y=4 at turn T where 0 is in some car span, collision.\n\nBut at t=18, we are on y=8, not on y=3 or y=4.\n\nIn our plan, we move directly to y=9, so we are only on y=8 at t=18 and y=9 at t=19, so no issue.\n\nBut just to note, if we were to go to lower rows, we need to be careful, but here we don't.\n\nPerhaps for moving up, but since we start at 8 and go to 9, no lower rows.\n\nAnother thing: the player can only move to adjacent y, so from 8, we can go to 7,8,9.\n\nBut we want to go to 9.\n\nIf for some reason we cannot go directly, but here we can.\n\nPerhaps at the moment we move, but no, collision is per turn based on position.\n\nSo I think moving up at t=18 is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the time.\n\nt_1=18, we need to output actions starting from t_1.\n\nSo action at t_1: U\n\nThen at t=19, y=9, done.\n\nH=2 turns: from t=18 to t=19, but turns are discrete, so at t=18 we are at start, after action at t=18, at t=19 we are at target.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut is H the number of turns including start or what?\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=18 to t=18 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at t=18 + H.\n\nSet t_1 + H -1 = time when y=9.\n\nAt time t_1 + H -1, position y=9.\n\nAt time t_1, we are at (0,8), not yet 9.\n\nAfter k actions, at time t_1 + k, we are at some y.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, at t=18 +0 =18, y=8.\n\nAfter one action at t=18, at t=19, y=9 if U.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =19, so 18 + H -1 =19, thus H=2.\n\nActions: from t=18 to t=18 + H -1 - t_1? Indices.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_{18}\n\nt=1, a_{19}, up to t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd after these actions, at time t_1 + H, y=9? Let's see.\n\nThe position after action.\n\nAt time T, before action, y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo at time T, we perform a_T, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt time t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut we start at t_1 with y_{t_1} =8.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nFor example, with one action: at t=18, a_18, then at t=19, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H =19, so H=1? Inconsistency.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, meaning actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, the position at time t_1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nAt time t_1, before any action, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,8).\n\nAfter action at t_1, position at time t_1 +1 is y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}.\n\nSimilarly, after action at t_1 + k, position at t_1 + k +1.\n\nSo after H actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1, the position at time t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd at that time, it should be safe, no collision, but since y=9, no cars.\n\nIn this case, to reach at t=19, which is t_1 +1, so t_1 + H =19, so H=1.\n\nThen actions: only one action at t=18, which is U.\n\nThen at t=19, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, for H=1, t from 0 to 0, so only a_{t_1 +0} = a_{18} = U.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H =19, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\" no.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet's see the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nt_1 + H -1 is the turn when y=9.\n\nAt that turn, we need no collision, so at turn t_1 + H -1, position (0,9), and since y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nNow, at time t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, at t_1 =18, if we want y_{18} =9, but y_{18}=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need to move.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is t=19.\n\nSo at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nt=19 = t_1 +1 =18 +1.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =19, so 18 + H -1 =19, thus H=2.\n\nThen actions from t=18 to t=18 + H -1 =18 +2-1=19? t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=2, t=0 to 1, so actions at t_1 +0 =18 and t_1 +1=19.\n\nBut at t=19, if we are at y=9, we don't need an action; we have reached.\n\nThe sequence includes actions up to the point before reaching.\n\nAfter the last action, at time t_1 + H, y=9? I think I have confusion.\n\nStandard: at time T, we are at y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nTo have y_K =9 for some K.\n\nK = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor K=19, t_1 + H -1 =19, so 18 + H -1 =19, H=2.\n\nThen actions at t=18 and t=19? But at t=19, if we are at y=9, we might not need to act, but the sequence includes actions to change position.\n\nWith H=2, actions at t=18 and t=19.\n\nAt t=18, we do a_18, which sets y_19.\n\nIf a_18=U, y_19=9.\n\nThen at t=19, we are at y=9, and we might do an action, but since we are already at target, we can do S or something, but we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is t=19 for H=2.\n\nAt turn t=19, we are at (0,9), so no need for further action, but the sequence has H actions, including up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor t=19, action at t=19, but if we do an action at t=19, it would change y_20, but we don't care, since we reached at t=19.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should only have necessary actions.\n\nWith one action at t=18, U, then at t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nSo we only need one action: at t=18.\n\nThen at turn t_19, y=9.\n\nSo the turn when we reach is t=19 = t_1 +1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nH=2, but only one action is needed.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=2, two actions: a_{18} and a_{19}.\n\nBut at t=19, we are already at y=9, so we can set a_{19}=S, for example.\n\nThen y_20 = y_19 +0 =9, still at target.\n\nBut we reached at t=19.\n\nIf we do a_{18}=U, then y_19=9, reached at t=19.\n\nThen for the sequence, we need to specify a_{19}, but since we are at target, S is fine, or any, but to be minimal, perhaps we can have H such that the last action brings us there.\n\nBut in the definition, the sequence has H actions, and after that, at time t_1 + H, y=9, but the reach is at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\" a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 \"\n\nAnd at that turn, no collision.\n\nIn this case, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith y_{18} =8, so we need to increase y.\n\nThe earliest possible is y_{19} =9.\n\nSo y_{19} =9, which is t_1 +1 =18+1=19.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =19, so 18 + H -1 =19, thus H=2.\n\nThen the actions are for t=0 to 1: a_{18} and a_{19}.\n\na_{18} must be U to set y_{19}=9.\n\nThen a_{19} can be S, U, or D, but since y=9, if we do U or D, we might go out of bound, but y must be in 0-9, so if y=9, U would try to go to 10, but y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or clamped, but in the update, it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9, U is invalid? But the action can be chosen, but if it would go out, it might stay or error, but the rule says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so probably the action is constrained, or y_{t+1} is clamped.\n\nLet's check the player update.\n\n\" y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t based on a_t, and y_{t+1} \\in [0,9] \"\n\nIt doesn't specify what happens if out of bound, but since it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], probably it is clamped, or action not possible.\n\nTo be safe, at y=9, only S or D, but D would go down, which we don't want.\n\nBut in this case, since we reach at t=19, and we need to specify a_{19}, we can set a_{19}=S, so y_{20}=9, but we are done at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence, we have to have H actions.\n\nSo for H=2, actions: at t=18: U, at t=19: S.\n\nThen at t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nIf we could have H=1, but y_{18} =8, not 9, so we cannot reach at t=18, so H must be at least 2.\n\nMinimal H=2.\n\nBut in terms of number of moves, only one move is needed, but due to the indexing, H=2.\n\nSimilarly, in the answer, we need to output two actions.\n\nBut for a_{19}, since we are at y=9, S is fine.\n\nNow, back to the car: is there any issue with moving at t=18?\n\nAt t=18, on y=8, no collision.\n\nAfter U, at t=19, on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut let's see if for other rows there are cars that might affect, but no.\n\nPerhaps the player could move down or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H=2 with actions U at t=18 and S at t=19.\n\nBut since at t=19 we are already at target, S is just a placeholder.\n\nWe could have only one action, but the indexing requires H=2.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, we can have only the necessary actions, but the definition says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} with y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for H=2, t from 0 to 1, actions at 18 and 19.\n\nNow, but in this case, it works.\n\nBut let's check if at t=18, on y=8, it is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 8: car with head 42, tail 31, right-moving, speed 6.\n\nAt t=18, span [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nThe car is moving right, so positions increasing, so min increases from 31, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFor example, y=7 has the same car, min=31, etc.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 have cars that cover 0 at t=18.\n\nSpecifically, on y=3, car (6,-5,right,6), at t=18, span [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly on y=4, same.\n\nBut since we are not on those rows, no problem.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the player could be forced to move if there is danger, but here no danger.\n\nSo the minimal sequence should be:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut at turn 19, action S, but we reached at turn 19, so S is just to satisfy the sequence length.\n\nSince y=9, we must do S or D, but D would go to 8, which is not desired, but after reaching, it might not matter, but to stay, S is fine.\n\nIn the action, for the last action, since we are at y=9, we can only choose S or D, but choosing D would move away, so S is the sensible choice.\n\nBut in terms of the problem, as long as at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, and no collision, which is true.\n\nWith a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9.\n\nThen a_{19}=S, y_{20}=9.\n\nBut we reached at t=19.\n\nSo for the answer, H=2, actions: a_{18}=U, a_{19}=S.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster, but no, since from 8 to 9 takes at least one move.\n\nIf we start at 9, but we start at 8.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if at other times, but we are not on other times.\n\nPerhaps for the move, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, when we move from y=8 to y=9 at turn T=18, at turn T=18, we are on y=8, not on y=9, so even if cars on y=9, but no cars, so fine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think it's straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps I should verify the car positions for y=8 at t=18.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car (42,31,right,6)\n\nAt t=18, dt=0, span [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=19, if we were there, span [37,48], not 0.\n\nBut we move away.\n\nSimilarly, for example, on y=6, same car, etc.\n\nBut all good.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nH=2\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut in the box.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\n}\n\nFor H=2, it should be two lines.\n\nBut let's see the sequence index.\n\nt_1 =18, H=2, so actions at t=18 and t=19.\n\na_{18} and a_{19}.\n\nWith a_{18}=U, a_{19}=S.\n\nBut a_{19}=S is not necessary, but we have to include it.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different action, but U then S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the problem, there are multiple cars on some rows, but for y=8, only one.\n\nBut let's list all cars to be sure.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, so at t=18, span [ -24, 11 ], moving left, so positions decrease, min and max decrease.\n\n0 is in [ -24,11 ]? -24 <= 0 <=11, yes, 0 is in the span at t=18.\n\nBut freeway y=1, at t=18, if player on y=1, collision, but player is on y=8, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as 1, at t=18, span [-24,11], includes 0.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\nFirst: (42,31,right,6) span [31,42] at t=18, 0 not in\n\nSecond: (6,-5,right,6) span [-5,6] at t=18, 0 in\n\nThird: (-30,-41,right,6) span [-41,-30] at t=18, 0 not in (since -41 to -30, 0 > -30? -30 <= 0? -30 <=0 is true, but 0 <= -30? No, 0 > -30, so 0 not in [-41,-30], since -41 <= x <= -30, so x <= -30 <0, so 0 not in.\n\nOnly if min <=0<=max.\n\nFor second car, min=-5, max=6, -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as 3.\n\nFreeway 5: one car (42,31,right,6) span [31,42], 0 not in\n\nFreeway 6: same, [31,42]\n\nFreeway 7: same, [31,42]\n\nFreeway 8: same, [31,42]\n\nSo at t=18, on y=1,2,3,4, there are cars covering x=0, but player on y=8, safe.\n\nThen moving to y=9, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is to move up at turn 18.\n\nSo in the answer.\n\nBut H=2, with two actions.\n\nPerhaps we can output only the necessary, but the format requires the sequence for H turns.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: S }\n\nBut in the box, it should be written as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\netc.\n\nWith t_1=18.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S }\n\nBut since it's minimal, and we reached at turn 19.\n\nIf we do a_{18}=U, then at turn 19, we are at y=9, and no need for a_{19}, but the sequence must have H actions, so we include a_{19}=S.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nPerhaps for the last turn, since we reached, we can choose any action, but S is safest.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn \\(t = 18\\), the player is at \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway \\(y = 8\\) has a span of \\([31, 42]\\) at \\(t = 18\\), which does not include \\(x = 0\\), so no collision occurs.\n- Choosing action \\(U\\) at \\(t = 18\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 19\\).\n- At \\(t = 19\\), the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars (as freeways are only from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision occurs, and the target is reached.\n- Since the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 19\\), which is \\(t_1 + 1 = 18 + 1\\), we have \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 19\\), so \\(H = 2\\).\n- The sequence requires \\(H = 2\\) actions: one at \\(t = 18\\) to move to \\(y = 9\\), and one at \\(t = 19\\) (where the player is already at the target). At \\(t = 19\\), action \\(S\\) is chosen to stay at \\(y = 9\\), as \\(U\\) or \\(D\\) would be invalid or unnecessary (and \\(y\\) must remain in \\([0, 9]\\)).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 2\\) turns.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- At turn 18, action \\(U\\) moves the player from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 19, action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\), maintaining the position.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S }",
