        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn t1 = 0.\n\nThe grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: only one segment at (3,3). That means the snake is just the head right now, since it's a list with one position. So length is 1.\n\nSnake head direction is left, so it's facing L (x-1).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,1) with life span 10 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,3) with life span 10 and value +1\n\n- (3,1) with life span 10 and value +1\n\nAll food has life span 10, meaning they'll disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n\nSince the snake is at (3,3) and direction is L, if it moves left, it would go to (2,3). But (2,3) has food! Let me check the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (3,3)\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but since direction is L, I can't instantly reverse to R. So possible moves are U, D, L.\n\n- U (up): (3,3) to (3,4)\n\n- D (down): (3,3) to (3,2)\n\n- L (left): (3,3) to (2,3)\n\n- R (right): not possible because it would be opposite direction.\n\nNow, (2,3) has food, as per the list: (2,3,10,1) meaning position (2,3), life 10, value +1.\n\nAlso, (2,1) and (3,1) have food.\n\nBut the snake is at (3,3), so moving to (2,3) would eat the food there, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut the snake has only one segment, so after eating, it should grow to length 2. Let me confirm the rules.\n\nPositive food: reward +1, length +1.\n\nNegative food: penalty -1, length unchanged.\n\nHere all food is positive, value +1.\n\nAlso, since the snake is length 1, eating food will make it length 2, with head and tail at the same position initially? No.\n\nSnake positions are given as a list. Currently [(3,3)], so head at (3,3), no body.\n\nWhen it eats food, the length increases, so the tail stays or something? Rule says: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nBut in terms of movement, when snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added. If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nStandard snake mechanics.\n\nHere, since length is 1, if it eats food, after moving, head is at new position, and tail is added at previous position, I think. But since it was only one segment, after eating, there will be two segments: head at new position, and tail at old position.\n\nFor example, if snake moves from (3,3) to (2,3) and eats food, then new positions: head at (2,3), and tail at (3,3). So snake becomes [(2,3), (3,3)].\n\nThen direction would be L, since it moved left.\n\nBut direction is updated based on movement.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nCurrent grid: let me sketch mentally.\n\nGrid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake at (3,3).\n\nFood at:\n\n- (2,1) - let's call F1\n\n- (2,3) - F2, which is directly left of snake.\n\n- (3,1) - F3\n\nAll with life 10.\n\nSince life span decreases every turn, including current, so after this turn, life span becomes 9 for all, and so on.\n\nBut at turn 0, life is 10.\n\nNow, possible actions at turn 0: U, D, L (since R is reverse, not allowed).\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I eat F2, which is positive, so score +1, length becomes 2.\n\nThen snake positions: head at (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nDirection now L.\n\nBut after eating, the tail is at (3,3), so the body is there.\n\nNow, from there, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut let's consider other options.\n\nMove U to (3,4): no food there, so snake moves, but since no food, length remains 1, but head moves to (3,4), and tail? Since length 1, after moving, head is at (3,4), no tail, so snake is just at (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (3,2), head to (3,2), no food, so snake alone at (3,2).\n\nIf move L to (2,3), eat food, snake becomes [(2,3), (3,3)].\n\nNow, I need to maximize score and survive long-term.\n\nAlso, there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, since snake is length 1, no tail yet, so no such risk now.\n\nAfter eating, there is a tail.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nFirst, if I don't eat now, the food might disappear later, but life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut I should consider the board.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles.\n\n(3,1) has food, which is down-left, but from (3,3), down is (3,2), then to (3,1) or something.\n\nLet me list all cells.\n\nFirst, let's find safe moves.\n\nFor turn 0, moving to (2,3) seems good because I get food immediately.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nIf I eat at (2,3), I become length 2, with body at (3,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move U, D, L, R? Direction is L, so I came from right, so moving right would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction L, so previous position was (3,3), which is to the right.\n\nSo possible moves: from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), or R to (3,3). But R to (3,3) is where the tail is, but in snake, moving to tail is allowed because tail will move away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (3,3) is safe if it's the tail.\n\nCurrently, if I moved to (2,3), tail is at (3,3), so from (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is possible, and since tail is there, it will move, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, other directions.\n\nBut let's not jump ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to choose for turn 0.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Move L to (2,3): eat food, score +1, length 2, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\n2. Move U to (3,4): no food, length 1, positions [(3,4)], direction U (since moved up)\n\n3. Move D to (3,2): no food, length 1, positions [(3,2)], direction D\n\nNow, which one is better?\n\nIf I move U or D, I don't eat, but I can go towards other food.\n\nFor example, food at (2,1) and (3,1) are both at y=1.\n\n(3,1) is directly below (3,3), since y decreases down? Coordinates: y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n\nIn the state, walls: y=0 and y=7, with y=0 probably bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo (3,3) to (3,1) is down, y from 3 to 1, decreasing.\n\nFrom (3,3), to reach (3,1), I can move D to (3,2), then D to (3,1), but (3,2) has no food, so I can move to (3,2) now, then next turn to (3,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) can be reached via (2,2) or (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) has food now.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (5,6), which is far away, not relevant now.\n\nNow, thinking long-term.\n\nIf I eat at (2,3) now, I get +1, but I have a body at (3,3), which might block me later.\n\nSince the grid is small, 8x8, with walls, and snake grows, it might get cramped.\n\nBut now length 1, so I have space.\n\nFood life span 10, so I have time to eat them.\n\nBut if I don't eat now, the food might be eaten later or I might miss it.\n\nSince I'm the only snake, and no other agents, the food will stay until eaten or expired.\n\nSo I can plan to eat them.\n\nBut let's consider the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (2,3), I have snake at [(2,3), (3,3)].\n\nThen, if I move away, say to (2,4) or (1,3), etc., the tail will move next turn when I move.\n\nSuppose I move from (2,3) to (2,4) (U), then head to (2,4), and since I didn't eat food (assuming no food at (2,4)), the tail moves from (3,3) to (2,3)? No.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed from the end. If food eaten, tail stays, new head position, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (2,3), positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nNow, if I move head to, say, (2,4) and there is no food there, then head moves to (2,4), tail is removed, so snake becomes just [(2,4)], length 1 again.\n\nIf there is food at (2,4), then head to (2,4), tail stays at (3,3)? Let's clarify.\n\nStandard: when snake moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the new cell has food, it is eaten, snake grows: head at new cell, body segments remain, so the last segment (tail) stays, and new segment added at head old position? No.\n\nTypically: the head moves to the new position. If food eaten, a new body segment is added at the position where the head was before moving. So the tail doesn't move.\n\nIf no food, the tail moves forward, meaning the last segment is removed.\n\nSo for length 1: head at position A.\n\nMove to B: if B has food, then new head at B, and new tail at A, so positions [B, A], length 2.\n\nIf no food, head moves to B, no tail, so positions [B], length 1.\n\nSimilarly, for length 2: positions [H, T], head H, tail T.\n\nMove head to new position N.\n\nIf N has food, then new positions [N, H], and tail T remains, so [N, H, T]? No.\n\n[ H, T ] means head at H, tail at T.\n\nAfter moving head to N:\n\n- If food at N, then head is now at N, and a new segment is added where head was, so body becomes [H, T], but with head moved, so positions: [N, H], and T is still there? No.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nBetter to think of the list: positions list [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] where P0 is head, Pk is tail.\n\nWhen moving, head moves to new position N, so new head is N.\n\nThen, if food eaten, the tail remains, so new positions [N, P0, P1, ..., Pk]\n\nIf no food eaten, the tail is removed, so new positions [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}]\n\nFor k=0, only head, P0.\n\nMove to N: if food, [N, P0] ; if no food, [N]\n\nFor k=1, [P0, P1]\n\nMove to N: if food, [N, P0, P1] ; if no food, [N, P0] (since tail P1 removed)\n\nIn the no food case, [N, P0] means head at N, tail at P0.\n\nIn food case, head at N, body at P0, tail at P1.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nAt turn 0, snake at [(3,3)]\n\nIf move L to (2,3) and eat food: new positions [(2,3), (3,3)] with head at (2,3), tail at (3,3)\n\nDirection now L.\n\nIf move U to (3,4) no food: new positions [(3,4)]\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options for turn 0.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3) - eat food, score +1, length 2, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nThen for turn 1, from (2,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3)\n\nR to (3,3) is the tail cell, but it's safe because tail will move.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), and there is no food there (currently no food at (3,3)), so if I move to (3,3), head moves to (3,3), and since no food (assuming), the tail which was at (3,3) moves? Tail is at (3,3), head moving to (3,3) would be same cell, but in movement, when head moves to a cell, if it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves away after.\n\nBut the cell is occupied by tail, so moving to it is allowed only if it's the tail, and after move, tail is no longer there.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to tail cell, and no food, then head moves there, tail is removed, so effectively the snake shortens or something? No.\n\nExample: positions [H, T] with H and T different or same? In this case, after eating, H at (2,3), T at (3,3), different cells.\n\nIf I move head to (3,3), which is T.\n\nThen head moves to (3,3). Since the cell (3,3) has no food (in this case), then after head moves to (3,3), the tail is removed, so new positions are just [(3,3)] because head at (3,3), and tail was removed, so length 1 again.\n\nIf there was food at (3,3), but there isn't.\n\nSo moving to tail cell with no food causes the snake to effectively not grow and the tail is absorbed or something, but length decreases by 1? In this case from length 2 to 1.\n\nBut in terms of positions, it becomes head at (3,3), no body.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food at tail cell, it might be dangerous, but let's see.\n\nIn this case, for turn 1, if I move to (3,3), no food, so snake becomes [(3,3)] again, length 1, and I lost the food I ate, net effect same as not eating, but I did get +1 score when I ate at turn 0.\n\nBut at turn 1, I'm back to start.\n\nBut I have the score.\n\nThen I can eat again.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nOther moves from (2,3): U to (2,4), no food, so after move, head to (2,4), tail removed, so snake [(2,4)], length 1.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,2), no food, snake [(2,2)]\n\nL to (1,3), no food, snake [(1,3)]\n\nR to (3,3), as above, snake [(3,3)]\n\nSo after eating at (2,3) and then moving to any adjacent with no food, I lose the body and back to length 1.\n\nIf I move to a cell with food, I can grow more.\n\nBut currently, no food near except the existing ones.\n\nFood at (2,1), (3,1), and (2,3) is eaten.\n\n(2,3) is eaten at turn 0, so it's gone.\n\nRemaining food: (2,1) and (3,1)\n\nBoth at y=1.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I move D to (2,2), no food, so snake to (2,2), length 1.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move to (2,1) to eat food, or other directions.\n\nBut let's not get into details yet.\n\nFirst, back to turn 0 choices.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4) at turn 0: no food, snake to [(3,4)], direction U.\n\nThen I can go towards other food, like (3,1) or (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (3,2): no food, snake to [(3,2)], direction D.\n\nThen (3,1) is directly below, so I can move D again to (3,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), but (3,3) was previous, or to other cells.\n\nBut let's think about the food life span.\n\nAll food has life span 10, so at turn 0, life 10, after turn 0, if not eaten, life 9, and so on.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to eat multiple food.\n\nAlso, avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (5,6) is not blocking now.\n\nAnother thing: the grid is small, 8x8, so with walls, playable area is 6x6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are free, except obstacle at (5,6).\n\nx from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6, similarly y:1 to 6.\n\nx=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(1,1) to (6,6), but (5,6) has obstacle, so not free.\n\nCells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6; except (5,6) is obstacle.\n\nSo 6x6=36 cells minus 1, 35 free cells.\n\nSnake at (3,3), which is centerish.\n\nFood at (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is left of (3,3).\n\n(3,1) is below (3,3), (2,1) is below-left.\n\nNow, if I move L to (2,3) at turn 0, I eat (2,3), score +1, length 2.\n\nThen for turn 1, as above, if I move to a cell with no food, I lose the body, back to length 1.\n\nBut there is food at (2,1) and (3,1), so I could move towards them.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), move D to (2,2) no food, so snake becomes [(2,2)], length 1, direction D.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) to eat the food there at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2) I could move L to (1,2) or R to (3,2), but to eat food at (2,1).\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 0: L to (2,3) - eat (2,3), score +1, snake [(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 1: D to (2,2) - no food, so tail removed, snake [(2,2)], direction D\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,1) - eat (2,1), score +1, snake [(2,1),(2,2)]  (after eating, head at (2,1), body at (2,2))\n\nLength 2.\n\nThen I can go to (3,1) or other.\n\nFrom (2,1), food at (3,1) is at (3,1), which is right and same y? (2,1) to (3,1) is R.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIf at turn 0 I move D to (3,2) instead.\n\nTurn 0: D to (3,2) - no food, snake [(3,2)], direction D\n\nTurn 1: D to (3,1) - eat (3,1), score +1, snake [(3,1),(3,2)] length 2\n\nThen I can go to (2,1) or other.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is left from (3,1), so move L to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 1, after eating at (3,1), snake at [(3,1),(3,2)]\n\nThen turn 2: move L to (2,1) - but (2,1) has food, so eat it, score +1, snake grows: head to (2,1), body at (3,1), tail at (3,2)? Positions: after move to (2,1), food eaten, so new positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] head at (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nLength 3.\n\nSimilarly, in the first sequence, after eating (2,1) at turn 2, I can move to (3,1).\n\nBut in both cases, I can eat two food quickly.\n\nBut in the first option, I eat (2,3) at turn 0, then (2,1) at turn 2.\n\nIn second, eat (3,1) at turn 1, then (2,1) at turn 2.\n\nTurn 0: if move L, eat at turn 0; if move D, eat at turn 1 at (3,1).\n\n(2,3) is eaten at turn 0 if I move L.\n\nIf I move D at turn 0, I don't eat (2,3), so it remains.\n\nThen I can eat (3,1) at turn 1, then (2,1) at turn 2, and (2,3) is still there, I can go back to eat it.\n\nBut (2,3) at (2,3), from (2,1) I need to go up to (2,2) or something.\n\nLet's compare scores.\n\nOption A: Move L at turn 0\n- Turn 0: eat (2,3), score=1, length=2\n- Turn 1: move to (2,2) no food, snake length=1 at (2,2)\n- Turn 2: move to (2,1) eat food, score=2, length=2 at [(2,1),(2,2)]\n\nThen I can move to (3,1) or other.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move R to (3,1) to eat, but (3,1) has food, so turn 3: move R to (3,1) eat, score=3, snake [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] head at (3,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nBut (2,2) is tail.\n\nThen I have eaten all three food by turn 3.\n\nTurn 0: eat (2,3)\nTurn 2: eat (2,1)\nTurn 3: eat (3,1)\n\nAt turn 1, I moved to (2,2) no eat.\n\nSo scores at turn 0,2,3.\n\nIf I move D at turn 0:\n- Turn 0: move D to (3,2) no eat, score=0, length=1 at (3,2)\n- Turn 1: move D to (3,1) eat, score=1, length=2 at [(3,1),(3,2)]\n- Turn 2: move L to (2,1) eat, score=2, length=3 at [(2,1),(3,1),(3,2)]\n\nThen (2,3) is still there, I can go to eat it.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move U to (2,2) no food, then to (2,3) eat.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (2,2) no eat, so tail removed, snake to [(2,2), (2,1)]? Positions: head at (2,2), no food, so tail removed. Previous positions [(2,1),(3,1),(3,2)], head (2,1), tail (3,2)\n\nMove head to (2,2), no food, so new positions: head at (2,2), and since no food, tail removed, so body segments: the first body segment becomes the new tail? From list [P0,P1,P2] = [H, B, T] = [(2,1),(3,1),(3,2)]\n\nMove head to N=(2,2), no food, so new head N, and remove tail, so new positions [ (2,2), (2,1) ] because P0 is kept as body, tail P2 removed.\n\nSo [ (2,2), (2,1) ] head at (2,2), tail at (2,1)\n\nLength 2.\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (2,3) eat, score=3, snake [ (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) ] head (2,3), body (2,2), tail (2,1)\n\nSo I eat (2,3) at turn 4.\n\nCompared to first sequence where I ate all by turn 3.\n\nIn first sequence with move L at turn 0, I ate (2,3) at t0, (2,1) at t2, (3,1) at t3.\n\nIn second with move D at t0, I ate (3,1) at t1, (2,1) at t2, (2,3) at t4.\n\nSo in first, I have score 3 by t3, in second score 3 by t4.\n\nAlso, in first, at t3 I have length 3, in second at t2 I have length 3, but by t4 same.\n\nBut I need to think about risks and long-term.\n\nIn both cases, I eat all food, but in the first approach, I ate (2,3) earlier.\n\nBut there is a risk with Tail Reward Danger.\n\nFor example, when I have body segments.\n\nIn the first sequence after eating (2,3) at t0, I have snake [(2,3),(3,3)], then I move to (2,2), no eat, so back to length 1, no issue.\n\nThen eat (2,1), have [(2,1),(2,2)], then move to (3,1), eat, have [(3,1),(2,1),(2,2)]\n\nNow, from here, I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), or L to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, or R to (4,1), etc.\n\n(2,1) is body, so moving to (2,1) would collide unless it's the tail.\n\nTail is at (2,2), so (2,1) is body, not tail, so moving to (2,1) would be body collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, in other positions.\n\nBut from (3,1), head, body at (2,1), tail at (2,2).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, L to (2,1) body, collision, R to (4,1), or since direction? After moving to (3,1) from left? At turn 2, from (2,1) to (3,1) right, so direction R.\n\nThen turn 3, head at (3,1), direction R.\n\nCannot move L to (2,1) because opposite direction and also body.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) invalid (wall), R to (4,1)\n\nSo only U or R.\n\n(3,2) is free, no food or anything.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) free.\n\nNow, no immediate danger.\n\nBut long-term, I need to survive and find more food, but there is no more food listed, only three food.\n\nThe state has only three food, and after eating them, no more, so I need to survive as long as possible without food? But the goal is to maximize score, so with no food, score doesn't increase, but I should avoid death to keep the score.\n\nSince no more food, I can just move around safely.\n\nBut with length 3, in 6x6 grid minus obstacle, 35 cells, so plenty of space.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead for the initial move.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nAnother option: move U at turn 0 to (3,4).\n\nThen snake at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen I can go down to eat food, but food are at y=1, so I need to go down.\n\nFor example, turn 0: U to (3,4) no eat\n\nTurn 1: D to (3,3) but (3,3) is previous position, or to (3,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,1), from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), no food, snake to (3,3), then D to (3,2) no, then D to (3,1) eat.\n\nBut at turn 0, (3,3) had snake, but after moving, it's empty.\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3), move U to (3,4), so (3,3) empty now.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), move D to (3,3) no food, snake to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 2: move D to (3,2) no food, snake to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3: move D to (3,1) eat, score+1, snake [(3,1),(3,2)] length 2\n\nThen I can eat (2,1) or (2,3)\n\nBut (2,3) might have less life, but life span 10, at turn 3, life left 7 for all food.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (2,1) from (3,1) by moving L to (2,1) eat, then to (2,3).\n\nBut this is slower: I eat first food at turn 3, whereas in previous sequences I ate at turn 0 or 1.\n\nSo moving away from food seems inefficient for score.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0, moving L or D is better to eat food soon.\n\nMoving U is worse because it delays eating.\n\nSimilarly, moving L eats immediately.\n\nBut moving L to (2,3) might have a risk if I stay near, but in this case, no.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) is directly accessible, and if I don't eat it, I can eat it later, but since life span is long, no urgency.\n\nBut to maximize score early, eating now is fine.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I can grow and eat others.\n\nBut in the case where I move L at turn 0, I eat one food, then after moving away, I lose the length, so I don't keep the length, but I have the score.\n\nThe score is what matters, not the length, but length allows me to eat more without shrinking, but with positive food, eating grows, so longer snake can block more, but in open space, it's ok.\n\nIn this small grid, with length 3, it's manageable.\n\nBut for now, at turn 0, I think moving L to eat (2,3) is good.\n\nBut let's consider the Tail Reward Danger for future.\n\nFor example, if I have a situation where head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this state, no food under snake, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but here not.\n\nIn the food list, all food are at free cells, not under snake.\n\n(2,1), (2,3), (3,1), snake at (3,3), so all free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0, I should move L to eat the food.\n\nBut the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", and \"think 5+ turns ahead\".\n\nSo let's outline a 5-turn plan.\n\nAssume I move L at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3) - eat food, score+1, snake [(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 1: from (2,3), I need to choose move.\n\nPossible: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut R to (3,3) is tail, moving there with no food would make snake length 1 at (3,3), which is not progress.\n\nMoving to other cells with no food also reduces length.\n\nBut I can move towards other food.\n\nFor example, move D to (2,2) no food, so snake becomes [(2,2)], length 1, direction D.\n\nThen turn 2: move D to (2,1) eat food at (2,1), score+1, snake [(2,1),(2,2)] length 2, direction D? After moving to (2,1) from (2,2) down? From (2,2) to (2,1) is D, y decreasing.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,1), I can move R to (3,1) to eat the food there, but (3,1) has food.\n\nMove R to (3,1) eat, score+1, snake [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] head (3,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), or R to (4,1), since D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) body, collision.\n\nSay move U to (3,2) no food, so snake moves: head to (3,2), no food, so tail removed, new positions [ (3,2), (2,1) ] because remove tail (2,2), so head (3,2), body (2,1) but (2,1) is the only body, tail was (2,2), removed, so new positions [ (3,2), (2,1) ]? List: previous [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ], head (3,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nMove head to (3,2), no food, so new head (3,2), and remove tail (2,2), so body segments: (3,1) becomes body, (2,1) is still there? New positions: the body is [ (3,1), (2,1) ] but with head at (3,2), so [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ]? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, the body segments shift.\n\nAfter move, head at new position, then the previous head becomes first body, and so on, tail removed if no food.\n\nSpecifically: positions before move: [P0, P1, P2] = [H, B, T]\n\nAfter move to N, no food: new positions [N, P0, P1] but P1 was B, and T is removed? Standard: the new positions are [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] for k segments.\n\nIn this case, k=2 body segments? Positions list: index 0: head, 1: body, 2: tail.\n\nLength 3, so 3 positions.\n\nAfter moving head to N, no food eaten, new positions: head at N, and the tail position is removed, so the new body is from P0 to P_{k-1}, but P0 becomes the new first body segment.\n\nNew positions: [N, P0, P1] but P1 was the tail? For length 3: [P0, P1, P2] with P0 head, P1 body, P2 tail.\n\nAfter move to N, no food: new head N, then P0 becomes body, P1 becomes tail, P2 removed. So new positions [N, P0, P1]\n\nIn this case, [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ]? Previous [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ]\n\nP0=(3,1), P1=(2,1), P2=(2,2)\n\nMove head to N=(3,2), no food, so new positions: head N=(3,2), then P0=(3,1) becomes body, P1=(2,1) becomes tail, P2 removed. So [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ]\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), and (3,1) at (3,1), etc.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to other cells.\n\nBut in this sequence, by turn 3 I have eaten all food, score 3.\n\nNow, if at turn 1, after turn 0, instead of moving D, I could move directly to other food, but from (2,3), to reach (3,1), I need to go down, but (2,2) is empty, etc.\n\nNot direct.\n\nI could move L to (1,3) at turn 1, but no food, so snake to [(1,3)], then I need to come back, slower.\n\nSo the sequence above is fine.\n\nIf at turn 0 I move D to (3,2) no eat, then turn 1 to (3,1) eat, etc., as before, but I eat later.\n\nSo moving L at turn 0 seems best to get early score.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=0, so I need actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4 at least.\n\nIn the sequence with move L at turn 0, I have:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nThen turn 1: I need to choose, say D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,1) eat\n\nTurn 3: R to (3,1) eat\n\nThen turn 4: I need to move, say U to (3,2) or something.\n\nBut after turn 3, all food eaten, so turn 4 can be any safe move.\n\nSimilarly, in the other sequence.\n\nBut to be consistent, I should plan 5 turns.\n\nSince I have to output actions, I need to specify.\n\nBut for turn 0, moving L seems good.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) might be riskier if I have body, but since I eat and then move away, it should be fine.\n\nMoreover, the rule about food under body: but here no food under body initially.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 0 is fine.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan to eat the remaining food.\n\nFood at (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nFrom turn 0 after eating (2,3), snake at [(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nAt turn 1, I can move D to (2,2) to go towards (2,1).\n\nAs above.\n\nI could move directly to (2,1) but not adjacent; from (2,3) to (2,1) is two steps down, not direct.\n\nSo move D to (2,2) first.\n\nThen turn 2 to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1) to (3,1) at turn 3.\n\nThen for turn 4, from (3,1), move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly, I need to output actions.\n\nBut the output should be for the turns starting from t1=0.\n\nSo let's define a sequence.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3) - eat (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) - no food, snake length 1 at (2,2)\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,1) - eat (2,1), snake [(2,1),(2,2)] length 2\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1) - eat (3,1), snake [(3,1),(2,1),(2,2)] length 3\n\nNow turn 4: from (3,1), head at (3,1), direction R (since moved right from (2,1))\n\nCannot move L to (2,1) because body and opposite.\n\nCan move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1) or D to (3,0) invalid.\n\nSo move U to (3,2) no food.\n\nAfter move, head to (3,2), no food, so tail removed: previous positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ], move to (3,2), new positions: head (3,2), then (3,1) becomes body, (2,1) becomes tail? As before: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ]\n\nTail at (2,1).\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,2), can move to (3,3), (4,2), (3,1) but (3,1) is tail, or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for 5 turns, I have up to turn 4 action.\n\nt1=0, so turns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nActions: turn 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 4 action is move U to (3,2).\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nSince after eating all, I can move safely.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, I should consider if there are risks.\n\nFor example, after turn 3, snake at (3,1) with body at (2,1) and tail at (2,2), moving U to (3,2) is safe.\n\nThen from there, no issues.\n\nIf at turn 1 I moved differently, but this seems fine.\n\nAnother option: at turn 1, from (2,3), I could move to (1,3) or other, but that delays eating other food, so not better.\n\nTherefore, I think moving L at turn 0 is the best.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 2: D (to (2,1))\n\nTurn 3: R (to (3,1))\n\nTurn 4: U (to (3,2))\n\nIn turn 4, moving U to (3,2) is one option.\n\nI could move R to (4,1), but (4,1) is free, no issue.\n\nBut U is fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAlso, need to box the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 1, I moved D to (2,2), no food, so length 1, but I could have moved in a way to keep the length, but there is no food nearby, so I have to move to empty cells, so length decreases.\n\nUnless I find food immediately, but no.\n\nSo it's inevitable.\n\nThus, I think this plan is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating positive food while avoiding collisions and considering the grid constraints. The current state (turn \\(t_1 = 0\\)) has the snake at position (3,3) with direction left (L), and three positive food items at (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), each with a life span of 10. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n### Key Considerations for the 5-Turn Plan:\n- **Immediate Food Access**: Moving left (L) on turn 0 eats the food at (2,3), gaining +1 score and increasing snake length to 2. This is optimal as it secures an early reward without significant risk.\n- **Path to Remaining Food**: After eating (2,3), the next targets are (2,1) and (3,1). Moving down (D) on turns 1 and 2 positions the snake to eat (2,1) efficiently. Then, moving right (R) on turn 3 eats (3,1).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No negative food is present, so all food is safe to eat if reached.\n  - The snake starts at length 1, so Tail Reward Danger (where eating food adjacent to the tail causes collision) is not a risk initially. After growth, movements are planned to avoid body collisions (e.g., on turn 3, moving right to (3,1) avoids the body segment at (2,1)).\n  - Wall and obstacle collisions are avoided by staying within x=1-6 and y=1-6, and steering clear of (5,6).\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has a life span of 10, which decreases to 9 after turn 0. The plan eats all food by turn 3, well before expiration (turn 10).\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus**: After eating all food by turn 3, the priority shifts to safe movement to avoid collisions. On turn 4, moving up (U) to (3,2) is a conservative choice that keeps the snake centered and away from walls, with multiple escape routes for future turns. The grid has ample space (35 free cells), and the snake length is manageable (3) for evasion.\n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake direction is tracked to prevent illegal reverse moves (e.g., after moving L on turn 0, reverse to R is blocked on turn 1; similarly for other turns).\n\n### 5-Turn Action Plan:\n1. **Turn 0 (Current Turn)**: Move L to (2,3) to eat the positive food there. This gains +1 score and increases length to 2. Snake positions: [(2,3), (3,3)].\n2. **Turn 1**: Move D to (2,2). No food here, so the tail segment is removed, reducing length back to 1. This positions the snake closer to (2,1). Snake positions: [(2,2)].\n3. **Turn 2**: Move D to (2,1) to eat the positive food. This gains +1 score and increases length to 2. Snake positions: [(2,1), (2,2)].\n4. **Turn 3**: Move R to (3,1) to eat the positive food. This gains +1 score and increases length to 3. Snake positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)].\n5. **Turn 4**: Move U to (3,2). No food here, so the tail segment is removed (snake length reduces to 2). This is a safe move that avoids walls and the body segment at (2,1), while centering the snake for future exploration. Snake positions: [(3,2), (3,1)].\n\n### Outcome After 5 Turns:\n- **Score**: +3 (all food eaten by turn 3).\n- **Snake Length**: 2 (after turn 4, due to no food eaten on turns 1 and 4).\n- **Food Status**: All food consumed; none remain.\n- **Survival**: No collisions or risks encountered; the snake is in a safe position at (3,2) with open moves (e.g., U to (3,3), R to (4,2), or L to (2,2) on future turns).\n\nThis plan maximizes early scoring, efficiently uses the food life spans, and ensures safety by avoiding high-risk areas. Beyond turn 4, the snake can continue moving safely in the open grid to survive indefinitely, as no more food is available.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L \\\\\nTurn 1: D \\\\\nTurn 2: D \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's 8 cells wide and 8 cells tall. Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,2), then body at (2,3). Since the head is at (2,2) and direction is down, that means the snake is moving downwards. Direction D means down, so from (2,2) to (2,3) is down, since y increases as we go up? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The walls are given as x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, but it doesn't specify which is top or bottom. However, since head direction is down from (2,2) to (2,3), and y=3 is below y=2 if we assume y=0 is bottom, but let's think.\n\nIf direction is down and it moved from previous position to current, but I don't have previous state. Current positions are [(2,2), (2,3)], head first. So head is at (2,2), and the next segment is at (2,3). Since direction is down, that means moving down increases y or decreases y?\n\nIf head is at (2,2) and moving down to (2,3), that suggests that y increases as we go up, because (2,3) has a higher y than (2,2), so if moving down, y should decrease. There's inconsistency.\n\nDirection D (down) means the snake is facing downwards. So if it moves down, y should decrease if y=0 is the top. But let's see the positions: head at (2,2), body at (2,3). Since the body is behind the head, and direction is down, that means the head was previously at a higher y and moved down to (2,2), leaving the body at (2,3). But I need to know the movement.\n\nPerhaps I should assume a standard coordinate system. In many grid games, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, x increases right.\n\nIf (0,0) is top-left, then moving down increases y, moving right increases x.\n\nSo head at (2,2), direction down, so it was moving down to (2,2), and the previous position was, say, (2,1), but current positions are [(2,2), (2,3)], so head is (2,2), body is (2,3). If direction is down and y increases down, then from (2,2) to (2,3) is moving down? But (2,3) has higher y, so if y increases down, (2,3) is below (2,2), so moving from head to tail, it's going down to (2,3), which means the snake is vertical, head at (2,2), tail at (2,3), so it's facing downwards.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So coordinate system: (0,0) top-left, y increases downward, x increases right.\n\nSo:\n\n- Moving Up: y decreases\n\n- Moving Down: y increases\n\n- Moving Left: x decreases\n\n- Moving Right: x increases\n\nHead direction is D, down, so moving down increases y.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,2)\n\nBody position: (2,3) — that's the tail.\n\nSnake length is 2 segments.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 8\n\n- (3,1) with value 1, life span 8\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (2,1), life span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn? Current turn is t=2, so it will disappear at turn t=2 + 8 = 10? Let's see.\n\nLife span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so it lasts from turn t to turn t + N - 1? I need to clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if food has life_span N, then after N turns, it disappears. Countdown decreases each turn, starting from N down to 1, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears? Or after N turns meaning it exists for N turns.\n\nLet's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the turn it spawns, countdown is N, and each turn it decreases, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten as long as countdown > 0.\n\nFor example, turn t=2, food at (2,1) has life_span 8, so countdown=8 at turn 2. After turn 2, countdown=7, and so on, until countdown=0 after some turn, then it disappears.\n\nThe food exists when countdown >=1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCurrent turn t=2.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life span 8, so available from t=2 to t=9? At t=2, countdown=8; after t=2, countdown=7; ... at t=9, countdown=1; after t=9, countdown=0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 2 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): value 1, life span 8, same as above.\n\n(1,1): value 1, life span 9, so countdown=9 at t=2, disappears after t=10 (countdown=0 after t=10).\n\nNow, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders, meaning we cannot move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (5,6), so cannot move there.\n\nSnake head at (2,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up, because no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on this turn. Possible moves: down, left, right.\n\nNow, let's see the grid around.\n\nHead at (2,2). Moving:\n\n- Down: to (2,3), but (2,3) is currently occupied by the tail. But rule: I can move to the tail cell because the tail will move away. Only if I eat food, the tail doesn't move, but in this case, moving to (2,3) is possible, but (2,3) is the tail, and since I'm not eating food there, when I move to (2,3), the tail will move forward, so I don't collide.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell that is the tail, and I don't eat food, then the snake moves, tail moves away, so no collision. Collision only if head touches any body segment except the tail when it's about to move.\n\nBut here, the body has only one segment, which is the tail at (2,3). So moving to (2,3) is safe because it will become the new head, and the old tail will be removed or something? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position. If no food eaten, tail is removed. If food eaten, tail not removed, so length increases.\n\nPositions: current snake: head (2,2), body/tail (2,3).\n\nIf I move down to (2,3), that's where the tail is. Since I'm moving to (2,3), and (2,3) is the current tail, but after movement, the head will be at (2,3), and since I didn't eat food, the tail (which was at (2,3)) is removed, and the new tail is the previous head position? No.\n\nLet's clarify movement:\n\n- The head moves to a new cell.\n\n- If that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail remains, and we add the new head position. Length increases by one.\n\n- If no food, the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward, length same.\n\nIn this case, if I move head to (2,3), which is the current tail position.\n\nSince I'm moving to a cell that has the tail, and if I don't eat food there, then after moving, the head is at (2,3), and the old tail at (2,3) is now the head, but the tail cell is vacated, so the body segment that was at (2,3) is now gone? I'm getting confused.\n\nBetter to think of the snake as a list of positions.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (2,2), (2,3) ]  // head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)\n\nNow, if I move down to (2,3), but (2,3) is already occupied by the tail.\n\nWhen I move the head to a new position:\n\n- The new head position is (2,3)\n\n- Since I moved to (2,3), and (2,3) is not food (no food mentioned at (2,3), only at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)), so I don't eat food.\n\nTherefore, no growth, so the tail is removed. The tail was at (2,3), so it is removed, and the new snake becomes [ (2,3) ], but that can't be right because I have only one segment now? No.\n\nThe body: the segment that was head becomes body, and tail is removed.\n\nAfter moving head to new position, the old head becomes part of body, and the tail is popped off if no growth.\n\nSo here: move head to (2,3). New head position: (2,3)\n\nBut (2,3) was the tail, so now the snake positions: the new head is at (2,3), and the body is... the previous head (2,2) becomes the body, and since no growth, the old tail (2,3) is removed, but (2,3) is the new head, so it's messy.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: the cell (2,3) is occupied by the tail. When the head moves to (2,3), since it's the tail, and no food, it's allowed, and after move, the head is at (2,3), and the tail was removed, so the only segment is (2,3), but the body was (2,2), which is now the tail? Let's list.\n\nInitial: segment 0 (head): (2,2), segment 1 (tail): (2,3)\n\nAfter move down to (2,3):\n- New head position: (2,3)\n- Since no food eaten, we remove the tail segment, which was (2,3). But (2,3) is now the head, so we remove the old tail, which was at (2,3), but that cell is now the head, so effectively, the snake has only one segment at (2,3)? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a misconception.\n\nIn snake, when you move to a cell that was the tail, and no food, the tail moves away, so the head takes the tail position, and the snake shortens to the new position with the body moving.\n\nStandard: positions [head, body, ..., tail]\n\nWhen moving to a new cell:\n- New head position\n- If new cell has food, keep all segments, add new head, length +1\n- If no food, remove the tail segment, add new head, so the body segments shift.\n\nIn this case, moving to (2,3) which is the current tail:\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Since no food, remove the tail segment. The tail segment is (2,3), so we remove it, but (2,3) is the new head, so we are removing the new head? Conflict.\n\nThe key point is that the tail cell is only occupied temporarily; when the head moves to it, it's fine because the tail is leaving that cell.\n\nIn terms of collision: the snake collides if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail cell, because the tail will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for this case, moving to (2,3) is allowed because it's the tail, and after move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving down to (2,3):\n- New head at (2,3)\n- Since no food, the old tail at (2,3) is removed? But it's the same cell.\n\nThe tail segment is at (2,3). When we add new head at (2,3), and remove the tail segment, we are removing the segment that was at (2,3), so the new positions are: the body segment that was at (2,2) is now the tail, and new head at (2,3).\n\nInitial positions: [ (2,2) , (2,3) ]  index 0: head, index 1: tail\n\nAfter moving down to (2,3):\n- New head at (2,3)\n- Since no food, we remove the last segment (the tail), which was (2,3)\n- So new positions: [ (2,3) ]  only one segment? But that can't be, because the old head (2,2) should be part of the body.\n\nI think the indices: when we add new head, the list becomes [new_head, old_head, ... , but when no growth, we remove the last element.\n\nSo initial: [ A, B ] where A=(2,2), B=(2,3)\n\nMove to (2,3): new_head = (2,3)\n\nNew list: [ new_head, old_head ] = [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and since no food, we remove the last element, which is old_head? No, last element is tail.\n\nOld list: positions[0] = head, positions[1] = tail\n\nAfter move:\n- Prepend new_head to the list: [ new_head, positions[0], positions[1], ... ] but that's not how it works.\n\nStandard way: the new head position is added to the front of the list.\n\nIf no food, the last element (tail) is removed.\n\nIf food, last element not removed.\n\nSo here: new head at (2,3)\n\nNew list: [ (2,3) , (2,2) , (2,3) ]? No.\n\nPositions list: initially [ (2,2), (2,3) ]  // head first\n\nNew head position: (2,3)\n\nSo new positions: [ (2,3) , (2,2) ]  // (2,3) is new head, (2,2) is now the body/tail.\n\nThen, since no food eaten, we remove the last element, which is (2,2), so new snake is just [ (2,3) ], a single segment at (2,3).\n\nBut that means the snake has shortened to length 1, which is incorrect because we didn't eat food, length should remain 2.\n\nI think I have it wrong.\n\nPerhaps for a snake of length L, when moving without eating, the tail is removed, so the new snake has the new head and the first L-1 body segments, but the last body segment becomes the new tail.\n\nInitial: segments S0, S1, with S0 head, S1 tail.\n\nMove to new cell C.\n\nNew head at C.\n\nIf C has food, new positions: [C, S0, S1]  // length +1\n\nIf no food, new positions: [C, S0]  // S1 is removed, so tail is now S0\n\nIn this case, moving to (2,3): C = (2,3)\n\nNo food, so new positions: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]  // (2,3) is new head, (2,2) is new tail.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the snake is now at [ (2,3), (2,2) ], with head at (2,3), tail at (2,2), and it has turned around or something.\n\nBut in terms of position, it's fine, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten food, it would be [ (2,3), (2,2), (2,3) ] but (2,3) is duplicate, but only if food at (2,3), which there isn't.\n\nBack to the game.\n\nFor current state, head at (2,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down, left, right. Cannot move up (reverse).\n\nNow, let's see what happens for each move.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,3): as above, new head at (2,3), new tail at (2,2). No food eaten, so length still 2.\n\nThen, the new direction would be down, since I moved down.\n\nBut (2,3) is within bounds, not wall, and no obstacle.\n\nFood is at (2,1), (3,1), (1,1), all at y=1, which is above, since y=0 is top, y=1 is below y=0, but y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the row below top.\n\nGrid: y=0 top row, y=1 below, up to y=7 bottom.\n\nSo food at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) are all at row y=1.\n\nHead at (2,2), so moving down to (2,3) is away from food.\n\nSecond option: move left to (1,2)\n\n(1,2): is it valid? x=1, y=2, not wall, not obstacle. Food? No food at (1,2), food at (1,1) but different cell.\n\nSo move left to (1,2): new head at (1,2), new tail at (2,3)? Positions: new head (1,2), old head (2,2) becomes body, tail (2,3) removed if no food, so new positions: [ (1,2), (2,2) ], head at (1,2), tail at (2,2).\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nNew direction left.\n\nThird option: move right to (3,2)\n\n(3,2): valid cell, no food, so new head (3,2), new tail at (2,2), positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ].\n\nNew direction right.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score.\n\nCurrent turn t=2.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (2,1): life span 8, so can be eaten from t=2 to t=9\n\n- (3,1): similarly t=2 to t=9\n\n- (1,1): life span 9, t=2 to t=10\n\nAll value +1.\n\nSince the snake is short, length 2, eating food increases length to 3, which might make it harder to manuever, but we need to eat to score.\n\nBut also, with longer snake, more body to avoid.\n\nBut the grid is 8x8, so space is limited.\n\nNow, the food is all near (x,1), which is close to the top wall at y=0.\n\nHead at (2,2), so I can reach the food in one move if I go up, but I cannot go up because current direction is down, and no instant reverse. So on this turn, I cannot move up.\n\nSo to eat food, I need to go to (2,1), (3,1), or (1,1), but from (2,2), moving left to (1,2) or right to (3,2) or down to (2,3).\n\nNone of these moves directly eat food; the food is at (2,1), which is above (2,2), but I can't move up now.\n\nSo on turn t=2, I cannot eat food immediately; I need to set up for future turns.\n\nAlso, after moving, on next turn, I might be able to move up.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (1,2), then from there, I can move up to (1,1) to eat the food, since direction would be left, and up is not opposite to left (opposite of left is right, not up).\n\nDirections: if I move left to (1,2), new direction is left.\n\nThen on next turn, I can move up, down, or left, but not right (reverse).\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (3,2), new direction right, then can move up, down, right.\n\nIf I move down to (2,3), new direction down, then can move down, left, right.\n\nNow, to eat food at (1,1), (2,1), or (3,1), I need to get to those cells.\n\n(2,1) is directly above (2,2), but I can't move up now.\n\n(1,1) is above and left of (2,2), (3,1) above and right.\n\nFrom (2,2), if I move left to (1,2), then I can move up to (1,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (3,2), then move up to (3,1) to eat.\n\nIf I move down to (2,3), I am farther away.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with tail reward danger, but currently the snake is short, no issue.\n\nNow, life span: the food has life span 8 or 9, and current turn 2, so they will disappear at t=10 for (2,1) and (3,1), t=11 for (1,1)? Let's calculate disappearance.\n\nFood at (2,1): life span 8 at t=2, so after 8 turns, it disappears. Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn t, countdown = life_span - (t - t_spawn) or something.\n\nSpawned at some turn, but here at t=2, we have the food with life span, so for (2,1), at t=2, countdown=8.\n\nAfter turn t=2, countdown=7 (assuming after the turn it decreases).\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nBut when does it decrease? At the end of the turn or beginning?\n\nFor simplicity, assume that at the start of turn t, food has countdown C, and if the snake moves to it during the turn, it is eaten. At the end of the turn, countdown decreases by 1.\n\nIf countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (2,1) at t=2: countdown=8\n\nAfter t=2, countdown=7, and so on.\n\nIt can be eaten on turns when countdown >=1, so from t=2 to t=9, since at t=9, countdown=1, eaten, then after decrease to 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) same.\n\n(1,1) life span 9, at t=2 countdown=9, eaten t=2 to t=10, gone after t=10.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe output should be for turns starting from t=2, then t=3, etc., for at least 5 turns, but since it's a sequence, I need to decide the action for each turn up to when I eat or something.\n\nThe answer format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so for t=2, t=3, t=4, t=5, t=6, and perhaps beyond.\n\nBut I should think strategically.\n\nFirst, I should consider eating one of the food items soon.\n\nOptions:\n\n- If I move left to (1,2) on turn t=2, then on t=3, I can move up to (1,1) to eat the food there.\n\n- Similarly, if I move right to (3,2) on t=2, then t=3 move up to (3,1) to eat.\n\n- If I move down to (2,3) on t=2, then I am at (2,3), and I can move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3) or down to (2,4), but to reach food, I need to go back up, which might take more turns.\n\nMoving down seems inefficient for eating food soon.\n\nBut I have to avoid risks, and think long-term.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, and I need to survive.\n\nMoreover, there might be opportunities to eat multiple food.\n\nBut currently only three food, all at y=1.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is far, not immediate concern.\n\nWalls at borders.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid:\n\ny=0: wall\n\ny=1: cells (0,1) wall? x=0 is wall, so (0,1) is invalid, similarly (7,1) invalid. Valid x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls, x=0 and x=7 walls. But y=0 is top wall, so y from 1 to 6 are playable? y=0 wall, y=1 is first row, y=6 is row above y=7 wall. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x from 1 to 6. Similarly y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo playable area: 6x6 grid from (1,1) to (6,6), except internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is within, so cells to avoid: walls at x=0,7 or y=0,7, and (5,6).\n\nNow, food at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), all at top row y=1.\n\nSnake at (2,2) and (2,3).\n\nIf I move left to (1,2) on t=2:\n\n- t=2 action: L (left) to (1,2)\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), tail (2,2) — after move, since no food, new snake [ (1,2), (2,2) ], head at (1,2), direction left.\n\nNow turn t=3: from (1,2), I can move up to (1,1), which has food. Since I move to (1,1), and it has food, I eat it.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (1,1), and since food eaten, no tail removal, so positions: [ (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ], length 3.\n\nNew direction up.\n\nFood at (1,1) is eaten, so removed.\n\nRemaining food: (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nLife span: (2,1) countdown at t=3: since at t=2 it was 8, after t=2 decreased to 7, at start t=3 countdown=7? Let's track.\n\nAt t=2, for (2,1): countdown=8\n\nAfter snake move on t=2, countdown decreases to 7.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt t=3, (2,1) countdown=7, (3,1) countdown=7, (1,1) countdown=9 at t=2, after t=2 decreased to 8 at start t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, if I eat (1,1), it is consumed.\n\nNow, after eating, snake at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), head at (1,1), direction up.\n\nFrom here, I can move to eat other food.\n\nFor example, (2,1) is adjacent at right.\n\nBut (2,1) is to the right of (1,1), so I can move right to (2,1).\n\nBut is that safe? Tail is at (2,2), which is below (2,1)? Positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (2,2).\n\n(2,1) is at (x=2,y=1), which is not occupied by body; body is at (1,2) and (2,2), so (2,1) is empty except for food.\n\nSo moving right to (2,1) should be fine.\n\nBut after moving, if I eat (2,1), snake grows to length 4.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to t=2 decision.\n\nIf on t=2 I move left to (1,2), then t=3 move up to (1,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if on t=2 I move right to (3,2), then t=3 move up to (3,1) to eat (3,1).\n\nIf I move down on t=2 to (2,3), then at (2,3), I can on t=3 move, say, left to (1,3) or right to (3,3), but to reach food, I need to go to y=1.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I move up to (2,2), but (2,2) is where the tail was, but after move on t=2 to (2,3), new positions [ (2,3), (2,2) ], head at (2,3), tail at (2,2).\n\nOn t=3, I can move up to (2,2), which is the current tail position.\n\nMoving to (2,2) is allowed since it's tail.\n\nThen new head at (2,2), and since no food (food not at (2,2)), tail removed, so new positions [ (2,2) ]? Length 1? No.\n\nAfter move to (2,2): new head (2,2), old head (2,3) becomes body, tail (2,2) removed? Positions: old [ (2,3), (2,2) ], move up to (2,2), new head (2,2), then new list [ (2,2), (2,3) ], then since no food, remove tail, which is (2,3), so new snake [ (2,2) ] only, length 1.\n\nBut that means the snake shortened, which is not desirable for scoring, and we lose the body.\n\nIn terms of game, moving to the tail cell without eating food causes the snake to shorten, which might be bad if we want to grow.\n\nIn this case, from (2,3) moving to (2,2) which is tail, no food, so new snake just [ (2,2) ], length 1.\n\nThen from there, I can move to eat food, but I lost a segment.\n\nSince we want to maximize score, shortening is bad because we need to eat to grow, not shrink.\n\nSo moving to the tail cell without food should be avoided if possible, as it reduces length unnecessarily.\n\nIn this case, from (2,3), moving up to (2,2) is bad because it shortens the snake.\n\nBetter to move left or right or down.\n\nFor example, move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3) or down to (2,4).\n\nBut then to reach food, it takes more moves.\n\nFor instance, from (2,3) move left to (1,3) on t=3, then to (1,2) on t=4, then to (1,1) on t=5 to eat, but by t=5, food might have less life, but still available.\n\nBut compared to moving left on t=2 to (1,2), then t=3 eat at (1,1), I eat on t=3, earlier.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nSo moving down on t=2 delays eating.\n\nMoreover, moving down might go towards the bottom, where there is no food, and I have to come back.\n\nBut the food is at top, so better to stay near top.\n\nTherefore, on t=2, I should not move down; instead, move left or right to set up for eating food on t=3.\n\nNow, which one? (1,1), (2,1), or (3,1).\n\n(2,1) is directly above, but I can't reach it directly from (2,2) because I can't move up.\n\nIf I move to (1,2) or (3,2), I can eat the corner food.\n\n(1,1) and (3,1) are corners, (2,1) is center.\n\nAfter eating, if I eat (1,1), I am at corner, which might be riskier for movement, but with length 3, it might be ok.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1).\n\nIf I eat (2,1), it might be more central.\n\nBut I need to get to (2,1) first.\n\nHow can I eat (2,1)?\n\nFrom current position (2,2), I can't move up on t=2.\n\nIf I move left to (1,2) on t=2, then on t=3, instead of moving up to (1,1), I could move right to (2,2), but (2,2) is where the tail is.\n\nAfter t=2 move left to (1,2), positions [ (1,2), (2,2) ], head (1,2), tail (2,2).\n\nOn t=3, if I move right to (2,2), which is tail, and no food, so new head (2,2), then new positions [ (2,2), (1,2) ], then remove tail (1,2), so new snake [ (2,2) ], shortened to length 1. Bad.\n\nSo I should not move to tail unless eating food there.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move up to (1,1) or down to (1,3) or left, but left is x=0, wall, cannot move left from (1,2) since x=1, moving left would be to (0,2), which is x=0 wall, invalid, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at (1,2), possible moves: up to (1,1), down to (1,3), right to (2,2).\n\nBut moving right to (2,2) is to tail, no food, causes shortening, so not good.\n\nMoving down to (1,3) moves away from food.\n\nSo best to move up to (1,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nTo eat (2,1), I need to be at (2,2) and move up, but I can't on t=2.\n\nSo I must be at (2,2) with direction allowing up on the next turn.\n\nCurrently direction is down, so after moving, if I move to a position where direction changes, I can move up on t=3.\n\nFor example, if on t=2 I move left to (1,2), direction left, then on t=3 I can move up, but not to (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom (1,2), moving up to (1,1), not to (2,1).\n\nTo reach (2,1), I need to be at (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1) or (2,0) but y=0 wall.\n\nOr from (3,2), etc.\n\nSo the only way to eat (2,1) is to have the head at (2,2) and move up to (2,1).\n\nBut on t=2, I am at (2,2), but I cannot move up because direction down, reverse not allowed.\n\nOn t=3, I can move up if the new direction allows.\n\nFor that, on t=2, I need to move in a way that after move, I am at (2,2) or adjacent with direction not down? No.\n\nAfter t=2 move, the head is not at (2,2) anymore.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (1,2) on t=2, head at (1,2).\n\nThen on t=3, I am not at (2,2), so I cannot move to (2,1) directly.\n\nThe only way is to have the head back at (2,2) on some turn with direction not down, so I can move up.\n\nBut to get back to (2,2), it might take turns.\n\nFor instance, from (1,2), I could move down to (1,3), then right to (2,3), then up to (2,2), but that takes multiple turns, and when I reach (2,2), I might be able to move up if direction allows.\n\nBut it's inefficient.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can consider moving to (3,2) or (1,2) and eat the corner food first.\n\nThen later go for (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) might be eaten by then? No, only me playing.\n\nSo no competition.\n\nBut life span, (2,1) disappears after t=9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner is better to free up space or something, but not critical.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating any is good.\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, which might block paths.\n\nFor example, if I eat (1,1) on t=3, snake at (1,1),(1,2),(2,2), head (1,1).\n\nThen I can move right to (2,1) to eat, if available.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is adjacent right.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can move right to (2,1), since direction is up (from eating (1,1)), moving right is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nThen eat (2,1), snake grows to [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ], length 4.\n\nHead at (2,1), direction right.\n\nThen I can move down to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by the tail? Positions: after eating (2,1), new head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), tail (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is tail.\n\nMoving down to (2,2): since (2,2) is tail, and if I move there, no food (assuming no food at (2,2)), so I would shorten the snake, which is bad.\n\nMoving to (2,2) would be moving to tail, no food, so head moves to (2,2), tail removed, so new positions [ (2,2), (1,1), (1,2) ], then remove tail (1,2)? After moving to (2,2), new head (2,2), body segments (1,1) and (1,2), tail (2,2) but removed, so new snake [ (2,2), (1,1) ], length 2, shortened.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move down to (2,2) only if I eat food there, but no food.\n\nOr move left, but left is (1,1), occupied by body.\n\nMoving left to (1,1): but (1,1) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision, die.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nMoving right to (3,1), which has food.\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves: up: (2,0) wall, invalid.\n\nDown: (2,2), occupied by tail, can move but no food, causes shortening.\n\nLeft: (1,1), occupied by body, collision.\n\nRight: (3,1), which has food, so can move there to eat.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen after eating, snake longer.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nBack to t=2 decision.\n\nIf I move left on t=2 to (1,2), then t=3 move up to (1,1) eat.\n\nThen snake at [ (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ], head (1,1), direction up.\n\nThen on t=4, from (1,1), I can only move right to (2,1) to eat (2,1), since other directions invalid.\n\nMove right to (2,1), eat, then new head (2,1), and grow, positions [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ], head (2,1), direction right.\n\nThen on t=5, from (2,1), I can move right to (3,1) to eat (3,1), since (3,1) has food.\n\nMove to (3,1), eat, positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ], head (3,1), direction right.\n\nThen on t=6, from (3,1), possible moves: up (3,0) wall, invalid; down to (3,2); left to (2,1) but (2,1) occupied by body, collision; right to (4,1) or (4,1) if within bounds.\n\nx=3,y=1, move down to (3,2), or right to (4,1), or left invalid.\n\nLeft to (2,1) is body, die.\n\nSo move down to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n\nBut no food there, so need to explore.\n\nBut I have eaten all three food by t=5, score +3.\n\nIf on t=2 I move right to (3,2), then t=3 move up to (3,1) eat (3,1).\n\nThen snake [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)? After move to (3,2) on t=2, positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ], head (3,2), tail (2,2).\n\nt=3 move up to (3,1), eat, so new positions [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ], head (3,1), direction up.\n\nThen t=4, from (3,1), can move left to (2,1) to eat (2,1), or down to (3,2) but (3,2) body, collision, or right to (4,1), or up wall.\n\nSo move left to (2,1) eat.\n\nThen positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ], head (2,1), direction left.\n\nThen t=5, from (2,1), can move down to (2,2) but (2,2) tail, no food, move there would shorten; or left to (1,1) to eat; or up wall; right to (3,1) body, collision.\n\nSo move left to (1,1) eat, if available.\n\n(1,1) is there, life span 9, so at t=5, still available.\n\nMove to (1,1) eat, positions [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ], etc.\n\nSimilar score.\n\nIf I move down on t=2, it takes longer.\n\nFor example, t=2 move down to (2,3), positions [ (2,3), (2,2) ], head (2,3), direction down.\n\nt=3, move left to (1,3), for example, positions [ (1,3), (2,3) ], head (1,3), tail (2,3)? After move, new head (1,3), old head (2,3) body, tail (2,2) removed, so [ (1,3), (2,3) ], head (1,3), direction left.\n\nt=4, move up to (1,2), positions [ (1,2), (1,3) ], head (1,2), tail (1,3)? New head (1,2), old head (1,3) body, tail (2,3) removed, so [ (1,2), (1,3) ], head (1,2), direction up.\n\nt=5, move up to (1,1) eat, positions [ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ], etc.\n\nThen I eat on t=5, later than t=3.\n\nAnd I haven't eaten others yet.\n\nSo better to eat sooner.\n\nTherefore, on t=2, I should move left or right to eat corner food on t=3.\n\nNow, which one? (1,1) or (3,1).\n\n(1,1) has longer life span (9 vs 8 for others), but all will be eaten soon, so not critical.\n\nBut (1,1) life span 9, (2,1) and (3,1) life span 8, so (2,1) and (3,1) disappear sooner.\n\nAt t=2, (2,1) countdown=8, disappears after t=9, so can be eaten until t=9.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) until t=10.\n\nIf I move to eat (3,1) first, then (2,1), then (1,1), all can be eaten.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I eat (1,1) last, it might be after t=10? No, t=5 or so.\n\nIn first sequence, if I start with (1,1) on t=3, eat (2,1) on t=4, (3,1) on t=5, all by t=5, well before t=9 or 10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (5,6) is not near, so no issue.\n\nAlso, after eating all, I need to survive, but with no food, I can just move around.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so I should eat all available food.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: but here, when I eat, the tail is not adjacent in a way that causes problem.\n\nFor example, when I eat (2,1) from (1,1), tail is at (2,2), not adjacent to head at (1,1), so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo both left and right are symmetric, but since the obstacle is at (5,6), which is bottom-right, but not relevant now.\n\nI could choose to eat (2,1) later, but it might be riskier.\n\nBut with the above, I can eat all three quickly.\n\nPerhaps I should output a sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t=2.\n\nLet's define the actions.\n\nOption 1: t=2 move L (left) to (1,2)\n\nThen t=3 move U (up) to (1,1) eat\n\nThen t=4 move R (right) to (2,1) eat\n\nThen t=5 move R (right) to (3,1) eat\n\nThen t=6 from (3,1), move D (down) to (3,2) or R to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut after t=5, all food eaten, so no need to specify, but I should provide 5 actions or so.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with right.\n\nBut in the sequence above, when I move from (1,1) to (2,1) on t=4, that's fine.\n\nOn t=5 from (2,1) to (3,1), also fine.\n\nNow, after that, snake is longer.\n\nBut for the answer, I think providing actions until I eat or for 5 turns is fine.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but here with the food available, eating them is good.\n\nIf I move down, I might miss the food if I don't go back in time, but life span is long, so I can.\n\nBut eating sooner allows me to potentially find more food, but no more food is given, only these three.\n\nThe state has only these food, no mention of new food spawning, so probably only these food to eat.\n\nSo maximizing score means eating all three.\n\nWith moving left or right on t=2, I can eat all by t=5.\n\nWith moving down, I eat later, say on t=5 for one, then need more turns for others.\n\nFor example, if t=2 move D to (2,3)\n\nt=3 move L to (1,3)\n\nt=4 move U to (1,2)\n\nt=5 move U to (1,1) eat\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,1) on t=6, but (2,1) might be gone if life span short, but at t=6, (2,1) countdown: at t=2 cd=8, t=3 cd=7, t=4 cd=6, t=5 cd=5, t=6 cd=4, so still available.\n\nThen eat (2,1) on t=6, etc., but I eat later, and snake shorter for some time, but score same, but since I eat all, score +3 same.\n\nBut in the first approach, I eat earlier, so I have longer snake sooner, which might help if there were more food, but there isn't.\n\nAlso, with longer snake, I might be at risk, but here grid is small, but with length 5, it might be tight, but manageable.\n\nIn the first sequence, after eating three, length 5.\n\nBut the grid has 36 cells, obstacle, so 35 free, snake length 5, plenty space.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, better to eat sooner.\n\nNow, between moving left or right on t=2.\n\n(1,1) has life span 9, others 8, but since I eat all early, not critical.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (5,6) might affect if I go there, but not now.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nLet's choose to move left on t=2.\n\nThen actions:\n\nt=2: L (left)\n\nt=3: U (up) to eat (1,1)\n\nt=4: R (right) to eat (2,1)\n\nt=5: R (right) to eat (3,1)\n\nThen on t=6, from (3,1), head, after eating (3,1), positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) ], head (3,1), direction right.\n\nNow, possible moves: up: (3,0) wall, invalid; down: (3,2); left: (2,1) body, collision; right: (4,1)\n\nSo can move down to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n\nSay, move down to (3,2) to go away from wall.\n\nBut no food, so it doesn't matter.\n\nSince I need to provide actions, I can stop after t=5 or provide more.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action ...\" for several turns.\n\nSince t1=2, I should provide actions for t=2 to t=6 or so.\n\nBut after t=5, all food eaten, so actions are just for survival.\n\nBut let's define.\n\nIn the sequence above, on t=4, when I move from (1,1) to (2,1), is (2,1) free? Yes, and I eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in t=4, moving to (2,1), which was not eaten yet.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat (2,1) on t=4, from (1,1), moving right to (2,1), direction was up (from t=3), now moving right, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for t=2, action L.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction change.\n\nCurrent direction D (down).\n\nMove L (left), which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nNew direction left.\n\nThen t=3 move U (up), perpendicular to left, allowed.\n\nNew direction up.\n\nThen t=4 move R (right), opposite to left? Direction history.\n\nAfter t=3, head at (1,1), direction is up (since moved up from (1,2)).\n\nMoving right to (2,1), which is perpendicular to up, so allowed, not reverse.\n\nReverse of up is down, not right.\n\nSo ok.\n\nThen t=5 move R to (3,1), from (2,1), direction right (since moved right), moving right again is same direction, allowed.\n\nThen eat.\n\nNow, for t=6, I need to move, say, down to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n\nBut to think long-term, after eating, I should avoid walls and body.\n\nFor example, move down to (3,2).\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut since no more food, survival is easy.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved right first on t=2.\n\nBut I think left is fine.\n\nTo avoid the obstacle later, but (5,6) is far.\n\nSo I'll go with moving left.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: L (left)\n\nTurn 3: U (up)\n\nTurn 4: R (right)\n\nTurn 5: R (right)\n\nNow, for turn 6, from (3,1), after t=5, head at (3,1), direction right.\n\nMove D (down) to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,2), can move L, D, R, etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, providing until turn 6 is fine, or up to turn 7.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so from t=2, think ahead to t=7 or beyond.\n\nBut in output, provide the actions.\n\nSince after t=5, no food, actions are arbitrary as long as safe.\n\nSo for the sequence, I can provide:\n\nTurn 2: L\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: D  (down to (3,2))\n\nTurn 7: for example, move L to (2,2) but (2,2) is body? After t=6 move to (3,2), let's track positions.\n\nAfter t=5: snake positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\nt=6 move D to (3,2): new head (3,2), since no food, tail removed, so tail was (2,2), removed, new positions: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) ], head (3,2), direction down.\n\nt=7, from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, collision; D to (3,3); L to (2,2) but (2,2) not occupied? Body positions: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), so (2,2) is free? Yes.\n\n(2,2) is not in positions, so free.\n\nx=2,y=2, not in snake, so can move left to (2,2).\n\nOr down to (3,3), or right to (4,2).\n\nSay, move left to (2,2).\n\nThen new head (2,2), no food, so remove tail, tail was (1,2), so new positions [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) ], etc.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond.\n\nFor the answer, I think actions for t=2 to t=6 should be sufficient, showing the eating sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, on t=4, I eat (2,1), which has life span 8, at t=4, countdown=8 - (4-2) = 6? At t=2 cd=8, after t=2 cd=7, t=3 cd=6, at t=4 start cd=5, so cd=5>0, ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think this is good.\n\nBut in the beginning, I have three food, all positive.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving to (2,3) is better for long-term, but I think not.\n\nAnother point: the food at (2,1) is under the body? No, current snake at (2,2) and (2,3), food at (2,1) is not under body, it's separate.\n\nOnly if food under body, but not here.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating all available positive food while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves moving towards the food at (1,1) first, as it has the longest life span (9 turns), and then sequentially eating the remaining food at (2,1) and (3,1). This approach allows the snake to consume all food by turn 5, scoring +3, and avoids unnecessary risks by staying near the top of the grid where the food is located. Moving down on turn 2 is inefficient, as it delays eating and risks missing the food with shorter life spans. The sequence below ensures the snake eats all food safely and then moves away from the walls to open space for survival.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current Direction (Down)**: On turn 2, the snake cannot move up (reverse), so left or right is chosen to set up for eating on turn 3.\n- **Food Life Spans**: \n  - (2,1) and (3,1) disappear after turn 9 (countdown 8 at turn 2, decreases each turn).\n  - (1,1) disappears after turn 10 (countdown 9 at turn 2).\n  - Eating all by turn 5 is well within life spans.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Moving to the tail cell is safe when no food is eaten (tail moves away).\n  - After eating, the snake grows, so movements are planned to avoid body collisions.\n- **Grid Constraints**: \n  - Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,6) are avoided.\n  - Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6 except (5,6).\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 2-7):\n1. **Turn 2 (t=2)**: Move left (L) to (1,2).  \n   - Why: Sets up to eat (1,1) on the next turn. Avoids moving down (inefficient) or up (reverse not allowed). New head at (1,2), direction left. Snake: [(1,2), (2,2)].\n\n2. **Turn 3 (t=3)**: Move up (U) to (1,1) to eat the food.  \n   - Why: Eats (1,1) (value +1), increasing length to 3. New head at (1,1), direction up. Snake: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2)].\n\n3. **Turn 4 (t=4)**: Move right (R) to (2,1) to eat the food.  \n   - Why: Eats (2,1) (value +1), increasing length to 4. From (1,1), moving right is valid (not reverse; previous direction up). New head at (2,1), direction right. Snake: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)].\n\n4. **Turn 5 (t=5)**: Move right (R) to (3,1) to eat the food.  \n   - Why: Eats (3,1) (value +1), increasing length to 5. From (2,1), moving right is valid (same direction). New head at (3,1), direction right. Snake: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]. All food eaten; score maximized at +3.\n\n5. **Turn 6 (t=6)**: Move down (D) to (3,2).  \n   - Why: After eating, move away from the top wall to open space for survival. From (3,1), moving down is safe (no body or wall; (3,2) is free). New head at (3,2), direction down. Snake: [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)] (tail at (1,2) removed; no food eaten).\n\n6. **Turn 7 (t=7)**: Move left (L) to (2,2).  \n   - Why: Continues exploration into open grid. From (3,2), moving left is valid (not reverse; previous direction down). (2,2) is free, no risk. New head at (2,2), direction left. Snake: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)] (tail at (1,1) removed; no food).\n\n### Long-Term Survival Beyond Turn 7:\n- With no food left, the priority is to avoid collisions. The snake should navigate the center and bottom of the grid (e.g., towards (4,3) or (3,4)), steering clear of the internal obstacle (5,6) and walls. The grid has ample space (36 cells minus 1 obstacle), and the snake (length 5) can maneuver safely. For example:\n  - Turn 8: From (2,2), move down to (2,3) or left to (1,2) if possible, depending on direction constraints.\n  - Always check for new food if spawned, but none in this state.\n\nThis sequence scores all available food quickly and positions the snake for survival. Total actions for turns 2-7 are provided, with thinking extended beyond 5 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: L (left)\nTurn 3: U (up)\nTurn 4: R (right)\nTurn 5: R (right)\nTurn 6: D (down)\nTurn 7: L (left)\n}",
