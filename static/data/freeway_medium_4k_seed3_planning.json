        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 0, starting at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  U: y += 1\n  D: y -= 1\n  S: y remains\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T such that the car's span at turn T includes 0.\n\nImportant: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on row y_T during turn T (so only cars on row y_T at turn T can cause a collision at that turn). When we move, we are on the new row at the next turn.\n\nCar movement:\n  Left-moving: car moves left, so the entire span shifts left by s*(T-t_1) at turn T (from turn t_1).\n  Right-moving: car moves right, so the entire span shifts right by s*(T-t_1).\n\nGiven car states at turn t_1 (which is 0):\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3) -> note: the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). \n  For right-moving, head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the back (leftmost). So at turn 0, the car is from 37 to 48? But wait: the table says (head, tail) and for right-moving, the span is [tau, h]? Actually, the update rule says:\n    Right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T), h + s*(T)] at turn T.\n\nBut note the example: at turn 0, the car on freeway 1 is given as (48,37,right,3). Since it's right-moving, the head is 48 and tail is 37? Then the initial span is [37,48] (because the tail is the left end and head the right end). \n\nBut wait the update rule says for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo in this case, tau = 37, h = 48, s=3. So at time T, the span is [37+3T, 48+3T].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: two cars: \n  (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12T, 48+12T]\n  (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [12T-11, 12T]\n\nWe are at turn 0, and we are at (0,0). We want to go to (0,9). We can only move vertically.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn T if there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars and their positions at time T (relative to turn 0):\n\nFreeway 1: [37+3T, 48+3T] (right-moving)\n  We are on freeway 1 at time T if we are at y=1 at time T. Collision if 0 is in [37+3T, 48+3T]. \n  Solve: 37+3T <= 0 <= 48+3T -> \n    37+3T <= 0 => T <= -37/3 -> T<= -12.33 -> never because T>=0? \n    and 0<=48+3T is always true for T>=0? \n  But 37+3T <= 0 is false for T>=0. So actually, for T>=0, the car is always to the right of 0? \n  The left end is 37+3T. At T=0: 37 to 48 -> 0 is not in [37,48]. And as T increases, the car moves right. So never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> but wait, this representation: head=-48, tail=-59? \n  For right-moving: the head should be the rightmost. But -48 is greater than -59, so head=-48, tail=-59? \n  Then the initial span: [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. \n  At time T: [-59+6T, -48+6T].\n  Collision if 0 in [-59+6T, -48+6T] -> \n    -59+6T <= 0 <= -48+6T\n    => 6T <= 59 -> T <= 59/6 ≈ 9.83, so T<=9\n    and 6T >= 48 -> T>=8.\n    So for T=8,9: \n        T=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ] -> includes 0? \n          The interval is [-11,0] -> it includes 0? Actually, the car spans from -11 to 0, so 0 is the right end? \n          The collision condition: if 0 is in the span? Yes, because the span is [-11,0] and 0 is the endpoint? \n          So at T=8, the car covers x from -11 to 0. So if the player is at freeway 2 at T=8, then collision.\n        T=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n\n  But wait: at T=0, the car is from -59 to -48, which is entirely negative. It moves right. At T=8: [-11,0] -> includes 0? \n      The problem says: collision if 0 is in the span. So 0 is at the right endpoint? That counts.\n\n  However, note that the car is on freeway 2. So at time T=8 and T=9, if the player is on freeway 2, then collision.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as freeway 2: [ -59+6T, -48+6T ]\n  So same: collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3: collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n  First car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12T,48+12T] -> as before, for T>=0, the left end is 37, so never covers 0? \n  Second car: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [12T-11, 12T]\n      Collision if 0 in [12T-11, 12T] -> \n          12T-11 <= 0 <= 12T\n          => 12T-11<=0 -> T<=11/12 -> T=0: but at T=0, the car is [-11,0] -> includes 0? \n          So at T=0: the car is at [-11,0] -> includes 0. \n          But wait, we are at turn 0, and we are at y=0? and freeway 5 is y=5. So at turn 0, we are at y=0, not at y=5. So no collision at T=0 for freeway 5.\n\n      However, if we are at freeway 5 at time T, then we must avoid T such that 0 in [12T-11,12T]. \n          We have: 12T-11<=0<=12T -> T<=11/12 and T>=0 -> only T=0? \n          But T=0: [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included? \n          Actually, 0 is the right endpoint? So if we are at freeway 5 at T=0, we collide? But we start at y=0, so we are not at freeway 5 at T=0.\n\n      What about other T? \n          For T=1: [12-11,12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n          T=0.5? But turns are integers. So only T=0 is problematic? But we are at T=0 at y=0, so we won't be at freeway 5 at T=0.\n\n      Therefore, for freeway 5, the second car only causes collision at T=0? But we are never on freeway 5 at T=0? \n          Actually, we might be at freeway 5 at a later T? But then the car moves: at T=1: [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0. So no collision at T>=1.\n\n      So freeway 5 is safe for T>=1? \n\n  But wait: the first car on freeway 5: [37+12T,48+12T] -> always positive? So never covers 0? \n\n  Therefore, freeway 5 is safe for all T>=1? \n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: two cars: same parameters? \n  First car: (48,37,right,12) -> safe.\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,12) -> same as above: only T=0 is dangerous? but we are not on freeway 6 at T=0. So safe for T>=1.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5 and 6: safe for T>=1.\n\nFreeway 8: \n  (-48,-59,right,12) -> [ -59+12T, -48+12T ] \n      Collision if 0 in [ -59+12T, -48+12T ] \n          => -59+12T <= 0 <= -48+12T\n          => 12T <=59 -> T<=59/12≈4.916 -> T<=4\n          and 12T>=48 -> T>=4\n          So T=4: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes.\n          T=5: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> no.\n\n      So at T=4, collision on freeway 8.\n\n  And the other car: (0,-11,right,12) -> same as above: [12T-11,12T] -> dangerous only at T=0? \n\n  Therefore, freeway 8 is dangerous at T=4 (from the first car) and at T=0 (from the second car, but we aren't there at T=0).\n\nSummary of dangerous (freeway, turn) pairs:\n\nFreeway 2: T=8,9\nFreeway 3: T=8,9\nFreeway 4: T=8,9\nFreeway 8: T=4\n\nFreeways 1,5,6,7: safe at all turns? \n\nBut wait, freeway 1: we already saw safe? \nFreeway 5,6,7: safe for T>=1? and we are not at T=0? so safe.\n\nAdditionally, we must avoid being on a freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at T=0. Our goal is (0,9). We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We are constrained to y in [0,9].\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions.\n\nNote: we are at y=0 at T=0. We must end at y=9 at the last turn (say at turn T=H-1).\n\nWe can consider moving up as fast as possible: 9 steps of U: \n  T0: y0=0 -> action U -> T1: y1=1\n  T1: y1=1 -> action U -> T2: y2=2\n  ...\n  T8: y8=8 -> action U -> T9: y9=9 -> done in 9 turns.\n\nBut we must check for collisions. We will be at:\n  T0: y=0 -> no freeway? freeways are from 1 to 8. So at T0, we are at y=0 -> safe? \n  T1: y=1 -> freeway 1: safe? (we determined freeway1 is safe at all T) -> safe.\n  T2: y=2 -> freeway2: but freeway2 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9. Here T=2 -> safe.\n  T3: y=3 -> freeway3: safe because T=3 not in {8,9}\n  T4: y=4 -> freeway4: safe? T=4 not in {8,9} -> safe? but wait: freeway4 is dangerous at T=8,9 -> so safe at T=4.\n  T5: y=5 -> freeway5: safe? we said freeway5 safe for T>=1 -> T=5>=1 -> safe.\n  T6: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n  T7: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n  T8: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=8 -> freeway8 is dangerous? \n        But wait: our dangerous turns for freeway8: T=4. \n        So at T=8, freeway8 is safe? \n        Because the car on freeway8: \n            First car: [ -59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [ -59+96, -48+96] = [37,48] -> doesn't cover 0? safe.\n            Second car: [12*8-11, 12*8] = [96-11,96] = [85,96] -> doesn't cover 0? safe.\n\n        However, note that freeway8 also has the same car as freeway2? Actually, no: freeway8 has two cars: one is (-48,-59,right,12) and the other (0,-11,right,12). \n        At T=8: \n            first car: [ -59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [37,48] -> safe.\n            second car: [12*8-11, 96] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\n        So at T=8, freeway8 is safe? \n\n  Then T9: y=9 -> we are at the goal. And note: freeways are only from 1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence: \n  T0: U -> to y=1\n  T1: U -> to y=2\n  T2: U -> to y=3\n  T3: U -> to y=4\n  T4: U -> to y=5\n  T5: U -> to y=6\n  T6: U -> to y=7\n  T7: U -> to y=8\n  T8: U -> to y=9\n\nTotal 9 turns? But wait, we started at T0 (turn0) and we take 9 actions? Then we would be at turn9? \n  Actually, we have H turns? The sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1? \n  We start at t_1=0. We take H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1. \n  After H actions, we are at turn t_1+H? But the position at the end of the last action is at turn t_1+H? \n  However, the problem says: we are to find a sequence {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  Let me clarify: \n      At the start of turn t_1, we are at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n      Then we choose an action a_{t_1} (which is for the current turn) and that updates to y_{t_1+1}.\n      We do this for H actions, and at the end we are at turn t_1+H? But the problem says: \"at turn t_1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\n  Actually, the sequence of actions is for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1. And after H actions, we have taken H steps and we are at turn t_1+H? \n  But the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning the actions are taken at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-1. \n  Then the position at turn t_1+H-1 is the position after the last action? \n\n  How the turn index works:\n      At turn t_1: we are at y_{t_1}. Then we take action a_{t_1} and move to y_{t_1+1} at the next turn (turn t_1+1).\n      So after H actions, we have gone through H turns? But then the position at the last turn we acted (which is turn t_1+H-1) is the position after the (H-1)-th action? \n\n  Actually, the player update: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where the action a_t is taken at turn t.\n\n  So:\n      Turn t_1: take a_{t_1} -> then at turn t_1+1, we are at y_{t_1+1}.\n      Turn t_1+1: take a_{t_1+1} -> then at turn t_1+2, we are at y_{t_1+2}.\n      ...\n      Turn t_1+H-1: take a_{t_1+H-1} -> then at turn t_1+H, we are at y_{t_1+H}.\n\n  But the problem requires that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  This is confusing. Let me read again: \n      \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\n      and then in the answer format, we list the actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ... until the last one at turn t_1+H-1.\n\n  Also, it says: \"at turn t_1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\n  So the position at turn t_1+H-1 is (0,9). How did we get there? \n      At turn t_1+H-1, we take the last action a_{t_1+H-1} and then we move to y_{t_1+H}? \n      But the problem says we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1.\n\n  Actually, note: the state at the beginning of turn t_1 is (0,0). Then we take an action and then we are in the next turn. \n\n  The problem says: \"the player is at (0, y_{t_1}) at turn t_1\". Then we choose an action a_{t_1} which updates the player to y_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1.\n\n  Therefore, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1? \n\n  But wait: the requirement is: at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  How do we interpret the turn index? \n\n  Let me re-read: \n      \"at turn T\" the player is at (0, y_T). \n\n      And the action a_T is taken at turn T, which then updates the player to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\n  So if we are at (0,9) at turn T, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the problem requires that we take a sequence of actions until we are at (0,9) at the turn we finish.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: we are to have a sequence of actions of length H (from t_1 to t_1+H-1) such that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  How do we achieve being at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n      We start at turn t_1 (which is 0) at (0,0). \n      We take action a0 at turn0 -> then at turn1 we are at y1 = y0 + Delta y0.\n      Then at turn1 we take action a1 -> at turn2 we are at y2 = y1 + Delta y1.\n      ... \n      At turn H-1 (which is the last action) we take a_{H-1} -> then at turn H we are at y_H.\n\n      But the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. \n\n      That means at the beginning of turn H-1 (if t_1=0, then turn H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\n      How did we get there? \n          We got there by the actions taken at turns 0 to H-2? \n\n      So the last action is taken at turn H-2? and then at turn H-1 we are at (0,9) and we don't take an action at turn H-1? \n\n  But the sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1. So that would include turn H-1? \n\n  This seems inconsistent.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might mean that we take an action at turn t_1+H-1 and then immediately after that action we are at (0,9) at the next turn? But that would be turn t_1+H, not turn t_1+H-1.\n\n  Let me check the problem statement: \n      \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1: so the actions are at t_1+0, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-1.\n\n      And then it says: \"at turn t_1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\n  But if we take the last action at turn t_1+H-1, then the position at that turn (before the action) is y_{t_1+H-1}, and after the action we are at y_{t_1+H}. \n\n  So to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1, that must be the state at the beginning of that turn. Then we take an action? and then we leave? \n\n  But the requirement is that we are at (0,9) at that turn. So we can take an action at that turn? but then we move to y_{t_1+H} which might be 10? and that is invalid? \n\n  Alternatively, we might not take an action at the turn we are already at (0,9)? \n\n  However, the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so we are taking H actions. And the last action is at turn t_1+H-1. \n\n  Therefore, at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, we are at y_{t_1+H-1}, and then we take an action a_{t_1+H-1} to go to y_{t_1+H}. \n\n  But the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. \n\n  This implies that we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1. Then we take an action? but if we are at 9 and we take U, we go to 10 which is invalid. Similarly, if we take D we go to 8, and then we are not at 9. \n\n  The only possibility is to take action 'S' at turn t_1+H-1? Then we stay at 9. \n\n  But then the problem: we are at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1, and we take action S? and then we are still at 9 at turn t_1+H? \n\n  However, the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. \n\n  So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, then we take an action (maybe S) and then we are at 9 at turn t_1+H? but the problem does not require anything about turn t_1+H.\n\n  Therefore, we can design the sequence so that at the beginning of the last turn (turn H-1, since we count from 0) we are at 9? and then we do S? \n\n  But note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. \n\n  So we must arrive at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1. \n\n  How? \n      We start at turn0: y0=0.\n      We take actions a0, a1, ... a_{H-2} at turns0 to H-2, so that at turn H-1 we are at y_{H-1}=9.\n\n      Then at turn H-1 we take action a_{H-1} = S? to stay at 9? \n\n  But the problem does not require that we stay at 9 beyond that turn? it only requires that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  So the minimal H: we want to minimize H, the number of turns in the sequence? \n\n  How many actions? H actions. \n\n  How many turns of travel? We start at turn0 and end at turn H-1? \n\n  We need to get from y0=0 to y_{H-1}=9. \n\n  The minimal number of moves? We must move up 9 times? but we can also move down and then up? but that would take more moves. \n\n  The minimal number of moves to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves of U. \n\n  Then we would have: \n      Turn0: start at 0, take U -> to 1 at turn1.\n      Turn1: at 1, take U -> to 2 at turn2.\n      ...\n      Turn8: at 8, take U -> to 9 at turn9.\n\n      Now, at the beginning of turn9, we are at y9? but we want to be at 9 at turn H-1. \n\n      If we take H actions, then the last action is at turn H-1. \n\n      We want at the beginning of turn H-1 to be at 9? \n\n      How did we get to 9? \n          We got to 9 at the beginning of turn9? because we moved from 8 to 9 at the action taken at turn8.\n\n      So at the beginning of turn9, we are at 9.\n\n      Therefore, we set H-1 = 9? -> H = 10.\n\n      Then the sequence has 10 actions? but we only took 9 moves? \n\n      Actually, we have to take an action at turn9? to do something? but we are already at 9. \n\n      We can do S at turn9. \n\n      Then the sequence: \n          Turn0: U\n          Turn1: U\n          ...\n          Turn8: U -> after this, at turn9 we are at 9.\n          Turn9: S -> then we stay at 9 at turn10? \n\n      But the problem requires that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n          H=10, so t_1+H-1 = 0+10-1 = 9. \n          At turn9, we are at the beginning of turn9? but wait: at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9? \n\n      How did we get to 9 at the beginning of turn9? \n          We started turn8 at y8=8, then we took U at turn8 -> so at the end of turn8 (which is the beginning of turn9) we are at 9.\n\n      Therefore, at the beginning of turn9, we are at 9. \n\n      Then we take action S at turn9? and then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn10? \n\n      But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn9. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn9? so that satisfies.\n\n      However, note that the collision condition: at turn9, we are at y9=9? and freeways are only 1-8, so safe.\n\n      But what about the actions? \n          We have 10 actions: \n            Turn0: U -> to 1 at turn1 -> at turn1: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 -> safe? yes.\n            Turn1: U -> to 2 at turn2 -> freeway2 at turn2: safe? because dangerous only at T=8,9 -> safe.\n            ...\n            Turn8: U -> to 9 at turn9 -> at turn9: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n            Turn9: S -> we are still at 9 at turn10? but the problem doesn't care about turn10.\n\n      But is there a problem at turn9? \n          We are at y=9 at turn9 -> safe.\n\n      So H=10? \n\n  Alternatively, can we be at 9 at the beginning of turn8? \n      That would require that we moved from 0 to 9 in 8 moves? \n          We need 9 moves of U? so that would be 9 moves. \n\n      We cannot do it in 8 moves? \n\n  Therefore, minimal H=10.\n\nBut wait: let me check the freeway2 at turn8 and turn9? \n  In our plan, we are at freeway2 at turn2? which is safe. \n  But what about at turn8? we are at freeway8 at turn8? \n        We are at y=8 at turn8? \n        Then at the beginning of turn8, we are at 8? \n        Then we take U at turn8 -> then we move to 9 at the beginning of turn9.\n\n        So at turn8, we are at freeway8? \n        We determined that freeway8 is dangerous at T=4? \n        But T=8 is safe? \n        So that's fine.\n\n  However, note that freeway2,3,4 are dangerous at T=8 and T=9? \n        But we are not on freeway2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9? \n        At T=8: we are at y=8? which is freeway8 -> safe.\n        At T=9: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\n  So the entire sequence is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is H=10, and the sequence:\n\n      Turn0: U\n      Turn1: U\n      Turn2: U\n      Turn3: U\n      Turn4: U\n      Turn5: U\n      Turn6: U\n      Turn7: U\n      Turn8: U\n      Turn9: S   # because we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn9, so we just stay.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at turn9? so we don't need to do anything? \n\n  However, the sequence must have H actions. We are required to have H actions? and the last action is at turn9. \n\n  We can also consider: do we need to do S? \n\n  Alternatively, we could do:\n\n      We do 9 U's and then we are done? but then the sequence would be 9 actions? and the last action is at turn8? \n      Then at the beginning of turn9, we are at 9? \n      But the problem requires that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n      If we take 9 actions, then H=9, so we are to be at (0,9) at turn 0+9-1 = 8? \n      But at the beginning of turn8, we are at y8? which is 8 (because we took 8 U's by turn7, so at the beginning of turn8 we are at 8). Then we take U at turn8 -> then at turn9 we are at 9. \n      So at turn8 (the last action turn) we are at 8, not 9.\n\n      Therefore, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn9, which is the beginning of turn t_1+9? so we set H=10? \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might mean that we are at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\n  But the problem says: \"at turn t_1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\n  And the last action is taken at turn t_1+H-1. \n\n  Therefore, the state at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 is the state we are concerned with for collision? and also for the goal? \n\n  So we require that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, y_{t_1+H-1} = 9.\n\n  How do we achieve that? \n      We start at turn0: y0=0.\n      After action0 (at turn0): we are at y1 = y0 + a0 -> so at turn1: y1 = 0 + (if a0=U) 1.\n      We require that at the beginning of turn H-1 (if t_1=0, then turn H-1), we have y_{H-1}=9.\n\n      How is y_{H-1} computed? \n          y_{H-1} = y0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{H-2}) = 0 + (number of U - number of D) in the first H-1 actions.\n\n      We require: number of U - number of D = 9.\n\n      And the actions are U, D, S (which count as 0). \n\n      The minimal number of actions to get 9 net U? we need at least 9 U's and no D's? \n\n      So the minimal H-1 = 9? then H=10.\n\n      Then we have 9 U's and one extra action? which must be at the last step? \n\n      At the last action (at turn H-1 = turn9) we take an action. But at the beginning of turn9, we are already at 9? so we can take S.\n\n      Therefore, the sequence: \n          9 U's and then 1 S? \n          But the 9 U's are taken at turns0 to 8? and then at turn9 we take S.\n\n      Then at the beginning of turn0: y0=0.\n      After turn0 (action U): y1=1.\n      ... \n      After turn8 (action U): y9=9.\n      Then at the beginning of turn9: we are at 9 -> goal condition satisfied at turn9 (which is H-1=9? H=10).\n\n  So that works.\n\n  But note: we could also take D at the last step? that would ruin it. So we must take S.\n\n  Alternatively, we could do 10 U's? \n      Then at turn0: U -> y1=1\n      ... \n      turn9: U -> y10=10 -> invalid! because y must be in [0,9]. \n\n  So we cannot do 10 U's.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence is 9 U's and 1 S at the end.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to do it in fewer than 10 actions? \n  We must be at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1. \n  The net upward moves must be 9. \n  Each U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0.\n  The minimal number of actions to achieve a net +9? \n      We can do 9 U's and any number of D and then U to compensate? but that would be more than 9 actions? \n      The minimal is 9 actions? but then we would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn8? \n      How? \n          After 9 actions? the first 9 actions (turns0 to 8) would give net +9? then at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9? \n          But then we don't take an action at turn9? but the sequence must have H=9 actions? so the last action is at turn8? \n          Then at turn8 we take the last action? and then at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9? \n          That would satisfy: at turn t_1+H-1 = 0+9-1 = 8? but we are at 9 at the beginning of turn9, not turn8? \n\n      We require at turn8 (the beginning of turn8) to be at 9? \n          But at the beginning of turn8, we have taken 7 actions? so we are at y8 = 0 + (net of first 7 actions). \n          To be at 9, we need 9 net moves? but we only had 7 actions? so we can only have 7 net moves? maximum 7? \n\n      Therefore, we cannot be at 9 at the beginning of turn8.\n\n  So minimal H=10.\n\nNow, we must check the entire path for collisions:\n\n  Turn0: at y0=0 (safe, not a freeway) -> then we take U -> then at turn1 we are at y1=1.\n  Turn1: at y1=1 -> freeway1: safe? (as we determined) -> then take U -> at turn2: y2=2.\n  Turn2: at y2=2 -> freeway2: at turn2 -> safe? because freeway2 is dangerous at T=8,9 -> safe -> take U -> turn3: y3=3.\n  Turn3: at y3=3 -> freeway3: safe (T=3) -> take U -> turn4: y4=4.\n  Turn4: at y4=4 -> freeway4: safe (T=4 not in {8,9}) -> take U -> turn5: y5=5.\n  Turn5: at y5=5 -> freeway5: safe (T=5>=1) -> take U -> turn6: y6=6.\n  Turn6: at y6=6 -> freeway6: safe -> take U -> turn7: y7=7.\n  Turn7: at y7=7 -> freeway7: safe -> take U -> turn8: y8=8.\n  Turn8: at y8=8 -> freeway8: at T=8 -> \n        cars: \n          first car: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [96-59, 96-48] = [37,48] -> safe (0 not in [37,48])\n          second car: [12*8-11, 12*8] = [96-11,96] = [85,96] -> safe.\n        so safe -> take U -> then at turn9: y9=9.\n  Turn9: at y9=9 -> safe (not a freeway) -> take S -> then at turn10: y10=9.\n\n  But note: the goal condition is at turn9 (H-1=9) we are at (0,9). At the beginning of turn9, we are at 9? \n        How? \n          We started turn8 at y8=8? then we took U at turn8 -> so at the end of turn8 (which is the beginning of turn9) we are at 9.\n\n  Therefore, at the beginning of turn9, we are at 9 -> so goal satisfied.\n\n  And we take action S at turn9? which is allowed and doesn't move us.\n\n  So the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"current turn is t_1\", and in the answer we are to write for turns starting at t_1. \n  In the state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 = 0\" and \"Player Position: (0,0)\" at turn0.\n\n  So we start at turn0. \n\n  Therefore, the above sequence.\n\nHowever, note that freeway5,6,7: we said they are safe for T>=1. \n  At turn5: T=5? which is >=1 -> safe.\n  Similarly, turn6: T=6, turn7: T=7 -> safe.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at T=5:\n  First car: [37+12*5,48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n  Second car: [12*5-11,12*5] = [60-11,60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at T=8: as above, safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut note: the problem says that when moving, we are not considered to be on the new row until the next turn. So in the above, when we move from y=8 at turn8 to y=9 at turn9, at turn8 we are on freeway8 and then we leave freeway8 at the next turn. \n\nAnd at turn8, we are on freeway8? and we checked that freeway8 at T=8 is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to do it in 9 turns? \n  We require: at turn H-1 (which would be 8 if H=9) we are at 9? \n      How? \n          We start at turn0:0.\n          We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn8? \n          Then the net moves in the first 8 actions (from turn0 to turn7) must be 9? \n          But 8 actions? maximum net upward is 8? (if we do 8 U's). \n          So we cannot be at 9 at the beginning of turn8.\n\n  Therefore, H=10 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nHowever, let me see if we can avoid the last S? \n  The problem: we are to provide a sequence of H actions. \n  We must have an action for turn9? because we are at turn9? \n  But if we don't do an action? we must do one. \n\n  We could stop after 9 actions? but then the sequence would be 9 actions? and then we would not cover turn9? \n  But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn9? and we are there? but the problem requires a sequence of H actions that leads to being at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. \n      If H=9, then we are to be at (0,9) at turn 0+9-1=8? but we are at 9 at turn9? not turn8.\n\n  So we must have H=10.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 10. The sequence of actions ensures the player moves upward as quickly as possible while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). \n\nThe path is verified to be collision-free:\n- At each turn, the player's position is checked against car spans on the corresponding freeway.\n- Freeways 2, 3, and 4 are dangerous at turns 8 and 9, but the player is on freeway 8 at turn 8 (safe, as freeway 8 is only dangerous at turn 4) and at \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway) at turn 9.\n- Freeways 1, 5, 6, and 7 are safe at all relevant turns.\n- The last action (S at turn 9) maintains the player at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying the goal at turn 9 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6. The player starts at (0,0) and needs to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\n Important: The collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is one of 1..8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n Note: The player moves at the same time as the cars. The update for the car is continuous in time? Actually, the problem gives the span at integer turns.\n\n Also note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is on row y. Then at turn T+1, the player moves to row y'. So during the entire turn T, the player is on row y and only checks the cars on row y at turn T.\n\n Therefore, to avoid collision, for each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, if the player is on a freeway row y (between 1 and 8) at that turn, then the cars on that row must not have 0 in their span at turn T.\n\n The car spans are given at turn t1 (which is 6). Then for any future turn T (>=6), we can compute the car's span at turn T.\n\n How to compute the car's span at turn T (where T>=6, and t1=6 is the current turn):\n\n For a car given at t1=6 with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n   Let delta_t = T - 6.\n\n   If direction is 'right':\n        The car moves to the right (positive x direction) at speed s per turn.\n        So at turn T, the head becomes: head0 + s * delta_t\n        and the tail becomes: tail0 + s * delta_t\n\n        Note: In the given data, for right-moving cars, the span at t1 is [tail, head]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \n            Span(t1) = [tau, h]   (so tau is the tail, h is the head) and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   Similarly, for left-moving: \n        Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\n But note: In the given data, we have both. However, all the cars in the current state are right-moving? Let's check:\n\n    Freeway 1: (48,37,right,3) -> at t1=6, span is [37,48]? Actually the problem says for right: [tau, head] = [37,48]? \n        But the problem representation: for right-moving, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n        However, in the table, it's written as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n        The problem says: \n          For car k: head = h, tail = tau, and then for right: Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> meaning tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost? \n          But note: if a car is moving right, then at t1, the tail is at 37 and head at 48? Then the car spans from 37 to 48.\n\n        Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \n            \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] ... becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n        So the representation (head, tail) for a right-moving car: \n            head = h (the rightmost point) and tail = tau (the leftmost point).\n\n        Similarly, for left-moving: \n            head = h (the leftmost point) and tail = tau (the rightmost point)? \n\n        But the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] and becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n\n        So for left-moving, h is the leftmost and tau is the rightmost? \n\n        However, in the given data, all cars are right-moving? \n\n        Let me see: \n            Freeway 1: (48,37,right,3) -> so head=48, tail=37 -> at t1=6, the car spans [37,48] (x-coordinates).\n\n        Freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). \n            First car: [37,48] at t1=6? \n            Second car: [-11,0] at t1=6? \n\n        But note: the second car on freeway 5: head=0, tail=-11 -> so the car spans from -11 to 0? \n\n        However, the problem says for right-moving: the head is the rightmost? So if the car is moving right, then the head is the front (right end) and tail is the back (left end). \n\n        So we'll represent a right-moving car at turn T (>=6) as:\n            left_end = tau0 + s*(T-6)\n            right_end = head0 + s*(T-6)\n\n        And the car covers [left_end, right_end] at turn T.\n\n        Similarly, for a left-moving car (none in this problem) we would have:\n            left_end = head0 - s*(T-6)\n            right_end = tau0 - s*(T-6)\n\n        But note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h-s*(T-6), tau-s*(T-6)] -> which would be [head0 - s*(T-6), tail0 - s*(T-6)]. \n        However, in a left-moving car, the head (front) is the leftmost? Then the span would be [head0, tail0] at t1? But then when moving left, the entire car moves left.\n\n        Since all cars in the problem are right-moving, we only need the right-moving formula.\n\n The goal: we start at (0,0) at turn 6. We can take actions U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay). But note: y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\n We need to get to y=9. Note that the freeways are only from 1 to 8. The rows 0 and 9 are safe (no cars).\n\n Therefore, we must avoid being on rows 1..8 at any turn T if at that turn T, there is a car on that row that covers x=0.\n\n How to plan?\n\n We are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, since each step cost is 1) over the state: (turn, y). But note: the turn can be large? The cars move, and we might have to wait.\n\n However, note that the cars are moving at constant speed and we are only concerned about when the car's span covers x=0. Since the cars are moving continuously, the condition is periodic? Actually, it's linear.\n\n But the speeds are different per car and per freeway.\n\n We have to compute for each freeway and each car, the set of turns T (>=6) for which the car covers x=0.\n\n However, note that we can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) during which the car covers x=0.\n\n But note: a freeway might have multiple cars. So the freeway k is dangerous at turn T if at least one car on k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\n We are going to compute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on k, the time intervals (in terms of turns) when the car covers x=0.\n\n Then the freeway k is dangerous at turn T if T falls in any of these intervals for any car on k.\n\n Since we are only concerned about integer turns (T is integer), we can compute the intervals of T (integer) for which the car covers x=0.\n\n For a right-moving car (head0, tail0, right, s) at t1=6:\n\n   At turn T (>=6), the car covers [tail0 + s*(T-6), head0 + s*(T-6)].\n\n   We require: \n        tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head0 + s*(T-6)\n\n   => \n        T >= ( - tail0 ) / s + 6   and   T <= ( - head0 ) / s + 6   ??? Let me rearrange:\n\n        tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0  => T <= ( - tail0 ) / s + 6? \n        Actually: \n            tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0   => s*(T-6) <= -tail0   => T-6 <= -tail0/s   => T <= 6 - tail0/s.\n\n        But wait: if tail0 is negative (like -11) then -tail0 is positive? \n\n        Let me do it properly:\n\n        Condition: \n            A: tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0   -> T-6 <= (-tail0)/s   -> T <= 6 + (-tail0)/s\n            B: 0 <= head0 + s*(T-6)   -> T-6 >= (-head0)/s   -> T >= 6 + (-head0)/s\n\n        So: \n            T must be in the interval: [ ceil(6 - head0/s), floor(6 - tail0/s) ] ??? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n            tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0   => T-6 <= -tail0/s   => T <= 6 + (-tail0)/s   (if s>0, which it is)\n\n            and \n            head0 + s*(T-6) >= 0   => T-6 >= -head0/s   => T >= 6 + (-head0)/s\n\n        Therefore, the interval for T is:\n            T in [ 6 + ceil( (-head0) / s ), 6 + floor( (-tail0) / s ) ]   ??? But note: (-head0) might be negative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            T_min = ceil( 6 - head0/s )\n            T_max = floor( 6 - tail0/s )\n\n        But let's test with an example:\n\n        Example: freeway 5, second car: (head0, tail0) = (0, -11), s=12.\n\n            Condition: \n                T_min: 6 - 0/12 = 6 -> ceil(6)=6\n                T_max: 6 - (-11)/12 = 6 + 11/12 = 6.916... -> floor(6.916)=6\n\n            So the interval is [6,6]. So only at turn 6.\n\n        Let's check: at turn T=6: \n            tail0 + s*(0) = -11 -> which is <=0? yes.\n            head0 + s*(0)=0 -> which is >=0? yes -> so 0 is in [-11,0] -> yes.\n\n        Now at turn T=7:\n            tail0 + s*(1) = -11+12=1 -> which is >0 -> so 0 is not in [1,12] -> no.\n\n        So the interval for that car is T=6 only.\n\n        But note: the condition for the car to cover 0 is:\n\n            tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head0 + s*(T-6)\n\n        For T=6: -11<=0<=0 -> true.\n        For T=7: 1<=0<=12 -> false.\n\n        So the interval is T=6 only.\n\n        How about the first car on freeway 5: (48,37,right,12)\n            T_min = ceil(6 - 48/12) = ceil(6-4)=ceil(2)=2\n            T_max = floor(6 - 37/12) = floor(6 - 3.083) = floor(2.916)=2\n\n            So only at turn 2? But we start at turn 6, so we don't care about turn 2. \n\n        So for freeway 5 at turn 6: \n            The second car is present at turn 6? So at turn 6, freeway 5 has a car that covers 0.\n\n        Therefore, at turn 6, if the player is on freeway 5, they would collide. But note: we start at turn 6 on row 0, so we are safe.\n\n        Now, what about turn 7? \n            For the second car: we saw it moves to [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n            For the first car: at T=7: \n                left = 37+12*1 = 49, right=48+12*1=60 -> so [49,60] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n        So freeway 5 is safe at turn 7? \n\n        However, note that the freeway 5 has two cars. We must check both.\n\n        Actually, we need to compute for each freeway the set of turns T (>=6) for which at least one car on that freeway covers 0.\n\n Let's compute for each freeway and each car the dangerous turns (>=6). Then we can mark for each freeway and each turn T>=6 whether it is dangerous.\n\n We'll make a 2D array: dangerous[k][T] for k in 1..8 and T>=6. But T can be large? However, we are going to plan until we reach 9, so we can bound the turns we consider.\n\n Since the minimal number of turns to get to 9 from 0 is 9 (if we go up every time). But we might have to wait. So we might need up to ...? \n\n We note that the cars are moving and eventually will pass. Since the cars move at integer speeds and the grid is infinite, the dangerous intervals are finite? \n\n Actually, for a car, the dangerous interval is a contiguous set of integer turns. And because the car moves continuously, once it passes 0 it won't come back? So each car has at most one contiguous interval of dangerous turns? \n\n Therefore, for each freeway, the dangerous turns are the union of intervals from each car. We can represent the dangerous turns per freeway as a set of intervals.\n\n But note: we are only concerned from T=6 onward.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of dangerous turns (T>=6) when the freeway is dangerous.\n\n 2. Then we do a BFS (state: (t, y)) where t is the turn (starting at 6) and y is the row (0..9). The cost is the number of turns (t-6). We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\n    Actions: U, D, S. Note that D from y=0 is not allowed (since y must be in [0,9])? Actually, the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go down from 0, we stay at 0? \n\n    But the problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then we clamp to [0,9]? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we are at y=0 and try to go down, then y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1)=0.\n\n    Similarly, at y=9 and U, we get 9.\n\n 3. We avoid states where at turn t, if the player is on a freeway row y (in 1..8) and that freeway is dangerous at turn t.\n\n 4. We start at (t=6, y=0). \n\n    At turn 6: we are on row 0 -> safe (no freeway car check for row 0).\n\n    Then at the next turn, we can choose an action and move.\n\n 5. We'll simulate until we get to y=9.\n\n How to represent the dangerous intervals?\n\n   We can precompute for each freeway k, a function that given T (>=6) returns whether it is dangerous.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the intervals and then during BFS, for a state (t, y) with y in 1..8, we check if freeway y is dangerous at turn t.\n\n   How to compute the dangerous intervals for a freeway k?\n\n        For each car on freeway k (with head0, tail0, direction='right', speed s):\n\n            We require T>=6.\n\n            Condition: \n                tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head0 + s*(T-6)\n\n            Solve for T:\n\n                T_min = ceil( ( -head0 ) / s + 6 )? \n\n            Actually:\n\n                From: 0 <= head0 + s*(T-6)  => T-6 >= -head0/s  => T >= 6 - head0/s.\n\n                And: tail0 + s*(T-6) <= 0  => T-6 <= -tail0/s  => T <= 6 - tail0/s.\n\n            Therefore, the dangerous T for this car is the integer T in [ max(6, ceil(6 - head0/s)), min( ... , floor(6 - tail0/s)) ]?\n\n            But note: we are only concerned about T>=6.\n\n            Since the condition must hold, we have:\n\n                Lower bound: T_low = ceil(6 - head0/s)   [if this value is less than 6, we use 6? but note: T>=6]\n                Upper bound: T_high = floor(6 - tail0/s)\n\n            Then the dangerous turns for this car are the integers T in [ max(6, ceil(6 - head0/s)), floor(6 - tail0/s) ]? \n\n            But note: we have to check the direction of inequalities. Also, if T_low <= T_high, then the interval is [T_low, T_high]. Otherwise, the car never covers 0 at or after turn 6.\n\n        Example: car (0, -11, right, 12) on freeway 5:\n\n            head0=0, tail0=-11, s=12.\n\n            T_low = ceil(6 - 0/12) = ceil(6)=6\n            T_high = floor(6 - (-11)/12) = floor(6+11/12)=floor(6.916)=6\n\n            So [6,6].\n\n        Example: car (48,37,right,12) on freeway 5:\n\n            T_low = ceil(6 - 48/12)=ceil(6-4)=ceil(2)=2\n            T_high = floor(6 - 37/12)=floor(6-3.083)=floor(2.916)=2\n\n            So [2,2] -> but we start at 6, so we ignore.\n\n        Example: freeway 1: (48,37,right,3)\n\n            T_low = ceil(6 - 48/3)=ceil(6-16)=ceil(-10)=-10 -> so we take max(6,-10)=6\n            T_high = floor(6 - 37/3)=floor(6-12.333)=floor(-6.333)=-7 -> so no integer T in [6, -7] -> empty.\n\n            Actually: 6 - 48/3 = 6-16 = -10 -> ceil(-10)=-10 -> but then we use max(6,-10)=6.\n            Then T_high = 6 - 37/3 = 6 - 12.333 = -6.333 -> floor is -7 -> but then [6, -7] is empty.\n\n            Let me check: \n                Condition: \n                    37 + 3*(T-6) <= 0 <= 48 + 3*(T-6)\n\n                At T=6: 37<=0<=48 -> false.\n                At T=7: 37+3=40<=0? false.\n\n            So indeed, this car never covers 0 at or after turn 6.\n\n        Example: freeway 8: two cars: \n            car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> note: head0=-48, tail0=-59? \n                T_low = ceil(6 - (-48)/12)=ceil(6+4)=ceil(10)=10\n                T_high = floor(6 - (-59)/12)=floor(6+59/12)=floor(6+4.916)=floor(10.916)=10\n                So [10,10] -> dangerous at T=10.\n\n            car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> we already know: dangerous at T=6.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 8 is dangerous at turns 6 and 10.\n\n        But note: at turn 6, we are at row 0, so we don't care about row 8 at turn 6. However, if we are at row 8 at turn 10, then we collide.\n\n        Similarly, freeway 5: at turn 6: dangerous because of the second car. Then at turn 7 and beyond, it's safe? \n\n        However, we must check both cars: \n            car1: (48,37,right,12) -> dangerous only at turn 2 -> not in [6,?]\n            car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> dangerous at turn 6.\n\n        So freeway 5: dangerous at turn 6 only.\n\n        Similarly, freeway 6: same as 5? \n            It has two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) -> dangerous at turn 6.\n\n        Freeway 7: same as 5 -> dangerous at turn 6.\n\n        Freeway 8: dangerous at turn 6 (from the second car) and turn 10 (from the first car).\n\n        Freeway 1: not dangerous at any turn>=6.\n\n        Freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> \n            head0=-48, tail0=-59, s=6.\n            T_low = ceil(6 - (-48)/6)=ceil(6+8)=ceil(14)=14\n            T_high = floor(6 - (-59)/6)=floor(6+59/6)=floor(6+9.833)=15\n            So [14,15] -> dangerous at turns 14 and 15.\n\n        Freeway 3: same as freeway 2? because same parameters -> [14,15]\n\n        Freeway 4: same -> [14,15]\n\n        Freeway 8: we already did: [6] and [10] (from two cars).\n\n        But note: freeway 8 has two cars: \n            car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> [10] (as above)\n            car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [6]\n\n        So overall, freeway 8 is dangerous at T=6 and T=10.\n\n        However, note that at turn 6, we are at row 0, so we don't care about row 8 at that turn. Similarly, if we are on row 8 at turn 10, we must avoid.\n\n        We'll create a set or a function for each freeway:\n\n          freeway_danger[k] = set of dangerous turns (T>=6) for freeway k.\n\n        Or we can create a function: \n            def is_dangerous(k, T):\n                for each car on freeway k:\n                    if T in [T_low, T_high] (computed for that car) then return True\n                return False\n\n        But we precomputed for each car the interval [T_low, T_high]? Actually, we computed a single contiguous interval per car? \n\n        However, note: a car might have multiple intervals? But because the car moves linearly and the road is infinite, it will cover 0 at most once? \n\n        So yes, one contiguous interval per car.\n\n        We can precompute for each freeway k, a sorted list of intervals (for the cars on k) and then merge them? Or simply create a set of dangerous turns for each freeway for T from 6 to, say, 20 (since we don't expect to take more than 20 turns?).\n\n        But to be safe, we can compute the intervals mathematically and then during the BFS, for a state (t,y) we check if y is in 1..8 and then check if t is in the set of dangerous turns for freeway y.\n\n        However, note: the dangerous turns for a freeway might be sparse. We can precompute the dangerous turns per freeway as a set.\n\n        Steps for precomputation for freeway k:\n\n            dangerous_set_k = set()\n            for each car in freeway k:\n                head0 = head, tail0 = tail, s = speed, direction (all right in this problem)\n                # Compute T_low and T_high for this car for T>=6\n                T_low = max(6, math.ceil(6 - head0/s))\n                T_high = min( ... , math.floor(6 - tail0/s))   # but note: we have to make sure T_high>=T_low\n\n                # But note: it's possible that T_low > T_high -> then skip.\n                if T_low <= T_high:\n                    for t_val in range(T_low, T_high+1):\n                        dangerous_set_k.add(t_val)\n\n        Then freeway k is dangerous at turn T if T is in dangerous_set_k.\n\n        However, the range might be large? For example, if the car is very long and slow, the interval might be large? But in our data, the speeds are at least 3 and the head0 and tail0 are not too extreme.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid building a set by having a function that checks the condition for a given (k, T) by iterating over the cars. But that might be expensive if we do for every state.\n\n        Since the number of cars per freeway is at most 2 and the number of turns we consider is not too large (we bound the BFS by, say, 20 turns), we can precompute the dangerous sets for each freeway for T from 6 to 6+max_turns (we can set max_turns to 20, since minimal is 9 and we might have to wait a few).\n\n        Let max_turns = 20 -> so we consider T from 6 to 26.\n\n        We'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for T in [6,26], whether it is dangerous.\n\n        Then in the BFS, we can quickly check.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Let max_T = 26 (if we take more than 20 turns, we may not find a solution? but we are doing BFS so we will eventually, but we set a limit)\n\n    Precomputation:\n\n        dangerous = {}   # dictionary: dangerous[k] for k in 1..8 is a set of turns T (in [6,26]) for which freeway k is dangerous.\n\n        Actually, we can make a 2D array: danger[k][t] for k in 1..8 and t in 6..26, initially False.\n\n        For each freeway k and each car on k:\n            head0, tail0, d, s = car\n            if d == 'right':\n                # compute T_low = max(6, ceil(6 - head0/s))\n                T_low = max(6, math.ceil(6 - head0/s))\n                T_high = math.floor(6 - tail0/s)\n                if T_high < T_low:\n                    continue\n                # But we are only interested in T in [6,26]\n                T_low = max(T_low, 6)\n                T_high = min(T_high, 26)\n                for t_val in range(int(T_low), int(T_high)+1):\n                    mark danger[k][t_val] = True   # or we can use a set per freeway: then we do dangerous_set[k].add(t_val)\n\n        We'll create dangerous_set as a set for each freeway.\n\n    Then in the BFS:\n\n        We consider states (t, y). We start at (6,0) with cost 0.\n\n        We use a queue: each state is (t, y, path) but to avoid storing long paths, we can store the actions separately.\n\n        Actually, we need to output the sequence of actions. So we store the path: a list of actions taken so far (from turn 6 to t-1, because at state (t,y) we have taken actions for turns 6 to t-1).\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the parent pointers.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            visited[state] = (parent_state, action)   where state = (t,y)\n\n        Then we can backtrack.\n\n        But note: the state (t,y) might be reached by different paths? and we want minimal turns? so we do BFS (by increasing t).\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let queue = deque()\n            start: t=6, y=0, actions_so_far = [] (no action taken yet, because at turn 6 we are at (0,0), then at the end of turn 6 we choose an action for the next state at turn 7? \n\n            Actually, the problem: at turn t1 (6) we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action a_{6} to determine the state at turn 7? \n\n            The update: \n                At turn 6: we are at (0,0). Then we choose a_{6} (which will be applied at turn 6) to get the state at turn 7: \n                    y_7 = y_6 + Delta y_6.\n\n            So at the start (turn 6) we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action for turn 6.\n\n            Then at turn 7, we are at (0, y_7).\n\n            Therefore, we must record the action for turn 6.\n\n            We'll simulate:\n\n                state at the beginning of turn t: (t, y) -> then we choose an action a, which leads to state (t+1, y') where y' = clamp(y + delta, 0,9)\n\n                And then at the new state (t+1, y'), we check if at turn t+1, if y' is in [1,8] then we check if freeway y' is dangerous at turn t+1? \n\n                But note: the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (at that turn) and freeway y is dangerous at turn T.\n\n                In the state (t,y) we are at the beginning of turn t? \n\n                Actually, the problem says: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then the car update at turn T is computed. Then we check collision at turn T.\n\n                So at the state (t,y) at the beginning of turn t, we are about to choose an action. But note: the collision for the current state (t,y) has already happened? \n\n                However, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\" and we are at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\n                So when we are at state (t,y) at the beginning of turn t, we are at (0,y) at turn t. Therefore, if y is in [1,8] and freeway y is dangerous at turn t, then we collide and this state is invalid.\n\n                But wait: we start at (6,0): y=0 -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn 6, we choose an action. Then at turn 7, we are at (0,y7). Then at turn 7, we check: if y7 is in [1,8] and freeway y7 is dangerous at turn 7 -> then we avoid that state.\n\n            Therefore, when we generate a new state (t', y') from state (t,y) by taking action a at turn t, the new state (t+1, y') must be checked for collision at turn t+1? \n\n            Actually, the collision check happens at the beginning of the turn? \n\n            The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\", meaning during the entire turn T? \n\n            And note: the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T. So at the beginning of turn T, the player is at that position and remains there for the entire turn? \n\n            Then the collision condition is checked at the beginning of the turn? \n\n            Actually, the problem does not specify the timing. But it says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". \n\n            So during turn T, the player is on row y_T. Therefore, the collision check at turn T only considers row y_T.\n\n            Therefore, when we are at state (t,y) (which is the state at the beginning of turn t), we must check if y is in [1,8] and if freeway y is dangerous at turn t. If yes, then we cannot be in this state -> so we avoid.\n\n            However, note: we start at (6,0) -> safe.\n\n            Then we choose an action at turn 6, which leads to state (7, y7). Then at the beginning of turn 7, we are at (0,y7) and we check if that state is safe (i.e., if y7 is 0 or 9, safe; if in 1..8, then check danger at turn 7).\n\n        Therefore, in the BFS:\n\n            We start with (6,0) -> safe.\n\n            Then we generate next states for turn 7: by taking action at turn 6.\n\n            Then at the new state (7, y7) we check for collision at turn 7.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            Let dist[t][y] = minimum number of turns taken to reach (t,y) (or we don't need the dist, we do BFS by t)\n\n            We use a queue: each node is (t, y). We start at (6,0) with dist=0? but the number of turns H is the number of actions taken? \n\n            Actually, we take one action per turn. We start at turn 6, and after H actions we will be at turn 6+H. And we require that at turn 6+H-1 we are at y=9? \n\n            Actually, the problem: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n            The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1 -> so we take H actions. Then the state after H actions is at turn t1+H.\n\n            And we require that at turn t1+H-1? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n            How do we index?\n\n                We start at turn t1 (6) at (0,0). Then we take action a_{6} (which is the first action) at turn 6 -> leads to state at turn 7: (0,y7).\n\n                Then we take action a_{7} at turn 7 -> leads to turn 8.\n\n                ...\n\n                We take the last action a_{t1+H-1} at turn 6+H-1 -> leads to state at turn 6+H.\n\n                And we require that at turn 6+H-1? the last action is taken at turn 6+H-1, and then we are at (0,9) at the next state? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n                t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_6\n                t=1: a_{t1+1} = a_7\n                ...\n                t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{6+H-1}\n\n            Then after taking these H actions, we are at turn 6+H? \n\n            And we require that at turn 6+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\n            But note: the action taken at turn 6+H-1 determines the state at turn 6+H. So at the end of turn 6+H-1, we take an action that moves to the state at turn 6+H.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\n            Or at the end of turn t1+H-1? \n\n            The problem states: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. \n\n            And note: at the beginning of turn t, the player is at (0,y_t). \n\n            So at turn t, the player is at (0,y_t) at the beginning of the turn. \n\n            Therefore, we require that at the beginning of turn 6+H-1, the player is at (0,9).\n\n            How do we achieve that?\n\n                We start at turn 6: (0,0).\n\n                We take H-1 actions? \n\n                But the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1 -> H actions.\n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. \n\n            Then after H actions, we are at turn 6+H. \n\n            But the requirement is: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n            This seems inconsistent.\n\n            Let me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n            So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n            How many actions have we taken by then?\n\n                We start at turn t1 (6). Then:\n\n                    turn t1: we are at (0,0) -> no action taken yet? \n                    then we take an action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> which affects the state at turn t1+1.\n\n                Therefore, to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have taken H-2 actions? \n\n            Alternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\n            But the problem explicitly says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n            Clarification: the player update rule: \n                y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t   [at the end of turn t, after taking action a_t]\n\n            Then at the beginning of turn t+1, the player is at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\n            Therefore, after taking an action at turn t, the next state (at the beginning of turn t+1) is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\n            So to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that led to y_{T}=9.\n\n            We start at turn 6: at (0,0). We want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T. Then T must be at least 7? \n\n            Example: if we take action U at turn 6, then at the beginning of turn 7 we are at (0,1). \n\n            How do we get to (0,9) at the beginning of turn T? \n\n                We need to have taken 9 upward moves? but we start at 0. \n\n                Actually, we need exactly 9 upward moves? but we can also move down? \n\n                Minimal H: we need to move from 0 to 9: at least 9 upward moves? \n\n                But note: we can also move down and then up? that would take more turns.\n\n                So minimal H is 9? meaning 9 actions? then we are at turn 6+9 = 15? and at the beginning of turn 15 we are at (0,9).\n\n            How?\n\n                Turn 6: start at (0,0) -> then we take 9 actions: \n                    a_6, a_7, ... a_14.\n\n                Then the state at the beginning of turn 15 is (0, y_15) = (0,9).\n\n            Therefore, the sequence of actions is for turns 6 to 14 (9 actions). Then the minimal H is 9? \n\n            But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H actions? \n\n            Then we require H=9.\n\n            However, we might have to wait because of the cars? so we might take more than 9 turns.\n\n            But note: the problem says minimal H. So if we can do in 9 turns, that's best.\n\n            How to get to 9 in 9 turns? we must go up every time.\n\n            But we have to check: if we go up every time, we will be:\n\n                turn 6: at (0,0) -> safe (row0)\n                then we take action U at turn 6 -> leads to (0,1) at turn 7.\n\n                At turn 7: we are at row1 -> freeway1. Is freeway1 dangerous at turn7? \n\n                    We computed: freeway1 has no dangerous turns in [6,26] -> safe.\n\n                Then action U at turn7 -> turn8: row2 -> freeway2: dangerous at [14,15]? turn8 is 8 -> not in [14,15] -> safe.\n\n                Then U at turn8: row3 -> freeway3: dangerous at [14,15] -> safe at turn9.\n\n                Then U at turn9: row4 -> freeway4: dangerous at [14,15] -> safe at turn10? (turn10 is 10, which is not in [14,15]) -> safe.\n\n                Then U at turn10: row5 -> freeway5: dangerous at turn6 only -> safe at turn11? \n                Then U at turn11: row6 -> freeway6: dangerous at turn6 only -> safe at turn12?\n                Then U at turn12: row7 -> freeway7: dangerous at turn6 only -> safe at turn13?\n                Then U at turn13: row8 -> freeway8: dangerous at turns 6 and 10 -> turn13: 13 not in {6,10} -> safe.\n                Then U at turn13: leads to row9 at turn14? \n\n                But wait: at turn13 we are at row8? Then we take U at turn13 -> then at turn14 we are at row9.\n\n                Then at turn14: we are at row9 -> safe.\n\n                But we want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn? which turn? \n\n                We started at turn6. We took 8 actions? \n\n                Actions: turn6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 -> 8 actions -> so H=8? \n\n                Then the state at the beginning of turn14 is (0,9). So we have reached at turn14? \n\n                But the problem requires: at turn t1+H-1 = 6+8-1 = 13? \n\n                We are at (0,9) at turn14, which is after 8 actions? \n\n                How many actions: \n                    turn6: action -> leads to turn7: row1\n                    turn7: action -> leads to turn8: row2\n                    ...\n                    turn13: action -> leads to turn14: row9.\n\n                So at the beginning of turn14, we are at row9. \n\n                But the problem requires to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 6+8-1 = 13? \n\n                That is not the case.\n\n            Alternatively, if we count the state at the beginning of turn6 as step0, then:\n\n                We have states:\n                  turn6: row0\n                  turn7: row1\n                  turn8: row2\n                  turn9: row3\n                  turn10: row4\n                  turn11: row5\n                  turn12: row6\n                  turn13: row7\n                  turn14: row8\n                  turn15: row9   -> we want to be at row9 at turn15.\n\n                Then we have taken 9 actions: from turn6 to turn14 (9 actions) -> H=9.\n\n                Then we are at row9 at turn15, and the problem requires at turn t1+H-1 = 6+9-1 = 14? \n\n                But we are at row9 at turn15, not turn14.\n\n            This indicates a confusion.\n\n            The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n            How many turns have passed? \n\n                We start at turn t1 (6). Then we take H actions: at turn6, turn7, ... , turn6+H-1.\n\n                Then the state after the last action is at turn6+H.\n\n                But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n            So we require that at the beginning of turn6+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n            How many actions have been taken by the beginning of turn6+H-1?\n\n                We have taken actions at turns: 6, 7, ..., 6+H-2 -> H-1 actions.\n\n            Therefore, we must have achieved (0,9) in H-1 actions? \n\n            But from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 upward moves? so H-1 >= 9 -> H>=10.\n\n            However, that seems inconsistent.\n\n            Let me check the problem statement again: \n                \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n                and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n            Example: H=1: \n                sequence: {a_{6}} -> one action at turn6.\n                then at turn6+H-1 = 6+1-1=6: we are at the state at the beginning of turn6? but we haven't taken the action yet? \n\n            Alternatively, the action taken at turn t1+t is applied at turn t1+t, and then the state at the next turn (t1+t+1) is updated.\n\n            And we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\n            Then:\n\n                For t from 0 to H-1: we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n                Then the state at turn t1+H is the state after the last action.\n\n                But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\n            How to achieve that?\n\n                We start at turn t1 (6) at (0,0). \n                We require at turn t1+H-1 (6+H-1) to be at (0,9).\n\n                How many actions have we taken by then? \n                    We take actions at turns: 6, 7, ... , 6+H-2? because the last action we take is at turn6+H-2 to affect the state at turn6+H-1.\n\n                So we have taken H-1 actions.\n\n                Therefore, we must be able to go from 0 to 9 in H-1 actions.\n\n                Minimal H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\n                Then the sequence has 10-1 = 9 actions? \n\n                But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1 (which is 0 to 9) -> 10 actions.\n\n            This is confusing.\n\n            Let me try with a small example: \n                Suppose we want to be at (0,9) at turn 6 (t1=6) -> then H-1=0 -> H=1. \n                Then the sequence is {a_{6}} (one action) but then we haven't moved? \n\n            Alternatively, the problem might mean that after taking the actions up to a_{t1+H-1}, the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\n            How?\n\n                We start at turn6: (0,0).\n                We take action a_6 at turn6 -> then at turn7 we are at (0, y7). \n                ...\n                We take action a_{6+H-1} at turn6+H-1 -> then at turn6+H we are at (0, y_{6+H}).\n\n                But we require that at turn6+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n                This means that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn6+H-1? and then we take an action at turn6+H-1? but that action might move us away? \n\n                The problem doesn't say we have to stay, it only says \"reach\" at that turn.\n\n            However, note: the player update: at turn6+H-1, we are at (0, y_{6+H-1}) at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action a_{6+H-1} which may change the row.\n\n            But the problem requires that at turn6+H-1, we are at (0,9). This means at the beginning of turn6+H-1, we must be at (0,9).\n\n            Therefore, we do not take an action at turn6+H-1? \n\n            But the sequence includes a_{t1+H-1} = a_{6+H-1}. \n\n            So we must take an action at turn6+H-1, which will move us from (0,9) to (0,10) or (0,8) or (0,9) (if we choose S) at turn6+H.\n\n            The requirement is only to reach at turn6+H-1, not to stay.\n\n            So it is acceptable to leave immediately.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal H: we need to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn6+H-1, which means we need to take actions from turn6 to turn6+H-2 (H-1 actions) to get to (0,9) at turn6+H-1.\n\n            Then we take the last action (the H-th action) at turn6+H-1, but that doesn't affect the state at turn6+H-1.\n\n            So we require: after H-1 actions, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn6+H-1.\n\n            Therefore, minimal H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\n            Then the sequence has 10 actions: a_6, a_7, ..., a_15.\n\n            And we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn6+10-1 = 15.\n\n            Then we output the first 9 actions? \n\n            But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so we output all 10 actions. However, note that after the 9th action (at turn14) we are at (0,9) at turn15? \n\n            How the indexing works:\n\n                turn6: start at (0,0) -> then take a_6 -> leads to (0,y7) at turn7.\n                ...\n                turn14: take a_14 -> leads to (0,y15) at turn15.\n\n            We want at the beginning of turn15 to be at (0,9). So the action at turn14 must be chosen such that it leaves us at 9? or moves to 9 from 8? \n\n            But note: we are at the beginning of turn15: that is after the action at turn14.\n\n            Therefore, we require that the action at turn14 moves us to 9.\n\n            So the entire sequence of 10 actions must get us to (0,9) at turn15.\n\n            How many moves upward? 9 upward moves and one extra action. The extra action could be S at the end? \n\n            But we can also reach earlier and then wait? \n\n            However, minimal H is 10.\n\n            But wait, can we do it in fewer? \n\n            We start at (0,0) at turn6. We want to be at (0,9) at turn15 (which is 9 turns later) -> but we have 9 actions (from turn6 to turn14) to move up 9 times -> then we can be at (0,9) at turn15.\n\n            So we need 9 upward moves and then one more action (the 10th) at turn15? but the sequence is defined for turns 6 to 15? \n\n            The problem: the sequence is a_{6} to a_{15} (if H=10).\n\n            And we are at (0,9) at turn15 (the beginning of turn15) -> then we take an action a_{15} at turn15? which might move us, but that's fine.\n\n            However, the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn15? but the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\" = 6+10-1=15.\n\n            So it matches.\n\n            Therefore, we need to simulate until turn15.\n\n            But note: the collision condition: we must not be on a freeway row at a turn when it is dangerous.\n\n            In the upward-only path:\n\n                turn6: at (0,0) -> safe.\n                turn7: at (0,1) -> freeway1: safe (not dangerous at turn7)\n                turn8: at (0,2) -> freeway2: safe (turn8 not in [14,15])\n                turn9: at (0,3) -> freeway3: safe\n                turn10: at (0,4) -> freeway4: safe\n                turn11: at (0,5) -> freeway5: dangerous at turn6 only -> safe at turn11.\n                turn12: at (0,6) -> freeway6: dangerous at turn6 only -> safe.\n                turn13: at (0,7) -> freeway7: dangerous at turn6 only -> safe.\n                turn14: at (0,8) -> freeway8: dangerous at turns 6 and 10 -> turn14 is 14, which is not in {6,10} -> safe.\n                turn15: at (0,9) -> safe.\n\n            So the upward-only path works in 10 actions.\n\n            Actions: 9 times U and then one more action at turn15? but we only care about the state at turn15 (which is the beginning of turn15) and we are at 9.\n\n            However, the sequence of actions must be specified for turns 6 to 15.\n\n            For the upward-only path: \n                a6 = U\n                a7 = U\n                a8 = U\n                a9 = U\n                a10 = U\n                a11 = U\n                a12 = U\n                a13 = U\n                a14 = U   -> this gets us to 9 at turn15.\n                then a15 = ? -> we don't care, but we have to output an action for turn15? \n\n            But wait, the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning for the H actions. \n\n            We have H=10 actions: a6 to a15.\n\n            We are at (0,9) at turn15 (the beginning of turn15) and then we take a15. \n\n            The requirement is only to be at (0,9) at turn15, so a15 can be anything? \n\n            But note: after taking a15, we move to turn16. We don't care about turn16.\n\n            However, we must avoid collision at turn15: at turn15, we are on row9 (safe) so a15 can be U, D, or S.\n\n            But the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n            Since we are at the goal at turn15, we can choose any action for the last one. To be safe, we can choose S.\n\n            But note: the minimal H is 10, and the upward-only path works.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is:\n\n                Turn 6: U\n                Turn 7: U\n                Turn 8: U\n                Turn 9: U\n                Turn 10: U\n                Turn 11: U\n                Turn 12: U\n                Turn 13: U\n                Turn 14: U\n                Turn 15: S   (or U, but then we go to 10 which is clamped to 9? no, because at y=9, U -> 9+1=10 -> clamped to 9? \n                    The update: y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t + 1) = 9.\n\n                So we can choose U for turn15 as well.\n\n            However, the problem does not require us to stay, so we can choose any.\n\n            Let's choose S for the last one.\n\n            But wait: is there a solution with H<10? \n\n            H=10 is minimal because we need at least 9 upward moves and then one more action to satisfy the sequence of H actions and the turn index.\n\n            Therefore, we output:\n\n                Turn 6: U\n                Turn 7: U\n                Turn 8: U\n                Turn 9: U\n                Turn 10: U\n                Turn 11: U\n                Turn 12: U\n                Turn 13: U\n                Turn 14: U\n                Turn 15: S\n\n            But note: the turn15 action is the 10th action, and we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn15. Then we take S, and then at turn16 we are still at 9.\n\n            However, the requirement is only to be at 9 at turn15 (the beginning), so this is valid.\n\n        However, what if there is a path that takes exactly 9 actions (H=9) and we are at (0,9) at turn14? \n\n            That would be better.\n\n            But then we would be at (0,9) at turn14 = t1+9-1 = 6+8 = 14? \n\n            How? \n\n                We start at turn6: (0,0). \n                We take 9 actions: a6 to a14.\n\n                Then the state at turn15 is the result of a14.\n\n                We require to be at (0,9) at turn14? \n\n                But at turn14, we are at the state after a13? \n\n                So after 8 actions (a6 to a13) we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn14? then we take a14 at turn14, and then at turn15 we might move.\n\n                But the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn14 -> which is the beginning of turn14.\n\n                Then we have taken 8 actions: from turn6 to turn13.\n\n                Then the sequence for H=9 would be a6 to a14 (9 actions), and we are at (0,9) at turn14.\n\n                Is that possible? \n\n                We need to move from 0 to 9 in 8 upward moves? -> impossible.\n\n            Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found a solution with H=10.\n\n        However, we must verify that the upward path is safe for all the turns we are on the freeways.\n\n        We did:\n\n            turn7: row1 -> safe? freeway1: dangerous_set = {} -> safe.\n            turn8: row2 -> freeway2: dangerous at [14,15] -> turn8 not in -> safe.\n            turn9: row3 -> freeway3: dangerous at [14,15] -> safe.\n            turn10: row4 -> freeway4: dangerous at [14,15] -> safe.\n            turn11: row5 -> freeway5: dangerous_set = {6} -> turn11 not 6 -> safe.\n            turn12: row6 -> freeway6: {6} -> safe.\n            turn13: row7 -> freeway7: {6} -> safe.\n            turn14: row8 -> freeway8: {6,10} -> turn14=14 -> not in -> safe.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we output the sequence:\n\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: S   (or U or D, but S is safe and doesn't move)\n\n        However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=10.\n\n        But is there a solution with H=10 that is not upward all the time? \n\n        However, upward all the time is minimal in terms of number of moves: we use 9 moves to go up and then one move to do nothing.\n\n        So we are done.\n\n        But note: what if we go up faster? we can't.\n\n        However, what if we go up and then down and then up? that would take more turns.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are doing 10 actions. Is there a solution with fewer actions? \n\n        We argued that we need at least 9 upward moves and then one more action to satisfy the sequence of H actions and the turn index. So minimal H is 10.\n\n        Therefore, we output the upward path.\n\n        However, note: at turn15 we are at row9, and then we take action S. But the problem does not require to stay, so we could output only the first 9 actions? \n\n        But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1 -> H actions. And we set H=10.\n\n        So we must output 10 actions.\n\n        Alternatively, if we set the last action to be anything, we choose S.\n\n        But note: if we choose U at turn15, then we go to 10 -> clamped to 9. Then at turn16 we are at 9. But we are only required to be at 9 at turn15.\n\n        So both are fine.\n\n        We choose S.\n\n        Let me write the answer:\n\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: S\n\n        But wait: the last action (Turn15) is at turn15, and we are at row9 at the beginning of turn15. Then we take S, and then at turn16 we are still at row9.\n\n        And the requirement is only at turn15.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"avoiding collisions\" at every turn. At turn15, we are on row9 (safe) and then we take S -> no collision.\n\n        Therefore, it is valid.\n\n        But note: the car update: at turn15, we are on row9 -> no car check. Then we take S -> no change.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, what if we try to use a different path? For example, if we wait at row0 for one turn? \n\n        Then:\n\n          turn6: row0 -> safe.\n          turn6: action S -> then turn7: row0.\n          then we start moving up.\n\n          We would need 9 upward moves from turn7 to turn15 -> then we are at row9 at turn16? \n\n          But we require to be at row9 at turn15 (if we want H=10, then at turn15 we must be at row9). \n\n          How?\n\n            turn6: S -> turn7: row0.\n            turn7: U -> turn8: row1.\n            turn8: U -> turn9: row2.\n            ...\n            turn14: U -> turn15: row8.\n            turn15: U -> turn16: row9.\n\n          Then at the beginning of turn15, we are at row8 -> and then we take U to get to row9 at turn16.\n\n          But we require to be at row9 at the beginning of turn15? -> not satisfied.\n\n          So we would need to be at row9 at turn15: then we must have 9 upward moves by turn14.\n\n          If we wait one turn, then we start at turn7, and we need to be at row9 by turn15: that's 8 upward moves -> not enough.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot wait.\n\n        So upward every turn is the fastest.\n\n        But note: what if there is a freeway that is dangerous at one of the turns we pass? \n\n          We already checked: upward path is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we output the upward path.\n\n        However, let me double-check freeway8 at turn14: \n            freeway8: dangerous at turns 6 and 10.\n            turn14: not 6 or 10 -> safe.\n\n        And the others are safe.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But wait: the freeway8 at turn14: we are at row8 at turn14? \n\n          turn14: state at the beginning of turn14: we are at row8? \n          Then we take U at turn14 -> then at turn15 we are at row9.\n\n          And freeway8 is dangerous at turn14? we said no.\n\n        How did we compute freeway8?\n\n            It has two cars:\n\n                car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> \n                    T_low = ceil(6 - (-48)/12) = ceil(6+4)=ceil(10)=10\n                    T_high = floor(6 - (-59)/12)=floor(6+59/12)=floor(6+4.916)=10.916 -> floor=10 -> so [10,10] -> only turn10.\n                car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [6,6] (only turn6)\n\n            So dangerous_set for freeway8 = {6,10}\n\n            turn14 not in -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: S\n\n        But note: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we are to output for turns t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1.\n\n        We have H=10, so we output for turns 6 to 15.\n\n        Format:\n\n            Turn 6: a_{6} = U\n            Turn 7: a_{7} = U\n            ...\n            Turn 15: a_{15} = S\n\n        In the box.\n\n        However, the problem says: \n            \\boxed{\n            Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n            Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n            ...\n            }\n\n        So:\n\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: S\n\n        We write:\n\n            \\boxed{\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: S\n            }\n\n        But note: the last action is S, but we could also do U or D? \n\n        The problem does not specify, so we choose S.\n\n        However, to be consistent, we can choose any. But S is the most natural.\n\n        Let me choose S.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=10. \n\n        But what if we can do it in 9 actions? \n\n            We would be at (0,9) at turn14 (the beginning of turn14) -> then we take an action at turn14, and then we are at turn15.\n\n            How to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn14? \n\n                We start at turn6:0.\n\n                Then we need to be at 9 by the beginning of turn14 -> that is 8 actions (from turn6 to turn13) to move from 0 to 9? \n\n                We need 9 upward moves, but we only have 8 actions? -> impossible.\n\n            Therefore, H cannot be 9.\n\n        So H=10 is minimal.\n\n        We output the answer.\n\n        But note: the car on freeway5,6,7 are dangerous at turn6, but we are not on those freeways at turn6. We are on row0 at turn6.\n\n        And at turn11,12,13 we are on row5,6,7 -> which are safe at those turns.\n\n        So the path is valid.\n\n        We are confident.\n\n        Code for precomputation (to be sure) for freeway8 at turn10: \n            freeway8 at turn10: \n                car1: (-48,-59,right,12) at turn10: \n                    left_end = -59 + 12*(10-6) = -59 + 48 = -11\n                    right_end = -48 + 48 = 0\n                    so the car spans [-11,0] -> so 0 is included? \n                Therefore, freeway8 at turn10 is dangerous.\n\n            We computed T=10 for car1 -> correct.\n\n        But we are not on freeway8 at turn10.

The sequence of actions moves the player upward every turn until reaching row 9 at turn 15 (the beginning of turn 15).

The current turn is t1=12, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the data. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], where t1 is the current turn, which is 12.\n\nThe collision happens at turn T if I'm on a freeway y at that turn, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, note that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, and since the grid is from y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but I need to be at (0,9), which is probably the end point.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8. So when I'm at y=9, I shouldn't worry about cars, but I need to get there.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe zones, I assume.\n\nBut at turn T, if I'm on y=0, no collision, similarly for y=9.\n\nBut I start at y=0 at t=12, and I need to end at y=9.\n\nNow, actions: U (up) increases y by 1, D (down) decreases by 1, S (stay) keeps y same.\n\ny is vertical, so moving up increases y, down decreases y.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=0, I can't go down, similarly at y=9, can't go up, but since I'm going to 9, it should be fine.\n\nNow, cars: let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3)\n\nSince right-moving, span at time T: [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [37 + 3(T-12), 48 + 3(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59? Head and tail, for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller, but here h=-48, τ=-59, so tail is more negative, so head is at -48, tail at -59? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read the car update.\n\nFor right-moving: [τ, h] meaning tail to head, with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nIn freeway 2: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nBut if it's right-moving, and head is at position, say x, but in the span, it's given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail.\n\nHere, head = -48, tail = -59, so tail = -59 < head = -48, so that's fine.\n\nSo span at t1=12: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span = [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [-59 + 6(T-12), -48 + 6(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 6) same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nAll same?\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12)\n\nSecond car: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nYes.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nNow, I need to find when a car has 0 in its span for a given freeway at a given turn T.\n\nCollision if for that freeway at turn T, 0 is in [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check for each car.\n\nAlso, I will be on a freeway only when y_t = k for k=1 to 8.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=12 onwards.\n\nAt t=12, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action a_{12}, which determines y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy, but y_{13} is position at turn 13.\n\nPosition at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on action.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if I am on a freeway y_t between 1 and 8, and for that y_t, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nThe span at time t is defined for each car.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns the freeway is occupied at x=0, meaning 0 in some car's span.\n\nThen, I must avoid being on that freeway at those turns.\n\nSince I can control when I arrive at each y, I need to sequence my moves.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nSet ΔT = T - 12, so time since turn 12.\n\nFor freeway 1: car: [37 + 3ΔT, 48 + 3ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 3ΔT\n\nSo 37 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 => 3ΔT ≤ -37 => ΔT ≤ -37/3 ≈ -12.333, but ΔT = T-12, and T≥12, so ΔT ≥0, so 37 + 3ΔT ≥37>0, so 37 + 3ΔT ≤0 is impossible. Similarly, 0 ≤48 +3ΔT always true since 48+3ΔT≥48>0. So for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span for ΔT≥0. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let me check.\n\n37 + 3ΔT ≤0 only if ΔT ≤ -12.333, not possible for T≥12. And 0 ≤48+3ΔT always true, but for 0 to be in [low, high], we need low ≤0 and 0≤ high, but here low =37+3ΔT ≥37>0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low, high] since low>0. So yes, for freeway 1, x=0 is never occupied for T≥12. So I can be on freeway 1 at any time without collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car with [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +6ΔT\n\nSo -59 +6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤59 => ΔT ≤ 59/6 ≈9.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +6ΔT => 48 ≤6ΔT => ΔT ≥ 48/6 =8\n\nSo for 8 ≤ ΔT ≤ 9.833, since ΔT integer, ΔT=8 or 9.\n\nT=12+8=20 or 12+9=21.\n\nAt T=20, ΔT=8: low = -59 +6*8 = -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included? 0 ≤ high, and low ≤0, yes, 0 is in [ -11, 0 ].\n\nAt T=21, ΔT=9: low= -59+54= -5, high= -48+54=6, so [ -5,6], 0 is in it.\n\nFor ΔT=10: low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied at x=0 at turns T=20 and T=21.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car parameters, so also occupied at T=20,21.\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied T=20,21.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) so [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 37+12ΔT ≤0 ≤48+12ΔT\n\n37+12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤ -37 => ΔT ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, not possible for ΔT≥0.\n\n0≤48+12ΔT always true.\n\nBut low=37+12ΔT ≥37>0, so 0 not in [low,high], always safe for first car.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) so head=0, tail=-11? At t1=12.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0] since right-moving, I think.\n\nCar update: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] then at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for this car, τ=-11, h=0, s=12.\n\nAt T, span: [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -11 +12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤11 => ΔT ≤ 11/12 ≈0.916, so for ΔT=0 only? ΔT integer, so ΔT=0: T=12.\n\nAt ΔT=0, low= -11 +0 = -11, high=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt ΔT=1, low= -11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=12, for this car, 0 is in span.\n\nBut T=12 is the current turn, and I am not on freeway 5 at turn 12, I am at y=0.\n\nAt turn T=12, for freeway 5, there is a car with span including 0, but since I am not on freeway 5, no collision.\n\nFor later times, only at T=12 it is occupied.\n\nNow for freeway 5, first car is never occupied at 0, second car only at T=12.\n\nSo freeway 5 is occupied only at T=12, but since we start at T=12, and I am not on it, for T>12, it should be safe? At T=12, occupied, but I am not there. For T=13 onwards, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same cars, so same as freeway 5, occupied only at T=12 at x=0.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied only at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) so τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [-59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12ΔT ≤0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59+12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤59 => ΔT ≤59/12≈4.916, so ΔT≤4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT => 48 ≤12ΔT => ΔT ≥4\n\nSo for ΔT=4, T=16\n\nAt ΔT=4: low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=3: low= -59+36= -23, high= -48+36= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=5: low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=16 for first car.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) same as before, span: [-11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span only at ΔT=0, T=12.\n\nSo for freeway 8, at T=12, second car occupied at 0, but I am not on it.\n\nAt T=16, first car occupied at 0.\n\nOther times, not occupied.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when x=0 is occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: never\n\nFreeway 2: T=20,21\n\nFreeway 3: T=20,21\n\nFreeway 4: T=20,21\n\nFreeway 5: only T=12 (but not relevant since we start later)\n\nFreeway 6: only T=12\n\nFreeway 7: only T=12\n\nFreeway 8: T=12 (second car) and T=16 (first car)\n\nT=12 is now, so for future turns, freeway 8 occupied only at T=16.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=12 to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1 per turn, so minimum H is 9 turns, since from 0 to 9, 9 steps up.\n\nBut I might need to stay or go down to avoid collisions, so H might be more.\n\nSince freeway 1 is always safe, I can go directly to y=1 and be safe anytime.\n\nBut I need to go through all y.\n\nThe critical points are freeways 2,3,4 at T=20,21 and freeway 8 at T=16.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=16 occupied.\n\nNow, let me list the freeways and their unsafe times:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=20,21\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=20,21\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=20,21\n\ny=5: always safe (after t=12)\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=16\n\ny=5,6,7 are always safe except at t=12, but t=12 is past, so for t>12, safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=16 only.\n\ny=2,3,4 unsafe at t=20,21.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe player position: I start at t=12, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nI need net +9 in y.\n\nThe minimal turns would be if I go up every turn, so from t=12 to t=20, 8 turns later, y=8? Let's see.\n\nAt t=12, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at t=12, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy.\n\nIf I do U at t=12, y_{13} = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt t=13, if U, y_{14}=2, and so on.\n\nAfter k up moves, I reach y=k at turn t=12+k.\n\nPosition at turn t: if I start moving at t=12.\n\nAt turn t=12, I am at y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, y_{13} set.\n\nSo at turn t=13, I am at y_{13}, and so on.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, that means I arrived there at turn T, so y_T =9.\n\nThe sequence: from t=12 to t=12+H-1, actions, and at turn t=12+H-1, y=9.\n\nt from 12 to 12+H-1, so number of actions is H.\n\nStart at t=12, after H actions, at turn t=12+H, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe turn when position is defined: at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at t=12, y_{12} =0.\n\nI choose a_{12}, which sets y_{13}.\n\nThen at t=13, I choose a_{13}, sets y_{14}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=12+H, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nThe last action is at t=12+H-1, which sets y_{12+H}.\n\nAnd at that turn, y_{12+H}=9.\n\nThe minimal H is 9, if I go up every turn: a_t = U for t=12 to 20, then at t=21, y=9.\n\nt=12: a12=U, y13=1\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=2\n\n...\n\nt=20: a20=U, y21=9? Let's see: from t=12 to t=20, that's 8 actions: t=12 to t=19 actions set y13 to y20.\n\ny at turn t:\n\nt=12: y=0\n\nt=13: y=1 (after a12=U)\n\nt=14: y=2 (after a13=U)\n\n...\n\nt=20: y=8 (after a19=U)\n\nThen at t=20, I need to set y21, so if a20=U, y21=9.\n\nSo at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions: from t=12 to t=20.\n\nt=12 to t=20 inclusive? Actions at t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20? That's 9 actions.\n\nAction at t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo actions: t=12: set y13\n\nt=13: set y14\n\n...\n\nt=20: set y21\n\nSo after 9 actions, y21=9.\n\nNow, I need to check for each turn when I am on freeway, if collision.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=k at turn t=12+k for k=1 to 8? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=13, y=1, freeway 1\n\nt=14, y=2, freeway 2\n\nt=15, y=3, freeway 3\n\nt=16, y=4, freeway 4\n\nt=17, y=5, freeway 5\n\nt=18, y=6, freeway 6\n\nt=19, y=7, freeway 7\n\nt=20, y=8, freeway 8\n\nThen t=21, y=9, not freeway.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=13, y=1, freeway 1: always safe, no issue.\n\nt=14, y=2, freeway 2: unsafe at t=20 and 21, but t=14 is before, safe. Freeway 2 unsafe only at t=20,21, so at t=14, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=15, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe at t=20,21, so t=15 safe.\n\nt=16, y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at t=20,21, so t=16 safe.\n\nt=17, y=5, freeway 5, always safe after t=12, and t=17>12, safe.\n\nt=18, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=19, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nt=20, y=8, freeway 8: unsafe at t=16? t=16 is for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=16.\n\nAt t=20, y=8, freeway 8: is it unsafe?\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe times: we have at t=16, and also at t=12 but t=12 past.\n\nAt t=16, freeway 8 occupied at x=0.\n\nIn this path, at t=20, I am on y=8.\n\nIs freeway 8 occupied at t=20?\n\nFrom above, freeway 8: only unsafe at t=16. At t=20, should be safe.\n\nEarlier for freeway 8, we have cars: first car occupied only at t=16, second car only at t=12.\n\nSo at t=20, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=21, y=9, not freeway.\n\nBut in this path, I am on freeway 2 at t=14, which is safe since unsafe only at t=20,21.\n\nt=14 is fine.\n\nThe problem is that at t=20 and t=21, freeways 2,3,4 are occupied, but in this path, I am not on them at those times.\n\nAt t=20, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, but freeway 8 is safe at t=20, only unsafe at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, at t=21, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nSo this path seems collision-free.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe t=20,21\n\nIn path: on y=2 at t=14, which is not 20 or 21, so ok.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=16 unsafe, but in path, on y=8 at t=20, not t=16.\n\nt=16, in this path, where am I?\n\nAt t=16, y=4? Let's see:\n\nt=12: y=0\n\nt=13: y=1\n\nt=14: y=2\n\nt=15: y=3\n\nt=16: y=4 (freeway 4)\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4, which is unsafe at t=20,21, but t=16 is safe, since only unsafe at 20,21.\n\nFreeway 4: we said unsafe at t=20,21.\n\nAt t=16, freeway 4 is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=16: occupied, but at t=16, I am on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with 9 actions: all U from t=12 to t=20, I reach y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=12 to t=20, 9 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions starting from t_1, which is 12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\n...\n\nup to Turn 20: U\n\nThen at turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H=9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so t=12 to 12+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, y at t=12+H.\n\nSet t=12+H = T, y_T=9.\n\nH = T - 12.\n\nMinimal T is 21, so H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? That would mean reaching at t=20.\n\nIf I go up every turn from t=12 to t=19, that's 8 actions.\n\ny at t=13:1, t=14:2, ..., t=20:8? Actions: a12 sets y13=1, a13 sets y14=2, ..., a19 sets y20=8.\n\nThen at t=20, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=20, I need y20=9.\n\nThat means at t=19, I was at y=8 or 9, but if at t=19 y=8, and a19=U, then y20=9.\n\nBut at t=20, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision issue, but I need to be on freeways during the path.\n\nIn this case, with H=8 actions: a12 to a19.\n\na12: U, y13=1\n\na13: U, y14=2\n\n...\n\na18: U, y19=8? Let's list:\n\nAfter a12 at t=12: y13=1\n\nAfter a13 at t=13: y14=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a18 at t=18: y19=8? t=18 action sets y19.\n\nStart: t=12, y12=0\n\na12: U, y13=1\n\na13: U, y14=2\n\na14: U, y15=3\n\na15: U, y16=4\n\na16: U, y17=5\n\na17: U, y18=6\n\na18: U, y19=7? I think I miscount.\n\nt=12: after a12, y13=1\n\nt=13: after a13, y14=2\n\nt=14: after a14, y15=3\n\nt=15: after a15, y16=4\n\nt=16: after a16, y17=5\n\nt=17: after a17, y18=6\n\nt=18: after a18, y19=7\n\nt=19: after a19, y20=?\n\nIf a19=U, y20=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y20=9, I need y19=8 or 9.\n\nBut from above, after a18, y19=7, so at t=19, y=7.\n\nThen a19=U, y20=8.\n\nStill not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=20, I need y20=9, which requires y19=9 and a19=S, or y19=8 and a19=U, or y19=9 and a19=D, but D decreases, so only if y19=8 or 9.\n\nBut from y12=0, in 7 actions, I can reach at most y19=7, since each action increases by at most 1, from t=12 to t=19, 7 turns later?

No, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't, since only one step per turn.\n\nUnless I start from y=0, but I need to move up.\n\nAnother thing: at y=0, I can stay, but that would delay, not help.\n\nOr go down, but y=0 is bottom, can't go down.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 5,6,7, at t=12, there was a car at x=0, but since I am not on it, fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, all actions are U.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=12, H=9, so t=12 to 20.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=9.\n\nBut is there a reason to have a different sequence? For example, to avoid something, but in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=20 with some detour, but impossible, as above.\n\nUnless I am at y=9 earlier, but from y=0, minimum 9 steps to y=9.\n\ny13=1, y14=2, ..., y21=9, so 9 steps, t=21.\n\nIf I could jump, but no.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, but in freeway 8, there is a car at t=16, but I don't need to be there.\n\nBut in this path, I am not affected.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2,3,4 at t=20,21, if I were on them, but I am not.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me list the actions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen at turn 21, position (0,9)\n\nIn the sequence, up to turn 20 action.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut is there any problem at turn 16?\n\nAt turn 16, in this sequence, I am at y=4 (since at t=16, y=4).\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4, which is unsafe only at t=20,21, so at t=16, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 is unsafe at t=16, but I am on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the car state for freeway 5,6,7 has cars at t=12, but not later.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5, at t=12, there is a car with head=0, tail=-11, so at t=12, span [-11,0], so x=0 occupied.\n\nBut at t=12, I am at y=0, not on freeway 5, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path by going to y=9 faster, but impossible.\n\nOr maybe stay at some point to avoid, but no need.\n\nFor example, at t=20, if I were on y=2,3,4, it would be bad, but I am not.\n\nIn this path, at t=20, I am on y=8, which is fine.\n\nAt t=21, I reach y=9.\n\nBut H=9 actions.\n\nThe minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach with H=8 by going to higher y earlier, but no, since I start from 0.\n\nUnless I start moving down, but at y=0, I can't go down, only S or U.\n\nIf I do S at some point, it delays.\n\nFor example, if I do S at t=12, then y13=0, then I need to go to 9 from there, which takes at least 9 more actions, so H larger.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, can't.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 8, there is a car at t=16, and freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nBut I don't need to be there at t=16.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at any point I might be at risk.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the note says: if I move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, since I move step by step, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nIf y_{T+1} != y_T, then at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so if there is a car on y_{T+1} at turn T, it doesn't affect me.\n\nIn this path, for instance, at t=20, I am on y=8, freeway 8, which is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps at t=16, when freeway 8 is occupied, but I am on y=4.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the solution.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and I do.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, it starts from t_1, which is 12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nWith H=9.\n\nBut in the box, I need to write it.\n\nPerhaps I can write it compactly, but I think list each turn.\n\nSince all same, but better to list.\n\nNow, but in freeway 5,6,7, at t=12, occupied, but not relevant.\n\nAnother point: for freeway 1, I assumed always safe, but let me confirm.\n\nFreeway 1: car (48,37,right,3), at T, span [37+3ΔT, 48+3ΔT], min at ΔT=0 is 37 to 48, both positive, increasing, so always x>0, never 0, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4: cars with s=6, and at t=20,21 occupied.\n\nt=20: ΔT=8, for freeway 2: car [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so includes 0.\n\nt=21: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd at those times, I am not on them.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at t=16: ΔT=4, car [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] for first car, and second car only at t=12.\n\nSo occupied at t=16.\n\nBut in path, not on it.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all up actions.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 12 to turn 20, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 21.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Always safe for \\(T \\geq 12\\), as the car span \\([37 + 3(T-12), 48 + 3(T-12)]\\) never contains 0 (minimum x=37 at T=12, increasing).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe at T=20 and T=21. In the path, the player is on y=2 at T=14, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe at T=20 and T=21. Player is on y=3 at T=15, safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe at T=20 and T=21. Player is on y=4 at T=16, safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Safe for \\(T > 12\\) (occupied only at T=12). Player is on y=5 at T=17, safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Safe for \\(T > 12\\) (occupied only at T=12). Player is on y=6 at T=18, safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Safe for \\(T > 12\\) (occupied only at T=12). Player is on y=7 at T=19, safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at T=16 (occupied), but player is on y=8 at T=20, where it is safe (span at T=20 is [37,48] for first car and [85,96] for second car, neither contains 0).\n\nThe player moves directly upward without delay, minimizing \\(H\\). No shorter path exists, as reaching y=9 requires at least 9 upward moves from y=0.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t = 12\\) to \\(t = 20\\) (9 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=18 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the freeway you're currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=18, and for future turns, they move based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars will be at each future turn relative to x=0.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (48, 37, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the span at turn T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. Head h=48, tail τ=37? The notation says for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], so here τ=37, h=48? I think I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nLooking back: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, increasing x.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). So head h=48, tail τ=37, direction right.\n\nSince it's right-moving, at turn t1=18, span is [τ, h] = [37, 48].\n\nThen at turn T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 3(T-18), 48 + 3(T-18)]\n\nSimilarly, for collision, we care when 0 is in this interval.\n\n0 in [37 + 3(T-18), 48 + 3(T-18)]?\n\nSet 37 + 3(T-18) ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 3(T-18)\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span is increasing.\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 3(T-18) ≤ 0\n\n3(T-18) ≤ -37\n\nT-18 ≤ -37/3 ≈ -12.333, so T ≤ 18 - 13.333? Since T integer, T-18 ≤ -13? Let's calculate properly.\n\n37 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 18\n\n3ΔT ≤ -37\n\nΔT ≤ -37/3 = -12.333, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ -13\n\nSimilarly, upper bound: 0 ≤ 48 + 3ΔT\n\n48 + 3ΔT ≥ 0? 0 ≤ 48 + 3ΔT implies 3ΔT ≥ -48, ΔT ≥ -16\n\nBut we need both:\n\nLower bound: 37 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 → 3ΔT ≤ -37 → ΔT ≤ floor(-37/3) = floor(-12.333) = -13?

For ΔT >=0, 37 + 3ΔT >=37 >0, so lower bound >0, thus 0 < lower bound, so 0 not <= upper bound? Let's see the inequality.\n\nThe span is [L, U] = [37 + 3ΔT, 48 + 3ΔT]\n\nFor 0 to be in [L,U], need L <= 0 <= U.\n\nL = 37 + 3ΔT >=37 >0 for ΔT >=0, so L >0, thus 0 < L <= U, so 0 not >= L, so 0 not in interval for any ΔT >=0.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT <0, we had T=2 to5, but that's past, not future.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at any T >=18, L =37 +3ΔT >=37>0, so 0 not in span, no collision possible at freeway 1 for T>=18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 6ΔT, -48 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -59 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +6ΔT <=0 → 6ΔT <=59 → ΔT <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so ΔT <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6ΔT → 48 <=6ΔT → ΔT >= 48/6=8\n\nSo for ΔT=8,9\n\nT=18+8=26, 18+9=27\n\nSo collision at T=26 and 27.\n\nΔT=8: L= -59 +6*8= -59+48= -11, U= -48+48=0\n\n0 <= U=0, yes, and L=-11 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nSimilarly ΔT=9: L=-59+54= -5, U=-48+54=6, so 0 in [-5,6]\n\nYes.\n\nΔT=10: L=-59+60=1, U=-48+60=12, 1 to12, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 2 has collision at T=26 and 27.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2?

L=37+12ΔT >0 for ΔT>=0, so no.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) head h=0, tail τ=-11, right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -11+12ΔT <=0 <= 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -11+12ΔT <=0 → 12ΔT <=11 → ΔT <=11/12<1, so ΔT<=0\n\nSecond: 0 <=12ΔT → ΔT >=0\n\nSo only ΔT=0, T=18.\n\nAt T=18, span is [-11,0], and 0 is included, so collision at T=18 if on freeway 5.\n\nBut we start at turn 18, position (0,0), which is on y=0, not on freeway 5. Freeway 5 is y=5, I assume? Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer is at (0,0) at turn 18, so on y=0, not on any freeway, so no collision at start.\n\nFor future, at T=18, if player were on y=5, collision, but not.\n\nFor T>18, ΔT>0, L= -11+12ΔT, for ΔT=1, L=1, U=12, 0 not in [1,12]. Similarly higher, no. So only possible at T=18, but not on freeway, so freeway 5 second car only dangerous at T=18, but not for us since we start moving later.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 6: | 6 | \\((48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\\) | same as 5.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same.\n\nNow freeway 8: \\((-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\\)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) head h=-48, tail τ=-59, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -59+12ΔT <=0 <= -48+12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59+12ΔT <=0 → 12ΔT <=59 → ΔT <=59/12≈4.916, so ΔT<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12ΔT → 12ΔT >=48 → ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT=4, T=18+4=22\n\nAt ΔT=4, L=-59+48= -11, U=-48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=5: L=-59+60=1, U=-48+60=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=22.\n\nSecond car on freeway 8: (0,-11,right,12), same as before, span at T: [-11+12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in it only if ΔT=0, T=18, as before.\n\nBut at T=18, not on freeway.\n\nFor T>18, no collision from this car.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: no collision possible for T>=18\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at T=26,27\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2, collision at T=26,27\n\n- Freeway 4: same, T=26,27\n\n- Freeway 5: first car no issue, second car only at T=18, not relevant. So no collision for T>18\n\n- Freeway 6: same as 5, no issue\n\n- Freeway 7: same, no issue\n\n- Freeway 8: first car collision at T=22, second car no issue. So collision at T=22.\n\nFreeway 8 has collision at T=22.\n\nAlso freeways 2,3,4 at T=26,27.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at turn 18.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when there is a collision on that freeway.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on freeway 2,3, or 4 at turn 26 or 27, collision.\n\n- If on freeway 8 at turn 22, collision.\n\n- Other freeways and times are safe.\n\nAlso, since we move one y per turn, to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum turns is 9, if we go up each turn.\n\nBut we need to avoid the collision times.\n\nLet me denote the turn number from start: let t=0 be turn t1=18, so at time t=0, position y=0.\n\nThen at time t, turn is t1 + t = 18 + t.\n\nPosition y_t.\n\nWe need to find actions for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{H-1} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, and after H-1 actions, at turn t1 + H-1, position should be (0,9).\n\nAnd we start at t=0, turn t1=18, position (0,0).\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t1 + t, we move to position at turn t1 + t +1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nIn this case, T = t1 + t for some t.\n\nSince we start at T=t1=18, and we consider turns from T=18 onwards.\n\nFor simplicity, let τ = T - t1, so τ=0 is turn 18.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ is applied, leading to y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision at time τ if y_τ = k for some k=1 to8, and freeway k has a car with 0 in span at turn t1 + τ.\n\nSince t1=18, turn is 18 + τ.\n\nNow, from earlier, dangerous times:\n\nFreeway 2: collision at τ such that 18 + τ =26 or 27, so τ=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 8: collision at τ such that 18+τ=22, so τ=4.\n\nOther freeways safe at all times.\n\nSo, to avoid collision:\n\n- If y_τ = 2,3, or 4 at τ=8 or 9, collision.\n\n- If y_τ = 8 at τ=4, collision.\n\n- Otherwise safe.\n\nNow, we need to go from y_0 =0 to y_H =9 for some H, with actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time τ=H, position y_H=9.\n\nτ from 0 to H: at τ=0, y=0; after a_0, y_1, ..., after a_{H-1}, y_H=9.\n\nAnd collision checked at each τ from 0 to H? At each turn, when we are at y_τ, if y_τ in 1-8, check collision.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, not on freeway, no collision.\n\nAt τ=H, if y_H=9, which is not a freeway (freeways 1-8), so no collision.\n\nWe only care about τ where y_τ in 1-8.\n\nNow, minimal H to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum possible is 9 turns, going up each time: y_τ = τ for τ=0 to9, but y_9=9.\n\nBut need to check if at any τ, y_τ causes collision.\n\ny_τ = τ.\n\nNow, collision points:\n\nAt τ=4, y_4=4. But freeway 4 is dangerous only at τ=8,9? Freeway 4 collision at τ=8,9 when y=4? No.\n\nFreeway 4 has collision if on freeway 4 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4, which is freeway 4, but collision only at specific times.\n\nFor freeway 4, collision only at τ=8 and 9.\n\nAt τ=4, no collision for freeway 4, since only dangerous at τ=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, y=4, freeway 4, but is there a car? From earlier, freeway 4 has a car that is dangerous only at τ=8,9. At τ=4, let's verify.\n\nFreeway 4 car: at τ=0 (turn 18), span [-59,-48] for the car? Freeway 4: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nAt τ, ΔT=τ, span: [-59 +6τ, -48 +6τ]\n\nAt τ=4, L= -59+24= -35, U= -48+24= -24, both negative, 0 not in, so no collision at τ=4 for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, only at τ=8,9.\n\nNow, for y_τ=τ, so at τ=8, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at τ=4? τ=4, y=4, not freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, if on freeway 8, collision.\n\nBut in this path, at τ=4, y=4, which is freeway 4, not 8.\n\nFreeway 4 is safe at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=8, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nIs freeway 8 dangerous at τ=8?\n\nFreeway 8: we have two cars, but first car dangerous at τ=4? τ=4 for freeway 8.\n\nAt τ=8, what about freeway 8?\n\nFreeway 8: first car (-48,-59,right,12), dangerous at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=8, span: ΔT=8, L= -59 +12*8= -59+96=37, U= -48+96=48, so [37,48], 0 not in, no.\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,12), at τ=8, span [-11+96, 96] = [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 8 safe at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=8, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nNow at τ=8, y=8, but we have collision issue for freeways 2,3,4 at τ=8,9.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=8, which is not 2,3,4, so no problem.\n\nAt τ=9, y=9, which is not freeway, no collision.\n\nIn this path, y_τ=τ, from τ=0 to9.\n\nCheck collisions:\n\nτ=0: y=0, safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, freeway 1. Freeway 1: no danger, safe.\n\nτ=2: y=2, freeway 2. At τ=2, freeway 2 car: span [-59+12, -48+12]? Freeway 2 speed 6, ΔT=τ=2.\n\nL= -59 +6*2= -59+12= -47, U= -48+12= -36, both neg, 0 not in, safe. Danger only at τ=8,9.\n\nSimilarly τ=3: y=3, freeway 3, same as above, span at τ=3: L=-59+18= -41, U=-48+18= -30, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=4, freeway 4, span L=-59+24= -35, U=-48+24= -24, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=5, freeway 5. Freeway 5 cars: first (48,37,right,12) span at τ: [37+12τ,48+12τ], at τ=5, [37+60=97,48+60=108], no. Second car (0,-11,right,12) span [-11+60,60]= [49,60], no 0. Safe.\n\nτ=6: y=6, freeway 6, similar, safe.\n\nτ=7: y=7, freeway 7, similar, safe.\n\nτ=8: y=8, freeway 8. As above, safe at τ=8.\n\nτ=9: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut at τ=8 and 9, freeways 2,3,4 have collisions, but we are not on them, so fine.\n\nIn this path, we never are on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time.\n\ny_τ=τ, so at τ=8, we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly τ=9, y=9.\n\nSo actually, with 9 actions, we can reach y=9 at τ=9, with no collisions.\n\nBut is that correct? τ=9, y=9, which is the end.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8 at τ=4: we are at y=4, not on freeway 8, so no issue.\n\nAnd freeways 2,3,4 at τ=8,9: we are at y=8 and y=9, not on them.\n\nSo yes, we can go directly up in 9 turns.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) at turn 18, and after 9 actions, at turn 18+9=27, position (0,9).\n\nAnd at turn 27, for freeways 2,3,4, there is collision, but we are at y=9, not on freeway, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12) which at turn 18 has span including 0, but we are not on freeway at start.\n\nIn the path, we are on freeway 5 at τ=5, turn 23, which is fine.\n\nSo minimal H should be 9.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; we need to output the actions.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Or can we do it faster?\n\nMinimum is 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\nWe could go down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nOr stay, but that increases H.\n\nSo 9 is minimum possible.\n\nBut perhaps at some point we need to avoid, but in this case, no need.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, turn 22, freeway 8 has collision, as we said.\n\nBut in the path, at τ=4, we are on y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 at τ=4 is safe, as span not including 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5,6,7, the second car (0,-11,right,12) at τ=0 has span [-11,0], including 0, but at τ=0, we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nSo I think H=9 is achievable with all U actions.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn t1 + t for t=0 to 8? Actions from τ=0 to τ=8.\n\nAt each turn, from turn 18 to turn 26, we move up, reaching y=9 at turn 27.\n\nLet's specify.\n\nAt turn 18 (τ=0), position (0,0), we choose action, say U, then at turn 19, position (0,1)\n\nSimilarly, at turn 19, action U, to (0,2) at turn 20.\n\n...\n\nAt turn 26, position (0,8)? Let's see:\n\nStart: turn 18, y=0\n\nAfter a_18 (action at turn 18), to y_19\n\nGenerally, at turn T, after action, position at turn T+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, we output action a_T.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=18.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 18, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (at turn 18), to turn 19, y=1.\n\nAfter second action (turn 19), to turn 20, y=2.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 18+k, y=k.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 18+k, so k=9, after 9 actions, at turn 27, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 18 to turn 26 inclusive, that's 9 actions: t=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26.\n\nThen at turn 27, y=9.\n\nNow, during this, we are at freeway y at turn 18+y for y=1 to8.\n\nTurn when on freeway k: at turn 18 + k, since y=k at turn 18+k.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1 at turn 19 (τ=1)\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 20 (τ=2)\n\n...\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 26 (τ=8)\n\nNow, dangerous times:\n\nFor freeway 2: collision at turn 26 and 27? Turn 26 is τ=8, turn 27 is τ=9.\n\nAt turn 26, if on freeway 2, collision? Freeway 2 collision at τ=8 and 9, which is turn 26 and 27.\n\nAt turn 26, if we are on freeway 2, but in our path, at turn 26, we are on freeway 8, since y=8 at turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 27, we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo not on freeway 2 at turn 26 or 27.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at turn 22 (τ=4).\n\nAt turn 22, in our path, we are at y=4? Turn 22 is τ=4, since τ=0 turn 18, τ=1 turn 19, ..., τ=4 turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, position: after actions up to turn 21.\n\nStart turn 18, y=0\n\nAfter a18=U, turn 19 y=1\n\na19=U, turn 20 y=2\n\na20=U, turn 21 y=3\n\na21=U, turn 22 y=4\n\nSo at turn 22, we are at (0,4), on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 8 is dangerous at turn 22, but we are not on it.\n\nFreeway 4 at turn 22: τ=4, freeway 4 car span: as before, L=-59+6*4= -59+24= -35, U=-48+24= -24, not include 0, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo with all U actions, we reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it faster? No, because we need to increase y by 9, each action can increase by at most 1, so minimum 9 actions.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start from 0.\n\ny=0 to y=9, 9 steps up.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nBut perhaps there is a constraint I missed.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 22, freeway 8 has collision, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 26 and 27, freeways 2,3,4 have collisions, but we are on y=8 and then y=9, not on them.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let's check freeway 5,6,7 at the times we are on them.\n\nFor example, on freeway 5 at turn 23: τ=5, turn 23.\n\nFreeway 5 cars: first car span [37+12*5,48+12*5]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108], no.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12*5, 12*5]=[-11+60,60]=[49,60], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I need to output for each turn from t1 onwards.\n\nSo for turn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nThen at turn 27, position (0,9), done.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, so 9 actions, turns 18 to 26.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be on a freeway when collision happens.\n\nFor example, suppose at some turn we stay or down, but we don't.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at τ=4, turn 22, if we were on y=8, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, we avoid all dangers.\n\nMaybe we can go slower to avoid, but no need, and it would take more turns.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 5,6,7: there is a car at (0,-11,right,12) which at turn 18 has span including 0, but we are not on freeway at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 19, we are on y=1, not 5,6,7.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nBut the task is to find minimal H, which is 9.\n\nBut is there a way with less? No.\n\nPerhaps by going down first, but that would increase the number of steps.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0, but we are already, or below, but y min 0, so can't go below.\n\nStay, but that adds turns.\n\nSo 9 is minimum.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut let's output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\n}\n\nAfter turn 26 action U, at turn 27, y=9.\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it says {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at turn t1 + t.\n\nt=0: turn 18, a18\n\nt=1: turn 19, a19\n\n...\n\nt=8: turn 26, a26\n\nAfter that, at turn 27, position.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd we reach at turn 27.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and at turn 27 we are there.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at turn 27, freeways 2,3,4 have collision, but we are at y=9, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1, but no danger.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, it says (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), and for (0,-11), at turn 18, span is [ -11, 0] if right-moving? Head h=0, tail τ=-11, right, so span [τ, h] = [-11, 0], yes, includes 0 at turn 18.\n\nBut at turn 18, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nAt other turns, not including 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, at turn 22, the first car has span including 0, but we are not on y=8 then.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9 with all up actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Dangerous Freeways and Turns\n- **Freeway 2, 3, and 4**: Each has a car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 6)\\) that causes collisions at turns 26 and 27 (relative to \\(t_1 = 18\\), \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Has a car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\) that causes a collision at turn 22 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- All other freeways (1, 5, 6, 7) are safe at all turns for \\(T \\geq 18\\), as no car spans include \\(x = 0\\) at relevant times.\n\nThe minimum number of turns to move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 9, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve a \\(\\Delta y = 9\\).\n\n### Path Validation\nA sequence of 9 consecutive \"U\" actions, starting at turn 18, results in the following positions:\n- Turn 18: Action U → position at turn 19: (0, 1)\n- Turn 19: Action U → position at turn 20: (0, 2)\n- Turn 20: Action U → position at turn 21: (0, 3)\n- Turn 21: Action U → position at turn 22: (0, 4)\n- Turn 22: Action U → position at turn 23: (0, 5)\n- Turn 23: Action U → position at turn 24: (0, 6)\n- Turn 24: Action U → position at turn 25: (0, 7)\n- Turn 25: Action U → position at turn 26: (0, 8)\n- Turn 26: Action U → position at turn 27: (0, 9)\n\nCollision checks at each turn:\n- **Turn 18 (\\(y = 0\\))**: Not on a freeway; safe.\n- **Turn 19 (\\(y = 1\\))**: Freeway 1 has no collision at any turn; safe.\n- **Turn 20 (\\(y = 2\\))**: Freeway 2 collision only at turns 26–27; safe at turn 20.\n- **Turn 21 (\\(y = 3\\))**: Freeway 3 collision only at turns 26–27; safe at turn 21.\n- **Turn 22 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 collision only at turns 26–27; safe at turn 22. Freeway 8 collision at turn 22, but player is on freeway 4, not freeway 8.\n- **Turn 23 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 has no collision for \\(T > 18\\); safe.\n- **Turn 24 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 has no collision for \\(T > 18\\); safe.\n- **Turn 25 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 has no collision for \\(T > 18\\); safe.\n- **Turn 26 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 collision only at turn 22; safe at turn 26.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 24, and I'm given the positions of cars on each freeway at this turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given head (h), tail (τ), direction (d), and speed (s) at turn t_1. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving, but in the update, left-moving has span [h, τ] decreasing, and right-moving has [τ, h] increasing? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving cars: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at turn T > t_1, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Since it's left-moving, h and τ should be such that h > τ or something? In the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], with ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (h, τ, d, s). I need to interpret the direction.\n\nLooking at freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). Since direction is right, and it says \"right-moving\", so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48]? But it says head and tail, so probably head is the front.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. So for right-moving, τ is the tail (left end), h is the head (right end), so at t_1, the car occupies from τ to h, and since it's moving right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but if it's left-moving, h should be greater than τ, I assume, so that when it decreases, it moves left.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). Since right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48]. At time T, it will be [37 + 3*(T-24), 48 + 3*(T-24)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if there was one, but in this case, all seem to be right-moving except possibly some.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 37, right, 3) → so right-moving, span at t_1: [37, 48]\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) → direction right, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, h is head. But -59 is less than -48, so [-59, -48] makes sense for a car moving right.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo for freeway 2: τ = -59, h = -48, s=6, so at t_1, span [ -59, -48 ]\n\nAt T, [ -59 + 6*(T-24), -48 + 6*(T-24) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 6) — this might be a typo? It says (-48, -59, right, 6), but if direction right, span should be [τ, h] = [-59, -48]. But it's listed as head -48, tail -59, which is consistent if tail is left.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: right, span [37, 48] at t_1\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12), so τ = -11, h=0, so span at t_1: [-11, 0]\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same as 5? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) → spans [37,48] and [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) → first car span [-59,-48], second car span [-11,0]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 (the x-position) is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nImportant point: when the player moves, at turn T, if they move to y_{T+1}, they are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so at turn T, they are on y_T, and only check cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for collision, it says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\nSo at each turn T, we look at the player's y-coordinate y_T, and for that freeway, if there is a car with 0 in its span at time T, then collision.\n\nSince the player starts at (0,0) at t_1=24, and y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9).\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at turn 24.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 9 times, but I can stay or move down, but since I need to increase y, moving down might not help, but I have to avoid cars, so I might need to wait or something.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I start at y=0, end at y=9, and each U increases y by 1, each S or D doesn't help to increase, so to minimize turns, I should always move up if possible, but I have to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nBut I might need to stay or move down to wait for a car to pass.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway, when the cars are at position x=0.\n\nBecause collision happens only if at turn T, on freeway y, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find the times when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThen, for the player to be on that freeway at that time, it would be a collision.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nSince the player moves one step per turn, I need to simulate the path.\n\nBut first, let's compute for each freeway the dangerous times.\n\nDefine ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 24.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, so no left-moving in this case.\n\nAll directions are right, so all are right-moving cars.\n\nSo for any car, 0 ∈ [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSo -τ/s ≥ ΔT and ΔT ≥ -h/s? Let's solve.\n\nFrom τ + s ΔT ≤ 0: s ΔT ≤ -τ ⇒ ΔT ≤ -τ/s (since s>0)\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s ΔT: s ΔT ≥ -h ⇒ ΔT ≥ -h/s\n\nSo ΔT must satisfy: -h/s ≤ ΔT ≤ -τ/s\n\nNow, since h and τ could be negative or positive, we need to compute for each car.\n\nΔT = T - 24, so T = 24 + ΔT.\n\nNow let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ=37, h=48, s=3, direction right.\n\nSo ΔT min: -h/s = -48/3 = -16\n\nΔT max: -τ/s = -37/3 ≈ -12.333, so -12.333? But ΔT must be integer since turns are discrete, I assume.\n\nT is integer turn, so ΔT integer.\n\n-48/3 = -16 exactly, -37/3 = -12.333, so ΔT ≥ ceil(-h/s) and ΔT ≤ floor(-τ/s)? Let's see.\n\nΔT must satisfy: -h/s ≤ ΔT ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince ΔT integer, we need to find integer ΔT such that ceil(-h/s) ≤ ΔT ≤ floor(-τ/s)? No.\n\nFrom inequality: ΔT ≥ ceil(-h/s) ? Not necessarily, because -h/s may not be integer.\n\nFor example, -h/s = -48/3 = -16 exactly, so ΔT ≥ -16\n\n-τ/s = -37/3 ≈ -12.333, so ΔT ≤ -12.333, since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ -13? No.\n\nΔT ≤ -τ/s = -37/3 ≈ -12.333, so ΔT ≤ -13 because -13 < -12.333, and -12 > -12.333? -12 > -12.333, so ΔT ≤ -13? Let's think numerically.\n\n-τ/s = -37/3 = -12.333, so ΔT ≤ -12.333, meaning ΔT must be less than or equal to -12.333, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ -13? No, -13 = -13.0 < -12.333, and -12 = -12.0 > -12.333, so ΔT ≤ -13? But -13 < -12.333, and inequality is ΔT ≤ -12.333, so for ΔT = -13, -13 ≤ -12.333 true, ΔT = -12, -12 ≤ -12.333? -12 > -12.333, so false. So ΔT must be <= -13? That can't be right.\n\nΔT ≤ -τ/s = -37/3 ≈ -12.333\n\nΔT <= -12.333 means ΔT <= -13 since -13 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -12.333? No, less than or equal to -12.333.\n\nIntegers less than or equal to -12.333 are -13, -14, etc., but -13 = -13.0 < -12.333, and -12 = -12.0 > -12.333, so only ΔT <= -13? But at ΔT = -13, let's check the inequality.\n\nThe condition is τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nFor ΔT = -13, τ + s ΔT = 37 + 3*(-13) = 37 - 39 = -2 <= 0 true\n\n0 <= h + s ΔT = 48 + 3*(-13) = 48 - 39 = 9, 0 <=9 true, so yes.\n\nΔT = -12, τ + s ΔT = 37 + 3*(-12) = 37 - 36 =1 >0, so τ + s ΔT =1 >0, so 0 <=1? 0 <=1 is true, but τ + s ΔT <=0 is false because 1>0, so 0 is not less than or equal to τ + s ΔT when it's greater.\n\nThe span is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT], so 0 in span iff τ + s ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= h + s ΔT.\n\nFor ΔT = -12, τ + s ΔT =37 +3*(-12)=37-36=1 >0, so 1 <= 0 is false, so not satisfied.\n\nΔT = -13, τ + s ΔT =37-39= -2 <=0 true, h + s ΔT=48-39=9 >=0 true.\n\nΔT = -16, τ + s ΔT=37+3*(-16)=37-48=-11<=0, h + s ΔT=48-48=0<=0 true, 0<=0.\n\nΔT = -17, τ + s ΔT=37-51=-14<=0, h + s ΔT=48-51=-3<0, so 0 <= -3 false.\n\nSo for freeway 1 car, 0 in span when ΔT from -16 to -13 inclusive.\n\nΔT = -16, -15, -14, -13.\n\nT = 24 + ΔT, so T=24-16=8, 9,10,11? ΔT = T - 24, so for ΔT=-16, T=24-16=8, ΔT=-15, T=9, etc. up to ΔT=-13, T=11.\n\nBut t_1=24 is current turn, so for T<24, it's in the past, but for the player, we care about future turns from T=24 onwards.\n\nFor collision, we care about when the player is on the freeway at that time, so for future turns.\n\nFor freeway 1, the car is at x=0 only at T=8,9,10,11, which are before t_1=24, so for T>=24, no danger on freeway 1, since the car has moved on.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: car (-48,-59,right,6), so τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nΔT min: -h/s = -(-48)/6 = 48/6 =8\n\nΔT max: -τ/s = -(-59)/6 =59/6≈9.833\n\nSo ΔT >= ceil(8) =8? -h/s = -(-48)/6 =48/6=8 exactly\n\nΔT <= -τ/s = -(-59)/6=59/6≈9.833\n\nSo ΔT <=9.833, so ΔT <=9 since integer? ΔT <=9.833, so ΔT=8,9\n\nΔT >=8 and ΔT <=9.833, so ΔT=8,9\n\nFor ΔT=8: τ + s ΔT = -59 +6*8 = -59+48= -11 <=0 true, h + s ΔT= -48 +48=0 <=0 true\n\nΔT=9: τ + s ΔT= -59+54= -5<=0, h + s ΔT= -48+54=6>=0 true\n\nΔT=10: τ + s ΔT= -59+60=1>0, not <=0, so not\n\nSo at T=24+8=32 and T=24+9=33, 0 is in span for freeway 2 car.\n\nT=32 and 33.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48,-59,right,6) — in the table, freeway 3 has the same car: (-48,-59,right,6), so same as freeway 2, dangerous at T=32,33.\n\nBut freeway 3 is different row, but same parameters, so yes.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, (-48,-59,right,6), so T=32,33.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) so τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nΔT min: -h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\nΔT max: -τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nSo ΔT >= -4 and ΔT <= -3.083, so ΔT <= -4? ΔT <= -3.083, so ΔT <= -4 since -4 < -3.083, -3 > -3.083? Similar issue.\n\nΔT >= -4, ΔT <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nΔT integer: ΔT = -4, -4 <= -3.083 true? -4 < -3.083, and inequality ΔT <= -3.083, so for ΔT=-4, -4 <= -3.083 true, but -3.083 is about -3.083, -4 < -3.083, so yes.\n\nΔT = -3, -3 <= -3.083? -3 > -3.083, so false.\n\nNow check: ΔT = -4, τ + s ΔT =37 +12*(-4)=37-48=-11<=0, h + s ΔT=48-48=0<=0 true\n\nΔT = -3, τ + s ΔT=37+12*(-3)=37-36=1>0, not <=0\n\nSo only ΔT=-4, T=24-4=20, which is past.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (0,-11,right,12) so τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nSpan at t_1: [-11,0] since right-moving, [τ, h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 +12 ΔT, 0 +12 ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12 ΔT <= 0 <= 0 +12 ΔT\n\nSo 0 <= 12 ΔT always true since s>0, and -11 +12 ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12 ΔT <=11 ⇒ ΔT <= 11/12 ≈0.916\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT <= 0\n\nAlso, from 0 <= 12 ΔT, since 12 ΔT, 0 <= 12 ΔT implies ΔT >=0? 12 ΔT >=0, so ΔT >=0.\n\n0 <= 12 ΔT implies 12 ΔT >=0, so ΔT >=0.\n\nAnd -11 +12 ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12 ΔT <=11 ⇒ ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so ΔT <=0 since integer.\n\nSo ΔT >=0 and ΔT <=0, so ΔT=0.\n\nThus at ΔT=0, T=24+0=24.\n\nAt T=24, span is [-11+0, 0+0] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, since it's the head.\n\nSo for freeway 5, second car, dangerous at T=24.\n\nFirst car not dangerous in future.\n\nSo freeway 5 dangerous at T=24 only.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car same as before, only dangerous at T=20, past.\n\nSecond car: same, dangerous at T=24.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, dangerous at T=24 for second car.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nΔT min: -h/s = -(-48)/12 =48/12=4\n\nΔT max: -τ/s = -(-59)/12=59/12≈4.916\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4.916, so ΔT=4\n\nΔT=4: τ + s ΔT = -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11<=0, h + s ΔT= -48+48=0<=0 true\n\nΔT=5: τ + s ΔT= -59+60=1>0, not\n\nSo dangerous at T=24+4=28\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), same as before, dangerous at T=24.\n\nSo for freeway 8, dangerous at T=24 (from second car) and T=28 (from first car).\n\nNow summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: no danger for T>=24\n\n- Freeway 2: danger at T=32,33\n\n- Freeway 3: danger at T=32,33\n\n- Freeway 4: danger at T=32,33\n\n- Freeway 5: danger at T=24\n\n- Freeway 6: danger at T=24\n\n- Freeway 7: danger at T=24\n\n- Freeway 8: danger at T=24 and T=28\n\nPlayer starts at turn 24 at y=0. At turn 24, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision. But if the player moves to y=1 at turn 24, then at turn 24, they are on y=0 when they move, but let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the player has position y_T, and we check for collision on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nAt turn 24, player is at (0,0), y=0, not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nThen the player chooses action a_{24}, which determines y_{25}.\n\nAction at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nFrom player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t is taken, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut at turn t, the position is y_t, and we check collision based on y_t and cars at turn t.\n\nSo for turn T, position y_T, check if on freeway (y=1 to 8) and if 0 in span for that freeway at T.\n\nNow, at T=24, y_24=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen, after action a_24, y_25 is set.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, and we need to cross freeways 1 to 8.\n\nMinimal turns: since from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 up moves, so H at least 9 turns, with all U actions.\n\nBut we might need to insert S or D to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up in 9 turns.\n\nStart at turn 24, y=0.\n\nAfter turn 24, action a_24, then y_25.\n\nIf a_24 = U, y_25=1\n\nThen at turn 25, y=1, position (0,1), so on freeway 1.\n\nNow, is freeway 1 dangerous at T=25? From above, freeway 1 has no danger for T>=24, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=2 at turn 26, on freeway 2 at T=26.\n\nFreeway 2 dangerous at T=32,33, not 26, so safe.\n\nBut let's list the path.\n\nAssume all U actions.\n\nTurn 24: action a_24, then y_25 = y_24 + Δy_24 = 0 +1 =1 if U\n\nAt turn 24: y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 25: y=1, on freeway 1. Freeway 1 safe at T=25, since no danger.\n\nTurn 26: action a_25, say U, y_26=2, on freeway 2 at T=26. Freeway 2 dangerous only at 32,33, so safe.\n\nTurn 27: a_26 U, y_27=3, freeway 3 at T=27. Safe, since danger at 32,33.\n\nTurn 28: a_27 U, y_28=4, freeway 4 at T=28. Freeway 4 dangerous at 32,33, not 28, safe.\n\nTurn 29: a_28 U, y_29=5, freeway 5 at T=29. Freeway 5 dangerous only at T=24, not 29, safe.\n\nTurn 30: a_29 U, y_30=6, freeway 6 at T=30. Freeway 6 dangerous only at T=24, safe.\n\nTurn 31: a_30 U, y_31=7, freeway 7 at T=31. Freeway 7 dangerous at T=24, safe at 31.\n\nTurn 32: a_31 U, y_32=8, freeway 8 at T=32. Now freeway 8 dangerous at T=24 and T=28. T=32 is not dangerous? T=24 and T=28, but T=32 not listed, so should be safe? But let's confirm.\n\nFreeway 8: danger at T=24 (from second car) and T=28 (from first car).\n\nAt T=32, first car: at T=28 it was at span, but at T=32, ΔT=32-24=8, for first car τ=-59, h=-48, s=12, span [ -59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], so 0 not in [37,48], safe.\n\nSecond car: at T=32, ΔT=8, span [-11 +12*8, 0 +12*8] = [-11+96, 96] = [85,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo freeway 8 safe at T=32.\n\nThen turn 33: a_32 U, y_33=9, on y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\ny_33=9 at turn 33.\n\nNow, at turn 33, position (0,9), reached.\n\nBut we started at turn 24, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions: actions from t=24 to t=32, 9 actions, y from 0 to 9 in 9 turns.\n\nTurn 24: action a_24, y_25=1\n\nTurn 25: a_25, y_26=2\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 32: a_32, y_33=9\n\nSo at turn 33, y=9.\n\nActions from t=24 to t=32 inclusive, that's 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, with t_1=24, so a_{24} to a_{24+H-1}, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=24 to t=24+H-1, actions, then y_{24+H} is set.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nStart at turn 24, y_24=0.\n\nAfter first action a_24, y_25 set to new y.\n\nIf we do U at each step, y_25=1, y_26=2, ..., y_33=9.\n\nSo at turn 33, y=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn 33.\n\nThe number of actions H: from t=24 to t=32, actions at 9 turns, H=9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{24 + H -1}\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\ny_{24 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=9, y_{24+9-1}=y_{32}, but y_32=8 if we go up, not 9.\n\ny_{24 + H -1} =9.\n\nStart: at t=24, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=24 + H, y= something.\n\nAfter k actions, we have applied k actions, and y_{24+k} is the position after k actions.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y_24=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=24), y_25.\n\nAfter 2 actions (t=24 and 25), y_26.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{24+k}\n\nSet y_{24+k} =9.\n\nSince we start from 0, and each U increases by 1, minimum k=9, so y_{24+9}=y_{33}=9.\n\nThus, with H=9 actions, from t=24 to t=32, we can reach y_33=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_t for t=24 to 32, that's 9 actions.\n\nIn the path above, with all U, we can reach without collision.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point we are on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time.\n\nIn the path:\n\nTurn 24: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\nAction a_24=U, y_25=1\n\nTurn 25: y=1, on freeway 1 at T=25. Freeway 1 not dangerous at T=25, safe.\n\nAction a_25=U, y_26=2\n\nTurn 26: y=2, freeway 2 at T=26. Dangerous times 32,33, not 26, safe.\n\nAction a_26=U, y_27=3\n\nTurn 27: y=3, freeway 3 at T=27. Safe, danger at 32,33.\n\nAction a_27=U, y_28=4\n\nTurn 28: y=4, freeway 4 at T=28. Freeway 4 dangerous at 32,33, not 28, safe.\n\nAction a_28=U, y_29=5\n\nTurn 29: y=5, freeway 5 at T=29. Freeway 5 dangerous only at T=24, not 29, safe.\n\nAction a_29=U, y_30=6\n\nTurn 30: y=6, freeway 6 at T=30. Safe, danger only at 24.\n\nAction a_30=U, y_31=7\n\nTurn 31: y=7, freeway 7 at T=31. Safe.\n\nAction a_31=U, y_32=8\n\nTurn 32: y=8, freeway 8 at T=32. As above, not dangerous, safe.\n\nAction a_32=U, y_33=9\n\nTurn 33: y=9, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and reached in 9 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut is there a problem? What about freeway 8 at T=28? In this path, at T=28, we are on y=4, freeway 4, not freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 is dangerous at T=24 and T=28.\n\nAt T=24, we are at y=0, not on freeway 8.\n\nAt T=28, in this path, we are on y=4, freeway 4, not freeway 8, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, other dangers are avoided.\n\nSo it seems possible with H=9, all U.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 dangerous at T=24: at T=24, we are at y=0, not on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 and 7 dangerous only at T=24, same.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at T=24 and T=28.\n\nT=24: y=0, safe.\n\nT=28: in path, y=4, not on 8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nt_1=24.\n\nActions: for turn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 32: a_{32} = U\n\nThen at turn 33, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=9, t_1=24, so actions at turns 24 to 32.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = U\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = U\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = U\n\nTurn 29: a_{29} = U\n\nTurn 30: a_{30} = U\n\nTurn 31: a_{31} = U\n\nTurn 32: a_{32} = U\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 8 at T=28.\n\nIn the path, at T=28, we are not on freeway 8, so fine.\n\nPerhaps we can do it faster? But since we need to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 up moves, and we did it in 9 turns with no waiting, so minimal.\n\nIf we move down or stay, it would take more turns, so this should be minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there is any constraint that forces us to wait.\n\nFor example, at turn 24, if we go to y=1 immediately, it's fine.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would delay reaching y=9.\n\nSimilarly, moving down doesn't help.\n\nSo H=9 with all U seems correct.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, at T=24, there is a car at [ -11,0] for the second car, so at T=24, on freeway 5,6,7, if player is there, collision, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, at T=28, dangerous, but in our path, we are not there.\n\nBut just to confirm, if we were on freeway 8 at T=28, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=28, we are on y=4.\n\nT=28: turn 28, y_28=4.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position at each turn to verify.\n\nTurn 24: y=0, action U\n\nTurn 25: y=1, action U\n\nTurn 26: y=2, action U\n\nTurn 27: y=3, action U\n\nTurn 28: y=4, action U\n\nTurn 29: y=5, action U\n\nTurn 30: y=6, action U\n\nTurn 31: y=7, action U\n\nTurn 32: y=8, action U\n\nTurn 33: y=9\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nT=24: y=0, no freeway, safe\n\nT=25: y=1, freeway 1, no danger, safe\n\nT=26: y=2, freeway 2, danger at 32,33, not 26, safe\n\nT=27: y=3, freeway 3, similar, safe\n\nT=28: y=4, freeway 4, danger at 32,33, not 28, safe\n\nT=29: y=5, freeway 5, danger only at 24, not 29, safe\n\nT=30: y=6, freeway 6, similar, safe\n\nT=31: y=7, freeway 7, similar, safe\n\nT=32: y=8, freeway 8, not dangerous at 32, as computed, safe\n\nT=33: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U for turns 24 to 32.\n\nNow, in the boxed answer.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nWith t_1=24.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\n\nAnd that's 9 lines.\n\nt_1 to t_1 + 8, since t_1 + (H-1) =24 +8=32.\n\nH=9, so from t=24 to t=24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player must move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 9 upward moves (U actions) since each U increases \\(y\\) by 1, and S or D actions would increase the number of turns.\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- The dangerous times for each freeway (when a car occupies x=0) are:\n  - Freeway 1: No danger for \\(T \\geq 24\\).\n  - Freeway 2: Danger at \\(T = 32, 33\\).\n  - Freeway 3: Danger at \\(T = 32, 33\\).\n  - Freeway 4: Danger at \\(T = 32, 33\\).\n  - Freeway 5: Danger at \\(T = 24\\).\n  - Freeway 6: Danger at \\(T = 24\\).\n  - Freeway 7: Danger at \\(T = 24\\).\n  - Freeway 8: Danger at \\(T = 24\\) and \\(T = 28\\).\n\nA sequence of 9 consecutive U actions from turn 24 to turn 32 achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 9\\)) without collisions:\n- At turn 24: Player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=30 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t1=30, with head and tail, direction, and speed. I need to check for collisions at each turn when the player is on a freeway y=1 to 8. Collision happens if at that turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on for collision.\n\nThe player position is updated at each turn, and after moving, if y is between 1 and 8, we check for collision with cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at t1, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t1=30:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=3. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [37,48] at t1.\n\nDirection right: span at t1 is [τ, h] = [37,48], so head is at 48, tail at 37, meaning it extends from 37 to 48.\n\nSimilarly, for movement: right-moving, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all seem right-moving except I need to check.\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,3) — head=48, tail=37? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail? Let me read the car update.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for freeway 1: head=48, tail=37, direction=right. Since direction is right, the span is [tail, head] = [37,48], I think, because for right-moving, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] with head left, tail right, but in this case, all cars here are right-moving except let's see.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=3. So span at t1: [37,48] since right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span: [37 + 3(T-30), 48 + 3(T-30)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6). Head=-48, tail=-59, direction right. Since right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so tail=-59, head=-48, so span at t1: [ -59, -48 ]\n\nAt T: [ -59 + 6(T-30), -48 + 6(T-30) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48,-59,right,6) — identical to freeway 2? But different freeways, so separate.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-48,-59,right,6), same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48,-59,right,6), again same.\n\nThat seems odd, but possible, I guess. Cars can be at same positions on different freeways.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12, span at t1: [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=12, span at t1: [-11,0]? Tail=-11, head=0, so [ -11, 0 ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12) — yes.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, right, so span [ -59, -48 ]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, span [ -11, 0 ]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at turn t1=30. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so at turn 30, position (0,0), no collision possible since y=0 has no cars.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), which is also not a freeway, so when we are at y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, so we need to pass through these rows without colliding.\n\nThe player moves at each turn: we choose action U, D, or S, which changes y for the next position.\n\nAfter each action, we have a new position at turn t+1.\n\nThe sequence is for turns starting from t1: actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to when we reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and position should be (0,9).\n\nDefine the turns carefully.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nWe choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and if y_{t+1} is between 1 and 8, we check for collision with cars on that freeway at turn t+1.\n\nThe collision check is at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if y_T is in {1,2,...,8}, then we need that for all cars on freeway y_T, 0 is not in their span at turn T.\n\nThe span is at turn T.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t1=30, y=0.\n\nWe choose a_{30}, which will move us to y_{31} at turn 31.\n\nThen at turn 31, if y_{31} in 1-8, check collision.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach a turn where y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and we can only change by -1,0,+1, the minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, then after 9 ups, y=9.\n\nBut we might hit cars or need to avoid, so it might take more turns if we have to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to time the movements to avoid when cars are at x=0.\n\nx=0 is the position where collision happens if car span includes 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when the cars are at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway and each car, find the times T when 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nSince turns are discrete, T integer.\n\nThen, for each freeway, there are time intervals when it is unsafe to be on that freeway, i.e., when some car has 0 in span.\n\nBut since multiple cars, the freeway is unsafe if any car has collision at that time.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need the set of T where for some car on that freeway, 0 in span(T).\n\nThen, when the player is on that freeway at turn T, it must be that T is not in the unsafe set for that freeway.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: one car, span at T: [37 + 3(T-30), 48 + 3(T-30)]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 3(T-30) <= 0 <= 48 + 3(T-30)\n\nSet u = T-30, so for integer u, 37 + 3u <= 0 <= 48 + 3u\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 3u <= 0 => 3u <= -37 => u <= -37/3 ≈ -12.333, so u <= -13 since u integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 48 + 3u => 3u >= -48 => u >= -16\n\n0 <= 48 + 3u => 48 + 3u >= 0 => 3u >= -48 => u >= -16\n\nAnd 37 + 3u <= 0 => 3u <= -37 => u <= -12.333, so u <= -13\n\nu >= -16 and u <= -13\n\nu integer, so u = -16, -15, -14, -13\n\nThen T = 30 + u, so T = 30-16=14, 15, 16, 17\n\nT = 30 + u, u from -16 to -13, so T=14,15,16,17\n\nBut T=14,15,16,17 are in the past, since current turn is 30. So for T>=30, u>=0, no solution because u<= -13 <0.\n\nThus for freeway 1, for T>=30, 0 is never in the span, so it is always safe for T>=30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car span at T: [ -59 + 6(T-30), -48 + 6(T-30) ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6u <= 0 <= -48 + 6u where u=T-30\n\nFirst: -59 + 6u <= 0 => 6u <= 59 => u <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so u <= 9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6u => 6u >= 48 => u >= 8\n\nSo u >=8 and u <=9, so u=8,9\n\nT=30+8=38, 30+9=39\n\nSo unsafe at T=38 and 39.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car parameters, so also unsafe at T=38,39\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=38,39\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span at T: [37 + 12(T-30), 48 + 12(T-30)]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12u <= 0 <= 48 + 12u, u=T-30\n\nFirst: 37 + 12u <= 0 => 12u <= -37 => u <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, u <= -4? u <= -3.083, so u <= -4 since u integer? Let's see.\n\n12u <= -37, u <= -37/12 = -3.083, since u integer, u <= -4? -4 = -4.0 < -3.083? No.\n\n-37/12 = -3.083, so u <= -3.083, meaning u <= -4? No, u <= -3.083, so for integers, u <= -4? Let's think.\n\nu <= -3.083, since u integer, u <= -4? -4 is less than -3.083, yes, but -3.083 is greater than -4.\n\nFor example, u=-4: 12*(-4) = -48 <= -37? -48 < -37, so 12u <= -37 for u<=-4? 12u <= -37.\n\nIf u=-4, 12*(-4)= -48 <= -37 true.\n\nu=-3, 12*(-3)= -36, -36 <= -37? -36 > -37, so -36 not <= -37, false.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 48 + 12u => 12u >= -48 => u >= -4\n\nSo from first: 37 + 12u <= 0 => 12u <= -37 => u <= floor(-37/12) = floor(-3.083) = -4? Since u integer, u <= -4? Let's solve inequality.\n\n12u <= -37, divide by 12, u <= -37/12 = -3.083, so since u integer, u <= -4? No, u <= -4 is not correct.\n\nu <= -3.083, integers less than or equal to -3.083 are u = -4, -5, -6, ... because u=-4 = -4.0 < -3.083, u=-3 = -3.0 > -3.083, so u=-3 does not satisfy 12u <= -37.\n\nu=-3: 12*(-3) = -36, -36 <= -37? No, -36 > -37.\n\nu=-4: 12*(-4)= -48 <= -37 true.\n\nSimilarly, u >= -4 from second inequality.\n\nSecond: 0 <= 48 + 12u => 48 + 12u >= 0 => 12u >= -48 => u >= -4\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 12u <= 0 => 12u <= -37 => u <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so u <= -4 since u integer? u <= -4.\n\nu <= -3.083, u integer, so u <= -4.\n\nu >= -4 and u <= -4? From u >= -4 and u <= -4, so u = -4.\n\nThen T = 30 + u = 30 - 4 = 26.\n\nBut T=26 is in past, not relevant for T>=30.\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway 5: (0,-11,right,12), span at T: [ -11 + 12(T-30), 0 + 12(T-30) ] = [ -11 + 12u, 12u ] since head=0, so span [ τ + s u, h + s u ] = [ -11 + 12u, 0 + 12u ] = [ -11 + 12u, 12u ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12u <= 0 <= 12u\n\nFirst: -11 + 12u <= 0 => 12u <= 11 => u <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so u <= 0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12u => u >= 0\n\nSo u >=0 and u <=0, so u=0\n\nT=30+0=30\n\nSo at T=30, 0 is in span for this car.\n\nFor freeway 5, at T=30, the second car has 0 in span, so unsafe.\n\nAlso, the first car is not unsafe for T>=30.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe at T=30.\n\nNow for other T? u=0 only for second car.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at T=30 for T>=30? T=30 is current turn, but let's see.\n\nAt T=30, if player is on freeway 5, it would collide, but player starts at y=0 at T=30, not on freeway, so no issue. But for future, if player is on y=5 at T=30, but T=30 is now, player is at y=0.\n\nFor T>30, u>0, for second car: u>=0 and u<=0, only u=0, so for u>0, not satisfied.\n\nFirst car only at u=-4, past.\n\nSo for freeway 5, for T>30, no unsafe times? Only T=30 unsafe, but T=30 is not future for being on freeway.\n\nSince player is at T=30 on y=0, and actions start from a_{30}, moving to y_{31}.\n\nSo for freeway 5, no unsafe times for T>=31, I think.\n\nT=30 is unsafe, but since player not on it at T=30, and for T>=31, no collision possible on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, unsafe only at T=30, for same reason.\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe only at T=30.\n\nNow freeway 8: cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=12, span at T: [ -59 + 12u, -48 + 12u ] with u=T-30\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12u <= 0 <= -48 + 12u\n\nFirst: -59 + 12u <= 0 => 12u <= 59 => u <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, u <= 4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12u => 12u >= 48 => u >= 4\n\nSo u >=4 and u <=4, u=4\n\nT=30+4=34\n\nSecond car: same as before, (0,-11,right,12), span [ -11 + 12u, 12u ]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12u <= 0 <= 12u\n\n-11 + 12u <= 0 => 12u <= 11 => u <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, u <= 0\n\n0 <= 12u => u >= 0\n\nSo u=0, T=30\n\nThus for freeway 8, unsafe at T=30 and T=34.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the unsafe times for T >= 30:\n\n- y=1: no unsafe times (always safe)\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=38,39\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=38,39\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=38,39\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at T=30 (but not relevant for future occupancy), so safe for T>=31\n\n- y=6: same as y=5, safe for T>=31\n\n- y=7: same, safe for T>=31\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=30 and T=34\n\nFor y=8, T=30 unsafe, but again, not occupied at T=30 probably, but for future, unsafe at T=34.\n\nAlso T=30, but we care about when player is on the freeway.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 30, y=0.\n\nWe choose actions a_t for t=30,31,... until we reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y to y+1, y-1, or same, at next turn.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, so minimum 9 steps if always up.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- For y=1: always safe, can be on any time.\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=38,39, so avoid being on y=2 at T=38 or 39.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 and y=4.\n\n- y=5: safe for all T>=31, since unsafe only at T=30.\n\nSimilarly y=6 and y=7.\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=34, so avoid being on y=8 at T=34.\n\nNow, since we start at turn 30, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe critical points are the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times we need to avoid:\n\n- On y=2,3,4: avoid T=38,39\n\n- On y=8: avoid T=34\n\ny=1,5,6,7 have no restrictions for T>=31.\n\ny=5,6,7 are safe for all T>=31.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut if we go straight up, starting from turn 30:\n\nAt turn 30: y=0, choose a_{30}, go to y_{31}\n\nIf we choose U at t=30, y_{31} = 0 +1 =1\n\nThen at turn 31, y=1, which is freeway 1, safe, no issue.\n\nThen a_{31}, if U, y_{32}=2\n\nTurn 32, y=2, freeway 2, but unsafe only at 38,39, so at 32 safe.\n\nSimilarly, continue up.\n\nBut we need to see when we hit the unsafe times.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn:\n\nTurn: action, then y at that turn? Let's define the state.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, check collision if y_{t+1} in 1-8.\n\nStart: t=30, y_{30} = 0\n\nChoose a_{30}: if U, then y_{31} = 1\n\nThen at t=31, y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen a_{31}: if U, y_{32} = 2\n\nt=32, y=2, freeway 2. Now, unsafe at 38,39, 32<38, safe.\n\na_{32}: U, y_{33}=3\n\nt=33, y=3, freeway 3, safe since 33<38.\n\na_{33}: U, y_{34}=4\n\nt=34, y=4, freeway 4. Now T=34, unsafe times for y=4 are 38,39? Earlier y=4 unsafe at 38,39, not 34.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=38,39 only, from above.\n\nSimilarly y=2 and y=3 same.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at 34.\n\nHere at t=34, y=4, which is not y=8, so safe.\n\na_{34}: U, y_{35}=5\n\nt=35, y=5, freeway 5.

Now T=38, but y=8 unsafe at T=34 and T=38? y=8 unsafe at T=34 and T=38?\n\nEarlier for y=8: unsafe at T=30 and T=34.\n\nT=30 is past, T=34 is unsafe.\n\nBut at T=38, is it unsafe?\n\nFor y=8, cars: first car unsafe at T=34, second at T=30.\n\nFor T=38, u=38-30=8\n\nFirst car: span [ -59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [ -59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in [37,48]\n\nSecond car: span [ -11 +12*8, 12*8] = [ -11+96, 96] = [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=38, no car has 0 in span, so safe? But earlier I thought y=2,3,4 unsafe at 38,39.\n\nFor y=8 at T=38, safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=38, y=8, which is freeway 8, and at T=38, it is safe, as above.\n\nThen a_{38}: U, y_{39}=9\n\nt=39, y=9, not a freeway, no collision.\n\nWe reached y=9 at turn 39.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nIn the path: from t=31 to t=38, we were on freeways.\n\nt=31: y=1, safe\n\nt=32: y=2, safe (since 32<38)\n\nt=33: y=3, safe\n\nt=34: y=4, safe (unsafe at 38,39 for y=4)\n\nt=35: y=5, safe\n\nt=36: y=6, safe\n\nt=37: y=7, safe\n\nt=38: y=8, safe as computed\n\nt=39: y=9, done.\n\nActions: from t=30 to t=38, we have actions that lead to this.\n\nt=30: a_{30} = U, to y_{31}=1\n\nt=31: a_{31} = U, to y_{32}=2\n\n...\n\nup to t=38: a_{38} = U, to y_{39}=9\n\nWe used 9 actions: from t=30 to t=38, 9 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart turn t=30, y=0\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to next turn.\n\nSequence of actions: a_{30}, a_{31}, ..., a_{38} for 9 actions, reaching y_{39}=9.\n\nH=9 turns? From t=30 to t=38 inclusive, that's 9 actions? t from 30 to 38 is 9 values: 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38.\n\nAfter a_{38}, y_{39}=9, so at turn 39, we are at y=9.\n\nThe minimal H should be 9, since we need to increase y by 9.\n\nBut in this case, it seems we can do it without collision.\n\nBut we need to confirm for y=8 at t=38.\n\nt=38, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCars: as above, at T=38, u=8\n\nFirst car: span [ -59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [ -59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -11 +12*8, 0 +12*8] = [ -11+96, 96] = [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the unsafe times we mentioned.\n\nFor example, y=2,3,4 unsafe at T=38,39.\n\nAt T=38, if on y=2,3, or4, it would be unsafe, but in our path, at t=38, we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nAt t=39, we are on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at T=34, y=8 is unsafe, but in our path at t=34, we are on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, with 9 actions: all U from t=30 to t=38.\n\nBut the sequence should be for actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, here H=9, so actions at t=30 to t=38.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=30.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\n...\n\nup to Turn 38: U\n\nBut we need to list them.\n\nSince all same, we can write.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9 is minimal possible since we need to go from 0 to 9, each step at most +1.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point we are on unsafe freeway.\n\nFor example, at t=38, y=8, safe as above.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 are unsafe at t=38, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, at t=39, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about t=34? y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at T=38,39, not 34, so safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=34, but we are not on it.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=2,3,4 unsafe at 38,39, but in this path, we pass through them before 38.\n\nFor example, y=2 at t=32, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but we can't, since min 9 steps.\n\nBut what if we go down or stay? That would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo H=9 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 5,6,7 at T=30 unsafe, but we are not on them at T=30.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=5 at t=35, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and in this case, we do.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nActions: from turn 30 to 38, all U.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nAfter a_{38}, at turn 39, y=9.\n\nH=9 turns of actions.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn t_1 + H, I think.\n\nt_1 + H = 30 + 9 = 39, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the freeway 8, there was also unsafe at T=34, but we didn't use it at that time.\n\nIn this sequence, we are on y=8 at t=38, which is fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to avoid going up directly?\n\nSuppose we try to go to y=9 faster, but we can't, since only +1 per step.\n\nUnless we start from different action, but no.\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to stay or down to avoid, but here no need.\n\nBut let me check if at t=34, if we were on y=8, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to new y, not considered on that y until next turn.\n\nIn our case, it's handled.\n\nFor example, when we move from y to y+1, at the turn we move, we are still on old y.\n\nIn the action, when we choose a_t, we move to y_{t+1}, and at turn t+1 we are on y_{t+1}.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 5 at T=30, but we are not on it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can start with S or something, but that would delay, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in this case, H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm with the unsafe times.\n\nThe only potential issue is if at some turn we must be on a freeway when unsafe.\n\nFor example, if we were slower, we might be on y=2 at t=38, but in fast path, we avoid.\n\nSuppose we start with S at t=30.\n\nThen y_{31}=0, still at start.\n\nThen a_{31}=U, y_{32}=1, and so on, then we reach later, say at t=39 y=8 or something, but at t=38, if on y=2, unsafe, so we might collide if not careful.\n\nBut in our case, no need.\n\nFor instance, if we go up all, we are on y=8 at t=38, which is safe, as computed.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=34 unsafe, but we are on y=4 then.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U for 9 steps.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nSo actions: a_{30} to a_{38} all U.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nSet t_1=30.\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t_1 + t}\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=9, so turns from 30 to 38.\n\na_{30} to a_{38} all U.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut to save space, perhaps write \"all U\" but I think list them.\n\nIn the format, it says to list each turn.\n\nSince all same, but I think it's fine.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: freeway 5,6,7 have cars, but for T>=31, safe, and we are on them after t=31, so ok.\n\nFor example, at t=35, y=5, freeway 5, T=35, u=5, cars: first car span [37 +12*5, 48+12*5]= [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -11 +12*5, 12*5]= [-11+60,60]=[49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAt t=38, y=8, as before.\n\nNow, but for y=2,3,4, unsafe at t=38,39.\n\nFor example, if we were on y=4 at t=38, it would be unsafe.\n\nBut in our path, at t=38, y=8.\n\nAt t=39, if on y=4, unsafe, but we are on y=9.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is correct with H=9.\n\nSo the minimal number is 9.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times on Freeways\nThe unsafe times for each freeway (when a collision would occur if the player is on that freeway) are determined based on the car positions and movements. For \\(T \\geq 30\\):\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe (no unsafe times).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at turns 38 and 39.\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at turns 38 and 39.\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe at turns 38 and 39.\n- **Freeway 5**: Unsafe only at turn 30 (but irrelevant for \\(T \\geq 31\\)), so safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\) (unsafe only at turn 30).\n- **Freeway 7**: Safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\) (unsafe only at turn 30).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turns 30 and 34.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in Minimal Turns\nThe minimal number of turns to increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9 is 9, as each \"up\" (U) action increases \\(y\\) by 1. A sequence of 9 consecutive U actions achieves this:\n- Start at turn 30, \\(y = 0\\).\n- After each U action, \\(y\\) increases by 1 at the next turn.\n- Reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 39.\n\nCollision avoidance:\n- At turn 31, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1): Always safe.\n- At turn 32, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2): Safe, as turn 32 < 38.\n- At turn 33, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3): Safe, as turn 33 < 38.\n- At turn 34, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4): Safe, as unsafe times are 38–39 (not 34).\n- At turn 35, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5): Safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\).\n- At turn 36, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6): Safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\).\n- At turn 37, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7): Safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\).\n- At turn 38, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8): Safe, as span calculations show no collision at \\(T = 38\\):\n  - Car 1: Span \\([-59 + 12 \\times 8, -48 + 12 \\times 8] = [37, 48]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: Span \\([-11 + 12 \\times 8, 12 \\times 8] = [85, 96]\\), 0 not in span.\n- At turn 39, \\(y = 9\\): Not a freeway, no collision check.\n\nNo alternative sequence with fewer turns exists, as \\(H = 9\\) is the minimum to increase \\(y\\) by 9. Actions like \"stay\" (S) or \"down\" (D) would increase \\(H\\), so they are not optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 30\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 38\\) (with \\(H = 9\\)) is all U:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,0) at turn t1=36. We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\n Important: Collision occurs at turn T if at that turn we are on a freeway k (which is y=k) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n Also note: When we move (U or D), at the current turn T we are still on the current freeway. Only at the next turn do we change the freeway. So if we move from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T we are on freeway y, and at turn T+1 we are on freeway y+1.\n\n The player update: \n   U: y += 1 (if not at 9)\n   D: y -= 1 (if not at 0)\n   S: stay\n\n We are starting at y=0. We must end at y=9.\n\n The car update:\n   For a car given at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n   At a future turn T (>= t1), the car's position is:\n      if left-moving (d = left): the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n      if right-moving (d = right): the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n But note: in the input, the cars are given for freeways 1 to 8.\n\n However, observe the car state table:\n\n   Freeway 1: (48,37,right,3) -> right-moving so at time T, span = [37 + 3*(T-36), 48 + 3*(T-36)]\n   Freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [ -59 + 6*(T-36), -48 + 6*(T-36) ]\n   Freeway 3: same as freeway 2\n   Freeway 4: same as freeway 2\n   Freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-36), 48+12*(T-36)] and (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12*(T-36), 0+12*(T-36)]\n   Freeway 6: same two cars as freeway 5\n   Freeway 7: same two cars as freeway 5\n   Freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59+12*(T-36), -48+12*(T-36)] and (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12*(T-36), 0+12*(T-36)]\n\n We are at x=0 at every turn. So for a car on the freeway we are on at turn T, we check if 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\n Steps:\n\n We need to move from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But we have obstacles.\n\n We are at y=0 at turn 36. We are not on any freeway (since freeways are from 1 to 8) at turn 36? Actually, the player is at (0,0) and the freeways are at y=1..8. So at y=0, we are safe? But note the collision condition: we are only on a freeway if our y is between 1 and 8. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars.\n\n Therefore:\n   - At y=0: safe.\n   - At y=9: safe (and goal).\n   - At y in [1,8]: we must check the car on that freeway at the turn we are there.\n\n So we must avoid being on a freeway y=k at a turn T if there is a car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\n We are going to simulate the moves. We want the minimal H (number of turns) so we try to go as fast as possible.\n\n However, note that we can also move down? But we start at 0 and want to go to 9. So we should only go up? But sometimes we might have to wait (by staying or even moving down to avoid a collision) to let a car pass.\n\n But note: we can only move up, down, or stay. And we are bounded between 0 and 9.\n\n We are at turn 36 at (0,0). We want to get to (0,9). The minimal H is at least 9 (if we do 9 moves up without waiting). But we might have to wait at some freeways.\n\n However, let's check the freeways we must traverse: y=1,2,...,8.\n\n We can simulate the movement from turn 36 onward. We are going to try to go up as much as possible, but if at a future turn when we plan to be at a freeway k we see a collision, we may have to wait (by staying or moving down) until the car passes.\n\n But note: we are at y=0 at turn 36. We can choose to:\n\n   Turn 36: we are at y=0. We can choose U -> then at turn 37 we are at y=1, and we are on freeway 1 at turn 37.\n\n   Or we can choose S -> then at turn 37 we are still at y=0.\n\n   Or D -> but we are at 0, so D would leave us at 0? (since we cannot go below 0). So D at y=0 is same as S.\n\n Therefore, at y=0 we can only do U or S.\n\n Similarly, at y=9 we can only do D or S? But we are done when we get to y=9? Actually, we are done at the turn when we first reach y=9? The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and we are done. So we don't need to do any action after that.\n\n However, note: the sequence of actions is for t = t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and it leads to y=9 at the next state? Actually, note:\n\n   At turn T, we are at y_T. We choose action a_T. Then we update: y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta(a_T).\n\n   So if at turn T we are at y=8 and we choose U, then at turn T+1 we are at y=9.\n\n   Therefore, we must be at y=8 at turn T and then use U to get to 9 at turn T+1.\n\n   Alternatively, we might be at y=9 at turn T? But we start at y=0. We must go through y=8 to get to 9.\n\n So the last action must be U from y=8 to y=9.\n\n Therefore, we must be at y=8 at the turn before the last.\n\n Now, we plan the moves. We are going to try to go up as fast as possible until we hit a freeway that is occupied at the time we are there.\n\n How to check for a collision at freeway k at turn T?\n\n   For freeway k, we look at all cars on that freeway. For each car, we compute its span at turn T.\n\n   If there is any car on freeway k such that 0 is in [L, R] of the car's span at turn T, then we have a collision.\n\n   Otherwise, we are safe.\n\n Let's compute the car positions at various turns for each freeway.\n\n We note that the cars move continuously. We are at turn 36. We are going to simulate turns 36, 37, 38, ...\n\n We are at y=0 at turn 36. We are safe. We want to go to y=1 at turn 37? Then we must check freeway 1 at turn 37.\n\n Freeway 1: only one car: (48,37,right,3) -> at turn T, the span is [37 + 3*(T-36), 48 + 3*(T-36)]\n\n   At turn 37: T=37 -> [37+3, 48+3] = [40,51] -> 0 is not in [40,51] -> safe.\n\n So we can move to y=1 at turn 37.\n\n Then at turn 37: we are at y=1. We can choose to move to y=2 at turn 38? Then we must check freeway 2 at turn 38.\n\n Freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at turn T, span = [-59 + 6*(T-36), -48 + 6*(T-36)]\n\n   Turn 38: T=38 -> [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\n Then turn 38: at y=2. Then we move to y=3 at turn 39? Check freeway 3 at turn 39.\n\n Freeway 3: same as freeway 2? -> (-48,-59,right,6) -> at T=39: [-59+6*3, -48+6*3] = [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\n Then turn 39: at y=3. Move to y=4 at turn 40? Check freeway 4 at turn 40.\n\n Freeway 4: same as freeway 2 -> at T=40: [-59+6*4, -48+6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\n Then turn 40: at y=4. Move to y=5 at turn 41? Check freeway 5 at turn 41.\n\n Freeway 5: two cars.\n\n   Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> at T=41: [37+12*(5), 48+12*(5)] = [37+60, 48+60] = [97,108] -> safe (0 not in [97,108])\n   Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> at T=41: [-11+12*5, 0+12*5] = [-11+60, 0+60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\n So we can go to y=5 at turn 41.\n\n Then turn 41: at y=5. Move to y=6 at turn 42? Check freeway 6 at turn 42.\n\n Freeway 6: same two cars.\n\n   Car1: at T=42: [37+12*6, 48+12*6] = [37+72,48+72] = [109,120] -> safe.\n   Car2: at T=42: [-11+12*6, 0+12*6] = [-11+72,72] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\n Then turn 42: at y=6. Move to y=7 at turn 43? Check freeway 7 at turn 43.\n\n Freeway 7: same two cars.\n\n   T=43: \n      Car1: [37+12*7,48+12*7] = [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] -> safe.\n      Car2: [-11+12*7, 0+84] = [-11+84,84] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\n Then turn 43: at y=7. Move to y=8 at turn 44? Check freeway 8 at turn 44.\n\n Freeway 8: two cars: \n   Car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at T=44: [-59+12*(44-36), -48+12*(44-36)] = [-59+12*8, -48+96] = [-59+96, 48] = [37,48] -> 0 is not in [37,48] -> safe? \n   But wait: [37,48] does not include 0 -> safe.\n   Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> at T=44: [-11+12*8, 0+96] = [-11+96,96] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\n Then at turn 44: we are at y=8. Then we move to y=9 at turn 45? But we don't need to check freeway 9? because y=9 is safe.\n\n So the sequence: \n   Turn 36: U -> to y=1 at turn37\n   Turn 37: U -> to y=2 at turn38\n   Turn 38: U -> to y=3 at turn39\n   Turn 39: U -> to y=4 at turn40\n   Turn 40: U -> to y=5 at turn41\n   Turn 41: U -> to y=6 at turn42\n   Turn 42: U -> to y=7 at turn43\n   Turn 43: U -> to y=8 at turn44\n   Turn 44: U -> to y=9 at turn45\n\n Total turns: 9 moves (from turn36 to turn44) -> H=9? But note the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1? \n   We have actions at turns: 36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44 -> 9 actions. Then at turn45 we are at y=9? \n   However, note that the player update: \n        At turn36: we are at y0=0. \n        After a36=U: at turn37 we are at y1=1.\n        ... \n        After a44=U: at turn45 we are at y9=9.\n\n   So we need H=9 turns (actions) and we reach at turn45? \n\n   But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we do H actions starting at t1 (t=0) to t1+H-1 (t=H-1). And at the end of these actions, we are at y=9.\n\n   So we have:\n\n        Turn 36: a36\n        Turn 37: a37\n        ...\n        Turn 36+H-1: last action.\n\n   And at the next turn (36+H) we are at y=9.\n\n   Therefore, the number of actions is H, and the last action is at turn (36+H-1). Then the next state is turn (36+H) at y=9.\n\n   So in our case, we have:\n\n        Turn 36: U -> leads to y=1 at turn37\n        ...\n        Turn 44: U -> leads to y=9 at turn45.\n\n        So the last action is at turn44 = 36+8? -> H=9? because 36+H-1=44 -> H-1=8 -> H=9.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 9? \n\n   But wait, we did not wait at any step. We did 9 consecutive U moves.\n\n   However, we must check every step to see if we are safe at the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\n   We checked:\n        Turn37: y=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n        Turn38: y=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n        Turn39: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n        Turn40: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n        Turn41: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n        Turn42: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n        Turn43: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n        Turn44: y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\n   So it seems we can go straight up without waiting.\n\n   But wait: what about the car on freeway8 at turn44? \n        Car1: [37,48] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n        Car2: [85,96] -> safe.\n\n   So the plan is valid.\n\n   However, let me double-check the freeway8 at turn44:\n\n        Time elapsed: 44-36 = 8 turns.\n\n        Car1: originally (-48,-59,right,12) -> \n            tail = -59, head = -48? But note: the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail, ...) but the update uses tail and head? \n\n        The problem says for a right-moving car: \n            Initially: span = [tau, h] -> so in the input, they give (h, tau, ...) but the update: \n                Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n        But the input for freeway8 car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> so head is -48 and tail is -59? \n            Then the initial span at t1=36 is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? \n            Then at turn44: [ -59 + 12*8, -48 + 12*8 ] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48] -> correct.\n\n        Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> initial span: [-11,0] at t1=36? \n            Then at turn44: [-11+12*8, 0+12*8] = [-11+96, 96] = [85,96] -> correct.\n\n   So 0 is not in [37,48] nor [85,96] -> safe.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n   Sequence:\n\n        Turn 36: U\n        Turn 37: U\n        Turn 38: U\n        Turn 39: U\n        Turn 40: U\n        Turn 41: U\n        Turn 42: U\n        Turn 43: U\n        Turn 44: U\n\n   But wait: at turn44 we are at y=8 and we do U to go to y=9 at turn45.\n\n   However, note that at turn44 we are on freeway8? and we are safe. Then we do U and then at turn45 we are at y=9 and safe.\n\n   So the answer is 9 actions.\n\n But let me check if there is any problem at an intermediate step that I might have miscalculated.\n\n   Freeway5 at turn41: \n        Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> initial span: [37,48]? \n            Then at turn41: [37+12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n        Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> initial span: [-11,0]? \n            Then at turn41: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\n   Freeway6 at turn42: \n        Car1: [37+12*6,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe.\n        Car2: [-11+72,72]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\n   Freeway7 at turn43: \n        Car1: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] -> safe.\n        Car2: [-11+84,84]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\n   Freeway8 at turn44: as above.\n\n   And freeways 1-4: we checked the numbers and they are negative or positive but not including 0.\n\n   However, let me check freeway1 at turn37: \n        [37+3,48+3] = [40,51] -> safe.\n\n   Freeway2 at turn38: \n        [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\n   Freeway3 at turn39: \n        [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\n   Freeway4 at turn40: \n        [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\n   All safe.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=9.\n\n However, is there a possibility that we can get there in less than 9? \n   We start at y=0 and must get to y=9. The minimal moves (without obstacles) is 9 moves. Since we did 9 moves and encountered no obstacle, we cannot do less.\n\n So the answer is:\n\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence for t from 0 to H-1, meaning:\n\n   t=0: turn t1+0 = 36\n   t=1: turn 37\n   ...\n   t=8: turn 44\n\n So we have 9 actions.\n\n However, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we have H=9.\n\n So we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we start at turn t1=36. We are to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to the last action.\n\n We have done exactly that.\n\n However, let me check the car on freeway8 at turn44: we are at y=8 at turn44. But note that there is a car on freeway8 at turn44? We checked and it is safe.\n\n But what about the car on freeway8 at turn44: the car1 has span [37,48] and car2 [85,96] and we are at x=0 -> safe.\n\n Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n But wait: the freeway5,6,7 have two cars? But we checked and they are safe at the turns we are there.\n\n However, let me check freeway5 at turn41 again: \n      The two cars: one at [97,108] and one at [49,60] -> 0 is not in either.\n\n Similarly, freeway6 at turn42: [109,120] and [61,72] -> safe.\n\n freeway7 at turn43: [121,132] and [73,84] -> safe.\n\n So we are confident.\n\n But note: the car representation for freeway5,6,7: \n        (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\n   The first car: head=48, tail=37 -> so the span is [37,48] at t1=36? \n        Then at turn41: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> correct.\n\n   The second car: head=0, tail=-11 -> span at t1=36: [-11,0] -> at turn41: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> correct.\n\n So we are good.\n\n Therefore, the minimal sequence is 9 moves of 'U'.\n\n However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=9.\n\n But note: what if we can do it in less by waiting? \n   We cannot because we must make 9 upward moves. The minimal number of moves is 9.\n\n So we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". We have checked that at the turn we are at each freeway (from 1 to 8) we are safe.\n\n However, note that we are at y=0 at turn36 and then we move to y=1 at turn37. We never are at y=0 again? and we are safe at y=0.\n\n So the sequence is valid.\n\n But let me simulate step by step:\n\n   Turn36: at (0,0) -> action U -> next position: (0,1) at turn37.\n        Check at turn37: we are at y=1 -> freeway1: car at [40,51] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\n   Turn37: at (0,1) -> action U -> (0,2) at turn38.\n        Check turn38: y=2 -> freeway2: car at [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\n   Turn38: at (0,2) -> action U -> (0,3) at turn39.\n        Check turn39: y=3 -> freeway3: car at [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\n   Turn39: at (0,3) -> action U -> (0,4) at turn40.\n        Check turn40: y=4 -> freeway4: car at [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\n   Turn40: at (0,4) -> action U -> (0,5) at turn41.\n        Check turn41: y=5 -> freeway5: two cars: [97,108] and [49,60] -> safe.\n\n   Turn41: at (0,5) -> action U -> (0,6) at turn42.\n        Check turn42: y=6 -> freeway6: [109,120] and [61,72] -> safe.\n\n   Turn42: at (0,6) -> action U -> (0,7) at turn43.\n        Check turn43: y=7 -> freeway7: [121,132] and [73,84] -> safe.\n\n   Turn43: at (0,7) -> action U -> (0,8) at turn44.\n        Check turn44: y=8 -> freeway8: [37,48] and [85,96] -> safe.\n\n   Turn44: at (0,8) -> action U -> (0,9) at turn45 -> goal and safe.\n\n So it works.\n\n But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=9. Is there a way to do it in 8? \n   We must go from 0 to 9: that requires 9 moves up. So no.\n\n Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n However, wait: what if we skip a freeway by moving two at a time? But we can only move one step per turn. So we must go through each freeway one by one.\n\n Thus, we output the sequence.\n\n One more thing: the freeway8 car1 at turn44: [37,48] -> but what if we had been there at an earlier turn? \n   For example, if we had arrived at turn43 at freeway8, then we would have to check:\n\n        At turn43: freeway8 car1: [ -59+12*(43-36), -48+12*7] = [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36] -> 0 not in [25,36] -> safe.\n        car2: [ -11+12*7, 0+84] = [-11+84,84] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\n   So if we had arrived at turn43 at freeway8, we would be safe. \n\n   But in our plan we are at freeway8 at turn44, which is also safe.\n\n   However, we did not choose to get there earlier because we are going one step per turn.\n\n   So we are using the minimal number of turns.\n\n   But note: we could potentially go faster? We did 9 moves in 9 turns. We cannot go faster.\n\n Therefore, we are confident.\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\) in \\(H = 9\\) turns is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn. This sequence avoids collisions with all cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 36 (y=0 → y=1)**: Freeway 1 car span at turn 37: \\([37 + 3(37-36), 48 + 3(37-36)] = [40, 51]\\). 0 ∉ [40, 51] → safe.\n- **Turn 37 (y=1 → y=2)**: Freeway 2 car span at turn 38: \\([-59 + 6(38-36), -48 + 6(38-36)] = [-47, -36]\\). 0 ∉ [-47, -36] → safe.\n- **Turn 38 (y=2 → y=3)**: Freeway 3 car span at turn 39: \\([-59 + 6(39-36), -48 + 6(39-36)] = [-41, -30]\\). 0 ∉ [-41, -30] → safe.\n- **Turn 39 (y=3 → y=4)**: Freeway 4 car span at turn 40: \\([-59 + 6(40-36), -48 + 6(40-36)] = [-35, -24]\\). 0 ∉ [-35, -24] → safe.\n- **Turn 40 (y=4 → y=5)**: Freeway 5 cars at turn 41:\n  - Car 1: \\([37 + 12(41-36), 48 + 12(41-36)] = [97, 108]\\), 0 ∉ [97, 108] → safe.\n  - Car 2: \\([-11 + 12(41-36), 0 + 12(41-36)] = [49, 60]\\), 0 ∉ [49, 60] → safe.\n- **Turn 41 (y=5 → y=6)**: Freeway 6 cars at turn 42:\n  - Car 1: \\([37 + 12(42-36), 48 + 12(42-36)] = [109, 120]\\), 0 ∉ [109, 120] → safe.\n  - Car 2: \\([-11 + 12(42-36), 0 + 12(42-36)] = [61, 72]\\), 0 ∉ [61, 72] → safe.\n- **Turn 42 (y=6 → y=7)**: Freeway 7 cars at turn 43:\n  - Car 1: \\([37 + 12(43-36), 48 + 12(43-36)] = [121, 132]\\), 0 ∉ [121, 132] → safe.\n  - Car 2: \\([-11 + 12(43-36), 0 + 12(43-36)] = [73, 84]\\), 0 ∉ [73, 84] → safe.\n- **Turn 43 (y=7 → y=8)**: Freeway 8 cars at turn 44:\n  - Car 1: \\([-59 + 12(44-36), -48 + 12(44-36)] = [37, 48]\\), 0 ∉ [37, 48] → safe.\n  - Car 2: \\([-11 + 12(44-36), 0 + 12(44-36)] = [85, 96]\\), 0 ∉ [85, 96] → safe.\n- **Turn 44 (y=8 → y=9)**: Position (0, 9) is the goal and has no cars.\n\nThe sequence requires 9 turns (actions) to reach (0, 9) at turn 45.

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is updated as:\n  U: y = y + 1 (unless y is already 9)\n  D: y = y - 1 (unless y is already 0)\n  S: y remains\n\nWe start at y=0 and we want to get to y=9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) then we must avoid having 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) in the span of any car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y to y' at turn T, we are only on the freeway y at turn T. At the next turn (T+1) we are on y'. So if we move up from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T we are on y, and at turn T+1 we are on y+1.\n\nThe cars are moving. For each car, we are given its state at turn 42. We need to compute the span at any future turn T.\n\nFor a car at turn 42 (t_1=42) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n\nIf the car is right-moving (d='right'):\n  At turn T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-42), h + s*(T-42)]\n\nIf the car is left-moving (d='left'):\n  At turn T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-42), tau - s*(T-42)]\n\nBut note: the table given has both head and tail. However, in the description for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] (so head is the larger one) and for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] (so head is the larger one). But looking at the data, all cars in the given state are right-moving. However, the representation in the table might be consistent: the first number is head and the second is tail? But note the example for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h]? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nFor right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] (so tau <= h) and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, the car on freeway 1: (48,37,right,3) -> so head=48, tail=37? Then the initial span at t1=42 is [37,48]? But the update rule for right says: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-42), h + s*(T-42)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). So for the second car: head=0, tail=-11? Then the initial span is [-11,0]? Then at T, it becomes [-11+12*(T-42), 0+12*(T-42)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is between 1 and 8) and the x-coordinate 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 42 at (0,0). Note that freeway 0 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8) so at y=0 we are safe. Similarly, at y=9 we are safe. We only have to worry when we are at y in {1,2,...,8}.\n\nOur goal: reach (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn 42 (t1) until the turn we reach 9.\n\nWe need to plan a path from y=0 to y=9 in minimal H (number of turns including the starting turn? But note: we are at turn 42 at y=0. Then we take actions at turn 42, 43, ... until we reach 9 at some turn.\n\nNote: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we take H actions: at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at the end of these actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So we start at turn 42 and we take H actions, and at turn 42+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 42 at y0=0. Then at turn 42 we take action a_42. Then at turn 43 we are at y1 = y0 + delta(a_42). Then we take a_43, and so on.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T if there is a car on that freeway at T such that 0 is in its span.\n\nWe note that we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we must pass through each y from 0 to 9. However, we can skip some by moving faster? Actually, we must go from 0 to 1, then 2, ... up to 9. But we can also move down? But we want to minimize turns so we probably want to go up as fast as possible. However, sometimes we might need to wait (by staying or even moving down) to avoid a collision.\n\nBut note: we start at y=0 (safe) and we must end at y=9 (safe). The freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway and for each turn T if we are planning to be on that freeway at turn T, then we must not have 0 in the span of any car on that freeway at T.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,37,right,3)\nFreeway 2: one car: (-48,-59,right,6)   [head=-48, tail=-59? so the initial span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]?]\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6)\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6)\nFreeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\nFreeway 6: two cars: same as freeway 5: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\nFreeway 7: two cars: same: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAll are right-moving.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each car, the span at time T (where T is the turn number, starting from 42).\n\nWe'll denote:\n  For a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn 42 (t0=42), at turn T (T>=42):\n    If d='right': \n        tail_T = tau + s*(T-42)\n        head_T = h + s*(T-42)\n        span = [tail_T, head_T]   (since tau <= h, so tail_T <= head_T)\n\nBut note: the representation in the table for freeway 1: (48,37,right,3). So h=48, tau=37? Then at T, tail_T = 37 + 3*(T-42), head_T = 48 + 3*(T-42).\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: h=-48, tau=-59? Then tail_T = -59 + 6*(T-42), head_T = -48 + 6*(T-42).\n\nFor freeway 5: two cars:\n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> tail1_T = 37+12*(T-42), head1_T=48+12*(T-42)\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> tail2_T = -11+12*(T-42), head2_T=0+12*(T-42)\n\nWe are only concerned with whether 0 is in the span [tail, head] for a given car at a given turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving. We want to minimize the number of turns. So we would prefer to move up as much as possible. However, we must avoid the freeways when the car spans include 0.\n\nWe start at turn 42 at y=0 (safe). We can choose to move up to y=1 at turn 42 (then we are at y=1 at turn 42) or stay at y=0.\n\nBut note: at turn 42, we are at (0,0) and we are safe. If we choose to move up at turn 42, then at turn 42 we will be at y=1? Actually, the update: at turn 42 we take an action. Then the position at turn 43 is determined by that action? Or is the position updated immediately?\n\nLooking at the update: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. We take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn 42 (the current turn), we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action a_42. Then at turn 43, we move to y_43 = y_42 + Δy_42.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: we are on a freeway at a turn T if at that turn T we are at y_T in {1,...,8}. However, when we are at turn 42, we are at y=0 (safe) so we don't check freeway 0. Then at turn 43, we are at y_43 which might be 0,1, or even -1? but no, because we are bounded [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and do D, we stay at 0. Similarly, at 9 and do U, we stay at 9.\n\nSo the state at turn 42: y42=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we take an action at turn 42. The result (new y) is at turn 43.\n\nTherefore, we are never at a freeway at turn 42? We are only at freeways at turns starting from 43? Actually, no: the problem says \"at turn T\" we are at (0, y_T). So at turn 42, we are at (0,0). Then at turn 43, we are at (0, y43). So we only check collisions at a turn T if at that turn T we are at a freeway (y_T in [1,8]).\n\nTherefore, at turn 42 we are safe (y=0). Then we take an action at turn 42 that will determine y43. Then at turn 43, we are at y43 and we check if y43 is in [1,8] and if so, we must avoid the cars on that freeway at turn 43.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 44, we are at y44, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9. The minimal number of turns would be 9 moves up: but we start at 0, and we want to be at 9. We need 9 moves of U. But we might have to wait sometimes.\n\nBut note: we can do 9 consecutive U moves? Then we would be at turn 43: y=1, turn44: y=2, ... turn50: y=8, and then turn51: y=9. So that would take 9 moves (from turn42 to turn50: 9 actions) and then at turn51 we are at 9. So H=9? But note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. So we take actions at turn42,43,...,42+H-1. Then at turn42+H-1 we are at 9. So if we take 9 actions: at turn42 (first action) to turn50 (9th action) then at turn50 we would be at y=9? \n\nBut let's see: \n  turn42: action U -> at turn43: y=1\n  turn43: action U -> at turn44: y=2\n  ...\n  turn50: action U -> at turn51: y=9\n\nBut then we are at y=9 at turn51. So the last action is at turn50. Then H=9? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: 9 actions. Then at turn42+9-1 = 50, we have taken the last action. But then at turn51 we are at y=9. So the condition is that at the turn we finish the actions (turn50) we have not reached y=9? We are at y=8 at turn50? Then at turn51 we are at y=9? But the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo we want at turn (42 + H - 1) to be at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan, at turn50 we are at y=8? Then we would need one more action at turn50: U -> then at turn51 we are at y=9. But 42+H-1 = 51 -> H=10? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nWe start at turn42: y42=0.\n\nAfter one action (at turn42) we get to turn43: y43 = y42 + Δy42.\n\nWe want at turn (42+H-1) to be y_{42+H-1}=9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: 42, 43, 44, ..., 42+H-1 (total H actions).\n\nThe position at turn (42) is given. Then:\n  turn42: action a0 -> turn43: y43 = y42 + Δa0\n  turn43: action a1 -> turn44: y44 = y43 + Δa1\n  ...\n  turn42+H-1: action a_{H-1} -> turn42+H: y_{42+H} = y_{42+H-1} + Δa_{H-1}\n\nBut the problem says: we take actions from t=0 to H-1 (so H actions) and then we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 42+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nSo at turn42+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nHow did we get there? We took H actions: the last action is taken at turn42+H-1. Then the position at turn42+H-1 is the result of the actions taken at turns 42 to 42+H-1? \n\nBut note: the position at turn t is determined by the action at turn t-1? \n\nActually, the state at turn42 is given. Then we take action at turn42 and it affects the state at turn43. The state at turn43 is y43. Then we take action at turn43 to get to turn44, etc.\n\nSo the position at turn42 is fixed. Then:\n  y_{42} = 0 (given)\n  y_{43} = y42 + Δy42 (from action a_42)\n  y_{44} = y43 + Δy43\n  ...\n  y_{42+k} = y_{42+k-1} + Δy_{42+k-1}\n\nWe require y_{42+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we have to go from y42=0 to y_{42+H-1}=9 in H-1 steps? Because from turn42 to turn42+H-1, there are (42+H-1 - 42) = H-1 steps.\n\nBut each step can change y by at most 1. Therefore, the minimal H must be at least 10? Because we need 9 steps to go from 0 to 9 (each step up). Then:\n\n  H-1 >= 9  => H>=10.\n\nSo minimal H is 10? Then the sequence would be 10 actions: at turn42 to turn51? And we are at turn42+10-1 = 51? But we want at turn51 to be at 9.\n\nBut note: we are taking 10 actions: at turn42,43,...,51. Then the position at turn51 is the result of the action at turn50? and then the action at turn51 would set turn52? But we don't care about turn52.\n\nWait: the last action is at turn42+H-1. Then we require that at that same turn (42+H-1) the y is 9.\n\nBut the y at turn t is set by the action at turn t-1? \n\nActually, the problem states: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1. Then the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut how is the position at turn t1+H-1 computed? It is the result of the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nLet me define:\n\nAt turn t1 (42): we have y_{t1} = 0.\n\nThen:\n  Action a_{t1} (at turn42) -> y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δa_{t1}\n  Action a_{t1+1} (at turn43) -> y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δa_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Action a_{t1+H-2} (at turn42+H-2) -> y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Δa_{t1+H-2}\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to have taken H-1 actions? Then the number of actions is H? But the actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}? That doesn't fit.\n\nLooking back: the sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So the actions are:\n  a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen the turn indices for actions: 42, 43, ..., 42+H-1.\n\nNow, the position at turn t1 (42) is given as 0.\n\nThe position at turn t1+1 (43) is y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δa_{t1}\n\nThe position at turn t1+2 (44) is y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δa_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δa_{t1} + Δa_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nThe position at turn t1+k is y_{t1} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δa_{t1+i}\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 42+H-1) we have y=9.\n\nSo:\n  y_{t1+H-1} = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δa_{t1+i} = 9\n\nThe net displacement must be 9. Each action can contribute +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S). Therefore, the minimal number of actions (which is H) must be such that the net displacement is 9. The minimal H is achieved if we use as many U as possible. We need at least 9 U's. But we can also have extra actions that are S or D (but that would increase H). So minimal H is 9? But then we have 9 actions: from i=0 to 8, and the displacement is the sum of 9 deltas. We need the sum to be 9. So we must have 9 U's and no D or S? Then we go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps? But then:\n\n  y_{t1+0} = 0 (given)\n  After action at t1+0: y_{t1+1} = 1\n  ...\n  After action at t1+8: y_{t1+9} = 9\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+8} = 9? Then H-1=8 -> H=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+8 (50) and then at turn 50 we are at 9? But the position at turn t1+H-1 (42+9-1=50) is 9.\n\nBut note: at turn50 we are at 9. How did we get there? The action at turn49 (which is the 8th action) would have moved us from 8 to 9. Then at turn50 we are at 9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns 42 to 50 (9 actions). Then at turn50 we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9? But we must check if we can do 9 consecutive U moves without colliding.\n\nWe must check for each turn T from 43 to 50 (because at turn42 we are at 0, safe; then at turn43 we are at y=1, then turn44 at y=2, etc. until turn50 at y=9) whether at that turn T we are at a freeway and if 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn T.\n\nSo we need to check freeways 1 to 8 at turns 43 to 50.\n\nLet's compute the car spans for each freeway at turns 43 to 50.\n\nWe'll denote T0=42.\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) at T0, at turn T (>=42):\n  tail_T = tau + s*(T-42)\n  head_T = h + s*(T-42)\n\nWe are only concerned with whether 0 is in [tail_T, head_T] (closed interval).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,37,right,3)\n  tail_T = 37 + 3*(T-42)\n  head_T = 48 + 3*(T-42)\n\nWe are on freeway 1 at turn T if we are at y=1 at turn T. In the consecutive U plan, we are at y=1 at turn43.\n\nSo for freeway 1 at turn43:\n  tail_43 = 37 + 3*(1) = 40\n  head_43 = 48 + 3 = 51\n  Span: [40,51] -> 0 is not in [40,51] -> safe.\n\nAt turn44? We are at y=2 at turn44, so freeway2? Actually, at turn43 we are at y=1 (freeway1) and at turn44 we are at y=2 (freeway2). So we don't check freeway1 at turn44.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n  tail_T = -59 + 6*(T-42)\n  head_T = -48 + 6*(T-42)\n\nWe are on freeway2 at turn44 (if we are at y=2 at turn44).\n\nAt turn44: T=44, so T-42=2\n  tail_44 = -59 + 6*2 = -59+12 = -47\n  head_44 = -48 + 12 = -36\n  Span: [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2? \n  At turn45: we are at y=3 (freeway3) at turn45.\n  T-42=3\n  tail_45 = -59 + 6*3 = -59+18 = -41\n  head_45 = -48 + 18 = -30\n  Span: [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway2? \n  At turn46: y=4, T=46, T-42=4\n  tail_46 = -59+6*4 = -59+24 = -35\n  head_46 = -48+24 = -24\n  safe.\n\nFreeway5: two cars: \n  car1: (48,37,right,12)\n      tail1_T = 37 + 12*(T-42)\n      head1_T = 48 + 12*(T-42)\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12)\n      tail2_T = -11 + 12*(T-42)\n      head2_T = 0 + 12*(T-42)\n\nWe are on freeway5 at turn47 (y=5 at turn47).\n\nAt turn47: T=47, T-42=5\n  car1: tail1_47 = 37 + 12*5 = 37+60=97, head1_47=48+60=108 -> [97,108] -> 0 not in\n  car2: tail2_47 = -11+60=49, head2_47=0+60=60 -> [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  At turn48: y=6, T=48, T-42=6\n  car1: tail1_48 = 37+12*6=37+72=109, head1_48=48+72=120 -> safe\n  car2: tail2_48 = -11+72=61, head2_48=72 -> [61,72] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway5?\n  At turn49: y=7, T=49, T-42=7\n  car1: 37+12*7=37+84=121, head=48+84=132 -> safe\n  car2: -11+84=73, head=84 -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n  At turn50: we are at y=8? But wait: in our plan, at turn49 we are at y=7? Then at turn49 we take U -> then at turn50 we are at y=8. But note: we are at freeway8 at turn50.\n\nBut wait: we require to be at y=9 at turn50? Actually, in the consecutive U plan:\n\n  turn42: start at 0, take U -> at turn43:1\n  turn43: U -> turn44:2\n  turn44: U -> turn45:3\n  turn45: U -> turn46:4\n  turn46: U -> turn47:5\n  turn47: U -> turn48:6\n  turn48: U -> turn49:7\n  turn49: U -> turn50:8\n  turn50: we take the 9th action: U -> then at turn51:9.\n\nBut we require at turn50 (which is 42+9-1=50) to be at 9? But we are at 8 at turn50. So we are not at 9.\n\nSo we see: to be at 9 at turn50, we must have taken an action at turn49 that gets us from 8 to 9? Then we are at 9 at turn50. But then we would have taken 8 actions? But we need to be at 9 at turn50, which is the 9th turn? Actually, the actions are at turn42 to turn49 (8 actions) and then at turn50 we are at 9? But then H=8? But we started at 0, so we need 9 moves? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-index:\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt t=42: y=0.\nWe take an action at t=42: then at t=43: y = 0 + Δa42.\n\nWe require at t = 42+H-1: y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken at t=42,43,...,42+H-1 (H actions).\n\nThe position at t=42+H-1 is the result of the actions taken at t=42 to t=42+H-2? \n\nBut note: the action taken at time t affects the position at time t+1.\n\nTherefore, the position at time t is determined by the actions taken at times 42 to t-1.\n\nSpecifically:\n  y_{42} = 0 (given)\n  y_{43} = 0 + Δa42\n  y_{44} = y43 + Δa43 = 0 + Δa42 + Δa43\n  ...\n  y_{42+k} = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δa_{42+i}\n\nWe want y_{42+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo:\n  0 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δa_{42+i} = 9.\n\nThis sum is the total displacement from the H-1 actions taken at t=42,43,...,42+H-2.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 9 upward moves. And we have H-1 actions to do that. So the minimal H-1 is 9, so H=10.\n\nThen we have 10 actions: at t=42 to t=51. Then the position at t=51 is determined by the actions at t=42 to t=50. We require y_{51}=9? But the turn we require is t1+H-1 = 42+10-1=51.\n\nSo we want y51=9.\n\nIn the consecutive U plan without waiting, we would do:\n\n  t42: U -> y43=1\n  t43: U -> y44=2\n  t44: U -> y45=3\n  t45: U -> y46=4\n  t46: U -> y47=5\n  t47: U -> y48=6\n  t48: U -> y49=7\n  t49: U -> y50=8\n  t50: U -> y51=9\n\nSo 10 actions: from turn42 to turn51? But the actions are at turn42 to turn50 (10 actions? 42,43,...,50 is 9 actions?).\n\nLet me count: \n  actions: \n    turn42: first action\n    turn43: second\n    ...\n    turn50: ninth action? -> then we have taken 9 actions? \n\nBut we need 10 actions? \n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1+0} = a42\n  a_{t1+1} = a43\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} = a_{42+H-1}\n\nWe have H actions. The last action is at turn42+H-1.\n\nThen the position at turn42+H-1 is y_{42+H-1} = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δa_{42+i}\n\nWe require that sum to be 9. So we need H-1 >=9 -> H>=10.\n\nThen the last action is at turn42+H-1 = 42+10-1=51. But the position at turn51 is set by actions from 42 to 50. The action at turn51 would set turn52, which we don't care.\n\nSo the consecutive U plan has 10 actions: from turn42 to turn51? But turn42 to turn51 is 10 turns: 42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51 -> 10 actions. Then the last action is at turn51? But then the position at turn51 is determined by the action at turn50? and the action at turn51 is taken but then we look at turn52? \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nLet me read the problem carefully: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nAlso, the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo the action a_t is taken at turn t, and it produces y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1 (42) is given. Then we take a_{42} and then at turn43 we have y43.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1 (42+H-1) we have y_{42+H-1}=9.\n\nHow is y_{42+H-1} obtained? It is obtained by the action at turn42+H-2: \n   y_{42+H-1} = y_{42+H-2} + Δa_{42+H-2}\n\nBut y_{42+H-2} is obtained by the previous actions, and so on.\n\nWe can write:\n   y_{42} = 0\n   y_{43} = 0 + Δa42\n   ...\n   y_{42+k} = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δa_{42+i}\n\nSo for k = H-1, we have:\n   y_{42+H-1} = sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δa_{42+i} = 9\n\nTherefore, we need H-1 actions to get the displacement of 9. Each action can give at most +1. So we need at least 9 actions that are U, and possibly some S or D that cancel out. The minimal H-1 is 9, so minimal H is 10.\n\nThen the sequence has 10 actions: a42 to a51. But note: the last action a51 is taken at turn51, but it does not affect y51. It affects y52. So for the purpose of reaching y51=9, we don't care about a51. But the problem requires a sequence of H actions, including a51.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So at turn51 (if H=10) we are at 9. But the last action a51 is taken at turn51, but it doesn't change the position at turn51. It changes turn52. So we are at 9 at turn51 regardless of a51.\n\nTherefore, we can set a51 to anything? But we must avoid collision at turn51? At turn51 we are at y51=9, which is safe. So we can set a51 to S, for example.\n\nBut note: during the journey, we must avoid collisions at every turn from 43 to 51? But at turn51 we are at y=9, safe. So we only care about turns 43 to 50.\n\nTherefore, the consecutive U plan for 9 ups and then one extra action (which can be S) would work, but we must check that from turn43 to turn50 we are safe at freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe already checked for freeways 1 to 7 in turns 43 to 49? Let's recap:\n\nIn the consecutive U plan (9 U's) we have:\n\n  turn43: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe\n  turn44: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe\n  turn45: y=3 (freeway3) -> safe\n  turn46: y=4 (freeway4) -> safe\n  turn47: y=5 (freeway5) -> safe\n  turn48: y=6 (freeway6) -> safe\n  turn49: y=7 (freeway7) -> safe\n  turn50: y=8 (freeway8) -> we haven't checked freeway8 at turn50.\n\nWe must check freeway8 at turn50.\n\nFreeway8: two cars: \n  car1: (-48,-59,right,12)\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt turn50: T=50, T-42=8\n  car1: tail1_50 = -59 + 12*8 = -59+96 = 37, head1_50 = -48+96=48 -> span [37,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  car2: tail2_50 = -11+96=85, head2_50=0+96=96 -> [85,96] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do 9 consecutive U's and then one extra action (say S) and we are safe at every turn.\n\nBut the 9 U's get us from y=0 at turn42 to:\n  turn43:1, 44:2, 45:3, 46:4, 47:5, 48:6, 49:7, 50:8, and then at turn51: we do the 10th action (U) -> then y51=9. \n\nBut wait: we require at turn51 (which is 42+10-1=51) to be at 9. But in this plan, after the 9th U (at turn50) we are at y50=8? Then at turn51, we take the 10th action (U) and then y51=9. But then the position at turn51 is 9. So it matches.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway8 at turn50? Yes, but we checked and it's safe.\n\nAnd at turn51 we are at y=9, safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and the sequence is 9 U's and then one U at the end? But then we have 10 U's? That would give y51=10, but that's not allowed.\n\nWe must do exactly 9 U's and one action that does not change y? But then at turn51 we would be at 9? How?\n\nLet me simulate with 10 actions:\n\n  action at turn42: U -> y43=1\n  action at turn43: U -> y44=2\n  ...\n  action at turn49: U -> y50=8  (because from y49=7, U gets to 8 at turn50)\n  action at turn50: U -> y51=9\n\nSo we have 9 U's from turn42 to turn49? That's 8 actions? Let me count:\n\n  turn42: action0: U -> y43=1\n  turn43: action1: U -> y44=2\n  turn44: action2: U -> y45=3\n  turn45: action3: U -> y46=4\n  turn46: action4: U -> y47=5\n  turn47: action5: U -> y48=6\n  turn48: action6: U -> y49=7\n  turn49: action7: U -> y50=8\n  turn50: action8: U -> y51=9\n\nWe have 9 actions: from turn42 to turn50. But then H=9? And we are at turn42+H-1=42+9-1=50? But at turn50 we are at y50=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need one more action. We do:\n\n  turn50: action8: U -> then y51=9.\n\nBut then we are at turn51: y51=9. To have y51=9, we need to be at turn51. So the turn index for the requirement is 51, which is 42+H-1 -> 42+H-1=51 -> H=10.\n\nSo we need 10 actions: from turn42 to turn51. The last action at turn51 is not used to move to 9? Because the move to 9 is done by the action at turn50. The action at turn51 can be anything because we are already at 9 and we only require to be at 9 at turn51.\n\nSo we can set the 10th action (at turn51) to S.\n\nThen the sequence: \n  turn42: U\n  turn43: U\n  turn44: U\n  turn45: U\n  turn46: U\n  turn47: U\n  turn48: U\n  turn49: U\n  turn50: U  -> this gets us from 8 to 9 at turn51.\n  turn51: S  -> we are still at 9 at turn52, but we only care about turn51.\n\nBut note: at turn50 we are at y50=8 (freeway8) and we already checked that at turn50 freeway8 is safe.\n\nAt turn51, we are at y51=9 (safe).\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and the sequence is 9 U's and then one S.\n\nBut let me verify the turns:\n\n  At turn42: y42=0 (safe)\n  Action42: U -> y43=1 (freeway1): check turn43 -> we did: safe.\n  Action43: U -> y44=2: safe.\n  Action44: U -> y45=3: safe.\n  Action45: U -> y46=4: safe.\n  Action46: U -> y47=5: safe.\n  Action47: U -> y48=6: safe.\n  Action48: U -> y49=7: safe.\n  Action49: U -> y50=8: at turn50, freeway8: we checked at T=50: safe.\n  Action50: U -> then y51=9. But wait, the action50 is taken at turn50, and it produces y51=9.\n  Then we take action51: S -> y52=9 (but we don't care).\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn51 (which is 42+10-1=51) we are at 9. And indeed, y51=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is 9 U's and then at the 10th action we can do S. But we only need to output the actions from turn42 to turn51 (10 actions). However, the 10th action (at turn51) is not necessary for reaching 9 at turn51, but it is part of the sequence.\n\nBut note: we are not required to be at 9 at turn52, only at turn51. So we can do:\n\n  a42 to a49: U (8 actions) -> then at turn50: y50=8.\n  a50: U -> then y51=9.\n  a51: S (or U, but then y52=10 which is invalid, so we must do S or D? But if we do D at turn51, y52=8, but we are at turn51: y51=9 is already achieved. The action at turn51 can be S (which keeps y52=9) or D (which would make y52=8, but we don't care). But the problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9, only that at turn51 we are at 9.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collision at turn51: we are at y51=9, safe. And at turn52 we are not required to be safe? The problem only requires avoiding collisions during the journey until we reach (0,9). Once we reach (0,9) at turn51, we are done.\n\nBut note: the action at turn51 is taken, and then we are at turn52. But the collision condition is checked at every turn when we are on a freeway. At turn52, if we are at y52=9 (if we did S) then safe. If we did D, then y52=8, and then we would be on freeway8 at turn52. But we are not required to avoid collisions after turn51? The problem says: \"to reach (0,9)\" and then stop. So probably we only care up to turn51.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars\" during the game. Since the game ends when we reach (0,9) at turn51, then we don't care about turn52. So we can do any action at turn51.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do S at turn51 so we stay at 9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n  Turn 42: U\n  Turn 43: U\n  Turn 44: U\n  Turn 45: U\n  Turn 46: U\n  Turn 47: U\n  Turn 48: U\n  Turn 49: U\n  Turn 50: U\n  Turn 51: S\n\nBut wait, this is 10 actions. And at turn51 we are at 9.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 actions? We concluded H must be at least 10. But let me see:\n\nIf we do 9 actions: then we require y_{42+9-1}=y50=9.\n\nTo have y50=9, we must have taken actions that give a total displacement of 9 in 9 actions? But the displacement is the sum of the first 8 actions (because the action at turn49 sets y50). \n\nWe have:\n  y50 = 0 + sum_{i=0}^{8} ? Let me see:\n\n  y43 = 0 + Δa42\n  y44 = y43 + Δa43 = Δa42 + Δa43\n  ...\n  y50 = Δa42 + Δa43 + ... + Δa49\n\nThat's 8 terms (from a42 to a49). So we need 8 actions to give a sum of 9. But each can be at most 1, so maximum sum is 8. Therefore, it's impossible to get to 9 in 8 steps. So H must be at least 10.\n\nHence, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the consecutive U plan, we saw that freeway8 at turn50 is safe. So we can do the 10 actions as above.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway8 at turn50: \n  T=50, T-42=8\n  car1: tail = -59 + 12*8 = -59+96=37, head=-48+96=48 -> [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: tail=-11+96=85, head=0+96=96 -> [85,96] -> 0 not in.\n\nAnd freeway1 at turn43: [40,51] -> 0 not in.\nfreeway2 at turn44: [-47,-36] -> safe.\nfreeway3 at turn45: [-41,-30] -> safe.\nfreeway4 at turn46: [-35,-24] -> safe.\nfreeway5 at turn47: car1 [97,108], car2 [49,60] -> safe.\nfreeway6 at turn48: [109,120] and [61,72] -> safe.\nfreeway7 at turn49: [121,132] and [73,84] -> safe.\n\nSo all are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 9 U's and then an S (or we could do D, but S is simpler).\n\nBut note: the last action (at turn51) can be U? But then y52=10, which is invalid. The player update restricts y to [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9? The problem says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9].\n\nSo if we are at 9 and do U, then we try to go to 10, but it's clamped to 9? Or is it not allowed? The problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\", so probably it stays at 9. So we could do U at turn51 as well. But that would be redundant. We can do S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: S\n\nBut wait, at turn50 we do U: then at turn51 we are at 9. Then at turn51 we do S: then we stay at 9 for turn52. But we only require turn51 to be 9. So it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n  Turn50: U -> then we are at 9 at turn51.\n  Turn51: we can do anything? But to be safe, we do S.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require us to stay at 9, only to reach it at turn51.\n\nTherefore, we output the 10 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: S\n}\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We said H=10 is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, could we do 9 actions by going faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So no.\n\nOr by waiting sometimes? That would only increase H.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that at every turn from 43 to 51 we are safe. At turn51 we are at 9, safe. From 43 to 50 we are on freeways 1 to 8 respectively, and we checked each is safe.\n\nOne more thing: freeway5,6,7 have two cars. We checked both for freeway5 at turn47, freeway6 at turn48, freeway7 at turn49, and freeway8 at turn50.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=48. I need to get to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical position y ranges from 0 to 9, so freeways are at y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThe player moves each turn by choosing an action: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). But y must stay within 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the position of the car on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, collision occurs when x=0 is covered by a car on the same y-level at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to \\( y_{T+1} \\neq y_{T} \\) at turn \\( T \\), you will NOT be considered to be on \\( y_{T+1} \\) at turn \\( T \\), thus will NOT be collided by cars on \\( y_{T+1} \\) if \\( 0 \\in \\text{Span}(T) \\) but \\( 0 \\notin \\text{Span}(T+1) \\).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, when you take the action, you are still on y_T during that turn. After the action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo, during turn T, you are on y_T, and you might collide with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen, after moving, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and you check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision is checked based on the car positions at the exact turn.\n\nNow, for the cars, each has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The span is given, and it moves left or right based on direction.\n\nFor left-moving: span moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nFor right-moving: span moves right, positions increase.\n\nThe span is defined with head and tail. For left-moving, head is larger, tail smaller? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" with τ tail, h head? No.\n\nLook back at the update rules.\n\nIt says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn left-moving, [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn right-moving, [τ, h] with τ tail, h head, and both increase.\n\nIn the freeway 1 entry: (48, 37, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48]? But it says (48, 37, right, 3), which might be (head, tail, direction, speed) or (h, τ, d, s)?\n\nI think it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, the span should be [tail, head] with tail < head, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). 48 and 37, 48>37, so if it's (head, tail), then for right-moving, tail should be less than head, so Span = [tail, head] = [37, 48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nIn freeway 5: (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12) — two cars.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, t1=48, current turn.\n\nI need to find actions from turn t1=48 onwards to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is the top, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. Collision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0, which is safe.\n\nGoal is to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nBut to get there, I need to go through freeways y=1 to 8, and avoid collisions.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but since I want to minimize turns, and I need to go from 0 to 9, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns if no cars would be 9 actions of U, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns: at turn t, y_t = t - t1 for t from t1 to t1+8, y=0 to 8, then at t1+9, y=9.\n\nStart at t1, y=0.\n\nAfter action at t1, y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy.\n\nAt turn t1, position is (0, y_t1) = (0,0).\n\nAfter action a_t1, y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0, y_{t1+1}).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need y_{t1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and after H actions, y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\ny_{t1} = 0\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = 0 + Δy1\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + H -1} + Δy_{H-1}\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince y_{t1} = 0, the sum of Δy from t=0 to H-1 should be 9.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so to minimize H, we want as many U as possible, but we may need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from t1 to t1+H-1, H actions, and at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to reach as fast as possible.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to delay or go down sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t1=48.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with their spans at t1.\n\nFor a given turn T, I can compute the span for each car on each freeway.\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on freeway k (y=k, for k=1 to 8), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, if any car covers 0 at turn T on that y-level.\n\nNow, for freeway k, the car state is given.\n\nList all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3)\n\nSince d=right, span at t1=48 is [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt turn T, span = [37 + 3*(T-48), 48 + 3*(T-48)] because right-moving, τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nh and τ: (-48, -59), d=right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 6*(T-48), -48 + 6*(T-48)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 6) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span at t1: [37,48]? [τ=37, h=48] for right-moving.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), span at t1: [τ=-11, h=0] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T: for first car: [37 + 12*(T-48), 48 + 12*(T-48)]\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 12*(T-48), 0 + 12*(T-48)] = [-11 +12*(T-48), 12*(T-48)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at t1: [τ=-59, h=-48] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +12*(T-48), -48 +12*(T-48)]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), same as above, span at T: [-11 +12*(T-48), 12*(T-48)]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t1=48.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe shortest path is to go up every turn, but I need to check if at some point, when I'm on a freeway, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince I go up, y increases by 1 each turn if I always do U.\n\nBut I might need to do S or D to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's find when each freeway is dangerous, i.e., when a car covers x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k and turn T, if player is on y=k at turn T, collision if 0 in some car's span on k at T.\n\nSo for each k, find the set of T where 0 is covered by some car on k.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving, at each turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, it must not be that T is dangerous for y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, which depends on actions.\n\nBut to plan the sequence, I need to consider the path.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find for each y-level, the times when it is safe to be there.\n\nBut the safety depends on the turn T, not on when I arrive, because cars move continuously.\n\nFor each freeway k, find the times T where collision occurs if player is on k at T.\n\nThat is, for k, if there exists a car on k such that 0 in span at T.\n\nIf not, then safe at T for k.\n\nOtherwise, unsafe.\n\nThen, for the player, at turn T, if y_T = k for k=1-8, it must be safe for k at T.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, always safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each k the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car with span at T: [37 + 3(T-48), 48 + 3(T-48)]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 3(T-48) <= 0 <= 48 + 3(T-48)\n\nLet t_rel = T - 48, so from turn 48 onwards.\n\nAt T, t_rel = T - 48.\n\nSpan: [37 + 3 t_rel, 48 + 3 t_rel]\n\n0 in [37+3t_rel, 48+3t_rel] if 37+3t_rel <= 0 and 0 <= 48+3t_rel\n\nSince 37+3t_rel <= 0 implies 3t_rel <= -37, t_rel <= -37/3 ≈ -12.333, but t_rel >=0, so 37+3t_rel >=37>0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in [lower, upper] since lower >0.\n\nSimilarly, upper=48+3t_rel >=48>0, so 0 < lower <= upper, so 0 not in interval. Thus, for freeway 1, at all T>=48, 0 not covered, so always safe.\n\nIs that right? Lower bound 37+3t_rel >=37>0, so the span is always positive, x=0 is not covered. Yes.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: car span at T: [-59 + 6 t_rel, -48 + 6 t_rel] with t_rel = T-48\n\n0 in span if -59 +6t_rel <= 0 <= -48 +6t_rel\n\nWhich is -59 +6t_rel <=0 and 0<= -48 +6t_rel\n\nFirst: -59 +6t_rel <=0 => 6t_rel <=59 => t_rel <= 59/6 ≈9.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6t_rel => 6t_rel >=48 => t_rel >=8\n\nSo t_rel between 8 and 9.833, so T between 48+8=56 and 48+9=57? t_rel=8: T=56, t_rel=9: T=57, t_rel=9.833 T=57.833, but turns integer, so T=56 and 57.\n\nAt T=56: t_rel=8, span: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\n-59 +6*8 = -59+48= -11\n\n-48 +48=0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, since upper=0.\n\nSimilarly, T=57: t_rel=9, span: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5, 6], so 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nT=58: t_rel=10, [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, T=55: t_rel=7, [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=56 and T=57 for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car, so unsafe at T=56,57.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=56,57.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [37 +12 t_rel, 48 +12 t_rel]\n\nAs before, lower=37+12t_rel >=37>0, so 0 not in, always safe from this car.\n\nSecond car: span at T: [-11 +12 t_rel, 0 +12 t_rel] = [-11 +12 t_rel, 12 t_rel]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12 t_rel <= 0 <= 12 t_rel\n\nNow, 0 <= 12 t_rel always true for t_rel >=0.\n\n-11 +12 t_rel <=0 => 12 t_rel <=11 => t_rel <= 11/12 ≈0.916\n\nBut t_rel >=0 integer, t_rel=0: -11 +0 <=0, true, and 0<=0, true.\n\nt_rel=1: -11+12=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nAt t_rel=0, T=48, span: [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt_rel=1, T=49, span: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span only at t_rel=0, T=48.\n\nBut at T=48, if player on y=5, collision.\n\nNow, for freeway 5, collision if either car covers 0.\n\nFirst car never, second car at T=48.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=48 for freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, unsafe at T=48.\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe at T=48.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at T: [-59 +12 t_rel, -48 +12 t_rel]\n\n0 in span if -59+12t_rel <=0 <= -48+12t_rel\n\nWhich is -59+12t_rel <=0 and 0<= -48+12t_rel\n\nFirst: -59+12t_rel <=0 => 12t_rel <=59 => t_rel <=59/12≈4.916\n\nSecond: 0<= -48+12t_rel => 12t_rel >=48 => t_rel >=4\n\nSo t_rel between 4 and 4.916, so T=48+4=52 and T=48+4=52? t_rel=4: T=52, t_rel=5: T=53, but t_rel=4.916, so T=52 only? Let's see.\n\nt_rel=4: span: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nt_rel=5: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt_rel=4.916 not integer, so only at T=52, unsafe from first car.\n\nNow second car: (0,-11,right,12), same as before, span at T: [-11+12t_rel, 12t_rel]\n\n0 in span only at t_rel=0, T=48, as before.\n\nFor freeway 8, unsafe if either car covers 0.\n\nAt T=48: second car covers 0.\n\nAt T=52: first car covers 0.\n\nOther times? For example, T=49: second car span [1,12], no; first car span [-59+12, -48+12]? t_rel=1, [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], no.\n\nT=50: t_rel=2, first car [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], no; second car [-11+24,24]=[13,24], no.\n\nT=51: similar.\n\nT=52: first car [-11,0], covers 0; second car [-11+48,48]? t_rel=4, -11+12*4=-11+48=37, 12*4=48, so [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=52, only first car covers 0.\n\nAt T=48, only second car covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at T=48 and T=52.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=56,57\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=56,57\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=56,57\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=48\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=48\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=48\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=48 and T=52\n\nNow, player starts at turn T=48, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 9, if I can go straight up without hitting unsafe times.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nAt turn T=48, y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe, but I start at y=0.\n\nIf I go up immediately:\n\nTurn T=48: at y=0, safe. Action a_{48}: I can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, then at turn T=49, I will be on y=1.\n\ny=1 is always safe, as we saw.\n\nIf I choose S, stay at y=0, or D, but D to y=-1 not allowed, since y>=0, so D not possible at y=0. Similarly, at y=9, U not possible.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, D or S, not U.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nSuppose I always go U when possible.\n\nStart T=48, y=0, action U: then y_{49} =1\n\nTurn T=49: position y=1, which is freeway 1, safe always. Action U: y_{50}=2\n\nT=50: y=2, freeway 2. Is it safe? Unsafe at T=56,57, but T=50, not 56 or 57, so safe. Action U: y_{51}=3\n\nT=51: y=3, freeway 3. Similarly, unsafe only at 56,57, T=51 safe. U: y_{52}=4\n\nT=52: y=4, freeway 4. Unsafe at 56,57, not 52, safe. Action U: y_{53}=5\n\nT=53: y=5, freeway 5. Unsafe at T=48, but T=53>48, so safe? Freeway 5 unsafe only at T=48, as per earlier.\n\nAt T=53, y=5, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 5: cars, at T=53, t_rel=5.\n\nFirst car: [37 +12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], not near 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12*5, 12*5] = [-11+60,60]=[49,60], not 0.\n\nSo yes, safe. Action U: y_{54}=6\n\nT=54: y=6, freeway 6. Similarly, unsafe only at T=48, T=54 safe. U: y_{55}=7\n\nT=55: y=7, freeway 7. Unsafe only at T=48, safe. U: y_{56}=8\n\nNow T=56: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=48 and T=52.\n\nT=56, is it safe?\n\nAt T=56, t_rel=8.\n\nFirst car: [-59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11 +12*8, 12*8] = [-11+96,96] = [85,96], not 0.\n\nSo safe? But freeway 8 also has unsafe at T=56? No, from earlier, freeway 8 unsafe only at T=48 and T=52.\n\nT=52 was unsafe, T=56 should be safe.\n\nIn my summary, y=8 unsafe at T=48 and T=52.\n\nT=56 not listed, so safe.\n\nAction U: y_{57}=9\n\nT=57: y=9, which is not a freeway, safe. And we reached y=9 at turn T=57.\n\nH is the number of turns from start? Let's see the actions.\n\nStarted at T=48, y=0.\n\nActions:\n\na_{48}: U, to y=1 at T=49\n\na_{49}: U, to y=2 at T=50\n\na_{50}: U, to y=3 at T=51\n\na_{51}: U, to y=4 at T=52\n\nT=52: y=4, which is freeway 4, and we said unsafe at T=56,57, not T=52, so safe.\n\nThen a_{52}: U? T=52 position y=4, action U, so y_{53}=5\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn T=52: position y=4, action a_{52}, then y_{53} = y_4 + Δy =4 +1=5 if U.\n\nThen T=53: y=5, action U, y_{54}=6\n\nT=54: y=6, U, y_{55}=7\n\nT=55: y=7, U, y_{56}=8\n\nT=56: y=8, action U, y_{57}=9\n\nNow at T=56, y=8, we need to check if collision.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=56: as above, cars not covering 0, so safe.\n\nThen after U, at T=57, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, how many actions? From a_{48} to a_{56}, that's 9 actions: t=48 to 56, which is 9 turns? Indices.\n\nTurn t1=48, actions from a_{48} to a_{48+H-1}, and after H actions, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nHere, actions: a_{48}, a_{49}, a_{50}, a_{51}, a_{52}, a_{53}, a_{54}, a_{55}, a_{56} — that's 9 actions.\n\nAfter a_{56}, y_{57} = y_{56} + Δy = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAnd T=57, y=9.\n\nNow, during the path, were there any unsafe positions?\n\nT=48: y=0, safe\n\nT=49: y=1, safe\n\nT=50: y=2, safe (not 56 or 57)\n\nT=51: y=3, safe\n\nT=52: y=4, safe (freeway 4 unsafe at 56,57, not 52)\n\nT=53: y=5, safe (freeway 5 unsafe only at 48)\n\nT=54: y=6, safe\n\nT=55: y=7, safe\n\nT=56: y=8, safe (freeway 8 unsafe at 48 and 52, not 56)\n\nT=57: y=9, safe\n\nSo all safe, and reached in 9 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9 actions, from y=0 to y=9, minimum possible since each U increases y by 1, and S or D would increase H, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it seems to work.\n\nEarlier I thought about freeway 8 at T=52 unsafe, but in this path, at T=52, I was on y=4, not y=8.\n\ny=8 was at T=56, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=48, I was on y=0, not on freeways.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 4 at T=52.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, unsafe at T=56,57.\n\nAt T=52, is it safe? Freeway 4 has car (-48,-59,right,6), at T=52, t_rel=4.\n\nSpan: [-59 +6*4, -48 +6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], not include 0, so safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, unsafe at T=48, but I wasn't there at T=48.\n\nSo this sequence should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nIn this case, all actions are U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nStart turn t1=48.\n\nAction a_{48} = U\n\nThen turn t1+1=49, a_{49}=U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+8=56, a_{56}=U\n\nAfter that, at turn 57, position (0,9)\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H=9 actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nBut is there any issue at turn 52?\n\nAt turn 52, I am on y=4, action U, moving to y=5 at next turn.\n\nBut during turn 52, I am on y=4, which is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at some point I need to avoid, but in this case, no.\n\nBut let me see freeway 8 at T=52.\n\nAt T=52, freeway 8 is unsafe, but I am not on it; I am on y=4 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at T=48, freeway 5,6,7,8 unsafe, but I start at y=0.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case, H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach faster? No, because from y=0 to y=9, must increase by 9, each U increases by 1, so minimum 9 actions.\n\nIf I do S or D, it takes more turns, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut the player position is given at (0,0) at turn t1=48.\n\nIn the sequence, actions start from t1.\n\nNow, about the cars: for freeway 8, at T=52, it is unsafe, but since I'm not there, ok.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the position and action.\n\nTurn | Position at start of turn | Action | New position after action (for next turn)\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, then choose action, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, if y_T between 1-8, and car on y_T covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nT=48: y=0, action U, y_{49}=1 (safe, y=0)\n\nT=49: y=1, action U, y_{50}=2 (y=1 safe)\n\nT=50: y=2, action U, y_{51}=3 (y=2 safe at T=50)\n\nT=51: y=3, action U, y_{52}=4 (y=3 safe)\n\nT=52: y=4, action U, y_{53}=5 (y=4 safe at T=52)\n\nT=53: y=5, action U, y_{54}=6 (y=5 safe at T=53)\n\nT=54: y=6, action U, y_{55}=7 (y=6 safe)\n\nT=55: y=7, action U, y_{56}=8 (y=7 safe)\n\nT=56: y=8, action U, y_{57}=9 (y=8 safe at T=56)\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps at T=56, y=8, freeway 8, but as computed, cars not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 5,6,7, at T=48, unsafe, but I wasn't there.\n\nOne thing: at T=48, if I had gone to y=5 immediately, but I started at y=0, and to go to y=5, I need multiple turns.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=5 at T=48, but I start at y=0, so impossible.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all U actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\" etc., but here t1=48.\n\nPerhaps write as:\n\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\n...\nTurn 56: U\n\nSince H=9, from turn 48 to 56.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to do something else, but seems not.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by moving up slower, but that would take more turns, not faster.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, H increases.\n\nSo minimal is 9.\n\nBut just to be sure, is there a freeway that is unsafe at other times?\n\nFor example, freeway 2,3,4 unsafe at T=56,57.\n\nIn my path, at T=56, I am on y=8, which is different freeway.\n\ny=2,3,4 are unsafe at T=56,57, but in my sequence, at T=56, I am on y=8, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=57, I am on y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nIf I were on y=4 at T=56, it would be unsafe, but I was on y=4 at T=52, not T=56.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\nThe unsafe times for each freeway (when a car covers \\(x = 0\\)) are:\n- Freeway 1: Always safe.\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at turns 56 and 57.\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at turns 56 and 57 (same as freeway 2).\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at turns 56 and 57.\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe only at turn 48.\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe only at turn 48 (same as freeway 5).\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe only at turn 48 (same as freeway 5).\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns 48 and 52.\n\n### Optimal Path\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\) is 9, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no shorter path is possible. The sequence of all \"U\" actions avoids all unsafe times:\n- At turn 48, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- At turns 49–55, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 7\\) respectively, all safe because:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) is always safe.\n  - \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe only at turns 56–57, but these turns are not reached until later, and the player is not on these freeways at unsafe times.\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) are unsafe only at turn 48, but the player is on these freeways at turns 53, 54, and 55, which are safe.\n- At turn 56, the player is at \\(y = 8\\), which is safe at turn 56 (unsafe only at turns 48 and 52).\n- After the action at turn 56, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 57 (safe, not a freeway).\n\nThus, \\(H = 9\\) is achievable and minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions from turn 48 to turn 56 (9 actions) is all \"U\":\n\n```\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n```\n\nAfter these actions, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 57.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=54, and I start at y=0. The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the car state table. For each freeway, there are cars with their positions at turn t1=54.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. Tail is τ, head is h.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], and for left-moving, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. But all cars here are right-moving, so I'll use the right-moving formula.\n\nAlso, collision occurs at turn T if I'm on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, I'm at y_T, and I consider the cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, the car spans are given for turn t1=54, so for any future turn T, I can compute the span.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 54.\n\nSo for a car with initial head h, tail τ, speed s, right-moving, span at T is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt].\n\nCollision if y_T = k and 0 ∈ span for some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, if I take action to go to y_{T+1}, I am still on y_T during turn T, and only move to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I check cars on freeway y_T.\n\nIf I move, I won't be on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9. Since I can only change y by -1, 0, or +1 each turn, the minimum number of turns is 9 if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more.\n\nBut since I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and I can only move up or down one at a time, the shortest path in terms of moves is 9 up moves, but I might have to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut I need the minimal H.\n\nAlso, y is from 0 to 9, so I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, let's look at the car positions.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, one car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3.\n\nAt Δt=0, span [37,48]\n\nAs Δt increases, since moving right, the span moves to the right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nτ=-59, h=-48? Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail. Here, τ=-59, h=-48, so h > τ, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) — but it says \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\", and in the table, it's listed as one car? Let me see the table.\n\nIn the car state:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\nk=1: (48,37,right,3) — one car\n\nk=2: (-48,-59,right,6) — one car? It says \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" , probably one car.\n\nk=3: same as k=2? \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" — identical to k=2?\n\nk=4: \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" — same.\n\nk=5: \"(48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\" — two cars.\n\nSimilarly k=6: same as k=5? \"(48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\"\n\nk=7: same\n\nk=8: \"(-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\" — different.\n\nLet's list clearly:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3)\n\n- Freeway 2: one car: (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6) — h=-48, τ=-59, so since moving right, head is right, so at t1, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2: (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3: (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12) and (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as k=5: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12) and (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nBecause collision occurs only if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is in some car's span on k at that turn.\n\nSo for each k, I need to find the times when 0 is covered by a car on k.\n\nThen, for each turn T, and for each y, I can see if it's safe to be on y at turn T.\n\nBut since I control the movement, I need to choose actions to avoid being on a freeway when 0 is occupied.\n\nNow, since the cars move continuously, but the grid is discrete in time, I think we only care about integer turns.\n\nSo for each freeway, for each car, find the time intervals when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince the span moves linearly, it will be an interval.\n\nFirst, let's define Δt = T - 54.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial τ, h, s, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt\n\nSince h and τ could be negative or positive.\n\nSo inequality: τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s*Δt\n\nWhich is: s*Δt ≤ -τ and s*Δt ≥ -h\n\nSince s > 0, Δt ≥ ceil( -h / s ) ? Let's solve.\n\nFrom τ + s*Δt ≤ 0, so s*Δt ≤ -τ, so Δt ≤ floor( -τ / s ) ? Better to write inequalities.\n\nτ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s*Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ ceil( (-τ)/s ) ? No.\n\nLet's keep it as:\n\nτ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ Δt ≤ (-τ)/s\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ h + s*Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ (-h)/s\n\nSince Δt integer, we need to find integer Δt such that:\n\nmax( ceil( (-h)/s ) , something ) let's think carefully.\n\nThe condition is:\n\n(-h)/s ≤ Δt ≤ (-τ)/s\n\nBecause from Δt ≥ (-h)/s and Δt ≤ (-τ)/s\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nΔt ≥ (-h)/s  (since 0 ≤ h + s*Δt ⇒ s*Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h/s)\n\nAnd Δt ≤ (-τ)/s  (from τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s*Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ/s)\n\nSo Δt must satisfy:\n\nceil( -h/s ) ≤ Δt ≤ floor( -τ/s )\n\nSince Δt integer.\n\nFor example, if -h/s is not integer, ceil(-h/s) is the smallest integer >= -h/s.\n\nSimilarly, floor(-τ/s) is the largest integer <= -τ/s.\n\nThen if ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s), there is an interval where 0 is in span.\n\nOtherwise, not.\n\nLet's apply for each car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, one car: h=48, τ=37, s=3\n\nThen Δt >= (-h)/s = (-48)/3 = -16\n\nΔt <= (-τ)/s = (-37)/3 ≈ -12.333\n\nSo Δt >= -16 and Δt <= -12.333, since Δt integer, Δt <= -13? Let's compute.\n\n- h/s = -48/3 = -16\n\n- τ/s = -37/3 ≈ -12.333\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-16) = -16\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-12.333) = -13? floor of -12.333 is -13? No.\n\nfloor(x) is greatest integer <= x.\n\n-12.333, integers less than or equal: -13, -14, ..., but -13 = -13.0 < -12.333? -13.0 is less than -12.333, since -13 < -12.333.\n\nNumbers: -13.0 < -12.333 < -12.0\n\nSo floor(-12.333) = -13, because -13 <= -12.333 < -12, so floor is -13.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-16) = -16.\n\nNow, Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-16) = -16\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-37/3) = floor(-12.333) = -13\n\nNow, -16 <= Δt <= -13\n\nBut Δt = T - 54, and T is future turn, so Δt >=0 for future, I think.\n\nWe are at t1=54, and we care about T >= t1, so Δt >=0.\n\nFor Δt >=0, -16 <= Δt <= -13 is impossible since Δt >=0 > -13? -13 is negative, 0 is greater.\n\n-16 to -13 are all negative, so for Δt >=0, this interval is empty.\n\nSo for freeway 1, for this car, at Δt >=0, 0 is never in the span because the car is at [37 +3Δt, 48 +3Δt], which at Δt=0 is [37,48], all positive, and moving right, so 0 is always left of the span, so never covered. So no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: car h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/6 = 48/6 = 8\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/6 = 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(8) = 8\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) = 9\n\nSo Δt >=8 and Δt <=9\n\nSo at Δt=8 and Δt=9, 0 is in the span.\n\nΔt = T-54, so at T=54+8=62 and T=63, 0 is covered on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3: same car as freeway 2, so same: at T=62 and T=63, unsafe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, at T=62,63 unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=12\n\n- h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\n- τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nΔt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-37/12) = floor(-3.083) = -4? -3.083, floor is -4 since -4 <= -3.083 < -3\n\nceil(-4) = -4\n\nSo Δt >= -4 and Δt <= -4, so only at Δt=-4, but Δt=-4 is past, T=54-4=50, not relevant for future.\n\nSo this car never covers 0 for Δt >=0.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\n- h/s = -0/12 = 0\n\n- τ/s = -(-11)/12 = 11/12 ≈ 0.9167\n\nΔt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(0) = 0\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(11/12) = floor(0.9167) = 0\n\nSo Δt >=0 and Δt <=0, so at Δt=0, T=54, 0 is in span.\n\nNow, at T=54, for freeway 5, this car has span [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since tail -11, head 0, so 0 is the head.\n\nSo at exactly T=54, on freeway 5, 0 is occupied.\n\nBut we are at turn t1=54, and we start at position (0,0), which is not on freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 is not a freeway, I think.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nIn the problem: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1, ..., 8\"\n\nAnd player position: at (0, y_t), with y_t vertical axis.\n\nAlso, collision occurs only on freeways, so when y_t between 1 and 8.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=54, if I am on freeway 5, which is y=5, but I am at y=0, so not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut for the car, at T=54, on freeway 5, car at [-11,0], so 0 is occupied, but since I'm not on y=5, it doesn't affect me.\n\nNow, back to freeway 5: the second car at Δt=0 covers 0, but for future, Δt>=1, it doesn't cover.\n\nFor Δt=0, but since we start at T=54, and we take actions from t=54 onwards, at T=54, I am at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nSo for freeway 5, first car never covers 0, second car covers only at Δt=0, which is not future, so for T>54, no car covers 0 on freeway 5? Let me confirm.\n\nSecond car: at Δt=0, span [-11,0], covers 0.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=55, span [ -11 +12*1, 0 +12*1] = [1,12], which is 1 to 12, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly for later times.\n\nFirst car at Δt=0: [37,48], not cover 0.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only at T=54, 0 is covered, but T=54 is current turn, and I'm not on it, so for future turns, freeway 5 is always safe? But at T=54, it is occupied, but since I'm not there, and for T>54, not occupied, so yes, freeway 5 is safe at all future times.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same as freeway 5: two cars, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSame as above: second car covers 0 only at T=54, so for T>54, freeway 6 safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same, safe for T>54.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12)\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/12 = 48/12 = 4\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/12 = 59/12 ≈ 4.9167\n\nΔt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(4) = 4\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(59/12) = floor(4.9167) = 4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and <=4, so at Δt=4, T=54+4=58, 0 is covered.\n\nSecond car on freeway 8: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12)\n\nSame as before: at Δt=0, covers 0, but for future, not.\n\nSo for freeway 8, at T=58, first car covers 0, and second car does not cover for T>54.\n\nSo at T=58, on freeway 8, 0 is occupied by first car.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when 0 is occupied:\n\n- Freeway 1: never occupied\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at T=62,63\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied at T=62,63\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied at T=62,63\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied only at T=54, not future, so safe for T>54\n\n- Freeway 6: same as 5, safe for T>54\n\n- Freeway 7: same, safe for T>54\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at T=58 (only at Δt=4)\n\nAlso, at T=54, freeway 5,6,7 have cars at 0, but since I'm not there, ok.\n\nNow, for freeway 2,3,4 occupied at T=62 and 63.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=58.\n\nOthers are safe.\n\nBut freeway 1 is always safe, freeway 5,6,7 safe after T=54.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=54 to y=9 at some turn, with minimal turns.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe path: I start at T=54, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach turn, I can go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut moving down from y=0 might not be possible? y_t in [0,9], so if at y=0, I can only go up or stay, not down, because y_{t+1} >=0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, can only go down or stay.\n\nBut I start at y=0, so initially, I can go U or S.\n\nSimilarly, end at y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nThe occupied times are:\n\nFor y=2,3,4: occupied at T=62,63\n\ny=8 occupied at T=58\n\ny=1,5,6,7 always safe after T=54.\n\ny=1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, T=58 is soon, in 4 turns from now.\n\nT=54 to T=58 is 4 turns later, so at turn T=58.\n\nSimilarly, T=62 is 8 turns later, T=63 is 9 turns later.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimum moves: if I go up every turn, I can reach y=9 in 9 turns, at T=54+8=62? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=54, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at T=55, y could be 0 or 1.\n\nAfter t actions, at turn T=54 + t, y_t = y_{54} + sum of actions, but actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet t=0 at turn 54.\n\nSo at time t (after t actions), turn is 54 + t, position y_t.\n\nStart: t=0, turn=54, y=0\n\nAfter first action a_{54}, at turn=55, y_1 = y_0 + Δy, with Δy based on a_{54}\n\nThe sequence: actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=54, so actions a_{54}, a_{55}, ..., up to a_{54 + H -1}\n\nThen at turn after actions, at turn 54 + H, y_H =9.\n\nThe position at turn T: for turn T, y_T is position at that turn.\n\nAt turn T=54, y=0\n\nAfter action a_{54}, at turn T=55, y_{55} = y_{54} + Δy_{54}\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, y_T is determined by previous y and action.\n\nNow, to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is if I go up every turn: from y=0 to y=1 at T=55, y=2 at T=56, ..., y=9 at T=63.\n\nBecause at T=54, y=0; after first up, T=55, y=1; ... after 9th up, T=63, y=9.\n\nT=54: y=0\n\nT=55: y=1\n\nT=56: y=2\n\n...\n\nT=63: y=9\n\nSo at T=63, I reach y=9.\n\nBut at T=63, freeways y=2,3,4 are occupied, but I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no problem. I don't need to be on freeway at that turn.\n\nThe issue is during the path, when I am on y=1 to 8, I need to not be there when it is occupied.\n\nIn this path, I would be:\n\nAt T=55, on y=1: freeway 1, which is always safe.\n\nT=56, y=2: freeway 2, which is occupied at T=62,63, but T=56 is early, so safe.\n\nT=57, y=3: freeway 3, occupied at T=62,63, T=57 safe.\n\nT=58, y=4: freeway 4, occupied at T=62,63, but T=58 is not 62 or 63, so safe? Freeway 4 occupied only at T=62,63, so at T=58, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=59, y=5: freeway 5, safe\n\nT=60, y=6: freeway 6, safe\n\nT=61, y=7: freeway 7, safe\n\nT=62, y=8: freeway 8, occupied at T=58? T=58 is different.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied only at T=58.\n\nAt T=62, freeway 8: is it occupied?\n\nFor freeway 8, we have only at T=58 it is occupied, at other times not.\n\nAt T=62, y=8, freeway 8: not occupied, since only at T=58.\n\nBut freeways 2,3,4 occupied at T=62,63, but at T=62 I am on y=8, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, T=63, I am on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nIn this path, when I am on each freeway:\n\nT=55: y=1, safe\n\nT=56: y=2, safe (since occupied only at 62,63)\n\nT=57: y=3, safe\n\nT=58: y=4, safe? Freeway 4 occupied at T=62,63, not at T=58.\n\nT=59: y=5, safe\n\nT=60: y=6, safe\n\nT=61: y=7, safe\n\nT=62: y=8, freeway 8: occupied only at T=58, not at T=62, so safe.\n\nT=63: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo actually, with 9 up moves starting at T=54, I reach y=9 at T=63, and all intermediate positions are safe.\n\nIs that right? At T=58, I am on y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 is occupied only at T=62 and 63, not at T=58, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=62, I am on y=8, freeway 8 not occupied at T=62, only at T=58.\n\nAnd y=2,3,4 occupied at T=62, but I am not there.\n\nSo this path seems safe with H=9 turns: actions from t=0 to 8, 9 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 8, that's 9 actions, from a_{54} to a_{62}, and at turn T=63, y=9.\n\nTurn after last action is turn 54 + H.\n\nAfter H actions, turn is 54 + H.\n\nAt turn 54 + H, position is after H actions.\n\nStart: turn 54, before any action, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{54}, at turn 55, y = 0 + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{54 + k}, at turn 55 + k, position y.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 54 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nWith all up, from y=0, after 9 up, y=9 at turn 54+9=63.\n\nAnd as above, all intermediate turns are safe.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can I reach y=9 before T=63?\n\nMinimum turns: since I start at y=0, to reach y=9, I need at least 9 up moves, so minimum H=9.\n\nWith any other actions, if I stay or go down, it would take more turns, so H>=9, and with all up, it works, so H=9 should be minimal.\n\nBut in the path above, at T=58, when I am at y=4, freeway 4 is safe, and freeway 8 is occupied at T=58, but I am at y=4, not y=8.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 8 occupation.\n\nFreeway 8: at T=58, Δt=4, first car: span [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-59 +12*4, -48 +12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\nτ=-59, h=-48, s=12, Δt=4\n\nτ + sΔt = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nh + sΔt = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included.\n\nSecond car: at T=58, but second car only at Δt=0 it covers 0, at Δt=4, span [ -11 +12*4, 0 +12*4] = [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], not cover 0.\n\nSo at T=58, freeway 8 has car at [-11,0], so 0 occupied.\n\nBut in the path, at T=58, I am at y=4, not y=8, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, at T=62, freeway 2: car span at Δt=8, τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nτ + sΔt = -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nh + sΔt = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 occupied.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4 at T=62 and 63.\n\nBut in the path, at T=62, I am at y=8, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=63, I am at y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nAnd with H=9, it works.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by moving differently, but since I need to increase y by 9, I need at least 9 up moves, so H at least 9, so it is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, with all up actions, it is safe.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nFrom turn 54 to turn 62, actions a_{54} to a_{62}, all U.\n\nThen at turn 63, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=9, actions a_{54} to a_{62}, and at turn 63, position.\n\nBut the turn when I reach is turn 63.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut is there any issue at the start?\n\nAt turn 54, I am at y=0, and I take action a_{54}.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at turn 55.\n\nIf stay, y=0 at turn 55.\n\nBut in this case, I go up.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be unsafe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and if I take action to change y, I am not on the new y until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5,6,7, at T=54 they are occupied, but I am not on them at T=54.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=5 at T=59, which is after T=54, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=9 with all up actions is fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=9.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier by starting with stay or something, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for some turns, then go up, I reach later, so H larger.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, not possible from y=0.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 at an earlier turn if I go up faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves, so at turn 63.\n\nUnless I start from a different position, but I start at y=0.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 at T=58.\n\nAt T=58, freeway 8 occupied, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, at T=62, freeway 2,3,4 occupied, but I am on y=8 or y=9.\n\nIn the path at T=62, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, and at T=62, is freeway 8 occupied?\n\nFreeway 8: we said occupied only at T=58.\n\nAt T=62, Δt=8, freeway 8 first car: τ + sΔt = -59 +12*8 = -59 + 96 = 37\n\nh + sΔt = -48 + 96 = 48, so [37,48], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: τ + sΔt = -11 + 12*8 = -11 + 96 = 85, h + sΔt = 0 + 96 = 96, [85,96], not cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=62, freeway 2: as above, [ -11,0], covered.\n\nBut I am on y=8.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all up actions.\n\nSo the sequence: for t from 0 to 8, action U.\n\nThat is, a_{54} = U, a_{55} = U, ..., a_{62} = U.\n\nThen at turn 63, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 8: a_{t_1+8} = U\n\nSince t_1=54, t_1 +8 =62.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to 8, that's 9 actions, turns 54 to 62.\n\nAfter that, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn t_1 + H, which is 63.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, it should be for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\" ? No.\n\nLet's see: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\" or after actions.\n\nAfter the sequence, at turn (t1 + t) for t=H-1, but the position after last action.\n\nAfter performing actions from t=0 to H-1, at turn (t1 + H -1) + something.\n\nDefine:\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t} for t=0, at turn t1 +1, position y_{t1+1}\n\nGenerally, after action a_{T} at turn T, position at turn T+1.\n\nThe sequence: actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H -1}, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn this case, t1=54, H=9, so after a_{54 + 8} = a_{62}, at turn 63, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: a_{54} to a_{62}, all U.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and H=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? That would require reaching y=9 at turn 62.\n\nBut from y=0 at turn 54, to y=9 at turn 62, that would require 8 moves, but each move changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, delta y=9, so at least 9 actions, so impossible to reach before turn 63.\n\nTurn 54: y=0\n\nAfter 1 action, turn 55: y<=1\n\nAfter 2 actions, turn 56: y<=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, turn 54+k: y <= k\n\nTo have y=9, need turn 54+k >= 54+9=63, so earliest at turn 63.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nAnd achievable with all up, as above.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5,6,7, at T=54, they have cars at 0, but since I start moving later, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at any point I cross an occupied freeway.\n\nAnother thing: when I move from one y to another, I am only on one y per turn, so no issue with multiple freeways.\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 2,3,4 at T=62,63.\n\nBut I avoid them by being elsewhere.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all up actions.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U  (to y=4, freeway 4 safe at T=58)\n\nTurn 59: U  (y=5, freeway 5 safe)\n\nTurn 60: U  (y=6, freeway 6 safe)\n\nTurn 61: U  (y=7, freeway 7 safe)\n\nTurn 62: U  (y=8, freeway 8 safe at T=62)\n\nThen at turn 63, y=9.\n\nAll actions U.\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the sequence, not H explicitly.\n\nBut I think H is implied.\n\nPerhaps I need to state H.\n\nBut the format is to output the actions.\n\nNow, but in the car for freeway 8, at T=58, it is occupied, but I am at y=4 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nBut let me see if there is any other constraint.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nWhich I already considered.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by not going directly, but no, since I need to go up.\n\nUnless I go down first, but that would make H larger.\n\nFor example, if I go down from y=0, but I can't, y=0, I can only stay or up.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all up for 9 turns.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\n\nWith t_1=54.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 54\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving upward (U) every turn, resulting in the player reaching \\(y=9\\) at turn 63.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 54, move up to \\(y=1\\) at turn 55.\n- At turn 55, move up to \\(y=2\\) at turn 56.\n- At turn 56, move up to \\(y=3\\) at turn 57.\n- At turn 57, move up to \\(y=4\\) at turn 58.\n- At turn 58, move up to \\(y=5\\) at turn 59.\n- At turn 59, move up to \\(y=6\\) at turn 60.\n- At turn 60, move up to \\(y=7\\) at turn 61.\n- At turn 61, move up to \\(y=8\\) at turn 62.\n- At turn 62, move up to \\(y=9\\) at turn 63.\n\nThis path avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y=1\\) to \\(y=8\\):\n- Freeway 1 is always safe, as the car never covers position 0 for \\(T \\geq 55\\).\n- Freeways 2, 3, and 4 are occupied at turns 62 and 63, but the player is on \\(y=2\\) at turn 56, \\(y=3\\) at turn 57, and \\(y=4\\) at turn 58, all before the occupation times, so safe.\n- Freeways 5, 6, and 7 are safe for \\(T > 54\\), as occupation only occurs at \\(T=54\\) (not relevant for future turns).\n- Freeway 8 is occupied at turn 58, but the player is on \\(y=4\\) at turn 58 and reaches \\(y=8\\) at turn 62, after the occupation, so safe.\n\nSince the player must increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9, and each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, \\(H=9\\) is the minimum possible. Any deviation (e.g., staying or moving down) would increase \\(H\\), so this sequence is optimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=60 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on each freeway from 1 to 8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that exact turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, they are on y_T, and if they move to y_{T+1} at turn T, they won't be on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence of actions from turn t1=60 to some turn t1+H-1 where y reaches 9, and H is minimal.\n\nCurrent position: (0,0) at turn 60. I need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and since the grid is from 0 to 9, y=9 is the target. Freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. y=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the goal, neither has cars, so only when on y=1 to 8 do we need to worry about cars.\n\nIn the collision condition, it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And freeway y_T is the row the player is on at turn T.\n\nAlso, the player position is updated after action, so at turn T, after action, y_{T} is set, and that's where the player is for collision check at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t1=60.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, the car is moving right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (48, 37, right, 3). Head and tail, but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think, since it's moving right.\n\nHere head=48, tail=37, and direction right, so τ=37, h=48? The notation is a bit messy. In the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). Since direction is right, and head=48, tail=37, so at t1, span is from τ to h, so [37, 48]? But in the update, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it would be decreasing.\n\nBut all cars here seem to be right-moving except possibly some, but let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, s=3 → so at t1, the car covers from 37 to 48 inclusive? Spans are continuous, I assume, so positions from 37 to 48.\n\nThen at time T, since moving right, position increases.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) → head=-48, tail=-59? tail -59, head -48, so if right-moving, tail should be less than head, here tail=-59, head=-48, so -59 < -48, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at T, [ -59 + 6(T-t1), -48 + 6(T-t1) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 6) — it says the same as freeway 2? But freeway is different, so separate cars.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-48, -59, right, 6), same as freeway 2? That seems odd, but possible, multiple freeways can have cars.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8 has different first car.\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have 0 in their span at various turns.\n\nSince the player starts at y=0 at turn 60, and needs to go to y=9, they must pass through each y from 1 to 8, but can skip some if moving fast, but since each move changes y by at most 1, they have to go through each integer y step by step.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 up moves, but they can stay or go down, so H could be more than 9 if they wait.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid collisions, so might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nSince the grid is small, and cars move, we can compute for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen for each turn, when the player is on a freeway y, we need that for that y, at that turn, no car has 0 in span.\n\ny from 1 to 8.\n\nLet me denote t = T - t1, so relative time from current turn. t=0 is turn t1=60.\n\nAt time t (relative), the turn is t1 + t.\n\nPlayer position: start at y=0 at t=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nThe sequence of actions determines the path.\n\nTo reach y=9, the player must at some point be at each y from 0 to 9, but since they can move, they might not stay, but for collision, we care about the y at each turn when they are on freeway.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T, y_T is set, and if y_T between 1 and 8, then we need that for freeway k=y_T, at that turn, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway k, the set of times t (relative) when it is unsafe, i.e., some car on k has 0 in span at turn t1+t.\n\nFirst, for a given car, when is 0 in its span.\n\nGeneral: for a car with head h, tail τ, dir d, speed s at t1.\n\nAt time t relative, T = t1 + t, so T - t1 = t.\n\nFor right-moving car: Span(T) = [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\n0 in span if τ + s t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s t\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, from the data.\n\nIn freeway 5,6,7,8, there are cars, but all dir=right.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for any car: 0 in Span(T) iff τ + s t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s t\n\nWhich is equivalent to: -h/s ≤ t ≤ -τ/s ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nτ + s t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s t\n\nSince s >0, we can solve.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s t ≤ 0 ⇒ s t ≤ -τ ⇒ t ≤ -τ/s\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ h + s t ⇒ -h ≤ s t ⇒ t ≥ -h/s\n\nSo t ≥ -h/s and t ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince for right-moving, τ < h, so -h/s < -τ/s because h > τ, -h < -τ, divided by s>0.\n\nSo the interval is t ∈ [ ceil(-h/s) , floor(-τ/s) ]? But t must be integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt is integer, time in turns.\n\nSo the car has 0 in span at integer t where max( ceil(-h/s) , something) but let's think in terms of the inequalities.\n\nt must satisfy t ≥ ceil( -h/s ) and t ≤ floor( -τ/s )? Let's see.\n\nt ≥ ceil( -h/s ) because -h/s may not be integer.\n\nSimilarly, t ≤ floor( -τ/s ) because -τ/s may not be integer.\n\nDefine:\n\nLower bound: t_min = ceil( -h/s )\n\nUpper bound: t_max = floor( -τ/s )\n\nThen t from t_min to t_max inclusive, if t_min <= t_max.\n\n0 in span when τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t.\n\nSince t integer, we need to find min t such that h + s t >= 0, so t >= ceil(-h/s)\n\nAnd max t such that τ + s t <= 0, so t <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for each car on a freeway, we can find when it blocks y=0.\n\nThen for the freeway, it is unsafe if any car on it has 0 in span at that t.\n\nNow let's do for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: one car: h=48, τ=37, s=3\n\nt_min = ceil( -48/3 ) = ceil(-16) = -16\n\nt_max = floor( -37/3 ) = floor(-12.333) = -13? Let's compute:\n\n-48/3 = -16 exactly, so ceil(-16) = -16\n\n-37/3 = -12 - 1/3, so floor(-12.333) = -13? Floor of -12.333, since floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so -13 <= -12.333, and -12 > -12.333? -12 > -12.333, so floor(-12.333) = -13.\n\nFor example, floor(-1.2) = -2, because -2 < -1.2 < -1, and floor is -2.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-1.2) = -1.\n\nSo here, -τ/s = -37/3 = -12.333, floor = -13\n\nt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-48/3) = ceil(-16) = -16\n\nt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-37/3) = floor(-12.333) = -13\n\nSo t from -16 to -13 inclusive.\n\nBut t is relative to t1, and t=0 is current turn. So for t from -16 to -13, which is before current time, since t=0 is now.\n\nt relative, t=0 is turn t1=60, so t negative is before, positive after.\n\nAt t=0, which is now, for freeway 1, is it unsafe?\n\nt from -16 to -13, all negative, so at t>=0, no, t_min=-16, t_max=-13, so for t=0,1,2,... it is safe, since t=0 > t_max=-13.\n\nSimilarly, for future t, since t_max=-13, it will not block again? But cars keep moving, so the span moves right, and since it was at negative positions, moving right, it will be at positive positions later, but 0 might not be covered again.\n\nFor example, at t large, span is at large positive, so 0 not covered.\n\nThe unsafe times are only when the car passes through 0.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, the car was covering 0 at t=-16 to t=-13, which is before now, so at current and future, it is safe, no car blocks freeway 1.\n\nt_min=-16, t_max=-13, all before t=0, so for t>=0, freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\nt_min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil( -(-48)/6 ) = ceil(48/6) = ceil(8) =8\n\nt_max = floor(-τ/s) = floor( -(-59)/6 ) = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) =9\n\nCompute:\n\nh = -48, so -h = -(-48) =48? t >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil( -(-48)/6 ) = ceil(48/6) = ceil(8) =8\n\nτ = -59, -τ = -(-59) =59\n\nt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) =9\n\nSo t from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, freeway 2 is unsafe.\n\nt relative, so at turn t1+8 and t1+9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6), same as freeway 2.\n\nSo t_min = ceil(48/6) = ceil(8) =8\n\nt_max = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833)=9\n\nSo unsafe at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48,-59,right,6), unsafe at t=8,9\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=12\n\nt_min = ceil(-48/12) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nt_max = floor(-37/12) = floor(-37/12) = floor(-3.083) = -4? ceil(-4) = -4\n\n-37/12 = -3 -1/12 ≈ -3.083, floor(-3.083) = -4? Since -4 < -3.083 < -3, floor is -4.\n\nt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-37/12)\n\n-37/12 = -3.083, floor is -4.\n\nt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-48/12) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nt <= floor(-37/12) = floor(-3.083) = -4\n\nSo t from -4 to -4, only t=-4.\n\nSo unsafe only at t=-4, which is before now.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nt_min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-0/12) = ceil(0) =0\n\nt_max = floor(-τ/s) = floor( -(-11)/12 ) = floor(11/12) = floor(0.916) =0\n\nSo t >= ceil(0) =0\n\nt <= floor(11/12) = floor(0.916)=0\n\nSo only at t=0.\n\nt=0 is now, turn t1.\n\nSo for freeway 5, first car unsafe at t=-4 (past), second car unsafe at t=0.\n\nSo at t=0, the second car has 0 in span, so freeway 5 is unsafe at t=0.\n\nNow, for other times? Only at these points.\n\nFor example, at t=1, h + s t = 0 + 12*1 =12, τ + s t = -11 +12=1, so span [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, t=-1, h + s t =0 +12*(-1)= -12, τ + s t = -11 -12= -23, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=0 for second car.\n\nThus freeway 5 unsafe only at t=0.\n\nBut t=0 is now.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSame as freeway 5, so unsafe only at t=0 for the second car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, unsafe at t=0.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nt_min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(48/12) = ceil(4) =4\n\nt_max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(59/12) = floor(4.916) =4\n\nSo t >=4 and t<=4, so only t=4.\n\nSecond car: same as before, (0,-11,right,12), unsafe at t=0.\n\nSo for freeway 8, unsafe at t=0 (from second car) and at t=4 (from first car).\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the unsafe times (relative t):\n\nFreeway 1: safe at all t>=0\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at t=0\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at t=0\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at t=0\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=0 and t=4\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nAt each turn, after action, y is set, and if y between 1 and 8, we need that at that turn, the freeway is safe.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, always safe.\n\nThe sequence: let me denote the turn relative t, and y_t.\n\nAt t=0, y=0 (initial position, before any action? Let's see the timing.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1, so at turn t1, y_{t1} =0.\n\nThen actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1? The sequence is from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nTurn indexing: at turn T, the player has position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, determining y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we care about y_T and the cars at T.\n\nIn the task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nNow, at turn t1, position is (0,0), so y_{t1} =0.\n\nAction a_{t1} is taken at turn t1, which sets y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, a_{t1+1} sets y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to a_{t1+H-1} sets y_{t1+H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nSuppose at turn t1, y_{t1} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1+k}, at turn t1+k+1, y_{t1+k+1} is set.\n\nWe want at some turn, y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1.\n\nT = t1 + H -1, so y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe last action is a_{t1 + H -1}, which is taken at turn t1 + H -1, and sets y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + H -1} + Δy_{t1 + H -1}\n\nBut we don't care about y_{t1+H}, we care that at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo when y_{t1 + H -1} =9, it means that at turn t1 + H -1, the player is at (0,9), which is the goal, and no need to act further.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 relative, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, y might be different, but we stop when y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions: one action a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1+1}. But we want y_{t1} =9? No, at t1, y=0, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince at t1, y=0, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so H-1 >=9? Let's think.\n\nEach action changes y, but we have multiple turns.\n\nAt turn t1, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy = 0 + Δy\n\nAfter second action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1+k, y_{t1+k} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which affect y from t1+1 to t1+H.\n\nBut the position at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{t1 + H -1}, which is determined by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, I think.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nAt T=t1, y_T =0.\n\nAction at T: a_T, sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at T+1, y_{T+1} is position, and so on.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, which are the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t1} =9, but y_{t1}=0, not possible, so H must be at least 1, but y_{t1} =0, to reach y=9, need to increase y.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 with only U actions would be: start at t1, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{t1}=U, at t1+1, y=1\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}=U, at t1+2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+8}=U, at t1+9, y=9\n\nSo at turn t1+9, y=9, so T = t1+9 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 = t1+9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, that's 10 actions.\n\nWith actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+8} all U, then at turn t1+9, y=9, so T=t1+9 = t1+H-1, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nIf we can go faster, but since each U increases y by 1, we need at least 9 U actions to go from 0 to 9, and possibly some S or D, which would require more turns, so minimal H is at least 10, with 9 U and possibly one S or something, but with only U, H=10.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 9 U actions, we reach y=9 at turn t1+9.\n\nNow, in this case, we need to avoid collisions when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the direct path, we would be at:\n\nAt turn t1, y=0, safe\n\na_{t1}=U, then at turn t1+1, y=1\n\nAt turn t1+1, y=1, which is freeway, need safe at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, at t1+2, y=2, and so on, up to t1+8, y=8, then at t1+9, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, for each turn, we need the freeway safe at that time.\n\nNow, relative t: let t = T - t1, so at turn T, relative time t.\n\nAt turn t1, t=0, y=0\n\nTurn t1+1, t=1, y=1\n\nTurn t1+2, t=2, y=2\n\n...\n\nTurn t1+8, t=8, y=8\n\nTurn t1+9, t=9, y=9\n\nNow, for each of these, when on freeway y=k at turn t, need that freeway k is safe at time t.\n\nSo for y=1 at t=1: freeway 1 at t=1\n\nFrom above, freeway 1 is safe at all t>=0, so ok.\n\ny=2 at t=2: freeway 2 at t=2\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at t=8,9, not at t=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=3: freeway 3 at t=3, unsafe at t=8,9, not 3, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=4: freeway 4 at t=4, unsafe at t=8,9, not 4, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=5: freeway 5 at t=5\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe only at t=0, not t=5, so safe.\n\ny=6 at t=6: freeway 6 at t=6, unsafe only at t=0, not 6, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=7: freeway 7 at t=7, unsafe only at t=0, not 7, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=8: freeway 8 at t=8\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=0 and t=4.\n\nt=8 is not 0 or 4, so should be safe? t=8, not unsafe time, so safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=9, goal.\n\nIn this path, all freeways are safe at the times we are on them.\n\nFor freeway 8 at t=8: unsafe at t=0 and t=4, t=8 is fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=1, y=1; t=2,y=2; ... t=8,y=8; all seem safe.\n\nIs there any problem?\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 are unsafe at t=0, but at t=0 we are at y=0, not on them.\n\nAt t=5, freeway 5 is safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, freeway 8 is safe.\n\nSo it seems we can go directly up with 9 U moves in 9 steps? But H=10 turns.\n\nActions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+8} all U, then at turn t1+9, y=9, which is the goal turn.\n\nNumber of actions: 9 actions, from t1 to t1+8, that's 9 actions, H=9? Let's clarify.\n\nActions: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} set, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence: actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nFor example, with H=9: actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+8}\n\nAfter a_{t1}, at t1+1, y= y_{t1} + Δy =0 +1=1 (if U)\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, at t1+2, y=1+1=2, ...\n\nAfter a_{t1+7}, at t1+8, y=8? Let's see:\n\nAt turn t1, y=0\n\na_{t1} = U, sets y_{t1+1} =1\n\na_{t1+1} = U, sets y_{t1+2} =2\n\n...\n\na_{t1+k} = U, sets y_{t1+k+1} = k+1\n\nAfter a_{t1+7} = U, sets y_{t1+8} = 8? When we set a_{t1+7}, it sets y_{t1+8}.\n\nThen we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=9, t1 + H -1 = t1 +8, so we want y_{t1+8} =9.\n\nBut with above, after a_{t1+7}, y_{t1+8} =8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1+8} =9, we need to be at y=8 at turn t1+7, then a_{t1+7}=U to set y_{t1+8}=9.\n\nAt turn t1+7, y=?\n\nStart: turn t1, y=0\n\nAfter a_{t1}=U, turn t1+1, y=1\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}=U, turn t1+2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+6}=U, turn t1+7, y=7\n\nThen a_{t1+7}=U, sets y_{t1+8}=8\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t1+8, we need to start from lower.\n\ny_{t1} =0\n\nAfter first U, y_{t1+1}=1\n\nAfter second U, y_{t1+2}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th U, y_{t1+k}=k\n\nSet y_{t1+k}=9, so k=9, y_{t1+9}=9\n\nThen T = t1+9 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, all U except we might not need all, but to reach in min turns, we need all U.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1+8} all U: 9 actions.\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1}=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+8}, y_{t1+9}=9\n\nThen at turn t1+9, y=9, so T=t1+9 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, but a_{t1+9} sets y_{t1+10}, which is not used.\n\nWe need only up to a_{t1+8} to set y_{t1+9}=9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=10, t1 + H -1 = t1+9, y_{t1+9}=9.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, but a_{t1+9} is the 10th action, which sets y_{t1+10}, but we don't care.\n\nTo have y_{t1+9}=9, we need the actions before.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1, y=0\n\na_{t1} sets y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\na_{t1+8} sets y_{t1+9}\n\nSo to have y_{t1+9}=9, we need a_{t1} to a_{t1+8} to be such that after 9 actions, y=9.\n\nSince each U increases by 1, we need exactly 9 U actions in the first 9 actions? But we have actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor y_{t1+9} to be 9, it must be that from y_{t1}=0, after 9 steps (actions at t1 to t1+8), we reach y=9.\n\nSo net +9, so we need exactly 9 U and 0 S or D, so all actions must be U from a_{t1} to a_{t1+8}.\n\nThen a_{t1+8} = U, sets y_{t1+9} = previous y +1, and if previous y at turn t1+8 was 8, then y_{t1+9}=9.\n\nBut at turn t1+8, y_{t1+8} must be 8 to set to 9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t1, y=0\n\na_{t1}=U: sets y_{t1+1}=1\n\nAt turn t1+1, y=1\n\na_{t1+1}=U: sets y_{t1+2}=2\n\n...\n\nAt turn t1+8, y=8 (set by a_{t1+7}?)\n\nAt turn t1+7, y=7 (set by a_{t1+6})\n\na_{t1+7}=U: sets y_{t1+8}=8\n\nAt turn t1+8, y=8\n\na_{t1+8}=U: sets y_{t1+9}=9\n\nAt turn t1+9, y=9\n\nNow, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1+9, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, but a_{t1+9} is not used to set y_{t1+9}, but we have to specify actions up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nFor H=10, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, but a_{t1+9} sets y_{t1+10}, which is beyond the goal.\n\nBut since we reach y=9 at turn t1+9, we can set a_{t1+9} to S or something, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, we need only to specify actions until we reach, but the actions include a_{t1+H-1}, and y_{t1+H-1} must be 9.\n\nIn this case, with all U from a_{t1} to a_{t1+8}, we have y_{t1+9}=9 at turn t1+9.\n\nSo for turn t1+9, y=9, so if we set H such that t1+H-1 = t1+9, so H=10.\n\nThen actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}.\n\nBut a_{t1+9} is the 10th action, which we can set to S, for example, since y is already 9.\n\nBut in terms of collision, at turn t1+9, y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, back to the path: we need to be at y=1 at t=1 (relative), y=2 at t=2, ..., y=8 at t=8.\n\nNow, for each:\n\nAt t=1, y=1, freeway 1: safe, as we said.\n\nt=2, y=2, freeway 2: unsafe at t=8,9, but t=2, safe.\n\nt=3, y=3, freeway 3: unsafe at t=8,9, t=3 safe.\n\nt=4, y=4, freeway 4: unsafe at t=8,9, t=4 safe.\n\nt=5, y=5, freeway 5: unsafe only at t=0, t=5 safe.\n\nt=6, y=6, freeway 6: unsafe at t=0, t=6 safe.\n\nt=7, y=7, freeway 7: unsafe at t=0, t=7 safe.\n\nt=8, y=8, freeway 8: unsafe at t=0 and t=4, t=8 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at t=8, we are at y=8, and freeway 8 is safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=9, goal.\n\nIn this, at t=8, relative, which is turn t1+8, we are on freeway 8, and it is safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 are unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but at t=8, we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo the direct path seems collision-free.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 8 at t=4? At t=4, if we were on y=4, but in this path, at t=4, we are on y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 is unsafe at t=8,9, not at t=4, so safe.\n\nFreeway 8 is unsafe at t=4, but at t=4, we are on y=4, not y=8, so no collision.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, we can go directly up with U each turn.\n\nBut H=10, actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, but a_{t1} to a_{t1+8} should be U, and a_{t1+9} can be S, since we are already at y=9 at turn t1+9.\n\ny_{t1+9}=9 at turn t1+9.\n\nAction a_{t1+9} is taken at turn t1+9, but since y is already 9, we can set it to S, or it doesn't matter.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=10, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+9}.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1+8} all U, and a_{t1+9} = S, for example.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 5,6,7, unsafe at t=0, but at t=0, we are at y=0, not on them.\n\nIn the path, we are on them at t=5,6,7, which are safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 unsafe at t=4, but at t=4, we are on y=4, not y=8.\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=8, and freeway 8 safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, if we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4, so ok.\n\nAt t=9, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with actions: U from t1 to t1+8, and S at t1+9.\n\nBut a_{t1+9} can be anything, but S is fine.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t1+8: a_{t1+8} = U\n\nTurn t1+9: a_{t1+9} = S  (or U, but y=9, cannot go up, but y max 9, so if U, y stays 9? According to the dynamics, y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, but y in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t +1) =9, similarly for D.\n\nBut in this case, since we are at goal, S is fine.\n\nBut let's see the action: if y=9 and U, y stays 9, no problem.\n\nBut to be safe, S.\n\nBut in terms of minimal turns, H=10 is achievable.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H must be at least 10, since from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 increases, so at least 9 actions that are U, and with possible S or D, but S or D don't help to go up, so minimal actions is 9, but with 9 actions, we reach y=9 at turn t1+9, which requires H=10 as above.\n\nWith 9 actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+8}, all U, then at turn t1+9, y=9, so if we set H such that t1+H-1 = t1+9, H=10.\n\nIf we could reach earlier, but no, because at t1, y=0, after one action, y=1 at t1+1, etc., up to at least t1+9 for y=9.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal possible.\n\nAnd we can achieve it with no delays.\n\nBut in the car states, at t=0, freeway 5,6,7 are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nIn the sequence, when do we first be on freeway?\n\nAt turn t1+1, y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 8 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4 relative, turn t1+4, if we were on y=8, but in the path, at t=4, we are on y=4, not y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=4, but we are not there.\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=8, and freeway 8 safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 unsafe at t=4, but t=4 is when we are on y=4.\n\nNow, for freeway 2,3,4 at t=8: unsafe, but at t=8, we are on y=8, not y=2,3,4.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is straightforward.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nSo for turn t1=60:\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 68: U (that's 9 U's)\n\nThen turn 69: S, but we need to reach at turn t1+H-1=69 with y=9.\n\nH=10, so actions from turn 60 to 69.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1+9}, turn 60 to 69.\n\na_{60} to a_{68} U, a_{69} S.\n\nBut at turn 69, after a_{69}, y_{70} is set, but we don't care, and at turn 69, y=9 if we set a_{68} U from y=8 to y=9 at turn 69.\n\nIn terms of the turn when y=9: at turn 69, y=9.\n\nAction at turn 69 is not necessary for reaching, but we have to specify it.\n\nIn the sequence, we can set a_{69} to S.\n\nSince the player is at y=9, any action is fine, but S is neutral.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's write relative to t1.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: U\n\nTurn t1+2: U\n\nTurn t1+3: U\n\nTurn t1+4: U\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: U\n\nTurn t1+7: U\n\nTurn t1+8: U\n\nTurn t1+9: S\n\nBut for turn t1+9, action S, but at that turn, y=9, and we take action S, which keeps y=9 for next, but since we reached, it's fine.\n\nTo have exactly H actions until we reach.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait or go down? In this case, no, since all is safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the cars again.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 at t=0 unsafe, but we not there.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12) at t1, so at t=0, head=0, tail=-11, so span at t=0: [ -11 +12*0, 0 +12*0] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nBut at t=1, span [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, at t=0, the second car has span [ -11,0], unsafe.\n\nAt t=4, the first car: for freeway 8, car (-48,-59,right,12), at t=4, τ + s t = -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11? h + s t = -48 +48=0, so span [ -11, 0], so 0 included, unsafe.\n\nBut at t=4, we are not on freeway 8.\n\nIn the path, at t=4, we are on y=4.\n\nNow, for freeway 2,3,4 at t=8: let's see.\n\nFreeway 2: car (-48,-59,right,6), at t=8, τ + s t = -59 +6*8 = -59+48= -11, h + s t = -48 +48=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut at t=8, we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with all U except last S.\n\nBut we can set last to U, but y stays 9.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to write for each turn.\n\nBut t1=60, so turns 60 to 69.\n\nBut in the box, with t1.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  \nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}  \n...  \n}\n\nSo for H=10, up to Turn t_1 + 9: a_{t_1 + 9}\n\nActions: for t=0 to 8: U, t=9: S\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: U  \nTurn t_1 + 1: U  \nTurn t_1 + 2: U  \nTurn t_1 + 3: U  \nTurn t_1 + 4: U  \nTurn t_1 + 5: U  \nTurn t_1 + 6: U  \nTurn t_1 + 7: U  \nTurn t_1 + 8: U  \nTurn t_1 + 9: S\n\nBut is S necessary? We can set it to U, but since y=9, it stays, or S, same.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the last action, it doesn't affect reaching.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps we can have H smaller, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: the player can go down to avoid, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nFor example, if at some point unsafe, we might stay or go down, but here no need.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut let's see if at t=0, we are at y=0, but if we do S at first, y stays 0, but then we need to go up later, H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=10.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn when we reach.\n\nAt turn t1+9, y=9.\n\nWith actions above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by starting immediately.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother point: in freeway 5,6,7, at t=0 unsafe, but since we start at y=0, not on freeway, and we move at t=0 action to y=1 at next turn.\n\nSo fine.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo the sequence is 9 U and one S.\n\nBut in the actions, 10 actions.\n\nNow for the box.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal path from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires exactly 9 upward moves (U actions), as each U increases \\(y\\) by 1. With no delays, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 9\\).\n- \\(H\\) is defined such that \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\). To achieve \\(y_{t_1 + 9} = 9\\), \\(t_1 + H - 1 = t_1 + 9\\) implies \\(H = 10\\). Thus, 10 actions are needed: \\(a_{t_1}\\) to \\(a_{t_1 + 9}\\).\n- Actions \\(a_{t_1}\\) to \\(a_{t_1 + 8}\\) must all be U to increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9. Action \\(a_{t_1 + 9}\\) can be S (stay) since \\(y = 9\\) is already reached and further movement is unnecessary.\n- Collisions are avoided because:\n  - At each turn when the player is on a freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), the freeway is safe (no car has 0 in its span at that turn).\n  - Specifically:\n    - At \\(t = 1\\) (relative), \\(y = 1\\): Freeway 1 is safe at all \\(t \\geq 0\\).\n    - At \\(t = 2\\), \\(y = 2\\): Freeway 2 is unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\), not at \\(t = 2\\).\n    - At \\(t = 3\\), \\(y = 3\\): Freeway 3 is unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\), not at \\(t = 3\\).\n    - At \\(t = 4\\), \\(y = 4\\): Freeway 4 is unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\), not at \\(t = 4\\).\n    - At \\(t = 5\\), \\(y = 5\\): Freeway 5 is unsafe only at \\(t = 0\\), not at \\(t = 5\\).\n    - At \\(t = 6\\), \\(y = 6\\): Freeway 6 is unsafe only at \\(t = 0\\), not at \\(t = 6\\).\n    - At \\(t = 7\\), \\(y = 7\\): Freeway 7 is unsafe only at \\(t = 0\\), not at \\(t = 7\\).\n    - At \\(t = 8\\), \\(y = 8\\): Freeway 8 is unsafe at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 4\\), not at \\(t = 8\\).\n  - At \\(t = 0\\) (start), \\(y = 0\\) (no freeway, safe).\n  - At \\(t = 9\\), \\(y = 9\\) (goal, no freeway, safe).\n\nThus, the direct upward path with all U actions for the first 9 turns and S at the last turn achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 9\\) with \\(H = 10\\), and no collisions occur.\n\n### Minimal Sequence of Actions (for \\(H = 10\\)):\n- Turn \\(t_1\\): U (sets \\(y_{61} = 1\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): U (sets \\(y_{62} = 2\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 2\\): U (sets \\(y_{63} = 3\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 3\\): U (sets \\(y_{64} = 4\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 4\\): U (sets \\(y_{65} = 5\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 5\\): U (sets \\(y_{66} = 6\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 6\\): U (sets \\(y_{67} = 7\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 7\\): U (sets \\(y_{68} = 8\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 8\\): U (sets \\(y_{69} = 9\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 9\\): S (maintains \\(y_{70} = 9\\), but not needed as goal is reached at turn 69)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 6: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 7: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 8: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 9: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t₁ = 66. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it only matters if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and if at that turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span. The span moves with the car's speed and direction.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you are on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nIn the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, you are at position (0, y_t). Then you choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}. So at turn t, you are on freeway y_t, and you might collide if 0 is in the span of a car on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThe collision definition says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check if there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nIf the player moves to a different y, say from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T, they are on y_T = y, so they check freeway y at time T. Then at turn T+1, they are on y_{T+1} = y+1, so they check freeway y+1 at time T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which matches what I said.\n\nNow, for the cars, each freeway has one or more cars, with their positions given at t₁=66.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 66 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, list all the cars and their spans at time t.\n\nt₁ = 66.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car, head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, span is [τ, h] = [37, 48] at t=66.\n\nThe notation: for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] at time T.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3) → head=48, tail=37, so since right, span [37,48] at t=66.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) → tail=-59, head=-48? No.\n\nThe notation: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" and for left, \"[h, τ]\".\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3) so h=48, τ=37, d=right, so at t₁, span is [τ, h] = [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) so h=-48, τ=-59? That can't be right because if τ is tail and h is head, for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if moving right.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 2: head = -48, tail = -59. Since direction is right, and -48 > -59, so head is at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, and since moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-59 + 6(T-66), -48 + 6(T-66)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 3 same as 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4 same: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12, span at t₁: [37,48]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12, span at t₁: [-11,0]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t=66.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, also no cars.\n\nSo when at y=0 or y=9, safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to go up through y=1 to 8.\n\nBut cars are moving, so I need to avoid times when on a freeway y, 0 is occupied by a car on that freeway at that time.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, and spans are given, I need to find for each freeway, when is 0 occupied.\n\nCollision if 0 is in the span at time T for the car on that freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time T, the span of the car(s) on k, and if 0 is in any of their spans.\n\nFor freeways with multiple cars, I need to check all.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions.\n\nSet τ = T - t₁ = T - 66, the time offset.\n\nSo for any time T, let t = T - 66, so t=0 at current turn.\n\nThen for freeway 1: one car, span at time T: since right-moving, [37 + 3t, 48 + 3t] because τ + s t, h + s t with s=3, τ=37, h=48.\n\nAt T, span = [37 + 3(T-66), 48 + 3(T-66)] = [37 + 3t, 48 + 3t] where t = T-66.\n\n0 is in span if 37 + 3t <= 0 <= 48 + 3t.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: one car, h=-48, τ=-59, s=6, right, span at T: [ -59 + 6t, -48 + 6t ]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 6t <= 0 <= -48 + 6t\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, since same car? No, different freeway, but same parameters, so same span: [ -59 + 6t, -48 + 6t ]\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=12, right, span: [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, s=12, right, span: [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t] = [-11 + 12t, 12t]\n\n0 in first car: 37 + 12t <= 0 <= 48 + 12t\n\n0 in second car: -11 + 12t <= 0 <= 12t\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 and 7, same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: first car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12, right, span: [-59 + 12t, -48 + 12t]\n\nSecond car: same as above, [-11 + 12t, 12t]\n\nNow, the player needs to be on freeway k at some turn, and avoid 0 being in any car span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince freeways 2,3,4 are identical, and 5,6,7 identical, I can group them.\n\nBut the player moves vertically, so I need to consider the sequence of y positions.\n\ny starts at 0 at t=0 (turn 66).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, I need at least 9 moves up, but I can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid collisions, so I might need to wait or move down sometimes.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I might stay there to avoid bad times.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should go up when possible.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is occupied by a car on k.\n\nDefine for each k, the set of t where collision occurs on k.\n\nt is time offset from t₁=66, so t=0,1,2,... for turns 66,67,68,...\n\nSince the cars are moving, the spans change linearly.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1:\n\nCar span: [37 + 3t, 48 + 3t]\n\n0 in [37+3t, 48+3t] iff 37+3t <= 0 <= 48+3t\n\nSince 37+3t <=0 and 0<=48+3t.\n\n37+3t <=0 => 3t <= -37 => t <= -37/3 ≈ -12.333, but t >=0, so 37+3t >0 for t>=0, so 37+3t <=0 is impossible for t>=0. Similarly, 0<=48+3t is always true for t>=0 since 48+3t >=48>0.\n\nSo 0 in span only if both inequalities, but 37+3t <=0 false, so for all t>=0, 0 not in [37+3t,48+3t] because the left end is at least 37>0, so 0 is left of the span.\n\n[37+3t,48+3t], for t=0, [37,48], all positive, so 0 not in it. As t increases, it moves right, so always positive, never covers 0. So freeway 1 is always safe for t>=0.\n\nIs that right? t=0, [37,48], min x=37>0, so 0 not in [37,48]. At t=1, [40,51], still >0, etc. Yes, since min x=37+3t >=37>0, so 0 never in span. So freeway 1 is safe at all times t>=0.\n\nGreat.\n\nFreeway k=2:\n\nCar span: [-59 + 6t, -48 + 6t]\n\n0 in span iff -59 + 6t <= 0 <= -48 + 6t\n\nWhich is -59 + 6t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 6t\n\nFirst: -59 + 6t <= 0 => 6t <= 59 => t <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6t => 6t >= 48 => t >= 8\n\nSo t >=8 and t <=9.833, since t integer, t=9 or t=10? t<=9.833, so t=9 and t=10?\n\nt >=8 and t<=9.833, t integer, so t=9.\n\nt=8: check inequalities.\n\nAt t=8: -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true.\n\n0 <= -48 + 48 =0, 0<=0 true, so yes, 0 in span at t=8.\n\nt=9: -59 + 54 = -5 <=0 true, 0 <= -48 + 54 =6, 0<=6 true, so yes.\n\nt=10: -59 +60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nLower bound: -59+6t <=0 for t<=9.833, so t<=9 since t int? t<= floor(59/6)=9 since 6*9=54<59? 59/6=9.833, so -59+6t <=0 when t<=9.833, so for t=0 to 9, -59+6t <=0? At t=9, -59+54=-5<=0 true, t=10,1>0 false.\n\nUpper bound: 0 <= -48+6t when t>=8, since -48+48=0 at t=8.\n\nAt t=7: -48+42=-6<0, so 0 <= -6 false.\n\nSo 0 <= -48+6t only when t>=8.\n\nThus, for t=8 and t=9, both conditions true.\n\nt=8: -59+48=-11 <=0, and 0 <= -48+48=0, so 0 in [-11,0]? Span is [-59+6t, -48+6t], at t=8, [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since <=0 and >= -11, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly t=9: [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=10: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=3: same as k=2, so unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway k=4: same, unsafe t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway k=5:\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: span [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n0 in [37+12t,48+12t] iff 37+12t <=0 <=48+12t\n\n37+12t <=0 => 12t <= -37 => t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, impossible for t>=0.\n\n0<=48+12t always true.\n\nBut left inequality false, so never for first car.\n\nSecond car: span [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t] = [-11+12t, 12t]\n\n0 in span iff -11+12t <= 0 <= 12t\n\nWhich is -11+12t <=0 and 0<=12t\n\n0<=12t always true for t>=0.\n\n-11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so for t=0 only? t<=0.916, t integer >=0, so t=0.\n\nAt t=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, and 0<=0 true, so 0 in [-11,0] at t=0.\n\nt=1: -11+12=1, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=0, second car has 0 in span.\n\nThus for freeway 5, unsafe only at t=0 due to second car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, unsafe at t=0.\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe at t=0.\n\nNow freeway k=8:\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: span [-59 + 12t, -48 + 12t]\n\n0 in span iff -59+12t <=0 <= -48+12t\n\nWhich is -59+12t <=0 and 0<= -48+12t\n\nFirst: -59+12t <=0 => 12t <=59 => t <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so t<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12t => 12t >=48 => t>=4\n\nSo t>=4 and t<=4.916, so t=4.\n\nAt t=4: -59+48= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -48+48=0 true, so 0 in [-11,0]? Span at t=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], yes 0 in it.\n\nt=5: -59+60=1, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: same as before, span [-11+12t, 12t], unsafe only at t=0 as above.\n\nAt t=0, second car unsafe.\n\nBut for freeway 8, at t=0, second car makes it unsafe.\n\nAlso at t=4, first car makes it unsafe.\n\nSo unsafe at t=0 and t=4.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the unsafe times:\n\nk=1: always safe\n\nk=2: unsafe t=8,9\n\nk=3: unsafe t=8,9\n\nk=4: unsafe t=8,9\n\nk=5: unsafe t=0\n\nk=6: unsafe t=0\n\nk=7: unsafe t=0\n\nk=8: unsafe t=0 and t=4\n\nt is time offset from t₁=66, so turn number T = t + 66.\n\nBut for planning, we use t.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, position (0,0), which is safe since no freeway.\n\nThen at each turn, player chooses action, which determines y for next turn.\n\nAt turn T, after choosing action, we move to y_{T+1}, but the collision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nThen player chooses action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nDuring turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and we check if collision occurs, meaning if for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car span at time T.\n\nIf not, safe, else collision.\n\nThen we proceed to turn T+1 with new position y_{T+1}.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9, so at turn t₁ + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nt₁=66, so at turn 66 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=66 to t=66 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 in offset, meaning a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H - 1}.\n\nIn the answer format: {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t₁ to t₁ + H - 1.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, the position is after H steps.\n\nBut the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nStart at turn t₁=66, y_{66} = 0.\n\nAfter first action a_{66}, y_{67} = y_{66} + Δy_{66}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{66 + k}, y_{66 + k + 1} = y_{66 + k} + Δy_{66 + k}\n\nWe want y_{66 + H - 1} = 9? No.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBecause y_{t₁} to y_{t₁ + H} after H steps.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), which is position at some turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the task: \"minimizes H such that y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t₁ + t.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, we have positions from y_{t₁} to y_{t₁ + H}.\n\ny_{t₁} is initial, before any action.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁} at time t₁, we get y_{t₁ + 1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁ + 1} at time t₁+1, we get y_{t₁ + 2}, and so on, up to after action a_{t₁ + H - 1} at time t₁ + H - 1, we get y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9? That seems inconsistent.\n\ny_{t₁ + H - 1} is the position at turn t₁ + H - 1, before action a_{t₁ + H - 1} is taken.\n\nAfter taking a_{t₁ + H - 1}, we get y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we want the position to be (0,9) at some turn, specifically y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSo at turn t₁ + H - 1, player is at (0,9), which is safe, and we don't care about after.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H - 1}, and after taking these, we have y_{t₁ + H}, but we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9, so the last action a_{t₁ + H - 1} should move to y=9 at turn t₁ + H.\n\nLet's clarify the indices.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nAt T = t₁ = 66, position y_T = 0.\n\nChoose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at T+1, position y_{T+1}, choose a_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want that at some turn S, y_S = 9.\n\nAnd S = t₁ + H - 1 for some H.\n\nSince we start at T=66 with y=0, and we want y_S = 9 for S = t₁ + H - 1.\n\nThe actions are from T=66 to T=66 + H - 2? Let's see the number of actions.\n\nFrom T=66 to S, we need to go from y=0 to y=9, which takes at least 9 up moves, but with possible downs or stays, so the number of turns from 66 to S is S - 66.\n\nS = t₁ + H - 1 = 66 + H - 1.\n\nSo the number of turns from start to reach is (S - 66) + 1? From turn 66 to turn S inclusive, but positions at each turn.\n\nAt turn 66: y=0\n\nAfter some turns, at turn S: y=9.\n\nThe actions taken are from turn 66 to turn S-1, because at turn K, we choose action to go to y_{K+1}.\n\nSo to reach y_S at turn S, we take actions from 66 to S-1.\n\nThe number of actions is (S-1) - 66 + 1 = S - 66.\n\nThen S = t₁ + H - 1 = 66 + H - 1.\n\nSo number of actions = (66 + H - 1) - 66 = H - 1.\n\nBut in the sequence, it says {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which has H actions: t=0 to H-1, so for times t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, we have y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSo for y_{t₁ + H - 1} to be 9, it must be that the action at t₁ + H - 2 or something.\n\nI think there's confusion in the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"the sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1} at time t_1, we get y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1 +1} at time t_1+1, we get y_{t_1 +2}, ..., after taking action a_{t_1 + H -1} at time t_1 + H -1, we get y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before the action a_{t_1 + H -1} is taken.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, it means that at turn t_1 + H -1, the player is already at (0,9) before taking any action that turn. But at that turn, we still take an action, but since we are at 9, we might stay or something, but the position is already 9.\n\nIn terms of reaching, if y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, we have reached at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe action at that turn might change it, but since we want the position to be 9 at that turn, it is achieved before the action.\n\nThe actions from t=0 to H-1 correspond to times t_1 to t_1+H-1, and they affect the positions from y_{t_1+1} to y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, which is position at time t_1 + H -1.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, it depends on the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions {a_{t_1}}, so one action at t_1, which determines y_{t_1+1}, but we want y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, but at t_1, y=0, not 9, so impossible. So H must be at least such that we can reach from 0 to 9.\n\nMin H to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9, with all up moves.\n\nWith H actions, we can reach up to y_H.\n\nLet the position at turn T be y_T.\n\nAt T= t_1, y_T =0.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_S =9 for S = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe number of actions to reach from turn t_1 to turn S is S - t_1 actions, from turn t_1 to S-1.\n\nFor example, to go from turn 66 to turn 66, no action, y=0.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 66, impossible.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 67, we need one action at turn 66 to set y_67=9.\n\nBut from y_66=0, to y_67=9, we need Δy = +9, but Δy only +1,0,-1, so impossible in one step.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at turn 66+H-1, we need to have moved from y=0 at turn 66 to y=9 at turn 66+H-1 in (66+H-1) - 66 = H-1 turns, so with H-1 actions.\n\nThe actions are from turn 66 to turn 66+H-2, determining y_67 to y_{66+H-1}.\n\nThen at turn 66+H-1, y=9.\n\nAnd the sequence of actions has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, times t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=10, actions at t=66 to 75, determining y_67 to y_76.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{66+10-1} = y_{75} =9.\n\nSo y_75=9, which is set by action at turn 74, a_{74}, with y_75 = y_74 + Δy_74.\n\nThe actions include a_{75}, which would determine y_76, but we don't care, since we already reached at turn 75.\n\nIn the sequence, we have H actions, but the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} is at turn t_1 + H -1, which determines y_{t_1 + H}, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so for that position, it is not affected by a_{t_1 + H -1}; instead, it is affected by previous actions.\n\nSo in the sequence, the action at t_1 + H -1 is taken, but it doesn't affect the position at that turn; it affects the next.\n\nBut since we only care about reaching at turn t_1 + H -1, the action at that turn can be anything, but we must specify it.\n\nIn terms of collision, at each turn T, when we are at y_T, we check collision based on that.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, if y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it is safe, no issue.\n\nThe action a_{t_1 + H -1} might move us away, but since we reached, it's fine.\n\nFor planning, we need to ensure that at each turn from 66 to t_1 + H -2, when we are at some y, it is safe for that freeway at that time.\n\nLet's list the turns where we are on freeway.\n\nStart at turn 66: y=0, safe, not on freeway.\n\nThen we choose action a_66, which determines y_67.\n\nAt turn 67, we are at y_67, which could be 0,1, or if we went up, 1, etc.\n\nThen at turn 67, we are on freeway if y_67 between 1 and 8, and we check collision for that freeway at time 67.\n\nThen choose a_67, and so on.\n\nUp to turn S = t_1 + H -1, where y_S =9, safe.\n\nThe actions are from turn 66 to turn S-1, number of actions is S - 66.\n\nS = t_1 + H -1 = 66 + H -1.\n\nSo number of actions = (66 + H -1) - 66 = H -1.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions, so for H actions, we have positions from y_{t_1+1} to y_{t_1+H}, and we want one of them to be 9 at the turn index.\n\nBut specifically, we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, with H actions, we can have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can achieve this.\n\nSince we start at y=0, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so H must be at least 9, with all up, but may have stays or downs, so H >=9.\n\nWith H=9, all up, we go from y=0 at t=66 to y=9 at t=75, since each up move increases y by 1 each turn.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt t=66, y=0.\n\nAfter a66=U, y67=1\n\na67=U, y68=2\n\n...\n\na74=U, y75=9\n\nThen at turn 75, y=9, which is S= t1 + H -1 =66 +9 -1=74? t1=66, H=9, S=66+9-1=74, but y75=9, turn 75.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nt1=66, S= t1 + H -1 =66 + H -1\n\ny_S =9\n\nFor S=75, then 66 + H -1 =75, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen y_{75} =9 at turn 75.\n\nWith actions from t=66 to t=74 (9 actions), we set y67 to y75.\n\ny67=1, y68=2, ..., y75=9.\n\nThen S=75, H=10, since S= t1 + H -1=66+10-1=75.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=9, so times 66 to 74.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we can reach faster with downs, but since we need to go up, downs would make it slower, so minimal H is at least 9, but with H=9 actions, we can go to y9, but from y0 to y9 in 9 steps, position at turn 75 with y=9.\n\nBut with H=9 actions, times 66 to 74, positions y67 to y75, so y75=9.\n\nS=75, t1 + H -1=66+9-1=74? 66+9-1=74, but we want y74=9? No.\n\nt1 + H -1 for H=9 is 74, but y74 is set by action at 73, so with 9 actions, y75=9, so S=75.\n\nBut t1 + H -1 =66+9-1=74, which is not 75.\n\nSo to have y_S=9 for S=75, we need t1 + H -1 =75, so 66 + H -1 =75, thus H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 9, times 66 to 75.\n\nBut at turn 75, we take action a75, which determines y76, but we don't care.\n\nAt turn 75, position y75=9, safe.\n\nThe actions include a75, but since we reached at turn 75, it's fine.\n\nIn terms of collision, for turns 66 to 74, we are at some y and need to be safe.\n\nFor turn 75, y=9, safe.\n\nNow back to the problem.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 66, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at t=8,9 (t=0 at turn 66)\n\nt=8: turn 74, t=9: turn 75\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same, unsafe turn 74 and 75\n\nFreeway 4: same, turn 74,75\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at t=0, turn 66\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe turn 66\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe turn 66\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=0 and t=4, turn 66 and turn 70 (since t=4, T=66+4=70)\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nWith all up moves, we can reach in 9 steps: actions U from turn 66 to 74, then at turn 75, y=9.\n\nH=10, since actions from 66 to 75, but at turn 75, we take action, but position is already 9.\n\nIn the sequence, H=10 actions.\n\nBut let's check if this path has collision.\n\nThe path: all U, so at turn 66: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\nAction a66=U, so y67=1\n\nTurn 67: y=1, on freeway 1\n\nFreeway 1 is always safe, as we saw.\n\nAction a67=U, y68=2\n\nTurn 68: y=2, freeway 2? Freeway k is for y=k, I assume.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8, so at y=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt turn 68, t= T-66=68-66=2\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at t=8,9, not t=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 69: y=3, freeway 3, t=3, unsafe at t=8,9, not 3, safe.\n\nTurn 70: y=4, freeway 4, t=4, unsafe at t=8,9, not 4, safe? t=4, T=70, t=4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at t=8,9, so at t=4 safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 is unsafe at t=4, but we are on freeway 4 at turn 70.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4.\n\nAt turn 70, y=4, freeway 4, which is unsafe only at t=8,9, t=4 safe.\n\nNow continue.\n\nTurn 71: y=5, freeway 5, t=5\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe only at t=0, not t=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 72: y=6, freeway 6, t=6, unsafe only t=0, safe.\n\nTurn 73: y=7, freeway 7, t=7, unsafe only t=0, safe.\n\nTurn 74: y=8, freeway 8, t=8\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=0 and t=4.\n\nt=8, not 0 or 4, so should be safe?\n\nt=8, T=74.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=0 and t=4.\n\nt=4 is T=70, t=8 is T=74.\n\nAt t=8, is it safe?\n\nEarlier: freeway 8 has unsafe at t=0 and t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=0, second car has span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt t=4, first car span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt t=8, first car: span [-59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: span [-11+12*8, 12*8] = [-11+96, 96] = [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe at t=8.\n\nThen at turn 74, y=8, safe.\n\nAction a74=U, so y75=9\n\nTurn 75: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nAnd we took actions from turn 66 to 74: all U, 9 actions.\n\nH=10? Actions from t=0 to H-1, for H actions.\n\nWith 9 actions: times 66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74.\n\nAfter these, y75=9.\n\nS = turn where y=9 is 75.\n\nt1 + H -1 =66 + H -1 =75, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut with 9 actions, we have positions up to y75.\n\nThe sequence should have H actions, including the one at the reach turn or not.\n\nIn this case, for H=10, actions at 66 to 75.\n\nBut at turn 75, we take action a75, but y75 is already 9, so a75 can be S, for example, to stay, but not necessary.\n\nIn the all up path, we don't need a75, but since the sequence must have H actions, and we reached at turn 75, we can have a75=S or something.\n\nBut in the minimal path, with 9 actions U from 66 to 74, we reach at turn 75.\n\nBut the sequence for H=10 requires 10 actions, so we need to include one more.\n\nPerhaps we can set H=10, with actions U from 66 to 74, and then at 75, S for example.\n\nThen y76=9, but we reached at turn 75.\n\nSince y75=9, and we take a75, it doesn't affect reaching at 75.\n\nTo save time, we can have H=10 with the extra action.\n\nBut H=10, S=75.\n\nIs there a way with less than 9 up moves? No, because we need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, D decreases, S no change, so net +9 required, so at least 9 U, and possibly D or S, but D or S would require more turns, so minimal turns is 9 actions with all U, reaching at turn 75.\n\nWith 9 actions, turn 66 to 74, y75=9.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions, and S= t1 + H -1.\n\nWith 9 actions, S should be t1 + H -1, but actions from 66 to 74, H=9? t from 0 to 8, H=9 actions.\n\nThen S= t1 + H -1=66+9-1=74.\n\nBut y74 is not 9; in the path, y74=8, y75=9.\n\nSo to have y74=9, we need to reach earlier, but from 0, we can't reach y=9 before turn 75 with min steps.\n\nAt turn 66, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y66=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, y67 <=1.\n\nAfter 2 actions, y68 <=2, ..., after k actions, y_{66+k} <= k.\n\nSet y_S=9 at turn S.\n\nThen S - 66 <= y_S - y_{66} <= S - 66, since max increase per turn is 1.\n\ny_{66} =0, y_S=9, so S - 66 >=9, so S >=75.\n\nEarliest at turn 75.\n\nThen S=75, so t1 + H -1 =75, 66 + H -1=75, H=10.\n\nThen with H=10, we can have y75=9, with actions from 66 to 74: U, and at 75: S or U, but U would go to 10, but y=10 not allowed, must be in [0,9], so if y=9, U not allowed, so must S or D, but D to 8, not good.\n\nSo at turn 75, if y75=9, action a75 must be S to stay at 9, or D to 8, but we want to be at 9, but since we reached at turn 75, we can stay.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=10, actions a66 to a75.\n\nWith a66 to a74 all U, then a75=S.\n\nThen y75=9, and at turn 75, safe.\n\nIn the all U path, we saw that all freeways are safe at the times we are on them.\n\nIn the path:\n\nTurn 66: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\na66=U\n\nTurn 67: y=1, freeway 1, t=1, safe (always)\n\na67=U\n\nTurn 68: y=2, freeway 2, t=2, unsafe at t=8,9, safe\n\na68=U\n\nTurn 69: y=3, freeway 3, t=3, unsafe t=8,9, safe\n\na69=U\n\nTurn 70: y=4, freeway 4, t=4, unsafe t=8,9, safe? t=4, yes\n\nBut freeway 8 unsafe at t=4, but we are on freeway 4.\n\na70=U\n\nTurn 71: y=5, freeway 5, t=5, unsafe only t=0, safe\n\na71=U\n\nTurn 72: y=6, freeway 6, t=6, unsafe t=0, safe\n\na72=U\n\nTurn 73: y=7, freeway 7, t=7, unsafe t=0, safe\n\na73=U\n\nTurn 74: y=8, freeway 8, t=8, unsafe at t=0 and t=4, t=8 safe, as spans [37,48] and [85,96], 0 not in.\n\na74=U\n\nThen y75=9\n\nTurn 75: y=9, safe\n\nNow, for the sequence, H=10, actions: from turn 66 to 75.\n\na66 to a74: U, a75: S (since at y=9, cannot go up)\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be minimal H, which is 10.\n\nBut is there a problem at some point?\n\nAt turn 70, t=4, we are on freeway 4, which is safe, but freeway 8 is unsafe at t=4, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 66, we are at y=0, not on freeway, but freeways 5,6,7,8 are unsafe at t=0, but since we are not on them, no collision.\n\nIn this path, all good.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8 at t=8.\n\nt=8, T=74.\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\nFirst car: span [-59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48]\n\nSecond car: [-11 +96, 96] = [85,96]\n\n0 not in either, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in freeway 5,6,7 unsafe at t=0, but t=0 is turn 66, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 70, t=4, freeway 8 unsafe, but we are on y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nSo the all up path works with H=10.\n\nBut H=10, and we have 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can do with H=10 but start later or something, but no need.\n\nBut the player might need to avoid by staying or moving down, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier, but impossible, since S>=75.\n\nS=75 min.\n\nSo H=10 min.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 75, we have action S.\n\nNow, but the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5,6,7, at t=0, unsafe, but we not on.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 74: U\n\nThen turn 75: S\n\nBut turn 75 is part of the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, for H=10, actions at t1 to t1+9, i.e., 66 to 75.\n\nBut at turn 75, we are at y=9, and we take S.\n\nNow, but in the collision note, when we move to a new y, we are not on it until next turn, but here it doesn't apply since we stay or move vertically.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let's make sure about freeway 8 at t=4.\n\nt=4, turn 70.\n\nAt turn 70, if we were on freeway 8, unsafe.\n\nBut in our path, at turn 70, we are on y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=4: unsafe times t=8,9 for freeway 4? Freeway 4 is like freeway 2,3, unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nt=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7, there are two cars, but we only care if 0 in span at the time.\n\nAt t=0, for freeway 5, second car has span [-11,0], so 0 included, unsafe.\n\nBut at t=0, turn 66, we are at y=0, not on freeway 5.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the path seems collision-free.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nSequence: actions U from turn 66 to 74, and S at turn 75.\n\nBut turn 74 action is U to go to y=9 at turn 75.\n\nThen at turn 75, we need to specify action, which is S.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nBut H=10, actions from t=66 to 75.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 75, it is included.\n\nSince we reach at turn 75, and we take S, it is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have no action at turn 75, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to do differently? For example, if we stay at some point.\n\nBut in this case, not necessary.\n\nAt the beginning, at turn 66, if we stay, y=0, then we start later, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSimilarly, moving down not helpful.\n\nSo all up is best.\n\nBut let's confirm if at some turn we might be forced to avoid.\n\nFor example, at turn 66, if we were on freeway, but we are not.\n\nIn the path, all safe.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at t=8, but we are on it at t=8, safe.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7, at t=0 unsafe, but we not on.\n\nBut suppose at turn 66, we go up to y=1, but at turn 66, we are at y=0, choose a66, go to y=1 at turn 67.\n\nAt turn 67, we are on y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe current turn is t1=66.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 66:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74:  U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75:  S \\end{array} }\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is turn 75 necessary? Since we reach at turn 75, and action S is taken, but position is already 9.\n\nTo save one action, but we can't, because H must include until the reach turn action or something.\n\nSuppose we have only 9 actions: a66 to a74 all U.\n\nThen y75=9, reached at turn 75.\n\nBut S = t1 + H -1, with H=9, S=66+9-1=74, but y74=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need y_{t1+H-1}=9, which for H=9, turn 74, y=8 not 9.\n\nSo must have S=75, H=10.\n\nThus, the sequence includes the action at the reached turn.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at turn 75 with fewer actions, but no, min 9 up moves.\n\nWith downs, it would take more actions.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, it has two cars, but at t=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 66\\) is 10. This is achieved by moving up (U) for the first 9 turns (turns 66 to 74) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 75, and then staying (S) at turn 75 to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 66, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 67.\n- At turn 67, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 68.\n- At turn 68, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 69.\n- At turn 69, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 70.\n- At turn 70, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 71.\n- At turn 71, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 72.\n- At turn 72, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 73.\n- At turn 73, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 74.\n- At turn 74, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 75.\n- At turn 75, action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis path avoids collisions with all cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- Freeway 1 is always safe, as the car span never covers 0 for \\(t \\geq 0\\).\n- Freeways 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe only at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (turns 74 and 75), but the player is not on these freeways at those times (on freeway 2 at turn 68, \\(t = 2\\); freeway 3 at turn 69, \\(t = 3\\); freeway 4 at turn 70, \\(t = 4\\)).\n- Freeways 5, 6, and 7 are unsafe only at \\(t = 0\\) (turn 66), but the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (not on a freeway) at turn 66.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 4\\) (turns 66 and 70), but the player is not on freeway 8 at those times (on freeway 8 at turn 74, \\(t = 8\\), where it is safe).\n\nThus, the sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 66:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75:  S \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 72. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U (up) increases y by 1, D (down) decreases y by 1, S (stay) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollisions happen only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Importantly, when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only on y_T during turn T, not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So, for collision check, at turn T, we care only about freeway y_T.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k (which I assume is y=k, so freeways 1 to 8).\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, it's moving right, so at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and at T, \"[τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSimilarly for left, but all cars here seem to be right-moving, based on direction.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). Head 48, tail 37? But if direction is right, and head is larger, that makes sense, head is the front when moving right.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span is [h, τ], but here all are right, I think.\n\nFreeway 1: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3), so at t_1, span is [37, 48] since right-moving.\n\nThen at time T, span is [37 + 3*(T - t_1), 48 + 3*(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). Head -48, tail -59? But if moving right, head should be larger, but -48 > -59, so yes, head is larger.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 6*(T - t_1), -48 + 6*(T - t_1)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 and 3: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: span at t_1: [37,48]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), so head=0, tail=-11, span at t_1: [-11,0]\n\nAt T: for first car: [37 + 12*(T-t_1), 48 + 12*(T-t_1)]\n\nFor second car: [-11 + 12*(T-t_1), 0 + 12*(T-t_1)] = [-11 + 12Δ, 12Δ] where Δ = T - t_1\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at t_1: [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 12Δ, -48 + 12Δ] where Δ = T - t_1\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), span at T: [-11 + 12Δ, 12Δ]\n\nNow, t_1 = 72, so Δ = T - 72.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at t_1=72. We need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn, the minimum number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, then after 9 turns, y=9.\n\nBut we might have to avoid cars, so we might need to stay or go down sometimes, which could take more turns. Or, if we can find a path with no collisions in 9 turns, that would be minimal.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible in 9 turns.\n\nThe player position at turn T: y_T, starting from T = t_1 = 72, y_72 = 0.\n\nThen for each turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we need that for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is not in any car's span on that freeway.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on the same freeway at the same time.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so at turn t_1=72, we are at (0,0), which might be safe because y=0 has no cars. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut when we are on a freeway, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn T, we are on y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to check the cars on that row.\n\nNow, for the minimal path, since we need to go up to 9, and down might not help, probably we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nBut let's analyze the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, we need to find when the car spans cover x=0.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, we care about when 0 is in some car's span on the freeway we are on.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and for each car on k, we need to find times T when 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nThen, for a given time T and freeway k, if k has a car where 0 is in span at T, then if player is on k at T, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, let's define Δ = T - t_1 = T - 72.\n\nSo for each freeway, let's find the times when x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, right-moving, s=3.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 3Δ, 48 + 3Δ]\n\n0 is in span if 37 + 3Δ <= 0 <= 48 + 3Δ\n\nSince the car is moving right, and span is increasing.\n\n37 + 3Δ <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 3Δ\n\nFirst, 0 <= 48 + 3Δ is always true for Δ >= 0 since 48 + 3Δ >= 48 > 0.\n\n48 + 3Δ is at least 48 when Δ=0, which is >0, so 0 <= 48 + 3Δ always true for all Δ.\n\nThen 37 + 3Δ <= 0? 37 + 3Δ <= 0 implies 3Δ <= -37, so Δ <= -37/3 ≈ -12.333, but Δ = T - 72 >=0 since T >= t_1, so 37 + 3Δ >= 37 >0, so 37 + 3Δ >0 always, thus 0 is never <= 37 + 3Δ? Let's see the inequality.\n\n0 is in [L, R] if L <= 0 and 0 <= R.\n\nHere L = 37 + 3Δ, R = 48 + 3Δ.\n\nL = 37 + 3Δ >= 37 >0, so L >0, thus 0 < L <= R, so 0 < L <= R, so 0 is less than L, not >= L, so 0 is not in [L,R] because L >0.\n\nFor example at Δ=0, L=37, R=48, 0 not in [37,48].\n\nAs Δ increases, L and R increase, so 0 is always left of L, never in the span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at no time is x=0 occupied. The car is always to the right, moving further right.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nAt Δ=0, span [37,48], 0 not in it.\n\nAt larger Δ, even farther right, so yes, freeway 1 has no car at x=0 ever. So it's always safe to be on freeway 1 at any time.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 6Δ, -48 + 6Δ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6Δ <= 0 <= -48 + 6Δ\n\nFirst, -59 + 6Δ <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 6Δ\n\n0 <= -48 + 6Δ implies 6Δ >= 48, so Δ >= 8\n\n-59 + 6Δ <= 0 implies 6Δ <= 59, Δ <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSo for Δ from 8 to 9.833, approximately.\n\nSince Δ must be integer? T is turn, so Δ integer, I assume.\n\nT is discrete turns, so Δ integer.\n\nSo Δ >=8 and Δ <=9.833, so Δ=8 or 9.\n\nAt Δ=8: L = -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nR = -48 + 48 = 0? -48 + 6*8 = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span at Δ=8: [-11, 0]\n\n0 is in [-11,0]? 0 <= 0 is true, and -11 <=0 true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nAt Δ=9: L = -59 + 54 = -5? -59 + 6*9 = -59 + 54 = -5\n\nR = -48 + 54 = 6\n\nSpan [-5,6], 0 is in it since -5 <=0<=6.\n\nAt Δ=10: L = -59 + 60 =1, R= -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, Δ=7: L= -59+42= -17, R= -48+42= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, 0 is occupied at Δ=8 and Δ=9, i.e., T=72+8=80 and T=72+9=81.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSo same, occupied at Δ=8 and 9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied at Δ=8 and 9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span at T: [37 +12Δ, 48+12Δ]\n\nL=37+12Δ >0 always, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), span: [-11 +12Δ, 0 +12Δ] = [-11 +12Δ, 12Δ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12Δ <= 0 <= 12Δ\n\n0 <= 12Δ always for Δ>=0.\n\n-11 +12Δ <= 0 implies 12Δ <=11, Δ <=11/12≈0.916, so since Δ>=0 integer, only Δ=0 possible? But at Δ=0, L= -11 +0= -11, R=0, span [-11,0], 0 in it? -11 <=0 <=0, yes.\n\nBut at Δ=0, T=t_1=72.\n\nNow, -11 +12Δ <=0 for Δ<=11/12<1, so only Δ=0.\n\nAt Δ=0, -11 +0 = -11 <=0, and 0<=0, yes.\n\nAt Δ=1, L= -11+12=1, R=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 occupied only at Δ=0.\n\nBut freeway 5 has two cars, but the first car never has 0, second only at Δ=0.\n\nSo at T=t_1, Δ=0, freeway 5 is occupied at x=0.\n\nFor other times, not occupied.\n\nSpecifically, at Δ=0, T=72.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as 5: two cars, same as above.\n\nFirst car: no 0, second car: occupied only at Δ=0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, occupied only at Δ=0.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span: [-59 +12Δ, -48 +12Δ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12Δ <=0 <= -48 +12Δ\n\nWhich is 12Δ <=59 and 12Δ >=48, so Δ <= 59/12≈4.916, Δ >=48/12=4\n\nSo Δ=4 or 4.916, integer Δ=4.\n\nAt Δ=4: L= -59 +48= -11, R= -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δ=5: L= -59+60=1, R= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), same as before, span [-11+12Δ, 12Δ]\n\n0 in span only at Δ=0, as before.\n\nAt Δ=0, occupied.\n\nBut for freeway 8, at Δ=0, second car is at (0,-11,right,12), span [-11,0], so 0 occupied.\n\nAnd first car at Δ=4.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at Δ=0 and Δ=4.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when x=0 is occupied (collision if on that freeway at that time):\n\n- Freeway 1: never occupied, always safe.\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at Δ=8,9 (T=80,81)\n\n- Freeway 3: same, occupied at Δ=8,9\n\n- Freeway 4: same, occupied at Δ=8,9\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at Δ=0 (T=72)\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied at Δ=0\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied at Δ=0\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at Δ=0 and Δ=4 (T=72 and T=76)\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at T=72.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no collision at start.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we only care about freeways 1-8 during the path.\n\nThe minimal H would be 9 if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn T=72, we are at y=72? No, turn T, position y_T.\n\nNotation: at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAction a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we perform action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position during turn t is y_t.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T.\n\nStart at T=72, y_72 = 0.\n\nWe perform a_72, then y_73 = y_72 + Δy_72.\n\nThen at turn 73, we are at y_73, and so on.\n\nWe need to find actions a_{72}, a_{73}, ..., up to some H where y_{72 + H - 1} = 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, and after H actions, we reach y_{t_1 + H} = 9? I think I have off-by-one.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nSet t_1 = 72.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nWe apply action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 + 1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + 1, position is (0, y_{t_1 + 1})\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter applying H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy = 0 +1 if U, so y=1, but we need to reach y=9, so H=1 not enough.\n\nMinimal H is 9: if we do U each turn, after 9 actions, y_{72+9} = y_{81} = 0 +9 =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H = 72 + H.\n\ny_{72 + H} =9 after H actions.\n\nWith H=9, at turn 81, y=9.\n\nNow, during the path, from turn 72 to turn 80, we are at various y positions.\n\nAt each turn T from 72 to 80, we are at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, we need to avoid collision at that T.\n\nTurn T=72: y_72=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen after action a_72, y_73 set.\n\nAt turn T=73, position y_73, and so on, up to turn T=80, position y_80, and at turn T=81, we reach y_81=9 if all U, but y_81=9 is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, the last turn we need to check is when we are on freeway, up to y_80, since at y_81=9, safe.\n\nT from 72 to 80 inclusive for positions on freeway possible.\n\nList turns: T=72: y_72=0, safe\n\nT=73: y_73\n\n...\n\nT=80: y_80\n\nT=81: y_81=9, safe (if reached)\n\nFor collision, we care about T from 73 to 80, since y_72 and y_81 are safe.\n\ny_72=0 safe, y_81=9 safe if we reach it.\n\nNow, with minimal path, y_T = T - 72, if we go up each turn.\n\nStart T=72, y=0\n\nAfter a_72=U, y_73=1\n\nT=73, y=1\n\nAfter a_73=U, y_74=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_79=U, y_80=8\n\nT=80, y=8\n\nAfter a_80=U, y_81=9\n\nT=81, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, we need to check for each T from 73 to 80, if on freeway y_T, and if collision at that T.\n\ny_T = T - 72 for T from 73 to 80.\n\nT=73: y=1, freeway 1\n\nT=74: y=2, freeway 2\n\nT=75: y=3, freeway 3\n\nT=76: y=4, freeway 4\n\nT=77: y=5, freeway 5\n\nT=78: y=6, freeway 6\n\nT=79: y=7, freeway 7\n\nT=80: y=8, freeway 8\n\nNow, check for each:\n\nFirst, freeway 1: always safe, as we saw. So at T=73, y=1, safe.\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at Δ=8,9. Δ = T - t_1 = T - 72.\n\nAt T=73, Δ=1, not 8 or 9, so safe? Freeway 2 occupied at Δ=8,9, which are T=80,81.\n\nBut at T=74, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nT=74, Δ=74-72=2, not 8 or 9, so freeway 2 is not occupied at Δ=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 at T=75, y=3, Δ=3, not 8 or 9, safe.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=76, y=4, Δ=4, not 8 or 9, safe.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=77, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 occupied only at Δ=0, which is T=72.\n\nAt T=77, Δ=5, not 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at T=78, y=6, Δ=6, not 0, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=79, y=7, Δ=7, not 0, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=80, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at Δ=0 and Δ=4.\n\nΔ=0: T=72\n\nΔ=4: T=76\n\nAt T=80, Δ=8, not 0 or 4, so should be safe?\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at Δ=0 and Δ=4, which are T=72 and T=76.\n\nAt T=80, Δ=8, not occupied, so safe.\n\nIn all cases above, for the direct up path, at each step, no collision.\n\nT=73: y=1, safe\n\nT=74: y=2, Δ=2, freeway 2 not occupied at Δ=2, safe\n\nT=75: y=3, freeway 3, same, not occ at Δ=3\n\nT=76: y=4, freeway 4, not occ at Δ=4? Freeway 4 occupied at Δ=8,9, not at Δ=4.\n\nΔ=4 is T=76.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at Δ=8,9, so at Δ=4, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=77: y=5, freeway 5, occ only at Δ=0, not at Δ=5\n\nT=78: y=6, same\n\nT=79: y=7, same\n\nT=80: y=8, freeway 8, occ at Δ=0 and Δ=4, not at Δ=8, so safe.\n\nThen at T=81, y=9, safe.\n\nSo actually, with all U actions, we can reach in 9 turns with no collision.\n\nIs that possible? But let me double-check freeway 8 at T=80.\n\nFreeway 8: cars at Δ=0 and Δ=4 occupied.\n\nΔ=8: first car span: [-59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11 +12*8, 12*8] = [-11+96, 96] = [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other points are safe as above.\n\nBut at T=72, we are at y=0, not on freeway, and we move to y=1 at turn 73, but at turn 72, no issue.\n\nIn this path, we never have issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 5,6,7 occupied at Δ=0, but that is only at T=72, and at T=72, we are at y=0, not on those freeways.\n\nSimilarly, at T=76, freeway 8 occupied, but at T=76, in this path, we are at y=4 (since T=76, y=76-72=4? T=76, y_T = y_76.\n\nIn sequence: T=72, y=0\n\nT=73, y=1\n\nT=74, y=2\n\nT=75, y=3\n\nT=76, y=4\n\nFreeway 4 at T=76, but freeway 4 is occupied only at Δ=8,9, not at Δ=4, so safe.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at Δ=4, which is T=76, but at T=76, we are on y=4, which is freeway 4, not freeway 8.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, the direct up path is collision-free and takes 9 turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nActions: a_72 to a_80, all U.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nThen at turn 81, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H=9, actions at t=72 to 80.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nBut is there any problem?\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn 72.\n\nAfter a_72=U, at turn 73, position (0,1)\n\nWe need to make sure that when we move, the collision is only at the current turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we decide action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}, but the collision is based on y_T at turn T.\n\nIn this case, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 5 at some point.\n\nIn the path, we are on freeway 5 at T=77, y=5, Δ=5.\n\nFreeway 5: cars: first car span [37+12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12*5, 12*5]=[-11+60,60]=[49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut freeway 2 at T=74, y=2, Δ=2.\n\nFreeway 2 car: span [-59 +6*2, -48 +6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do in 9 turns.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? No, because we need to increase y by 9, each action can increase by at most 1, so minimum 9 actions.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nAnd this sequence works.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7,8, there are two cars, but in the path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n\nBut the current turn is t_1=72, and player position (0,0), as given.\n\nSo sequence:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 72: U \\\\ Turn 73: U \\\\ Turn 74: U \\\\ Turn 75: U \\\\ Turn 76: U \\\\ Turn 77: U \\\\ Turn 78: U \\\\ Turn 79: U \\\\ Turn 80: U }\n\nBut let's count: actions from t=72 to t=80, that's 9 actions: 72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80.\n\nAfter a_80=U, y_81 = y_80 +1 =8+1=9, since y_80=8.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the format.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0), and we start action at t_1.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify the turns.\n\nBut in the box, it should be fine.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7, at Δ=0, occupied, but we are not there at T=72.\n\nSimilarly, at T=76, freeway 8 occupied, but we are on y=4.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=76, we are on y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at Δ=8,9, not at Δ=4.\n\nΔ=4, T=76, freeway 4 car: span [-59 +6*4, -48 +6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can do it faster, but no, 9 is minimum.\n\nOr with S, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the freeway 8, it has two cars, but at different times occupied.\n\nBut in path, no issue.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9 with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 72\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns required to move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 9, as each action can increase \\(y\\) by at most 1. A sequence of all \"U\" (up) actions achieves this, increasing \\(y\\) by 1 each turn.\n\nTo verify collision avoidance:\n- Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) at turn \\(T\\), and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n- The car spans and their occupancy at \\(x = 0\\) were analyzed for each freeway and turn relative to \\(\\Delta = T - 72\\):\n  - Freeway 1: Always safe; no car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at any \\(\\Delta\\).\n  - Freeway 2: Occupied at \\(\\Delta = 8\\) (\\(T = 80\\)) and \\(\\Delta = 9\\) (\\(T = 81\\)); safe at other times.\n  - Freeway 3: Same as Freeway 2; occupied at \\(T = 80\\) and \\(T = 81\\); safe at other times.\n  - Freeway 4: Same as Freeway 2; occupied at \\(T = 80\\) and \\(T = 81\\); safe at other times.\n  - Freeway 5: Occupied at \\(\\Delta = 0\\) (\\(T = 72\\)); safe at other times.\n  - Freeway 6: Same as Freeway 5; occupied at \\(T = 72\\); safe at other times.\n  - Freeway 7: Same as Freeway 5; occupied at \\(T = 72\\); safe at other times.\n  - Freeway 8: Occupied at \\(\\Delta = 0\\) (\\(T = 72\\)) and \\(\\Delta = 4\\) (\\(T = 76\\)); safe at other times.\n\nThe sequence of positions and actions for the all-\"U\" path:\n- Turn 72: Start at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway). Action \\(a_{72} = U\\), so \\(y_{73} = 1\\).\n- Turn 73: At \\(y = 1\\) (Freeway 1, safe).

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player will be on y_{T+1}. So when moving, we only check the freeway we are currently on (at the start of the turn) for collision.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=78. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost? Actually, the update rule specifies:\n\nFor left-moving: initially [h, tau] at t1, then at T>t1: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: initially [tau, h] at t1? Actually the notation is: \n  Left: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n  Right: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]   (so initially the head is at the front of movement: for right, head is the rightmost? But the initial state is given as (head, tail, ...). \n\nLooking at the example for freeway 5: \n  (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor the first car: head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, the update rule uses [tau, h] initially? Actually, the update rule says:\n  Right: initially [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nBut the input gives (head, tail, ...). So we must interpret:\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the rightmost if moving right) and the tail is the rear? So the initial span for a right-moving car is [tail, head]? \n\nBut the update rule says: for right-moving, initial span is [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So if the input for a right-moving car is (head, tail, d, s), then we have:\n  initial head = h, initial tail = tau -> but the update rule uses [tau, h] as the initial span? \n\nSo for a right-moving car, the initial span at t1 is [tail, head]. Similarly, for left-moving, the initial span is [head, tail] (which would be [h, tau] as given).\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n- For a right-moving car: at time t1, the car occupies [tail, head] (with tail < head, because the car is moving right and the head is the front).\n- For a left-moving car: at time t1, the car occupies [head, tail] (and note that for left-moving, head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost, so head < tail? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost, so the span is [head, tail] and head < tail? But in the update, they use [h, tau] and then subtract s*dt, so the entire car moves left.\n\nBut looking at the data: all cars in the input are right-moving? The direction is given as \"right\". And the values: \n  Freeway1: (48,37,right,3) -> so tail=37, head=48? But 37<48, so the car spans [37,48] at t1=78? \n\nBut then for freeway5: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] and (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11,0]? \n\nWait, at t1=78, the car on freeway5 has two cars: one from 37 to 48 and one from -11 to 0? \n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe need to compute, for each freeway and for each future turn, whether the car spans at that turn cover 0.\n\nBut note: the player is at x=0 always? So we only care about whether 0 is in the car's span at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe are at turn 78 at (0,0). We need to get to (0,9). We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9 (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe must plan a path from y=0 (turn78) to y=9 (at some turn) without being on a freeway y (for y in {1,2,...,8}) at a turn when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns. The cars move at constant speeds.\n\nFirst, let's compute the position of each car at an arbitrary turn T (>=78). Let dt = T - 78.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car (head=48, tail=37, right, speed=3)\n  Since right-moving: initial span at 78: [37, 48] (because [tail, head] = [37,48])\n  At turn T: [37 + 3*dt, 48 + 3*dt]\n\nFor freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6)\n  Initial: [tail, head] = [-59, -48] (since tail=-59, head=-48)\n  At turn T: [-59 + 6*dt, -48 + 6*dt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 are same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: \n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> initial [37,48]; at T: [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> initial [-11,0]; at T: [-11+12*dt, 0+12*dt]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5: two cars with the same parameters? \n  So: [37+12*dt,48+12*dt] and [-11+12*dt,12*dt]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway5.\n\nFreeway 8: \n  car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> initial: [ -59, -48 ]; at T: [ -59+12*dt, -48+12*dt ]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> same as above: [-11+12*dt,12*dt]\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway k at turn T if 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, we are starting at turn78 at y=0. Note: at y=0, we are not on any freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe need to traverse y=1 to y=8 without collision.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H such that we can go from y=0 to y=9 in H moves (so H turns: from turn78 to turn78+H-1, and at turn78+H-1 we are at y=9).\n\nWe can use BFS in state (turn, y) but note that turn can be large? However, we can compute the car positions relative to time and note that the car patterns are periodic? Actually, the cars are moving at constant speeds and the road is infinite? But we only care about when the car spans cover 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 78) the safety: whether freeway k is safe at turn T (i.e., 0 is not in any car span on k at T).\n\nBut note: we are at turn78 at y=0. We can only move one step per turn. We are going to simulate the moves.\n\nWe need to compute the safety for freeways 1..8 for turns 78,79,80,... until we find a path.\n\nLet's compute the time intervals when each freeway is unsafe.\n\nFor freeway k, we want: 0 is in one of the car spans at turn T? Then unsafe.\n\nWe compute for each car on freeway k, the time interval [t_start, t_end] during which 0 is in its span? But note: the car span is moving. Actually, the car is present at 0 when:\n\nFor a right-moving car: [a + s*dt, b + s*dt] contains 0? \n  0 in [a + s*dt, b + s*dt] \n  => a + s*dt <= 0 <= b + s*dt \n  => (0 - b)/s <= dt <= (0 - a)/s   [if s>0]\n\nBut note: if a and b are the initial (at dt=0) endpoints? Actually, at T=78, dt=0.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k:\n\n  Let dt = T - 78.\n\n  For a right-moving car with initial [a,b] (a<=b) and speed s:\n      0 in [a + s*dt, b + s*dt] \n      <=> a + s*dt <= 0 <= b + s*dt\n      <=> dt >= ( -a ) / s   and   dt <= ( -b ) / s? \n\n  Actually: \n      a + s*dt <= 0  => dt <= ( -a ) / s   [if s>0, then inequality direction remains]\n      and \n      0 <= b + s*dt  => dt >= ( -b ) / s\n\n  But note: because a<=b, then ( -b ) / s <= ( -a ) / s (if s>0). So the interval is [ (-b)/s, (-a)/s ]? \n\n  However, let's test with freeway5 car2: \n      initial: [-11, 0] at dt=0 -> then at dt=0, 0 is included? \n      condition: \n          a = -11, b = 0, s=12.\n          Then: \n            dt >= ( -b ) / s = 0/12 = 0\n            dt <= ( -a ) / s = 11/12\n          So for dt in [0, 11/12] -> but dt is integer? \n\n  Actually, T is integer, so dt is integer. Then at dt=0: [ -11, 0] contains 0 -> unsafe.\n          at dt=1: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  But our condition: \n        dt >= ceil( (-b)/s )? Actually, we need to be careful.\n\n  Alternatively, we can solve:\n        a + s*dt <= 0 <= b + s*dt\n\n  =>   -b/s <= dt <= -a/s   (if s>0, and note a<=b so -b/s <= -a/s)\n\n  But at dt=0: -0/12=0 and -(-11)/12 = 11/12 -> then 0 is in [0, 11/12]? But 0 is included? Actually, the inequality is inclusive.\n\n  However, we are using real intervals, but dt is integer. So we need the integer dt such that:\n        dt >= ceil( (-b)/s )?   -> but wait, the condition is:\n        dt must satisfy: \n          a + s*dt <= 0   => dt <= floor( (-a)/s )   [because dt integer, and we need a+s*dt<=0, so the maximum dt that satisfies is floor((-a)/s)? Actually, no:]\n\n  Actually, we can compute the real solution and then the integer solutions.\n\n  For a car: \n        L = ( -b ) / s   [because from 0<=b+s*dt -> dt>= -b/s]\n        R = ( -a ) / s   [because a+s*dt<=0 -> dt<= (-a)/s]\n\n  Then the car covers 0 for dt in [L, R]. Since dt is integer, we take all integers dt such that:\n        ceil(L) <= dt <= floor(R)   ? \n\n  But note: if L and R are integers, then we include L and R.\n\n  Actually, the condition for integer dt: \n        dt >= ceil(L) and dt <= floor(R)   [if L and R are real numbers]\n\n  However, let me test with the example: \n        car: [-11,0] at dt=0, s=12.\n        L = (-0)/12 = 0, R = -(-11)/12 = 11/12 = 0.916...\n        Then ceil(L)=ceil(0)=0, floor(R)=floor(0.916)=0.\n        So only dt=0.\n\n  Another example: a car that covers 0 at dt=1: say [1,2] at dt=0? But then at dt=0, 0 not covered. Then at dt=1: [1+12, 2+12] = [13,14] -> no. \n\n  Let me take a car that at dt=1 covers 0: \n        We want: at dt=1: the span [a+12, b+12] contains 0 -> so a+12<=0<=b+12 -> a<=-12, b>=-12? \n        Example: a=-12, b=-10 -> then at dt=1: [0,2] -> contains 0.\n        Then L = ( -b )/s = 10/12 = 0.833 -> ceil(0.833)=1\n               R = ( -a )/s = 12/12=1 -> floor(1)=1 -> so dt=1.\n\n  So the formula: \n        unsafe for dt in [ ceil( (-b)/s ), floor( (-a)/s ) ]   [for right-moving]\n\n  But note: the condition is: \n        a + s*dt <= 0   -> dt <= (-a)/s   -> so the maximum dt is floor( (-a)/s )? Actually, we want the largest integer dt that satisfies dt<= (-a)/s -> that's floor( (-a)/s ). \n        and \n        dt >= ceil( (-b)/s )\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving: \n        The car: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] contains 0?\n        h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt \n        => h/s <= dt <= tau/s   [if s>0, then we can rearrange: \n                from h - s*dt <=0 -> dt>= h/s\n                from 0<=tau-s*dt -> dt<= tau/s]\n\n        So unsafe for dt in [ceil(h/s), floor(tau/s)]\n\nBut note: in our problem, all cars are right-moving? The input only has \"right\". So we only need the formula for right-moving.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway and each car the unsafe time intervals (in terms of dt = T - 78).\n\nFreeway 1: one car (37,48,right,3) -> initial [37,48] -> a=37, b=48, s=3.\n  L = (-48)/3 = -16\n  R = (-37)/3 ≈ -12.333\n  Then unsafe for dt in [ceil(-16), floor(-12.333)] = [-16, -13]? But dt>=0? So no unsafe at dt>=0? \n  Check: at dt=0: [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> safe.\n  So freeway1 is always safe for dt>=0.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-59,-48,right,6) -> initial [-59,-48] -> a=-59, b=-48, s=6.\n  L = (48)/6 = 8\n  R = (59)/6 ≈ 9.833\n  Then unsafe for dt in [ceil(8), floor(9.833)] = [8,9]\n  So at dt=8 and 9 (i.e., turn78+8=86 and 87) the freeway2 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2 -> unsafe at dt=8,9.\n\nFreeway4: same -> unsafe at dt=8,9.\n\nFreeway5: two cars.\n  car1: (37,48,right,12) -> a=37, b=48, s=12.\n      L = (-48)/12 = -4\n      R = (-37)/12 ≈ -3.083\n      unsafe: [ceil(-4), floor(-3.083)] = [-4, -4]? -> dt=-4? But dt>=0 -> safe.\n  car2: (-11,0,right,12) -> a=-11, b=0, s=12.\n      L = (0)/12=0\n      R = (11)/12≈0.916\n      unsafe: [ceil(0), floor(0.916)] = [0,0] -> only at dt=0 (turn78) is unsafe.\n\n  Therefore, freeway5 is unsafe at dt=0 (turn78) and safe for dt>=1.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5 -> unsafe at dt=0, safe for dt>=1.\n\nFreeway7: same -> unsafe at dt=0, safe for dt>=1.\n\nFreeway8: \n  car1: (-59,-48,right,12) -> a=-59, b=-48, s=12.\n        L = (48)/12=4\n        R = (59)/12≈4.916\n        unsafe: [ceil(4), floor(4.916)] = [4,4] -> only dt=4 (turn78+4=82) unsafe.\n  car2: (-11,0,right,12) -> same as above: unsafe at dt=0.\n\n  Therefore, freeway8 is unsafe at dt=0 and dt=4.\n\nSummary for each freeway and for dt>=0 (turn = 78+dt):\n\nFreeway1: safe for all dt.\nFreeway2: unsafe at dt=8,9; safe otherwise.\nFreeway3: same as 2 -> unsafe at 8,9.\nFreeway4: same -> unsafe at 8,9.\nFreeway5: unsafe at dt=0; safe for dt>=1.\nFreeway6: same as 5 -> unsafe at dt=0, safe for dt>=1.\nFreeway7: same -> unsafe at dt=0, safe for dt>=1.\nFreeway8: unsafe at dt=0 and dt=4.\n\nWe are at turn78 (dt=0) at y=0. We need to get to y=9.\n\nAt turn78 (dt=0), we are at y=0. We are not on a freeway? So safe.\n\nWe can choose action: U, D, or S. But we want to go up, so U is natural. But we have to avoid unsafe freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We note:\n\n- We start at turn78 (dt=0) at y=0.\n- At each turn, we choose an action (U, D, S) and then the next y is y+Δy, and then we check: at the turn we are on, if we are on a freeway (y in [1,8]) and that freeway is unsafe at that turn (dt = current turn - 78), then we crash.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1) in state (y, dt) where dt is the number of turns elapsed (so turn = 78+dt). We start at (0,0). We want to reach (9, any_dt).\n\nConstraints: y must be in [0,9], and if y in [1,8] then the freeway must be safe at dt.\n\nWe consider actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we can also wait (S) to avoid bad times.\n\nWe are going to compute the minimal dt (i.e., minimal turns) to reach y=9.\n\nWe note that we can move at most 9 steps up? But we might need to wait.\n\nLet me try to find a path:\n\nOption 1: go straight up without waiting.\n\n  Turn78 (dt=0): at y=0 -> safe (not on freeway). \n      Action: U -> then at turn79 (dt=1): y=1.\n\n  Now at turn79 (dt=1): we are on freeway1 -> freeway1 is always safe? \n      Action: U -> turn80 (dt=2): y=2 -> freeway2? \n          freeway2: unsafe at dt=8,9 -> at dt=2 safe -> safe.\n      Action: U -> turn81 (dt=3): y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at dt=8,9 -> safe.\n      Action: U -> turn82 (dt=4): y=4 -> freeway4: unsafe at dt=8,9 -> safe? \n      Action: U -> turn83 (dt=5): y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe only at dt=0 -> at dt=5 safe -> safe.\n      Action: U -> turn84 (dt=6): y=6 -> freeway6: safe (dt>=1 and dt=6) -> safe.\n      Action: U -> turn85 (dt=7): y=7 -> freeway7: safe -> safe.\n      Action: U -> turn86 (dt=8): y=8 -> freeway8: unsafe at dt=0 and 4 -> at dt=8 safe? \n          But wait: we computed freeway8 unsafe at dt=4? and dt=0. dt=8 is safe? \n          freeway8: we have unsafe at dt=0 and 4 -> so at dt=8 safe? \n          However, we must check the car spans? \n          For freeway8: \n            car1: at dt=8: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> safe.\n            car2: at dt=8: [-11+12*8, 0+12*8] = [85,96] -> safe.\n          So yes, safe.\n\n      Then Action: U -> turn87 (dt=9): y=9 -> we are done.\n\n  So sequence: 9 moves: U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U -> 9 turns? \n\n  But wait: at turn78 we are at y0, then after 9 moves (from turn78 to turn86: 9 moves? Actually, from turn78 to turn86 is 8 moves? Let me count:\n\n      turn78: start at y0.\n      turn78: action U -> at turn79: y1.\n      turn79: action U -> turn80: y2.\n      turn80: U -> turn81: y3.\n      turn81: U -> turn82: y4.\n      turn82: U -> turn83: y5.\n      turn83: U -> turn84: y6.\n      turn84: U -> turn85: y7.\n      turn85: U -> turn86: y8.\n      turn86: U -> turn87: y9.\n\n  So we need 9 actions: from turn78 to turn86 (inclusive) we do 9 actions? Actually, the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and H is the number of turns. So we do 9 actions? \n\n  But at turn87 we are at y9? So we stop at the end of turn86? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: we are at turn t1 (78) at (0,0). Then we do an action at turn t1 (78) to move to y1 at turn79. Then at turn79 we do an action, and so on until we are at y9 at some turn.\n\n  We are at y9 at turn87. So we did 9 actions: at turns 78,79,...,86.\n\n  H=9.\n\n  But is it safe? \n\n  We must check for each turn we are on a freeway:\n\n      At turn79 (dt=1): y=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n      turn80 (dt=2): y=2 -> freeway2: safe (since unsafe only at dt=8,9).\n      turn81 (dt=3): y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n      turn82 (dt=4): y=4 -> freeway4: safe? \n          freeway4: unsafe at dt=8,9 -> so safe at dt=4.\n      turn83 (dt=5): y=5 -> freeway5: safe (dt>=1 and not 0).\n      turn84 (dt=6): y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n      turn85 (dt=7): y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n      turn86 (dt=8): y=8 -> freeway8: safe? \n          We computed freeway8 unsafe at dt=0 and 4 -> dt=8 is safe? \n          But wait: we computed unsafe at dt=4 for freeway8? \n          At dt=4: freeway8: \n            car1: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> wait, 0 is included? \n            Actually: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> so unsafe at dt=4.\n          But we are at freeway8 at dt=8? \n          car1: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [37,48] -> 0 not included.\n          car2: [-11+12*8, 0+12*8] = [85,96] -> safe.\n          So yes, safe.\n\n  Then at turn86 (dt=8) we do U -> at turn87 (dt=9) we are at y9 -> safe (not on freeway).\n\n  So the entire path is safe.\n\n  Therefore, minimal H is 9? \n\nBut wait, is there a shorter path? We start at y0 and need to get to y9: the minimal number of moves is 9 (since we can only move one per turn). So yes, 9 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we might be able to get there in 9 moves? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are counting the actions: from t1 to t1+H-1 we do H actions? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\" and then we reach at turn t1+H-1 the goal? \n\nAt turn t1 (78) we are at (0,0). After H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at the next state? \n\nAfter H actions, we have done H moves and we are at turn78+H. But the problem says: we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \n  \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t1, we are at (0,0). Then we do action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> then at the start of turn t1+1, we are at y1. Then ... then after doing the last action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, then at the start of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the condition is: y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nActually, the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo if we do an action at turn t, it affects the state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, after the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, we have:\n\n  At turn t1: state (0,0) -> then action a_{t1} -> at turn t1+1: y1 = 0 + Δy_{t1}\n  ...\n  At turn t1+H-1: we do action a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we finish? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are already at y=9? Then we don't need to do an action at that turn? \n\nBut then the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nLet me re-read: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns: \n  t = 0 -> a_{t1+0} at turn t1\n  t = 1 -> a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  t = H-1 -> a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1\n\nAnd we require that at the end of these actions, the state at the next turn (which is t1+H) would be? Actually, the state after the action a_{t} is at turn t+1.\n\nSo after a_{t1+H-1} we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}. \n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That is, at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? Then we don't need to move? But we are already at 9? \n\nBut we start at y0=0 at turn78. How can we be at 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the state is at the start of the turn. At the start of turn t1 (78), we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action. The action will move us to the next state at the start of turn t1+1.\n\nSo if we do nothing (S) at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we are still at 0.\n\nBut we want at the start of turn t1+H-1 to be at 9.\n\nTherefore, we need to get to 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, meaning that the last action that moved us to 9 was done at turn t1+H-2? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we do H actions and then at the next state (after H actions) we are at 9. Then the state at turn t1+H is 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9, so we don't need to move? However, the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the goal condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9. So if we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to do an action? But the sequence requires H actions, the last one at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand \n  \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo it says: after the actions, the position at the next state (which is the state at the start of turn t1+H) is 9? \n\nBut no: the state at the start of turn t is y_t. Then we do a_t and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δa_t.\n\nTherefore, after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we have:\n      y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δa_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe require y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which is the state at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \n  \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo they require that the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nThat means we have already reached 9 by the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9, so we can do any action? But if we do U, we would go to 10 which is invalid? \n\nActually, the constraint: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, that is invalid. Similarly, D to 8? But we are at 9 and then we do an action? The problem doesn't say we must stay at 9 after the action? It only requires that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo we can do an action at turn t1+H-1 that might move us away? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is 9. Then the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is not used to get to 9? \n\nActually, we got to 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1 by the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\nSo the last action that matters is at turn t1+H-2. Then we have one extra action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the problem says we must reach (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we have to do an action at that turn? \n\nBut we are at 9: we can only do D or S? Because U would go to 10 -> invalid.\n\nSo we must do S or D at the last action? But if we do D, then we go to 8? Then we are not at 9 at the next state? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me see the example: minimal path without obstacles: we start at y0 at turn78. We want to be at y9 at the start of turn78+H-1.\n\nTo be at y9 at the start of turn t, we must have been at y8 at the start of turn t-1 and then done U at turn t-1.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  turn78: start at y0 -> do U -> turn79: y1\n  ...\n  turn78+8: start at y8 -> do U -> turn78+9: y9\n\nBut then we are at y9 at the start of turn78+9.\n\nTherefore, to be at y9 at the start of turn78+9, we need to do 9 actions? from turn78 to turn78+8? \n\nBut the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1: \n   t1 = 78, H-1 = 8? so H=9? and we do actions at 78,79,...,86? and then at turn87 (which is 78+9) we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHere, t1+H-1 = 78+9-1 = 86? But at the start of turn86, we are at y8? Then we do an action at turn86 (the last action) and then at turn87 we are at y9.\n\nBut we require the state at the start of turn86 (t1+H-1) to be 9? That is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, if we set H=10: \n   then t1+H-1 = 78+10-1=87, and we require y_{87}=9.\n\nHow do we get y_{87}=9? \n   We must be at y8 at turn86 and do U at turn86 -> then at turn87: y9.\n\nSo then the sequence: \n   turn78: action (to get to y1 at turn79)\n   ...\n   turn86: action U (to get to y9 at turn87)\n\nSo the actions are from turn78 to turn86: 9 actions? Then H=9? But then t1+H-1=78+9-1=86, and we require y_{86}=9 -> but we are at y8 at the start of turn86.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. \n\nLooking at the problem: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nand we want to reach (0,9) at turn T = t1+H-1? \n\nBut the position is given at the start of the turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways ... at turn T\" meaning when we are on the freeway at the start of turn T? \n\nActually, the collision condition: \n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nand y_T is the y-coordinate at turn T? \n\nBut note: the update: \n  At the start of turn T, we are at (0, y_T). Then we choose an action, and then we move to y_{T+1}. \n\nSo during turn T, we are at y_T. Then the collision check is for freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo we require that at turn T, if y_T in [1,8] then the freeway y_T must be safe at turn T.\n\nNow, we want that at the end of the sequence, we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nThat is, at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nHow do we get to 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1?\n\nWe must have been at 8 at the start of turn t1+H-2 and done U at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo the last action that moves us to 9 is at turn t1+H-2.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and then we do an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9. \n\nThe problem requires a sequence of H actions. And we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, meaning that we are at 9 at the beginning of the turn when we are about to do the last action (the H-th action).\n\nBut then we do an action at turn t1+H-1: which must be S, U, or D. \n  If we do U: we go to 10 -> invalid.\n  If we do D: we go to 8 -> then we are not at 9 anymore.\n  If we do S: we stay at 9.\n\nSo we must do S at the last action? \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9, only that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo we can do S at turn t1+H-1 to remain at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sequence might not include that last action? But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nSo in the straight up path, we can do:\n\n  Actions: \n    turn78: U -> to y1 at turn79\n    turn79: U -> to y2 at turn80\n    ...\n    turn85: U -> to y7 at turn86\n    turn86: U -> to y8 at turn87\n    turn87: U -> to y9 at turn88\n\nBut then we are at y9 at turn88. We require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nAt the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? That would be if we are at 9 at turn87? Then we would have done an action at turn87 to get to y9 at turn88? But then at the start of turn87 we are at y8, not 9.\n\nWe want to be at 9 at the start of turn87: \n   turn87: start at y9 -> then we do an action.\n\nHow to achieve that?\n   We must be at y8 at turn86 and do U at turn86 -> then at turn87: y9.\n\nSo to be at y9 at turn87 (start), we do 8 moves: \n   turn78: U -> turn79: y1\n   ...\n   turn85: U -> turn86: y8\n   turn86: U -> turn87: y9\n\nThen at the start of turn87, we are at y9.\n\nTherefore, we need 8 actions? from turn78 to turn85? and then at turn86 we do the 8th action? \n\nBut then the sequence has 8 actions? and H=8? \n\nBut then t1+H-1 = 78+8-1 = 85? and we require y_{85}=9? \n   At the start of turn85, we are at y7 (because we did U at turn84 to get to y7 at turn85, and then at turn85 we do U to get to y8 at turn86).\n\nSo we are not at 9 at turn85.\n\nAlternatively, if we do 9 actions: \n   actions at turn78 to turn86: \n        turn78: U -> turn79: y1\n        turn79: U -> turn80: y2\n        turn80: U -> turn81: y3\n        turn81: U -> turn82: y4\n        turn82: U -> turn83: y5\n        turn83: U -> turn84: y6\n        turn84: U -> turn85: y7\n        turn85: U -> turn86: y8\n        turn86: U -> turn87: y9\n\nThen at the start of turn87, we are at y9? No, at the start of turn87, we are at y8? and then we do U at turn87 to get to y9 at turn88.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nIf H=9, then t1+H-1=78+9-1=86. So we require y_{86}=9.\n\nBut in the above, at the start of turn86, we are at y8.\n\nSo to have y_{86}=9, we must have been at y8 at turn85 and done U at turn85 -> then at turn86: y9.\n\nSo then the actions would be 8 actions: from turn78 to turn85? \n   turn78: U -> turn79: y1\n   turn79: U -> turn80: y2\n   turn80: U -> turn81: y3\n   turn81: U -> turn82: y4\n   turn82: U -> turn83: y5\n   turn83: U -> turn84: y6\n   turn84: U -> turn85: y7\n   turn85: U -> turn86: y9? \n\nBut that is 8 actions? then H=8.\n\nAnd then at turn86 (start) we are at y9.\n\nBut how did we get from y7 to y9 in one move? We can only move by 1.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only interpretation is that we require the state at the start of turn t1+H (after H actions) to be 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" but that must be a typo.\n\nBecause the update is:\n   y_{t1} = 0\n   after action at t1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δa_{t1}\n\n   after actions from t1 to t1+H-1: \n        y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum_{t=t1}^{t1+H-1} Δa_t\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the number of actions is H.\n\nThen we require: at the start of turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\nThen the minimal H is 9.\n\nAnd in our straight up path, we do 9 actions and at turn78+9=87, we are at 9.\n\nAnd the last state we are at a freeway is at turn86: at freeway8, which we checked is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n  turn78: U\n  turn79: U\n  turn80: U\n  turn81: U\n  turn82: U\n  turn83: U\n  turn84: U\n  turn85: U\n  turn86: U\n\nBut wait, at turn86 we are at y8 and do U to go to y9 at turn87.\n\nAnd we are at freeway8 at turn86 (dt=8) -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway8 is safe at dt=8? We computed: \n   freeway8: unsafe at dt=0 and dt=4 -> so dt=8 is safe.\n\nTherefore, it works.\n\nBut is there a problem at turn78? We are at y0 -> not a freeway -> safe.\nThen at turn79 (dt=1): freeway1 -> safe.\n... as above.\n\nBut what about freeway5,6,7 at dt=0? We are not on them at dt=0? We are at y0 at dt=0.\n\nWe only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found a path with H=9.\n\nBut is there a path with H<9? We must move up 9 times, so no.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n...\nTurn t_1 + 8: U   (since t1+8 = 78+8 = 86)\n\nBut the sequence has 9 actions: for t=0 to 8 (inclusive) -> 9 actions.\n\nThe actions are for turns: 78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\" etc.\n\nSo we start with Turn 78: U, then Turn 79: U, ... up to Turn 86: U.\n\nBut note: after the last action at turn86, we are at turn87 and we are at y9.\n\nAnd we require to reach (0,9) at some turn: which is turn87.\n\nAnd the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t=0 to 8 -> 9 actions.\n\nSo we have 9 lines.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision at freeway8 at turn86 (dt=8): \n   freeway8 has two cars:\n      car1: initial [-59,-48] -> at dt=8: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48]\n      car2: initial [-11,0] -> at dt=8: [-11+96, 0+96] = [85,96] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5,6,7 are safe for dt>=1, and we are on freeway5 at turn83 (dt=5): safe.\n\nBut what about freeway2,3,4 at dt=8? \n   We are on freeway2 at turn79 (dt=1) and then freeway3 at dt=2, freeway4 at dt=3: all safe because unsafe only at dt=8,9? \n   But at turn86 (dt=8) we are on freeway8, not freeway2,3,4.\n\nAnd freeway2,3,4: unsafe at dt=8 and 9, but we are not on them at those turns.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the 9 consecutive U moves.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 9. The sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 78\\) to turn \\(t_1 + 8 = 86\\) consists of moving up (U) at each turn. This path avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\):\n\n- At turn 78 (dt=0), the player is at \\(y=0\\) (not a freeway, safe).\n- At turn 79 (dt=1), \\(y=1\\) (freeway 1 is safe for all dt).\n- At turn 80 (dt=2), \\(y=2\\) (freeway 2 is unsafe only at dt=8,9; safe at dt=2).\n- At turn 81 (dt=3), \\(y=3\\) (freeway 3 is unsafe only at dt=8,9; safe at dt=3).\n- At turn 82 (dt=4), \\(y=4\\) (freeway 4 is unsafe only at dt=8,9; safe at dt=4).\n- At turn 83 (dt=5), \\(y=5\\) (freeway 5 is unsafe only at dt=0; safe at dt=5).\n- At turn 84 (dt=6), \\(y=6\\) (freeway 6 is unsafe only at dt=0; safe at dt=6).\n- At turn 85 (dt=7), \\(y=7\\) (freeway 7 is unsafe only at dt=0; safe at dt=7).\n- At turn 86 (dt=8), \\(y=8\\) (freeway 8 is unsafe at dt=0 and 4; safe at dt=8).\n- After the last action at turn 86, the player reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 87.\n\nThe car positions confirm no collision occurs at any step.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player starts at y=0, and I need to reach y=9. The vertical axis goes from 0 to 9, so y=9 is the top.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn. Moving up increases y by 1, down decreases by 1, stay keeps it the same, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions given at turn t_1=84. The cars move left or right at constant speed.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the positions it occupies.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose an action that determines y_{T+1}. If you move to a different y, at turn T you are still on y_T, so you only check for collisions on y_T at turn T. You don't check on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at t_1=84, and I need to find the sequence of actions starting from t_1=84.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at t_1=84.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, and head and tail are given, for right-moving, head > tail, I think? In the update, for right-moving, span is [tail, head]? Let me check.\n\nThe car update says:\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], then at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h], so τ should be the left end, h the right end. Similarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: at t_1, span [h, τ], which I think means from h to τ, and since it's left-moving, h decreases over time.\n\nIn the freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). Direction right, so for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ the left end, h right end. Here head=48, tail=37, so since direction right, τ=37, h=48, so span [37,48] at t_1=84.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). Direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, h is head, and for right, [τ, h] with τ left, h right. Here tail=-59, head=-48, so left end -59, right end -48, so span [-59, -48] at t_1=84.\n\nBut positions: the player is at x=0, so we care about when the car spans include x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-48,-59,right,6), so same span [-59,-48] at t_1=84.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 and 3, [-59,-48] at t_1=84.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: direction right, so span [τ,h] = [37,48] at t_1=84.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), so tail=-11, head=0, direction right, so span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t_1=84.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), so spans [37,48] and [-11,0] at t_1=84.\n\nFreeway 7: same, [37,48] and [-11,0] at t_1=84.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: tail=-59, head=-48, direction right, so span [-59,-48] at t_1=84.\n\nSecond car: tail=-11, head=0, direction right, so span [-11,0] at t_1=84.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway, when x=0 is covered by a car, i.e., when 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nThe player is on a freeway y at turn T only if y between 1 and 8. At y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. The player starts at (0,0), which is y=0, so at turn t_1=84, the player is at y=0, which is safe, no freeway. Then I need to move to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, it's safe.\n\nThe collision only matters when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1, so at time T = t_1 + Δt.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let's check directions.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: both right\n\n6: both right\n\n7: both right\n\n8: both right\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, 0 in span at T if τ + s (T - t_1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s (T - t_1)\n\nWhich is τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for Δt.\n\nThe inequality: τ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nWhich is s Δt ≤ -τ and -h ≤ s Δt? Let's write:\n\nFrom τ + s Δt ≤ 0: s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ / s  (since s>0)\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s Δt: -h ≤ s Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nAlso, since Δt must be integer, as turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so Δt integer.\n\nNow, τ and h are given, s speed.\n\nFor each car, we can find the range of Δt where 0 is in the span.\n\nBut for a given freeway, if there are multiple cars, we need if any car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their parameters.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: one car: τ=37, h=48, s=3\n\nSo condition for 0 in span:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\n37 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 3 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 37 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3 Δt ≤ -37 ⇒ Δt ≤ -37/3 ≈ -12.333, so Δt ≤ -13 since integer? Δt ≤ floor(-12.333) but Δt is T - t_1, T ≥ t_1, so Δt ≥ 0, I think we start from Δt=0.\n\nΔt = T - t_1, T is turn, t_1=84, T ≥ t_1, so Δt ≥ 0.\n\nNow, 37 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3 Δt ≤ -37, which is impossible for Δt ≥ 0 since left side ≥0? 37 + 3 Δt ≥37 >0, so 37 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 is never true for Δt ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ 48 + 3 Δt is always true for Δt ≥0.\n\nSo the first inequality never holds, so 0 is never in the span for this car? But let's see.\n\nThe condition is τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nτ + s Δt = 37 + 3 Δt, which for Δt≥0 is at least 37 >0, so 37 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 is false, so the inequality cannot hold. So indeed, for all T ≥ t_1, 0 is not in the span for this car on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, h + s Δt =48 + 3 Δt >0, but the lower bound is positive, so 0 is less than lower bound, so not in [lower, upper].\n\nSo freeway y=1 is always safe? No car covers x=0 for any T≥84.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAt Δt=0, span [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nAs Δt increases, the car moves right, so span shifts right, [37 + 3Δt, 48 + 3Δt], all positions positive and increasing, so 0 is always left of the car, never covered. So yes, freeway 1 is safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 6 Δt, -48 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-59 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 Δt ≤ 59 ⇒ Δt ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so Δt ≤ 9 since integer\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 6 Δt ⇒ 48 ≤ 6 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 48/6 = 8\n\nSo Δt ≥ 8 and Δt ≤ 9\n\nSo for Δt=8 and 9, 0 is in span.\n\nAt Δt=8: lower = -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nUpper = -48 + 48 = 0? -48 + 48 =0\n\nSo span [-11, 0] at T= t_1 +8\n\n0 is included, since ≤ upper.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=9: lower = -59 + 54 = -5? -59 + 54 = -5\n\nUpper = -48 + 54 = 6\n\nSpan [-5,6], so 0 is in.\n\nAt Δt=10: lower=-59+60=1, upper=-48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at T= t_1 +8 and t_1 +9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car parameters, so collision at same times: T=84+8=92 and 84+9=93.\n\nt_1=84, so T=92 and 93.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same, collision at T=92 and 93.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) but direction right, τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt\n\n37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ -37 ⇒ Δt ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, impossible for Δt≥0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt always true.\n\nSo never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 12 Δt is true for Δt ≥0, since 12Δt ≥0.\n\nAnd -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so for Δt=0 only? Δt integer, so Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, lower = -11 +0 = -11, upper=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=1, lower=-11+12=1, upper=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, which is T=t_1=84, the car covers x=0.\n\nBut at turn T, if the player is on freeway 5 at T=84, then collision.\n\nBut the player is at y=0 at t_1=84, not on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 is y=5, I think.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so at turn T=84, if player is on y=5, then collision with this car.\n\nBut player starts at y=0, so not on freeway 5 at T=84.\n\nNow, for future turns.\n\nAt Δt=0, only if player is there at T=84.\n\nFor Δt>0, no cover, so freeway 5 is safe except at T=84, but since player not there, it's safe for other times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, two cars: first [37+12Δt,48+12Δt] never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12Δt,12Δt], covers 0 only at Δt=0.\n\nSo same as above.\n\nFreeway 7: same, covers 0 only at Δt=0.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 59 ⇒ Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt ≤4\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 +12 Δt ⇒ 48 ≤ 12 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 48/12 =4\n\nSo Δt ≥4 and Δt ≤4, so only at Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, lower=-59+48=-11, upper=-48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) same as before, τ=-11, h=0, s=12, covers 0 only at Δt=0.\n\nSo for freeway 8, collision at T= t_1 +0 =84 (from second car) and T= t_1 +4=88 (from first car).\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times (when 0 covered):\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=92,93\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=92,93\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=92,93\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at T=84 (but player not there at start, so effectively safe if not at T=84)\n\nAt T=84, unsafe if on y=5, but player at y=0, so for moving to y=5 later, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: same, unsafe only at T=84\n\ny=7: same, unsafe only at T=84\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=84 and T=88\n\nNow, player starts at (0,0) at t=84.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) with minimal turns.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut since I need to avoid freeways when they are unsafe, I might need to time my moves.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, player is at y_T, and after action, y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T when on freeway y_T.\n\nIf y_T between 1 and 8, and at that T, 0 is covered on that freeway, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, I need a sequence of actions from t=84 onwards.\n\nLet t be absolute turn, starting from t=84.\n\nAt t=84, y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action for t=84, which determines y at t=85.\n\nThen at t=85, y_{85}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t + H -1} =9 for some H.\n\nSince I start at t=84, after H turns, I am at turn t=84 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nTurn indices: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nSequence from t=84 to t=84 + H -1, and at turn 84 + H -1, y=9.\n\nThe actions are for t=84 to t=84 + H -1, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y at turn 84 + H.\n\nSet t=84 as time zero.\n\nLet k be the step, from k=0 to k=H.\n\nAt time T = 84 + k, y_{84+k}\n\nAfter action, y_{84+k+1}\n\nAt turn T=84+k, if y_{84+k} in {1,2,...,8}, check if unsafe at that T.\n\nI need y_{84 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9.\n\nSuppose at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT must be >=84.\n\nAt T=84, y=0, not 9.\n\nI need to arrive at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=84 to t=84 + H -1, so after H actions, I have moved H steps, and y_{84 + H} is the position after H actions.\n\nAt turn t=84, I am at y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{84}, I go to y_{85} = y_{84} + delta y.\n\nAfter a_{85}, y_{86}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t=84 + H, position y_{84+H}.\n\nI need y_{84+H} =9.\n\nThe last action is at t=84 + H -1, which sets y_{84+H}.\n\nFor example, with H=0, not possible.\n\nMinimal H to reach y=9 from y=0.\n\nSince each move changes y by at most 1, min H is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I may need to avoid unsafe times.\n\ny_{84+H} =9.\n\nThe turns when I am on freeways must be safe.\n\nNow, list the unsafe times for each y.\n\nFirst, y=1: always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=92 and 93 (which is k=8 and 9, since T=84+k, so k=8: T=92, k=9: T=93)\n\nT=84 + k, so for k, T=84+k.\n\nUnsafe for y=2 at k=8 and 9.\n\nSimilarly y=3: same, unsafe at k=8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe at k=8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe only at k=0 (T=84), but at k=0, if on y=5, but at k=0, y=0, so for k>0, safe. Since unsafe only at T=84, and player not on y=5 at T=84, so y=5 is safe for all times except possibly if I were there at start, but I'm not, so effectively always safe for the player.\n\nSimilarly y=6: always safe except at k=0, but not issue.\n\ny=7: always safe except at k=0.\n\ny=8: unsafe at k=0 (T=84) and k=4 (T=88)\n\nNow, y=8 unsafe at k=4.\n\nk=4: T=84+4=88.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at k=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8.\n\nSince y=1,5,6,7 are always safe or effectively safe, y=2,3,4 unsafe only at k=8,9, y=8 unsafe at k=4.\n\nI need to be on each y at some point, but I can skip some if I move directly, but I have to go through each integer y, since I can only change by 1 each step.\n\nThe player moves step by step, so y changes by at most 1 each turn, so I must pass through every integer y from 0 to 9 in sequence.\n\nFor example, to go from 0 to 9, I must be at each y from 0 to 9 at some point, and the sequence is increasing or with stays or down, but since I need to reach 9, and min steps, probably I go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a bad y at bad time.\n\nIn this case, since y=0 and y=9 are safe, and I start at y=0.\n\nNow, the critical points are:\n\n- If I am on y=8 at k=4 (turn 88), collision.\n\n- If I am on y=2,3, or 4 at k=8 or 9 (turn 92 or 93), collision.\n\nNow, k is the time index from start.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some k.\n\nLet me denote the time when I am at each y.\n\nSince I move step by step, let t_y be the turn when I first reach y, or when I am at y.\n\nBut I might visit y multiple times, but to minimize time, probably I go up directly, so I might not revisit.\n\nAssume I only move up, with possible stays, but no down, since down would take more steps to reach 9.\n\nMoving down would increase H, so for min H, I should not move down, only up or stay.\n\nBut staying might be necessary to avoid bad times.\n\nMoving down might be necessary if stuck, but let's see if possible with only up and stay.\n\nSo actions U or S, no D.\n\nThen y is non-decreasing.\n\nStart y=0 at t=84.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some t.\n\nThe time to reach y=9: since min 9 steps up, so if I do U every turn, I reach y=9 at t=93.\n\nt=84, y=0\n\nt=85, y=1 (after U)\n\nt=86, y=2\n\n...\n\nt=93, y=9\n\nNow, check if any collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn, when on freeway, check if unsafe.\n\nt=84: y=0, safe, not freeway.\n\nt=85: y=1, freeway, but y=1 always safe, so ok.\n\nt=86: y=2, freeway. Now y=2 unsafe at t=92 and 93.\n\nt=86 is k=2? t=84 + k, k=0: t=84, y=0\n\nk=1: t=85, y=1\n\nk=2: t=86, y=2\n\n...\n\nk=9: t=93, y=9\n\ny=2 at k=2, t=86.\n\nUnsafe times for y=2 are k=8 and 9, t=92,93.\n\nAt k=2, t=86, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=87: y=3, at k=3, t=87. Unsafe for y=3 at k=8,9, not now, safe.\n\nt=88: y=4, k=4, t=88. Unsafe for y=4 at k=8,9, not now, safe.\n\nt=89: y=5, k=5, t=89. y=5 safe, as only unsafe at k=0, not here.\n\nt=90: y=6, k=6, t=90. Safe.\n\nt=91: y=7, k=7, t=91. Safe.\n\nt=92: y=8, k=8, t=92. Now y=8 unsafe at k=0 and k=4.\n\nk=0 is t=84, k=4 is t=88.\n\nAt k=8, t=92, is it unsafe?\n\ny=8 unsafe at k=4 and k=0, but k=8 not listed, so should be safe?\n\nEarlier: y=8 unsafe at T=84 and T=88.\n\nT=84 is k=0, T=88 is k=4.\n\nAt T=92, k=8, is it unsafe?\n\nFor y=8, cars: at T=92, Δt = T - t_1 = 92 - 84 =8\n\nFirst car: span [-59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59 +96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11 +12*8, 0 +12*8] = [-11+96, 96] = [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, t=93: y=9, safe, not freeway.\n\nIn this path, at t=92, y=8, which is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=2,3,4 unsafe at k=8,9, but in this path, at k=8, t=92, y=8, not y=2,3,4.\n\nAt k=8, y=8, which is safe.\n\nAt k=9, y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this direct up path, all safe? But at t=92, y=8, safe, and t=93 y=9.\n\nBut what about y=2,3,4 at earlier times.\n\nFor example, at t=86, y=2, k=2, not unsafe time.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut y=8 at t=88: in this path, at t=88, what y?\n\nt=88 is k=4, t=88.\n\nIn the sequence: t=84 y=0\n\nt=85 y=1\n\nt=86 y=2\n\nt=87 y=3\n\nt=88 y=4\n\nt=89 y=5\n\n...\n\nAt t=88, k=4, y=4.\n\nNow y=4 is unsafe at k=8 and 9, not at k=4.\n\nk=4 is t=88, not unsafe for y=4.\n\nUnsafe for y=4 at k=8,9.\n\nAt k=4, y=4, is it safe?\n\ny=4 freeway, unsafe times: from earlier, y=4 unsafe at T=92 and 93, which is k=8 and 9.\n\nAt k=4, T=88, should be safe.\n\nCheck: for freeway 4, car at t_1: span [-59,-48] right speed 6.\n\nAt T=88, Δt=4, span [-59 +6*4, -48 +6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], which does not contain 0, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this path, no collision, and I reach y=9 at t=93 with 9 up moves.\n\nH=9 turns? From t=84 to t=92, actions at t=84 to 92, 9 actions, reach y at t=93=9.\n\nt=93 is turn 93, y=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=84 to t=92.\n\nBut the answer should be actions starting from t_1=84.\n\nIn this case, all U.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\ny=8 at t=92: we checked safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=8 unsafe at k=4, but in this path at k=4, I am at y=4, not y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster? Min H=9, since 9 steps up.\n\nBut if I start at y=0, after one up, y=1, and so on, after 9 ups, y=9.\n\nCan I reach in less than 9? No, because each action changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 actions.\n\nSo H=9 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nTurn t=84: action U, to y=1 at t=85.\n\nAt t=85, y=1, which is safe.\n\nTurn t=85: U, to y=2 at t=86.\n\nAt t=86, y=2, which is freeway 2, at time t=86.\n\nt=86, Δt=2 from t_1=84.\n\nFor freeway 2: car span at T=86: Δt=2, span [-59 +6*2, -48 +6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=87: y=3, freeway 3, same as above, span [-47,-36] for the car, since same parameters, 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=88: y=4, freeway 4, same, span [-35,-24]? Δt=4, T=88, Δt=4, span [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nt=89: y=5, freeway 5. Cars: first car span [37+12*5,48+12*5]? Δt=5, T=89, t_1=84, Δt=5.\n\nFirst car: [37 +12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11 +12*5, 0 +12*5] = [-11+60, 60]=[49,60], no 0. Safe.\n\nt=90: y=6, similar, safe.\n\nt=91: y=7, safe.\n\nt=92: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCars: first car, τ=-59, h=-48, s=12, Δt=8, span [-59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96]=[37,48], no 0.\n\nSecond car: τ=-11, h=0, s=12, span [-11+96, 96]=[85,96], no 0. Safe.\n\nt=93: y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the task is to reach (0,9), and I do at t=93.\n\nWith actions: at t=84: U, t=85: U, ..., up to t=92: U. That's 9 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=84 to t=92 for actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list actions for turns starting from t_1=84.\n\nSo for H=9, actions: Turn 84: U, Turn 85: U, ..., Turn 92: U.\n\nThen at Turn 93, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence should be up to when? The actions from t=84 to t=84+H-1, here H=9, so t=84 to 92, 9 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9 is minimal, and it works.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=9.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with stays or something, but H=9 is min.\n\nPerhaps start with stay, but that would make H larger.\n\nNo.\n\nBut in freeway 5,6,7 at t=84, they have a car covering 0, but since player not there, no issue.\n\nIn this path, I pass through y=5 at t=89, which is fine.\n\nAnother thing: at y=8, unsafe at t=88, but in this path I am at y=4 at t=88, not y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player update: when I move, for example, at turn T, I am at y_T, I choose action, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n\nAnd collision only at T on y_T.\n\nIn this case, all covered.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 at t=88.\n\nAt t=88, if someone is on y=8, unsafe.\n\nBut in min path, I am not.\n\nPerhaps for other paths.\n\nBut since min H=9 is achievable, no need.\n\nBut let me confirm if y=2,3,4 at k=8 or 9 unsafe.\n\nIn min path, at k=8, t=92, I am at y=8, not y=2,3,4.\n\nAt k=9, y=9.\n\nSo not on y=2,3,4 at that time.\n\nIf I were to stay somewhere, I might be on them at bad time, but I don't.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=84 to t=92.\n\nt=84 to t=92 inclusive? 9 turns: 84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92.\n\nAfter a_{92}, y_{93}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the answer, list each turn and action.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere t_1=84, H=9, so t from 0 to 8, so actions at t=84+0=84 to t=84+8=92.\n\nYes.\n\nAll actions U.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nBut the box should contain:\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 92: U\n\nBut since all same, perhaps I can write, but better to list.\n\nIn text.\n\nSince it's a sequence.\n\nBut in the format, it says to list each turn.\n\nNow, but I think that's it.\n\nBut is there a mistake?\n\nAnother point: the player position at start is (0,0), and I move up.\n\nBut at turn t=84, I am at (0,0), I choose action U, then at t=85, I am at (0,1), and so on.\n\nIn the car update, for freeways, when I am on y=1 at t=85, which is freeway 1, and we saw it's always safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at any point I am on a freeway when 0 covered.\n\nFor example, at t=92, y=8, we have span not covering 0.\n\nBut let me list all positions:\n\nTurn | y | Freeway? | Unsafe? | Check\n\n84 | 0 | no | safe\n\n85 | 1 | yes | y1 always safe | span: for y1 at t=85, Δt=1, [37+3*1, 48+3*1]=[40,51], no 0\n\n86 | 2 | yes | not unsafe time | y2 car: [-59+6*2, -48+6*2]=[-47,-36], no 0\n\n87 | 3 | yes | similar, [-47,-36] for y3? Freeway 3 has same car, so same span.\n\n88 | 4 | yes | [-59+6*4, -48+6*4] for y4? Δt=4, T=88, [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], no 0\n\n89 | 5 | yes | y5: first car [37+12*5,48+12*5]=[97,108]? Δt=5, [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], second car [-11+60,60]=[49,60], no 0\n\n90 | 6 | yes | similar, same as y5 since same cars? Freeway 6 has same cars as 5? In the state, freeway 5,6,7 all have same cars? Freeway 5: cars (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, so at t=90, Δt=6, first car [37+72,48+72]=[109,120], second car [-11+72,72]=[61,72], no 0\n\n91 | 7 | yes | same, Δt=7, [37+84,48+84]=[121,132], second [-11+84,84]=[73,84], no 0\n\n92 | 8 | yes | freeway 8: cars (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)? First car: τ=-59,h=-48,s=12, Δt=8, [-59+96, -48+96]=[37,48], second car τ=-11,h=0,s=12, [-11+96,96]=[85,96], no 0\n\n93 | 9 | no | safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo the sequence is all U.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9, actions all U from t=84 to 92.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nSequence: a_{84} to a_{92} all U.\n\nNow, write in box.\n\nBut since all U, I can write concisely, but probably list each turn.\n\nIn the format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in text, since it's a box.\n\nPerhaps I can write the sequence.\n\nBut I think this is fine.\n\nIs there a way with H=8? That would require moving faster, but I can only change by 1 each step, so from y=0 to y=9 in 8 moves impossible, since min 9 moves.\n\nFor example, after 8 moves, y<=8, so not 9.\n\nSo H=9 is indeed min.\n\nThus, this should be the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car that covers at t=88, but I am not there.\n\nPerhaps if I go slower, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo min is 9.\n\nI think correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 84\\) is 9, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t = 84\\) to \\(t = 92\\).\n\n- At turn 84, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\) and moves up to \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 85.\n- At turn 85, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\) and moves up to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 86.\n- This pattern continues, with the player moving up each turn, reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 93.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) because:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 5, 6, 7\\) are safe at all times except \\(t = 84\\) for \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\), but the player is not on these freeways at \\(t = 84\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe only at \\(t = 92\\) and \\(t = 93\\), but the player is on \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 92\\) and \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 93\\), not on \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at \\(t = 84\\) and \\(t = 88\\), but the player is on \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 84\\) and \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 88\\), not on \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThus, all positions during the sequence are safe, and \\(y = 9\\) is reached in 9 turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 through y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 90, and I start at y=0. The goal is to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)], and for left-moving, it's [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)]. But all the cars here are right-moving, according to the table. Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3) — that's right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6) — right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, 3,4 same as 2.\n\nFreeway 5: (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12) — two cars, both right.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12) — both right.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving, so the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] for each car.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, meaning y_T = k for some k from 1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T you are at y_T, and you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are only on y_T, not on y_{T+1}. And at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSpan(T) is for time T, which is the turn.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, for each turn T when you are on a freeway k, 0 must not be in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t₁=90. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars to worry about there. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H means the number of actions taken. Since I start at turn t₁, after H actions, I will be at turn t₁ + H, and position after H actions is y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nLet's define the turns carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, the player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe position is updated after the action.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T: when y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 in span of car on freeway k at time T.\n\nTime T is the turn number.\n\nNow, at turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nIf y_T = k, then we check if 0 is in any car's span on freeway k at time T.\n\nIf not, safe; if yes, collision.\n\nNow, for the action sequence: actions from a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H-1}, so H actions, and after H actions, y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nSince I start at y_{t₁} = 0, and after H actions, y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nThe number of moves to go from y=0 to y=9 with U, D, S actions. Since S keeps you in place, and U and D change by +1 or -1, the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9, all U moves.\n\nBut there are obstacles on freeways, so I need to avoid being on a freeway when 0 is in a car's span.\n\nAlso, I can use D to go down, but since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, going down might not help, but I can stay or go down to avoid collision, but it might take more turns.\n\nI need to minimize H, so probably I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the times when cars are at position 0.\n\nNow, let's list all the freeways and their cars.\n\nFirst, for each freeway k, I have the cars at time t₁=90.\n\nThen for any future time T, I can compute the span for each car.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at time T: [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nBut h and τ are given, and for right-moving, if h > τ, then span is [τ, h], I think? Let me see the notation.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nNow, at t₁, for a car, the span is given as (h, τ) at t₁.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: at t₁, head 48, tail 37, right, speed 3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, and head=48, tail=37, so head > tail, so span at t₁ is [37, 48]? But in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span at t₁ should be [τ, h] if τ < h.\n\nIn freeway 1: h=48, τ=37, so τ < h, so span at t₁ is [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: h=-48, τ=-59, so τ = -59, h=-48, since -59 < -48, so span at t₁ is [-59, -48].\n\nIn general, for right-moving, since span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], and at T=t₁, it should be [τ, h], so we must have τ ≤ h, which is the case for all cars here.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: τ=37, h=48, 37<48.\n\nFreeway 2: τ=-59, h=-48, -59<-48.\n\nFreeway 5: first car (48,37,right,12), τ=37,h=48; second car (0,-11,right,12), τ=-11,h=0, -11<0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12), τ=-59,h=-48; and (0,-11,right,12), τ=-11,h=0.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at time T if y_T = k and 0 is in the span of some car on k at time T.\n\nThat is, for some car, τ + s(T - t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t₁)\n\nSince the span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] for right-moving.\n\nNow, t₁ = 90.\n\nSo let me define Δt = T - t₁, so for time T, Δt = T - 90.\n\nThen for a car with τ, h, s, the span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], which means τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSince τ ≤ h, this is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt, but since τ ≤ h, it's one inequality: min(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt), but since s Δt is scalar, and τ ≤ h, τ + s Δt ≤ h + s Δt, so the interval is [lower, upper] with lower = τ + s Δt, upper = h + s Δt.\n\nSo 0 in [lower, upper] iff lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is dangerous, i.e., when there is a car such that lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars on a freeway, I need to find for each k, the set of Δt where for some car on k, τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nThen, to be safe on freeway k at time T, we need that for all cars on k, 0 is not in the span, so for each car, either 0 < τ + s Δt or h + s Δt < 0.\n\nBut it's easier to find the dangerous times.\n\nSince I need to go through each freeway from y=1 to y=8, but I can stay or move down, so I might not go through all, or I might skip some.\n\nFor example, I could go from y=0 to y=1 at some turn, then stay on y=1 for some turns, then to y=2, etc., or I could move up multiple steps, but since each action changes y by at most 1, I have to go through each y sequentially, but I can skip y by moving directly, but no, each action only changes y by 0 or ±1, so to go from y to y+1, I need an U action, and similarly, I have to pass through each integer y.\n\nThe position is discrete, y from 0 to 9, and each action changes y by -1, 0, or +1, so to go from 0 to 9, I must pass through each y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some point, but not necessarily on the same turn; I can be on a freeway for multiple turns if I stay.\n\nFor each freeway k, when I am on it, which is when y_t = k for some t, I need that at that time t, it is safe, i.e., no car on k has 0 in its span at time t.\n\nNow, since I want to minimize the number of turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I may need to wait on some safe y or on non-freeway points.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSo I can stay on y=0 or y=9 without problem, but since I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, staying on y=0 doesn't help, except to wait for a better time.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay on freeways if they are safe, but freeways have cars, so if I stay on a freeway, I need it to be safe for that turn.\n\nBut I might stay to avoid moving to a dangerous freeway.\n\nNow, to find the minimal H, I need to find a path with actions that avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the times when it is dangerous, i.e., the set of Δt where there exists a car on k such that τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSince Δt is integer, as turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = T - 90, so for T ≥ 90.\n\nNow, for each k, let's list the cars and find for which Δt the inequality holds.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: τ=37, h=48, s=3\n\nSo lower = 37 + 3 Δt, upper = 48 + 3 Δt\n\n0 in [37 + 3 Δt, 48 + 3 Δt] iff 37 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 3 Δt\n\nSolve:\n\n37 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ -37 => Δt ≤ -37/3 ≈ -12.333, so Δt ≤ -13 since integer\n\nand 0 ≤ 48 + 3 Δt => 48 + 3 Δt ≥ 0 => 3 Δt ≥ -48 => Δt ≥ -16\n\nSo Δt ≥ -16 and Δt ≤ -13\n\nBut Δt = T - 90, and T ≥ 90, so Δt ≥ 0\n\nΔt ≥ 0, but -16 and -13 are negative, so for Δt ≥ 0, 37 + 3 Δt ≥ 37 >0, so lower >0, so 0 < lower, so 0 not in [lower, upper] since lower >0.\n\nThus, for freeway 1, for all Δt ≥ 0, it is safe, because the car is at position around 40, moving right, so it will never be near 0 since s=3, it's moving away or staying away.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: one car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nlower = -59 + 6 Δt, upper = -48 + 6 Δt\n\n0 in [ -59 + 6 Δt, -48 + 6 Δt ] iff -59 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6 Δt\n\nSo -59 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 => 6 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so Δt ≤ 9\n\nand 0 ≤ -48 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 8\n\nSo for Δt = 8,9\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since car is identical: (-48,-59,right,6) so same as above, dangerous at Δt=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, dangerous at Δt=8,9\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nlower = 37 + 12 Δt, upper = 48 + 12 Δt\n\nSince s=12, high speed.\n\n37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0? 12 Δt ≤ -37, Δt ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, Δt ≤ -4? But Δt ≥0, so 37 + 12 Δt ≥37>0, so always lower >0, so 0 not in span for first car.\n\nSecond car: τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nlower = -11 + 12 Δt, upper = 0 + 12 Δt = 12 Δt\n\n0 in [ -11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt ] iff -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 12 Δt always true for Δt ≥0 since 12 Δt ≥0.\n\nSecond, -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so Δt ≤ 0 since integer Δt.\n\nΔt ≤ 0.916, so for Δt=0, it is true; for Δt≥1, false.\n\nNow, at Δt=0, -11 + 12*0 = -11 ≤0, and 0 ≤ 0, so 0 is in [-11,0]? Upper is h + s Δt = 0 + 12*0 =0, lower τ + s Δt = -11 +0 = -11, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, since ≤.\n\nCollision if 0 in the span, and since it's a closed interval, 0 is included if it equals the endpoint.\n\nIn the inequality, 0 ≤ h + s Δt, which at Δt=0 is 0 ≤ 0, true, and τ + s Δt ≤0, -11≤0 true, so yes, at Δt=0, for freeway 5, second car, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nFor Δt=1, lower = -11 +12=1, upper=12, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFor Δt=0 only.\n\nBut Δt=0 corresponds to T=90.\n\nNow, at T=90, if I am on freeway 5, it would be dangerous, but at t=90, I am at y=0, not on freeway 5.\n\nBut for future times.\n\nFor freeway 5, dangerous only at Δt=0 for the second car.\n\nBut Δt=0 is only at T=90, so for T>90, Δt≥1, it is safe, because first car never near 0, second car at Δt≥1, lower = -11 +12 Δt ≥ -11+12=1>0, so [1,12 Δt] all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only dangerous at T=90.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5, so same, dangerous only at T=90.\n\nFreeway 7: same, dangerous only at T=90.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nlower = -59 + 12 Δt, upper = -48 + 12 Δt\n\nSecond car: τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nlower = -11 + 12 Δt, upper = 12 Δt\n\nNow, for first car: 0 in [ -59 +12 Δt, -48 +12 Δt ] iff -59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12 Δt\n\nSo -59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916, so Δt ≤4\n\nand 0 ≤ -48 +12 Δt => 12 Δt ≥48 => Δt ≥4\n\nSo for Δt=4\n\nAt Δt=4, lower = -59 + 48 = -11, upper = -48 +48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nFor second car: 0 in [ -11 +12 Δt, 12 Δt ] iff -11 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nAs before, 0 ≤ 12 Δt always for Δt≥0, and -11 +12 Δt ≤0 => 12 Δt ≤11 => Δt ≤ 11/12 <1, so only Δt=0\n\nAt Δt=0, [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nSo for freeway 8, dangerous when either car has 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=0: second car dangerous.\n\nAt Δt=4: first car dangerous.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway the dangerous times Δt (relative to t₁=90, so T=90 + Δt)\n\nFreeway 1: always safe for Δt≥0\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at Δt=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous at Δt=8,9 (same as 2)\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at Δt=8,9 (same)\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous only at Δt=0 (T=90)\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous only at Δt=0\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous only at Δt=0\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at Δt=0 and Δt=4\n\nΔt=0 is T=90, which is now.\n\nSince I start at t=90, y=0, I need to take actions from a_{90} onwards.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways I need to worry about are when I am on them at some turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0, I can take actions to move up.\n\nThe dangerous times:\n\n- For freeways 5,6,7,8: they are dangerous only at T=90 or specific times, but T=90 is now, and I am at y=0, so when I move to y=1, it will be at a later turn.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=90 onwards.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn after H actions.\n\nSince I want minimal H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway at dangerous times.\n\nThe dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nk=1: always safe\n\nk=2: dangerous at T=98 and T=99 (since Δt=8,9: T=90+8=98, T=99)\n\nk=3: same, dangerous at T=98,99\n\nk=4: same, dangerous at T=98,99\n\nk=5: dangerous only at T=90\n\nk=6: dangerous only at T=90\n\nk=7: dangerous only at T=90\n\nk=8: dangerous at T=90 and T=94 (Δt=0 and 4, T=90+4=94)\n\nT=90 is the current turn.\n\nAt T=90, I am at y=0, so I am not on any freeway, so no collision.\n\nI take action a_{90}, which affects y_{91}.\n\nThen at turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor example, at T=90, y=0, safe.\n\nThen after action, y_{91} = y_{90} + Δy_{90}\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are the lower freeways at early times and higher at later, but times overlap.\n\nSince k=5,6,7 are dangerous only at T=90, which is past, so for T>90, they are always safe.\n\nSimilarly, k=1 always safe.\n\nk=8 dangerous at T=94.\n\nk=2,3,4 dangerous at T=98,99.\n\nk=8 also dangerous at T=90, but T=90 done.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should move up quickly through the lower freeways since they are safer now.\n\nBut let's think about when I can be on each freeway.\n\nFirst, I need to pass through y=1 to y=8.\n\nI can do this in different orders, but since I start at 0 and go to 9, I should go up.\n\nBut I might stay or move down to avoid, but moving down might not help since I need to go up eventually.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, I might need to wait.\n\nSince k=5,6,7 are safe for all T>90, I can be on them anytime except T=90, which is fine.\n\nk=1 always safe.\n\nk=8 safe except T=94.\n\nk=2,3,4 safe except T=98,99.\n\nNow, T=94 is earlier than T=98.\n\nI need to be on each freeway at some turn when it is safe.\n\nFor y=1: always safe, so I can be on it anytime.\n\ny=2: dangerous only at T=98,99, so safe for T≤97 or T≥100.\n\nSimilarly y=3: same, safe except T=98,99.\n\ny=4: same.\n\ny=5: safe for all T except T=90, but T=90 is past, so all T>90 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7 safe all time except T=90, so all T>90 safe.\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=94, so safe for T≠94, i.e., T≤93 or T≥95.\n\nNow, I need to assign for each y from 1 to 8, a turn when I am on it, and it is safe.\n\nBut I might be on a freeway for multiple turns if I stay, but to minimize turns, I probably don't want to stay, just move through.\n\nSince moving up takes at least one turn per level, minimal is to go up each turn, but I might need to stay or skip if possible, but I can't skip levels.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, so to go from 0 to 9, I need exactly 9 U actions, and I can have S or D actions which increase time but not position, so to minimize H, which is the number of actions, I should avoid S or D, and use only U, but if I use S or D, H increases, so y increases slower, so it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0, after H actions, y_{t1 + H} = y_{90 + H} = initial y + sum of Δy from t=90 to 90+H-1.\n\ny_{90} = 0\n\nAfter first action a_{90}, y_{91} = 0 + Δy_{90}\n\nAfter second action a_{91}, y_{92} = y_{91} + Δy_{91}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, y_{90 + H} = sum_{t=90}^{90+H-1} Δy_t\n\nAnd I need y_{90+H} = 9.\n\nEach Δy_t is -1,0,1, so the sum is at most H, and to reach 9, I need the sum to be 9, so I need at least 9 U actions, and any S or D action adds to H without contributing to the sum, so H must be at least 9, and H=9 only if all actions are U.\n\nIf I use S or D, H >9.\n\nTo minimize H, I should try to use only U actions, so H=9, and reach y=9 at turn 90+9=99.\n\nNow, I need to check if it is possible to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns with all U actions, without colliding.\n\nThat means, at each turn T from 90 to 98, I will be at y_{T} = T - 90? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 90: y=0\n\nAfter a_{90}=U, y_{91} = 0 +1 =1\n\nAfter a_{91}=U, y_{92} =1 +1 =2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{98}=U, y_{99} =8 +1 =9\n\nNow, at which turns am I on which freeway?\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor T=90: y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nT=91: y=1, on freeway 1\n\nT=92: y=2, on freeway 2\n\nT=93: y=3, on freeway 3\n\nT=94: y=4, on freeway 4\n\nT=95: y=5, on freeway 5\n\nT=96: y=6, on freeway 6\n\nT=97: y=7, on freeway 7\n\nT=98: y=8, on freeway 8\n\nT=99: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, I need to check for each of these, if on freeway, no collision.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=91: Δt = T - 90 = 91-90=1\n\nFreeway 1: always safe, as we saw, so safe.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=92: Δt=92-90=2\n\nFreeway 2 dangerous at Δt=8,9, which is T=98,99. Δt=2 not 8 or 9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 at T=93: Δt=3, not 8 or 9, safe.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=94: Δt=4, not 8 or 9, safe. Freeway 4 dangerous at Δt=8,9, yes.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=95: Δt=5\n\nFreeway 5 dangerous only at Δt=0, which is past, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at T=96: Δt=6, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=97: Δt=7, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=98: Δt=98-90=8\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at Δt=0 and Δt=4.\n\nΔt=8, not 0 or 4, so should be safe?\n\nΔt=8, let's check.\n\nAt Δt=8, for freeway 8:\n\nFirst car: lower = -59 + 12*8 = -59 + 96 = 37, upper = -48 + 96 = 48, so [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: lower = -11 + 12*8 = -11 + 96 = 85, upper=96, [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAnd at T=99, y=9, safe.\n\nSo, in this path, all positions are safe with all U actions.\n\nIs that right?\n\nT=94: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at Δt=8,9? Freeway 4 has the same car as freeway 2,3: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nAt Δt=4, T=94.\n\nlower = -59 + 6*4 = -59 + 24 = -35\n\nupper = -48 + 24 = -24\n\nSo [ -35, -24], 0 not in, since both negative.\n\nDangerous only at Δt=8,9: at Δt=8, lower=-59+48= -11, upper=-48+48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=9, lower=-59+54= -5, upper=-48+54=6, [ -5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut at Δt=4, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8 at T=98, Δt=8, as above, safe.\n\nAnd T=95,96,97 on 5,6,7, all safe since not T=90.\n\nSo yes, with all U actions, I can go directly to y=9 in 9 turns, no collision.\n\nBut the player position: at turn T, after the action, y_{T} is for that turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 90: action U, then y_{91} =1\n\nBut at turn 90, before action, y=0, after action U, y becomes 1 at turn 91.\n\nThe collision check is at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt turn 90: y=0, not freeway.\n\nAfter action a_{90}, which is U, y_{91}=1.\n\nAt turn 91: y=1, on freeway 1, and we need to check if safe at turn 91.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{91}=U, y_{92}=2, at turn 92, y=2, on freeway 2, check safe, and so on.\n\nIn the above, all are safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=91: y=1, freeway 1, Δt=1, safe\n\nT=92: y=2, freeway 2, Δt=2, safe (not 8 or 9)\n\nT=93: y=3, freeway 3, Δt=3, safe\n\nT=94: y=4, freeway 4, Δt=4, safe (not 8 or 9)\n\nT=95: y=5, freeway 5, Δt=5, safe (not 0)\n\nT=96: y=6, freeway 6, Δt=6, safe\n\nT=97: y=7, freeway 7, Δt=7, safe\n\nT=98: y=8, freeway 8, Δt=8, safe (not 0 or 4)\n\nT=99: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collision at any point.\n\nTherefore, with H=9, all actions U, I can reach (0,9) at turn 99.\n\nBut the sequence should be actions from t=90 to t=98, 9 actions, to reach y=9 at turn 99.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since t1=90)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nup to Turn t_1 + 8: a_{t_1+8} = U\n\nt1=90, actions from t=90 to t=98, which is t1 to t1+8, 9 actions.\n\nt from 90 to 98 inclusive is 9 turns.\n\nAfter action at t=98, y_{99}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd minimal H is 9.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 8 at T=94 dangerous, but in this path, at T=94, I am on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at T=90, for freeways 5,6,7,8, they are dangerous, but I am not on them, so ok.\n\nIn this sequence, I am never on them at T=90.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut the car on freeway 5 at T=90, but I am at y=0, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo with all U actions, it works.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at T=92: Δt=2, car: lower = -59 + 6*2 = -59+12= -47, upper= -48 +12= -36? h=-48, s=6, upper = h + s Δt = -48 + 12 = -36\n\nlower = τ + s Δt = -59 +12 = -47\n\nSo [ -47, -36], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=8: lower=-59+48= -11, upper=-48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=94: Δt=4, dangerous? Earlier we said freeway 8 dangerous at Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, T=94.\n\nFirst car: lower = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11, upper = -48 + 48 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included, so dangerous.\n\nSecond car: at Δt=4, lower = -11 + 48 = 37, upper=48, [37,48], not dangerous.\n\nBut first car dangerous.\n\nIn our path, at T=94, I am on y=4, not y=8, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, at T=98, on y=8, Δt=8, as before, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo actions from turn 90 to 98, all U.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: a_{t_1 + 8} = U\n\nt_1 = 90, so:\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 99, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t.\n\nAfter a_t, position y_{t+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn T, position y_T.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt turn 90: take action a_90, then y_91 =1\n\nAt turn 91: position y_91=1, which is on freeway 1, and we check collision at turn 91.\n\nSimilarly, after a_91=U, y_92=2, at turn 92, position y_92=2, on freeway 2, check, etc.\n\nAll safe as above.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=9 is minimal possible, since I need to increase y by 9.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but no, start from 0.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I had to avoid something, but here not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to new y.\n\nFor example, when I take U at turn T, from y_T to y_{T+1} = y_T +1, at turn T, I am on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, no issue, since I move immediately.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on y_T, take U, then at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn collision, at each turn, I am only on one y.\n\nIn this sequence, it's fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t_1=90.\n\nAlso, H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's from t=90 to t=98, 9 actions.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I can write it as above.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the instruction, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it shows the actions, not H separately, but H is implied.\n\nIn the box, it has the turns and actions.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me make sure about freeway 8 at T=98.\n\nT=98, y=8, freeway 8, Δt=8.\n\nCars:\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nlower = -59 + 12*8 = -59 + 96 = 37\n\nupper = -48 + 96 = 48\n\n[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nlower = -11 + 96 = 85\n\nupper = 0 + 96 = 96? h=0, s=12, upper = h + s Δt = 0 + 96 =96\n\nlower = τ + s Δt = -11 + 96 =85\n\n[85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nAnd at T=94, freeway 8 is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 90\\) is 9, with all actions being \"U\" (up). This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) because:\n\n- At each turn, the player is on a freeway only when it is safe, as per the dangerous times derived from the car states.\n- Freeway 1 is always safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 0\\).\n- Freeways 2, 3, and 4 are dangerous only at turns 98 and 99 (\\(\\Delta t = 8, 9\\)), but in this sequence, the player is on them at turns 92, 93, and 94 (\\(\\Delta t = 2, 3, 4\\)), which are safe.\n- Freeways 5, 6, and 7 are dangerous only at turn 90 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)), but the player is on them at turns 95, 96, and 97 (\\(\\Delta t = 5, 6, 7\\)), which are safe.\n- Freeway 8 is dangerous at turns 90 and 94 (\\(\\Delta t = 0, 4\\)), but the player is on it at turn 98 (\\(\\Delta t = 8\\)), which is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 90, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 91.\n- At turn 91, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 92.\n- At turn 92, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 93.\n- At turn 93, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 94.\n- At turn 94, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 95.\n- At turn 95, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 96.\n- At turn 96, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 97.\n- At turn 97, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 98.\n- At turn 98, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 99.\n\nAt turn 99, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), and no collisions occur during the sequence.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 96, and I start at y=0. Actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and the car's span includes 0 at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at any future turn. The car positions are given at turn t₁=96, and for any turn T > t₁, I can compute their span based on the direction and speed.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t₁, so for turn T, Δt = T - 96.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is:\n\n- If direction is right: span = [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt] because for right-moving, head is larger, so span is [tail, head] but in the update, it says for right: [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] and since τ is tail and h is head, for right-moving, head is at higher x, so [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt].\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], and since for left, head is at smaller x, so [h, τ] becomes [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt].\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection is given as \"right\" or \"left\", I assume.\n\nIn the table, it says \"direction d\", and in the examples, it's written as \"right\" or \"left\", like for freeway 1: (48,37,right,3), so d is direction.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in the span [low, high] at that turn.\n\nThe span must contain 0.\n\nAlso, note that at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible there. y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nI start at (0,0) at turn t₁=96, and I need to reach (0,9).\n\nSince I start at y=0, which is safe, and end at y=9, safe.\n\nThe freeways y=1 to y=8 have cars.\n\nI need to move up to y=9, but I can move down or stay as well, but since I need to go up, probably I should go up most of the time, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least 9, since I need to increase y by 9, and each U increases by 1, so minimum H=9 if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, I need to see for each freeway, at which times the cars make it unsafe, i.e., when 0 is in their span.\n\nThen for each turn, for each y, I can see if it's safe to be there.\n\nBut since I move step by step, I need to plan the sequence.\n\nMoreover, the safety depends on the turn when I'm on that y.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3)\n\nSince d=right, at time T, span = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [37 + 3Δt, 48 + 3Δt] where Δt = T - 96\n\nCollision if 0 in [37 + 3Δt, 48 + 3Δt]\n\nSince 37 + 3Δt to 48 + 3Δt, which for Δt=0, [37,48], all positive, so 0 not in it. As Δt increases, the interval moves right, so min is increasing, so 0 will never be in this interval since min=37+3Δt >=37 >0. So freeway 1 is always safe? 37 + 3Δt >=37>0, so low end >0, so 0 never in span. Yes, so freeway 1 has no collision possible for any T. Good.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-59 + 6Δt, -48 + 6Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-59 + 6Δt, -48 + 6Δt]\n\nSet low = -59 + 6Δt, high = -48 + 6Δt\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -59 + 6Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 6Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/6 = 9.833, so Δt <= 9 since integer? Δt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nT and t₁ are integers, I assume, so Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, all positions, but cars can be at non-integer? The span can have non-integer values? The head and tail are given as integers, but since speed and time, positions can be fractional? The problem doesn't specify, but in the collision, it says 0 in span, so if span is real interval, 0 can be inside.\n\nBut in terms of grid, the player is at x=0, which is integer, but cars can be at fractional positions? The problem says \"on a 2D grid\", but vertical is discrete y=0 to 9, horizontal might be continuous or discrete? It doesn't specify.\n\nLook back: \"position (0, y_t)\" and cars have head and tail, which are numbers, and span is computed with s(T-t1), which could be fractional.\n\nCollision if 0 in the span, which is a real interval, I think.\n\nBut for simplicity, since we care about 0, and speeds are integers, it might be ok.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 2:\n\nlow = -59 + 6Δt\n\nhigh = -48 + 6Δt\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -59 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so for Δt <= 9\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 6Δt => 6Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 8\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 9 inclusive? Let's see:\n\nΔt >= 8 and Δt <=9\n\nΔt=8: low = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, since high=0.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=9: low = -59 + 54 = -5, high = -48 + 54 = 6, so [ -5, 6], 0 included.\n\nΔt=10: low = -59 + 60 =1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nΔt=7: low = -59 +42= -17, high= -48+42= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for Δt=8 and 9, collision on freeway 2.\n\nT = t₁ + Δt = 96 + Δt, so at turns 104 and 105, freeway 2 is unsafe.\n\nΔt=8: T=96+8=104\n\nΔt=9: T=105\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" same as freeway 2.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 2 and 3, it's the same.\n\nFreeway 4: also \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" same.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt]\n\nSince min=37+12Δt >=37>0, so always >0, never contains 0. Safe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt] = [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -11 + 12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\nSet low = -11 + 12Δt, high = 12Δt\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high\n\nlow <=0: -11 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so for Δt=0 only? Since Δt integer, Δt=0: low=-11, high=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=1: low=-11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, which is T=t₁=96, collision on this car for freeway 5.\n\nBut at T=96, if I am on freeway 5, I would collide, but I start at y=0, not on freeway 5, so at t=96, I'm safe.\n\nFor future, only at Δt=0 it is unsafe, but Δt=0 is past when we consider future turns, so for T>96, this car is always safe? At T=96+Δt for Δt>=1, low = -11 +12Δt >= -11+12=1>0 for Δt>=1, so high >=12>0, so [1,12] or larger, all positive, so 0 not in span. So second car on freeway 5 is only unsafe at exactly T=96, but since we start at T=96 and not on it, for T>96 it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, first car always safe.\n\nSo freeway 5 is always safe for T>96.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? \"(48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\" identical.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same.\n\nNow freeway 8: \"(-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\"\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-59 + 12Δt, -48 + 12Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -59 +12Δt, -48 +12Δt ]\n\nSo low <=0 <= high\n\n-59 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so Δt <=4\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +12Δt => 12Δt >=48 => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt=4: low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=5: low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: low= -59+36= -23, high= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only Δt=4, T=96+4=100, unsafe.\n\nNow second car on freeway 8: (0,-11,right,12) same as before, span [ -11 +12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\nUnsafe only at Δt=0, T=96, which is past, so for T>96, safe.\n\nThus for freeway 8, only unsafe at T=100 due to first car.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway when it is unsafe:\n\nFreeway 1: always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=104 and 105 (Δt=8,9)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, unsafe at T=104,105\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=104,105\n\nFreeway 5: always safe for T>96\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=100\n\nAnd freeway 2,3,4 unsafe at 104,105.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t=96.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nI need a sequence of actions from t=96 to some t=96+H-1, so after H-1 actions, at turn t=96 + (H-1), y should be 9.\n\nLet me define the turn index.\n\nSet t=96 as time 0 for simplicity, so let τ = t - 96, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, position y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some τ = H-1, after H-1 turns.\n\nAfter k actions, at time τ=k, y_k should be such that after H-1 actions, at time τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from τ=0 to τ=H-2? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn τ, before action, position is y_τ, then action a_τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nStandard: at time τ, position y_τ, then I choose action a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on a_τ.\n\nThen at time τ+1, I am at y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision occurs at time τ if I am on a freeway k=y_τ, and for that freeway, at time τ, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T = k for k=1-8, and for freeway k, at time T, 0 is in some car's span, then collision.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, if I choose to move to y_{T+1} != y_T, at turn T I am still on y_T, so I collide only if y_T is unsafe at time T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and check if that is unsafe at time T+1.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ, but y=9 is always safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H: since I start at y=0, end at y=9, and must go through y=1 to 8, but I can take multiple turns at same y or go down, but to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, unsafe freeways at times:\n\nFrom above, with τ = t - 96.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at τ=8,9 (since T=104,105, τ=8,9)\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: unsafe τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe τ=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at τ=4 (T=100, τ=4)\n\nτ=4 is for freeway 8.\n\nNow, y=1 to 8 correspond to freeways.\n\nI need to be on each y=k for k=1 to 8 at some time, but I can be on a y multiple times, or skip if I go fast, but I have to be on y=9 at end.\n\nSince I start at 0, end at 9, and move one step at a time, I must pass through each y from 0 to 9, but I can stay or go down, so the path must cover from 0 to 9, but with possible detours.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go directly up, but avoid the times when the freeway is unsafe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so the number of U actions must be 9 more than D actions, and S actions don't change, so to minimize H, I should minimize S and D, so ideally all U, H=9 actions, from τ=0 to τ=8, at τ=9 I would be at y=9.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter action a_0 at τ=0, y_1 at τ=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{8} at τ=8, y_9 at τ=9.\n\nI need y_9 =9.\n\nSo if I do all U, then y_τ = τ for τ=0 to 9? At τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nAfter a_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_8=U, y_9=9\n\nSo at time τ, y_τ = τ.\n\nNow, collision at time τ if y_τ = k and freeway k is unsafe at time τ.\n\nFor τ from 0 to 8, y_τ = τ, so for k=τ, but for k=1 to 8.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, safe.\n\nτ=1, y=1, freeway 1: always safe, so ok.\n\nτ=2, y=2, freeway 2: unsafe at τ=8,9, but τ=2, which is not 8 or 9, and freeway 2 is safe except τ=8,9, so at τ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly τ=3, y=3, freeway 3: unsafe only τ=8,9, so safe at τ=3.\n\nτ=4, y=4, freeway 4: unsafe τ=8,9, safe at τ=4.\n\nτ=5, y=5, freeway 5: always safe, ok.\n\nτ=6, y=6, freeway 6: always safe, ok.\n\nτ=7, y=7, freeway 7: always safe, ok.\n\nτ=8, y=8, freeway 8: unsafe at τ=4, but τ=8, which is not 4, and freeway 8 is unsafe only at τ=4, so at τ=8, safe? Freeway 8 unsafe only at τ=4, yes.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, at τ=4, when y=4, but in this all-up path, at τ=4, y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 is unsafe at τ=8,9? τ=8,9, but τ=4 is not 8 or 9.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at τ=8 and 9? Earlier I have freeway 2,3,4 all unsafe at τ=8,9.\n\nBut in this case, at τ=4, y=4, freeway 4 is safe, since unsafe only at τ=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=8, in this path y=8, freeway 8, which is unsafe only at τ=4, not at τ=8, so safe.\n\nAnd at τ=9, y=9, safe.\n\nBut τ=9 is when I reach y=9, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=8, y=8, freeway 8 is safe at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, all seem safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 unsafe at τ=8 and 9.\n\nIn all-up, at τ=8, y=8, which is freeway 8, not freeway 2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nAt τ=8, y=8, so I am on freeway 8, which is safe at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=9, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, when would freeway 2,3,4 be unsafe? Only if I am on them at τ=8 or 9.\n\nIn all-up, I am on y=2 at τ=2, which is safe; y=3 at τ=3, safe; y=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut freeway 8 unsafe at τ=4, but in all-up, at τ=4, I am on y=4, freeway 4, not freeway 8.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, with all U actions, I can go directly to y=9 in 9 turns, with no collision.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=96), position y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_0=U, then y_1=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, freeway 1: safe.\n\nAction a_1=U, y_2=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, freeway 2: unsafe at τ=8,9, but τ=2 !=8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_2=U, y_3=3 at τ=3, freeway 3 safe.\n\na_3=U, y_4=4 at τ=4, freeway 4 safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=5 at τ=5, freeway 5 safe.\n\na_5=U, y_6=6 at τ=6, freeway 6 safe.\n\na_6=U, y_7=7 at τ=7, freeway 7 safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=8 at τ=8, freeway 8: unsafe at τ=4, but τ=8 !=4, so safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=9 at τ=9, safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\nH is the number of turns? The sequence of actions.\n\nFrom turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nIn this case, actions from τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 actions, H=9.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, but let's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt_1 + H - 1 is the turn when we have position after actions.\n\nSet t = t_1 + k for k=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, then action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut y_{t+1} is after action.\n\nThe position is given at turn t_1, which is before any action, I think.\n\n\"current turn is t_1\", \"initial position (0, y_{t_1})\" so at turn t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}).\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 + 0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) + 1? No.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then we perform action a_T, then position becomes y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo after performing a_T, at turn T+1, position is y_{T+1}.\n\nWe need that at some turn, position is 9.\n\nSpecifically, \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, meaning that at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nNow, turn t_1 + H - 1 is after we have performed H-1 actions? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t_1: position y_{t_1} = 0\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}: position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}: position y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSet t = t_1 + H - 1, so at turn t, position is 9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2} to reach position at t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but after a_{t_1 + H -1}, position is y_{t_1 + H}, which is not necessarily 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) + 1 = t_1 + H should be considered, but we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\n\"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThis position is determined by the actions up to a_{t_1 + H - 2}, because a_{t_1 + H - 2} determines y_{t_1 + H -1} from y_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nLet me define:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is chosen, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo y_{T+1} depends on a_T.\n\nThe state at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to some point.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + k}, we have y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 for some H.\n\nThat means, at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nThis is achieved after applying actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2}, because a_{t_1 + H - 2} determines y_{t_1 + H -1} from y_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThe actions sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for the indices, but the position is set at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor the sequence to have H actions, but the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} would affect y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nSo the number of actions to reach position at time t_1 + H -1 is H-1 actions? Confusing.\n\nLet K = H - 1, so that after K actions, we are at turn t_1 + K with position y_{t_1 + K} =9.\n\nThen the sequence has K actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + K -1}.\n\nBut the problem says H turns, and actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that \"turns\" refer to the number of actions taken.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H means minimal number of actions.\n\nAnd after H actions, we reach the position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAlso in the answer format, it shows actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, etc.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t_1 + 1 -1} = y_{t_1} =0, but we need to reach 9, not possible, so H>1.\n\nIf I do one action, say at t_1, a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} is set, which could be 1 if U.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position is y_{t_1 +1}, which is not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it means that after H-1 actions, position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is given as {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which has H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_{t_1}\n\nt=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter these H actions, the position at turn t_1 + H is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is before the last action.\n\nSo for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it must be that after the first H-1 actions, position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9, and then the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} might be redundant or something, but we have to include it or not?\n\nThe sequence has H actions, but the position is reached at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps for the last action, when we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we can choose a_{t_1 + H -1} to stay or something, but since we are already at 9, it might be unnecessary.\n\nBut in the context, to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, we only need actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}, so the action a_{t_1 + H -1} is not needed for reaching, but we have to specify the sequence up to H-1 actions for the position at t_1 + H -1.\n\nI think there is a confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me look at the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\"\n...\n\"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd after these H actions, the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H is set, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position before the last action.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it must be that after the first H-1 actions (from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}), position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9, then a_{t_1 + H -1} is chosen, but since we are already at 9, a_{t_1 + H -1} could be S, but it doesn't change position, so at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9, and we perform a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might be S, then at turn t_1 + H, position still 9.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, so the action a_{t_1 + H -1} is performed at that turn, but it affects the next position.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on the position at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we have y_T, then we check collision for y_T at time T, then we perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the sequence, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need that after actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen for the action at turn t_1 + H -1, a_{t_1 + H -1}, it is part of the sequence but doesn't affect the reaching, so to minimize H, we can set a_{t_1 + H -1} to S or U or D, but since we are at 9, U or D might go out of bound, so S is safe.\n\nBut in terms of minimal H, H includes this action.\n\nSince we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, and we perform an action there, but for reaching, the minimal H might be when we reach exactly at that turn with no extra action.\n\nIn the all-up case, to reach y=9, we need to go from y=0 to y=9, so after 9 actions of U, at turn t_1 +9, position y_{t_1 +9} =9.\n\nThen for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +9, y=9, and we perform action a_{t_1 +9}.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9} for H=10.\n\nBut with 9 U actions, we reach y=9 at turn t_1+9.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, set t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9}, but a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+8} are the U actions to go from 0 to 9, and a_{t_1+9} can be S, for example.\n\nBut we can reach with H=10.\n\nWith H=9, y_{t_1 +9 -1} = y_{t_1+8}, which with 8 U actions, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo to reach y=9, minimal H must be at least 10, I think, because from y=0, after k actions, y can be at most k, so to have y=9, need at least 9 actions, so after 9 actions, at turn t_1+9, y=9 possible.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=9, y_{t_1+8} =9, but after 8 actions, y at most 8, so impossible.\n\nWith 8 actions, y <=8, so y_{t_1+8} <=8 <9.\n\nWith 9 actions, y_{t_1+9} <=9, can be 9.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need t_1 + H -1 >= t_1 +9, so H-1 >=9, H>=10.\n\nThen with H=10, y_{t_1+9} =9 possible.\n\nThen the actions are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9}, 10 actions.\n\na_{t_1} to a_{t_1+8} can be U to go up, and a_{t_1+9} can be S to stay at 9.\n\nOr something.\n\nBut in terms of collision, at each turn, we need to ensure that at the position y_T, it is safe for that turn T.\n\nBack to the game.\n\nIn the all-up case with 9 U actions, we reach y=9 at turn t_1+9.\n\nBut for the sequence with H=10, to have y_{t_1+9} =9, we can have a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+8} = U, and a_{t_1+9} = S, for example.\n\nThen at turns:\nTurn t_1: y=0, safe, action U, then y_{t_1+1}=1\nTurn t_1+1: y=1, freeway 1 safe, action U, y_{t_1+2}=2\n...\nTurn t_1+8: y=8, freeway 8, at time t_1+8, τ=8 from t_1, freeway 8 safe as before, action U, then y_{t_1+9}=9\nTurn t_1+9: y=9, safe, action S, but we don't care.\n\nAnd we have y_{t_1+9} =9 at turn t_1+9, which for H=10, t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +10-1 = t_1+9, yes.\n\nNow, in this path, as we saw, no collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 2,3,4 unsafe at τ=8,9, but in this path, at τ=8 (t_1+8), I am on y=8, not on y=2,3,4, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly at τ=9 (t_1+9), y=9, safe.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, we have cars, but they are always safe except at t_1 for some, but not at future times.\n\nSo with all U, I can reach in 9 actions to y=9 at turn t_1+9, but for the sequence, with H=10 actions to have position at t_1+9=9.\n\nMinimal H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster, but from 0 to 9, minimum 9 U actions, so at least 9 actions, so H at least 10 for the sequence to have y at t_1+H-1=9.\n\nH=10 is minimal possible.\n\nAnd with all U, it works.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at τ=4, which is t_1+4.\n\nIn all-up, at t_1+4, y=4, which is freeway 4, not freeway 8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t_1+8, y=8, freeway 8, τ=8, which is not 4, so safe.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 unsafe at τ=8 and 9.\n\nAt τ=8, t_1+8, in all-up, y=8, not 2,3,4.\n\nAt τ=9, t_1+9, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut for freeway 5,6,7, always safe, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can just go straight up.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 5,6,7, there are cars, but as we saw, for T>96, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10, with actions: from turn t_1 to t_1+8: U, and turn t_1+9: S or U, but if U at y=9, it might go to 10, but y=10 not allowed, so must stay or down, but down to 8, not good, so S is better.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would go to 10, which is invalid, so probably not allowed, or clamped, but the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I think it is clamped, but to be safe, better not to U at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, D at y=0 not allowed.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1+9, y=9, we should do S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nBut for the action at t_1+9, it doesn't affect reaching, but we have to include it.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=10.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 8 at τ=4?\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car states.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, unsafe at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, in all-up, I am on y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is unsafe only at τ=8 and 9, not at τ=4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at τ=8,9, but τ=4 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's list the positions and times:\n\nTurn | y | freeway | safe?\n\nt_1 (96) : y=0, safe\n\na_t1=U\n\nt_1+1 (97): y=1, freeway 1, always safe\n\na=U\n\nt_1+2 (98): y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at t=104,105 which is τ=8,9, τ=2 now, safe\n\na=U\n\nt_1+3 (99): y=3, freeway 3, similar, safe\n\na=U\n\nt_1+4 (100): y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at τ=8,9, τ=4 safe\n\nBut at t=100, τ=4, freeway 8 is unsafe, but I am on y=4, not y=8, so ok.\n\na=U\n\nt_1+5 (101): y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na=U\n\nt_1+6 (102): y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na=U\n\nt_1+7 (103): y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\na=U\n\nt_1+8 (104): y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at τ=4 (t=100), but τ=8 now, safe\n\na=U\n\nt_1+9 (105): y=9, safe\n\nThen for the sequence, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn this, at t_1+9, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +9, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9}.\n\na_{t_1} to a_{t_1+8} are U, a_{t_1+9} should be S to stay, since at y=9.\n\na_{t_1+9} at turn t_1+9, position y=9, then action a_{t_1+9}, if U, y would be 10, invalid, so must be S or D, but D to 8 not good, so S.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t_1+9} can be S.\n\nNow, but in the output, for turn t_1+9, we output the action.\n\nBut since we reach at t_1+9, and do S, it's fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with less than 10? H=10 is minimal as explained.\n\nPerhaps with some S or D, but that would take more turns, so H larger, not smaller.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, there are two cars each, but as we saw, only one was potentially unsafe at t_1 but not later.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in freeway 5, at τ=0, it was unsafe, but we not on it.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 8 at τ=4.\n\nt=100, freeway 8 unsafe.\n\nBut in path, at t=100, I am on y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which at t=100, τ=4, is safe, since unsafe only at τ=8,9.\n\nτ=8 is t=104.\n\nSimilarly, at t=104, τ=8, freeway 2,3,4 unsafe, but at t=104, in path, y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at τ=8.\n\nAt t=105, τ=9, y=9, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is simple.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nNow, current turn t_1=96.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nThen at turn 104, after U, y=9 at turn 105.\n\nBut we need y at turn t_1 + H -1 =96 + H -1.\n\nSet to 105, so 96 + H -1 =105, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen at turn 105, y=9, we need to specify action.\n\nTurn 105: S\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 96 to 105.\n\nTurn 96: U (to y=1 at t=97)\n\n...\n\nTurn 104: U (to y=9 at t=105)\n\nThen turn 105: S (stay at y=9)\n\nAnd y at turn 105 is 9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nBut is there any issue with the cars? I think not.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at some point I need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at turn 100, freeway 8 is unsafe, but I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 104, freeway 2,3,4 unsafe, but I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 104 is safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10, with all U from turn 96 to 104, and S at 105.\n\nBut action at 105 is S.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 105 action is S, but since position is already 9, it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=10 with a_{t_1+9} not needed, but I have to include.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7, there is a car with head 0 at t_1, but at t_1, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so ok.\n\nAnd for future, no issue.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and in this case, no collision.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nH=10\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: S\n\nBut turn 105 is t_1 + 9, and H=10, t from 0 to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+9}.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nThe first one unsafe at τ=4, t=100.\n\nSecond one unsafe only at τ=0, t=96.\n\nAt t=100, the first car span [ -59 +12*4, -48 +12*4] = [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 8 at t=100, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the player can go faster, but cannot, since each step changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 96: U \\\\ Turn 97: U \\\\ Turn 98: U \\\\ Turn 99: U \\\\ Turn 100: U \\\\ Turn 101: U \\\\ Turn 102: U \\\\ Turn 103: U \\\\ Turn 104: U \\\\ Turn 105: S }\n\nBut turn 105 is t_1 +9, since t_1=96.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =96+10-1=105, yes.\n\nAnd action at 105 is S.\n\nIn the sequence, it's included.\n\nTo save, but H=10 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps at turn 104, I can do S instead of U, but y would be 8, not 9, so not reached.\n\nOr something, but no.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 96\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving directly upward, as the car movement patterns do not pose a collision risk at the times the player occupies each freeway in this path.\n\n- At turn 96, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars).
