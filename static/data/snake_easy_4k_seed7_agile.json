        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the scenario clearly.\n\n1. **Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 1 \\)\n   - This is the first turn of the game.\n\n2. **Cells occupied by walls**:\n   - **Border Cells**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is bounded by walls at these coordinates, forming an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: [(5, 2)]. There's a single internal wall at (5, 2).\n\n3. **Snake Positions**: [(3, 2)]\n   - The snake currently consists of only its head at position (3, 2). There are no body segments yet since the length is 1.\n\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)\n   - The snake is currently moving downward. On the grid, moving down decreases the y-coordinate (since y=0 is likely the bottom).\n\n5. **Food Positions, Life Span, and Value**:\n   - (1, 1, 9, 1): Food at (1,1) with value +9 and life span 1.\n   - (5, 3, 9, 1): Food at (5,3) with value +9 and life span 1.\n   - (5, 6, 9, 1): Food at (5,6) with value +9 and life span 1.\n   - (3, 4, 10, 1): Food at (3,4) with value +10 and life span 1.\n\n   Note: The life span indicates how many turns the food will remain before disappearing. Since all have life span 1, they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot instantly reverse its direction to Up (U) in the next move (as per the \"No instant reverse\" rule). So, possible immediate actions are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move from the current position (3, 2):\n\n1. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - Current position: (3, 2)\n   - Moving Down: (x, y-1) → (3, 1)\n   - Check for walls:\n     - y=1 is not a border wall (border is y=0).\n     - No internal walls at (3,1).\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (3,1).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (3,1), no food eaten, no collision.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - Current position: (3, 2)\n   - Moving Left: (x-1, y) → (2, 2)\n   - Check for walls:\n     - x=2 is not a border wall (border is x=0).\n     - No internal walls at (2,2).\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (2,2).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (2,2), no food eaten, no collision.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**:\n   - Current position: (3, 2)\n   - Moving Right: (x+1, y) → (4, 2)\n   - Check for walls:\n     - x=4 is not a border wall (border is x=7).\n     - No internal walls at (4,2).\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (4,2).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (4,2), no food eaten, no collision.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nAll food items have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Currently, the snake is at (3,2), and the nearest foods are:\n\n- (1,1): Distance of |3-1| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (5,3): Distance of |3-5| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (5,6): Distance of |3-5| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- (3,4): Distance of |3-3| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nThe closest food is at (3,4), which is 2 units away (directly above the snake's head). However, the snake is currently moving Down (D), and cannot reverse to Up (U) in the next move. Therefore, it cannot reach (3,4) this turn.\n\nThe next closest foods are at (1,1) and (5,3), both 3 units away. To reach them in the fewest moves:\n\n- To reach (1,1):\n  - From (3,2), need to move Left twice and Down once (or Down once and Left twice).\n  - Could do L then D then L, or D then L then L, etc.\n  \n- To reach (5,3):\n  - From (3,2), need to move Right twice and Up once.\n  - But cannot move Up next, so would have to do R then R then U (but then the food would be gone by then).\n\nGiven that all foods disappear after this turn, the snake cannot reach any food this turn because:\n\n- (3,4) is 2 away, cannot reach in 1 move (since cannot go Up).\n- Others are 3 away, cannot reach in 1 move.\n\n### Choosing the Best Immediate Action\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future moves where it might reach food.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\n- **Move Down (D)**: (3,1)\n  - Next possible moves from (3,1): D (to (3,0) - border wall, so invalid), L (to (2,1)), R (to (4,1))\n  - From (3,1), could then move towards (1,1) by going Left twice.\n\n- **Move Left (L)**: (2,2)\n  - Next possible moves from (2,2): D (to (2,1)), L (to (1,2)), R (to (3,2) - but cannot reverse to R after L)\n  - From (2,2), could move towards (1,1) by going L then D.\n\n- **Move Right (R)**: (4,2)\n  - Next possible moves from (4,2): D (to (4,1)), L (to (3,2) - reverse, invalid), R (to (5,2) - but (5,2) is an internal wall)\n  - From (4,2), moving R is blocked by wall at (5,2), so only D is viable next.\n\nBetween these, moving Left seems better because:\n\n- From (2,2), can then go Left to (1,2), then Down to (1,1) to eat the +9 food next turn (if it respawns).\n- Moving Down to (3,1) is also safe but doesn't seem to lead towards any food directly.\n- Moving Right to (4,2) is less flexible due to the wall at (5,2).\n\nHowever, since all foods disappear after this turn, the immediate move doesn't affect food consumption this turn. Therefore, the main goal is to avoid getting stuck and maintain maneuverability.\n\nGiven that, moving Left to (2,2) seems slightly better as it opens up the possibility to move towards where the (1,1) food was, in case new food appears there.\n\nBut since the snake is alone and no immediate threats, all moves are safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (3,1) is also safe and keeps options open.\n\nGiven that, and since the snake is at (3,2), moving Left to (2,2) seems reasonable to start moving towards the left side where one of the foods was.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- No body segments to collide with (length is 1).\n- Moving Left to (2,2): no walls or obstacles.\n- Moving Down to (3,1): no walls or obstacles.\n- Moving Right to (4,2): no walls or obstacles (but next move right is blocked by wall at (5,2)).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that all moves are safe and no food can be eaten this turn, choosing a move that positions the snake towards where high-value food was seems reasonable. Moving Left starts heading towards where the (1,1) food was.\n\nThus, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This means the snake's head is at (2, 2), and since there's only one segment, there's no body or tail yet.\n   - **Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Left (\"L\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are four pieces of food on the grid:\n     - (1, 1): value = 8, life_span = 1\n     - (5, 3): value = 8, life_span = 1\n     - (5, 6): value = 8, life_span = 1\n     - (3, 4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving Left (\"L\"), the possible moves are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: Continue moving left to (1, 2)\n- **Up (U)**: Change direction to up, moving to (2, 3)\n- **Down (D)**: Change direction to down, moving to (2, 1)\n\nNote: Moving Right (\"R\") is the opposite of the current direction (\"L\"), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1, 2)\n- **New Head Position**: (1, 2)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=1 is within bounds (1 to 6), y=2 is within bounds (1 to 6).\n  - (1, 2) is not an internal wall (only internal wall is at (5, 2)).\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food is listed at (1, 2).\n- **Outcome**:\n  - No food eaten; snake length remains 1.\n  - New position: [(1, 2)]\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2, 3)\n- **New Head Position**: (2, 3)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=2 is within bounds, y=3 is within bounds.\n  - (2, 3) is not an internal wall.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food is listed at (2, 3).\n- **Outcome**:\n  - No food eaten; snake length remains 1.\n  - New position: [(2, 3)]\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2, 1)\n- **New Head Position**: (2, 1)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=2 is within bounds, y=1 is within bounds.\n  - (2, 1) is not an internal wall.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food is listed at (2, 1).\n- **Outcome**:\n  - No food eaten; snake length remains 1.\n  - New position: [(2, 1)]\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate adjacent cells (left, up, down) have food. The closest foods are:\n\n1. (1, 1): To reach this, we could move left to (1, 2) next turn, then down to (1, 1).\n   - But the life_span of this food is 1, and it's turn 2 now. Next turn (turn 3), the life_span will be 0, so it will disappear before we can eat it.\n2. (5, 3), (5, 6), (3, 4): All are multiple moves away with life_span=1, so they'll disappear by turn 3, making them unreachable in time.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Snake\n\nThe snake's current position is (2, 2). Is there any food under the snake?\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (1, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (3, 4) — none are at (2, 2), so no food is under the snake currently.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nSince the snake has only one segment (head), there's no tail to consider for the \"Tail Reward Danger\" scenario.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven that:\n- No immediate food is adjacent to the head.\n- All foods will disappear by the next turn (life_span=1 at turn 2 means they vanish at turn 3).\n- Moving in any direction doesn't lead to food this turn.\n- No immediate collision risks (no walls or body segments in adjacent cells).\n\nThus, the choice of move doesn't affect the score this turn. We can choose any valid direction except the reverse (Right). \n\nSince the snake is currently moving Left, continuing Left seems reasonable unless there's a strategic reason to change direction. However, since all directions are equally safe and don't lead to food, we can choose any. \n\nBut looking ahead, moving Left to (1, 2) could be a step towards the bottom-left corner where (1, 1) is, but that food will disappear. Alternatively, moving Up or Down keeps more options open for future turns when new food spawns.\n\nGiven that, moving Up might be slightly better to position the snake towards the center where future food is more likely to appear.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest move is to continue in the current direction to maintain simplicity, as all moves are equally safe and no food is immediately accessible.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — the snake can't move here.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (1, 1), body at (1, 2).\n   - Current direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn (from (1,2) to (1,1)).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5, 3): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (5, 6): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (3, 4): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (5, 1): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (1,1) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (1, 1) → (1, 2)\n  - But the body is at (1,2), and moving here would cause the head to collide with the body immediately after the tail moves, which is deadly (since the tail moves forward, but the head is moving onto where the tail was, and the body segment is still there).\n- **Down (D)**: (1, 1) → (1, 0)\n  - y=0 is a wall, so this is a wall collision — deadly.\n- **Left (L)**: (1, 1) → (0, 1)\n  - x=0 is a wall — deadly.\n- **Right (R)**: (1, 1) → (2, 1)\n  - This seems safe; let's check:\n    - Is (2,1) occupied by the snake's body? No, only (1,1) and (1,2) are.\n    - Is (2,1) a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7, y=0,7, and (5,2).\n    - Is there food at (2,1)? No, food is at (5,3), (5,6), (3,4), (5,1).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (5,3), (5,6), (3,4), (5,1) — none are adjacent to (1,1), so we can't eat any food this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Immediate Safety\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- U: deadly (body collision)\n- D: deadly (wall)\n- L: deadly (wall)\n- R: safe\n\nSo, the only safe move is Right (R).\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nEven though we can't eat food this turn, moving right to (2,1) might open up opportunities to reach food in future turns. For example:\n- From (2,1), possible next moves would be U (to (2,2)), D (to (2,0) — wall), L (to (1,1) — but can't reverse direction from R to L next turn), R (to (3,1)).\n  - U to (2,2): then could go towards (3,4) food.\n  - R to (3,1): then could go towards (5,1) or (3,4).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe don't have to worry about this here because:\n- The tail is at (1,2), and the head is moving to (2,1), not adjacent to the tail's new position (which would be (1,1) after moving, but the head is at (2,1), not adjacent to (1,1)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move at turn 4 is Right (R). All other moves lead to immediate death.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(5, 3): value = +5, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (2,1): |5-2| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n2. (5, 6): value = +5, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |5-2| + |6-1| = 3 + 5 = 8\n3. (3, 4): value = +6, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |3-2| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n4. (5, 1): value = +9, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |5-2| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\nThe food at (5,1) is the closest (distance 3) and has the highest value (+9). However, let's see if we can reach it safely.\n\n### Path to the Highest Value Food (5,1)\n\nCurrent head: (2,1)\nFood at (5,1): need to move right by +3 in x.\n\nPossible moves to reach (5,1):\n\nFrom (2,1):\n- R to (3,1)\nFrom (3,1):\n- R to (4,1)\nFrom (4,1):\n- R to (5,1)\n\nThis is a straight path right. But we need to ensure no collisions at each step.\n\nFirst move: from (2,1) to (3,1) - valid (as checked above).\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), the snake would be:\n- Head: (3,1)\n- Body: [(2,1)]\n\nNext move would be R to (4,1):\n- Check if (4,1) is valid:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Body after move would be [(3,1)] - no collision.\n\nThen R to (5,1):\n- Check if (5,1) is valid:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Body after move would be [(4,1)] - no collision.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the life_span of the food. All foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So, if we don't reach the food this turn, it will disappear.\n\nBut the food at (5,1) is 3 units away in x-direction, and we can only move 1 unit per turn, so we cannot reach it this turn. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn, making it unattainable.\n\n### Re-evaluating Reachable Food\n\nGiven that all foods have life_span = 1, and we can only move one step per turn, the only food we can reach this turn is one that is adjacent to the current head position (2,1).\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,1):\n- U: (2,2)\n- D: (2,0) - invalid (wall)\n- L: (1,1) - body segment, but instant reverse is not allowed (current direction is R)\n- R: (3,1)\n\nCheck if any food is at these positions:\n- (2,2): No food listed.\n- (3,1): No food listed.\n- (1,1): No food listed (it's the body segment).\n\nSo, none of the adjacent cells have food that can be eaten this turn. Therefore, we cannot eat any food this turn, and all current foods will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nSince we cannot eat any food this turn, our goal is to move to a safe position that keeps options open for future moves.\n\nValid moves: U, R\n\n1. Move U to (2,2):\n   - New head: (2,2)\n   - Body: [(2,1)]\n   - Future options from (2,2):\n     - Can move U, D, L, R (no instant reverse unless we know next direction)\n     - Not near any walls or obstacles immediately.\n\n2. Move R to (3,1):\n   - New head: (3,1)\n   - Body: [(2,1)]\n   - Future options from (3,1):\n     - Can move U, D, R (no L, since current move is R)\n     - Moving R brings us closer to the right wall, which may limit future options.\n\nBetween U and R, moving U seems better because:\n- It moves the snake towards the center of the grid, giving more future movement options.\n- Moving R towards the wall may corner the snake sooner.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving U or R?\n\n- Moving U to (2,2):\n  - Next turn, the body will be at (2,1), so no collision.\n  - No walls or obstacles at (2,2).\n  \n- Moving R to (3,1):\n  - Next turn, the body will be at (2,1), so no collision.\n  - No walls or obstacles at (3,1).\n\nBoth moves are safe, but U seems more strategic for long-term movement.\n\n### Considering Future Food Spawns\n\nSince all current foods will disappear after this turn, new foods will spawn in future turns. Moving towards the center (U) may position the snake better to reach new foods that could spawn anywhere in the grid.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Up (U), as it is safe and positions the snake more centrally for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (5, 2). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n4. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: [(2, 2), (2, 1)] \n     - Head is at (2, 2)\n     - Body segment is at (2, 1)\n   - **Direction**: U (Up, which means the snake is moving upwards, i.e., increasing y-coordinate).\n5. **Food**:\n   - (5, 3, 4, 1): Position (5, 3), life_span = 4, value = +1 (positive food)\n   - (5, 6, 4, 1): Position (5, 6), life_span = 4, value = +1\n   - (3, 4, 5, 1): Position (3, 4), life_span = 5, value = +1\n   - (5, 1, 8, 1): Position (5, 1), life_span = 8, value = +1\n\n### Snake Movement Constraints\n\n- **Current Direction**: U (Up)\n- **Cannot Reverse**: Since the current direction is U, the snake cannot immediately move D (Down) in the next turn.\n- **Possible Moves**: U, L, R\n\n### Possible Next Moves from (2, 2)\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move (U, L, R) to see if it's valid and safe:\n\n1. **Move U (Up)**: (2, 2) → (2, 3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Wall**: y=7 is the upper wall. (2, 3) is within bounds.\n     - **Body**: Snake body is at (2, 1). (2, 3) is not part of the body.\n     - **Obstacle**: Internal obstacle is at (5, 2). No collision.\n   - **Food Check**: Is there food at (2, 3)?\n     - Current food positions: (5,3), (5,6), (3,4), (5,1). No food at (2,3).\n   - **Safe Move**: Yes.\n\n2. **Move L (Left)**: (2, 2) → (1, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Wall**: x=0 is the left wall. (1, 2) is within bounds.\n     - **Body**: Snake body is at (2, 1). (1, 2) is not part of the body.\n     - **Obstacle**: Internal obstacle is at (5, 2). No collision.\n   - **Food Check**: Is there food at (1, 2)?\n     - No food at (1,2).\n   - **Safe Move**: Yes.\n\n3. **Move R (Right)**: (2, 2) → (3, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Wall**: x=7 is the right wall. (3, 2) is within bounds.\n     - **Body**: Snake body is at (2, 1). (3, 2) is not part of the body.\n     - **Obstacle**: Internal obstacle is at (5, 2). No collision.\n   - **Food Check**: Is there food at (3, 2)?\n     - No food at (3,2).\n   - **Safe Move**: Yes.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, the primary goal is to move towards the nearest positive food while avoiding risks. \n\nLet's look at the food positions and their distances from the head (2, 2):\n\n1. (5, 3): Manhattan distance = |5-2| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n2. (5, 6): distance = |5-2| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n3. (3, 4): distance = |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n4. (5, 1): distance = |5-2| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nThe closest food is at (3, 4) with a distance of 3.\n\n### Path to Closest Food (3, 4)\n\nFrom (2, 2), to reach (3, 4):\n\n- Need to increase x by 1 and y by 2.\n- Possible sequence: \n  - First move: R to (3, 2)\n  - Then U to (3, 3)\n  - Then U to (3, 4)\n\nBut since we can only decide the immediate next move, we should choose R to start moving towards (3, 4).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake's tail is at (2, 1). The head is at (2, 2). \n\n- Adjacent cells to the tail (2,1):\n  - U: (2,2) - head is here\n  - D: (2,0) - wall (y=0 is a wall)\n  - L: (1,1)\n  - R: (3,1)\n\nIs there positive food on any adjacent cell to the tail?\n\nCurrent food positions:\n- (5,3), (5,6), (3,4), (5,1)\n\nAdjacent to tail:\n- (2,2): head - no food\n- (2,0): wall - no food\n- (1,1): no food\n- (3,1): no food\n\nNo food adjacent to tail, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\n### Verifying Other Moves\n\nWhile moving R seems good to reach (3,4), let's check if U or L could be better:\n\n- **Move U to (2,3)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (2,3): U, L, R (can't go D)\n  - To reach (3,4) from (2,3):\n    - R to (3,3), then U to (3,4) - same steps as from (2,2)\n    - Or U to (2,4), then R to (3,4)\n  - Not necessarily better than starting with R.\n\n- **Move L to (1,2)**:\n  - Moves away from (3,4), increasing distance.\n\nThus, R seems the most direct path towards the closest food.\n\n### Checking for Future Collisions\n\nAfter moving R to (3,2):\n- Snake positions: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,1)]\n- Next move towards (3,4) would be U to (3,3):\n  - Check if (3,3) is safe:\n    - Not a wall, not an obstacle, not part of the body (body will be at (2,2) and (2,1), moving to (3,2) and (2,2))\n    - Safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most promising immediate move is R (Right) to start heading towards the closest positive food at (3,4). \n\nOther moves (U or L) do not lead directly towards food and may delay reaching it. \n\nTherefore, the best action is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 7.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (3,2), body at (2,2).\n   - Current direction: Right (R). This means the snake was moving to the right to reach (3,2) from (2,2).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (5,3): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (5,6): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (3,4): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6,3): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,2) and direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,1)\n- **Left (L)**: (2,2) — but this is the current body segment, and since the tail will move away, this is technically possible unless it causes a collision.\n- **Right (R)**: (4,2)\n\nHowever, we cannot instantly reverse the direction. Since the current direction is R, the opposite is L, so we cannot move Left next. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: The body is at (2,2), so no collision.\n     - Walls: (3,3) is within bounds (x=0-7, y=0-7), no wall there.\n   - Food: Is there food at (3,3)? No.\n   - Next positions: Head moves to (3,3), body follows to (3,2). \n   - Future considerations: Moving up doesn't immediately eat food but is safe.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (3,1)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: (2,2), no collision.\n     - Walls: (3,1) is within bounds.\n   - Food: Is there food at (3,1)? No.\n   - Next positions: Head to (3,1), body to (3,2).\n   - Future considerations: Safe move, no immediate food.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,2)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: (2,2), no collision.\n     - Walls: (4,2) is within bounds, no wall.\n   - Food: Is there food at (4,2)? No.\n   - Next positions: Head to (4,2), body to (3,2).\n   - Future considerations: Safe move, no immediate food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see where the foods are and how we can reach them:\n\n- (5,3): From (3,2), to reach (5,3), we'd need to go Right twice then Up once or Up then Right twice, etc.\n- (5,6): Further away.\n- (3,4): Directly above (3,2), so Up twice.\n- (5,1): Below and to the right.\n- (6,3): To the right, three steps.\n\nCurrently, none of the foods are adjacent to the head, so we can't eat any this turn. We need to move towards the nearest food.\n\nThe closest foods seem to be:\n- (3,4): Manhattan distance = |3-3| + |4-2| = 2\n- (5,3): |5-3| + |3-2| = 3\n- (5,1): |5-3| + |1-2| = 3\n- (6,3): |6-3| + |3-2| = 4\n- (5,6): |5-3| + |6-2| = 6\n\nSo, (3,4) is the closest. To reach it:\n- Current: (3,2)\n- Next: Up to (3,3)\n- Then Up to (3,4) — can eat the food there.\n\nBut we can't eat it this turn, so let's move towards it.\n\n### Avoiding Obstacles\n\nThere's an obstacle at (5,2). Currently, our head is at (3,2), moving towards (5,3) would require passing near (5,2), but not directly into it.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nWe also need to ensure that moving towards food doesn't lead to a dead end or immediate collision in the next steps.\n\nFor example, if we go Up to (3,3), then next turn we can go Up to (3,4) to eat the food. After eating, the snake will grow, and the new tail will be at (3,2), but the head at (3,4), body at (3,3). Then we can move Left to (2,4), Right to (4,4), or Up to (3,5), etc., which seems safe.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food. Currently, the tail is at (2,2), and the head is at (3,2), so they are adjacent (left of head is tail). The tail cell is (2,2), is there food there? No, so no danger from this.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that (3,4) is the closest food and we can reach it in two moves (Up, then Up), the best immediate move is to start moving towards it by going Up to (3,3).\n\nOther options:\n- Down or Right don't bring us closer to any food immediately.\n- Left is not allowed (instant reverse from R to L).\n\n### Verifying Other Foods\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if any other food is reachable sooner:\n- (5,3): To reach it, we'd need to go Right twice then Up once, which is three moves.\n- (5,1): Right twice then Down once, three moves.\n- Others are further.\n\nSo, (3,4) is indeed the closest.\n\n### Final Check for Safety of Up Move\n\nMoving Up to (3,3):\n- Next turn, head at (3,3), body at (3,2).\n- Then can move Up to (3,4) to eat food.\n- After eating, snake grows: head at (3,4), body at (3,3), tail at (3,2).\n- Then possible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), D to (3,3) (but body is there, but tail is moving away), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n   - D would collide with body at (3,3), but the tail is at (3,2) and will move to (3,3), so head at (3,4) moving D to (3,3) would meet the new tail at (3,3) — this is a collision! So we must avoid moving Down after eating.\n   - So after eating at (3,4), we should move U, L, or R.\n\nThis seems manageable; we just need to plan not to move Down after eating.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up towards the closest food at (3,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**: (x, y) → (3, 5)\n   - New head position: (3, 5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall; 5 < 7, so no wall collision.\n     - Body: Current body is at (3,3) and (3,2). Moving to (3,5) doesn't overlap with body.\n     - Obstacle: No obstacle at (3,5).\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (3,5).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (x, y) → (2, 4)\n   - New head position: (2, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is the left wall; 2 > 0, so no wall collision.\n     - Body: (2,4) is not in body segments [(3,3), (3,2)].\n     - Obstacle: No obstacle at (2,4).\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (2,4).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (x, y) → (4, 4)\n   - New head position: (4, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is the right wall; 4 < 7, so no wall collision.\n     - Body: (4,4) is not in body segments.\n     - Obstacle: No obstacle at (4,4).\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (4,4).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNone of the immediate moves lead to food. However, we should consider future moves to reach food. Let's see where the foods are:\n\n1. (5, 3): To reach here from (3,4), possible path: Right to (4,4), then Right to (5,4), then Down to (5,3). But need to check if it's safe:\n   - (5,3) is adjacent to the current tail (3,2) is not directly adjacent, but let's see:\n   - Tail is at (3,2). After moving right to (4,4), body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)], tail is (3,3).\n   - Next move right to (5,4), body [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], tail is (3,4).\n   - Then down to (5,3): head at (5,3), body [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)], tail is (4,4).\n   - At this point, is (5,3) adjacent to tail? Tail is at (4,4), which is adjacent to (5,3) (diagonally adjacent, but adjacency in snake is usually 4-directional). Assuming 4-directional, they're not adjacent (left, right, up, down). So no tail reward danger.\n   - But life_span of (5,3) is 1, and we're at turn 9. Next turn is 10, so it disappears at turn 10 (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So at turn 9, it's still there, at turn 10 it's gone. So if we move right now, at turn 10 we can be at (5,4), then at turn 11 at (5,3), but food is gone by then. So cannot reach (5,3) in time.\n\n2. (5,6): From (3,4), path could be Up to (3,5), then Right to (4,5), then Right to (5,5), then Up to (5,6).\n   - Life_span is 1, so disappears at turn 10. Current turn is 9, so at turn 10 it's gone. Cannot reach in time.\n\n3. (5,1): Life_span is 5, so disappears at turn 14 (9 + 5). Possible to reach:\n   - From (3,4), could go Right to (4,4), then Right to (5,4), then Down to (5,3), then Down to (5,2) — but (5,2) is an obstacle. So cannot go down to (5,2). Alternative is after (5,4), go Down to (5,3), then Left to (4,3), then Down to (4,2), then Left to (3,2), then Down to (3,1), then Right to (4,1), then Right to (5,1). But this is too long, and snake would have moved by then. Probably not feasible in time.\n\n4. (6,3): Life_span is 8, so disappears at turn 17. Possible path:\n   - Right to (4,4), then Right to (5,4), then Right to (6,4), then Down to (6,3).\n   - Takes 4 moves, so can reach by turn 13, within life_span.\n   - Need to ensure no collisions during this path.\n\n### Deciding Immediate Action\n\nSince none of the immediate moves (U, L, R) lead to food, and some foods are about to disappear (turn 10), we can't reach them in time. The only food with enough life_span is (6,3), which we can reach in 4 moves.\n\nTo start moving towards (6,3), the first move should be Right (R) to (4,4). Then next moves would be Right to (5,4), Right to (6,4), Down to (6,3).\n\nAlternative is to go Up (U) to (3,5), but that doesn't help in reaching any food soon.\n\nLeft (L) to (2,4) also doesn't help in reaching food.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Right (R) to start heading towards (6,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nMoving Right to (4,4):\n- Not a wall.\n- Not a body segment.\n- Not an obstacle.\n- Safe move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (from (0,0) to (7,7)) since the borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — so the snake can't move to this cell.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,4), then (3,4), then (3,3).\n   - Current direction: Right (R). This means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,6): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (6,3): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6,1): value=1, life_span=10\n\nAll food items are positive (value=1), and their life spans indicate how many turns they'll remain before disappearing.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5,4)\n   - New head position: (5,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is the right border, so (5,4) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not in our path.\n     - Body collision: Current body segments are at (3,4) and (3,3). (5,4) is not touching any body segment.\n   - Food at (5,4)? No food listed at (5,4).\n   - After moving:\n     - Head moves to (5,4), body follows: new body segments at (4,4) and (3,4). The tail at (3,3) moves away, so length remains the same (no food eaten).\n   - **Outcome**: Safe move, no score change.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,5)\n   - New head position: (4,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the top border, (4,5) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not in our path.\n     - Body collision: (4,5) is not touching any body segment.\n   - Food at (4,5)? No food listed at (4,5).\n   - After moving:\n     - Head at (4,5), body at (4,4) and (3,4). Tail at (3,3) moves away.\n   - **Outcome**: Safe move, no score change.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,3)\n   - New head position: (4,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is the bottom border, (4,3) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not in our path.\n     - Body collision: Current body segments are at (3,4) and (3,3). (4,3) is adjacent to (3,3), but is it the same cell? No, (4,3) is one unit right of (3,3), so no collision.\n   - Food at (4,3)? No food listed at (4,3).\n   - After moving:\n     - Head at (4,3), body at (4,4) and (3,4). Tail at (3,3) moves away.\n   - **Outcome**: Safe move, no score change.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move and if it's safe to eat:\n\n1. **Food at (5,6)**:\n   - Distance from head (4,4): Need to move right to (5,4), then up to (5,5), then up to (5,6). Not reachable in one move.\n   \n2. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Distance: From (4,4), need to move right to (5,4), then down three times to (5,1). Not reachable in one move.\n   \n3. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - Distance: From (4,4), move right to (5,4), then right to (6,4), then down to (6,3). Not reachable in one move.\n   \n4. **Food at (6,1)**:\n   - Similar to above, not reachable in one move.\n\nNone of the food items are directly adjacent to the head, so we can't eat any food in the immediate next move. Therefore, our priority is to move safely towards potential food in future moves.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nEven though no food is immediately accessible, let's think about which move might position us better to reach food soon:\n\n- **Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (5,4): U, D, R (can't go left, reverse of right).\n  - From (5,4), moving up can get us closer to (5,6), moving right to (6,4) can get us closer to (6,3) or (6,1).\n  \n- **Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n  - Moves us away from most food which is at lower y-coordinates.\n  \n- **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n  - Moves us closer to y=1 where some food is, but still not directly helpful.\n\nMoving Right seems the most promising as it opens paths towards multiple food items in the next moves.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail is at (3,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4).\n- Head is at (4,4), which is adjacent to (3,4) (part of the body, not tail) and (4,3), (5,4), (4,5).\n- The tail is at (3,3), and its adjacent cells are checked above. The head is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1: from (4,4) to (3,3) is diagonal, distance sqrt(2) > 1).\n  \nSo, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven all possible moves are safe and none allow eating food immediately, moving Right seems the best as it positions the snake closer to multiple food items without immediate risks.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However, since the snake is currently moving Right (R), it cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next turn. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Right (R) - (6, 4)\n- New head position: (6, 4).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (6,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body segments: Current body is at (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).

No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move from the current head position (5,4):\n\n1. (5,1): To reach this in one move, we'd need to move Down three times, which isn't possible.\n2. (6,3): To reach this in one move from (5,4), we'd need to move Right to (6,4) and then Down to (6,3) next turn.\n   - But we can't plan two moves ahead; we're only deciding the immediate next move.\n3. (6,1): Similarly, this is two moves away (Right to (6,4), then Down twice).\n\nNone of the food can be eaten in the immediate next move. \n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (3,4). The head is at (5,4), so the tail is two cells to the left. Adjacent positions to the tail would be (2,4), (4,4), (3,5), (3,3). Our head is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to the tail. Also, the tail doesn't have any food on it (food is at (5,1), (6,3), (6,1)), so no danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll possible moves (U, D, R) are safe and don't lead to immediate food. Since we're moving Right, continuing Right seems reasonable unless there's a reason to turn. \n\nHowever, moving Right takes us to (6,4), and next turn we could move Down to (6,3) to eat the food there (value +1). \n\nAlternatively, moving Up or Down doesn't immediately help in reaching food, but keeps options open. \n\nGiven that moving Right is safe and positions us to potentially eat the food at (6,3) next turn, that seems like the best immediate move.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is Right (R), so we cannot move Left (L). We're not considering Left, so no issue.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to continue moving Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Yes, there's food with value=1, life_span=5.\n  - Check if eating is safe:\n    - Current tail is at (4,4).

Head at (6,3), tail at (4,4):\n      - Distance: |6-4| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent means distance=1).\n    - So no immediate collision from tail.\n- Outcome: Safe move, eat positive food (+1 score, length increases by 1).\n\n#### Option 3: Left (L) to (5, 4) — Not allowed\n- Current direction is R, opposite is L, so cannot instantly reverse.\n- Even if allowed, (5,4) is the next body segment, so unless the tail moves away, this would collide.\n- Tail is at (4,4), after move tail would be at (5,4) (since the snake moves forward), so head and new tail would both be at (5,4) — collision.\n- So definitely not allowed and unsafe.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, no food.\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, eat positive food.\n  \nDown seems better as it increases the score without risking collision.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail where the tail has positive food?\n- Current tail is at (4,4). Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5).\n- Head is at (6,4), so adjacent to head are:\n  - (5,4), (7,4), (6,3), (6,5).\n- Overlap in adjacent cells: (5,4).\n- Is there food at (5,4)? No, food is at (5,1), (6,3), (6,1).\n- So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Verifying Food at (6,3)\n\n- Position: (6,3)\n- Value: 1 (positive)\n- Life span: 5\n- Current turn: 12, so it will disappear at turn 12 + 5 = 17.\n- No issue with lifespan currently.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and D, D is better as it allows eating positive food safely. Moving U is safe but doesn't gain anything.\n\n### Possible Oversights\n\nWait, let me double-check the tail movement after eating:\n- Current snake: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n- Move D to (6,3), eat food (length increases by 1):\n  - New snake: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n  - Tail was at (4,4), now new tail is at (5,4)?\nWait no, when snake grows, the tail stays where it is (since a new segment is added at the head).\nWait, the rules say \"Length of snake +1\", which implies the tail doesn't move when eating.\nBut typically in Snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move in the next step, so the snake grows by not removing the last segment.\nSo after moving D to (6,3) and eating:\n- New positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n- Tail is at (4,4), which was the previous tail, now second to last.\n- Next move, tail would move to (5,4), but that's after this move.\nSo no collision from tail now.\n\nBut is the head adjacent to any part of the body after this move?\n- Head at (6,3), body at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4).\n- Adjacent to head: (5,3), (7,3), (6,2), (6,4).\n- (6,4) is part of the body, so head is adjacent to body at (6,4).\nWait, is that a problem? The rules say body collision is deadly if head touches any body segment.\nAfter moving to (6,3), the head is at (6,3), and the next segment is at (6,4), which is adjacent.\nBut is that a collision? The head is adjacent to the body, but not overlapping unless it moves onto it.\nWait, the collision happens if the head moves into a body segment's cell, not just adjacent.\nCurrently, moving to (6,3), which is not occupied by any body segment (body is at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)).\nAdjacency is not collision; collision is occupying the same cell.\nSo no collision here.\n\n### Re-evaluating Down Move\n\nAfter moving D to (6,3):\n- Head at (6,3), body at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4).\n- Next move, if we don't eat, tail moves to (5,4), head moves somewhere.\nBut currently, no collision from moving to (6,3).\n\n### Checking Other Food\n\nIs there any other food that might be better?\n- (5,1): To reach this, need to go left then down, but current direction is R, cannot instantly reverse to L.\n- (6,1): To reach, need to go down twice, but first down is to (6,3), then next could be to (6,2), but (6,2) is not a wall but no food there, then to (6,1).\nBut current move is only one step, so can't plan multiple steps ahead as a non-thinking executor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBest immediate action is to move Down (D) to (6,3) to eat the positive food there safely.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n**Snake**:\n- Head at (6, 3)\n- Body segments in order: (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)\n- Current direction: Down (D)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5, 1): value = 1, life_span = 2\n2. (6, 1): value = 1, life_span = 7\n3. (2, 2): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\nAll food items are positive (value = +1).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) on the next move. So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (6, 2)\n- Check for walls: y=2 is not a border (borders are y=0 and y=7), and (6,2) is not an internal obstacle (only obstacle is at (5,2)).\n- Check for body collision: The body segments are at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4). (6,2) is not in this list.\n- Valid move.\n- Food at (6,2)? No food there.\n- Next positions: Head moves to (6,2), body follows: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). Tail at (4,4) is removed.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5, 3)\n- Check for walls: x=5 is not a border, and (5,3) is not an internal obstacle (obstacle is at (5,2)).\n- Check for body collision: (5,3) is not in [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)].\n- Valid move.\n- Food at (5,3)? No.\n- Next positions: Head at (5,3), body: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). Tail at (4,4) is removed.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7, 3)\n- Check for walls: x=7 is a border wall.\n- Invalid move (would collide with wall).\n\nSo, possible valid moves are D and L.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Based on Food\n\nNow, let's see which move gets us closer to food or sets up for future food collection.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n1. (5,1): life_span = 2 (will disappear after 2 more turns, including current)\n2. (6,1): life_span = 7\n3. (2,2): life_span = 10\n\n**Move D to (6,2)**:\n- Distance to (5,1): Manhattan distance = |6-5| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Distance to (6,1): |6-6| + |2-1| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- Distance to (2,2): |6-2| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nFrom (6,2), the closest food is (6,1) at distance 1 (directly below). Next move could be D to (6,1) to eat it, but:\n- After moving D to (6,2), next move to (6,1) would be D again.\n- Eating (6,1): head moves to (6,1), body grows to include (6,2), so new body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4).\n- Check for tail reward danger: tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to head at (6,1). Safe to eat.\n\n**Move L to (5,3)**:\n- Distance to (5,1): |5-5| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- Distance to (6,1): |5-6| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Distance to (2,2): |5-2| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nFrom (5,3), the closest food is (5,1) at distance 2 (two moves down). To reach it:\n- Next move would need to be D to (5,2), but (5,2) is an obstacle! So cannot go directly down.\n- Alternative path: L to (4,3), then D to (4,2), etc., but this is longer and not straightforward.\n\nThus, moving L doesn't provide a clear path to immediate food, whereas moving D sets up to eat (6,1) next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there food adjacent to the current head position (6,3)?\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- U (6,4): body segment\n- D (6,2): no food\n- L (5,3): no food\n- R (7,3): wall\n\nNo immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nAfter moving D to (6,2), next move is likely D to (6,1) to eat food. Then the snake grows, and the body will be longer, but no immediate collision risks.\n\nMoving L to (5,3) doesn't lead to immediate food and may complicate future paths due to the obstacle at (5,2).\n\n### Life Span Considerations\n\n(5,1) has life_span = 2, meaning it disappears after this turn and next (i.e., after turn 14). To eat it, we'd need to reach it by turn 14. From (6,3), it's two moves away (L then D), but D is blocked by obstacle at (5,2). So cannot eat (5,1) in time.\n\n(6,1) is safe with life_span = 7, and we can reach it in two turns (D to (6,2), then D to (6,1)).\n\n(2,2) is too far and not urgent.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move D to (6,2), setting up to eat (6,1) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 14  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: There's a wall at (5, 2).  \n**Snake Positions**:  \n- Head: (6, 2)  \n- Body: (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)  \n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D).  \n**Food Available**:  \n1. (5, 1): value = 1, life_span = 1  \n2. (6, 1): value = 1, life_span = 6  \n3. (2, 2): value = 1, life_span = 9  \n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me sketch the snake's position relative to the food and walls:\n\n```\ny=7: -----------------\n...\ny=4: |   |   |   |   |   | B |   |   |  B at (5,4), (6,4)\ny=3: |   |   |   |   |   |   | B |   |  B at (6,3)\ny=2: |   |   | F |   | W |   | H |   |  F at (2,2), W at (5,2), H at (6,2)\ny=1: |   | F |   |   | F |   |   |   |  F at (5,1) and (6,1)\ny=0: -----------------\nx=0 1   2   3   4   5   6   7\n```\n\n- H: Head at (6, 2)\n- B: Body segments\n- F: Food\n- W: Wall at (5, 2)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake is currently moving Down (D), so its head is at (6, 2). From here, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6, 3) - But this is where the body is at (6, 3). Moving here would collide with the body immediately after the tail moves, but let's check:\n   - After moving, the new head is at (6, 3), and the tail (currently at (5, 4)) moves to (6, 4), so the body becomes [(6,3), (6,2), (6,3)] - wait, no, original body is (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). After moving U to (6,3), the body becomes [(6,3), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)], but the tail moves from (5,4) to (6,4), so the new body is [(6,3), (6,2), (6,3)]. Wait, this seems confusing. Maybe better to think: original body is (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). After moving U to (6,3), the new body is (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail moves from (5,4) to (6,4). So head at (6,3), body (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). There's a collision because head is at (6,3) and body has (6,3). So this is invalid (collision).\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (6, 1) - This is a food position with value +1 and life_span 6.\n   - Check if eating this is safe:\n     - Current tail is at (5, 4). After eating, the tail doesn't move (since length increases by 1), so new tail is (6,4).\n     - New head is at (6,1), body is [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4)].\n     - No immediate collision.\n     - Also, check \"Tail Reward Danger\": is the head adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food?\n       - Tail is at (6,4), head is at (6,1) - not adjacent (distance is 3 in y), so safe.\n   - Also, no wall at (6,1).\n   - So moving D to (6,1) seems safe and gets +1 score.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (5, 2) - This is a wall, so cannot move here.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (7, 2) - Check borders: x=7 is a border wall, so cannot move here.\n\n### Checking Other Food Options\n\nIs there any other food we can reach safely?\n\n- (5,1): value +1, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn).\n  - To reach (5,1) from (6,2), possible path: \n    - Current direction is D, cannot instantly reverse to U (but we're not moving U anyway).\n    - To go left to (5,2) is wall, so cannot.\n    - Only way is to go D to (6,1), then next turn can go L to (5,1), but that's next turn and food will disappear by then.\n  - So cannot reach (5,1) this turn.\n\n- (2,2): value +1, life_span 9.\n  - Far away, not reachable in one move.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nFrom possible moves:\n- U: leads to collision.\n- D: safe, gets +1 food.\n- L: wall.\n- R: wall.\n\nOnly valid move is D to (6,1), which is safe and gets food.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough: after moving D to (6,1):\n- New head: (6,1)\n- Body: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]\n- Tail is at (6,4)\n- Is head adjacent to tail? (6,1) and (6,4) - no, they are 3 apart in y.\n- Does tail have positive food? No, tail is at (6,4), no food there.\nSo no danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and beneficial move is Down (D) to (6,1) to eat the positive food there.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (6,1), followed by segments at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail at (5,4).\n   - Current direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item at (2, 2) with value = 9 and life_span = 1.\n     - Value is positive (+9), so it's positive food.\n     - Life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is D, the snake cannot move U next (that would be instant reverse).\n  \nSo, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - Current head: (6,1). Down would be (6,0).\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall. So, moving D would hit the wall → deadly collision.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - Current head: (6,1). Left would be (5,1).\n   - Check walls: x=5 is not a wall (only x=0 and x=7 are walls).\n   - Check internal obstacles: (5,2) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (5,1) → no collision.\n   - Check snake body:\n     - Snake body segments: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4).\n     - (5,1) is not in the body → no collision.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - After moving, the new head is at (5,1), and the tail moves forward, so the new body is [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)].\n     - The tail was at (5,4), which moves away, so if there was food there, it could be eaten next turn, but currently, there's no food there.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**:\n   - Current head: (6,1). Right would be (7,1).\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall → deadly collision.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\nSo, the only valid move is Left (L).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Left allows us to eat the food:\n- Food is at (2,2). Moving left takes us to (5,1), which is not the food location.\n- The food is at (2,2) with life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n- Currently, the head is at (6,1), and the food is at (2,2). Even if we move left to (5,1), we're still not close to the food.\n- The food is too far to reach in this turn, so we cannot eat it now.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nSince the food is at (2,2) and will disappear after this turn, we cannot eat it. Therefore, our immediate goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- In our current state:\n  - Tail is at (5,4).\n  - Head is at (6,1). Adjacent cells to the tail are (4,4), (6,4), (5,3), (5,5).\n  - Head is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1).\n  - So, this rule doesn't affect us now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Left (L). Moving Down or Right would result in a collision with the wall, and moving Up is not allowed (instant reverse from Down).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but we cannot reverse direction instantly (i.e., cannot go Right (R) immediately after Left (L)).\n\nSo, possible moves from current direction (L):\n- Left (L): continue left.\n- Up (U): turn up.\n- Down (D): turn down.\n\nCannot go Right (R) because that's the opposite of Left.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L):\n   - Current head: (5,1).\n   - Move left: (4,1).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (4,1) is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (4,1), which is clear.\n     - Body collision: Snake body segments are at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,1) is not in these.\n     - Tail is at (6,4), moving to (6,3) next turn, so no collision with tail.\n   - Food at (4,1)? No food there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U):\n   - Current head: (5,1).\n   - Move up: (5,2).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is max, (5,2) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is an obstacle! Cannot move here.\n   - Outcome: Illegal move (hits obstacle).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D):\n   - Current head: (5,1).\n   - Move down: (5,0).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall. (5,0) is on the wall.\n   - Outcome: Illegal move (hits wall).\n\n### Available Moves\n\nFrom the above:\n- Left (L): Safe, no food.\n- Up (U): Hits obstacle.\n- Down (D): Hits wall.\n  \nSo, the only legal move is Left (L).\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake's Body\n\nThe food positions are:\n- (2,2): not under snake.\n- (3,2): not under snake.\n\nNo food is under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n- Tail is at (6,4).\n- Head is at (5,1). Distance is |5-6| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Food Life Span\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But we can't reach them in one move:\n- To reach (2,2): from (5,1), need at least 3 moves left and 1 up.\n- To reach (3,2): from (5,1), need at least 2 moves left and 1 up.\n\nSo, we can't eat them this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and legal move is Left (L). Moving left doesn't eat any food this turn, but it's the only option to avoid collision.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(4,2) is not in this list — safe.\n2. **Check for Food**:\n   - No food at (4,2).\n3. **Future Implications**:\n   - Moving up doesn't eat any food, just moves the snake.\n   - The tail is at (6,3). After moving, the tail moves to (5,1), so no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n#### Move Left (L) to (3,1)\n\n1. **Check for Collisions**:\n   - Walls: (3,1) is not a wall.\n   - Body: (3,1) is not in the body segments — safe.\n2. **Check for Food**:\n   - No food at (3,1).\n3. **Future Implications**:\n   - Moving left doesn't eat any food.\n   - The tail moves to (5,1), no immediate danger.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nBoth food items are positive and will disappear next turn (life_span=1). They are at:\n- (2,2): To reach this, from (4,1), need to go U then L or L then U.\n- (3,2): From (4,1), can go U to (4,2), then L to (3,2).\n\nBut we're only deciding the immediate move at t=17. \n\n- To eventually reach (3,2), first move should be U to (4,2), then next turn can go L to (3,2).\n- To reach (2,2), first move could be L to (3,1), then next turn U to (3,2), then L to (2,2). But this takes two more moves, and food disappears after this turn.\n\nWait, no: both foods have life_span=1 at t=17, so at t=18 they disappear. So we can't reach them in time unless we can eat them at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, head is at (4,1). Neither (2,2) nor (3,2) is adjacent to (4,1):\n- Adjacent to (4,1): (4,0) wall, (4,2), (3,1), (5,1) body.\nSo cannot eat any food this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail is adjacent to the head and has positive food:\n- Tail is at (6,3).\n- Adjacent to head (4,1)? \n  - (6,3) is not adjacent to (4,1) (distance is |6-4| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4, not 1).\n  - Adjacent cells to head: (4,2), (3,1), (5,1).\n  - None of these are the tail, so no danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nAt t=17:\n- Can move U or L.\n- Neither move eats food this turn.\n- Both moves are safe in terms of collisions.\n- Moving U to (4,2) sets up to possibly eat (3,2) next turn if it weren't disappearing.\nBut since food disappears next turn, and we can't reach it this turn, it's irrelevant.\n\nBetween U and L:\n- Moving U might be better to explore upper areas where food is, but both foods are disappearing.\n- Moving L keeps the snake moving left, but no immediate benefit.\n\nSince both moves are equally safe and neither leads to food this turn, either is acceptable. But moving U might be slightly better as it moves towards where food was, possibly opening more space.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body:\n- After moving U to (4,2), body becomes [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] — tail is at (6,2).\n- After moving L to (3,1), body becomes [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] — tail is at (6,2).\n\nNo significant difference. \n\nGiven that, and since the snake was moving left, continuing left (L) maintains direction unless there's a reason to turn. \n\nBut since both are safe and no immediate food, and no clear advantage, I'll choose to move Up to explore more space.\n\nWait, actually, moving Left might be better because moving Up could lead to being trapped near the top wall in future turns, whereas Left opens more space on the left side where there's no immediate obstacle.\n\nBut the internal obstacle is at (5,2), which is not blocking left moves.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems safer to keep options open.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering both options, moving Left (L) seems slightly better to maintain direction and avoid potential future traps near walls.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 18  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — this is a single cell that's blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]  \nThis means:\n- Head at (3, 1)\n- Body segments at (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)\n- Tail is at (6, 2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nSo, the snake was moving left to reach (3,1) from (4,1).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2, 2): value = 1, life_span = 6\n2. (3, 2): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (3,1), current direction is Left (L). The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but we cannot reverse direction instantly. Since the snake was moving left (from (4,1) to (3,1)), the opposite direction is Right (R), which is not allowed next. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: Move to (2,1)\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a wall, but (2,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - Snake body is at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). (2,1) is not in these.\n   - Safe move.\n   - No food at (2,1).\n   - Outcome: Just move left, no score change.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (3,2)\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is wall, but (3,2) is within bounds.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not (3,2), so safe.\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - (3,2) is not in [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)].\n   - Food at (3,2): value=1, life_span=8.\n     - Can eat this food.\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: \n       - Adjacent to tail: tail is at (6,2). Distance from (3,2) to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3, not adjacent (adjacent means distance=1).\n       - So, no danger.\n   - Outcome: Eat positive food, score +1, length increases by 1.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (3,0)\n   - Check for walls: y=0 is a wall, and (3,0) is on y=0.\n   - So, this is a wall collision — deadly.\n   - Not a valid move.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nWe have two food items:\n1. (2,2): Not reachable this turn (would require moving left then up next turn).\n2. (3,2): Reachable this turn by moving up.\n\nEating (3,2) is beneficial:\n- Positive food: +1 score, length +1.\n- No immediate danger from tail.\n- After eating, new head at (3,2), body extends to include old head (3,1), etc.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving left to (2,1):\n- Safe but no immediate benefit.\n- Next turn, could consider moving up to (2,2) to eat the other food, but that's future planning which we're not doing here.\n\nMoving up to (3,2):\n- Immediate +1 score.\n- Need to ensure that after growth, the new tail doesn't cause a collision next turn.\n  - Current tail is at (6,2). After eating, new tail is the old tail (since length increases by 1, the tail doesn't move forward this turn).\n  - So, next turn, tail will be at (6,1) (since the segment before tail was (6,1), which moves to where tail was).\n  - Head at (3,2), next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body which will be [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] — but that's future consideration.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (Left and Up), Up gives an immediate score increase without apparent danger. Left is safe but doesn't provide immediate benefit.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving Up to (3,2):\n- New snake positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n- Length is now 6.\n- Next turn, tail moves from (6,2) to (6,1), but that's not relevant now.\n\nNo immediate collision or danger from this move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the positive food at (3,2).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. These are the edges of the grid.\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2). This is a single cell that the snake cannot move into.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nThe snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n1. Head: (2, 2)\n2. Next: (3, 2)\n3. Then: (3, 1)\n4. Then: (4, 1)\n5. Then: (5, 1)\n6. Then: (6, 1)\n7. Tail: (6, 2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). This means the last move was from (3,2) to (2,2).\n\n**Food**:\nThere's one piece of food at (4, 1) with:\n- Value: 9 (this seems unusually high; typically, food values are +1 or -1. Assuming this is a positive food with a value of +1 and the '9' is a typo or miscount in the life span. Alternatively, if the value is indeed 9, it's extremely high, but given the format says \"value\" and \"life_span\", and the example shows \"value1, life_span1\", it's likely that the food at (4,1) has a value of 9 and a life span of 1. But since positive food is usually +1, this might be a mistake. For the sake of proceeding, I'll assume it's a positive food with value +1 and life span 9, but the given is (4, 1, 9, 1), so value=9, life_span=1. This seems unusual, but we'll proceed with value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's plot the snake and food on the grid for clarity.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (2,2)\n  - Body segments at (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n  \n- Food at (4,1) with value=9, life_span=1.\n\nWait a minute, the food is at (4,1), and the snake has a body segment at (4,1). This means the food is under the snake's body. According to the rules:\n\n- Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the food is under the snake at (4,1), which is the 4th segment (counting from head=1). So, the segment at (4,1) is part of the body, not the tail. \n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L), so its head is at (2,2), last move was from (3,2) to (2,2). \n\nPossible moves from (2,2) without reversing (cannot go Right, since that would be opposite of Left):\n- Up (U): (2,3)\n- Down (D): (2,1)\n- Left (L): (1,2)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,3)**:\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (2,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - Snake body is at (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). (2,3) is not in these.\n   - Safe move.\n   - No food at (2,3).\n\n2. **Down (D) to (2,1)**:\n   - Check for walls: y=0 is the lower wall, (2,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (2,1) is not in the body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n   - No food at (2,1).\n\n3. **Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is the left wall, (1,2) is not x=0, so safe.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (1,2) is not in the body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n   - No food at (1,2).\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe food is at (4,1) with life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\nCan we eat it? \n\nCurrently, the food is under the snake's body at (4,1). To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (4,1).\n2. The head must move onto (4,1).\n\nThe body moves when the snake moves forward. The tail is at (6,2), and the segment before is (6,1). \n\nIf the snake moves, the tail will move forward, but the segment at (4,1) is not the tail; it's in the middle. So moving the snake won't immediately free up (4,1). \n\nTo free (4,1), the snake would have to move in a way that the segment at (4,1) is no longer occupied after the move. But since the snake is long (length 7), moving one step won't free (4,1) unless it's the tail, which it's not.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (4,1) this turn because the body cannot move away from it in one move (it's not the tail).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's also a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (6,2).\n- Head is at (2,2). Distance is |6-2| + |2-2| = 4, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\nSo this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (U, D, L) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body. None of them can eat the food at (4,1) this turn, and there's no other food on the grid.\n\nGiven that, we can choose any of them. But since the food at (4,1) will disappear after this turn (life_span=1), and we can't eat it, we might as well choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it for future food.\n\nLooking at the snake's current path, it's moving left. Continuing left seems reasonable unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nLet's check if any move leads to a dead end or limits future options:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n   - Next turn, from (1,2), cannot go Right (reverse), so options would be U, D, L.\n   - Going L again would take us to (0,2), which is x=0 (wall), so invalid.\n   - So next turn would have to choose between U or D.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (2,3)**:\n   - From (2,3), cannot go D (reverse), so options U, L, R.\n   - U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n3. **Down (D) to (2,1)**:\n   - From (2,1), cannot go U (reverse), so options D, L, R.\n   - D to (2,0) is y=0 (wall), so invalid.\n   - So options L to (1,1), R to (3,1).\n\nGoing Left seems slightly more limiting next turn (only U or D), whereas Up or Down keep more options open. Between Up and Down:\n\n- Up to (2,3): next can go U, L, R.\n- Down to (2,1): next can go L, R.\n\nUp seems better for keeping options open.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that all moves are safe and we can't eat the food this turn, and Up keeps more options open for the next move, I'll choose Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 21.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move outside these borders.\n   - Internal obstacle at (5, 2). The snake can't move here.\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)].\n     - Head at (2, 3).\n     - Tail at (6, 1).\n   - Current direction: Up (U). This means the last move was upwards.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item: (4, 1, 8, 1).\n     - Position: (4, 1).\n     - Value: 8 (positive food, so +1 score and length increases by 1).\n     - Life span: 1. This means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (2, 3), possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). But we must consider:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Last move was U, so can't move D this turn.\n- **Wall collisions**: Check if moving in a direction hits a wall or obstacle.\n- **Body collisions**: Check if moving in a direction hits the snake's body (except the tail, which moves away).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2, 3) → (2, 4)\n   - Check walls: y=7 is border, but (2,4) is within bounds.\n   - Check obstacles: No internal obstacle at (2,4).\n   - Check body: \n     - Snake body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n     - (2,4) is not in body segments. Safe.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (2, 3) → (2, 2)\n   - Instant reverse from U to D? Last move was U, so D is opposite. **Not allowed**.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (2, 3) → (1, 3)\n   - Walls: x=0 is border, but (1,3) is within bounds.\n   - Obstacles: No obstacle at (1,3).\n   - Body: (1,3) not in body segments.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n   - Walls: x=7 is border, (3,3) is within bounds.\n   - Obstacles: No obstacle at (3,3).\n   - Body: (3,3) not in body segments.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nThere's food at (4,1) with value 8, life span 1 (will disappear after this turn).\n\nCurrent head is at (2,3). Distance to food:\n- Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\nCan't reach it in one move, so can't eat it this turn. So, food is not immediately accessible.\n\nBut let's check if the food is under the snake's body:\n- Food at (4,1). Snake body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n- Yes, (4,1) is occupied by the snake's body (5th segment from head).\n\n**Special Case for Food Under Body**:\n- Can only eat if:\n  1. Body moves away from (4,1).\n  2. Head moves onto (4,1).\n\nCurrently, the segment at (4,1) is followed by (5,1), so if the tail moves forward, (4,1) will be vacated next turn. But since the food's life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so we can't eat it next turn either. Hence, this food is effectively not eatable.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food:\n- Tail is at (6,1).\n- Head is at (2,3). Distance: |6-2| + |1-3| = 4 + 2 = 6. Not adjacent.\n- So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince we can't eat the food this turn, our goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning for future food.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's see where each leads:\n\n1. **U (Up)**: (2,3) → (2,4)\n   - New head: (2,4).\n   - Body follows: [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n   - Next turn, can't reverse to D.\n   - Opens up space, moves away from walls.\n\n2. **L (Left)**: (2,3) → (1,3)\n   - New head: (1,3).\n   - Body: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n   - Moves towards the left wall (x=0), which might limit future moves.\n\n3. **R (Right)**: (2,3) → (3,3)\n   - New head: (3,3).\n   - Body: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n   - Moves towards the center, more options next turn.\n\nBetween U, L, R:\n- U moves up, away from the long body stretch to the right.\n- L moves towards the left wall, limiting space.\n- R moves towards the center, but the body is to the left and down, so might be okay.\n\n**Potential Issue with R**:\nLooking at the body after R:\nHead at (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), etc.\nNext move from (3,3), possible directions:\n- Can't reverse to L (since moved R).\n- U: (3,4) - check body: no.\n- D: (3,2) - body at (3,2) - collision.\n- R: (4,3) - no body.\nSo next turn after R, only U and R are safe, D is collision.\n\n**Potential Issue with U**:\nAfter U to (2,4):\nNext move from (2,4), can't reverse to D.\n- U: (2,5) - safe.\n- L: (1,4) - safe.\n- R: (3,4) - safe.\nMore options next turn.\n\n**Potential Issue with L**:\nAfter L to (1,3):\nNext move from (1,3), can't reverse to R.\n- U: (1,4) - safe.\n- D: (1,2) - safe (but body at (2,2), not (1,2)).\n- L: (0,3) - wall, invalid.\nSo next turn, U or D.\n\n**Decision**:\nU seems best as it opens up more options next turn without boxing us in.\n\n### Verifying Safety of U\n\nMove U to (2,4):\nNew positions:\nHead: (2,4)\nBody: [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\nCheck for collisions:\n- (2,4) not in rest of body: (2,3), (2,2), etc. - no.\n- Not hitting walls or obstacles.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBest immediate action is to move Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n   - Current head direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (4, 1): value = 7, life_span = 1.\n   - (4, 4): value = 10, life_span = 1.\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,4), moving Up (U). From the current direction, the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (2,5)\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (1,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (3,4)\n\nCannot move Down (D) because that's the opposite of the current direction (U), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (2,5)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top wall; (2,5) is within bounds.\n  - Body segments: The snake's body is at [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]. (2,5) is not in this list → safe.\n- Food at (2,5)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Moves to (2,5), no food eaten, snake length remains the same.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1,4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is the left wall; (1,4) is within bounds.\n  - Body segments: (1,4) is not in the body list → safe.\n- Food at (1,4)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Moves to (1,4), no food eaten, snake length remains the same.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3,4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall; (3,4) is within bounds.\n  - Body segments: (3,4) is not in the body list → safe.\n- Food at (3,4)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Moves to (3,4), no food eaten, snake length remains the same.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions:\n\n1. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Current value: 7 (positive).\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn).\n   - Position: (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body segment (4,1) (6th segment in the list).\n   - To eat this food:\n     - The body must move away from (4,1), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the head is at (2,4); moving directly to (4,1) in one move is impossible (would require moving diagonally, which isn't allowed).\n     - So, cannot eat this food this turn.\n\n2. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Current value: 10 (positive).\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn).\n   - Position: (4,4) is not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Distance from head (2,4) to (4,4): need to move right twice (from (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4)).\n   - Can't reach it in one move, so can't eat it this turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (5,1). Is there positive food adjacent to the head where the tail is?\n\n- Head is at (2,4), tail at (5,1). They are not adjacent (distance is more than 1 in both x and y).\n- So, no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Potential Moves Revisited\n\nGiven that we can't eat any food this turn (since both foods are out of reach in one move and one is under the body), the best move is to avoid collisions and position ourselves for future food.\n\nPossible moves:\n- U: (2,5)\n- L: (1,4)\n- R: (3,4)\n\nAll are safe. Which one is better strategically?\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (2,5):\n  - Next moves could be towards the food at (4,4) if it respawns, but it's disappearing this turn.\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,4):\n  - Moves towards the left wall, limiting future options.\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,4):\n  - Moves towards the center, more options for future moves.\n\nBetween U and R, both are safe. Moving Right seems slightly better as it keeps more options open.\n\n### Considering Future Food\n\nBoth foods will disappear after this turn (life_span=1). So next turn, new food may spawn. Moving towards the center (Right) gives more flexibility to reach new food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Right (R)** seems the most reasonable choice as it keeps the snake in a more central position with more future movement options, and all immediate moves are safe with no food to eat this turn.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to take at Turn 23.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: It's an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — the snake can't move here.\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head: (3, 4)\n   - Body segments: (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)\n   - So the snake is 7 units long.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n5. **Food**:\n   - (4, 1): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - (4, 4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Head at (3, 4), moving Right (R).\n- Next possible moves from (3, 4):\n  - Up (U): (3, 5)\n  - Down (D): (3, 3)\n  - Left (L): (2, 4) — but this is the first body segment, and moving left would reverse the current right direction, which is not allowed.\n  - Right (R): (4, 4) — this is where one of the food items is.\n\nFood:\n- (4, 1): This is actually the current tail position of the snake (last segment). It has food with value 6, life_span 1.\n- (4, 4): value 9, life_span 1.\n\n### Possible Moves and Their Consequences\n\nFrom the head at (3, 4), moving Right (R):\n\n1. **Right (R) to (4, 4)**:\n   - (4, 4) has food with value 9.\n   - Eating this food would increase the snake's length by 1 (from 7 to 8), and the score by 9.\n   - Need to check if this move is safe:\n     - Is (4, 4) occupied by any body part? Currently, the body is at (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). (4,4) is not in the body, so no collision.\n     - Is (4, 4) a wall? No, walls are at borders and (5,2).\n     - So moving right is safe and leads to eating positive food.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (3, 5)**:\n   - (3, 5) is not a wall (y=7 is wall, y=5 is fine).\n   - Is (3, 5) in the body? No.\n   - No food here, so just move without eating.\n   - Safe but doesn't gain points.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (3, 3)**:\n   - (3, 3) is not a wall.\n   - Is (3, 3) in the body? Checking the body segments: (2,3) is at x=2, so (3,3) is free.\n   - No food here.\n   - Safe but no points.\n\n4. **Left (L) to (2, 4)**:\n   - This is the first body segment, so moving left would collide with the body.\n   - Also, current direction is Right, so moving Left is the opposite direction, which is not allowed.\n   - So Left is invalid.\n\n### Considering the Food at (4, 1)\n\nThe food at (4, 1) is under the snake's tail. Rules say:\n- Food under body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away (tail moves when snake moves forward).\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4, 1) with food. If the snake moves such that the tail moves away, then in the next step, the head could move to (4,1) to eat it. But:\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (3,4), tail at (4,1). Are they adjacent?\n- Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.\n- (3,4) and (4,1): x differs by 1, y differs by 3 — not adjacent (need one coordinate to differ by 1 and the other by 0).\nSo they're not adjacent now, but if we move in a way that brings them adjacent, it could be dangerous.\n\nBut currently, the food at (4,1) is not immediately eatable because the head isn't on it, and the tail is on it. To eat it, we'd have to move the tail away first, then move the head onto it next turn. But its life_span is 1, so next turn it will disappear (since countdown decreases every turn, including current). So we can't eat (4,1) — it will disappear before we can.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven the above:\n\n- Right (R) to (4,4): eat food with value 9, safe.\n- Up (U) or Down (D): safe but no points.\n- Left (L): invalid.\n\nSo the best immediate action is to move Right to eat the high-value food at (4,4).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Moving Right\n\nAfter moving Right to (4,4):\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n- New body: adds (3,4) at the front, so body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] — but since we ate food, length increases by 1, so tail stays at (4,1) (doesn't move).\nWait, no: when snake eats food, the tail doesn't move, so the new body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] — length 8.\n\nNow, is there any danger in the next move? \n\nNext turn, head is at (4,4), direction is R (since we moved R now). Possible moves:\n- U: (4,5)\n- D: (4,3)\n- L: (3,4) — but this is the first body segment now, and opposite of R is L, which is not allowed.\n- R: (5,4) — is this safe? (5,4) is not a wall (walls are x=0,7; y=0,7; and (5,2)). Is (5,4) in body? No. So R is safe next turn if we choose.\n\nBut we don't need to plan that far; just ensuring current move is safe.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail after moving Right?\n\nHead: (4,4)\nTail: (4,1)\nAre they adjacent? x same, y differs by 3 — no, not adjacent (must differ by 1 in one coordinate and 0 in other).\n\nSo no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right to eat the high-value food at (4,4), which is safe and maximizes the score.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail:\n     - Head: (4, 4)\n     - Body segments: (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the **Right (R)**. This means the last move was to the right, so the head moved from (3,4) to (4,4).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There's one piece of food at (4, 1) with a value of 1 (positive food) and a life span of 5 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to better understand its position and possible movements:\n\n- Head at (4,4)\n- Next segment at (3,4)\n- Then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) (tail)\n\nThe food is at (4,1), which is currently occupied by the snake's tail. \n\n### Movement Constraints\n\nGiven the current direction is Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Right (R)**: From (4,4) to (5,4)\n   - Check if (5,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not 0 or 7, y=4 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not an internal wall: (5,2) is not (5,4).\n     - Not part of the snake's body: The body segments are at (3,4), (2,4), etc., not (5,4).\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: From (4,4) to (4,5)\n   - Check (4,5):\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not 0 or 7, y=5 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not an internal wall: (5,2) is not (4,5).\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Checking all body segments, none are at (4,5).\n     - Valid move.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: From (4,4) to (4,3)\n   - Check (4,3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an internal wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: The body is at (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), etc., not (4,3).\n     - Valid move.\n\n4. **Reverse Left (L)**: From (4,4) to (3,4)\n   - This would be the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\" rule).\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves from current position: R, U, D.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThe food is at (4,1) with value +1 and life span 5. Currently, it's under the snake's tail at (4,1). \n\nTo eat this food:\n- The tail must move away from (4,1), and then the head must move onto (4,1).\n- Currently, the tail is at (4,1), and the segment before it is at (3,1). Next move, the tail will move to (3,1), freeing up (4,1).\n- Then, the head would need to move to (4,1) in a subsequent move to eat the food.\n\nHowever, the food's life span is 5 turns. It will disappear after 5 more turns (including the current turn). So, we have until turn 28 for the food to be eaten.\n\nBut more critically, the food is under the tail. For the head to reach (4,1), it would take several moves. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head at (4,4). To reach (4,1), one possible path is:\n- Down to (4,3)\n- Down to (4,2)\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nBut:\n- After first down to (4,3), tail moves to (3,1), freeing (4,1).\n- Then down to (4,2), tail moves to (3,1) (no change in tail position since the segment before tail is at (3,2) moves to (3,1), tail moves to (3,2)).\n- Then down to (4,1), which is now free (since tail was at (3,2) and moves to (3,1), freeing (4,1)).\n\nBut wait, the tail's movement is more complex. Let's track the tail's position over moves:\n\nInitial tail: (4,1)\nAfter move 1: tail moves to (3,1) (since the segment before is (3,1) moves to where (3,2) was, but actually, the tail is the last segment, so it moves forward based on the body's movement. It's better to simulate the entire snake's movement.\n\nActually, simulating the entire snake's movement over several steps is complex without a visual aid. Instead, let's consider that to eat the food at (4,1), the head must eventually reach (4,1), and the tail must have moved away from (4,1) by then.\n\nGiven the current position, moving down seems to be a step towards (4,1). However, moving right or up doesn't directly help in reaching (4,1).\n\nBut moving down to (4,3) is safe, and then next moves can continue down towards the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nWe must ensure that the next move doesn't lead to a collision or a dead end.\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (5,4):\n     - Right to (6,4) - but then the snake is moving towards the right wall (x=7), which may limit future moves.\n     - Up to (5,5) or Down to (5,3) - both seem safe for now.\n   - No immediate collision.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - Moves the head upwards, away from the food.\n   - Next possible moves could be left or right or up, but not down (reverse).\n   - Not directly helpful for reaching the food.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - Moves towards the food at (4,1).\n   - Next possible moves could be left, right, or down.\n   - Seems like a step towards the food without immediate danger.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4,1), and the head is at (4,4). They are not adjacent (distance is 3 in y-coordinate). So this rule doesn't apply now.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Down (D) is a step towards the food at (4,1).\n- Moving Down is safe (no walls or body collisions).\n- The food is positive and will disappear in 5 turns, so we have some time to reach it.\n- Moving Right or Up doesn't directly help in reaching the food and may lead to less optimal paths.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Down (D)** towards the food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So, the snake cannot move to (5, 2).\n\n2. **Snake's Current Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]\n     - Head is at (4, 3).\n     - Next segment is (4, 4), then (3, 4), and so on until the tail at (3, 1).\n   - Current head direction: Down (D).

So, U is invalid.\n- **Wall collisions**:\n  - Moving Down to (4, 2): y=2 is not a wall (y=0 is the wall), so valid.\n  - Moving Left to (3, 3): x=3 is not a wall, y=3 is not a wall, and (3, 3) is not an internal obstacle (only (5,2) is), so valid.\n  - Moving Right to (5, 3): x=5 is not a wall (x=7 is), y=3 is not a wall, and (5, 3) is not an obstacle (only (5,2) is), so valid.\n- **Body collisions**:\n  - Moving Down to (4, 2): Check if (4, 2) is in the snake's body.\n    - Snake body segments after head: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1). (4,2) is not in this list, so safe.\n  - Moving Left to (3, 3): Check if (3, 3) is in the body.\n    - (3,3) is not in the body segments listed, so safe.\n  - Moving Right to (5, 3): Check if (5, 3) is in the body.\n    - (5,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see where the foods are and if we can reach them safely.\n\n1. **Food at (4, 1)**:\n   - Current position: (4, 3).\n   - To reach (4,1), we'd need to move Down twice: (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1).\n   - First move Down to (4,2) is valid.\n   - Then next move would be Down to (4,1), but need to ensure that's safe then.\n   - However, we're only deciding the immediate next move, not planning ahead.\n   - Also, the food's life_span is 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns (including this one), so it's available for turns 25, 26, 27, 28.\n\n2. **Food at (3, 6)**:\n   - Current position: (4, 3).\n   - To reach (3,6), we'd need to move Left to (3,3), then Up to (3,4), then Up to (3,5), then Up to (3,6).\n   - That's multiple moves away, and the food's life_span is 10, so it's available for turns 25 to 34.\n   - It's further away, so less immediate.\n\n### Immediate Food Considerations\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately in the next move?\n\n- The head is at (4,3). Adjacent cells:\n  - Up: (4,4) - this is the second segment of the snake, so moving here would collide with the body (deadly).\n  - Down: (4,2) - no food here.\n  - Left: (3,3) - no food here.\n  - Right: (5,3) - no food here.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten in the immediate next move. We have to plan to move towards food.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if moving in a certain direction could lead to a situation where the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, which would kill the snake if eaten next.\n\nCurrent tail is at (3,1). Adjacent to tail:\n- (2,1), (4,1), (3,0), (3,2).\n   - (3,0) is a wall (y=0).\n   - (2,1): not in snake body, no info on food (but no food listed there).\n   - (4,1): has positive food (value +1).\n   - (3,2): is part of the snake's body.\n\nSo, if the head moves to be adjacent to (4,1), and then tries to eat the food at (4,1), it would be dangerous because:\n- After eating, the tail grows by one, so the new tail would be where the old tail was (3,1), and the head would be at (4,1), adjacent to (3,1), causing a collision.\n\nBut currently, the head is at (4,3). To be adjacent to (4,1), the head would need to be at (4,2), which is adjacent to (4,1) below it.\n\nSo, if we move Down to (4,2), then next turn if we move Down to (4,1) to eat the food, that would be dangerous because:\n- After eating at (4,1), the tail grows, so the new tail is at (3,1), which is adjacent to the head at (4,1), causing a collision.\n\nTherefore, moving Down now could lead to a dangerous situation next turn if we decide to eat the food at (4,1).\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that moving Down could lead to a dangerous situation with the food at (4,1), and the other foods are not immediately accessible, let's consider the other options:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (3,3)**:\n   - Moves towards the center.\n   - Next possible moves from (3,3):\n     - Up to (3,4): but (3,4) is part of the body (second segment is (4,4), then (3,4)), so would collide.\n     - Down to (3,2): (3,2) is part of the body (later segment), so would collide.\n     - Left to (2,3): (2,3) is part of the body.\n     - Right to (4,3): original head position, now empty.\n   - So from (3,3), only Right is safe, which would be backtracking.\n\n   This seems like a dead end, not leading towards food.\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (5,3)**:\n   - Moves towards the right side.\n   - Next possible moves from (5,3):\n     - Up to (5,4): check if safe.\n       - (5,4) is not in body, not a wall, not an obstacle.\n     - Down to (5,2): (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so cannot.\n     - Left to (4,3): original head position, now empty.\n     - Right to (6,3): not a wall.\n   - So from (5,3), can go Up, Left, or Right.\n   - Moving Right could help explore more space.\n\nBetween L and R, R seems better as it opens up more options next turn.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,2)**:\n   - As discussed, could lead to danger with food at (4,1).\n   - But if we don't eat the food next turn, it's okay.\n   - However, the food's life_span is 4, so it's\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

Down to (4,1) - food.\n2. Left to (3,2) - tail.\n3. Right to (5,2) - wall (invalid).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Move Down to (4,1)**:\n- (4,1) is positive food (value = 1).\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be at (3,2) (since the tail moves forward).\n- New head at (4,1), new tail at (3,2).\n- Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail after eating?\n  - Head at (4,1), tail at (3,2): They are diagonally adjacent (not directly adjacent horizontally or vertically). So no immediate collision.\n- However, the next move after eating would have the head at (4,1), and the tail would have moved from (3,2) to ... but the tail is at (3,2), and the segment before is (2,2). So the new tail would be (2,2), and the head is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to (2,2).\n- So no Tail Reward Danger here.\n- Also, no collision with body or walls.\n- This seems safe.\n\n**Move Left to (3,2)**:\n- (3,2) is the current tail.\n- Moving into the tail is generally safe because the tail will move away.\n- After moving left, the head is at (3,2), and the tail moves from (3,2) to (2,2), so the new tail is (2,2).\n- No growth since no food is eaten.\n- Check for collisions: head at (3,2), body segments are [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] - no overlap with head.\n- This is also safe, but doesn't give any score.\n\n**Move Right to (5,2)**:\n- (5,2) is a wall - invalid move.\n\n### Comparing the Options\n\n- **Down (D)**: Eat positive food, gain +1 score, snake grows, no immediate danger.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe but no score.\n- **Right (R)**: Invalid (wall).\n\nBetween Down and Left, Down is better because it increases the score.\n\n### Checking for Potential Future Dangers After Down\n\nAfter moving Down to (4,1):\n- New snake positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n  - Wait, the tail was at (3,2), and the segment before was (2,2), so the new tail is (2,2), and the new body is [(4,1), (4,2), ..., (3,2)].\n- Next possible moves from (4,1):\n  - Current direction is Down (D), so cannot move Up (U).\n  - Left (L) to (3,1): Check if (3,1) is free.\n    - (3,1) is not listed as a wall or part of the snake's body (current body is from (4,2) onwards).\n    - So (3,1) is free.\n  - Right (R) to (5,1): Check if (5,1) is free.\n    - Not a wall, not in the body - free.\n  - Down (D) to (4,0): y=0 is a wall - invalid.\n  \nSo from (4,1), can move Left or Right next turn, which seems safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the positive food at (4,1), as it safely increases the score without causing any immediate or obvious future collisions.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 27 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)].\n     - Head is at (4,1), direction is Down (D).\n   - The snake's body forms a sort of \"S\" shape starting from the head at (4,1) going down to (4,4), then left to (3,4), (2,4), up to (2,3), (2,2), and then right to (3,2).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food item at (3,6) with value = 8 and life_span = 1.\n     - Value is positive (+1), so it's good food.\n     - Life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nCurrent head direction is Down (D). From the head at (4,1), moving Down would go to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid (collision).\n\n**No instant reverse rule**: Since the current direction is Down, we cannot move Up next (that would be instant reverse). So, possible moves are Left (L), Right (R), or Down (D) if valid.\n\nBut Down is invalid (wall), so options are Left or Right.\n\n- Left (L): from (4,1) to (3,1).\n  - Check if (3,1) is occupied by snake body or is a wall.\n    - Snake body positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2).\n    - (3,1) is not in the body list.\n    - Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2). (3,1) is not a wall.\n    - So, Left is valid.\n\n- Right (R): from (4,1) to (5,1).\n  - Check (5,1):\n    - Not in snake body.\n    - Walls: x=5 is not a border wall, and (5,2) is an obstacle but we're at (5,1), which is not listed as a wall.\n    - So, Right is also valid.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Based on Food\n\nThere's food at (3,6) with value +1, life_span 1 (will disappear after this turn).\n\n- Distance to food:\n  - Current head: (4,1).\n  - Food: (3,6).\n  - Manhattan distance: |4-3| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6.\n  - It's quite far; we can't reach it in one move.\n\nSince the food is at (3,6) and we're at (4,1), neither moving Left to (3,1) nor Right to (5,1) gets us closer to the food in a way that we can reach it soon. Also, the food will disappear after this turn, so it's not reachable now.\n\n### Avoiding Collisions and Maximizing Future Options\n\nSince we can't get the food this turn, our goal is to avoid collisions and position ourselves for future food.\n\n**Left to (3,1)**:\n- Next possible moves from (3,1):\n  - Current direction would be Left (since we moved Left).\n  - Cannot move Right (instant reverse).\n  - Can move Up (to (3,2)), Down (to (3,0)), or continue Left (to (2,1)).\n    - (3,2): part of snake body (tail is at (3,2)), but the tail will move when the head moves, so it's safe unless we're growing.\n    - (3,0): y=0 is wall.\n    - (2,1): not occupied by body or walls.\n  - So, from (3,1), we'd have options to go Up or Left next turn.\n\n**Right to (5,1)**:\n- Next possible moves from (5,1):\n  - Current direction would be Right.\n  - Cannot move Left.\n  - Can move Up (to (5,2)), Down (to (5,0)), or Right (to (6,1)).\n    - (5,2): internal obstacle, can't go there.\n    - (5,0): y=0 is wall.\n    - (6,1): not occupied by body or walls (x=7 is wall but x=6 is fine).\n  - So, from (5,1), only Right to (6,1) is valid next turn.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Left to (3,1) gives more options next turn (Up or Left).\n- Right to (5,1) gives only one option next turn (Right).\n\nLeft seems better for keeping options open.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left to (3,1)?\n- (3,1) is not part of the body or walls.\n- Tail is at (3,2), which is adjacent to (3,1) (Up from (3,1)).\n  - But tail will move when head moves, so unless we're growing, it's safe.\n  - We're not eating food this turn, so length stays the same, tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, moving Right to (5,1) is also safe.\n\n### Considering Future Food\n\nNo other food is present, and the current food is unreachable and will disappear.

The head is at (3,1), moving left, and the tail is at (2,2).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). From the rules, we cannot instantly reverse direction, so we cannot move Right (opposite of Left). So possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (2,1)\n2. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3,2)\n3. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3,0)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (2,1)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall. (2,1) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (2,1) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body positions (excluding head): [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]\n    - (2,1) is not in the body → safe.\n- Food: Is there food at (2,1)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,2)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top wall. (3,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Is (3,2) in the body?\n    - Looking at body segments: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc. (3,2) is not in the list → safe.\n- Food: Is there food at (3,2)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,0)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall. (3,0) is on y=0 → wall collision → deadly.\n- Outcome: Not safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if we can aim for it in future moves.\n\n- Food at (3,6): value = +1, life_span = 7\n- Food at (4,5): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\nBoth foods are positive, so we'd like to eat them if possible. But currently, neither is adjacent to the head (3,1):\n\n- Distance to (3,6): 5 units up (y difference)\n- Distance to (4,5): 1 right, 4 up\n\nNot immediately accessible. So immediate moves don't lead to food.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail having food and the head being adjacent to the tail. Let's check:\n\n- Tail is at (2,2).\n- Is there food at (2,2)? No (food is at (3,6) and (4,5)).\n- So no danger from tail reward in this case.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (Left and Up), neither leads to food immediately. So we can choose either, but we should think about future moves.\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (2,1)**:\n  - Next moves from (2,1): can't go Right (reverse), so Up or Down or continue Left.\n  - Left to (1,1): possible, but then we're moving towards the wall at x=0.\n  - Up to (2,2): but (2,2) is the tail, which will move away, so safe unless tail has food (it doesn't).\n  - Down to (2,0): y=0 is wall, so not safe.\n  \n- **Move Up (U) to (3,2)**:\n  - Next moves from (3,2): can't go Down (reverse), so Left, Right, or Up.\n  - Left to (2,2): tail is at (2,2), but will move to (2,3) next turn, so safe.\n  - Right to (4,2): but (4,2) is part of the body (second segment after head) → collision.\n  - Up to (3,3): check if (3,3) is in body: no, safe.\n\nMoving Up seems better because it gives more options next turn without leading towards a wall immediately.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Accessibility\n\nWait, is any food accessible in one move? No, as previously determined. But let's see if moving Up can help us reach food in future moves.\n\nFrom (3,2), next move could be Up to (3,3), then (3,4), etc., towards (3,6) where food is. That seems like a path towards food.\n\nAlternatively, moving Left to (2,1) doesn't seem to lead towards food quickly.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Up, moving Up seems more promising for future food access without immediate risks.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Food Items:**\n- **Food at (3, 6):** Value = 1, Life Span = 6\n- **Food at (4, 5):** Value = 1, Life Span = 9\n\nBoth foods are positive (+1 reward, length increases by 1).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 2) moving Up (U), the next possible directions are:\n- **Continue Up (U):** (3, 3)\n- **Turn Left (L):** (2, 2)\n- **Turn Right (R):** (4, 2)\n  \nCannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (U), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (3, 3)\n- Check if (3, 3) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: \n    - x=3 is not 0 or 7, y=3 is not 0 or 7.\n    - Not the internal obstacle (5, 2).\n  - Not part of the snake body:\n    - Current body segments: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3)\n    - (3,3) is not in this list.\n  - Safe to move here.\n  \n- After moving:\n  - New head: (3, 3)\n  - Tail (last segment) (2,3) will move away, so the body will be: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n  \n- Is there food at (3,3)? No, only at (3,6) and (4,5).\n  \n- Future considerations:\n  - Moving Up gets us closer to the food at (3,6), which is at y=6, currently at y=2, so 4 steps away in y-direction.\n  \n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (2, 2)\n- Check if (2, 2) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=2, y=2 are within bounds, not (5,2).\n  - Not part of the snake body:\n    - Body segments don't include (2,2).\n  - Safe to move here.\n  \n- After moving:\n  - New head: (2, 2)\n  - Tail moves away, body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n  \n- Food at (2,2)? No.\n  \n- Future considerations:\n  - Moves away from both foods currently. Not ideal unless it's part of a longer path.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (4, 2)\n- Check if (4, 2) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=4, y=2 are within bounds, not (5,2).\n  - Part of the snake body:\n    - Current body segments include (4,2).\n    - However, (4,2) is the 4th segment (0-indexed: head is 0, then 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2)).\n    - The tail is at (2,3), which will move away, so the segment at (4,2) will shift to (4,1), and (4,2) will be the new head's position.\n    - But the rule says: \"the head can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n    - Here, (4,2) is not the tail; it's a body segment. Moving into a body segment other than the tail is a collision.\n    - Therefore, moving to (4,2) would collide with the body at (4,2), which is deadly.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Moving Right is invalid due to body collision.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nFrom the above, valid moves are:\n- Up (U) to (3,3)\n- Left (L) to (2,2)\n\nNow, let's decide which is better based on food proximity and potential paths.\n\n**Food Positions:**\n1. (3,6): To reach this, need to move upwards. Current y=2, food at y=6, so need to move up 4 times.\n   - Next move Up gets to (3,3), then can continue up to (3,4), but (3,4) is part of the body currently.\n     - At turn 29: body has (3,4) at position 6 (0-indexed).\n     - After moving Up to (3,3), the body becomes: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n     - Next move to (3,4): (3,4) is now the tail (since the tail was at (2,3), now moves to (2,4), and the previous tail was (2,4) which moves away).\n     - So moving to (3,4) is safe because it's the tail, and the tail moves away.\n   - Then can go to (3,5), then (3,6) to eat the food.\n   - Seems like a viable path.\n\n2. (4,5): Current head at (3,2), food at (4,5).\n   - Need to move right then up.\n   - Next move Right is invalid (collision), so would need to go Up first, then maybe right.\n   - After Up to (3,3), then Right to (4,3), then Up to (4,4), but (4,4) is body currently (will be at position 5 after first move).\n     - At turn 29: body has (4,4) at position 5.\n     - After first move Up: (4,4) is position 6.\n     - Moving to (4,3) is safe (not body after first move), then to (4,4) is body, but it's not the tail (tail is at (2,4)), so collision.\n   - Alternative path: Up to (3,3), Right to (4,3), Right to (5,3) - but (5,3) is adjacent to wall at x=7, but not directly a wall.\n     - Then Up to (5,4), but internal wall at (5,2), so (5,4) is safe.\n     - Then Left to (4,4) - but (4,4) is body, collision.\n   - Seems more convoluted to reach (4,5) safely.\n\n**Left Move to (2,2):**\n- Moves away from both foods.\n- Unless it's part of a circling strategy, seems less optimal for immediate food collection.\n\n**Potential Danger: Tail Reward Danger**\n- Check if any food is adjacent to the tail and is positive.\n- Tail is at (2,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\n  - (2,4) is part of the body (position 8 in current body).\n  - Foods are at (3,6) and (4,5) - not adjacent to tail.\n- No immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe most straightforward path is to move Up towards the food at (3,6). Moving Left doesn't seem to offer a better immediate advantage, and moving Right is invalid due to collision.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 30 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Snake Positions:**\nThe snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n- Head: (3, 3)\n- Body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]\n\nThis means the snake's head is at (3, 3), and the tail is at (2, 4). The snake is currently moving in the \"U\" (Up) direction, which means its next move would naturally be upwards unless we decide otherwise.\n\n**2. Walls and Obstacles:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the snake cannot go outside these bounds.\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2). This is a single cell that's blocked.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\nThere are two pieces of food:\n1. At (3, 6) with a value of +1 and life span of 5.\n2. At (4, 5) with a value of +1 and life span of 8.\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating either would increase the snake's length by 1 and score by 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 3) and direction \"U\", the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3, 4)\n- **Left (L)**: (2, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (4, 3)\n\nWe cannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction \"U\", which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (3, 4):**\n- Current snake body includes (3, 4) as the 7th segment (counting from 0: head is 0, next is 1, etc.).\n- Moving to (3, 4) would mean the head collides with the body segment at (3, 4), which is deadly unless it's the tail.\n- The tail is at (2, 4), not (3, 4), so (3, 4) is a body segment that's not the tail. Hence, this is a collision → deadly.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move Up.\n\n**2. Move Left (L) to (2, 3):**\n- Check if (2, 3) is a wall or obstacle:\n  - Border walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=2 is not.\n  - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) is not at (2, 3).\n- Check if (2, 3) is part of the snake's body:\n  - Snake body positions: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]\n  - (2, 3) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- Check for food at (2, 3):\n  - Food is at (3, 6) and (4, 5), not at (2, 3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (4, 3):**\n- Check if (4, 3) is a wall or obstacle:\n  - Border walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=4 is not.\n  - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) is not at (4, 3).\n- Check if (4, 3) is part of the snake's body:\n  - Snake body includes (4, 3) as the 5th segment.\n  - The tail is at (2, 4), so (4, 3) is a body segment that's not the tail → collision → deadly.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move Right.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a danger:\n\n1. Food at (3, 6):\n   - Current head at (3, 3). To reach (3, 6), need to move Up three times.\n   - Next move Up to (3, 4) is deadly as we saw.\n   - So, cannot go towards (3, 6) directly.\n\n2. Food at (4, 5):\n   - Current head at (3, 3). To reach (4, 5), possible path: Right to (4, 3), then Up to (4, 4), then Up to (4, 5).\n   - But moving Right to (4, 3) is deadly as it's a body segment.\n   - Alternative: Up to (3, 4) is deadly, Left to (2, 3) is safe but away from food, Right to (4, 3) is deadly.\n   - So, cannot reach (4, 5) in the next move.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger**:\nCheck if the tail is adjacent to the head and has positive food:\n- Tail is at (2, 4).\n- Adjacent cells to head (3, 3): (3, 4), (2, 3), (4, 3), (3, 2).\n- Tail is at (2, 4), which is diagonally adjacent, not directly adjacent (does not share a side).\n- So, no tail reward danger in this case.\n\n### Available Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only safe move is **Left (L) to (2, 3)**. Moving Up or Right leads to collision with the body.\n\n### Verifying Left Move\n\nAfter moving Left to (2, 3):\n- New head position: (2, 3)\n- New body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4)]\n- Tail was at (2, 4), which moves to (3, 4) (since the second last segment was (3, 4), but actually, the tail movement depends on the entire body movement. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nOriginal body: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\nAfter moving Left:\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Body shifts: (3,3) becomes first body segment, (3,2) second, ..., and the last segment (2,4) is removed (since the snake doesn't grow in this move).\nSo new body: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)]\nTail is now at (3,4).\n\nThis seems correct, and no collisions occur with this move.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food After Move\n\nAfter moving to (2, 3), is there any food there? No, as per the given food positions.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nWhile moving Left is safe now, it's moving away from both food items. However, given the current constraints, it's the only viable option to avoid immediate death. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n- Up: Deadly (collision with body at (3,4))\n- Right: Deadly (collision with body at (4,3))\n- Left: Safe (no collision, no food)\n- Down: Not allowed (opposite of current direction \"U\")\n\nTherefore, the only safe action is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 31 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, any move that would take the snake to these coordinates is a wall collision.\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- Current positions (head first): [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4)]\n  - Head: (2, 3)\n  - Next segment: (3, 3)\n  - Tail: (3, 4)\n- Current direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left to reach (2, 3) from (3, 3).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n  1. (3, 6): value = +1, life_span = 4\n  2. (4, 5): value = +1, life_span = 7\n  3. (2, 1): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\nAll foods are positive, so no negative food to avoid.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately. Current direction is Left (L), so cannot move Right (R) next.\n- Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L).\n\n**Current Head Position: (2, 3)**\n- Left (L): (1, 3)\n- Up (U): (2, 4)\n- Down (D): (2, 2)\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n- Check for walls: x=0 is a wall, (1, 3) is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body segments: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)\n  - (1, 3) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (1, 3)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Moves to (1, 3), no food eaten, snake length remains the same.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2, 4)\n- Check for walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (2,4) is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (2,4) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (2, 4)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Moves to (2, 4), no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2, 2)\n- Check for walls: y=0 is the lower wall, (2,2) is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Body segments: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)\n  - (2,2) is not in the body.\n- Food at (2, 2)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Moves to (2, 2), no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nAll possible moves don't directly lead to food. However, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we might want to approach.\n\nCurrent head: (2, 3)\nAdjacent cells:\n- Left: (1, 3) - no food\n- Right: (3, 3) - body segment, can't go there (reverse is prohibited anyway)\n- Up: (2, 4) - no food\n- Down: (2, 2) - no food\n\nNearest foods:\n1. (3, 6) - distance: |3-2| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. (4, 5) - distance: |4-2| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n3. (2, 1) - distance: |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nClosest food is at (2, 1), which is 2 units away (directly below the head). Currently at (2,3), next is (2,2), then (2,1).\n\nBut moving Down to (2,2) doesn't immediately eat food, but sets up to reach (2,1) next.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the newly grown tail will collide with the head.\n\nCurrent tail: (3, 4)\nIs head adjacent to tail?\nAdjacent cells to head (2,3):\n- (1,3), (3,3), (2,4), (2,2)\nTail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (2,3) (it's diagonally adjacent, but in Snake, adjacency is up/down/left/right). So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Life Span of Foods\n\nAll foods have sufficient life spans (4, 7, 10), and we're at turn 31, so no immediate risk of food disappearing next turn.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nCurrent options:\n- Left (L): (1,3) - safe, no food\n- Up (U): (2,4) - safe, no food\n- Down (D): (2,2) - safe, no food, but moves towards closest food at (2,1)\n\nMoving Down seems the best as it moves towards the closest food, setting up to eat it next turn if no new obstacles appear.\n\nOther moves don't lead towards any food directly.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Move Down\n\nIf we move Down to (2,2):\nNext turn, head is at (2,2), direction is Down.\nPossible moves then:\n- Cannot reverse (cannot go Up)\n- Can go Left, Right, Down\nFood at (2,1) is directly below (2,2), so can move Down to (2,1) to eat it, unless something blocks.\n\nBut need to ensure that after eating, the new tail (which is the current tail moved forward) doesn't collide with the head.\n\nCurrent tail is (3,4). After moving to (2,2), tail moves forward from (3,4) to where? The body is:\nOriginal body: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)]\nAfter moving head to (2,2), tail (3,4) is removed, new body:\n[(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\nNext move to (2,1) to eat food at (2,1):\nNew head: (2,1), body grows by 1:\n[(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\nNew tail is (4,4). Head is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to (4,4), so safe.\n\nThus, moving Down now is safe and sets up to eat the closest food next turn.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any immediate danger in other moves?\n- Left to (1,3): safe, but not progressing towards food.\n- Up to (2,4): safe, but not towards food.\nDown is the only move that progresses towards food without immediate risk.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Down (D) to position (2, 2), setting up to reach the closest food at (2, 1) in the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So, the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and anything on these edges is a wall.\n- Internal obstacle: (5,2).

It means you cannot move in the direction opposite to the current head direction. Current head direction is Down (D), so opposite is Up (U). So, cannot move Up next. \n\nAllowed moves: Left (L), Right (R), Down (D).\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move based on:\n- Does it cause a collision (with wall or body)?\n- Does it lead to food?\n- Any other risks?\n\n**Current Head Position**: (2,2)\n\n1. **Move Left (L)**: (x-1,y) → (1,2)\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but (1,2) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Snake body segments are at (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (1,2) is not in this list.\n   - Check food: No food at (1,2).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Right (R)**: (x+1,y) → (3,2)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is border, (3,2) is not a wall. Internal obstacle is at (5,2), so (3,2) is clear.\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc. (3,2) is the 4th segment (counting head as 1st). \n     - The tail is at (4,4), which will move forward when the head moves, so the current (3,2) is not the tail. Actually, the tail is the last segment that will move away, but (3,2) is not the tail. Wait, let's see:\n     - Snake body after head: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So (3,2) is the 4th segment (after head). The tail is at (4,4), which will move to (4,3) when the head moves, but (3,2) is not the tail, so moving to (3,2) would collide with the body.\n   - So, moving Right to (3,2) would collide with the body segment at (3,2). Not safe.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**: (x,y-1) → (2,1)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, (2,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (2,3), (3,3), etc. (2,1) is not in the body.\n   - Check food: There is food at (2,1) with value=9, life_span=1.\n     - Eating this food: \n       - Value: +9 (high reward).\n       - Length increases by 1.\n       - Need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\": Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is the tail cell positive food?\n         - Tail is at (4,4). Head is at (2,2), moving to (2,1). Distance from (2,1) to (4,4) is more than adjacent (Manhattan distance is |2-4| + |1-4| = 2+3=5), so not adjacent.\n         - So no tail reward danger.\n   - Safe move with high reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nThere are three foods, all with life_span=1, so they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n1. (3,6): value=3\n   - To reach this, need to go Right then Up multiple steps. Not reachable in one move.\n2. (4,5): value=6\n   - To reach this, need to go Right then Up multiple steps. Not reachable in one move.\n3. (2,1): value=9\n   - Directly reachable by moving Down this turn.\n\nOther moves (Left or Right) don't lead to food immediately, and Right leads to collision. So Down is the only safe move that also gets food.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving Down to (2,1) to eat the food:\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be where the current tail is (4,4), but since we're adding a segment at the head, the tail doesn't move until the next move.\n- Next moves after this would need to avoid colliding with the longer body, but that's for future turns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to (2,1) to eat the high-value food (value=9) before it disappears, and this move is safe (no collisions).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at turn \\( t_0 = 33 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these borders.\n   - Internal obstacle at (5, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n     - Head is at (2,1).\n     - Tail is at (4,4).\n   - Current direction: Down (D). This means the last move was from (2,2) to (2,1).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (3, 6): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - (4, 5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,1) with direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1,1)\n- **Right (R)**: (3,1)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,0) — but y=0 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,2) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so it's a collision.\n\nWait, the current direction is D, meaning the snake was moving down. The rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. The opposite of D is U. So moving U is not allowed because it would be reversing direction instantly.\n\nSo valid moves from (2,1) with current direction D are:\n- L: (1,1)\n- R: (3,1)\n\nD is invalid (wall), U is invalid (reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's check L and R:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1,1)**:\n   - Check if (1,1) is occupied by body:\n     - Snake body: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n     - (1,1) is not in the body, so no collision.\n   - Check if (1,1) is a wall:\n     - x=1 is not a border wall (borders are x=0,7), and no internal obstacle at (1,1).\n   - Safe move.\n   - Is there food at (1,1)? No, food is at (3,6) and (4,5).\n   - This move doesn't eat any food, just moves the snake safely.\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (3,1)**:\n   - Check if (3,1) is occupied by body:\n     - (3,1) is in the body (6th position in the list).\n     - So moving here would collide with the body.\n   - This move is deadly.\n\nSo, the only safe move is Left to (1,1).\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nIs there any food we can reach soon that we should consider?\n\nFood at:\n- (3,6): value 2, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn)\n- (4,5): value 5, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn)\n\nCurrently at (2,1), moving left to (1,1) doesn't get us closer to either food. The foods are at higher y-coordinates (6 and 5), and we're at y=1. It would take several moves to reach them, and they'll disappear after this turn, so we can't reach them in time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\nTail is at (4,4). Head is at (2,1). They are not adjacent (distance is |2-4| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5), so no danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Left (L) to (1,1).

So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)].\n     - Head is at (1, 1).\n     - Tail is at (4, 3).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (\"L\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three food items:\n     1.

(2, 3): value = 1, life_span = 10\n     - All foods have a positive value (+1), so no negative food is present in this state.\n\n### Snake's Current Movement Constraints\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (\"L\"), which means its head is at (1, 1) moving towards (0, 1). However, x=0 is a wall, so moving Left would cause a wall collision, which is deadly. Therefore, the snake cannot continue moving Left in the next turn.\n\n**No Instant Reverse Rule**: Since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot immediately move Right (\"R\") in the next turn. So, possible moves are Up (\"U\"), Down (\"D\"), or Left (\"L\")—but Left leads to a wall, so effectively, only Up or Down are viable.\n\n### Possible Moves from (1, 1):\n\nFrom (1, 1), the possible moves are:\n- Up (\"U\"): (1, 2)\n- Down (\"D\"): (1, 0) — but y=0 is a wall, so Down is invalid.\n- Left (\"L\"): (0, 1) — x=0 is a wall, invalid.\n- Right (\"R\"): (2, 1) — but this is the opposite of current direction (Left), so it's not allowed.\n\nSo, the only possible move is Up (\"U\") to (1, 2).\n\nBut wait, let's check if (1, 2) is occupied by the snake's body.\n\n### Checking for Body Collisions\n\nThe snake's body segments are:\n- (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)\n\n(1, 2) is not in this list, so moving Up to (1, 2) is safe from body collision.\n\n### Checking for Food at (1, 2)\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (3, 6), (4, 5), (2, 3)\n\n(1, 2) is not a food position, so no food will be eaten by moving there.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently:\n- Tail is at (4, 3).\n- Head is at (1, 1).\n- Adjacent cells to head (1,1) are:\n  - (0,1) — wall\n  - (2,1) — body segment\n  - (1,0) — wall\n  - (1,2) — empty\n\nThe tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to the head (distance is more than 1 in both x and y). So, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nEven though we're forced to move Up due to constraints, let's see if any food is reachable soon to plan ahead, but since we're a non-thinking executor, we only decide the immediate next move based on current state and past plans (none provided here).\n\n### Verifying Other Possible Moves\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm other moves are indeed invalid:\n- Down to (1,0): y=0 is wall → invalid.\n- Left to (0,1): x=0 is wall → invalid.\n- Right to (2,1): opposite direction (current is Left) → invalid.\n\nThus, Up is the only valid move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all constraints and checks, the only safe and legal move is Up (\"U\").\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 35  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: (5, 2) is a wall inside the grid where the snake cannot go.  \n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head:\n- Head: (1, 2)\n- Body segments: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n  \nSo, the snake is quite long, with 10 segments.  \n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently facing \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).  \n**Food Items**:\n1.

Move Up (U) to (1, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper border, so (1,3) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not at (1,3).\n  - Body collision: The snake's body segments are at (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). (1,3) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Food at (1,3): There is no food listed at (1,3), so no eating.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no score change.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (0, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a border wall, so moving to (0,2) is a wall collision.\n  - Body: (0,2) is not in the body segments.\n- Outcome: Wall collision → death. Not a viable move.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (2, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right border, (2,2) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not at (2,2).\n  - Body collision: (2,2) is the 4th segment of the snake's body (counting from head as position 0: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), ...]). So, moving to (2,2) would collide with its own body.\n- However, the tail is at (4,2). The segment at (2,2) is not the tail, so this is a body collision.\n- Outcome: Body collision → death. Not a viable move.\n\n### Re-evaluating Moves\n\nFrom the above, moving Up seems to be the only safe option since moving Left or Right leads to death. But let's double-check the food situation to see if we're missing anything.\n\n**Food at (2,3)**: value = 9, life_span = 1  \n- Position (2,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body (it's the 4th segment: (2,3)).\n- According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away from that cell.\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n- Currently, the body is at (2,3), and the head is at (1,2). To eat the food at (2,3), we'd need the body to move away from (2,3), which would happen if the snake moves in a way that the tail moves forward, but given the snake's length and current positions, it's not immediately possible to free up (2,3) in one move.\n- Also, even if we could, moving the head to (2,3) would require moving right to (2,2) first, which we saw is a body collision.\n  \n**Food at (4,5)**: value = 4, life_span = 1  \n- Position (4,5) is not adjacent to the head (1,2), so we can't reach it in one move.\n  \n### Considering Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special case is the \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail position: (4,2)\n- Adjacent to head (1,2)? Let's see: (1,2) is adjacent to (0,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,3). (4,2) is not adjacent to (1,2), so this doesn't apply here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n- Move Up (U) to (1,3): Safe, no food, no score change.\n- Move Left (L) to (0,2): Wall collision → death.\n- Move Right (R) to (2,2): Body collision → death.\n\nThe only safe move is Up, even though it doesn't lead to eating any food immediately. The other moves are fatal, and we can't reach the high-value food at (2,3) safely in one move.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. The current positions are:\n     - Head: (1, 3)\n     - Body: (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"Up\" (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - (4, 5): value = 3, life_span = 1\n     - (2, 3): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand the positions, let's visualize the grid (only relevant parts):\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head at (1, 3)\n  - Body segments at: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n  \n- **Food**:\n  - (4,5): Positive food (value=3)\n  - (2,3): Positive food (value=8) — but this is currently under the snake's body at position (2,3) in the body segments.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Up (U), the snake cannot move Down (D) next.\n   - So, possible moves: U, L, R\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**:\n   - Moving Up from (1,3): (1,4) — check if this is a wall.\n     - y=7 is a wall, but y=4 is not a border wall, and there are no internal walls at (1,4).\n   - Moving Left from (1,3): (0,3) — x=0 is a border wall. So, cannot move Left.\n   - Moving Right from (1,3): (2,3) — check:\n     - (2,3) is part of the snake's body (6th segment). Moving here would collide with the body unless it's the tail, which it's not (tail is at (4,1)). So, this is a body collision — deadly.\n   \n   So, from the above, only moving Up is safe regarding walls and body collisions.\n\n3. **Food Considerations**:\n   - The food at (2,3) is under the snake's body. It can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away from (2,3), and then the head moves onto it. Currently, moving to (2,3) is deadly, so we cannot eat it now.\n   - The food at (4,5):\n     - Currently not under the snake.\n     - To reach it, we'd need to plan a path. From (1,3), moving Up to (1,4), then possibly Right to (2,4), etc., but this is for future planning.\n     - Since we're only deciding the immediate next move, and moving Up is safe, we can consider that.\n\n4. **Tail Reward Danger**:\n   - The tail is at (4,1), which is far from the head (distance of |4-1| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5). So, no immediate danger from the tail.\n   - The food at (2,3) is under the body, not the tail, so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Checking Immediate Actions\n\nGiven the above, the only safe immediate move is Up (U):\n\n- **Up (U)**: (1,3) → (1,4)\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not colliding with body (body segments are at y=1,2,3; moving to y=4 is safe).\n  - Not a reverse move (current is U, moving U is allowed).\n  \nOther moves:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (1,3) → (0,3) — wall (x=0). Invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (1,3) → (2,3) — body collision. Deadly.\n- **Down (D)**: Reverse of current direction. Invalid.\n\n### Food Life Span\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\n- (4,5): Not reachable in one move (distance is |4-1| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5). Cannot eat this turn.\n- (2,3): Under body, cannot eat this turn as moving there is deadly.\n\nSo, we cannot eat any food this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move is Up (U). \n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Up (U) to (1, 5)\n- **Check for walls**: y=5 is within bounds (since y=7 is the border), and x=1 is within bounds.\n- **Check for body collision**: The snake's body segments are at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). (1,5) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- **Check for food**: \n  - (1,5) is not listed as a food position, so no food here.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2.

Move Right (R) to (2, 4)\n- **Check for walls**: x=2 is within bounds, y=4 is within bounds.\n- **Check for body collision**: (2,4) is not in the snake's body list.\n- **Check for food**: \n  - (2,4) is not listed as a food position.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nSince moving Up or Right doesn't directly lead to food, but moving Right might be strategic for future moves towards the food at (5,4) or (4,5). \n\nHowever, the food at (2,3) is interesting because it's at the same position as one of the snake's body segments (2,3). \n\n**Special Case**: Food under the snake's body can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away.\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the snake's body includes (2,3). The food at (2,3) is under the body. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (2,3).\n- The head must move to (2,3).\n\nBut the head is at (1,4). To reach (2,3), the head would need to move Right to (2,4) and then Down to (2,3). However, moving Down from (2,4) would require the current direction to allow it, but since the current direction is Up, moving Down next would be a reverse, which is not allowed.\n\n**Alternative Approach**: \n- If the snake moves Right to (2,4), then in the next turn, it can move Left to (1,4) or Right to (3,4) or Down to (2,3).\n   - Moving Down to (2,3) would require the body to have moved away. The current body segment at (2,3) is the 7th segment (0-indexed). After moving Right to (2,4), the tail (3,1) moves forward, so the body segment at (2,3) would shift. \n\nBut, the tail is at (3,1), and the body is [(1,4), (1,3), ..., (3,1)]. After moving Right to (2,4), the new body becomes [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3), ..., (3,2)]. The segment at (2,3) is now the 6th segment. \n\nThis is complex, and it's unclear if (2,3) would be free in the next turn. Moreover, the food at (2,3) has a life_span of 7, but the countdown decreases every turn. Since the current turn is 37, and the food was generated at t=30 (37-7), it might disappear next turn.\n\n### Considering Other Food Items\n\n1. **(4,5)**:\n   - Value: 2, Life_span: 1 → Will disappear next turn (t=38).\n   - To reach (4,5) from (1,4), the snake needs to move Right thrice and Up once.\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n2. **(5,4)**:\n   - Value: 10, Life_span: 1 → Will disappear next turn (t=38).\n   - To reach (5,4) from (1,4), the snake needs to move Right four times.\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (3,1). The head is at (1,4). The tail is not adjacent to the head (Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |1-4| = 5 > 1), so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the immediate options:\n1. **Up (1,5)**: Safe, but no reward.\n2. **Right (2,4)**: Safe, no reward, but positions the snake closer to the high-value food at (5,4).\n3. **Left (0,4)**: Illegal.\n\nSince the high-value food at (5,4) has a life_span of 1, it's about to disappear. However, the snake cannot reach it in one move. \n\nThe food at (2,3) is under the body and might not be accessible in time. \n\nThus, the best immediate action is to move Right to (2,4), which is safe and positions the snake towards the center, allowing more flexibility in future moves.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **After moving Right**: \n  - New head position: (2,4).\n  - New body: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3), ..., (3,2)].\n  - Tail moves from (3,1) to (3,2).\n\nThis move is safe and doesn't lead to any immediate collisions or penalties.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, the best immediate action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The snake's head is at (2, 4) and is currently moving Right (R).

However, since the tail is at (3,2), moving to (2,3) would cause the head to collide with the body segment at (2,3) after the tail moves. This is unsafe because the tail will move from (3,2) to (3,3), and the head will be at (2,3), which is still occupied by the body. Thus, this is a collision.\n   - Food at (2,3): There is positive food at (2,3), but eating it would be dangerous because the head would collide with the newly grown tail (as the tail would not move away in time).\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (3, 4)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=3 is not a border wall.\n   - Check obstacles: No internal obstacle at (3, 4).\n   - Check body: (3,4) is not in the snake's body segments.\n   - Food at (3,4): No food at (3,4).\n\n4. **Left (L)**: Not allowed (instant reverse).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (4,5): Positive food, life span 1. Not adjacent to the head.\n- (2,3): Positive food, life span 6. Adjacent to the head, but eating it is dangerous (Tail Reward Danger).\n- (5,4): Positive food, life span 9. Not adjacent to the head.\n\n### Safe Moves:\n- Up (U) to (2,5): Safe, no food.\n- Right (R) to (3,4): Safe, no food.\n\n### Best Action:\nSince moving Up (U) or Right (R) are both safe but do not lead to immediate food, we can choose either. Moving Right (R) keeps the snake aligned with its current direction and avoids unnecessary turns. \n\nHowever, moving Up (U) may open up more options for future moves, as the snake is currently near the top of the grid (y=4, max y=7). Moving Right (R) would keep the snake in the middle of the grid, which might be safer in the long run.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally safe and neither leads to immediate food, we can choose **Right (R)** to maintain the current direction.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The next segment is at (2,4), meaning the snake was moving left to right (from (2,4) to (3,4)).\n\nThe tail is at (3,3), and just before that is (2,3), which is where one of the food items is located.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,4) moving right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (4,4)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,3)\n\nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,4)\n- Check if (4,4) is a wall: No, borders are at x=7.\n- Check if (4,4) is an internal obstacle: No, only (5,2) is.\n- Check if (4,4) is part of the snake's body: \n  Snake body segments: (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)\n  (4,4) is not in this list — safe.\n- Food at (4,4)? No food listed there.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,5)\n- Check if (3,5) is a wall: y=7 is border, so y=5 is safe.\n- Obstacle: No.\n- Body collision: \n  (3,5) is not in the body segments — safe.\n- Food at (3,5)? No food there.\n  \nSafe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,3)\n- Check if (3,3) is a wall: y=0 is border, y=3 is safe.\n- Obstacle: No.\n- Body collision: \n  (3,3) is the tail segment. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we have to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n  \n  - Tail is at (3,3), and the segment before that is (2,3).\n  - There is food at (2,3).\n  - If we move to (3,3), the tail was at (3,3) and will move to where the next segment was, which is (2,3).\n  - The head moves to (3,3), and the new tail will be at (2,3), which has food.\n  - After this move, the head is at (3,3), and the new tail is at (2,3) with food.\n  - Next turn, if we move to (2,3) to eat the food, the head would be at (2,3) and the tail would also be at (2,3) (since eating food makes the tail stay), causing a collision — this is the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n  \n  Therefore, moving Down to (3,3) is dangerous because it sets up a situation where eating the food at (2,3) next turn would kill the snake.\n\nThus, Down is unsafe.\n\n### Checking Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten safely.\n\n**Food at (2,3)**:\n- Currently, the snake's body is at (2,3) (part of the body, not the tail yet).\n- To eat this, the head needs to move onto (2,3) when it's not covered by the body.\n- Currently, the body is covering (2,3), so the head can't eat it now.\n- The tail is at (3,3), and before that is (2,3). So next turn, the tail will move from (3,3) to (2,3), and the segment at (2,3) will move away, possibly freeing (2,3) for the head to move onto next turn.\n- But as discussed, moving Down now would lead to a dangerous situation next turn, so we can't do that.\n\n**Food at (5,4)**:\n- Position is (5,4).\n- Current head is at (3,4). To reach (5,4), we'd need to move right twice: to (4,4), then to (5,4).\n- First move to (4,4) is safe, as we saw earlier.\n- Then next turn, from (4,4), possible moves would be to (5,4), (4,5), or (4,3).\n- Moving to (5,4) would eat the food there, which is positive, and no immediate danger is apparent from that move.\n  \nSo, moving towards (5,4) seems like a good plan.\n\n### Deciding the Immediate Action\n\nGiven the above, the best immediate action is to move towards the food at (5,4). \n\nFrom current head position (3,4), moving Right (R) to (4,4) is the first step towards that.\n\nAlternative moves:\n- Up to (3,5): safe but not towards any food.\n- Down to (3,3): dangerous due to Tail Reward Danger setup.\n  \nTherefore, **Right (R)** is the best immediate action.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there any other food or better path?\n- Only two foods: (2,3) is currently under the body and trying to eat it now is dangerous.\n- (5,4) is the other food, and moving right is the first step towards it.\n  \nNo other foods are present, so moving towards (5,4) is optimal.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), next turn we can:\n- Move Right to (5,4) to eat the food.\n- Or move Up/Down if there's a reason, but eating the food is beneficial.\n\nWe'd need to check next turn's state to ensure safety, but the immediate move is safe and progresses towards food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter carefully considering all possible moves and their implications, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However, since it's currently moving Right (R), it cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) next turn. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5, 4)\n- New head position: (5, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is not a wall (border walls are at x=7, and internal obstacle is at (5,2))\n  - Body: Check if (5,4) is in the snake's body. Current body positions:\n    - (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n    - (5,4) is not in the body, so no collision.\n- Food at (5,4): Yes, there's positive food here with value 1.\n  - Eating it: \n    - Reward: +1\n    - Length increases by 1: new segment added where the tail was (but tail moves forward unless we're eating the tail food)\n    - Check Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n      - Tail is at (2,3)\n      - Head is at (4,4), moving to (5,4)\n      - Distance from (5,4) to (2,3): |5-2| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 (not adjacent)\n      - So no danger here.\n  - So, eating (5,4) is safe and beneficial.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 5)\n- New head position: (4, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is wall, so (4,5) is safe.\n  - Body: Is (4,5) in the body? No.\n- Food at (4,5): No food listed here.\n- Outcome: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 3)\n- New head position: (4, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is wall, (4,3) is safe.\n  - Body: Is (4,3) in the body? No.\n- Food at (4,3): No food listed here.\n- Outcome: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nNow, let's compare the options:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n   - Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1)\n   - No immediate dangers\n   - Tail is at (2,3), not adjacent to new head (5,4), so no collision risk from growing tail.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,5)** or **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - Safe moves, but no immediate reward.\n   - Might be useful if we were avoiding something, but currently no threats.\n\nGiven that moving Right allows us to eat positive food safely, it seems like the best immediate action.\n\n### Checking for Potential Dangers\n\nIs there any danger in moving Right?\n\n- The food at (2,3) is under the snake's tail. \n  - To eat it, the tail would have to move away first, then the head moves onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is moving to (5,4), which doesn't affect the tail's position directly.\n  - So no immediate danger from that.\n\n- The other foods are at (6,6) and (2,3). \n  - (6,6) is far away, no interaction now.\n  - (2,3) is under tail, as mentioned.\n\nNo other apparent dangers.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nWhile we're supposed to decide the immediate action, it's good to think a bit ahead:\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,4):\n- New head: (5,4)\n- New body: adds a segment where the tail was (but tail moves forward unless we're eating tail food)\nWait, let's clarify how snake growth works:\n\nWhen the snake eats food, its length increases by 1. This means that the tail doesn't move in the next turn; a new segment is added where the tail was, making the snake longer.\n\nBut in our case, the tail is at (2,3), and we're eating at (5,4), which is not the tail. So the tail will move forward (the segment before the tail was (2,2)), and a new segment is added where the tail was (2,3), but since we're not eating at the tail, the tail moves, and the new segment is added at the position where the head was before moving (which is (4,4)).\n\nWait, no, let's think carefully:\n\nNormal movement without eating:\n- Head moves to new position, each body segment follows the one in front, tail segment is removed.\n\nWith eating:\n- Head moves to new position (with food), a new segment is added where the tail was (so tail doesn't move), increasing length by 1.\n\nBut in our case, we're eating at (5,4), which is not the tail's position (tail is at (2,3)). So the tail will move forward (from (2,3) to where the segment before it was, which is (2,2)), and a new segment is added at the position where the head was before moving (which is (4,4)).\n\nWait, no, maybe the new segment is added at the tail's old position regardless of where the food is eaten, unless it's the tail food.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, no mention of where the new segment is added unless it's tail food.\n\nBut the \"Tail Reward Danger\" implies that when eating tail food, the new tail would be where the head was, causing collision if adjacent.\n\nFor non-tail food, I think the new segment is added at the tail's old position, and the tail moves forward, increasing length by 1.\n\nSo after moving Right to (5,4) and eating:\n- New head: (5,4)\n- New body: (4,4) (old head), then the rest of the body, and a new segment at (2,3) (old tail), and the tail moves from (2,3) to (2,2), but since we're adding a segment at (2,3), the new tail is still (2,2) (from (2,3) to (2,2)), but the segment before was (2,2), so the tail was at (2,3), now moves to (2,2), and a new segment is added at (2,3), making the snake longer.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing, but the key is that eating non-tail food safely increases length without causing a collision.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states:\n\"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn our case:\n- Head is at (4,4), moving to (5,4)\n- Tail is at (2,3)\n- Distance: |5-2| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 (not adjacent; adjacent would be distance 1)\n- So no danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Right (R) to (5,4) allows the snake to eat positive food safely, increasing the score by 1 and the length by 1 without any immediate risks.\n\nOther moves don't provide immediate rewards and don't seem to offer strategic advantages in this context.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move Up (U) to (5,5):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=5 is within bounds (y=0 to y=7), x=5 is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (5,2) is not (5,5), so no obstacle.\n  - Body: Check if (5,5) is in snake's body positions.\n    - Snake body: [(4,4), (3,4), ..., (2,3)] - (5,5) is not in this list.\n- Safe move.\n- Food at (5,5)? No food there.\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n**2. Move Down (D) to (5,3):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=3 is within bounds, x=5 is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (5,2) is below (5,3), but not the same.\n  - Body: Is (5,3) in snake's body?\n    - Looking at body segments: (4,4), (3,4), ..., (2,3) - no (5,3).\n- Safe move.\n- Food at (5,3)? No food there.\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (6,4):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=6 is within bounds (x=0 to x=7), y=4 is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (5,2) is not (6,4).\n  - Body: Is (6,4) in snake's body? No.\n- Safe move.\n- Food at (6,4)? No, food is at (6,6) and (2,3).\n- Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, there's food at:\n1. (2,3):\n   - Currently under the tail segment (last position: (2,3)).\n   - To eat this, the tail must move away, and then the head must move onto (2,3).\n   - Currently, the head is at (5,4), tail at (2,3). Distance is significant; can't reach in one move.\n   - Also, if we try to approach it, by the time we get there, the food might disappear (life_span=4, current turn=41, so disappears at turn=45).\n   - Moreover, even if we could reach it, eating food under the tail is dangerous if the head is adjacent to the tail (Tail Reward Danger). Here, head is at (5,4), tail at (2,3), not adjacent (distance is more than 1), so not immediately dangerous, but still risky to plan for.\n   - Probably not worth pursuing right now.\n\n2. (6,6):\n   - Distance from head (5,4) to (6,6):\n     - x: 6-5=1, y:6-4=2.\n     - Manhattan distance: 1 + 2 = 3.\n   - Life_span=9, so disappears at turn=50.\n   - We have time to reach it, but need to plan path.\n   - Current move options don't directly get us closer to (6,6), but moving Right (R) to (6,4) is in the general direction (x increases).\n   - From (6,4), next move could be Up to (6,5), then (6,6).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that can be eaten in the next move?\n- Adjacent to (5,4):\n  - Up: (5,5) - no food.\n  - Down: (5,3) - no food.\n  - Left: (4,4) - no food (and can't move left, opposite of current direction).\n  - Right: (6,4) - no food.\nNo immediate food to eat.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nLooking at the snake's body and possible future moves:\n- Snake is quite long and coiled around the left side.\n- Moving Right seems safe and opens up space to maneuver towards the food at (6,6).\n- Moving Up or Down are also safe but don't directly help in reaching food.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the options:\n- Move Up (U): Safe, but not progressing towards food.\n- Move Down (D): Safe, but not progressing towards food.\n- Move Right (R): Safe, moves towards the general direction of food at (6,6), and opens up more space.\n\nBest immediate action is to move Right to (6,4), which is safe and aligns with a potential path to the food at (6,6).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, is there any danger with the food at (2,3):\n- Currently, head is at (5,4), tail at (2,3).\n- They are not adjacent (distance is more than 1), so no immediate danger if we somehow eat it later.\n- But as discussed, not reachable in one move, so not a concern now.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the current state and food positions, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's head is at (6, 4), followed by body segments at (5, 4), (4, 4), ..., ending at (2, 2).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - **Positive Food**: \n     - At (2, 3) with a value of +1 and a lifespan of 3 turns.\n     - At (6, 6) with a value of +1 and a lifespan of 8 turns.\n   - **Negative Food**: None mentioned, so all food is positive in this case.\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Right (R), so its next move can be Up (U), Down (D), or continue Right (R). It cannot reverse to Left (L) immediately.\n  \n### Possible Actions\n\nGiven the current direction is R, the possible next moves are U, D, or R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Right (R)**:\n   - New head position: (6+1, 4) = (7, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Wall**: x=7 is a border wall. Moving to (7,4) would collide with the wall → **Deadly**.\n   - **Conclusion**: Not a valid move.\n\n2. **Move Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (6, 4+1) = (6, 5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Body**: Check if (6,5) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Current body segments: (5,4), (4,4), ..., (2,2). (6,5) is not in this list → No body collision.\n     - **Wall**: y=5 is within bounds (0 to 7), and no internal wall at (6,5).\n   - Check for food:\n     - (6,6) is food, but it's not at (6,5). No immediate food consumption.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (6, 4-1) = (6, 3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Body**: (6,3) is not in the body segments → No collision.\n     - **Wall**: y=3 is within bounds, and no internal wall at (6,3).\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (6,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n### Comparing U and D\n\nBoth U and D are valid moves. Now, let's see which one is better in terms of strategy:\n\n1. **Food Proximity**:\n   - **Up (U)**: Moves towards (6,6), which is food. Next move could be U again to reach (6,6).\n   - **Down (D)**: Moves away from the food at (6,6) but closer to the food at (2,3). However, (2,3) is quite far and the snake would need to navigate a complex path.\n\n2. **Future Path Considerations**:\n   - Moving Up brings the head closer to the food at (6,6), which has a longer lifespan (8 turns). The other food at (2,3) has only 3 turns left, but it's more risky to reach due to the snake's long body.\n   - Moving Down might lead to a dead end or require more complex maneuvering to reach any food.\n\n3. **Tail Reward Danger**:\n   - The tail is at (2,2). The food at (2,3) is adjacent to the tail. If the snake were to eventually eat (2,3), it would need to ensure that the head doesn't collide with the newly grown tail. However, this is not an immediate concern since the snake is far from (2,3).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- Moving Up (U) is safer and brings the snake closer to the food at (6,6), which is a high-value target with a long lifespan.\n- Moving Down (D) doesn't offer immediate benefits and might complicate future movements.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe Tail Reward Danger rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. In this case:\n- The tail is at (2,2).\n- The food is at (2,3), which is adjacent to the tail.\n- However, the head is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to the tail. So, this rule doesn't affect the current decision.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 43  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions (head first)**:\n1. Head: (6, 5)\n2. Body segments: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2, 3): value = 2, life_span = 1\n2. (6, 6): value = 7, life_span = 1\n3. (3, 5): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,5) with direction U (Up), the possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (6,6) — y increases by 1\n- L (Left): (5,5)\n- R (Right): (7,5)\n\nWe cannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (U), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (6,6)\n- Check for walls: (6,6) is not a border wall (x=7 is border, y=7 is border, but (6,6) is within bounds).\n- Check for obstacles: (5,2) is the only internal obstacle, not (6,6).\n- Check for body collision: \n  - Snake body segments: (6,4), (5,4), ..., (2,1). (6,6) is not in this list.\n- Food at (6,6): \n  - There is food here: value = 7, life_span = 1.\n  - Eating it would give +7 to score and increase length by 1.\n  - Need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Current tail is at (2,1).\n    - Adjacent to tail means cells next to (2,1): (1,1), (3,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n    - (6,6) is not adjacent to (2,1), so no danger here.\n- Conclusion: Safe to move here and eat the food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5,5)\n- Check walls: (5,5) is within bounds.\n- Obstacles: (5,2) is not (5,5).\n- Body collision: (5,5) is not in snake body.\n- Food: No food at (5,5).\n- Conclusion: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7,5)\n- Check walls: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,5) is a wall.\n- Conclusion: Cannot move here, would collide with wall.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Move U: Eat food with value 7, safe.\n- Move L: No food, safe.\n- Move R: Wall, invalid.\n\nBetween U and L, U is clearly better because it allows eating high-value food (7) without any risk.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that eating the food at (6,6) doesn't cause a collision next turn:\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be the second-to-last segment before eating, which is (1,1).\n- New snake positions after moving U and eating:\n  - New head: (6,6)\n  - Body: (6,5), (6,4), ..., (1,1), (2,1) — but actually, the tail grows, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the head.\n  - So the tail is still (2,1), and the new segment is (6,6), with the rest following.\n- Next turn, if we move in some direction, the tail will move away from (2,1), so no immediate collision unless we move back into the tail, which is unlikely given the current snake's position.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nJust to ensure we're not missing a better opportunity:\n- Food at (2,3): value 2, life_span 1 — far from head, not reachable immediately.\n- Food at (3,5): value 10, life_span 1 — current head is at (6,5), so to reach (3,5), need to move left three times, which is not immediate.\n  \nThe food at (6,6) is the only one that can be eaten immediately with this move.\n\n### Life Span Consideration\n\nAll foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So the food at (6,6) will be gone next turn if we don't eat it now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (6,6) to eat the high-value food (7) safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,6) → (6,7)\n   - But y=7 is a border wall → **Invalid (collision)**\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,6) → (6,5)\n   - Opposite of current direction (U) → **Invalid (instant reverse)**\n3. **Left (L)**: (6,6) → (5,6)\n   - Check if (5,6) is occupied by body or wall:\n     - Body segments: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc. → (5,6) is not in the body.\n     - Walls: (5,2) is an internal wall, but (5,6) is not a wall.\n     - **Valid move**\n4. **Right (R)**: (6,6) → (7,6)\n   - x=7 is a border wall → **Invalid (collision)**\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Left (L)** to (5,6).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Left to (5,6) leads to any food:\n\n- (5,6) is not listed in the food positions → no food there.\n- The two food items are at (2,3) and (3,5), neither of which is adjacent to the head.\n\nHowever, the snake's tail is at (2,1), which is not near the head, so no \"Tail Reward Danger\" is present.\n\n### Evaluating the Food\n\nEven though we can't reach food immediately, let's look at the food items:\n\n1. **(2,3)**: \n   - Value: +1\n   - Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Distance from head: Manhattan distance = |6-2| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n   - Too far to reach in one move; would require a path planning over multiple turns.\n2. **(3,5)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life_span: 9\n   - Distance from head: |6-3| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Could be a target for future moves, but not reachable in one move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nAfter moving Left to (5,6), the snake's new head position would be (5,6), and the direction would be L. Possible next moves would be:\n\n- Up (U): (5,6) → (5,7) → y=7 is wall → invalid\n- Down (D): (5,6) → (5,5) → need to check if (5,5) is safe\n- Left (L): (5,6) → (4,6) → need to check if (4,6) is safe\n- Right (R): (5,6) → (6,6) → opposite of current direction (L) → invalid\n\nThis suggests that moving Left now could lead to a position where we can consider moving towards (3,5) in subsequent turns.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nMoving Left to (5,6):\n\n- Is (5,6) occupied by body?

So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's head is at (5, 6), followed by body segments in order: (6, 6), (6, 5), ..., (1, 1).\n     - So, the tail is at (1, 1).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving **Left (L)**. This means the last move was from (6,6) to (5,6) (leftward).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item is present at (3, 5) with:\n     - Value: +1 (positive food)\n     - Life span: 9 turns (countdown starts at 9 and decreases each turn, including the current one).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position relative to the food:\n\n- **Head**: (5, 6)\n- **Food**: (3, 5)\n\nThe food is at x=3, y=5. The head is at x=5, y=6.

However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: The snake is moving Left (L), so it cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Checks**:\n   - **Up (U)**: (5, 6) → (5, 7)\n     - y=7 is a border wall → **Invalid** (collision)\n   - **Down (D)**: (5, 6) → (5, 5)\n     - (5,5) is not a wall or obstacle. Check if it's part of the snake's body.\n     - Snake body segments: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., (1,1)\n     - (5,5) is not in the body → **Valid**\n   - **Left (L)**: (5, 6) → (4, 6)\n     - (4,6) is not a wall or obstacle. Check body:\n     - (4,6) is not in the body → **Valid**\n\nSo, possible valid moves: D, L\n\n### Evaluating Moves Towards Food\n\nThe food is at (3,5). Current head at (5,6).\n\n- **Move Down (D)**: (5,6) → (5,5)\n  - Distance to food from (5,5): \n    - x: |5-3| = 2\n    - y: |5-5| = 0\n    - Total: 2\n- **Move Left (L)**: (5,6) → (4,6)\n  - Distance to food from (4,6):\n    - x: |4-3| = 1\n    - y: |6-5| = 1\n    - Total: 2\n\nBoth moves result in the same Manhattan distance to the food (2). However, moving Left brings us closer in the x-direction, which might be more direct.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Access\n\nIs the food adjacent to the head after any move?\n\n- After D to (5,5), food is at (3,5):\n  - Not adjacent (need to move left twice).\n- After L to (4,6), food is at (3,5):\n  - Adjacent? (4,6) and (3,5) are diagonally adjacent (not directly adjacent in U/D/L/R sense).\n  \nNeither move immediately positions the head adjacent to the food.\n\n### Potential Path to Food\n\nFrom (5,6):\n\n1. **Option 1**: D → (5,5), then L → (4,5), then L → (3,5) (eat food)\n   - But after D to (5,5), next move could be L to (4,5), then L to (3,5).\n   - Need to ensure no collisions in these steps.\n\n2. **Option 2**: L → (4,6), then D → (4,5), then L → (3,5)\n   - Similar steps, just different order.\n\nBoth options require two moves to reach the food. \n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe food is positive (+1), so we need to ensure that after eating it, the new tail doesn't collide with the head.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,1). After eating, the tail will be at (1,1) (since the tail moves forward, but the snake grows by 1, so the last segment stays).\n\nBut the food is at (3,5), which is far from the tail, so no immediate danger from tail collision after eating.\n\n### Life Span Consideration\n\nFood life span is 9 at turn 45. It will disappear at turn 45 + 9 = 54. We have time to reach it.\n\n### Immediate Decision\n\nAt turn 45, we have two valid moves: D or L.\n\n- **Move Down (D)**:\n  - Pros: Moves towards the center, may open more options.\n  - Cons: Doesn't directly help in reaching the food immediately.\n  \n- **Move Left (L)**:\n  - Pros: Directly moves towards the food in x-direction.\n  - Cons: Moves towards the left edge, but still has space.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally valid in terms of distance to food, but moving Left seems more directly aligned with the food's x-coordinate, which is to the left of the head.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Left Move\n\nMove Left to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) safe?\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not in current body: [(6,6), (6,5), ..., (1,1)] → (4,6) not present.\n  \nSafe to move Left.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that moving Left is safe and moves the head closer to the food's x-coordinate without increasing the distance in y, and considering that we cannot move Right (reverse), Left seems the better immediate move to eventually reach the food at (3,5).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

There's also one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - **Head**: (4, 6)\n   - **Body Segments**: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)]\n   - **Current Direction**: Left (L)\n\n   The snake is moving left, so its head is at (4,6), and the next segment is at (5,6), meaning the snake was previously moving right before turning left.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - **Food at (3, 5)**: Value = 1, Life Span = 8\n   - **Food at (5, 5)**: Value = 1, Life Span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,6) moving left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4, 7)\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 5)\n- **Left (L)**: (3, 6)\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 6)\n\nHowever, we cannot reverse the direction immediately, so moving right (R) is not allowed (since current direction is left, right is the opposite).\n\nSo, valid moves are U, D, L.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,7)**:\n   - Check borders: y=7 is a border wall. **Collision with wall**. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check borders: y=5 is within bounds.\n   - Check body segments: Is (4,5) in the snake's body?\n     - Current body segments: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n     - (4,5) is not in the body. **Safe**.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Food at (3,5) and (5,5). (4,5) has no food. No immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Left (L) to (3,6)**:\n   - Check borders: x=3 is within bounds.\n   - Check body segments: Is (3,6) in the snake's body?\n     - (3,6) is not in the body. **Safe**.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (3,6). No immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see if moving in a certain direction can set us up to eat food in subsequent moves.\n\n- **Food at (3,5)**:\n  - Currently at (4,6). To reach (3,5):\n    - Path: Down to (4,5), then Left to (3,5).\n    - Or Left to (3,6), then Down to (3,5).\n  - Both paths require two moves. No immediate eating.\n\n- **Food at (5,5)**:\n  - From (4,6), to reach (5,5):\n    - Down to (4,5), then Right to (5,5).\n    - Or Right is not allowed (reverse direction), so only first path.\n  - Also two moves away.\n\nHowever, moving down to (4,5) seems more versatile as it opens paths to both foods:\n- From (4,5):\n  - Left to (3,5) to eat the first food.\n  - Right to (5,5) to eat the second food.\n  \nMoving left to (3,6) only allows moving down to (3,5) next, which is towards one food but away from the other.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail position: (1,2)\nAdjacent cells to tail: (0,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,3)\nHead is at (4,6), not adjacent to tail. So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Down to (4,5)\n\nFrom (4,5):\n- Next moves could be Left to (3,5) to eat food or Right to (5,5) to eat the other food.\n- Both foods are positive (+1), so no penalty.\n- Life spans are 8 and 10, so they'll be around for a while.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Left to (3,6)\n\nFrom (3,6):\n- Next moves could be Down to (3,5) to eat food or Left to (2,6) (but then we're moving away from the other food).\n- Less flexibility compared to moving down.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's quite long and occupies a significant portion of the grid. Moving left might eventually lead to being boxed in, whereas moving down seems to open more space.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that could be eaten if the body moves away?\n- Current head is at (4,6). No food is listed at (4,6).\n- Other body segments: no food is listed under them except possibly the tail, but the tail is at (1,2), which has no food listed.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (Down and Left), moving Down to (4,5) seems better because:\n- It keeps both food options open for the next move.\n- It doesn't immediately lead towards a potentially confined space.\n- There's no immediate reward for either move, but Down offers more flexibility.\n\n### Verifying No Better Immediate Options\n\nIs there a way to eat food immediately?\n- From (4,6), no adjacent cells have food (food is at (3,5) and (5,5), which are diagonally adjacent but not directly adjacent in movement).\n- So no immediate eating possible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 47.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Game Board Dimensions:**\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move to these coordinates.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n   - **Positions (head first):** [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3)]\n     - Head is at (4,5).\n     - Tail is at (1,3).\n   - **Current Direction:** D (Down). This means the last move was Down, so the snake moved from (4,6) to (4,5).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - (3,5): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (5,5): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U):** (4,5) → (4,6)\n- **Down (D):** (4,5) → (4,4)\n- **Left (L):** (4,5) → (3,5)\n- **Right (R):** (4,5) → (5,5)\n\nBut we have to consider:\n- **No instant reverse:** Since the current direction is D, the opposite is U. So, we cannot move Up next (that would be instant reverse from Down to Up). So, U is invalid.\n  \nSo, valid moves: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Valid Move\n\n**1. Move Down (D): (4,5) → (4,4)**\n   - Check if (4,4) is safe:\n     - Is it a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7. (4,4) is within bounds.\n     - Is it part of the snake's body?\n       - Snake body segments: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3)\n       - (4,4) is in the body (7th segment from head). So, moving here would collide with the body. **Dangerous.**\n   - **Conclusion:** Cannot move Down.\n\n**2. Move Left (L): (4,5) → (3,5)**\n   - Check (3,5):\n     - Wall? No.\n     - Body collision?\n       - Snake body doesn't include (3,5). It's safe.\n     - Food at (3,5)? Yes, value = 1 (positive).\n       - Check Tail Reward Danger:\n         - Adjacent to tail: Tail is at (1,3). Adjacent cells to tail are (0,3), (2,3), (1,2), (1,4).\n         - (3,5) is not adjacent to (1,3). So, no danger.\n       - Eating this food is safe and beneficial.\n   - **Conclusion:** Safe move, can eat positive food.\n\n**3. Move Right (R): (4,5) → (5,5)**\n   - Check (5,5):\n     - Wall? No.\n     - Body collision? Snake body doesn't include (5,5). Safe.\n     - Food at (5,5)? Yes, value = 1 (positive).\n       - Tail Reward Danger:\n         - Tail is at (1,3). Adjacent cells: (0,3), (2,3), (1,2), (1,4).\n         - (5,5) is not adjacent to tail. Safe.\n       - Eating is safe.\n   - **Conclusion:** Safe move, can eat positive food.\n\n### Comparing L and R\n\nBoth L and R are safe and lead to positive food. Now, let's see which is better:\n\n- **Food at (3,5):** life_span = 7\n- **Food at (5,5):** life_span = 9\n\nBoth have the same value, but (3,5) has a shorter life span (7 vs 9). However, since both are positive and safe, and we're at turn 47, both have enough life left (assuming life_span counts down from spawn until now, but we don't know spawn turn). \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the snake's body after moving:\n\nAfter moving Left to (3,5):\n- New head: (3,5)\n- Tail was at (1,3), moves to (1,4) (since the second last segment is (1,4), tail follows).\n- New body: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), ..., (1,4)]\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- Tail moves to (1,4)\n- New body: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6), ..., (1,4)]\n\nLooking ahead, after Left:\n- Next moves from (3,5): possible directions (since last move was L), can't go R (instant reverse).\n- Possible: U, D, L\n   - U: (3,6) - but y=6 is safe, but check body: (4,6) is body, so no.\n   - D: (3,4) - body has (3,4), so no.\n   - L: (2,5) - not in body, safe.\n   So only L is possible next, which might be limiting.\n\nAfter Right:\n- Next moves from (5,5): last move R, can't go L.\n- Possible: U, D, R\n   - U: (5,6) - body has (5,6), no.\n   - D: (5,4) - body has (5,4), no.\n   - R: (6,5) - body has (6,5), no.\n   So no safe moves next, which is bad.\n\nWait, this seems like both lead to dead ends next move. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, after moving Left to (3,5):\nNext moves:\n- From (3,5), last move L, can't go R.\n- U: (3,6) - body has (4,6), not (3,6), so safe?\n   - (3,6) is not in body: body is [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), ...], so (3,6) is safe.\n- D: (3,4) - body has (3,4), no.\n- L: (2,5) - not in body, safe.\nSo U and L are possible next moves.\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,5):\nNext moves:\n- From (5,5), last move R, can't go L.\n- U: (5,6) - body has (5,6), no.\n- D: (5,4) - body has (5,4), no.\n- R: (6,5) - body has (6,5), no.\nSo no safe moves next, which is a problem.\n\nTherefore, moving Right leads to a dead end next turn, while moving Left allows at least U or L next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween Left and Right:\n- Left allows future moves, Right doesn't.\n- Both allow eating positive food now.\n  \n**Best Action:** Move Left to (3,5) to eat the positive food and keep future options open.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2). This is a single cell that the snake cannot pass through.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. \n     - Head: (3, 5)\n     - Next segments: (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3)\n   - **Length**: Counting these, the snake is 13 segments long.\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving Left (L), meaning the last move was from (4,5) to (3,5).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item is present at (5, 5) with a value of +1 and a life span of 8 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand the positions, let's visualize the grid (rows y=7 to y=0, columns x=0 to x=7):\n\n```\ny\\x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n7 |               |\n6 |       * * *   |\n5 |     H *   * * |\n4 | * * * * * *   |\n3 | *             |\n2 |     *         |\n1 |               |\n0 |               |\n```\n\n- `H` is the head at (3,5).\n- `*` represents the snake's body segments.\n- The food is at (5,5), which is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at (6,5) is on top of it).\n- Internal wall at (5,2) is not directly relevant to the current position.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: The current direction is Left (L), so the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next move.\n   - Possible moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**:\n   - Current head: (3,5)\n   - Up (U): (3,6) \n     - Check walls: y=7 is a border, but y=6 is not a border wall. Also, (3,6) is part of the snake's body (segment at (4,6) is next to it, but actually (3,6) is not in the snake's body list. Wait, let's check:\n       - Snake body positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), ...]. So (3,6) is not in the body. \n       - Also, no internal wall at (3,6).\n     - Valid move.\n   - Down (D): (3,4)\n     - (3,4) is in the snake's body (9th segment). Moving here would collide with the body.\n     - Invalid move.\n   - Left (L): (2,5)\n     - Check walls: x=0 is a border, but x=2 is not.\n     - Check body: (2,5) is not in the body list.\n     - Valid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: U, L\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two possible moves:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (3,6)**:\n   - New head position: (3,6)\n   - Body will shift: new body is [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), ..., (1,3)], tail (1,3) is removed.\n   - Food at (5,5) is under (6,5). Moving up doesn't directly interact with the food.\n   - No immediate reward or penalty.\n   - Future considerations: Moving up may open paths to other areas, but currently no other food is present.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (2,5)**:\n   - New head position: (2,5)\n   - Body shifts: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), ..., (1,3)], tail (1,3) removed.\n   - Food at (5,5) is under (6,5). Moving left doesn't directly interact with the food.\n   - No immediate reward or penalty.\n   - Future considerations: Moving left continues in the current direction, possibly exploring the left side of the grid.\n\n### Considering the Food at (5,5)\n\nThe food at (5,5) is under the snake's body at (6,5). To eat this food:\n- The body must move away from (6,5), and then the head must move onto (5,5).\n- Currently, the head is at (3,5), moving left to (2,5) doesn't help in reaching (5,5) soon.\n- Moving up to (3,6) also doesn't directly help in reaching (5,5).\n\nGiven that the food has a life span of 8 turns, and we're at turn 48, it will disappear at turn 56. We might want to plan to eat it before then, but for the immediate move, neither U nor L directly helps in eating it.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- Eating it would cause the head and newly grown tail to collide.\n\nCurrently:\n- Tail is at (1,3).\n- Head is at (3,5), adjacent cells to head are:\n  - (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), (3,4)\n  - (1,3) is not adjacent to (3,5) (distance is sqrt((3-1)^2 + (5-3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) ~ 2.8, not 1).\n  - So, tail is not adjacent to head now. No immediate danger.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions\n\nFor both possible moves:\n- Up to (3,6): Not in body, not a wall.\n- Left to (2,5): Not in body, not a wall.\n\nBoth are safe.\n\n### Deciding Between U and L\n\nBoth moves are safe and don't lead to immediate rewards or dangers. We can consider:\n\n1. **Space Exploration**:\n   - Moving Up (U) to (3,6) might open up more space towards the top.\n   - Moving Left (L) to (2,5) continues leftward, possibly towards the left edge where x=0 is a wall.\n\n2. **Future Access to Food**:\n   - To reach (5,5), moving up might be better as it could allow the snake to loop around.\n   - Moving left continues away from the food.\n\nGiven that the food is at (5,5) and we're at (3,5), moving left takes us further away (to (2,5)), while moving up takes us to (3,6), which is closer in terms of potential future paths to (5,5).\n\n### Potential Path to Food\n\nFrom (3,6), possible future moves could be:\n- Right to (4,6), then down to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), etc., potentially allowing the body to move away from (6,5) so the head can reach (5,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), it's harder to loop back to (5,5) quickly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween U and L, moving Up seems slightly better as it may provide a better path to eventually reach the food at (5,5) before it disappears, while also exploring more of the grid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game to better understand the positions and possible moves.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is an 8x8 grid (from (0,0) to (7,7)) because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- Internal obstacle: (5,2) — so the snake cannot move to (5,2).\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nThe snake's body is given as a list from head to tail:\n- Head: (2,6)\n- Body: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\nSo, the snake is quite long (length 13).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). This means the previous move was to the left (from (3,6) to (2,6)).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,5): value = +1, life_span = 6\n2. (6,2): value = +1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) next.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new head positions for each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x,y+1) = (2,6+1) = (2,7)\n   - Check walls: y=7 is a wall → collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (x,y-1) = (2,6-1) = (2,5)\n   - Check walls: Not a wall.\n   - Check body: Is (2,5) in the snake's body?\n     - Current body positions: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n     - (2,5) is not in the body.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (x-1,y) = (2-1,6) = (1,6)\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=1 is not.\n   - Check body: Is (1,6) in the snake's body?\n     - Not in the list.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: D, L.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two valid moves to decide which is better.\n\n**Move Down (D) to (2,5)**:\n- Is there food at (2,5)? \n  - Food positions: (5,5), (6,2) → no.\n- After moving, the tail will move forward, so the tail at (2,4) will move to where? \n  - The tail is the last segment, so the new tail will be (3,4) (since the snake moves forward by one cell).\n- No immediate reward or penalty.\n- Future considerations: Moving down may open up more options in the future.\n\n**Move Left (L) to (1,6)**:\n- Is there food at (1,6)? No.\n- After moving, the tail moves to (3,4).\n- No immediate reward or penalty.\n- Future considerations: Moving left takes the snake closer to the left wall (x=0), which may limit future moves.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if moving in a certain direction could lead to food in the next steps.\n\n**Food at (5,5)**:\n- Current head at (2,6).\n- Distance: |5-2| + |5-6| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away.\n- Life_span = 6, current turn = 50, so it will disappear at turn 56.\n- To reach (5,5), the snake needs to move right and down, but currently moving left, and can't reverse instantly.\n\n**Food at (6,2)**:\n- Distance: |6-2| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8 steps away.\n- Life_span = 9, disappears at turn 59.\n- To reach (6,2), the snake needs to move right and down, but currently moving left.\n\nGiven the snake's length and current position, reaching either food seems challenging without risking collision.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to ensure that if we move to a cell adjacent to the tail, and that tail cell has positive food, we don't eat it in a way that causes the head and new tail to collide.\n\nIn the current state:\n- Tail is at (2,4).\n- Adjacent to tail: (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), (2,5).\n- Our possible moves are to (2,5) or (1,6).\n   - (2,5): is it adjacent to tail? (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) (tail) via (2,5) and (2,4) share y-coordinate difference of 1.\n   - Is there food at (2,4)? No, food is at (5,5) and (6,2).\n   - So, no danger from tail reward here.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nThe head is at (2,6). Is there food under the head?\n- Food positions: (5,5), (6,2) → no.\nSo, no food to eat immediately.\n\n### Decision Between D and L\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body. \n\n- **Move Down (D)**:\n  - New head at (2,5).\n  - Future options from (2,5): can move U (back to (2,6), but that's the body), D (to (2,4), which is the tail and will move), L (to (1,5)), R (to (3,5), which is in the body.\n  - So, from (2,5), possible moves would be D or L.\n\n- **Move Left (L)**:\n  - New head at (1,6).\n  - Future options from (1,6): can move U (to (1,7) - wall), D (to (1,5)), L (to (0,6) - wall), R (to (2,6) - body).\n  - So, from (1,6), only possible move is D.\n\nMoving Left seems more restrictive for future moves, as it leaves only one possible move next turn (D). Moving Down keeps more options open (D or L next turn).\n\n### Potential Path to Food\n\nWhile both foods are currently out of reach without risky moves, moving Down might slightly better position the snake to eventually reach (5,5):\n\nFrom (2,5):\n- Next move D to (2,4) (tail moves, so body is now from (2,5) to (3,4)).\n- Then could move R to (3,4) — but (3,4) is the new tail, which is safe because the tail will move away.\n- Then could move R to (4,4), etc., working towards (5,5).\n\nThis is speculative, but Down seems to offer a better path towards the food in the long run compared to Left.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating both possible moves:\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, keeps more options open for future moves.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe but restricts future moves more.\n\nGiven that, the better immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 51  \n**Grid Size**: Assuming it's an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — can't move here.\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (2, 5), followed by body segments:  \n[(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]  \nTotal length: 13 segments.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D).  \nThis means the last move was Down (from (2,6) to (2,5)).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5, 5): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 5\n2. (6, 2): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,5) and moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1,5)\n- **Right (R)**: (3,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,4) — but can't reverse to Up (U) since that would be opposite of current direction.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, (1,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (1,5) is in snake positions. Current body positions don't include (1,5) — closest is (2,5), (2,6), etc.\n  - Safe to move here.\n- Food: No food at (1,5).\n- Outcome: Just move, no score change.\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R) to (3,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is far, (3,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (3,5) is part of the snake's body (4th segment in the list).\n    - Normally, moving into body is deadly, but if it's the tail, it's okay because the tail moves forward.\n    - The tail is the last segment: (3,4). Next is (5,4), etc. So (3,5) is not the tail; it's the 4th segment.\n    - Therefore, moving into (3,5) would collide with the body — deadly.\n- Outcome: Deadly collision. Can't move Right.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (2,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (2,4) is in snake positions. Current body positions don't include (2,4).\n  - Safe to move here.\n- Food: No food at (2,4).\n- Outcome: Just move, no score change.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can aim for any food in the next moves.\n\n**Food at (5,5)**:\n- Current head at (2,5). To reach (5,5), need to move right three times.\n- But moving Right now leads to collision, so can't go directly right.\n- Alternative path: Down to (2,4), then right, etc. But seems lengthy and not immediate.\n\n**Food at (6,2)**:\n- From (2,5), need to move down and right.\n- Also not immediately accessible in one move.\n\nGiven that, neither food is directly reachable in the next move. So the priority is to stay safe.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" is when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food. Eating it would make the head and new tail collide.\n- Current tail is at (3,4).\n- Adjacent to tail: positions are (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5).\n- Head is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to tail (3,4) — adjacent would be (2,4), (3,5), etc. (2,5) is not adjacent to (3,4).\n- So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Checking Immediate Moves\n\nFrom above:\n- Left (L) to (1,5): safe, no food.\n- Right (R) to (3,5): deadly collision.\n- Down (D) to (2,4): safe, no food.\n\nBetween Left and Down, both are safe with no immediate benefit. Let's see which one opens up better options next.\n\n**If Left to (1,5)**:\n- Next moves from (1,5): Left (0,5) — wall (dead), Down (1,4), Up (1,6).\n- Up is opposite of current Down, so can't reverse to Up immediately.\n- So next could be Left (dead) or Down (1,4).\n\n**If Down to (2,4)**:\n- Next moves from (2,4): Left (1,4), Right (3,4), Down (2,3).\n- Current direction is Down, so can't go Up (but Up wasn't an option anyway).\n- More options here: Left, Right, Down.\n\nDown seems to offer more flexibility next turn compared to Left which might corner us.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Down, Down seems slightly better for future moves. Also, moving Down keeps us away from the body that's to our right.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nJust to confirm, is there any food under the snake's body that we can eat by moving away?\n- Current head is at (2,5). Food is at (5,5) and (6,2).\n- No food is under the head or adjacent body parts that we can expose by moving away.\n  \n### Final Choice\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest and most flexible move is Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to take at Turn 52.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Game Board Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- **Positions (head first):** [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n  - Head: (2,4)\n  - Tail: (4,4)\n- **Current Direction:** D (Down)\n  - This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn (from (2,5) to (2,4)).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - (5,5): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (6,2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- The snake can move Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n- **No instant reverse:** Since the current direction is D, the snake cannot move U next (that would be instant reverse).\n  \nSo, possible moves from current direction D: D, L, R.\n\n**Current Head Position:** (2,4)\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n1. **Down (D):** (2,4) → (2,3)\n   - Check for walls: y=3 is not a wall (y=0 is the border).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - The snake's body segments are all positions except the head.\n     - (2,3) is not in the body list [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)].\n     - Wait, the tail is at (4,4), which will move forward when the head moves, so the new tail position will be after the head moves.\n     - Actually, the body is everything except the head, so (2,3) is safe unless it's in the body excluding the tail which will move.\n     - Currently, (2,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (2,3).\n\n2. **Left (L):** (2,4) → (1,4)\n   - Check walls: x=1 is not a wall (x=0 is border).\n   - Body collision:\n     - (1,4) is not in the body.\n   - Food:\n     - No food at (1,4).\n\n3. **Right (R):** (2,4) → (3,4)\n   - Check walls: x=3 is not a wall.\n   - Body collision:\n     - (3,4) is not in the body.\n   - Food:\n     - No food at (3,4).\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions:\n\n1. (5,5): value=1, life_span=4\n   - Distance from head (2,4):\n     - Δx = 3, Δy = 1 → total distance = 4 (Manhattan distance).\n   - To reach it, the snake would need to move right and then up/down, but it's not immediately adjacent.\n\n2. (6,2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - Distance: Δx = 4, Δy = 2 → total distance = 6.\n   - Even farther.\n\n3. (6,5): value=1, life_span=10\n   - Distance: Δx = 4, Δy = 1 → total distance = 5.\n   - Also not immediately adjacent.\n\nNone of the foods are adjacent to the current head position (2,4). So, in the immediate next move, we cannot eat any food. Therefore, the priority is to move safely towards a food source without colliding.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n  \nCurrent tail position: (4,4)\nIs the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head: (2,4), Tail: (4,4)\n- Distance: Δx = 2, Δy = 0 → not adjacent (adjacent means Δx + Δy = 1).\nSo, no danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that:\n- Doesn't lead to a dead end.\n- Moves towards the nearest food (5,5).\n\nFrom (2,4), the path to (5,5):\n- Need to increase x and y.\nCurrent possible moves (D, L, R):\n- D: (2,3) - away from food in y.\n- L: (1,4) - away from food in x.\n- R: (3,4) - towards food in x.\n\nMoving Right (R) seems best as it moves the head closer to the food in the x-direction.\n\n**Check safety of R: (3,4)**\n- Not a wall.\n- Not in body (current body positions don't include (3,4)).\n- Tail is at (4,4), which will move to (3,5) after the head moves (since the snake moves forward, the tail follows the body).\n\nWait, let's see the body after moving R:\nNew head: (3,4)\nBody becomes: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\nTail was (4,4), which is now the second last segment, so new tail is (5,4).\n\nIs (3,4) in the new body? No, because the body is [(2,4), (2,5), ...], and (3,4) is the head.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Moving Down (D)\n\nIf we move D to (2,3):\n- Next possible moves from D (no reverse to U): D, L, R.\n- From (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is possible, but we're moving away from food in y.\n- Not ideal for reaching (5,5).\n\n### Moving Left (L)\n\nMove L to (1,4):\n- Takes us away from food in x.\n- Not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Right (R) to (3,4) is the best option:\n- Moves towards food at (5,5).\n- Safe from collisions.\n- Doesn't reverse direction.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(5, 5): value=3, life_span=1\n2. (6, 2): value=6, life_span=1\n3. (6, 5): value=9, life_span=1\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 4), moving Right (R) would go to (4, 4). But let's check all possible moves (U, D, L, R) considering:\n- No instant reverse: Last move was R, so cannot move L (left) next.\n- Avoid walls and body collisions.\n\n**Current head direction**: R  \n**Cannot move**: L (opposite of R)\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3, 4) → (3, 5)\n   - Check (3,5): It's part of the snake's body (positions: ..., (3,5), ...)\n   - Moving here would collide with body → deadly → cannot do this.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (3, 4) → (3, 3)\n   - Check (3,3): \n     - Not in walls: borders are at y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is fine.\n     - Not in snake's body: looking at positions, none at (3,3).\n     - No internal obstacle at (3,3).\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (3, 4) → (4, 4)\n   - Check (4,4):\n     - Not in walls.\n     - Not in snake's body (positions: ..., (5,4), ... so (4,4) is free).\n     - No internal obstacle.\n   - Safe move.\n\nSo possible safe moves: D, R\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can eat any food this turn. To eat food:\n- Head must move onto the food cell.\n- Food must not be under the snake's body unless the body moves away first (but since we're moving the head first, this is unlikely unless the food is under the tail, which moves after the head).\n\nLooking at food positions:\n1. (5,5): value=3\n   - To reach (5,5) from (3,4) in one move: not possible (need at least two moves).\n2. (6,2): value=6\n   - From (3,4) to (6,2): not possible in one move.\n3. (6,5): value=9\n   - From (3,4) to (6,5): not possible in one move.\n\nNone of the foods are adjacent to the head, so we cannot eat any food this turn regardless of our move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is on the tail and if moving towards it would cause a collision after growth.\n\nTail is at (5,4). Is there food at (5,4)? No, foods are at (5,5), (6,2), (6,5).\n\nNo danger from tail reward this turn.\n\n### Choosing Between D and R\n\nSince we can't eat food this turn, we should choose a move that:\n- Keeps us safe (both D and R do).\n- Positions us better for future food collection.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving R to (4,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (4,4): U to (4,5) — but (4,5) is body.\n  - D to (4,3) — free.\n  - R to (5,4) — but (5,4) is tail, which will move, so safe unless food is there (none).\n- Moving D to (3,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,3): U to (3,4) — but that's where we came from (reverse of D, which is allowed after next move).\n  - D to (3,2) — free.\n  - L to (2,3) — possible, but need to check if allowed based on next direction.\n  - R to (4,3) — free.\n\nBoth moves seem safe. Maybe R is slightly better because it moves us towards the center where more food might appear, but D is also fine.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving R to (4,4) might be better because moving D to (3,3) could potentially box us in more in the future due to the long body.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nAfter R to (4,4):\n- Next turn, head at (4,4), direction R.\n- Possible moves: U to (4,5) — body, no.\n- D to (4,3) — free.\n- R to (5,4) — tail is at (5,4), but tail will move to (6,4), so safe unless food is at (5,4) (none).\n\nAfter D to (3,3):\n- Next turn, head at (3,3), direction D.\n- Possible moves: U to (3,4) — reverse of D, not allowed (can't go U after D).\n- D to (3,2) — free.\n- L to (2,3) — free.\n- R to (4,3) — free.\n\nBoth seem okay, but R might give slightly more options next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween D and R, both are safe, but R seems slightly better for future movement options.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 54. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5,2) — can't move here.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): \n     - Head: (4,4)\n     - Body: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n   - Current direction: Right (R) — last move was to the right.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (5,5): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (6,2): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,4) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n- **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n\nBut we can't reverse direction instantly. Since the current direction is R, the opposite is L, so we can't move Left next. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collision) and potential to eat food.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check if (4,5) is occupied by snake body: \n     - Looking at snake positions: (4,5) is in the body (8th position from head). \n     - So moving here would collide with body — deadly. \n   - **Not safe**.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check walls: y=3 is not a wall.\n   - Check obstacles: (5,2) is an obstacle, but we're at (4,3) — no issue.\n   - Check snake body: Is (4,3) in body positions? \n     - Scanning the list: No, it's not.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food nearby? \n     - Next to (4,3): No food at (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), etc. in current food list.\n   - Just a safe move, no immediate food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check walls: x=5 is not a border wall.\n   - Check obstacles: (5,2) is an obstacle, but we're at (5,4) — no issue.\n   - Check snake body: Is (5,4) in body positions?\n     - Last position is (6,4), so (5,4) is not in body.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food nearby?\n     - Current position after move: (5,4)\n     - Adjacent cells: \n       - (5,5): has food (value=1, life_span=2)\n       - Others: (6,4) is snake's tail, (4,4) is previous head, (5,3) is empty.\n     - Next move could be to (5,5) to eat food, but need to check if that's safe.\n     - However, eating (5,5):\n       - Current tail is at (6,4). After eating, tail grows by 1, so new tail would be at (6,4) (since the tail doesn't move when eating).\n       - Then, head would be at (5,5), and new tail is (6,4). \n       - Is head adjacent to new tail? (5,5) and (6,4) are diagonally adjacent — not directly adjacent (not same x or y with difference 1).\n       - So no immediate collision.\n   - But we're deciding current move, not next. Moving to (5,4) is safe, sets up potential to eat (5,5) next if we choose.\n\n### Comparing Down (D) and Right (R)\n\n- **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n  - Safe.\n  - No immediate food access.\n  - Next moves could explore lower part of the grid.\n\n- **Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n  - Safe.\n  - Positions us to potentially eat (5,5) next turn.\n  - (5,5) has life_span=2, so it will disappear after 2 more turns (including current turn if we don't eat it now). \n    - At turn 54, countdown is 2, so at turn 55 it's 1, turn 56 it's gone.\n    - If we move to (5,4) at turn 54, at turn 55 we can move to (5,5) to eat it before it disappears.\n\nOther food:\n- (6,2): life_span=5 — can reach later.\n- (6,5): life_span=8 — can reach later.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFor food at (6,5):\n- Currently, tail is at (6,4).\n- If head moves to (6,5) to eat:\n  - After eating, tail grows by 1, so new tail is at (6,4).\n  - Head at (6,5), tail at (6,4): adjacent (same x, y differs by 1) — this is the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n  - So eating (6,5) would kill the snake. Hence, we should avoid eating (6,5) when tail is at (6,4).\n\nBut currently, we're not in a position to eat (6,5), so it's not an immediate concern.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween D and R:\n- R sets up to eat (5,5) next turn, which is safe and beneficial.\n- D is safe but doesn't lead to immediate food.\n\nBest immediate action is to move Right to (5,4), setting up to eat (5,5) next turn.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there food under the head currently? Head is at (4,4). Checking food positions:\n- (5,5), (6,2), (6,5) — none at (4,4). So no need to consider eating now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 55  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead is at (5,4), followed by body segments in this order:  \n[(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]  \nSo, the tail is at (6,5).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5,5): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (6,2): value=4, life_span=1\n3. (6,5): value=7, life_span=1\n4. (1,3): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,3)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,4) - but this is opposite to current direction (R), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Right (R)**: (6,4)\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n**1. Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n- (5,5) is a food position with value=1.\n- Check if eating it is safe:\n  - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be where the current tail is (6,5).\n  - The new head is at (5,5), and the new tail is at (6,5).\n  - Is (6,5) adjacent to (5,5)? Yes: (5,5) and (6,5) are adjacent (right next to each other).\n  - This is \"Tail Reward Danger\": eating food adjacent to the tail causes the head and new tail to collide in the next move.\n  - **Conclusion**: Eating (5,5) is deadly. Avoid this move.\n\n**2. Down (D) to (5,3)**:\n- Check if (5,3) is safe:\n  - Is (5,3) a wall? No.\n  - Is (5,3) occupied by the snake's body?\n    - Snake body segments: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5).\n    - (5,3) is not in this list.\n  - Is (5,3) an internal obstacle? No, the only internal obstacle is at (5,2).\n  - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Down to (5,3).\n\n**3. Right (R) to (6,4)**:\n- Check if (6,4) is safe:\n  - Is (6,4) a wall? x=7 is a wall, but x=6 is not.\n  - Is (6,4) occupied by the snake's body?\n    - Checking the body segments: no (6,4) in the list.\n  - Is (6,4) an internal obstacle? No.\n  - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Right to (6,4).\n\n### Comparing Safe Moves: D vs. R\n\nNow, between Down to (5,3) and Right to (6,4), which is better?\n\n**Food Considerations**:\n- Neither (5,3) nor (6,4) have food currently.\n- Nearby food:\n  - (6,5) is at (6,5) with value=7, but it's currently under the tail (tail is at (6,5)).\n    - To eat this, we'd need to move away from the tail and then back, but it's risky because the food's life_span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn.\n    - Not feasible to eat this turn.\n  - Other foods are too far to consider for immediate next move.\n\n**Future Path Considerations**:\n- Moving Down to (5,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,3): U (back to (5,4)), D (to (5,2)), L (to (4,3)), R (to (6,3)).\n  - (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so D is blocked.\n  - U is reverse (from D to U), which may not be allowed next turn (depends on rules, but generally not instant reverse).\n  - So, likely next moves would be L or R.\n  \n- Moving Right to (6,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,4): U (to (6,5)), D (to (6,3)), L (to (5,4)), R (to (7,4)).\n    - R to (7,4): x=7 is a wall, so blocked.\n    - U to (6,5): currently has food under tail (value=7), but tail will move if we don't eat now, so next turn (6,5) may be free.\n    - But food at (6,5) will disappear after this turn (life_span=1), so next turn it's gone.\n    - So, next moves would be D or L.\n\nNeither immediate move leads directly to food, but moving Right seems slightly better because:\n- From (6,4), we can go Down to (6,3) next, which is closer to the food at (6,2) (value=4), though it also disappears after this turn.\n- Moving Down to (5,3) seems to corner us a bit more.\n\nHowever, both moves are safe and don't lead to immediate food. Since no food is accessible this turn without dying, the primary goal is to stay alive and position for future moves.\n\nGiven that, both moves are equally safe, but moving Right seems to keep more options open for the next move.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Opportunities\n\nIs there any food we can eat this turn safely?\n- (5,5): deadly, as discussed.\n- (6,5): under tail, can't eat unless tail moves away first.\n- Others are too far.\n\nSo, no safe food to eat this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (Down and Right), Right seems slightly better for future flexibility. \n\nBut let's double-check the tail movement:\n- Current tail is at (6,5). If we move Right to (6,4), the tail will move forward (since the snake doesn't grow), so the segment at (6,5) will be removed, and the new tail will be at (6,6).\n- Then, next turn, (6,5) is free, but the food there will be gone (life_span=1).\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (5,3) is also safe and doesn't lead to immediate danger.\n\nGiven that, both are equally safe, and since no food is immediately accessible, either is fine. I'll choose Right to keep the snake moving in its current direction where possible.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's head is at (6, 5), and its body follows as:\n- Head: (6, 5)\n- Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1.

Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we must check for \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - Is there positive food on the tail? The tail is at (6, 6), and the food is at (6, 2) and (1, 3), so no food on the tail.\n   - Therefore, moving into the tail is safe here.\n   - However, after moving to (6, 6), the tail would move from (6, 6) to (6, 5), but (6, 5) is where the head is moving from, so no immediate collision.\n   - But let's see the new snake positions after moving U:\n     - New head: (6, 6)\n     - Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), ..., (5, 6)] — the tail (6, 6) is removed.\n     - The new tail is (5, 6).\n   - No collision occurs here.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5, 5)**:\n   - (5, 5) is empty, no food, no walls, no body parts.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't lead to eating food immediately.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (7, 5)**:\n   - x=7 is a border wall, so invalid.\n\n### Considering Food\n\n- Food at (6, 2): \n  - To reach (6, 2) from (6, 5), we'd need to move down three times: (6,5)->(6,4)->(6,3)->(6,2).\n  - But currently, we can't move down because it's an instant reverse from Up.\n  - Next turn, if we move left to (5,5), then we could consider moving down, but it's not immediately helpful.\n\n- Food at (1, 3):\n  - Far away, not immediately reachable.\n\n### Immediate Best Move\n\nGiven the options:\n- Move U: Safe, into tail, but no immediate benefit.\n- Move L: Safe, empty cell, but no immediate benefit.\n  \nBetween these, moving Left seems slightly better because:\n- Moving Up into the tail doesn't provide any advantage, and the snake is quite long already (length 14).\n- Moving Left opens up more possibilities for future moves, perhaps towards the food at (1, 3) eventually.\n\nHowever, moving Up is also safe and doesn't lead to any immediate issues. But since the snake is long, avoiding unnecessary risks is good, and moving Left seems like a neutral, safe option.\n\nBut wait, moving Up into the tail is also safe here because there's no food on the tail to cause \"Tail Reward Danger\". \n\nActually, both moves are safe, but moving Left might be slightly better for future flexibility.\n\nBut looking at the snake's body, moving Left to (5,5) is adjacent to (5,4) and (5,6), which are body parts, but not directly in the path. \n\nAlternatively, moving Up to (6,6) is the tail, and since the tail moves away, it's safe.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe, and neither leads to food immediately, perhaps moving Left is better to start moving towards the center where more options might be available later.\n\nBut the snake is very long and coiled, so moving Left might not be significantly better than Up.\n\nGiven that, and since the snake is moving Up, continuing Up is also reasonable.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Danger\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that could be dangerous?\n- The food is at (6,2) and (1,3), neither is under the snake's body currently.\n- So no danger from that.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth Up and Left are safe, with no immediate advantage. Since the snake is moving Up, continuing Up is acceptable, but moving Left might offer slightly more future flexibility. \n\nHowever, given the snake's length and the current position, moving Left to (5,5) seems like a neutral, safe choice that doesn't box us in.\n\nBut actually, moving Up is also fine, and since the tail is at (6,6), moving there is safe and doesn't cause any issues.\n\nGiven that, and since no immediate food is at risk, either is fine. \n\nGiven the symmetry, I'll choose Left to start moving towards the center.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So moving left would collide with the body.\n   - **Conclusion**: Not safe, would collide with body.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5,6)**:\n   - Check if (5,6) is in body segments:\n     - (5,6) is the last segment (tail). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we have to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - If the tail has positive food and the head is adjacent to the tail, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n       - Is there food at (5,6)? Looking at food positions: (6,2), (1,3), (3,1) — no food at (5,6).\n       - So no danger from tail food.\n   - Also, (5,6) is not a wall.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Up.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check if (5,4) is in body segments:\n     - (5,4) is the 4th segment from the head.\n   - **Conclusion**: Not safe, would collide with body.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go for.\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (6,2): value=1, life=2 — at turn 58, disappears at turn 60. Distance from head (5,5):\n   - Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4. Can't reach in 2 turns (disappears at turn 60, current is 58, so 2 turns left).\n   - **Not reachable before it disappears**.\n\n2. (1,3): value=1, life=7 — disappears at turn 65. Distance:\n   - |1-5| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6. We have 7 turns to reach it, so possible but not immediately.\n\n3. (3,1): value=1, life=10 — disappears at turn 68. Distance:\n   - |3-5| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6. We have 10 turns to reach it, so possible but not immediately.\n\nGiven that no food is immediately reachable in the next move, our primary goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning ourselves to potentially reach food in future turns.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head or Adjacent\n\nIs there any food under the head or adjacent that we can eat next turn?\n\n- Head at (5,5). Adjacent cells:\n  - Left (4,5): no food listed.\n  - Right (6,5): no food listed.\n  - Up (5,6): no food listed.\n  - Down (5,4): no food listed.\n\nNo immediate food to eat in the next move.\n\n### Decision\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Left (L): collides with body — unsafe.\n- Down (D): collides with body — unsafe.\n- Up (U): safe, moves to (5,6), which is the current tail position, but no food there and no collision risk.\n\nRight (R) is not allowed because it's an instant reverse from Left.\n\n**Best immediate action**: Move Up (U).\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement\n\nAfter moving Up to (5,6):\n- New head position: (5,6)\n- Current tail is at (5,6), which will move away (the segment before tail is (4,6), so tail moves to (4,6)).\n- New snake positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n   - The old tail at (5,6) is now the head, and the new tail is at (4,6).\n   - No immediate collision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and only viable move at this turn is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

From here, the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (5,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so this is invalid (collision).\n- Down (D): (5,5) — but this is the opposite of current direction (U), and instant reverse is not allowed.\n- Left (L): (4,6).\n- Right (R): (6,6).\n\nSo, valid moves are Left (L) and Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Left (L) to (4,6)\n\nLet's check if moving Left to (4,6) is safe and beneficial.\n\n1. **Collision Check**:\n   - (4,6) is in the snake's body: looking at the positions, (4,6) is the last segment (tail). \n   - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we need to check if eating food there causes issues.\n   - Is there food at (4,6)? Checking the food positions: no, none of the foods are at (4,6).\n   - So, moving to (4,6) is safe in terms of collision (tail will move away).\n\n2. **Food Check**:\n   - No food at (4,6), so no score change.\n\n3. **Future Implications**:\n   - After moving left, the new head is at (4,6), and the tail (4,6) will move away (since the snake moves forward, the last segment is removed unless we eat food).\n   - Next possible moves from (4,6) would be U, D, L, R, but we'd have to avoid reversing (so not D if we moved U, etc.).\n\n### Evaluating Right (R) to (6,6)\n\nNow, let's check moving Right to (6,6).\n\n1. **Collision Check**:\n   - (6,6) is not in the snake's body (checking the positions list).\n   - Not a wall (x=6 is not a border unless y is 0 or 7; y=6 is fine).\n   - No internal obstacle at (6,6).\n   - So, (6,6) is safe to move to.\n\n2. **Food Check**:\n   - No food at (6,6), so no score change.\n\n3. **Future Implications**:\n   - New head at (6,6), tail moves away.\n   - Next moves would be from (6,6), avoiding reverse (so not L).\n\n### Comparing Left and Right\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of not colliding immediately. Neither leads to eating food this turn. \n\nBut let's look at the food positions to see which move might set us up better for future food:\n\n1. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases this turn).\n   - Currently at turn 59, next turn it's gone.\n   - So, not reachable in time.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Life_span=6, so it will disappear at turn 59 + 6 = turn 65.\n   - Distance from current head (5,6) to (1,3):\n     - Need to move left (decrease x) and down (decrease y).\n     - At least |5-1| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7 moves away.\n     - But life_span is 6, so we can't reach it in time.\n\n3. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Life_span=9, disappears at turn 59 + 9 = turn 68.\n   - Distance from (5,6) to (3,1):\n     - |5-3| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7 moves.\n   - So, we can reach it by turn 66 (7 moves), but it disappears at turn 68, so possible.\n   - Path: need to go left and down.\n\nGiven that, moving Left (to (4,6)) seems better because it starts us moving towards (3,1), whereas moving Right takes us away.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left to (4,6)?\n\n- The cell (4,6) is the current tail. Moving into the tail is safe unless there's positive food there that would make the snake grow into itself.\n- But there's no food at (4,6), so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving Right to (6,6) is also safe, but as discussed, not helpful for future food.\n\n### Potential Oversights\n\nWait, is (4,6) really the tail? Let me check the snake positions again:\n\nSnake Positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nSo, the tail is indeed (4,6). Moving into it is safe because the tail will move away (unless we eat food there, which we're not).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween Left and Right, Left is better because:\n- Both are safe.\n- Left starts moving us towards the only reachable food at (3,1).\n- Right takes us away from that food.\n\nUp is invalid (wall), Down is invalid (instant reverse).\n\nTherefore, the best action is to move Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Here, the head is at (4, 6), followed by the body segments.\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Left (`L`).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - (1, 3): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     - (3, 1): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's body and the food positions.\n\n**Snake Body**:\n- Head: (4, 6)\n- Next segments: (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5)\n  \nThis seems like a long snake with many twists and turns. The head is at (4,6), moving left, which means it's moving towards decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (1, 3): Positive food (value=6), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten).\n2. (3, 1): Positive food (value=8), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (`U`), Down (`D`), Left (`L`), Right (`R`). However, since it's currently moving left (`L`), it cannot instantly reverse to right (`R`) in the next move. So, possible immediate moves are `U`, `D`, or `L`.\n\nLet's explore each possible move from the head's current position (4,6):\n\n1. **Left (`L`)**: (x-1, y) → (3,6)\n   - Check if (3,6) is occupied by the snake's body or is a wall.\n   - Snake body segments: (5,6), (5,5), ..., (3,6) is the 12th segment (counting from 0: head is 0, next is 1, etc.).\n   - Wait, (3,6) is part of the snake's body (it's the 11th segment in the list if we start counting from 0 for the head).\n   - Moving left would make the head collide with its own body at (3,6), which is deadly. So, `L` is invalid.\n\n2. **Up (`U`)**: (x, y+1) → (4,7)\n   - y=7 is a border wall. So, moving up would hit the wall, which is deadly. `U` is invalid.\n\n3. **Down (`D`)**: (x, y-1) → (4,5)\n   - Check if (4,5) is part of the snake's body or a wall.\n   - Snake body includes (4,5) as the last segment in the list (13th segment if counting from 0).\n   - However, the tail is at (4,5). Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - If the head moves to (4,5), and if (4,5) has positive food, eating it would make the snake grow, so the new tail would be at the previous tail position, which is (3,5), and the head would be at (4,5), which doesn't immediately collide.\n     - But currently, (4,5) doesn't have food (food is at (1,3) and (3,1)), so no danger of eating food at the tail.\n   - Therefore, moving down to (4,5) is safe because the tail will move away, and there's no food there to cause a collision upon growth.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move from the current head position (4,6):\n\n1. Food at (1,3):\n   - Distance from (4,6) is |4-1| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps away. Not reachable in one move.\n2. Food at (3,1):\n   - Distance from (4,6) is |4-3| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps away. Not reachable in one move.\n\nSince no food is immediately adjacent to the head, the primary goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom earlier:\n- `L`: Collision with body at (3,6) → Invalid\n- `U`: Wall at y=7 → Invalid\n- `D`: Moves to (4,5), which is the tail.

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at Turn 61.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - One internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,5), followed by body segments in order.\n   - Current direction: Down (D), meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 5\n   - (3, 1): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (1, 5): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (4,4) — but the snake's body is at (4,4), which is the tail's position after the next move. Wait, let's see the body segments:\n  - Current body: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), ..., (3,5)]\n  - After moving, the tail (last segment) moves away, so (4,4) is currently occupied by the 8th segment (from head: head is 1st, then 2nd is (4,6), etc.). Wait, counting:\n    - (4,5) - head\n    - (4,6) - next\n    - (5,6)\n    - (5,5)\n    - (6,5)\n    - (6,4)\n    - (5,4)\n    - (4,4) — this is the 8th segment. The tail is at (3,5), which is the 14th segment (since the snake has 14 segments).\n    - So moving down to (4,4) would collide with the 8th segment, which is not the tail. That's a body collision — deadly.\n    - **Down is invalid** (collides with body).\n  \n- **Left (L)**: (3,5) — currently occupied by the tail (last segment). Moving here is safe because the tail will move away when the head moves here.\n  \n- **Right (R)**: (5,5) — currently occupied by the 4th segment. This is not the tail, so it's a body collision — deadly.\n  \n- **Up (U)**: (4,6) — currently occupied by the 2nd segment. Body collision — deadly.\n\nWait, but the current direction is D (down). The rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. The opposite of down is up. So moving up is not allowed because it's an instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves without instant reverse:\n- Down (D): invalid (body collision)\n- Left (L): valid (tail)\n- Right (R): invalid (body collision)\n- Up (U): invalid (instant reverse)\n\nWait, is moving left allowed? The current direction is down, and left is not opposite to down (opposite is up). So left is allowed.\n\nBut is moving left safe? It's moving to (3,5), which is the tail. The tail will move away when the head moves there, so it's safe.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head (4,5):\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - Up (4,6): has food? No, it's the snake's body.\n  - Down (4,4): has food? No, it's the snake's body.\n  - Left (3,5): has food? Checking food positions:\n    - (1,3), (3,1), (1,5) — no, (3,5) has no food.\n  - Right (5,5): has food? No, it's the snake's body.\n\nNo adjacent food to eat immediately.\n\n### Potential Moves\n\nOnly valid move is Left (L) to (3,5).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after moving left to (3,5), the tail is at (3,5), which will move away. The new head is at (3,5), and the tail was at (3,5), but the tail moves to the next segment's previous position, which is (2,4). So no collision.\n\nNext possible moves from (3,5):\n- Current direction is now Left (since we moved left).\n- Possible moves:\n  - Left (L): (2,5) — currently occupied by the 11th segment (from head count). Not tail — body collision.\n  - Down (D): (3,4) — currently occupied by the 9th segment. Body collision.\n  - Up (U): (3,6) — currently occupied by the 13th segment. Body collision.\n  - Right (R): (4,5) — opposite of left, so instant reverse — invalid.\n  \nSo after moving left, all next moves are invalid except possibly right, which is reverse and not allowed. So moving left leads to a dead end.\n\nIs there any other option? Currently, the only valid move is left. Maybe we missed something.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the initial possible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (4,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n- D: (4,4) — body at (4,4) (8th segment) — collision.\n- L: (3,5) — tail — safe.\n- R: (5,5) — body at (5,5) (4th segment) — collision.\n- U: (4,6) — body at (4,6) (2nd segment) — collision and instant reverse.\n\nOnly left is valid, but leads to dead end.\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that we can eat by moving away and then back?\n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (1,3), (3,1), (1,5) — none under the snake's body.\n\nSo no hidden food to uncover.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid move is Left (L), even though it leads to a dead end next turn. But maybe the snake can survive longer by moving left now and hoping for new food to appear or other opportunities.\n\nAlternatively, is there any way to not move left? No, other moves are invalid due to collision or instant reverse.\n\nTherefore, the only possible action is to move Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), with borders at these limits. There's also an internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n- Head: (3, 5)\n- Body segments: (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L), meaning its last move was from (4,5) to (3,5).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1, 3): value = +1, life_span = 4\n2. (3, 1): value = +1, life_span = 6\n3. (1, 5): value = +1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5) moving Left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- Up (U): (3, 6)\n- Down (D): (3, 4)\n- Left (L): (2, 5)\n- Right (R): (4, 5)\n\nHowever, since the snake is currently moving Left, it cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, the allowed moves are U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (3, 6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (3,6) is part of the snake's body (the tail segment). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check if this is the immediate tail or not.\n  - The tail is at (3,6), which is the last segment. If the head moves to (3,6), the tail will move away from (3,6), so no collision.\n  - However, we must also consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n  - Currently, (3,6) is the tail and does not have food (food is at (1,3), (3,1), (1,5)), so no danger here.\n- Food: No food at (3,6).\n- Safety: Safe to move here.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (3, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (3,4) is part of the snake's body (positions: ..., (3,4), ...). It's not the immediate tail, so moving here would collide with the body.\n- Safety: Unsafe, would collide with body.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L) to (2, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (2,5) is part of the snake's body (positions: ..., (2,5), ...). It's not the immediate tail, so moving here would collide with the body.\n- Safety: Unsafe, would collide with body.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R) to (4, 5)\n- Normally, moving Right is not allowed because it's the opposite of Left (instant reverse is prohibited).\n- But let's confirm: current direction is Left, so Right is opposite → illegal move.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only legal and safe move is Up (U) to (3,6). \n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other consideration:\n- The tail is at (3,6), and the head moving there is safe because the tail will move away.\n- No food is at (3,6), so no growth, just moving safely.\n\nIs there any other move we're missing? \n\nWait, the snake is at [(3,5), (4,5), ...], so moving Left was from (4,5) to (3,5). The next possible moves are U, D, L (R is opposite). \n\nWe've checked U (safe), D and L (both collide with body). So U is the only option.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nIs there any food we can reach soon?\n- (1,3): To reach this, from (3,5), we'd need to go Left to (2,5) (but unsafe), then Left to (1,5), then Down to (1,4), then Down to (1,3). Not immediately helpful.\n- (3,1): From (3,5), need to go Down to (3,4) (unsafe), then continue Down.\n- (1,5): From (3,5), Left to (2,5) (unsafe), then Left to (1,5).\n\nNo immediate food can be reached safely in the next move. Therefore, the best immediate action is to move safely to (3,6).\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), the tail is currently at (3,6). The tail will move forward, which is the segment before it: (2,6). So the new tail will be at (2,6), and (3,6) will be the new head position. This is safe because the tail moves away from (3,6) as the head arrives.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and legal move at this turn is Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 63 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — can't move here.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]\n  - Head at (3,6), direction is Up (U).\n  - Length: 14 segments.\n- Current direction: Up (U). This means last move was upwards (from (3,5) to (3,6)).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Three food items:\n  1. (1,3): value=1, life_span=3\n  2. (3,1): value=1, life_span=5\n  3. (1,5): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,6) facing Up (U), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3,7) — but y=7 is a wall. **Invalid** (wall collision).\n- **Down (D)**: (3,5) — opposite of current direction. **Invalid** (no instant reverse).\n- **Left (L)**: (2,6)\n- **Right (R)**: (4,6)\n\nSo, valid moves are Left (L) and Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Left (L) to (2,6)\n\nLet's check (2,6):\n- Is it a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, and internal (5,2). Safe.\n- Is it part of the snake's body?\n  - Snake body segments: (3,5), (4,5), ..., (2,6) is the last segment (tail).\n  - Moving to (2,6) is the tail. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we must check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Is there positive food at (2,6)?\n      - Current food positions: (1,3), (3,1), (1,5). No food at (2,6).\n    - So, no danger from tail food.\n- Any food at (2,6)? No.\n- Safety: Safe to move here.\n\n### Evaluating Right (R) to (4,6)\n\nNow, (4,6):\n- Is it a wall? No.\n- Is it part of the snake's body?\n  - Snake body: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), etc. (4,6) is the 4th segment.\n  - Moving here would collide with the body. **Deadly collision**.\n- So, Right is **invalid**.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nSince Left is the only valid move, but is there any food to consider?\n- Nearest foods:\n  1. (1,3): distance from (3,6) is |3-1| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n  2. (3,1): |3-3| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n  3. (1,5): |3-1| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- Closest is (1,5), distance 3.\n  - Current move to (2,6) doesn't directly help reach (1,5), but next moves could.\n  - (1,5) is at (1,5), life_span=8, so it'll disappear at turn 63 + 8 = 71.\n- Other foods have longer distances and similar life spans.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Left to (2,6)\n\nAfter moving left to (2,6), next head position is (2,6), coming from (3,6) (direction Left).\nNext possible moves:\n- From (2,6), last move was Left (from (3,6)), so can't go Right (instant reverse).\n- Possible: Up (2,7) — wall, invalid.\n- Down (2,5) — check:\n  - (2,5) is in snake body (from current state, it's the 13th segment). But after moving left, the tail (2,6) moves away, and (2,5) might not be part of the body anymore. Need to simulate:\n    - Current body: [(3,6), (3,5), ..., (2,6)]\n    - After moving left: head to (2,6), tail (last segment) moves away (original tail was (2,6), but since length increases only when eating positive food, and we're not eating now, length stays same, so tail moves away from (2,6) to where? Wait, no: when not eating, tail moves forward, so the segment before tail moves to tail's position.\n    - Original body: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]\n    - After moving left (head to (2,6)), tail (2,6) is removed, new body:\n      - [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), ..., (2,5)]\n    - So (2,5) is still in the body (second last segment). So moving Down to (2,5) would collide. **Invalid**.\n- Left (1,6) — check:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not in new body (after left move, body is [(2,6), (3,6), ..., (2,5)], so (1,6) is not in it.\n  - Safe.\n  - Food at (1,5) is below (1,6), so could move down next to reach it.\n\nSo moving Left now allows potential to reach (1,5) by going Left then Down.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any immediate food to eat?\n- Current head at (3,6), food at (1,3), (3,1), (1,5). None adjacent to (3,6).\n- So no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nAfter moving Left to (2,6), is there any immediate danger next turn?\n- As calculated, can go Left to (1,6) next, then Down to (1,5) to eat food.\n- No immediate threats visible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly valid move is Left (L) to (2,6), which is safe and opens a path towards the closest food at (1,5).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 64. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: There's one at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (1,3): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (3,1): value=4, life_span=1\n   - (1,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (4,6): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,6), moving Left (L). From the head's position (2,6), the possible moves are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (1,6)\n- **Up (U)**: (2,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (2,5)\n\nWe cannot move Right (R) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (Left), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\nSo, possible moves: Left to (1,6) or Down to (2,5).\n\n### Checking Possible Moves for Safety and Rewards\n\n**Option 1: Move Left to (1,6)**\n\n- Is (1,6) a wall? x=1 is not a border wall, and there's no internal obstacle at (1,6). So, not a wall.\n- Is (1,6) part of the snake's body? Let's check the snake's positions:\n  - The snake's body segments are from (3,6) onwards. (1,6) is not in the list, so safe.\n- Is there food at (1,6)? Checking the food positions:\n  - (1,3), (3,1), (1,5), (4,6) — no food at (1,6).\n  \nSo, moving Left is safe but doesn't get us food.\n\n**Option 2: Move Down to (2,5)**\n\n- Is (2,5) a wall? No, it's not a border or internal obstacle.\n- Is (2,5) part of the snake's body? Looking at the snake's positions:\n  - The last segment is (2,5). The tail is at (2,5).\n  \nNow, here's a special rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So, moving to (2,5) is safe because the tail will move away.\n\nIs there food at (2,5)? No, the food positions don't include (2,5).\n\nWait, actually, the snake's positions include (2,5) as the tail. Is there food under the tail? The food positions are:\n\n- (1,3), (3,1), (1,5), (4,6) — none at (2,5), so no food to eat here.\n\nBut let's think about the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Here, the head is at (2,6), tail at (2,5), so they are adjacent (directly below). But there's no food at (2,5), so no danger.\n\nSo, moving Down is also safe but doesn't get us food.\n\n### Comparing Left and Down Moves\n\nBoth moves are safe, but neither leads directly to food. However, let's think about future moves:\n\n- If we move Left to (1,6), next possible moves from there:\n  - Current direction would be Left, so can't move Right.\n  - From (1,6), possible moves:\n    - Left: (0,6) — x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n    - Up: (1,7) — y=7 is a wall, invalid.\n    - Down: (1,5)\n  \n  So, only Down to (1,5) is possible next. At (1,5), there is food with value=7. But can we eat it?\n\n  - Food at (1,5) is under the snake's body? The snake's body doesn't currently include (1,5), but the tail is at (2,5). So (1,5) is not under the snake's body now, but if we move to (1,6) then (1,5), the head would be at (1,5), which is food. But is the body moving away?\n\n  Wait, the food under body rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\n  Currently, is (1,5) under the snake's body? No, the snake's body is at (3,6), (3,5), etc., not (1,5). So the food at (1,5) is not under the body now, so we can eat it by moving the head there directly.\n\n  But to get to (1,5), we'd need to go Left to (1,6), then Down to (1,5). That's two moves, but the food's life_span is 1, so next turn it will disappear (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So by Turn 65, the food at (1,5) will be gone. So we can't get it.\n\n- If we move Down to (2,5), next possible moves:\n  - Current direction would be Down, so can't move Up.\n  - From (2,5), possible moves:\n    - Left: (1,5) — food with value=7, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn, so can't get it).\n    - Down: (2,4) — part of the snake's body (from the list: ..., (2,4), (2,5)), so collision unless it's the tail.\n      - The tail is currently at (2,5), and after moving Down to (2,5), the new tail would be the second last segment, which is (2,4). So moving to (2,4) would collide with the new tail (since the tail moves from (2,5) to (2,4) as the head moves to (2,5)), so that's a collision.\n    - Right: (3,5) — part of the body (from list: (3,6), (3,5), ...), so collision.\n\n  So from (2,5), only possible move is Left to (1,5), but food there disappears next turn.\n\n### Other Food Options\n\nOther foods:\n\n- (1,3): value=2, life_span=1 — will disappear next turn, can't reach in one move from (2,6).\n- (3,1): value=4, life_span=1 — same.\n- (4,6): value=10, life_span=1 — at (4,6), which is part of the snake's body (from list: (4,6) is the 5th segment). To eat it:\n  - The body must move away, and head move onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is at (2,6), body goes to (4,6). To have (4,6) free, the snake would need to move in a way that the segment at (4,6) moves away, which isn't possible in one move.\n  \nSo none of the foods are reachable in this turn to eat.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Down\n\nBoth moves are safe, neither leads to food this turn. Which is better?\n\nLooking at future moves:\n\n- Left to (1,6):\n  - Next turn only can move Down to (1,5), but food there disappears.\n  - Then stuck unless the snake can turn, but seems like a dead end.\n\n- Down to (2,5):\n  - Next turn can only move Left to (1,5), but food disappears.\n  - Then stuck.\n\nBoth seem equally bad in terms of future moves, but moving Down keeps the snake more centered, which might be better for future opportunities.\n\nAlternatively, is there any immediate danger in moving Left or Down?\n\nMoving Left to (1,6):\n- Next to wall at x=0, but not immediately dangerous.\n\nMoving Down to (2,5):\n- Adjacent to tail, but no food there, so no danger.\n\nGiven that, both are safe, but perhaps Down is slightly better because it keeps the snake more towards the center, giving more options in the future if new food appears.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's length (14 segments), it\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- **Positions (head first):** \n  - Head: (1, 6)\n  - Body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]\n- **Current Direction:** Left (L)\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n  1. (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 1\n  2. (3, 1): value = 1, life_span = 3\n  3. (1, 5): value = 1, life_span = 6\n  4. (4, 6): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (1, 6) with Direction L\n\nFrom the current head position (1, 6) moving left (L), the next possible moves are:\n- **Left (L):** (0, 6) → x=0 is a wall → **Invalid (wall collision)**\n- **Up (U):** (1, 7) → y=7 is a wall → **Invalid (wall collision)**\n- **Down (D):** (1, 5)\n- **Right (R):** (2, 6) → Opposite of current direction (L) → **Invalid (instant reverse not allowed)**\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Down (D)** to (1, 5).\n\n### Checking the Down Move (1, 5)\n\nLet's see what's at (1, 5):\n- **Food:** There's a food at (1, 5) with value = 1, life_span = 6.\n  \nNow, let's check if eating this food is safe:\n- **Tail Position:** The tail is at (2, 4).\n- After moving down to (1, 5), the new head is at (1, 5), and the tail will move forward, so the old tail (2, 4) will be removed, and the new tail will be the next segment, which is (3, 4).\n- The food is at (1, 5), same as the new head position, so it will be eaten.\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be the old tail (2, 4) is not removed, and the new tail is now (2, 4).\n  \nNow, check for **Tail Reward Danger**:\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail after eating?\n  - New head: (1, 5)\n  - New tail: (2, 4)\n  - Adjacent means they share an edge (not diagonal). (1,5) and (2,4) are diagonally adjacent (they share a corner), not edge-adjacent.\n  - Edge adjacency: (x same, y differs by 1) or (y same, x differs by 1).\n  - Here, x differs by 1 and y differs by 1 → not edge-adjacent.\n  - So, no tail reward danger.\n\n**Is (1,5) part of the body?**\n- Current body segments: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]\n- (1,5) is not in the body → no body collision.\n\n**Is (1,5) a wall?**\n- No, it's not listed as a wall.\n\nSo, moving Down to (1,5) is safe and allows eating positive food.\n\n### Are There Other Valid Moves?\n\nFrom the initial analysis, the only valid move is Down. But let's double-check if there's any other possible move we missed.\n\nCurrent head at (1,6), direction L.\nPossible moves:\n- Left: (0,6) → wall\n- Up: (1,7) → wall\n- Down: (1,5) → valid\n- Right: (2,6) → opposite direction → invalid\n\nSo, only Down is valid.\n\n### Verifying Food at (1,5)\n\nFood at (1,5):\n- Value: +1\n- Life_span: 6\n- It's positive food, so eating it is beneficial unless it causes a collision next turn, which it doesn't here.\n\n### Checking Future Implications\n\nAfter moving Down to (1,5):\n- Snake grows by 1, new length is 15 (current length is 14).\n- New positions:\n  - Head: (1,5)\n  - Body: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\n  \nNext possible moves from (1,5), direction D:\n- Left: (0,5) → wall\n- Down: (1,4)\n- Up: (1,6) → body segment (but (1,6) is the first body segment after head moves to (1,5), so moving up would collide with body → invalid\n- Right: (2,5) → not opposite direction (current is D, right is not opposite)\n\nSo next possible moves would be Down or Right, but that's for future turns.\n\n### Are There Better Options?\n\nIs there any way to reach other foods?\n- (1,3): life_span=1, so it will disappear next turn. Currently at turn 65, it's there at 65, gone at 66. Can't reach it in one move from (1,6).\n- (3,1): life_span=3. Too far to reach now.\n- (4,6): life_span=9. Currently at (4,6) is a body segment (the 6th segment: (4,6)). So, unless the body moves away, can't eat it now. Even if it moves away, it's not reachable in one move from (1,6).\n\nSo, (1,5) is the only accessible food now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move is Down (D) to (1,5), which allows eating the positive food there without causing any collisions or dangers.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

From Down, the possible moves are:\n- Continue Down (D): (1, 4).\n- Turn Left (L): (0, 5) — but x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- Turn Right (R): (2, 5).\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of Down (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nSo, possible moves from current position and direction:\n- Down (D): (1, 4).\n- Right (R): (2, 5).\n\nLet's evaluate these options.\n\n### Evaluating Move Down (D) to (1, 4)\n\n1. **Check for Collisions**:\n   - Wall: y=4 is not a wall.\n   - Body: Look at snake positions. The body segments are from (1,6) to (2,4). (1,4) is not in the body list, so no collision.\n   - Tail: The tail is at (2,4). Moving to (1,4) is adjacent to the tail, but not the same cell, so no immediate collision.\n   \n2. **Check for Food**:\n   - No food at (1,4).\n   \n3. **Safety**:\n   - Next moves from (1,4) with direction D:\n     - Can go D: (1,3) — check if it's safe.\n     - Can go L: (0,4) — wall, invalid.\n     - Can go R: (2,4) — currently tail is at (2,4), but tail will move forward if we grow, but we're not growing here, so tail moves away, making (2,4) safe unless we grow next time.\n   - Seems safe for now.\n\n### Evaluating Move Right (R) to (2, 5)\n\n1. **Check for Collisions**:\n   - Wall: x=2 is not a wall.\n   - Body: Check if (2,5) is in snake positions. Looking at the list: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). (2,5) is not in the list, so no collision.\n   \n2. **Check for Food**:\n   - No food at (2,5).\n   \n3. **Safety**:\n   - Next moves from (2,5) with direction R (since we turned right from down, new direction is R):\n     - Can go R: (3,5) — check snake positions: (3,5) is in the body (4th position from head), but depends on movement.\n     - Can go U: (2,6) — in body (second segment).\n     - Can go D: (2,4) — tail is at (2,4), but tail moves if we don't grow.\n   - Moving to (2,5) seems safe, but next moves might be constrained.\n\n### Comparing Both Moves\n\n- **Down (D) to (1,4)**:\n  - No food.\n  - Safe move, opens up future options.\n  \n- **Right (R) to (2,5)**:\n  - No food.\n  - Also safe, but next moves might be more constrained due to body positions.\n\nBoth moves seem safe, but neither leads to immediate food. Let's look at the food positions to see if one move might lead us closer to food in future turns.\n\n### Food Positions\n\n1. **(3,1)**:\n   - Value: +1, life_span: 3.\n   - Current turn is 66, so disappears at turn 69.\n   - Distance from head (1,5):\n     - Manhattan distance: |3-1| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n   \n2. **(4,6)**:\n   - Value: +1, life_span: 8.\n   - Disappears at turn 74.\n   - Distance from head (1,5):\n     - |4-1| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n(4,6) is closer. Let's see how to reach it.\n\nFrom (1,5):\n- To reach (4,6), need to go right and up.\nCurrent direction is D, so to go right is R to (2,5), then likely U to (2,6), then R to (3,6), then R to (4,6).\n\nBut let's check the path:\n- (1,5) -> R -> (2,5).\n- Next, can't go L (reverse), can go U or R.\n  - U to (2,6): but (2,6) is the second body segment. Moving there would collide unless the tail moves away.\n    - Current tail is at (2,4). If we don't eat, tail moves to next segment.\n    - Snake length is 15. If we don't eat, tail moves from (2,4) to (1,4) (since head was at (1,5), moved to (2,5), so body moves: (1,6)->(1,5), (2,6)->(1,6), etc., tail was (2,4), moves to where the next segment was, which is (3,4).\n    - Wait, let's see body movement:\n      - Original body: (1,6), (2,6), ..., (2,4).\n      - After moving head to (2,5), new body is (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), ..., (3,4).\n      - So (2,6) is still in the body after move.\n      - So moving U to (2,6) would collide with body.\n  - So from (2,5), can't go U, can go R to (3,5).\n    - (3,5) is in the body (original position (3,5)), but after move, it's (3,6)->(3,5), etc., so (3,5) is still in body.\n    - So moving R to (3,5) also collides.\n  \nSo moving R to (2,5) seems to lead to a dead end where next moves are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,5), D to (1,4):\n- Then can go D to (1,3), or R to (2,4).\n  - (2,4) is tail, but tail moves to (3,4), so safe.\n  - Then can go R to (3,4), which is new tail position, but tail moves to (4,4), so safe.\n  - Then can go U to (3,5), etc., working towards (4,6).\n\nThis path seems more promising to eventually reach (4,6).\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake\n\nThe food at (4,6) is under the snake's body (it's the 7th segment: (4,6)). To eat it:\n- Need body to move away, then head to move onto it.\n- Currently, (4,6) is occupied by body, so can't eat now.\n- Need to move such that in future, (4,6) is free and head can move there.\n\nThis seems complex and not immediately achievable in next few moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNeither immediate move leads to food, but moving Down (D) to (1,4) seems safer and opens up more future options to navigate towards the food at (4,6). Moving Right (R) seems to lead to a quicker dead end.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both possible moves, the safer and more strategic choice is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake's head is at (1, 4), moving Down (D).\n   - The body segments follow: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), ..., (3,4).\n   - Current direction is Down, so the snake is moving towards decreasing y.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (3, 1): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (4, 6): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6, 4): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (1,4) moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- **Continue Down (D)**: (1,3)\n- **Turn Left (L)**: (0,4) — but x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Turn Right (R)**: (2,4)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of current direction Down (D), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are:\n- Down (D) to (1,3)\n- Right (R) to (2,4)\n\n### Evaluating Move Options\n\n**Option 1: Move Down to (1,3)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (1,3) is within bounds (x=1 is not a wall, y=3 is not a wall).\n  - Body segments: The snake's body is at [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), ..., (3,4)]. (1,3) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- Food at (1,3)? No food listed there.\n- Safety: Moving Down seems safe; no immediate threats.\n\n**Option 2: Move Right to (2,4)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (2,4) is within bounds.\n  - Body segments: Is (2,4) in the body? Let's see the body positions: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). (2,4) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- Food at (2,4)? No food listed there.\n- Safety: Moving Right also seems safe.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if either move can lead us towards food in the near future.\n\n1. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Current position (1,4). To reach (3,1):\n     - Need to go Right twice (to x=3) and Down three times (from y=4 to y=1).\n     - Life span is 2, so it will disappear after Turn 68 (current is 67). Not reachable in time.\n   \n2. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Currently at (1,4). To reach (4,6):\n     - Need to go Right three times (to x=4) and Up two times (from y=4 to y=6).\n     - Life span is 7, so it will be there until Turn 73. Might be reachable.\n   \n3. **Food at (6,4)**:\n   - Currently at (1,4). To reach (6,4):\n     - Need to go Right five times (to x=6) and no change in y.\n     - Life span is 10, so until Turn 76. Reachable.\n\nBetween (4,6) and (6,4), (6,4) is further but has a longer life span. (4,6) is closer but requires moving Up, which is opposite to current Down direction, so would take some turns to adjust.\n\n### Immediate Move Decision\n\nGiven that both immediate moves (Down to (1,3) or Right to (2,4)) are safe and don't lead to food directly, which is better for future food collection?\n\n- Moving Down to (1,3):\n  - Next moves could be Right to (2,3), then Right to (3,3), etc., heading towards (6,4).\n  \n- Moving Right to (2,4):\n  - Next moves could be Right to (3,4), but (3,4) is the tail. Wait, is (3,4) the tail?\n    - Snake positions: head is (1,4), tail is the last in the list: (3,4).\n    - So moving to (2,4), then (3,4) would have the head at (3,4) where the tail is currently.\n    - But the tail will move away when the head moves there, so this is safe unless there's food under the tail with \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n    - Checking food under tail (3,4): No food listed at (3,4), so safe.\n    - Then can continue Right to (4,4), etc., towards (6,4).\n\nBetween the two, moving Right seems more directly towards the food at (6,4). Moving Down would take us away from the row where (6,4) is.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could cause Tail Reward Danger if we move towards it?\n- Tail is at (3,4). Is there food at (3,4)? No.\n- So no danger from that.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween Down and Right:\n- Down is safe but takes us away from the food's row.\n- Right is safe and starts moving towards the food at (6,4).\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

No. Safe.\n\nAll three possible moves are safe from immediate collision.\n\n### Checking Food Availability\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head or in the path:\n\n1. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Distance from head (2,4): |3-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4. Not adjacent.\n2. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Distance: |4-2| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4. Not adjacent.\n3. **Food at (6,4)**:\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |4-4| = 4 + 0 = 4. Not adjacent.\n\nNone of the food is adjacent to the head right now. However, the snake's body is covering some cells where food might be underneath, but since the head isn't adjacent to those, we don't need to consider them for immediate eating.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately adjacent, the priority is to move in a direction that:\n- Doesn't lead to a dead end.\n- Keeps options open for future moves.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (3,4)**:\n   - From (3,4), possible next moves:\n     - Right (R) to (4,4): Check if (4,4) is in body. Yes, (4,4) is the tail. But since the tail will move, it's safe unless we're eating food there, which we're not.\n     - Up (U) to (3,5): (3,5) is in the body (from current state). Collision.\n     - Down (D) to (3,3): Not in body, not a wall. Safe.\n   - So from (3,4), can go R or D next.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (2,5)**:\n   - From (2,5), possible next moves:\n     - Right (R) to (3,5): (3,5) is in body. Collision.\n     - Up (U) to (2,6): (2,6) is in body. Collision.\n     - Left (L): Opposite of current direction (R), not allowed.\n   - Only possible move is Left, which is invalid. So moving U leads to a dead end next turn.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (2,3)**:\n   - From (2,3), possible next moves:\n     - Right (R) to (3,3): Safe.\n     - Down (D) to (2,2): Safe.\n     - Left (L): Opposite, not allowed.\n   - So from (2,3), can go R or D next.\n\n**Conclusion on Moves**:\n- Moving Up (U) leads to a dead end next turn.\n- Moving Right (R) or Down (D) keeps options open.\n\nBetween R and D:\n- Moving R to (3,4) is in the general direction of the food at (6,4), though it's not immediately adjacent.\n- Moving D to (2,3) is moving away from most food.\n\nThus, moving Right seems better to eventually reach the food at (6,4).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,4). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head at (2,4), tail at (4,4). Distance is |2-4| + |4-4| = 2. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance = 1).\nSo no danger from this rule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all considerations:\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,4) is safe and keeps future options open.\n- Moving Down (D) is safe but less optimal for reaching food.\n- Moving Up (U) leads to a dead end.\n\n**Best immediate action is to move Right (R).**\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. The head is at (3, 4), and the tail is at (5, 4).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - At (4, 6): value = 1 (positive food), life_span = 6.\n   - At (6, 4): value = 1 (positive food), life_span = 8.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position on the grid to better understand possible moves.\n\nThe snake's body is quite long, with segments at:\n- Head: (3, 4)\n- Body: (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4)\n\nThe food is at:\n- (4, 6): This is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the 10th segment from the head).\n- (6, 4): This is adjacent to the snake's head (since head is at (3,4), moving right to (4,4), then (5,4), then (6,4)).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). The possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) = (3, 5)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) = (3, 3)\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) = (2, 4)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) = (4, 4)\n\nBut we cannot move in the opposite direction of the current movement (Left is opposite of Right), so Left is invalid.\n\nSo, valid moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (3, 5)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Is (3,5) a wall? No (walls are at x=0,7 or y=0,7, and (5,2) is internal).\n     - Is (3,5) in the snake's body? Looking at the body segments: (3,5) is the 8th segment. But after moving, the tail will move forward, so the new body will exclude the current tail (5,4). So (3,5) is still part of the body (it's the 7th segment in the new body). So this would be a collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Collision with body, invalid move.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (3, 3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Is (3,3) a wall? No.\n     - Is (3,3) in the snake's body? Checking the body segments: (3,3) is not in the current body. After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new body excludes (5,4). Still, (3,3) is not in the new body.\n   - Food at (3,3)? No.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (4, 4)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Is (4,4) a wall? No.\n     - Is (4,4) in the snake's body? Current body: (4,4) is not present. After moving, tail moves, still not in body.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's think about the food:\n\n1. **Food at (4, 6)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body (at (4,6), which is the 10th segment).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away, and then the head must move onto it.\n   - Currently, the head is at (3,4), so to reach (4,6), it would take multiple moves (e.g., Right to (4,4), then Up to (4,5), then Up to (4,6)). But by then, the body may have moved.\n   - Also, the food's life_span is 6, so it will disappear at turn 75 (69 + 6).\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n2. **Food at (6, 4)**:\n   - Currently adjacent to the snake's head via the path: (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (5,4) -> (6,4).\n   - The tail is at (5,4), so moving to (6,4) would mean the head is at (6,4) and the tail moves from (5,4) to (6,4) is not possible because the tail follows the body.\n   - Wait, let's think carefully:\n     - Current head: (3,4), direction R.\n     - Move R to (4,4): tail was at (5,4), now moves to (4,4)? Wait, no, the tail is the last segment, so the new tail would be the second last segment after the move, which is (6,4) becomes the new tail?\n     - Actually, the snake's body is a list where each segment follows the previous one. After moving right to (4,4), the new body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), ..., (6,4)], so the tail is now (6,4).\n     - Then next move could be R to (5,4), but (5,4) is the old tail, which is now part of the body (since the tail moved to (6,4)). So moving to (5,4) would collide with the body.\n     - Alternatively, after first R to (4,4), then U to (4,5), etc.\n   - It seems the path to (6,4) is not straightforward without risking collision.\n   - Also, the food at (6,4) is adjacent to the tail (5,4), and eating it would make the head go to (6,4) and the tail grow to (6,4), causing a collision in the next move (since the head would be at (6,4) and the new tail at (6,4) is the same position).\n   - This is the \"Tail Reward Danger\" mentioned in the rules: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n   - Here, the tail is at (5,4), and the food is at (6,4), which is adjacent (right of the tail). If we move towards (6,4), we'd be eating the food when the head is adjacent to the tail, which is dangerous.\n   - **Conclusion**: Moving towards (6,4) is risky due to Tail Reward Danger.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven the above:\n- Move U: leads to collision.\n- Move D: safe, no food.\n- Move R: safe, no food, but moving towards food at (6,4) is risky.\n\nBetween D and R, both are safe with no immediate food. Moving R continues the current direction, which might be preferable unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nHowever, moving R could eventually lead towards the food at (6,4), which is risky. Moving D is safer as it avoids that path.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\nAre there any other foods or paths to consider?\n- The other food at (4,6) is under the body and not immediately accessible.\n- No other foods are present.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Down (D) is safe and doesn't lead towards any immediate danger.\n- Moving Right (R) is safe now but could lead to danger when approaching the food at (6,4).\n- Moving Up (U) is unsafe.\n\nThe safest immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(4, 6): Value = 5, Life Span = 1\n2. (6, 4): Value = 7, Life Span = 1\n3. (1, 2): Value = 10, Life Span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) (as per the \"No instant reverse\" rule). So, possible immediate moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Continue Down (D):\n- Current head: (3, 3)\n- Next position: (3, 2) (since D is (x, y-1))\n  \n**Check for collisions:**\n- **Walls**: y=2 is not a border wall (borders are y=0 and y=7). No internal wall at (3,2).\n- **Body**: Check if (3,2) is in the snake's body positions. Current body segments are from (3,4) to (6,4). (3,2) is not in this list.\n  \n**Food Check**: Is there food at (3,2)? Looking at the food positions: (4,6), (6,4), (1,2). No food at (3,2).\n\n**Conclusion**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n- Current head: (3, 3)\n- Next position: (2, 3) (L is (x-1, y))\n  \n**Check for collisions:**\n- **Walls**: x=2 is not a border wall (borders are x=0 and x=7). No internal wall at (2,3).\n- **Body**: Is (2,3) in the snake's body? Checking the list: No.\n\n**Food Check**: Food at (1,2), (4,6), (6,4). No food at (2,3).\n\n**Conclusion**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n- Current head: (3, 3)\n- Next position: (4, 3) (R is (x+1, y))\n  \n**Check for collisions:**\n- **Walls**: x=4 is not a border wall. No internal wall at (4,3).\n- **Body**: Is (4,3) in the snake's body? Checking the list: No.\n\n**Food Check**: No food at (4,3).\n\n**Conclusion**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we can consider moving towards in future turns, even if not immediately.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (3,3):\n- Up (U): (3,4) - Occupied by body (first segment after head)\n- Down (D): (3,2) - Empty\n- Left (L): (2,3) - Empty\n- Right (R): (4,3) - Empty\n\nNo food is adjacent to the head right now. The closest foods are:\n1. (4,6): Distance from (3,3) is |4-3| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. (6,4): Distance is |6-3| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n3. (1,2): Distance is |1-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThe closest is (1,2) with distance 3. However, all foods have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. So, none of the foods can be eaten in the next move because they're not adjacent, and by the next turn, they'll be gone.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail position: (6,4)\nIs head adjacent to tail? Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right), not diagonal.\nHead: (3,3), Tail: (6,4)\nDistance: |6-3| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\nNot adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n\nSo, no danger from this rule in the current state.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven that:\n- All foods will disappear after this turn (life span = 1), and none are adjacent to the head to be eaten immediately.\n- All possible moves (D, L, R) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body.\n- No immediate food to eat, so the goal is to position the snake for future opportunities.\n\nSince all moves are equally safe in terms of immediate rewards and risks, we can choose any. However, it's often good to avoid moving towards areas where the snake's body is dense to prevent trapping itself in the future.\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Moving Down (D) to (3,2): The area below is relatively open.\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,3): The left side has some body segments but not immediately constricting.\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,3): The right side leads towards the center where there's more space.\n\nGiven that moving Right seems to head towards a more open area, it might be the better choice to avoid future traps.\n\n### Verifying Future Moves After Right (R)\n\nIf we move Right to (4,3), next possible moves (from direction R):\n- Cannot move Left (opposite of R)\n- Possible: U, D, R\n\nFuture food may spawn, and being in the center provides more options.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all immediate moves are safe and no food can be eaten this turn, choosing a move that keeps the snake in a more open area is preferable. Moving Right seems optimal here.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Internal obstacles are at (5,2), not (4,2) → safe.\n   - **Food Check**:\n     - No food at (4, 2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5, 3)**:\n   - **Collision Check**:\n     - Is (5, 3) a wall? x=7 is a wall, but x=5 is not.\n     - Is (5, 3) part of the snake's body?

However, we should consider paths that might lead to food soon.\n\n- **Food at (4, 6)**:\n  - Currently under the snake's body (part of the snake at (4,6)).\n  - To eat this, the body must move away, and the head must move onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is at (4,3). Moving up to (4,4) doesn't immediately help, but could be part of a path to reach (4,6) later.\n\n- **Food at (6, 4)**:\n  - Not under the snake. To reach it, the snake could move right to (5,3), then up to (5,4), then right to (6,4).\n  - But moving right now doesn't immediately help unless we plan a path.\n\n- **Food at (1, 2)**:\n  - Far from the current head position; not immediately reachable.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe must also check if moving to a cell adjacent to the tail could lead to a situation where eating positive food causes the head to collide with the newly grown tail.\n\nLooking at the tail:\n- Tail is at (6,5).\n- Adjacent to tail: (5,5), (6,4), (7,5), (6,6). But (7,5) is a wall, (6,6) is y=7 (wall).\n- Currently, head is at (4,3), not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll immediate moves are safe but don't lead directly to food.

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 72  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (5, 3), followed by:\n- (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5)\n\nSo, the snake's body is quite long, wrapping around the grid.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (4, 6): value = 1, life_span = 3\n2. (6, 4): value = 1, life_span = 5\n3. (1, 2): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 reward, +1 length).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 3) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3)\n\nBut we cannot reverse direction immediately. Current direction is R, so we cannot move Left (L) next.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5, 4)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,4) is within bounds (x=5 is between 0-7, y=4 is between 0-7).\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not (5,4), so safe.\n     - Body collision: Check if (5,4) is in snake's body.\n       - Snake body segments: (4,3), (3,3), ..., (5,5). (5,4) is not in the list.\n   - Safe to move.\n   - Food at (5,4)? No food listed there.\n   - No immediate reward, but safe.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (5, 2)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,2) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is an obstacle! So cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move due to obstacle.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (6,3) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: Not (6,3).\n     - Body collision: Is (6,3) in snake's body? No.\n   - Safe to move.\n   - Food at (6,3)? No, food is at (6,4), (4,6), (1,2).\n   - No immediate reward, but safe.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: U or R.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head (5,3) that we can aim for next turn.\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,3):\n- Up (5,4)\n- Down (5,2) - obstacle\n- Left (4,3) - body segment\n- Right (6,3)\n\nNo food is adjacent right now. But let's see where food is:\n\n1. (4,6): distance from (5,3) is |5-4| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. (6,4): |5-6| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n3. (1,2): |5-1| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nClosest is (6,4) at distance 2. To reach (6,4) from (5,3):\n\nCurrent head at (5,3). To reach (6,4), possible path:\n- Move Right to (6,3), then Up to (6,4).\n   - Next turn after R would be U to (6,4).\n   - Check if (6,4) is safe next turn:\n     - Not a wall, not an obstacle.\n     - Is it in snake's body? Current body: after moving R to (6,3), tail moves forward, so body is [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ..., (5,5)] minus the last segment (since length increases only when eating, but we're not eating now).\n     - (6,4) is not in the current body, and after tail moves, it's still not there unless the tail was at (6,4), which it's not.\n     - Also, no tail reward danger here since we're not eating from adjacent to tail.\n\nAlternatively:\n- Move Up to (5,4), then Right to (6,4).\n   - Next turn after U would be R to (6,4).\n   - Similar safety check: (6,4) not in body after this move.\n\nBoth paths are valid to reach (6,4) in two moves. \n\nBut which first move is better?\n\nOption 1: R then U\n- First R to (6,3), then U to (6,4).\n   - After R to (6,3), next turn can go U to (6,4).\n   - Then can eat (6,4) if it's still there (life_span=5, current turn=72, so disappears at turn=72+5=77, so will be there unless eaten by someone else, but it's single player).\n\nOption 2: U then R\n- First U to (5,4), then R to (6,4).\n   - After U to (5,4), next turn can go R to (6,4).\n\nBoth are equivalent in steps, but let's see if one is safer or more flexible.\n\nAfter R to (6,3), next possible moves would be U to (6,4) or R to (7,3) which is a wall, or D to (6,2) which is safe.\nAfter U to (5,4), next possible moves would be R to (6,4), or U to (5,5) which is body segment (current tail is at (5,5)), or L to (4,4) which is safe.\n\nHmm, moving R first seems slightly better because after (6,3), we have more options (U or D) if we decide not to go for food next turn, whereas after U to (5,4), L is safe but U is into body.\n\nAlso, moving R first gets us closer to the right side where (6,4) is.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n\nTail is at (5,5). Is there food at (5,5)? No, food is at (4,6), (6,4), (1,2).\n\nNo danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and R, both are safe, but R seems slightly better for reaching (6,4) next turn.\n\nMoving R to (6,3) now, then next turn can go U to (6,4) to eat the food there.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that we can eat by moving away?\n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (4,6): is under body segment (4,6), which is part of the snake.\n   - To eat this, head must move onto (4,6) after body moves away.\n   - Current head is at (5,3), to reach (4,6) would take multiple moves, not immediate.\n- Others are not under body.\n\nSo no immediate food to eat by moving away.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Right (R) to (6,3), setting up to eat (6,4) next turn if possible.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Not a wall.\n  - Check if it's a body segment: \n    - Snake body: (5,3), (4,3), ..., (5,6). (6,4) is not in the body.\n  - Check for food: \n    - (6,4) is one of the food positions with value=4, life_span=1.\n    - So, eating positive food: reward +1, length increases by 1.\n    - Need to check for Tail Reward Danger: \n      - Tail is at (5,6). Adjacent cells to tail: (4,6), (6,6), (5,5), (5,7). (6,4) is not adjacent to tail, so no danger.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, can eat positive food.\n\n### Evaluating Move D: (6, 2)\n\n- **Position**: (6, 2)\n  - Check if it's a wall: x=6 is within bounds, y=2 is within bounds. Not a wall.\n  - Check for internal obstacles: (5,2) is an obstacle, but we're at (6,2), so no.\n  - Check if it's a body segment: (6,2) is not in the snake's body.\n  - Check for food: No food at (6,2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no food to eat.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Move U (6,4)**:\n  - Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1)\n  - No immediate danger\n- **Move D (6,2)**:\n  - No food, no score increase\n  - Also safe\n\nBetween these, Move U is better because it increases the score.\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to go for the food at (6,4)?\n- Life span of (6,4) is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n- Other foods:\n  - (4,6): life_span=1, but it's under the snake's body at (4,6). To eat it, we'd need to move away from (4,6) and then back, which isn't possible immediately.\n  - (1,2) and (2,5) are far away with life_span=1, likely to disappear next turn if not eaten now, but we can't reach them in one move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After U\n\nIf we go U to (6,4):\n- Next head position: (6,4)\n- Direction: U (assuming we continue up unless we change)\n- Then possible moves would be U (6,5), L (5,4), R (7,4) [invalid], D (6,3) [opposite, invalid unless we change direction]\n- (6,5): check walls - y=5 is within bounds, not a wall.\n  - Body: after moving to (6,4), tail moves forward, so new body excludes the old tail (5,6) and adds (6,4) at head.\n  - New body: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), ..., (4,6), (5,6) is gone]\n  - (6,5) is not in new body.\n  - No food at (6,5).\n- (5,4): \n  - Not a wall, not an obstacle.\n  - Not in new body.\n  - No food.\n- So next moves would be safe but no immediate food.\n\nAlternatively, after U to (6,4), could consider changing direction to left or right if needed in next moves to reach other foods, but currently, (6,4) is the only food we can eat now.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger for (4,6)\n\nJust to be thorough, the food at (4,6) is under the snake's body. To eat it:\n1. Move away from (4,6): currently (4,6) is the tail (last segment). So if we move such that the tail moves away, but the head isn't adjacent to tail's current position (5,6).\n   - Adjacent to tail (5,6): (4,6), (6,6), (5,5), (5,7)\n   - Head is at (6,3), not adjacent to (5,6), so no immediate danger.\n   - But to eat (4,6), we'd need to have head move to (4,6) after tail moves away, which isn't possible in one move from current position.\n\nSo, can't eat (4,6) now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two valid moves:\n- U (6,4): eat food, safe.\n- D (6,2): safe, no food.\n\nBest action is to go U to eat the food at (6,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

No.\n\nThis move is also safe but doesn't gain points.\n\nWait a minute, both immediate moves don't lead to food. But let's look at the food positions:\n\nFood at:\n1. (4,6): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn)\n2. (1,2): value=6, life_span=1\n3. (2,5): value=9, life_span=1\n\nThe highest value food is at (2,5) with value=9. Let's see how to reach it.\n\nFrom (6,4), to reach (2,5), it's quite a path. Maybe not immediately.\n\nAlternatively, food at (4,6) is at the current tail position (5,6)'s adjacent. But the tail is at (5,6), and food is at (4,6). \n\n**Tail Reward Danger**: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nHere, tail is at (5,6), food is at (4,6). Head is at (6,4). Is head adjacent to tail? \n\nAdjacent means one cell apart horizontally or vertically. Distance from (6,4) to (5,6):\n- x difference: 1\n- y difference: 2\nTotal distance is more than 1, so not adjacent. So no danger from tail reward here.\n\nBut can we reach (4,6)? From (6,4):\n- Left to (5,4), then Down to (5,3) (but that's part of the body), or Left to (4,4), then Down to (4,5), Left to (3,5), Down to (3,4), etc. Seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,4), Up to (6,5), then Left to (5,5), Left to (4,5), Down to (4,6) — but (4,6) is food, but we'd be moving onto it from (4,5), which is part of the body (from snake positions: (4,5) is in the body). \n\nWait, snake body includes (4,5), so can't move there. \n\nHmm, seems hard to reach (4,6) immediately.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) and (2,5) are far.\n\nGiven that, immediate moves U or L don't lead to food, and both are safe. \n\nWhich is better? \n\nAfter U to (6,5), next moves could be L to (5,5) or U to (6,6) but y=6 is wall, so only L to (5,5). \n\nAfter L to (5,4), next moves could be U to (5,5) or L to (4,4). \n\nNot sure which is better for future paths. \n\nBut since both are safe and no immediate food, maybe prioritize not getting stuck. \n\nLooking at snake body, moving Left to (5,4) might open more options later.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that could be eaten? \n\nFood positions:\n- (4,6): under body at (4,6) (yes, it's the tail's adjacent)\n- (1,2), (2,5): not under body\n\nTo eat (4,6), head needs to move onto it when body moves away. Currently, tail is at (5,6), next to (4,6). \n\nIf we move in a way that tail moves away from (4,6), then head can reach it. \n\nBut tail moves when snake moves, unless it eats food. \n\nCurrent tail is at (5,6), preceded by (4,6) is not in body, wait no:\n\nSnake positions: ..., (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). So (4,6) is second to last, tail is (5,6). \n\nIf we don't eat food, tail moves forward, so (5,6) is removed, (4,6) becomes new tail. \n\nSo (4,6) is currently occupied by body, will become tail next move if no food eaten. \n\nFood at (4,6) is under body, so to eat it, need to move body away then head onto it. \n\nBut currently head is at (6,4), not adjacent to (4,6). \n\nSo cannot eat (4,6) this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth U and L are safe moves with no immediate food. \n\nBetween U and L, moving Left to (5,4) seems slightly better as it keeps more options open for future moves towards higher value foods like (2,5).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{L}",

(4,4) is not in the body.\n   - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=4 is not a wall.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is not (4,4).\n   - So, moving Left to (4,4) is safe.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (5,4+1) = (5,5).\n   - Check (5,5):\n     - Not in body: The body has (3,5), (4,5), but not (5,5).\n     - Walls: y=5 is not a wall.\n     - Obstacle: (5,2) is not (5,5).\n   - Safe.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (5,4-1) = (5,3).\n   - Check (5,3):\n     - Body: (6,3), (5,3), etc. Yes, (5,3) is the 4th segment.\n     - Moving into body is deadly unless it's the tail, which will move away.\n     - Tail is at (4,6), so (5,3) is not the tail. Hence, collision with body.\n   - Not safe.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Left (L) to (4,4) or Up (U) to (5,5).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **Food at (1,2)**:\n   - Value: +6, life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n   - Distance from head (5,4):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-1| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n     - Cannot reach in one move.\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n2. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - Value: +8, life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n   - Distance from head (5,4):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-2| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n     - Cannot reach in one move.\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\nNo food is directly reachable in the next move. So, the goal is to move towards food while avoiding risks.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n\n- Tail is at (4,6).\n- Food positions: (1,2) and (2,5). Neither is at (4,6).\n- So, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that:\n1. Is safe (no collision with body or walls).\n2. Moves towards the most valuable food, considering it will disappear next turn.\n\nPossible moves: Left to (4,4) or Up to (5,5).\n\nLet's see which move gets us closer to the higher-value food at (2,5):\n\n- Current head: (5,4).\n- Food at (2,5):\n  - Need to decrease x (move left) and increase y (move up).\n  \nFrom (5,4):\n- Left to (4,4):\n  - Distance to (2,5): |4-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Up to (5,5):\n  - Distance to (2,5): |5-2| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nBoth moves reduce the Manhattan distance equally. However, moving Up to (5,5) aligns the y-coordinate with the food at (2,5), which might be better for future moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving Left to (4,4) reduces the x-distance, which is also good.\n\nAnother consideration is the snake's body. Moving Left to (4,4) might be better because the snake's body is more towards the left side, and moving left could help in coiling.\n\nBut since both moves are equally good in terms of distance, and both are safe, either is acceptable. \n\nHowever, moving Up to (5,5) might open more options next turn, as from (5,5) we can move Left to (4,5) or Right to (6,5), etc.\n\n### Checking Future Moves After Each Option\n\n1. **Move Left to (4,4)**:\n   - Next head: (4,4), direction Left.\n   - Possible next moves: Left (to (3,4)), Up (to (4,5)), Down (to (4,3)).\n     - (3,4): part of body (from current state's snake positions).\n     - (4,5): part of body.\n     - (4,3): part of body.\n   - Only Left to (3,4) is possible, but it's part of the body (from current state, (3,4) is the 7th segment).\n   - Wait, the tail is at (4,6), so after moving left to (4,4), the tail moves from (4,6) to (?,?), but the body is long, so (3,4) is still part of the body.\n   - Actually, the snake's body after moving left:\n     - New head: (4,4).\n     - Remove tail (4,6), add head (4,4).\n     - New body: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (3,6)].\n     - (3,4) is part of the body (from current state's (2,4), but after moving, the body shifts.\n     - Need to reconstruct the body after move:\n       - Original body: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (4,6)].\n       - Move left: head to (4,4), remove tail (4,6).\n       - New body: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (3,6)].\n       - Next move left to (3,4):\n         - (3,4) is not in new body (original (2,4) is now (1,4), etc., but (3,4) is not in new body.\n         - Wait, original (3,4) is the 7th segment, after moving left, it's shifted.\n         - It's complex; perhaps better to assume moving left now may limit options next turn.\n\n2. **Move Up to (5,5)**:\n   - Next head: (5,5), direction Up.\n   - Possible next moves: Left (to (4,5)), Right (to (6,5)), Up (to (5,6)).\n     - (4,5): part of body (from current state's (4,5)).\n     - (6,5): not in body, not a wall.\n     - (5,6): not in body, but y=6 is not a wall, but (5,6) is not in body.\n     - From current body, after moving up:\n       - New head: (5,5).\n       - Remove tail (4,6), add head (5,5).\n       - New body: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ..., (4,6)].\n       - (4\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

But let's check all possible moves considering the current direction is left (no instant reverse, so we can't go right immediately).\n\nPossible moves:\n- **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n- **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n- **Right (R)**: Not allowed (opposite of current direction L)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,5)\n- Current tail is at (4,5), but the tail will move forward when the head moves, so the tail won't be there next turn.\n- Check if (4,5) is occupied by any other body part: \n  - The body segments are from (5,4) to (4,5). (4,5) is the tail, so it's safe because the tail moves away.\n- Is there food at (4,5)? No.\n- Any walls? No, (4,5) is within bounds.\n- **Safety**: Safe, no collision.\n- **Reward**: No immediate food, but might position for future moves.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (4,3)\n- (4,3) is part of the snake's body (6th segment from head).\n- Moving here would collide with the body.\n- **Safety**: Deadly collision.\n- **Action**: Avoid.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L) to (3,4)\n- (3,4) is part of the snake's body (8th segment from head).\n- Moving here would collide with the body.\n- **Safety**: Deadly collision.\n- **Action**: Avoid.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R) to (5,4)\n- Not allowed because current direction is left, and right is the opposite direction.\n- **Action**: Invalid.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only safe move is **Up (U)** to (4,5). \n\nBut let's check if there's any food that can be reached or if moving up leads to any immediate benefits or dangers in the next steps.\n\n#### Checking Food Items:\n\n1. **(1,2)**: value=5, life_span=1\n   - At (1,2), which is far from the head (4,4). Not reachable immediately.\n   \n2. **(2,5)**: value=7, life_span=1\n   - At (2,5). From (4,4), to reach (2,5):\n     - Path could be: (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5).\n     - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn (Turn 77). Can't reach in one move.\n   \n3. **(1,4)**: value=10, life_span=1\n   - Currently under the snake's body at segment (1,4).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (1,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, (1,4) is the 10th segment. The snake is long (16 segments), so moving the tail away would take many moves.\n     - Life_span is 1, so it disappears next turn. Can't eat it in time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n- Head is at (4,4), tail is at (4,5). They are adjacent (up from head is tail).\n- Is there food at the tail (4,5)? No.\n- So no danger from this rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is **Up (U)** to (4,5).

The head is at (4, 5), and the tail is at (3, 5).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning its last move was in the positive y-direction.\n\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - There are three food items on the grid:\n     1. (1, 2): value = 4, life_span = 1\n     2. (2, 5): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     3. (1, 4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction immediately (i.e., cannot go Down after moving Up). Since the last move was Up, the possible next moves are Up, Left, or Right.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4, 6)\n   - **New Head Position**: (4, 6)\n   - **Check for Collisions**:\n     - **Walls**: y=7 is a wall, so (4,6) is safe (not a wall).\n     - **Body**: Check if (4,6) is in the snake's body. Current body positions are from (4,5) to (3,5). (4,6) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n   - **Food Check**: Is there food at (4,6)? The food positions are (1,2), (2,5), (1,4). No food at (4,6), so no score change.\n   - **Safety**: Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3, 5)\n   - **New Head Position**: (3, 5)\n   - **Check for Collisions**:\n     - **Walls**: x=0 is a wall, but (3,5) is not a wall.\n     - **Body**: The tail is at (3,5). Moving into the tail is generally safe because the tail will move forward in the next turn, but we need to check if there's positive food at the tail that could cause a collision after growth.\n     - **Tail Reward Danger**: Is there positive food at the tail (3,5)? Checking food positions: (1,2), (2,5), (1,4). No food at (3,5), so no danger.\n   - **Food Check**: No food at (3,5), so no score change.\n   - **Safety**: Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5, 5)\n   - **New Head Position**: (5, 5)\n   - **Check for Collisions**:\n     - **Walls**: x=7 is a wall, but (5,5) is safe.\n     - **Body**: Is (5,5) in the snake's body? Current body positions: (4,5) to (3,5). (5,5) is not in this list.\n   - **Food Check**: Is there food at (5,5)? No, food is at (1,2), (2,5), (1,4).\n   - **Safety**: Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. However, the food items are:\n\n1. (1, 2): value = 4, life_span = 1 (will disappear next turn)\n2. (2, 5): value = 6, life_span = 1 (will disappear next turn)\n3. (1, 4): value = 9, life_span = 1 (will disappear next turn)\n\nGiven that all food will disappear after this turn, we cannot reach any of them in this move because they are not adjacent to the current head position (4,5). \n\nAdjacent positions to (4,5):\n- Up: (4,6)\n- Down: (4,4) - but cannot go Down (reverse move)\n- Left: (3,5)\n- Right: (5,5)\n\nNone of these adjacent positions have food.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince we cannot reach food this turn, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it to reach food in future turns. \n\nLooking at the current position and possible moves:\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,6) is safe but doesn't help in reaching food.\n- Moving Left (L) to (3,5) is safe and moves towards the left side where some food is ((1,2), (1,4)), but both will disappear next turn.\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,5) is safe but doesn't immediately help in reaching food.\n\nGiven that all food will disappear next turn, our priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive. \n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in the next moves? \n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- The body is long, and the head is at (4,5). The next segment is (4,4), then (5,4), etc.\n- Moving Up to (4,6) is safe as no body is there.\n- Moving Left to (3,5) is the tail, which is safe as the tail will move.\n- Moving Right to (5,5) is safe.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince all moves are safe and no food is reachable this turn, we can choose any safe move. Moving Left (L) might be slightly better as it moves the snake towards the left side where there was food (though it's disappearing), potentially opening up space for new food to spawn in future turns.\n\nHowever, since all moves are equally safe and none lead to food, the choice is arbitrary. \n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Since the last move was Left (L), cannot go Right (R) next.\n- Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L).\n\n**Current Head Position:** (3,5)\n- U: (3,5) → (3,6)\n- D: (3,5) → (3,4)\n- L: (3,5) → (2,5)\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U): (3,5) → (3,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Next position: (3,6)\n  - Snake body segments: Looking at the list, (3,6) is the tail (last segment).\n    - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n      - If the tail cell has positive food, and we eat it, the snake grows, and the new tail would be where the old tail was, causing a collision.\n      - Current tail is at (3,6). Is there food at (3,6)? No, food is at (1,2), (2,5), (1,4).\n      - So no Tail Reward Danger here.\n  - Walls: (3,6) is within borders (x=3, y=6; y=7 is wall, so y=6 is okay).\n  - Obstacles: (5,2) is not (3,6).\n- Food at (3,6)? No.\n- Conclusion: Safe to move Up.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D): (3,5) → (3,4)\n- Next position: (3,4)\n- Check body segments: (3,4) is in the body at position 10 in the list (counting from 0: head is 0, then 1, etc.).\n  - Specifically, the segments are: \n    - (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), ...\n    - (3,4) is the 10th segment (index 9).\n  - So moving to (3,4) would collide with the body.\n- Conclusion: Cannot move Down — collision with body.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L): (3,5) → (2,5)\n- Next position: (2,5)\n- Check body segments: (2,5) is not in the current body positions.\n- Walls: within borders.\n- Obstacles: (5,2) is not (2,5).\n- Food at (2,5)? Yes, food at (2,5) with value=5, life_span=1.\n  - Eating this would give +5 score and increase length by 1.\n  - Need to check Tail Reward Danger:\n    - Adjacent to tail: tail is at (3,6). Adjacent means adjacent cells: (2,6), (4,6), (3,5), (3,7) — but (3,7) is out.\n    - (2,5) is not adjacent to (3,6) — distance is sqrt((2-3)^2 + (5-6)^2) = sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41, which is more than 1 (adjacent is distance 1).\n    - So no Tail Reward Danger.\n- Conclusion: Safe to move Left and eat the food at (2,5).\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Move Up (U):** Safe, no food, just moving.\n- **Move Left (L):** Safe, can eat high-value food (+5).\n\nMove Down is invalid due to collision.\n\nBetween U and L, moving Left to eat the food is more beneficial since it gives a higher score (+5) compared to not eating anything by moving Up.\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\n- **Food at (1,4):** value=8, but it's at (1,4), which is already part of the snake's body (position 11 in the list). \n  - To eat this, the body would need to move away first, then head can move onto it. Not possible in one move.\n- **Food at (1,2):** value=3, but moving towards it isn't direct from (3,5). Would require multiple moves.\n\nSo, the immediate best move is Left to eat the +5 food at (2,5).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Move Left\n\nAfter moving Left to (2,5):\n- New head: (2,5)\n- New body: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), ..., (3,6)]\n- Tail was at (3,6), now moves forward (since the snake grows by 1, the tail doesn't move, but the segment before the tail becomes the new tail).\nWait, let's clarify snake growth:\n- Normally, when you eat food, the snake grows by 1, meaning the tail doesn't move that turn.\n- So after moving to (2,5) and eating, the new snake would be:\n  - Head: (2,5)\n  - Body: (3,5), (4,5), ..., (3,6) (same as before, but tail stays at (3,6)).\n- Next turn, the tail would move forward (unless we eat again).\n\nNo immediate collision next turn from this move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to eat the high-value food at (2,5).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Up (U) to (2,6):**\n- Check (2,6):\n  - Snake body: (2,6) is the 15th segment.\n  - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but let's see:\n    - Current tail is at (3,6). After moving head to (2,6), the tail would move from (3,6) to... let's see the snake's movement:\n      - Original snake: [(2,5), (3,5), ..., (3,6)]\n      - After moving head to (2,6), new snake: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,6)]? Wait, no, the tail is the last segment, which is (3,6). After moving, the tail (3,6) is removed, and the new tail is the second last segment, which is (1,6).\n      - So (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake's body, but it's the tail's position. Moving into the tail is generally safe unless there's a special rule.\n  - However, there's a \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n    - Is (2,6) the tail? No, the tail is (3,6). Adjacent to tail would be cells next to (3,6): (2,6), (4,6), (3,5), (3,7) - but (3,7) is out of bounds.\n    - Current head is at (2,5), adjacent to tail at (3,6)? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,5) and (3,6) are diagonally adjacent, not directly adjacent (they don't share a side). So no adjacency here.\n  - Also, is there food at (2,6)? No, food is at (1,2), (1,4), (4,3).\n- Check walls: (2,6) is within bounds (x=2, y=6), not a wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe to move Up to (2,6).\n\n**3. Move Down (D) to (2,4):**\n- Check (2,4):\n  - Snake body: (2,4) is the 11th segment.\n  - Similar to above, is it the tail? No, tail is (3,6).\n  - Adjacent to tail? (2,4) is not adjacent to (3,6).\n  - Food at (2,4)? No.\n  - Walls: within bounds.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe to move Down to (2,4).\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up or Down can lead us to food.\n\n**Food at (1,2) - value 2, life_span 1:**\n- Current turn is 79, life_span is 1, so it disappears after this turn (next turn it's gone).\n- To eat it, we'd need to move to (1,2) next turn, but currently at (2,5), moving to (2,6) or (2,4) doesn't get us closer to (1,2) directly.\n- Not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n**Food at (1,4) - value 7, life_span 1:**\n- Also disappears next turn.\n- Currently at (2,5), moving to (2,4) is closer to (1,4):\n  - From (2,4), next move could be Left to (1,4) to eat it.\n  - But life_span is 1, so after this turn (turn 79), it's gone. So we can't eat it next turn; it's too late.\n- So this food is not eatable now.\n\n**Food at (4,3) - value 10, life_span 1:**\n- Disappears next turn.\n- Currently at (2,5), moving to (2,4) or (2,6):\n  - From (2,4), path to (4,3): would take multiple moves, can't reach in one move.\n  - From (2,6), even further.\n- Not immediately reachable.\n\nSo none of the food can be eaten this turn directly. The only options are safe moves that don't lead to immediate food.\n\n### Choosing Between Up and Down\n\nBoth Up to (2,6) and Down to (2,4) are safe. Let's see which is better for future moves.\n\n**Move Up to (2,6):**\n- Next head position: (2,6)\n- Current direction is Left, but moving Up changes direction to Up.\n- Next possible moves from (2,6):\n  - Left (L): (1,6) - check if safe:\n    - (1,6) is in snake body (original snake has (1,6) as the 14th segment).\n    - But after moving head to (2,6), the tail moves from (3,6) to (1,6)? Wait, no:\n      - Original snake: [(2,5), (3,5), ..., (3,6)]\n      - After moving to (2,6): [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (1,6)]? Not sure, but (1,6) is part of the body, so likely unsafe.\n  - Up (U): (2,7) - y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  - Right (R): (3,6) - original tail is at (3,6), which moves away, so (3,6) is safe unless it's the new tail.\n    - After move, tail is (1,6), so (3,6) is now empty.\n    - So Right is safe.\n  - Cannot move Down (opposite of Up).\n- So next turn from (2,6), can move Right to (3,6).\n\n**Move Down to (2,4):**\n- Next head position: (2,4)\n- Direction changes to Down.\n- Next possible moves from (2,4):\n  - Left (L): (1,4) - check:\n    - (1,4) is in snake body (original snake has (1,4) as 12th segment).\n    - After moving to (2,4), tail moves from (3,6) to (1,4)? Not sure, but likely (1,4) is still in body, so unsafe.\n \n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
