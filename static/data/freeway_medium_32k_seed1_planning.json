        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1 (which is 0 here), with head and tail, and speed. The car spans are given for time t_1, and I need to find where they are at future times to avoid being on the same freeway when the car covers position x=0.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and at that same turn T, for some car on that freeway, x=0 is within the car's span. Importantly, when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only need to worry about the freeway I'm on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe game dynamics say: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut I think this is about when I move, I change position at the end of the turn, so during the turn, I'm still on the original row. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at time t, position is (0, y_t), and after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen for collision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note clarifies that if I move to a different row at turn T, I'm still on y_T for that turn, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at each turn T, I am on row y_T, and I check if there is a car on that row at time T where x=0 is covered.\n\nThen I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, the car spans move over time. For left-moving, span becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)], and for right-moving, [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the span notation, for left-moving, head and tail are given, and it moves left, so h decreases. Similarly for right, head increases if it's the front.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, each with their own head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nI need to simulate the car positions over time to see when they cover x=0 on each row.\n\nt_1 = 0, so for time T, the car span at T is based on t_1=0.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSince direction is right, and span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, the head should be on the right, so h should be larger than τ? -48 and -83, -48 > -83, so head at -48, tail at -83, so it's moving right, so span at time t: [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48, -83, right, 36) → span at t: [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\nFreeway 3: same, [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) → head -48, tail -71, since -48 > -71, so right-moving, span: [-71 + 24t, -48 + 24t]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, [-71 + 24t, -48 + 24t]\n\nFreeway 6: same, [-71 + 24t, -48 + 24t]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37, 48>37, so span: [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\nSecond car: head 12, tail 1, 12>1, span: [1 + 4t, 12 + 4t]\n\nThird car: head -24, tail -35, -24 > -35, span: [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4) so same spans.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at some turn T, I am on row k, and for that row, at time T, 0 is in one of the car spans on that row.\n\nFor example, on row 1, at time T, if 0 ∈ [-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T] or similar for other rows.\n\nSince freeways 1,2,3 have the same car, and 4,5,6 have the same, and 7 and 8 are the same.\n\nBut I need to find for each row, when x=0 is covered by a car at time T.\n\nx=0 is covered if for a span [L, U], L <= 0 <= U.\n\nSo for each row, I need to find times T where this happens.\n\nFirst, row 1: car span [-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T]\n\n0 in this interval when -83 + 36T <= 0 <= -48 + 36T\n\nSolve:\n\n-83 + 36T <= 0 => 36T <= 83 => T <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T <= 2 since T integer? T is turn, so integer.\n\nT starts from t_1=0, and increases by integer turns.\n\nSo for row 1: -83 + 36T <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36T\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36T <= 0 => 36T <= 83 => T <= 83/36 = 2.305, so T <= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36T => 48 <= 36T => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so T >= 2 since T integer.\n\nT >= ceil(1.333) = 2, and T <= floor(2.305) = 2, so T=2.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt T=1: -83 + 36*1 = -47, -48 + 36*1 = -12, so [-47, -12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=2: -83 + 72 = -11, -48 + 72 = 24, so [-11, 24], 0 is between -11 and 24? -11 <= 0 <= 24, yes, 0 is in.\n\nAt T=3: -83 + 108 = 25, -48 + 108 = 60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=2 for row 1.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 and row 3 have the same car, so same as row 1: unsafe at T=2 only.\n\nNow row 4: car span [-71 + 24T, -48 + 24T]\n\n0 in this when -71 + 24T <= 0 <= -48 + 24T\n\nFirst: -71 + 24T <= 0 => 24T <= 71 => T <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so T <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 24T => 48 <= 24T => T >= 2\n\nSo T=2.\n\nAt T=2: -71 + 48 = -23, -48 + 48 = 0, so [-23, 0], 0 <= 0, so yes, included, collision.\n\nAt T=1: -71+24= -47, -48+24= -24, [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: -71+72=1, -48+72=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo row 4 unsafe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly row 5 and 6 same, so unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow row 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4T, 48 + 4T], since [τ + s t, h + s t] = [37 +4T, 48+4T]\n\n0 in this: 37+4T <= 0 <= 48+4T\n\nBut 37+4T <=0 implies T <= -37/4 = -9.25, impossible, so never true for T>=0. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: [1 + 4T, 12 + 4T]\n\n0 in this: 1+4T <=0 <=12+4T\n\n1+4T <=0 => 4T <= -1, impossible. So never.\n\nThird car: [-35 + 4T, -24 + 4T]\n\n0 in this: -35 +4T <=0 <= -24 +4T\n\nFirst: -35+4T <=0 => 4T <=35 => T <= 35/4 = 8.75, T<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +4T => 24 <=4T => T>=6\n\nSo for T=6,7,8.\n\nCheck:\n\nT=6: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=7: -35+28= -7, -24+28=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=8: -35+32= -3, -24+32=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=5: -35+20= -15, -24+20= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nT=9: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo row 7 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 has same cars, so unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, row 0 and row 9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nI start at row 0, time 0.\n\nI need to reach row 9.\n\nSince row 0 and 9 have no cars, I can be there any time.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, with min turns.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on rows 1-8 when they are unsafe.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\n- Rows 1,2,3: unsafe at T=2 only\n\n- Rows 4,5,6: unsafe at T=2 only\n\n- Rows 7,8: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nAll other times, these rows are safe.\n\nFor rows 1-6, only T=2 is unsafe, so I can be on them at other times.\n\nRows 7 and 8 unsafe from T=6 to 8.\n\nNow, I start at time 0, row 0.\n\nI need to reach row 9.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if I go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 in 9 turns.\n\nBut I might have to wait or detour to avoid unsafe times.\n\nIn this case, with unsafe only at specific times, I might be able to go directly but avoid being on certain rows at bad times.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are only unsafe at T=2, which is early, and rows 7-8 unsafe later.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nLet me denote time starting from t=0.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nI take action a_0, then at t=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nSimilarly, at time t, I am on row y_t.\n\nCollision if at time t, I am on row k, and for that k, at time t, x=0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nNow, for k=1 to 6, unsafe only at t=2.\n\nFor k=7,8, unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nk=0 and 9 always safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as early as possible.\n\nMinimal H: since I start at y=0, after H turns, I am at y_H, and I want y_H =9.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at position after H steps.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions a_{t_1 + t}, and after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, time is H, position y_H.\n\nAnd we set y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=0, so at time H, y_H=9.\n\nNow, from y=0 to y=9, min steps: if all up, H=9, at time 9, y=9.\n\nBut I might be able to do it faster? No, because each step changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 steps, so H min 9.\n\nCan I do it in less? No, since y changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo H >=9.\n\nNow, with obstacles, it might take more if I need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps I can do it in 9.\n\nNow, at time t, I need to be on a safe row.\n\nSpecifically, if I am on row 1-6 at t=2, collision.\n\nIf on row 7 or 8 at t=6,7, or 8, collision.\n\nOtherwise, all safe.\n\nNow, let me try to go directly up.\n\nSuppose I go U every turn.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\na0=U, to y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, now is t=1 safe? For row 1, unsafe only at t=2, so at t=1, safe. So no collision.\n\na1=U, to y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, but t=2, row 2 unsafe, collision! Because row 2 unsafe at t=2.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nIf I go straight up, at t=2 I am on row 2, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on rows 1-6 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on any of 1-6 at t=2, collision.\n\nNow, at t=2, I need to be on row 0, or 7,8,9, but row 9 is target, I might not be there yet.\n\nRows 7 and 8 are safe at t=2, since unsafe only at t=6,7,8.\n\nRow 0 and 9 safe.\n\nSo at t=2, I should be on row 0,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut since I start from row 0 at t=0, and I need to go up, being on row 0 at t=2 might not help.\n\nI could delay my movement or go down temporarily.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are safe except t=2, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=1, I can be on row 1, which is safe.\n\nAt t=3, row 1 is safe, etc.\n\nThe only problem is t=2 for rows 1-6.\n\nSimilarly for rows 7-8, t=6,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 in min time, H=9, but I need to avoid t=2 on rows 1-6.\n\nAt t=2, I should not be on rows 1-6.\n\nSo possible: be on row 0,7,8,9 at t=2.\n\nSince I start at t=0 y=0, if I stay or go down, but going down to y<0 not possible, y>=0.\n\ny=0 is the bottom.\n\nSo at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter a0, at t=1, y1 = 0,1, or -1? But y must be in 0-9, so if a0=D, y1=0-1=-1, not allowed, so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=0, I cannot go down, only S or U.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, cannot go up.\n\nBut now, at t=0, y=0, I can do S or U.\n\nIf I do U, at t=1 y=1.\n\nThen at t=1, I can do U, D, or S.\n\nBut if I do U, to y=2 at t=2, but t=2 row 2 unsafe.\n\nIf I do D at t=1, from y=1 to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen from there I can go up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nI want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf I go to y=0 at t=2, then I need to go from y=0 to y=9, which takes at least 9 more turns, so total at least 11 turns? Not necessarily, because time is cumulative.\n\nAt t=0: start y=0\n\na0: suppose S, then t=1: y=0\n\na1: S, then t=2: y=0, safe.\n\nThen from t=2, y=0, I need to reach y=9.\n\nMin 9 turns, so at t=11, y=9.\n\nBut earlier, if I could go faster.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\na0=U, to t=1 y=1\n\nAt t=1, y=1, I can do D to go to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen t=2 y=0, safe.\n\nSame as above, then go up from there.\n\nStill, from t=2 y=0 to y=9 min at t=11.\n\nBut I can be on higher rows at t=2.\n\nFor example, can I be on row 7 at t=2?\n\nAt t=0 y=0, to y=7 in 2 steps? Impossible, since each step +1, in 2 steps I can reach y=2 max.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 too far.\n\nSo at t=2, possible y: since start y=0, after two actions, y can be 0,1,2.\n\n- If both S: y=0\n\n- S then U: y=1\n\n- U then S: y=1\n\n- U then U: y=2\n\n- Cannot go down from 0.\n\nSo y at t=2 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nBut y=1 or 2 at t=2 is unsafe, since rows 1-2 are part of 1-6.\n\nOnly y=0 is safe at t=2.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, at t=2, I must be on y=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nTherefore, I need to be at y=0 at time t=2.\n\nNow, from start: t=0 y=0.\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=2, I need to take actions such that I don't go up.\n\nSpecifically, at t=0, I can do S or U? If I do U, to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, if I do D, to y=0 at t=2.\n\nIf I do S at t=0, to y=0 at t=1, then at t=1, do S or U? If U, to y=1 at t=2, unsafe; if S, to y=0 at t=2.\n\nSo possibilities: either S at both t=0 and t=1, or U then D, both lead to y=0 at t=2.\n\nNow, after t=2, I am at y=0, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nMin turns: 9 up actions, but I need to avoid the later unsafe times for rows 7 and 8.\n\nRows 7 and 8 are unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, I start from t=2, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some time H.\n\nSince at t=2, I begin moving up.\n\nEach step up increases y by 1, so to reach y=9, I need 9 up actions, but I might need to wait or something if I hit unsafe times.\n\nLet me denote time from t=2 onwards.\n\nSet t' = t - 2, so at t'=0, y=0.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9 at some t' = H-2.\n\nBut absolute time t = t' + 2.\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, which is t'=4,5,6.\n\nBecause t=6 is t'=4? t' = t - 2, so t=6 is t'=4, t=7 is t'=5, t=8 is t'=6.\n\nSo rows 7 and 8 unsafe at t'=4,5,6.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t'=0 to y=9 at some t'=K.\n\nMin K=9 if all up.\n\nBut at t'=4,5,6, I should not be on row 7 or 8.\n\nNow, let's see when I would be on row 7 or 8 if I go directly up.\n\nSuppose I go U every step from t'=0.\n\nThen:\n\nt'=0: y=0\n\na: U, t'=1 y=1\n\nU, t'=2 y=2\n\nU, t'=3 y=3\n\nU, t'=4 y=4\n\nU, t'=5 y=5\n\nU, t'=6 y=6\n\nU, t'=7 y=7\n\nU, t'=8 y=8\n\nU, t'=9 y=9\n\nNow, at which t' am I on which row.\n\nAt time t', after actions, y_{t'}.\n\nAt t'=0: y=0\n\nAfter action at t'=0, y at t'=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time t' (absolute from start of this phase), position at beginning of turn.\n\nBetter to use absolute time.\n\nFrom t=2, y=0.\n\nAt time t=2, y=0.\n\nI take action a2, then at t=3, y3 = y2 + Δy2.\n\ny2=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nFor t=2, y=0.\n\nThen I need to get to y=9 at some t.\n\nNow, if I go all up:\n\nt=2: y=0\n\na2=U, t=3: y=1\n\na3=U, t=4: y=2\n\na4=U, t=5: y=3\n\na5=U, t=6: y=4\n\na6=U, t=7: y=5\n\na7=U, t=8: y=6\n\na8=U, t=9: y=7\n\na9=U, t=10: y=8\n\na10=U, t=11: y=9\n\nNow, when am I on row 7 or 8?\n\nAt time t, y_t is the row.\n\nAt t=9, y=7? Let's see:\n\nt=2: y=0\n\nt=3: y=1\n\nt=4: y=2\n\nt=5: y=3\n\nt=6: y=4\n\nt=7: y=5\n\nt=8: y=6\n\nt=9: y=7\n\nt=10: y=8\n\nt=11: y=9\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 unsafe at t=6,7,8? t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, which is row 4, not 7 or 8.\n\nt=7, y=5, row 5\n\nt=8, y=6, row 6\n\nAll not 7 or 8.\n\nThen at t=9, y=7, row 7, but t=9 is not unsafe time. Unsafe for row 7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=9 is after, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=10 y=8, row 8, t=10 not in 6,7,8, safe.\n\nt=11 y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, I am never on row 7 or 8 during t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=6, I am on y=4; t=7 y=5; t=8 y=6; all below 7.\n\nThen at t=9 y=7, which is fine since t=9>8.\n\nSimilarly, no problem with rows 1-6 because after t=2, I am on them at t=3,4,5,6,7,8, but for rows 1-6, only unsafe at t=2, which has passed, so they are safe at other times.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=3 onwards, I am on rows 1-6 at various times, but since t>2, it's safe.\n\nAnd rows 7 and 8 only at t=9 and t=10, which are safe times.\n\nSo I can reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? H is the number of actions.\n\nStart from t=0.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, and at time H, y_H=9.\n\nIn this plan: from t=0 to t=2, I need to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nFor example, I can do:\n\nt=0: a0 = S or U? If I do U at t=0, then at t=1 y=1, then a1=D, to y=0 at t=2.\n\nOr, a0=S, to y=0 at t=1, then a1=S, to y=0 at t=2.\n\nEither way, two actions to stay at y=0 for t=2.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=11, 9 up actions to go to y=9.\n\nTotal actions: 2 + 9 =11, from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions? Let's count.\n\nTime: t=0,1,2,...,10, that's 11 time points, but actions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at time t=11, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, time H.\n\nMinimal H=9, but here H=11.\n\nBut I might be able to do better.\n\nAfter t=2, I am at y=0, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nIn the direct up, I reached at t=11.\n\nBut since rows 1-6 are safe after t=2, and rows 7-8 safe except t=6,7,8, I could go faster by not delaying, but I have to be at y=0 at t=2, so I lost 2 turns already.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a higher row earlier, but at t=2, I must be on y=0, so I can't be higher.\n\nUnless I can reach row 7 or 8 at t=2, but impossible in 2 steps from y=0.\n\nMax y=2 at t=2, which is unsafe.\n\nSo no, I have to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThus, minimal time to reach y=9 is at t=11, with 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the row 7-8 unsafe times by going slower or faster.\n\nIn the above sequence, with all up after t=2, I pass row 7 at t=9 and row 8 at t=10, both safe.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can't, since min steps.\n\nIf I go slower, it would take more time.\n\nBut I need to make sure that when I am on row 7 or 8, it is not at t=6,7,8.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on row 7 at t=9>8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=10>8, safe.\n\nNow, what about row 7 at earlier times? For example, if I were on row 7 at t=5, but in direct, I am on row 7 at t=9.\n\nBut t=5 is safe for row 7, since unsafe only 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut I need to output the action sequence.\n\nFirst, for the beginning: to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nI can choose different actions.\n\nFor example, option 1: at t=0, do S; at t=1, do S.\n\nThen t=2, y=0.\n\nOption 2: at t=0, do U; at t=1, do D; then t=2, y=0.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nNow, from t=2, all U to t=11.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nt=0: a0 = S (if I choose stay)\n\nThen t=1: a1 = S\n\nt=2: y=0\n\nThen a2=U, t=3 y=1\n\na3=U, t=4 y=2\n\na4=U, t=5 y=3\n\na5=U, t=6 y=4\n\na6=U, t=7 y=5\n\na7=U, t=8 y=6\n\na8=U, t=9 y=7\n\na9=U, t=10 y=8\n\na10=U, t=11 y=9\n\nSo actions: t=0: S, t=1: S, t=2: U, t=3: U, t=4: U, t=5: U, t=6: U, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U\n\nThat's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nWith U then D: t=0: U, t=1: D, then t=2 y=0, same as above.\n\nBut with U then D, at t=1 I was at y=1, which is safe since t=1 not 2.\n\nThen back to 0.\n\nBut in terms of actions, similar.\n\nNow, but I need to reach in minimal H, is 11 minimal?\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier but avoid t=2 on low rows.\n\nBut at t=2, I must not be on 1-6, so only y=0 possible.\n\nUnless I can be on row 9 at t=2, impossible.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut what about row 7 or 8 at t=2? Impossible to reach.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let me check if I can reach faster by going during safe times.\n\nFor example, after t=2, I go up, but I could go slower to avoid rows 7-8 at bad times, but in this case, I don't need to, since I pass them after t=8.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go down from higher, but I start from low.\n\nSince rows 7-8 are unsafe at t=6,7,8, I should not be on them at those times.\n\nIn the direct path, I am on row 4 at t=6, row 5 at t=7, row 6 at t=8, all below 7, so fine.\n\nIf I were faster, I can't be.\n\nSuppose I want to be on row 7 at t=5 or t=9, etc.\n\nBut in min time, I arrive at row 7 at t=9.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some point to delay.\n\nFor example, if I stay at row 6 for a while, but then I arrive later, which is worse.\n\nSo min H is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on row 7 and 8.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=6, I am on row 4; t=7 row 5; t=8 row 6; all safe.\n\nAt t=9 row 7, safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=0, so actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=11, actions at t=0 to 10.\n\nNow, for the beginning, I can choose how to stay at y=0 at t=2.\n\nPerhaps using S,S is fine, or U,D.\n\nI think S,S is simpler, no moving.\n\nIn U,D, I go up and down, but same effect.\n\nNow, but let me make sure about row 7 and 8 cars.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars, and at t=6,7,8, unsafe.\n\nIn my sequence, no issue.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=10?\n\nSuppose I can reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nThen I need to be at y=9 at time t=10.\n\nSince I start at t=0 y=0, to reach y=9 at t=10, I need net +9 in y over 10 steps.\n\nEach step +1,0,-1, but y cannot go below 0.\n\nMin steps to +9 is 9, so with 10 steps, I must have one stay or down, but down from 0 not possible, so I must have one stay action, and 9 up.\n\nFor example, stay once, up 9 times.\n\nNow, at which time I stay.\n\nBut I need to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nSo from t=0 to t=2, I must have actions that keep y=0 at t=2.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=10, 8 steps to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut min 9 steps, impossible in 8 steps.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=2 to y=9 at t=10, that's 8 actions (t=2 to t=9 actions, determine y at t=3 to t=10).\n\nAt time t=2, y=0.\n\nAfter action at t=2, y at t=3, ..., after action at t=9, y at t=10.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=9, that's 8 actions.\n\nWith 8 actions, from y=0, to y=9.\n\nBut each action changes y by at most 1, so max y increase 8, to y=8, cannot reach y=9 in 8 actions from y=0.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, with actions from t=2 to t=8? Let's see.\n\nTo have y at time t=10 be 9.\n\ny_{10} is set after actions up to a9.\n\nActions: a2 to a9 for y at t=3 to t=10? No.\n\nAt time t, before action, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at time t=2, y_2=0.\n\nAfter a2, y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\n...\nAfter a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\ny10 depends on y9 and a9.\n\nBut y9 depends on previous, etc.\n\nFrom y2=0, after 8 actions (a2 to a9), we have y10.\n\nThe number of actions from t=2 to t=9 is 8 actions, resulting in y3 to y10.\n\ny10 = y2 + sum_{k=2 to 9} Δy_k\n\ny2=0, so y10 = sum_{k=2 to9} Δy_k\n\nΔy_k = -1,0,1, but since y cannot be negative, and we start from 0, and go up, likely no down, but possible.\n\ny10 <= y2 + 8 *1 = 8, so y10 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 before t=11.\n\nAt t=11, y11=9, with 11 actions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nH=11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nIn the beginning, I can use two S, or U and D.\n\nPerhaps U and D is fine, but S and S is also fine.\n\nI think I'll use S and S for simplicity.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nThen Turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter a10, at t=11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nBut let me list:\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, with H=11.\n\nt_1=0, so:\n\nTurn 0: a_0 = S\n\nTurn 1: a_1 = S\n\nTurn 2: a_2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a_3 = U\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = U\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nIn the sequence, for Turn 2 to Turn 10, all U, which is 9 actions, plus two S at start.\n\nBut in the list, Turn 0 to Turn 10.\n\nNow, I need to confirm that at all times, no collision.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: after a0=S, y1=0, safe\n\nt=2: after a1=S, y2=0, safe\n\nt=3: after a2=U, y3=1, now row 1, time t=3, which is not t=2, so safe.\n\nt=4: y=2, row 2, t=4>2, safe.\n\nt=5: y=3, row 3, t=5>2, safe.\n\nt=6: y=4, row 4, t=6, row 4 unsafe only at t=2, not t=6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 is part of 1-6, unsafe only at t=2, so at t=6 safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, row 6, safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, row 7, time t=9, row 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8, t=9>8, so safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, row 8, t=10>8, safe.\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith U and D: at t=0: U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, row 1, t=1 !=2, safe, then a1=D, to y2=0\n\nThen same as above.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nBut in this case, at t=1 I was on row 1, which was safe.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need minimal H, which is 11.\n\nBut earlier I thought about rows 7-8, but in this sequence, I avoided them during unsafe times.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly but skip t=2 on low rows, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go to row 9 directly but slower, but that would take more time.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 0 at t=2, but then go faster to higher rows, but I can't go faster than one per step.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the car on row 7 and 8 again.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=6, y=4; t=7,y=5; t=8,y=6; not on 7 or 8.\n\nAt t=9,y=7; t=10,y=8; both after t=8, safe.\n\nBut t=9 and t=10 are safe.\n\nBut is there a car on row 9? No, always safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up immediately but stay at some point to avoid.\n\nFor example, at t=0: U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nThen at t=1: since at t=2 I need to not be on 1-6, so I must go to y=0 or something else.\n\nFrom y=1, I can go to y=0 (D), or y=1 (S), or y=2 (U).\n\nBut if I go to y=1 or y=2 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only go to y=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf I go to y=0 at t=1, but from t=0, if I do S, to y=0 at t=1, then at t=1, I can go to y=1, but then at t=2 y=1 unsafe, or stay y=0, or down not possible.\n\nSo only stay or go down to y=0, but y=0, same.\n\nNo other choices.\n\nThus, I must be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, I'll use the S,S then U*9.\n\nIn the actions, from t=0 to t=10.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can write it.\n\nBut in the freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nAnother thing: for row 7, at t=6,7,8, unsafe, but at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn my sequence, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I go to row 7 before t=6, but since I start low, I can't.\n\nFor example, to be on row 7 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, row 7 is safe.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=2, to y=7 at t=5, that would require 3 steps to gain 7, impossible, max to y=3 at t=5.\n\nt=2 y=0, after a2, t=3 y<=1, a3 t=4 y<=2, a4 t=5 y<=3.\n\nSo y=3 at t=5 max, cannot reach row 7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, max y=4, as in my sequence.\n\nSo no, cannot be on row 7 before t=9 in min time path.\n\nThus, my sequence is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, actions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write the sequence with indices.\n\nSince t_1=0, and turns are t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: a_0 = S\n\nTurn 1: a_1 = S\n\nTurn 2: a_2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a_3 = U\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = U\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 11.

I need to get to (0, 9) as quickly as possible, meaning minimal H turns, with actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThe grid has y from 0 to 9. y=0 is probably the start, and y=9 is the goal. But there are cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, which I need to avoid.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each freeway k (which corresponds to y=k, I think), there are cars with positions given at turn t_1.\n\nThe collision rule: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at time T, I collide. But note that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and I only arrive at y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSpan(T) is for the car at time T. So for freeway y_{T+1}, at time T, if 0 is in Span(T) for some car on y_{T+1}, but since I'm not on y_{T+1} until T+1, I don't collide at T. At T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I need to check if 0 is in Span(T+1) for cars on that freeway.\n\nLet me clarify the timing.\n\n- At each turn t, I choose an action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\n- After choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\n- Then, for collision check at time t+1: I am at position (0, y_{t+1}), and I need that for freeway y_{t+1}, at time t+1, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThe collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nSpan(T) is the car's position at time T.\n\nNow, for the car positions: they are given at time t_1, and for future times, we compute based on speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars at t_1 = 1.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): one car, head h = -12, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed s = 36. Since direction right, the car is moving right, so at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nFor left-moving, head and tail: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is the front, I think? But for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the left? I need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nThe problem says: \"head h, tail τ\", and for direction:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → moves right, so at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nSince direction is right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, -12]? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed), so head = -12, tail = -47.\n\nFor right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], h left, τ right? Let's see the example.\n\nIn freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but let's first understand.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at t_1, the span is from tail to head, with tail at left, head at right, so positions from τ to h, and it moves right, so both increase by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: head at left, tail at right, moves left, both decrease.\n\nBut in the given, all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: head -12, tail -47, right, speed 36. So at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -12]? Since right-moving, τ is left, h is right.\n\nThe problem says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 same as 1.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: head -24, tail -47, right, speed 24.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: three cars each, all right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFor freeway 7: cars (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is occupied on each freeway.\n\nSince I need to avoid collision when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn.\n\nFirst, I'm starting at y=0 at t=1. At t=1, I'm at (0,0), but freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 has no cars, so no collision at t=1. But I need to move to higher y.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is also not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nNow, at each turn, when I am at a certain y, I need that for that y, at that turn, 0 is not in the car span.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to compute for each freeway, at each time, whether 0 is occupied.\n\nBut time is discrete, turns.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number, with t_1 = 1.\n\nI need to find actions from t=1 to some t=1+H-1, so up to t=1+H-1, and at turn t=1+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nThe position after action: at turn t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nLet me define the state at the beginning of turn t.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think per turn.\n\nAt the start of turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen, at turn t, after moving, I am at (0, y_{t+1})? No.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T when I am on y_T.\n\nFrom the problem: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"you are on freeway y_T at turn T\".\n\nNow, when does y_T get set? Based on previous action.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, which was set by action a_{T-1}? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart at turn t_1=1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nI choose action a_{t_1} = a_1.\n\nThen, y_{t_1 +1} = y_2 = y_1 + Δy based on a_1.\n\nThen, at turn t=2, I am at y_2, and so on.\n\nThe position y_t is for the start of turn t, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"current turn is t_1\", and \"position (0, y_{t_1})\", so at turn t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}).\n\nThen after choosing a_{t_1}, we set y_{t_1 +1}, and at turn t_1 +1, position is (0, y_{t_1 +1}).\n\nSimilarly, collision at turn T means when we are at position (0, y_T), and for that freeway y_T, at time T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nTime T for the car is the same turn.\n\nSo for turn T, position y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nNow for the cars, we have their positions at time t_1=1, and we can compute for any T.\n\nSince t_1=1, ΔT = T - 1.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied, so I know when to avoid being on that row.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: one car, right-moving, head h=-12, tail τ=-47, speed s=36.\n\nAt time T, span for this car: since right-moving, [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-47 + 36(T-1), -12 + 36(T-1)]\n\n0 is in this span if -47 + 36(T-1) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 36(T-1)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nLet me solve the inequality for when 0 is covered.\n\nFor y=1:\n\nLower bound L = -47 + 36(T-1)\n\nUpper bound U = -12 + 36(T-1)\n\n0 in [L,U] if L ≤ 0 and U ≥ 0.\n\nSo -47 + 36(T-1) ≤ 0 and -12 + 36(T-1) ≥ 0\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 36(T-1) ≤ 0 => 36(T-1) ≤ 47 => T-1 ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T-1 ≤ 1 since T integer, T-1=1, T=2? 36*1=36<47, 36*2=72>47, so T-1 ≤ 1.305, so T-1=0 or1.\n\nT-1=0: L = -47 +0 = -47 ≤0, U= -12 >0? U= -12 +0 = -12 <0? Let's calculate properly.\n\nL = -47 + 36(T-1)\n\nU = -12 + 36(T-1)\n\n0 in [L,U] if L ≤ 0 ≤ U\n\nSo L ≤ 0: -47 + 36(T-1) ≤ 0 => 36(T-1) ≤ 47 => T-1 ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T-1 ≤ 1 since T integer, thus T-1=0 or T-1=1\n\nAnd U ≥ 0: -12 + 36(T-1) ≥ 0 => 36(T-1) ≥ 12 => T-1 ≥ 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333, so T-1 ≥ 1 since T integer, T-1 ≥ 1? T-1 ≥ 0.333, so for integer, T-1 ≥ 1? No, T-1 can be 0,1,2,... but U ≥0 requires T-1 ≥ 0.333, so T-1 ≥ 1 since integer, T-1=1,2,3,...\n\nT-1 min: since T-1 ≥ ceil(0.333) =1? ceil(0.333)=1, but 0.333, for T-1=0, U= -12 <0, not ≥0; T-1=1, U= -12+36=24>0.\n\nL ≤0: T-1=0, L=-47≤0; T-1=1, L=-47+36=-11≤0; T-1=2, L=-47+72=25>0, not ≤0.\n\nSo L ≤0 only for T-1=0 and T-1=1.\n\nU ≥0 for T-1≥1, since T-1=0: U=-12<0, not ≥0; T-1=1: U=24>0; etc.\n\nSo for 0 in [L,U], we need both L≤0 and U≥0.\n\nFor T-1=0: L=-47≤0, U=-12<0? -12<0, so U not ≥0, thus 0 not in span.\n\nFor T-1=1: L=-47+36=-11≤0, U=-12+36=24≥0, so yes, 0 in [-11,24]? -11 to 24, 0 is between.\n\nFor T-1=2: L=25>0, U=60>0, L>0 so 0 not in [25,60]\n\nSo only at T-1=1, i.e., T=2, 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nT-1=1, T=2.\n\nAt time T=2, for freeway y=1, 0 is in the car span.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, not occupied.\n\nT=2 only.\n\nNow, freeway y=2: same as y=1, car (-12,-47,right,36), so identical, so at T=2, 0 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=3: same, at T=2, 0 occupied.\n\nNow freeway y=4: car (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nHead h=-24, tail τ=-47, right, s=24.\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-47 + 24(T-1), -24 + 24(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if L ≤0 ≤ U, L= -47 +24(T-1), U= -24 +24(T-1)\n\nL ≤0: -47 +24(T-1) ≤0 => 24(T-1) ≤47 => T-1 ≤ 47/24 ≈ 1.958, so T-1 ≤1 since integer? 47/24=1.958, so T-1=0 or 1 or 2? T-1≤1.958, so T-1=0,1\n\nT-1=0: L=-47≤0\n\nT-1=1: L=-47+24=-23≤0\n\nT-1=2: L=-47+48=1>0, not ≤0\n\nU ≥0: -24 +24(T-1) ≥0 => 24(T-1) ≥24 => T-1 ≥1\n\nSo L≤0 for T-1=0,1\n\nU≥0 for T-1≥1\n\nThus both only when T-1=1: L=-23≤0, U=0? U= -24 +24(1) =0, so 0 in [-23,0], since U=0.\n\nU= -24 +24(T-1), T-1=1, U= -24+24=0, so [L,U]=[-23,0], so 0 is included.\n\nFor T-1=0: L≤0 but U=-24<0, not ≥0\n\nT-1=2: U= -24+48=24>0 but L=1>0, not ≤0\n\nSo only at T-1=1, T=2, 0 occupied on y=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 and y=6, same car, so at T=2, occupied.\n\nNow freeway y=7: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFor each car, compute when 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: head=52, tail=41? For right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [41,52]? Since τ=41, h=52, so [41,52] at t=1.\n\nThen at time T, [41 + 4(T-1), 52 + 4(T-1)]\n\n0 in this? Since 41 +4(T-1) ≥41>0 for T≥1, so U and L both positive, 0 not in, since min is 41>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=16, tail=5, so at t=1, [5,16]\n\nAt T, [5 +4(T-1), 16 +4(T-1)]\n\nMin at T=1 is 5>0, so always greater than 0, 0 never in.\n\nThird car: head=-20, tail=-31, right-moving, so at t=1, [τ, h] = [-31, -20]\n\nAt T, [-31 +4(T-1), -20 +4(T-1)]\n\n0 in this span if L ≤0 ≤ U\n\nL = -31 +4(T-1) ≤0\n\nU = -20 +4(T-1) ≥0\n\nL ≤0: -31 +4(T-1) ≤0 => 4(T-1) ≤31 => T-1 ≤31/4=7.75, so T-1 ≤7\n\nU ≥0: -20 +4(T-1) ≥0 => 4(T-1) ≥20 => T-1 ≥5\n\nSo both for T-1 from 5 to 7 inclusive.\n\nT-1=5,6,7\n\nT=6,7,8\n\nFor T-1=5: L= -31+20= -11≤0, U= -20+20=0≥0\n\nT-1=6: L= -31+24= -7≤0, U= -20+24=4≥0\n\nT-1=7: L= -31+28= -3≤0, U= -20+28=8≥0\n\nT-1=8: L= -31+32=1>0, not ≤0; U=12>0\n\nSo on freeway 7, 0 is occupied by the third car at times T=6,7,8.\n\nT-1=5,6,7 → T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, are there other cars? First two cars are always above 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway y=8, same as y=7, cars identical: (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4), so same, 0 occupied at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, freeway y=1 to 6: we have at T=2, 0 occupied.\n\ny=1,2,3 at T=2 occupied; y=4,5,6 at T=2 occupied; y=7 and 8 at T=6,7,8 occupied.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 at t=1 to y=9 at some turn, avoiding being on a freeway when 0 is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if I am on y_T between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at that T.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, minimal turns: I start at t=1, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo minimize H, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid the occupied times.\n\nThe occupied times: at T=2, rows y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are all occupied? y=1 to 6 all have 0 occupied at T=2.\n\ny=1,2,3: from earlier, at T=2 occupied.\n\ny=4,5,6: at T=2 occupied.\n\ny=7 and 8: occupied at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at t=1, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions to move up.\n\nBut at turn t=1, I choose a_1, which sets y_2.\n\nThen at turn t=2, I am at y_2, and so on.\n\nNow, at turn T=2, if I am on any y from 1 to 6, I will collide, because all are occupied at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6,7,8, if I am on y=7 or 8, collide.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 only occupied at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, since at T=2, all rows 1-6 are dangerous, I must not be on rows 1-6 at T=2.\n\nAt turn T=2, position y_2.\n\ny_2 must not be between 1 and 6 inclusive.\n\nSo y_2 must be 0, or 7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, but at T=2, if I am at y=9, that might be too early, but I can be there.\n\ny_2 is set by action at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, I am at y=0.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf a_1 = U, y_2 = 0 +1 =1\n\nIf D, y_2 = 0-1 = -1, but y must be in [0,9], so D not possible, since y=0, can't go down.\n\nIf S, y_2=0\n\nIf U, y_2=1\n\nBut y_2=1 is between 1 and 6, so at T=2, if y_2=1, I am on row 1, which is occupied, collide.\n\nIf y_2=0, by staying, then at T=2, I am on y=0, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but I need to move up eventually.\n\ny_2 cannot be 7,8,9 at t=2, because from y=0, I can only go to y=0 or y=1 at t=2.\n\nWith one action, from y=0, y_2 can be 0 (if S) or 1 (if U). D not possible.\n\nSo only options: y_2=0 or 1.\n\nBut y_2=1 is unsafe at T=2, so must choose S at t=1, so y_2=0.\n\nThus, at t=1, action must be S.\n\nThen at turn T=2, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, at turn t=2, I need to choose a_2, which sets y_3.\n\nNow, y_3 is for turn T=3.\n\nAt T=3, what is occupied?\n\nFrom earlier, for y=1 to 6: at T=2 occupied, but at T=3?\n\nLet me check.\n\nFor y=1: car, at T=3, ΔT=T-1=2, L= -47 +36*2 = -47+72=25, U= -12+72=60, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3 same.\n\ny=4: at T=3, ΔT=2, L= -47 +24*2 = -47+48=1>0, U= -24+48=24>0, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly y=5,6.\n\ny=7 and 8: occupied only at T=6,7,8, so at T=3, not occupied.\n\nSo at T=3, all freeways are safe, since no 0 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=4,5 should be safe, except later for y=7,8.\n\nT=4: ΔT=3, for y=1: L= -47+36*3= -47+108=61>0, etc. all good.\n\ny=7: at T=4, ΔT=3, for the car: L= -31 +4*3= -31+12= -19? ΔT=T-1=3 for T=4.\n\nT=4, T-1=3.\n\nFor y=7, third car: L= -31 +4(3) = -31+12= -19? 4*3=12, -31+12=-19 ≤0? U= -20+12= -8 <0? Earlier for occupied only at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=4, T-1=3, L= -31 +4*3= -31+12= -19 ≤0, U= -20 +12= -8 <0? U= -20 +4(3) = -20+12= -8 <0, so U<0, not ≥0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, min and max both negative, so no.\n\nT=5: T-1=4, L= -31+16= -15≤0, U= -20+16= -4<0, still U<0.\n\nT=6: T-1=5, L= -31+20= -11≤0, U= -20+20=0≥0, occupied.\n\nSo yes, T=3,4,5 all freeways are safe.\n\nT=6,7,8 y=7 and 8 occupied.\n\nT=9: for y=7, T=9, T-1=8, L= -31+32=1>0, U= -20+32=12>0, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nSo summary:\n\n- At T=2: y=1 to 6 occupied\n\n- At T=6,7,8: y=7 and 8 occupied\n\n- Other times and other rows safe.\n\nNow back to the game.\n\nAt t=1 (T=1), I am at y=0, choose a1=S, so y2=0.\n\nAt T=2, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nNow at turn t=2, I choose a2, which sets y3.\n\ny3 is for turn T=3.\n\nAt T=3, all rows safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly T=4,5 safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=0, I need to go up to y=9, which takes at least 9 steps up, but I can stay or go down, but that would increase turns, so minimal should be go up directly when possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nNow, at t=2, I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose U, so y3=1.\n\nOr S, y3=0, or D not possible.\n\nSince T=3 is safe for all, I should go up.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be careful around T=6,7,8 for rows 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's see the timeline.\n\nI am at T=2, y=0.\n\nI choose a2=U, so y3=1.\n\nAt T=3, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, at t=3, I choose a3, sets y4.\n\nI can go up to y2, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6,7,8 are turns when y=7 and 8 are occupied.\n\nNow, let me denote the turn and position.\n\nStart: T=1, y=0\n\nAfter a1=S, T=2, y=0\n\nNow a2: I choose U, so y3=1\n\nT=3, y=1\n\nNow at t=3, choose a3. I can go up to y=2 with U.\n\nSet y4=2.\n\nT=4, y=2\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, choose a4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3\n\nAt t=5, choose a5, sets y6 for T=6.\n\nT=6 is dangerous for y=7 and 8, but I am at y=3, which is fine.\n\nIf I go up, y6=4.\n\nT=6, y=4, which is safe, since y=4 not occupied at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, at T=5, y=3\n\nAfter a5, y6.\n\nIf a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, safe.\n\nAt t=6, choose a6, sets y7.\n\ny7 is for T=7.\n\nT=7 is dangerous for y=7 and 8.\n\nIf I am on y=7 at T=7, collide.\n\nSimilarly, I need to not be on y=7 or 8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at T=6, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to set y7 with action at t=6.\n\nPossible actions: U to y=5, D to y=3, S to y=4.\n\ny7 can be 3,4, or 5.\n\nNone of which are 7 or 8, so at T=7, I am on y=3,4, or5, all safe since not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut I need to go up to 9.\n\nThe dangerous rows are only 7 and 8 at times 6,7,8, but since I am below, I can go up slowly.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nFrom T=6, y=4.\n\nI can go up each turn.\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7, y=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8, y=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nNow T=9, y=7\n\nBut T=9, is y=7 occupied? At T=9, for y=7, not occupied, as we saw earlier, only T=6,7,8 occupied.\n\nT=9 is safe for all.\n\nSimilarly, a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10, y=8\n\nBut at T=10, y=8 not occupied, since only up to T=8.\n\nT=10 safe.\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=1, actions from t=1 to t=1+H-1.\n\nIn this sequence, I have actions from t=1 to t=10, which sets up to y11.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nTo be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nt=1: a1=S, sets y2=0\n\nT=2: y=0\n\nt=2: a2=U, sets y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1\n\nt=3: a3=U, sets y4=2\n\nT=4: y=2\n\nt=4: a4=U, sets y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3\n\nt=5: a5=U, sets y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4\n\nt=6: a6=U, sets y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5\n\nt=7: a7=U, sets y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6\n\nt=8: a8=U, sets y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7\n\nt=9: a9=U, sets y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8\n\nt=10: a10=U, sets y11=9\n\nT=11: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H is such that at turn t1 + H -1, I reach y=9.\n\nt1=1, so at turn 1 + H -1 = H, I am at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=11, y=11? T=11, y=11? No.\n\nThe turn when I am at y=9 is T=11.\n\nSince t1=1, T=1 + H -1 = H, so H=11.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=10, that's 10 actions, t from 1 to 10.\n\nNumber of actions H: from t=1 to t=1+H-1, so if actions at t=1,2,3,...,k, then k = t1 + H -1, and at turn k+1? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_t1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}, and we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"?\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFrom the text: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd in the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with a_t chosen at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, set y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at some turn, say at turn T, we have y_T =9.\n\nT = t1 + something.\n\nAfter H actions, from t1 to t1 + H -1, we have set y_{t1 +1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, set y_{t1 +1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 +1}, set y_{t1 +2}, ..., after action a_{t1 + H -1}, set y_{t1 + H}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe last action is at turn t1 + H -1, setting y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I have from t=1 to t=10 actions, 10 actions.\n\nt1=1.\n\nAfter a1 to a10, y11=9, so at turn 11, y=9.\n\nSo H=10 actions? H is the number of turns for actions, I think.\n\nt from 1 to 10, that's 10 turns of actions.\n\nH should be such that actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but here t1 fixed.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t1 to t1 + H -1, so for H actions.\n\nIn this case, with 10 actions, I reach y11=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI started with a1=S, which was necessary to avoid T=2 on row 1-6.\n\nThen from T=3 to T=10, I went up step by step, but I could go faster? From y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 up actions, but I have one stay, so 10 actions, which is 9 ups and one stay.\n\nCan I do with fewer?\n\nSuppose I don't stay at beginning.\n\nBut at t=1, if I go up, a1=U, y2=1, then at T=2, y=1, which is occupied, collide.\n\nMust stay or go down, but down not possible, so must stay at t=1.\n\nSo at least one stay.\n\nThen I need 9 up actions to go from 0 to 9.\n\nSo minimum 10 actions: one stay and nine ups, or something.\n\nIn my sequence, I have one S and nine U, total 10 actions.\n\nBut I could have downs, but that would increase actions, so not minimal.\n\nSo H=10 should be minimal.\n\nBut in my sequence, at T=6,7,8 I am at y=4,5,6, which are safe, and y=7,8 at T=9 and 10, which are safe since occupied only at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=9 and 10 are safe for y=7 and 8.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I try to go faster.\n\nAt T=2, I am at y=0.\n\nInstead of going up slowly, can I stay multiple times? But that would take longer.\n\nAfter T=2, all times except T=6,7,8 are safe, but T=6,7,8 only dangerous for y=7,8.\n\nI am starting from y=0, so I need to pass through the rows.\n\nThe critical part is to not be on y=7 or 8 during T=6,7,8.\n\nI can be on y=7 before T=6 or after T=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=7 at T=9, which is after T=8, safe.\n\nBut can I be on y=7 earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=5, what y can I be.\n\nAt T=2, y=0.\n\nThen I need to reach higher y.\n\nEach up increases y by one per turn.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=5, that's 3 turns: t=2,3,4 actions.\n\nAt t=2, choose a2 sets y3.\n\ny3 for T=3.\n\nI can go up each time.\n\na2=U, y3=1 (T=3)\n\na3=U, y4=2 (T=4)\n\na4=U, y5=3 (T=5)\n\nAt T=5, y=3.\n\nThen at t=5, set y6 for T=6.\n\nIf I go up, y6=4, T=6 y=4.\n\nThen as before.\n\nTo reach y=7 earlier, but at T=6, if I am on y=7, it is occupied, so I cannot be on y=7 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, cannot at T=7 or 8.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=7 is T=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, from T=2 y=0 to T=9 y=7.\n\nT=2 to T=9 is 7 turns, but positions.\n\nAt T=2, y=0\n\nThen T=3, y=1 (if up)\n\nT=4, y=2\n\nT=5, y=3\n\nT=6, y=4\n\nT=7, y=5\n\nT=8, y=6\n\nT=9, y=7\n\nThen T=10, y=8\n\nT=11, y=9\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nCan I be at y=7 at T=9 directly? I need to increase y from 0 to 7, which takes at least 7 up actions.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=9, there are 7 turns: T=3 to T=9.\n\nT=2: y=0\n\nAfter actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn T when position set.\n\nT=2: y=0\n\nThen action at t=2 (which is T=2), sets y3\n\nT=3: y3\n\n...\n\nUp to T=9: y9\n\nTo have y9=7.\n\nFrom T=2 y=0 to T=9 y=7, that requires increasing y by 7 in 7 steps? From T=2 to T=9, there are 7 intervals: from t=2 to t=8 actions? Actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 set y3 to y9.\n\ny3 to y9, that's 7 positions: y3,y4,y5,y6,y7,y8,y9.\n\nBut y3 is for T=3, up to y9 for T=9.\n\nTo go from y=0 at T=2 to y=7 at T=9, need to increase by 7, so exactly 7 up actions, no stay or down.\n\nSimilarly, then to y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo minimum 10 actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nt=1: a1=S, so y2=0\n\nThen t=2 to t=8: 7 actions to go from y=0 to y=7 at T=9? At T=2 y=0, after a2 to a8, set y3 to y9.\n\ny9=7.\n\nThen t=9: a9=U, set y10=8\n\nT=10 y=8\n\nt=10: a10=U, set y11=9\n\nT=11 y=9\n\nActions at t=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nSequence: t=1: S\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\n...\n\nt=10: U\n\nBut at t=1: S\n\nThen t=2 to t=10: U, that's 9 U, but from y=0 to y=9, need 9 U, but I have one S at start, so yes.\n\nIn terms of the sequence:\n\nTurn t1=1: a1 = S\n\nThen Turn t1+1=2: a2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a3=U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 10: a10=U\n\nAfter a10, y11=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=1 to t=10, that's 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 9, a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+9}, so a1 to a10, yes.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{1+10-1} = y_{10}, but we need y_{t1 + H} = y_{11} =9.\n\nInconsistency?\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nBut in my notation, at turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, t1=1, H=10, t1+H-1=10, y10 should be 9.\n\nBut in my sequence, at turn T=10, y=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the problem: \"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which set y_{t1 +1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, we set y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H} is the position at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nBut at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, and we choose a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nIf we are already at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1, then we don't need to move, but we might need to choose an action, but if we stay, y remains 9.\n\nIn this case, for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we can have action at t_{t1 + H -1} to be S or something.\n\nBut in minimal H, we might reach at the turn.\n\nIn my earlier, at T=11, y=9, which is turn 11.\n\nt1=1, so t1 + H -1 =11, so 1 + H -1 =11, H=11.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{11} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=1 to t=10? t from t1 to t1 + H -1 =1 to 10.\n\nt1 + H -1 =10 for H=11? t1 + H -1 =1 + 11 -1=11.\n\nActions for turns from t1 to t1 + H -1, so t=1 to 11? But at t=11, we choose action, but if we are at y=9, we might not need to act, but we have to choose an action to set y_{12}, but since we are at goal, we can stay or something.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once at y=9, we can stop, but in the sequence, we need to have y_{t1 + H -1}=9, and we have actions up to that point.\n\nFor example, at turn t_{t1 + H -1}, we are at y=9, and we choose some action, but since we are already at goal, we can choose S.\n\nIn terms of the number, with H=11 actions.\n\nIn my sequence, I have 10 actions to reach y11=9 at turn 11.\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + H -1} = y_H =9, since t1=1.\n\ny_k for turn k.\n\nAt turn k, y_k.\n\nSet y_{k} at turn k? Earlier confusion.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nChoose a_t, set y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn, y_T =9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1? From the problem.\n\n\"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we are at y_{t1 + H -1}, and we choose a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care about y_{t1 + H}, since we reached at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor minimal H, we can choose to stay at the last turn or something.\n\nIn my case, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nt1=1, so y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo 1 + H -1 =11, thus H=11.\n\nThen actions from turn 1 to turn 10? t1 to t1 + H -1 =1 to 1+11-1=11.\n\nSo actions at turn 1 to turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y=9, and we choose a_{11}, which could be S, but since we are at goal, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, for the first 10 actions, we go to y=9 at turn 11, then at turn 11, we choose a_{11}=S to stay, but it's not necessary, but to have the action.\n\nSince we reach at turn 11, with H=11, actions from t=1 to t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, we need to choose an action, but y is already 9.\n\nIn the minimal sequence, I can have y_{t1 + H -1} =9 with fewer actions if I reach earlier.\n\nFor example, can I reach y=9 at an earlier turn?\n\nEarliest possible: from start.\n\nAt t=1, y=0.\n\nIf I could go up immediately, but at T=2, if y=1, collide, so must stay at t=1, y2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen from T=2 y=0, I can start going up.\n\nEach up increases y by one per turn.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=0, need 9 up actions.\n\nThe turns: after first action at t=1, y2=0.\n\nThen after 9 up actions, y_{11}=9, at turn 11.\n\nWith actions: t=1: S, sets y2=0\n\nt=2: U, y3=1\n\n...\n\nt=10: U, y11=9\n\nThen at turn t=11, y=9, but we need to have action at t=11 for the sequence up to t1+H-1=11.\n\nSo we need to include an action at t=11.\n\nSince y=9, we can choose S.\n\nSo sequence: t=1: S\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U  // now at turn 11, y=9\n\nThen t=11: S (or anything, but S to stay)\n\nIn the sequence, at t=10, action U sets y11=9, so at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, we choose a_{11}, say S, which sets y12=9, but we don't care.\n\nSince y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{11} =9 with H=11.\n\nt1 + H -1 =1 + H -1 =11, so H=11.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=11.\n\nBut the last action at t=11 is not necessary for reaching, but it is part of the sequence.\n\nTo save one action, but I need to reach at turn 10 or earlier.\n\nCan I reach y=9 at turn 10?\n\nAt turn 10, y=9.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nFrom start, at t=1, y=0.\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, need to increase from 0 to 9 in 9 actions? From t=1 to t=9 actions set y2 to y10.\n\ny2 to y10, 9 positions.\n\nTo go from y=0 at turn 1 to y=9 at turn 10, need to increase by 9, so 9 up actions from t=1 to t=9.\n\nBut at t=1, if I choose U, y2=1, then at T=2, y=1, which is occupied, collide.\n\nMust choose S at t=1, so y2=0.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=9, 8 actions to set y3 to y10.\n\nTo go from y=0 at T=2 to y=9 at T=10, need to increase by 9, but only 8 actions? y3 to y10 is 8 steps.\n\ny3 set by a2, ..., y10 set by a9.\n\nSo from y2=0 to y10=9, with 8 actions (t=2 to t=9), impossible, since each action changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9 in 8 actions, minimum change is 8, so y10 <= 8 if start from y2=0.\n\ny2=0, after a2, y3 <=1, ..., after a9, y10 <=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 before turn 11.\n\nEarliest at turn 11.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to avoid the other dangerous times.\n\nIn my sequence, I pass y=7 at T=9, y=8 at T=10, both after T=8, so safe.\n\nAnd I don't hit y=7 or 8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: S  // sets y2=0\n\nTurn 2: U  // sets y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U  // sets y4=2\n\nTurn 4: U  // sets y5=3\n\nTurn 5: U  // sets y6=4\n\nTurn 6: U  // sets y7=5\n\nTurn 7: U  // sets y8=6\n\nTurn 8: U  // sets y9=7\n\nTurn 9: U  // sets y10=8\n\nTurn 10: U  // sets y11=9\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9, but we need action at turn 11 for the sequence.\n\nSince H=11, actions up to turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y=9, choose a_{11}=S, sets y12=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nIn the sequence, all actions from t=1 to t=11.\n\nBut the minimal H is 11.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 1 to turn 10, we have 10 actions, reaching y11=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen for turn 11, we add S.\n\nBut with H=11, we include turn 11 action.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 6, I set y7=5, etc., all safe.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I collide.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nT=3, y=1, is it occupied? At T=3, for y=1, not occupied, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, T=4, y=2, safe.\n\nT=5, y=3, safe.\n\nT=6, y=4, safe.\n\nT=7, y=5, safe.\n\nT=8, y=6, safe.\n\nT=9, y=7, at T=9, y=7 not occupied.\n\nT=10, y=8, not occupied.\n\nT=11, y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turns t=1 to t=11.\n\nBut t=1 to t=10 are U except first S, and t=11 S.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nt1=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S  // but we can choose anything, but S is fine.\n\nSince at turn 10, with U, we set y11=9, so at turn 11 we are at y=9, and we choose S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 11 action is part of it.\n\nTo minimize actions, but H=11 is fixed.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 11, since we are at goal, we don't need to do anything, but the action is required in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can reach and not have the last action, but according to the problem, we need to specify actions up to when we reach.\n\nBut with y_{t1+H-1}=9, and actions to that turn.\n\nIn this case, with H=11, it works.\n\nIf I can have y_{10}=9, but earlier we saw impossible.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars on y=7 and 8, but in this path, I don't go near them at dangerous times.\n\nIn the sequence, I have all actions except the first and last are U, but first is S, last is S? Turn 1 S, turn 2 to 10 U, turn 11 S.\n\nBut turn 2 to 10 is 9 U actions.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I already computed the occupation times.\n\nIn freeway 7, at T=6,7,8, 0 is occupied, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThe answer should be H=11, and the sequence.\n\nBut in the box, only the actions, not H.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the actions, but H should be implied.\n\nIn the box, it lists the actions for each turn.\n\nSo for this case:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut turn 11 is included.\n\nSince at turn 10, we set y11=9, and at turn 11 we are at y=9, so for turn 11, we can choose any action, but S is safe.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to specify beyond, but according to the sequence up to t1+H-1.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 10, after action U, y11=9, so at turn 11, we are at y=9, which is the state at turn t1 + H -1 if H=11, t1+H-1=11.\n\nIf I set H=10, then t1+H-1=10, y10 should be 9.\n\nBut y10=8 in my sequence, not 9.\n\nCan I have y10=9?\n\nAs before, from y2=0 at T=2, to y10=9 at T=10, need to increase by 9 in 8 actions (t=2 to t=9), impossible.\n\nSo must be H=11.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nt_1 =1\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: a_{1} = S\n\nTurn 2: a_{2} = U\n\nTurn 3: a_{3} = U\n\nTurn 4: a_{4} = U\n\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U\n\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = S\n\nIn the answer, it should be from t=1 to t=11.\n\nBut in the box, it might be listed.\n\nPerhaps I can have the last action different, but S is fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the sequence, from turn 3 to 10, all U, but I could have stayed somewhere, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nSo this should be the minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at turn 6, when I set y7, but y7=5, which is fine.\n\nSuppose I try to go faster to avoid, but I think not possible.\n\nSo I believe this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when the position \\(x = 0\\) is occupied by a car at that turn.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Initial action at turn 1**: Must be \"S\" (stay) because moving up (\"U\") would place the player at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2, where all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are occupied at \\(T = 2\\), causing a collision. Staying keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe.\n- **Dangerous turns and freeways**:\n  - At turn \\(T = 2\\), freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are occupied; player must not be on these rows.\n  - At turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\), freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are occupied; player must not be on these rows during these turns.\n- **Path to \\(y = 9\\)**: \n  - The player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (turn 1).\n  - After staying at turn 1, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 2 (safe).\n  - From turn 2 to turn 10, the player moves up (\"U\") every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11.\n  - At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) and chooses \"S\" to stay, as the goal is reached. This action is required for the sequence but does not affect the position.\n- **Collision avoidance**:\n  - At no point is the player on a freeway when \\(x = 0\\) is occupied (e.g., not on \\(y = 1-6\\) at \\(T = 2\\), not on \\(y = 7-8\\) at \\(T = 6-8\\)).\n  - The sequence ensures the player is on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9 (after the dangerous period) and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10 (after the dangerous period), both safe.\n- **Minimal \\(H\\)**: \n  - Reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 9 upward moves. However, due to the initial stay (to avoid \\(T = 2\\) collision), 10 actions are needed to set \\(y_{11} = 9\\), and an 11th action (at turn 11) is required since \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{11} = 9\\). Thus, \\(H = 11\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=1}^{11}\\) is as follows:\n\n```\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 1 (action S)**: Position at turn 2 is \\((0, 0)\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- **Turn 2 (action U)**: Position at turn 3 is \\((0, 1)\\) (safe; \\(y = 1\\) not occupied at \\(T = 3\\)).\n- **Turn 3 (action U)**: Position at turn 4 is \\((0, 2)\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 4 (action U)**: Position at turn 5 is \\((0, 3)\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 5 (action U)**: Position at turn 6 is \\((0, 4)\\) (safe; \\(y = 4\\) not occupied at \\(T = 6\\)).\n- **Turn 6 (action U)**: Position at turn 7 is \\((0, 5)\\) (safe; not \\(y = 7-8\\) at \\(T = 7\\)).\n- **Turn 7 (action U)**: Position at turn 8 is \\((0, 6)\\) (safe; not \\(y = 7-8\\) at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- **Turn 8 (action U)**: Position at turn 9 is \\((0, 7)\\) (safe; \\(y = 7\\) not occupied at \\(T = 9\\)).\n- **Turn 9 (action U)**: Position at turn 10 is \\((0, 8)\\) (safe; \\(y = 8\\) not occupied at \\(T = 10\\)).\n- **Turn 10 (action U)**: Position at turn 11 is \\((0, 9)\\) (goal reached).\n- **Turn 11 (action S)**: Position at turn 12 is \\((0, 9)\\), but goal is already achieved at turn 11.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns \\(H = 11\\) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t_1 = 2 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t_1=2, and I need to know where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions. A collision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for a car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that exact turn T.\n\nThe key point is that when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if they move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T they are still on y, and only on y+1 at turn T+1. That affects when collisions are checked.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their states at t_1=2.\n\nFor freeways 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head 24, tail -11, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]. Head and tail: I think head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail. In the span, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (h=24, τ=-11, d=right, s=36)\n\nSince direction is right, the car is moving right, so at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? No.\n\nFrom the car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nFor right-moving, in the update, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving. But in the table, it's listed as (head, tail), so I think for consistency, head might be the front, tail the back.\n\nFor right-moving, front is larger x, so if head is front, then for right-moving, h > τ, and Span(t_1) = [τ, h] meaning from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head would be smaller x if moving left.\n\nBut in the update rule, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which might imply h < τ since it's moving left.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the right-moving case from the update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's (24, -11, right, 36), so I think τ is tail, h is head, and since right-moving, head > tail.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor freeway 1: at t_1=2, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 24] for right-moving? Update says for right-moving Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so with τ = -11, h = 24, so [-11, 24].\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] = [-11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same as freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36), so identical.\n\nFreeway 4: (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nSo Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, 0] for right-moving? h=0, τ=-23, so [ -23, 0 ] at t_1=2.\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] = [-23 + 24(T-2), 0 + 24(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (56, 45, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4), (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFor each, at t_1=2, spans:\n\nFirst car: h=56, τ=45, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [45, 56]\n\nSecond car: h=20, τ=9, Span(t_1) = [9, 20]\n\nThird car: h=-16, τ=-27? τ=-27, h=-16, Span(t_1) = [-27, -16]\n\nThen at time T, for each car, Span(T) = [τ + 4(T-2), h + 4(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t=2, and needs to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9 since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once at y=9, no collision possible, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is on the grid, y=9.\n\nBut freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, where player starts, and y=9 is the target.\n\nCollision only possible when on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, since player can only move up, down, or stay, and starts at y=0, ends at y=9, the minimum number of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 up moves, so H=9, but there might be cars blocking, so I might need to wait or move down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but here current turn is t_1=2, so actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=2+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nThe player update: at turn t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, action determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at turn t_1=2, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0), so y_2 = 0.\n\nThen after action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} = 9, I think.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + 0, t_1 + 1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position at time t_1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nBecause: after action a_t at time t, position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time t_1, position is given, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at time t_1, y_{t_1 + 1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + k} at time t_1 + k, y_{t_1 + k + 1} = y_{t_1 + k} + Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nSo after H actions, from t= t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, we have y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd at time t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nThe player is at y_{t_1 + H} = 9, which is safe.\n\nNow, during the path, for each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, when the player is at y_T, which is between 1 and 8, we need that for the car on that freeway, 0 is not in the span at time T.\n\ny_T is the position at the start of turn T, and after action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn T, the player is on y_T, and we check for collision on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf the player moves to a different y, at turn T they are still on y_T, not on the new one yet.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, player is on y, and moves to y+1, then at turn T, they are on y, so check collision on y at time T. Then at turn T+1, they are on y+1, so check on y+1 at time T+1.\n\nNow, the cars move continuously, so at each integer time, we have the span.\n\nt_1=2 is current time.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in min H.\n\nFirst, let's find where the cars are at different times, specifically when their span includes 0, because that's when collision happens if player is on that row.\n\nCollision if at time T, player on freeway i, and 0 in span of some car on i at T.\n\nSo for each freeway i, I need to know for which times T, 0 is in the span of the car(s) on i.\n\nThen for the player path, when on row i at time T, that T must not be a time when 0 is in span for that row.\n\nFor rows with multiple cars, I need to check all cars on that row.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=36, span at T: [ -11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span when -11 + 36(T-2) <= 0 <= 24 + 36(T-2)\n\nSimilarly, since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nSet A = T - 2, so time offset.\n\nThen 0 in span if -11 + 36A <= 0 <= 24 + 36A\n\nNow, -11 + 36A <= 0 implies 36A <= 11, A <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nAnd 0 <= 24 + 36A always true since 24 + 36A >=24 >0 for all A.\n\n0 <= 24 + 36A is true for all A, since min is 24 at A=0.\n\nBut the inequality is -11 + 36A <= 0 <= 24 + 36A\n\n0 <= 24 + 36A is always true for A >=0, which it is since T >= t_1.\n\nSimilarly, the left part: -11 + 36A <= 0, so A <= 11/36\n\nAnd right part 0 <= 24 + 36A, always true.\n\nBut also, since it's <=, at equality it might be included, I think we consider it collided if exactly at endpoint.\n\nThe span includes the points, so if 0 is equal to left or right, it's included, so collision.\n\nNow, -11 + 36A <= 0 <= 24 + 36A\n\nWith 0 <= 24 + 36A always true for T>=2, A>=0.\n\nSo only constraint is -11 + 36A <= 0, so A <= 11/36\n\nSince A integer? T is integer turn, so A = T-2 is integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSo A = T-2, integer >=0.\n\n-11 + 36A <= 0\n\n36A <= 11\n\nA <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so A <= 0 since A integer.\n\nA=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0, and 0 <=24, true.\n\nA=1: -11 +36=25 >0, so -11+36A=25 >0, so -11+36A <=0 false? Let's see:\n\nThe inequality is -11 +36A <= 0 and 0 <= 24 +36A\n\nFor A=0: -11 <=0 true, 0<=24 true, so 0 in span.\n\nFor A=1: -11+36=25, 25 <=0? False, 25 >0, so -11+36A <=0 false, so 0 not in left part, but we need both conditions.\n\n0 in span if lower bound <=0 and upper bound >=0.\n\nLower bound L = -11 +36A\n\nUpper bound U = 24 +36A\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <=0 and U >=0.\n\nFor A=0: L= -11 <=0, U=24>=0, true.\n\nA=1: L= -11+36=25, 25 <=0? False, U=24+36=60>=0 true, but L=25>0, so 0 not <= U? 0 <= U is true, but L <=0 is false, so since L=25>0, U=60>0, 0 not in [25,60], so no.\n\nSimilarly for other A.\n\nA=0: L=-11<=0, U=24>=0, yes\n\nA=1: L=25>0, U=60>0, 0 not in [25,60]\n\nA=2: L= -11+72=61>0, U=24+72=96>0, no\n\nFor A<0, but T>=t_1=2, A>=0, so only at A=0, T=2, 0 in span for freeway 1.\n\nA=0, T=2.\n\nNow, for freeway 2 and 3, same as freeway 1, since identical cars.\n\nSo for y=1,2,3, at T=2, 0 is in the car span, so if player is on y=1,2, or 3 at T=2, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=0 at T=2, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] = [-23 + 24(T-2), 0 + 24(T-2)] = [-23 + 24A, 24A] where A=T-2\n\n0 in span if L <=0 and U>=0\n\nL = -23 +24A\n\nU = 24A\n\nU=24A >=0 always for A>=0\n\nL <=0: -23 +24A <=0 => 24A <=23 => A <= 23/24 ≈ 0.958, so A=0\n\nA=0: L=-23 <=0, U=0 >=0, so 0 in [-23,0], yes.\n\nA=1: L= -23+24=1, U=24, L=1>0, U=24>0, 0 not in [1,24]\n\nSo only at T=2, A=0, 0 in span for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nEach with speed 4.\n\nFor first car: h=56, τ=45, so span at T: [τ +4(T-2), h +4(T-2)] = [45 +4A, 56 +4A] where A=T-2\n\n0 in span? L=45+4A, U=56+4A, both positive for A>=0, min L at A=0 is 45>0, so L>0, U>0, so 0 not in [45+4A,56+4A] for any A.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=20, τ=9, span [9+4A, 20+4A]\n\nL=9+4A >=9>0 for A>=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: h=-16, τ=-27, span [τ +4A, h +4A] = [-27 +4A, -16 +4A]\n\n0 in span if L <=0 and U>=0\n\nL = -27+4A <=0\n\nU = -16+4A >=0\n\nL <=0: -27+4A <=0 => 4A <=27 => A <= 27/4 = 6.75\n\nU >=0: -16+4A >=0 => 4A >=16 => A >=4\n\nSo for A from 4 to 6.75, since A integer, A=4,5,6\n\nA=4: L= -27+16= -11 <=0, U= -16+16=0 >=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nA=5: L= -27+20= -7 <=0, U= -16+20=4 >=0, 0 in [-7,4]\n\nA=6: L= -27+24= -3 <=0, U= -16+24=8 >=0, 0 in [-3,8]\n\nA=7: L= -27+28=1 >0, U= -16+28=12>0, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for third car, 0 in span at T when A=4,5,6, i.e., T=6,7,8\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same cars, so identical.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when 0 in car span, so unsafe to be on that row at that time.\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nFor y=1 to 6, only unsafe at T=2.\n\nFor y=7 and 8, unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nPlayer starts at T=2, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H: since from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 up moves, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nAt T=2, y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are all unsafe because 0 in span for each at T=2.\n\nBut player is at y=0 at T=2.\n\nAt turn T=2, player is at y=0, which is safe.\n\nAction a_2 will determine y_3.\n\nIf we do U at T=2, y_3 = y_2 +1 = 0+1=1, so at turn T=3, player is on y=1.\n\nNow, at T=3, what is the state?\n\nFor y=1, at T=3, is it safe?\n\nFrom above, for y=1, only unsafe at T=2, not at T=3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's find for each row, when it is unsafe.\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=2\n\nAt T=3, for y=1, car: at T, span [ -11 +36(T-2), 24 +36(T-2) ]\n\nAt T=3, A=1, L= -11+36=25, U=24+36=60, so [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3 same.\n\ny=4: at T=3, A=1, L= -23 +24=1, U=24, [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5,6.\n\ny=7 and 8: unsafe only at T=6,7,8? T=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\ny=7: at T=6,7,8 unsafe, else safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nNow, player must go through rows 1 to 8 to reach 9.\n\nSince we start at T=2, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn after H actions.\n\nSince we can only move one step at a time, the path must go through each y from 0 to 9, but we can stay or move down, so not necessarily visit all, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, we must increase y by 9, so at least 9 up moves, and possibly some down or stay, but to minimize H, we should minimize down and stay, so probably mostly up.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nNow, at T=2, we are at y=0.\n\nIf we go up immediately, at T=2, action U, then y_3 =1.\n\nAt turn T=3, player is on y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 is safe at T=3, as above.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut let's see for later times.\n\nFirst, the unsafe times for rows 7 and 8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6,7,8 are turns where if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nNow, current time is T=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal time: if we go straight up, each turn move up, from y=0 at T=2, to y=1 at T=3, y=2 at T=4, ..., up to y=9 at T=11.\n\nAfter action at T=2, y_3=1\n\nAction at T=3, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nAction at T=10, y_11=9\n\nSo at turn T=11, y=9.\n\nH actions: from t=2 to t=2+H-1, y at t=2+H is 9.\n\nSet t_start = t_1 =2\n\nActions at t=2,3,4,..., up to t=2+H-1\n\nPosition after action: at time t+1, y_{t+1}\n\nAfter last action at t=2+H-1, y_{2+H} =9\n\nSo for straight up: start y_2=0\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo actions from t=2 to t=10, that's 9 actions, H=9, and at T=11, y=9.\n\nNow, during this, at each turn, when on row 1 to 8, check if safe.\n\nAt turn T=3: on y=1, time T=3.\n\ny=1 safe at T=3? Yes, as above.\n\nT=4: on y=2, safe? y=2 only unsafe at T=2, not T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly T=5: on y=3, safe.\n\nT=6: on y=4, safe? y=4 unsafe only at T=2, T=6 should be safe.\n\ny=4: at T=6, A=T-2=4, L= -23 +24*4 = -23+96=73, U=24*4=96? U=24A=96, so [73,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly T=7: on y=5, A=5, L= -23+120=97, U=120, safe.\n\nT=8: on y=6, A=6, L= -23+144=121, U=144, safe.\n\nNow T=9: on y=7, time T=9.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=6,7,8? T=6,7,8.\n\nT=9 is not unsafe.\n\ny=7 at T=9: A=T-2=7\n\nFor y=7 cars: first car span [45+4A,56+4A] at A=7, [45+28=73,56+28=84], 0 not in\n\nSecond car [9+28=37,20+28=48], 0 not in\n\nThird car: at A=7, L= -27+28=1, U= -16+28=12, [1,12], 0 not in? 0 <= L=1? 0 <1, not >=1, so 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly T=10: on y=8, time T=10.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=10: A=8\n\nCars: similar, spans all positive, safe.\n\nThen T=11: on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo in this straight up path, all safe, and H=9.\n\nBut is that possible? At T=6,7,8, the player is on y=4,5,6 at those times, which are not y=7 or 8, so safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn T | Position y_T | Action a_T | y_{T+1} | Collision check at T on y_T\n\nT=2: y_2=0, a_2=U (say), y_3=1, check at T=2: on y=0, no cars, safe.\n\nT=3: y_3=1, a_3=U, y_4=2, check at T=3: on y=1, safe (not unsafe time)\n\nT=4: y_4=2, a_4=U, y_5=3, check T=4: y=2 safe\n\nT=5: y_5=3, a_5=U, y_6=4, check T=5: y=3 safe? y=3 unsafe only at T=2, T=5 safe.\n\nT=6: y_6=4, a_6=U, y_7=5, check T=6: on y=4, safe (y=4 unsafe only T=2)\n\nT=7: y_7=5, a_7=U, y_8=6, check T=7: on y=5, safe\n\nT=8: y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7, check T=8: on y=6, safe? y=6 unsafe only T=2, T=8 safe.\n\nT=9: y_9=7, a_9=U, y_10=8, check T=9: on y=7, which is safe at T=9, as above.\n\nT=10: y_10=8, a_10=U, y_11=9, check T=10: on y=8, safe at T=10.\n\nThen y_11=9, done.\n\nSo with all U, H=9, it works.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and it seems 9 is achievable.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor y=7 and 8, unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nIn the path above, at T=6, player is on y=4, not y=7 or 8.\n\nAt T=7, on y=5.\n\nAt T=8, on y=6.\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen at T=9, on y=7, safe; T=10 on y=8, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? But with all U, H=9, which is minimum since we need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, so H=9 is minimum possible, no way to do in less than 9 turns.\n\nWith down or stay, we take more turns, so H>9, so minimal is 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=2 to t=10, H=9 actions.\n\nBut at turn t_1=2, action a_2, etc.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the sequence.\n\nBut is there a problem at start?\n\nAt T=2, if we do S, stay, y_3=0, but then we need more moves to go up, so H larger, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, y=0 is min, so we can't go below, so D at y=0 might keep y=0 or do nothing, but y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so at y=0, if D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, similarly at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nSo to minimize H, we should not do S or D unnecessarily.\n\nIn this case, all U works.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=4 at T=2.\n\nFreeway 4: at T=2, span [-23,0], so 0 is included, so if player were on y=4 at T=2, collision, but player is at y=0.\n\nIn the path, at T=2, player on y=0.\n\nWhen does player reach y=4? At T=6, on y=4, but T=6, not T=2.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and 8, at T=6,7,8 unsafe, but in the path, player is not on them at those times.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the car states were given at t_1=2, and I think I used them correctly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving faster, but we can't, since only +1 per turn max.\n\nUnless we start from different action.\n\nBut with all U, it works.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, at T=6, y=7 unsafe, but in path, player on y=4 at T=6.\n\nT=7 on y=5, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=9 with all up actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: from turn t_1=2 to turn 2+H-1=10.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: U\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 + H -1, with H=9, t_1=2, so t_1 + H -1 = 2+9-1=10, yes.\n\nSo actions at turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 all U.\n\nAnd player reaches y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify each action.\n\nBut is there any reason to do something else? Probably not.\n\nBut let me confirm the third car on y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9, A=7, third car span [ -27 +4*7, -16 +4*7] = [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly at T=10, A=8, [ -27+32=5, -16+32=16], [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? For example, if we start moving faster, but we can't, since we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we are already at higher y, but we start at y=0.\n\nSo H=9 is minimum.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nAnother thing: the player position at time T is y_T, and collision checked at that T.\n\nIn the sequence above, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps at T=2, if we do nothing, but that delays.\n\nOr if we go down, but at y=0, D does nothing.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut turns from 2 to 10, that's 9 actions.\n\nt_1=2, H=9, actions at t=2 to t=10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision rule.\n\nAnother point: when the player moves to a new row, they are not on it until next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if on y, and move to y+1, at turn T they are on y, check collision on y.\n\nAt turn T+1, on y+1, check on y+1.\n\nIn our case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for rows 7 and 8 at T=6,7,8, if player were to be on them, but not.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we want to be on y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, if we could be on y=7 at T=5, but with min moves, from y=0 at T=2, after 3 moves, at T=5, y=3, not 7.\n\nImpossible to be at y=7 before T=9 with all U: at T=3 y=1, T=4 y=2, ..., T=9 y=7.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=9, y=7, which is after T=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we start from higher, but no.\n\nSo I think H=9 is achievable and minimal.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case, it is 9.\n\nBut let me see if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nThe car on freeway 4 at T=2 has span including 0, but player not there.\n\nAnother thing: the freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at T=6,7,8, unsafe, but T=6 is turn 6, etc.\n\nPerhaps I should list the times.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nT=6 is turn 6, which is t_1 +4, since 2+4=6.\n\nIn the path, player at T=6 is on y=4, which is fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U from turn 2 to turn 10.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be written as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 + H -1 = 2 + 9 -1 =10.\n\nYes.\n\nSince all same, but I think we need to write each.\n\nPerhaps we can write it compactly, but I think per the format, list each turn.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be paranoid, suppose at some point we need to avoid, but in this case, no need.\n\nFor example, if we were to be on y=7 at T=8, but in the path we are at y=6 at T=8, which is safe.\n\ny=6 at T=8: freeway 6, which has car, but unsafe only at T=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Unsafe Times\n- **Freeways 1, 2, and 3**: Each has a car with initial span \\([-11, 24]\\) at \\(t_1 = 2\\), moving right at speed 36. The car spans include 0 only at \\(T = 2\\). Thus, these freeways are unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeways 4, 5, and 6**: Each has a car with initial span \\([-23, 0]\\) at \\(t_1 = 2\\), moving right at speed 24. The car spans include 0 only at \\(T = 2\\). Thus, these freeways are unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 7**: Has three cars:\n  - Car 1: Span \\([45, 56]\\) at \\(t_1 = 2\\), moving right at speed 4. 0 is never in the span.\n  - Car 2: Span \\([9, 20]\\) at \\(t_1 = 2\\), moving right at speed 4. 0 is never in the span.\n  - Car 3: Span \\([-27, -16]\\) at \\(t_1 = 2\\), moving right at speed 4. 0 is in the span at \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\) (since \\(A = T - 2\\), and for \\(A = 4, 5, 6\\), the span contains 0).\n  Thus, freeway 7 is unsafe at \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Identical to freeway 7, so unsafe at \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\).\n\n### Path to Minimize \\(H\\)\nThe player must increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9, requiring at least 9 \"U\" (up) actions, as each \"U\" increases \\(y\\) by 1. Any \"S\" (stay) or \"D\" (down) action would increase \\(H\\) beyond 9, so the minimal \\(H\\) is achieved by moving up continuously if safe.\n\n- At \\(T = 2\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars on \\(y = 0\\)).\n- Moving up each turn:\n  - \\(T = 3\\): \\(y = 1\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 3\\)).\n  - \\(T = 4\\): \\(y = 2\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 4\\)).\n  - \\(T = 5\\): \\(y = 3\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 5\\)).\n  - \\(T = 6\\): \\(y = 4\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 6\\)).\n  - \\(T = 7\\): \\(y = 5\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 7\\)).\n  - \\(T = 8\\): \\(y = 6\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 8\\)).\n  - \\(T = 9\\): \\(y = 7\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 9\\)).\n  - \\(T = 10\\): \\(y = 8\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 10\\)).\n- After action at \\(T = 10\\), \\(y_{11} = 9\\), reaching the goal.\n\nThis path uses 9 actions (all \"U\") and avoids all collisions. Since 9 is the minimum possible \\(H\\) (due to the 9-step increase in \\(y\\)), it is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 2\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2 + 9 - 1 = 10\\) is all \"U\":\n\n- Turn 2: U\n- Turn 3: U\n- Turn 4: U\n- Turn 5: U\n- Turn 6: U\n- Turn 7: U\n- Turn 8: U\n- Turn 9: U\n- Turn 10: U\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn t1 = 3 at position (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the freeway they are on at that turn) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player moves at the same time as the cars. When we take an action at turn T, we move to y_{T+1} at the next turn. However, at turn T, we are still on the freeway we were at the beginning of the turn (y_T). So the collision check at turn T is based on the freeway y_T and the car positions at turn T.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- For a left-moving car: the car moves to the left. The span at time T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n  But note: the given state is at t1=3. So for any turn T, we compute the span relative to t1=3.\n\n- For a right-moving car: the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nIn our case, all cars are right-moving. So for a car with head h and tail τ (and note that for right-moving, the head is at the right end, so the span at time t1 is [τ, h] and moves to the right.\n\nBut note: the description says for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=3.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (from 1 to 8) the car spans at each future turn T (starting from T=3).\n\nWe start at turn 3 at y=1. We are at freeway 1 at turn 3? Actually, the player is at (0,1) at turn 3, so they are on freeway 1 at turn 3.\n\nBut note: the freeways are y=1 to y=8. The player starts at y=1 (so freeway 1) at turn 3.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 (which is not a freeway, so no cars there) at some turn. Note that the grid goes from y=0 to y=9. The freeways are only from y=1 to y=8. So when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. However, we start at y=1 and must end at y=9.\n\nThe actions: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y unchanged). And we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nLet me note the car configurations at t1=3:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (60,25,right,36) -> at turn 3: span [25,60] (since right-moving: tail is 25, head is 60). But wait, the table says \"Cars\" and lists one car per freeway for freeways 1 to 6, but for 7 and 8, there are three cars.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (60,25,right,36) -> so at time 3: [25,60] and moving right at speed 36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car: (60,25,right,36) -> [25,60]\nfreeway 3: same -> [25,60]\n\nFreeway 4: (24,1,right,24) -> [1,24]\nfreeway 5: same -> [1,24]\nfreeway 6: same -> [1,24]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: \n  (60,49,right,4) -> [49,60]\n  (24,13,right,4) -> [13,24]\n  (-12,-23,right,4) -> [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: \n  [49,60], [13,24], [-23,-12]\n\nNow, at a future turn T (starting at T=3), the position of a car on a freeway is:\n\n  For a right-moving car: \n      new_tail = τ + s*(T-3)\n      new_head = h + s*(T-3)\n\nWe are concerned only when the player is on that freeway at turn T. At that turn, we check if 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway.\n\nOur plan: we want to go from y=1 to y=9. We can only change by at most 1 per turn. So the minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 8 (from y=1 to y=9: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe must check for each freeway and each turn whether if we are on that freeway at that turn, we are safe (i.e., 0 is not in any car span on that freeway at that turn).\n\nWe are going to simulate the car movements and then plan a path.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at each turn for each freeway. Since the cars move continuously, we only care when the car spans cover 0. But note: the cars are moving and we are stepping by turns.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway and for each turn T (from 3 onwards) the car spans.\n\nFirst, note that the cars on freeways 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 are moving very fast (speed 36 and 24 respectively) and are currently at positions that are positive. Since they are moving right, they will leave the 0 position quickly and never come back? Actually, they started at positive and are moving to more positive. So the only danger is if at the current turn (T=3) or very soon they might cover 0? Let's check:\n\nFreeway 1 at T=3: [25,60] -> 0 is not in [25,60]. And since the car is moving right, the entire span is moving right. So 0 will never be covered on freeway 1? Similarly for freeway 2 and 3.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway 4? At T=3: [1,24]. Is 0 in [1,24]? No, because 1 to 24 are all positive and 0 is less than 1. And the car is moving right, so the span becomes [1+24*(T-3), 24+24*(T-3)] which is always positive and increasing. So 0 will never be in that span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 and 6: same as 4.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have three cars each. Let's check:\n\nFreeway 7 at T=3:\n  Car1: [49,60] -> 0 not in there.\n  Car2: [13,24] -> 0 not in there.\n  Car3: [-23,-12] -> 0 is not in [-23,-12]? -23 to -12: 0 is greater than -12? Actually, 0 is not in [-23,-12] because the interval is negative. But note: the car is moving right. So at time T, the positions are:\n\n  Car3: tail = -23 + 4*(T-3), head = -12 + 4*(T-3)\n\n  When will 0 be in this span?\n      -23 + 4*(T-3) <= 0 <= -12 + 4*(T-3)\n\n  Solve:\n      -23 + 4*(T-3) <= 0  => 4*(T-3) <= 23 => T-3 <= 5.75 => T <= 8.75 -> so T<=8 (since integer)\n      and 0 <= -12 + 4*(T-3) => 4*(T-3) >= 12 => T-3>=3 => T>=6.\n\n  So for T in [6,8] (T=6,7,8) the car3 on freeway 7 will have 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, the same car3 will have 0 in its span at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, what about the other cars on freeway 7 and 8?\n\n  Car1: [49,60] at T=3 -> becomes [49+4*(T-3), 60+4*(T-3)] -> always positive and increasing. 0 never in it.\n\n  Car2: [13,24] at T=3 -> becomes [13+4*(T-3), 24+4*(T-3)] -> always positive and increasing. 0 never in it.\n\nSo the only danger is on freeway 7 and 8 at turns 6,7,8: because of car3.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 3 at y=1. We need to pass through freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 to get to 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway 7 or 8 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nHow can we do that?\n\nWe can either:\n  a) Be on freeway 7 or 8 at a turn not in {6,7,8}. \n  b) Or skip freeway 7 or 8 entirely? But we have to go through freeway 7 to get to 8 and then 9.\n\nActually, we must traverse freeway 7 and then freeway 8. So we have to be on freeway 7 at some turn and freeway 8 at the next turn (or maybe wait?).\n\nWe start at turn 3 at y=1.\n\nWe can control our vertical movement. We can go up, down, or stay.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns. So we want to go up as much as possible. But we must avoid the dangerous times.\n\nThe dangerous times for freeway 7 and 8 are turns 6,7,8.\n\nWe are at turn 3. We have 3 turns (turn 3,4,5) to get to freeway 7? Actually, we have to go through freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 3:\n\nWe can go:\n\nTurn 3: at y=1 -> safe? freeway 1: we computed that there is no car covering 0 at turn 3 (since [25,60] doesn't cover 0). So safe.\n\nThen we can choose an action: U (to go to y=2 at turn4), D (to y=0 at turn4) or S (stay at y=1 at turn4).\n\nBut we want to go up. However, we have to avoid freeway7 and 8 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nWhat if we go as fast as possible:\n\nTurn3: U -> y=2 at turn4\nTurn4: U -> y=3 at turn5\nTurn5: U -> y=4 at turn6\nTurn6: U -> y=5 at turn7\nTurn7: U -> y=6 at turn8\nTurn8: U -> y=7 at turn9\nTurn9: U -> y=8 at turn10\nTurn10: U -> y=9 at turn11 -> done in 8 moves? (from turn3 to turn10: 8 actions? Actually, we start at turn3 and do actions at turn3,4,...,10 -> 8 actions, and then at turn11 we are at y=9? But wait, we are at turn3 at y=1. After one action (at turn3) we are at turn4 at y=2. So to get to y=9 we need 8 moves? (because 9-1=8).\n\nBut note: at turn6 we are at y=5 (freeway5) -> safe? freeway5: only one car [1,24] at turn3, then at turn6: \n  freeway5: car moves: tail = 1 + 24*(6-3) = 1+72=73, head=24+72=96 -> [73,96] -> 0 not in it -> safe.\n\nAt turn7: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5: [1+24*(7-3)=1+96=97, 24+96=120] -> safe.\n\nAt turn8: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: at turn8, we are on freeway7 at turn8 -> which is dangerous! Because car3 on freeway7 at turn8: \n  tail = -23 + 4*(8-3) = -23+20 = -3\n  head = -12+20 = 8\n  So the span is [-3,8] -> which includes 0! So we crash.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway7 at turn8.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on freeway7 at turn6 or turn7, we also crash. So we must avoid freeway7 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turns6,7,8 is dangerous.\n\nSo in the above plan, at turn8 we are at freeway7 and that is dangerous.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nHow about we slow down? We can stay at some freeway for a few turns to avoid being on freeway7 or 8 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nWe have to be on freeway7 at a turn T where T<6 or T>8. Similarly for freeway8.\n\nBut note: we are at turn3 at y=1. We can only move one step per turn. So the earliest we can be at freeway7 is:\n\n  Turn3: y=1\n  Turn4: y=2\n  Turn5: y=3\n  Turn6: y=4\n  Turn7: y=5\n  Turn8: y=6\n  Turn9: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn9 -> which is after 8? turn9>8 -> safe? \n      Check freeway7 at turn9: car3: tail = -23+4*(9-3)= -23+24=1, head=-12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go:\n  Turn10: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn10: \n      car3: tail = -23+4*(10-3)= -23+28=5, head=-12+28=16 -> [5,16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Turn11: y=9 -> done.\n\nBut that took 8 moves? Actually, from turn3 to turn11: we did 8 actions? Let's count:\n\n  Turn3: action to go to y=2 at turn4 -> action at turn3\n  Turn4: to y=3 at turn5 -> action at turn4\n  Turn5: to y=4 at turn6 -> action at turn5\n  Turn6: to y=5 at turn7 -> action at turn6\n  Turn7: to y=6 at turn8 -> action at turn7\n  Turn8: to y=7 at turn9 -> action at turn8\n  Turn9: to y=8 at turn10 -> action at turn9\n  Turn10: to y=9 at turn11 -> action at turn10\n\nSo 8 actions? But wait, we started at y=1 at turn3. After 8 actions we are at y=9 at turn11. However, we passed freeway7 at turn9 (which is safe) and freeway8 at turn10 (safe). \n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nMinimal steps: 8 steps (to go up 8 units). But we had to avoid the danger at turns 6,7,8. We did that by being at freeway7 at turn9 (which is after 8). But we are using 8 actions and ending at turn11.\n\nCan we do it in less than 8 moves? No, because we have to go from y=1 to y=9: 8 steps.\n\nBut wait: we started at turn3 at y=1. The next moves are at turn4,5,..., up to turn10 (if we do 8 moves). So we end at turn11.\n\nBut is there a way to be at freeway7 before turn6? \n\nWe are at turn3 at y=1. The earliest we can be at freeway7:\n\n  We must go up 6 steps: from y=1 to y=7: that takes 6 moves? \n      Turn3: U -> y=2 at turn4\n      Turn4: U -> y=3 at turn5\n      Turn5: U -> y=4 at turn6\n      Turn6: U -> y=5 at turn7\n      Turn7: U -> y=6 at turn8\n      Turn8: U -> y=7 at turn9 -> same as above.\n\nBut wait, we can try to go faster? We are limited to one step per turn. So we cannot skip freeways.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a detour? But going down would make the path longer.\n\nSo minimal steps is 8.\n\nBut wait, in the above plan we avoided the danger by being at freeway7 at turn9 (which is safe). However, we also need to check the other freeways we pass through.\n\nWe must check every freeway we are on at each turn:\n\nTurn3: y=1 (freeway1) -> at turn3: freeway1 has car [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nTurn4: y=2 (freeway2) -> at turn4: freeway2 car: [25+36*(4-3)=25+36=61, 60+36=96] -> [61,96] -> safe.\nTurn5: y=3 (freeway3) -> at turn5: [25+36*(5-3)=25+72=97, 60+72=132] -> safe.\nTurn6: y=4 (freeway4) -> at turn6: freeway4 car: [1+24*(6-3)=1+72=73, 24+72=96] -> safe.\nTurn7: y=5 (freeway5) -> at turn7: [1+24*(7-3)=1+96=97, 24+96=120] -> safe.\nTurn8: y=6 (freeway6) -> at turn8: [1+24*(8-3)=1+120=121, 24+120=144] -> safe.\nTurn9: y=7 (freeway7) -> at turn9: \n      car1: [49+4*(9-3)=49+24=73, 60+24=84] -> safe.\n      car2: [13+4*6=13+24=37, 24+24=48] -> safe.\n      car3: [-23+4*6=-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nTurn10: y=8 (freeway8) -> at turn10: \n      car3: [-23+4*(10-3)= -23+28=5, -12+28=16] -> [5,16] -> safe.\n\nThen turn10: we move to y=9 at turn11, which is safe (no freeway at y=9).\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: we are doing 8 moves: actions at turn3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. What is H? The sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions. And then we are at (0,9) at turn t1 + H? \n\nWe start at turn t1=3. After H actions, we will be at turn t1 + H. And we want to be at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nIn our plan, we do 8 actions: at turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Then at turn 3+8 = 11, we are at (0,9). So H=8.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we have H actions. So H=8.\n\nBut can we do it faster? We must move 8 steps up. So we cannot do it in less than 8 actions. Therefore, 8 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up faster? We can only move one per turn. So 8 is the minimum.\n\nBut note: we could go down to y=0 and then go up? That would take more than 8. So no.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\n\nBut wait, we are at y=1 at turn3. After the first U (at turn3) we are at y=2 at turn4. Then U at turn4 to y=3 at turn5, and so on until at turn10 we do the 8th U and go to y=9 at turn11.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\n\nBut note: the problem says the current turn is t1=3, and we start at (0,1). We are to provide actions for turns starting at t1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t1 (3): U\nTurn t1+1 (4): U\n...\nTurn t1+7 (10): U\n\nBut we have 8 actions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t from 0 to H-1: that means we have H actions. And H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm: at turn3 (t1) we do the first action. Then we do an action at each subsequent turn until we've done 8 actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, we must avoid being on freeway7 and 8 at turns 6,7,8. In this plan we are not on freeway7 until turn9 and freeway8 until turn10. So we avoided the danger.\n\nBut what if we try to go even faster? We can't.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider a path that goes down to avoid the danger? But that would take more steps.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=8.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 8 steps without the danger? We already did: we are not on the dangerous freeways at the dangerous times.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway 8? We are on freeway8 at turn10. Is that safe? We computed: at turn10, freeway8 car3: [5,16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut are there any other dangers? We checked all the freeways we passed.\n\nBut wait, freeway6 at turn8: we are at freeway6 at turn8? \n\nIn our plan:\n  At turn8: we are at y=6? \n      How? \n          turn3: start at y=1\n          turn3: U -> at turn4: y=2\n          turn4: U -> turn5: y=3\n          turn5: U -> turn6: y=4\n          turn6: U -> turn7: y=5\n          turn7: U -> turn8: y=6 -> so freeway6.\n\nAt turn8: freeway6: the car is [1+24*(8-3)=1+120=121, 24+120=144] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway7 at turn9: safe as computed.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut note: what if we try to be at freeway7 earlier? We can't because we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we could stay at some freeway for a turn to avoid the danger? But that would take more than 8 steps.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8, and the sequence is 8 U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nWe have H=8 and the sequence is U repeated 8 times.\n\nBut let me write it in the required format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the current turn is t1=3, and we are to list actions for t1, t1+1, ... until t1+H-1.\n\nH=8, so we list from t1 to t1+7.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". \n\nt starts at 0: so t=0 -> a_{t1+0} = a_3\nt=1 -> a_4\n...\nt=7 -> a_{10}\n\nSo that's 8 actions.\n\nTherefore, the above is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We have checked that at each turn we are on a freeway, the freeway at that turn does not have a car covering 0.\n\nBut one more thing: at the turn when we are at y=9, we are not on a freeway (since freeways are 1 to 8), so no collision check. And we are at (0,9) at the end.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut wait: what if we can do it in 7 moves? That would require going up 8 steps in 7 moves? That's impossible because we can only move one per turn. So 8 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway7 at turn9: \n  car3: tail = -23 + 4*(9-3) = -23+24=1, head=-12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn10: [5,16] -> safe.\n\nAnd all others are safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) required to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t_1 = 3\\) to \\(t_1 + 7 = 10\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeways 1–6**: All cars are moving right with high speeds (36 or 24). Their spans at any turn \\(T \\geq 3\\) are positive and increasing, so 0 is never in their spans. Thus, no collision occurs on these freeways.\n- **Freeway 7**: The car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 4)\\) has a span that covers 0 at turns 6, 7, and 8. The player is on freeway 7 at turn 9, where the span is \\([-23 + 4 \\times (9 - 3), -12 + 4 \\times (9 - 3)] = [1, 12]\\), which does not contain 0. The other cars on freeway 7 (spans \\([49, 60]\\) and \\([13, 24]\\) at \\(T = 3\\)) move right and never cover 0.\n- **Freeway 8**: Similarly, the car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 4)\\) covers 0 at turns 6, 7, and 8. The player is on freeway 8 at turn 10, where the span is \\([-23 + 4 \\times (10 - 3), -12 + 4 \\times (10 - 3)] = [5, 16]\\), which does not contain 0. Other cars on freeway 8 never cover 0.\n- **Player Path**:\n  - Turn 3: Position \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1, safe).\n  - Turn 4: Position \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2, safe).\n  - Turn 5: Position \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3, safe).\n  - Turn 6: Position \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4, safe).\n  - Turn 7: Position \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5, safe).\n  - Turn 8: Position \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6, safe).\n  - Turn 9: Position \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7, safe at \\(T = 9\\)).\n  - Turn 10: Position \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8, safe at \\(T = 10\\)).\n  - Turn 11: Position \\((0, 9)\\) (no freeway, goal reached).\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3\\) to \\(10\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I have the positions and movements of the cars on each freeway.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Also, when moving, you're not on the new row until the next turn, so if you move at turn T, you're still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and you move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there, so once we're at y=9, we're safe.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so no cars. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nNow, let's list out the car states at turn t_1=4.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it says for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nI think head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail? But here h=-48, τ=-83, and since -48 > -83, yes, head is at -48, tail at -83.\n\nSo at time T, position: since moving right, x increases.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s (T - t_1), h + s (T - t_1)] = [-83 + 36*(T-4), -48 + 36*(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut collision depends on whether 0 is in this span at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here seem to be right-moving, except I need to check.\n\nLooking at freeway 7 and 8, they have multiple cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, right, s=36, h=-48, τ=-83\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48, -83, right, 36) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-48, -83, right, 36) — all the same?\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 25, right, 24) — h=48, τ=25, but if right-moving, head should be larger, 48>25, yes.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, (48,25,right,24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (48,25,right,24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nNow, for each, I need the span at time T.\n\nt_1 = 4, so for any turn T, Δt = T - 4.\n\nLet δ = T - 4, so at turn T=4 + δ.\n\nThen for a car, span at T: [τ + s * δ, h + s * δ] for right-moving.\n\nCollision if player is on freeway k at turn T, and for that k, there is a car with 0 in [τ + s δ, h + s δ]\n\nSince multiple cars, if any car on that row has 0 in span.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at turn t=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=2 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn t=4, player is on y=2, so we need to check if there is a collision at turn t=4 on freeway 2.\n\nFor freeway 2 at T=4, δ=0.\n\nCars: one car, span [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-83, -48]\n\nIs 0 in [-83, -48]? -83 to -48, all negative, 0 not in, so no collision at start.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, we need to move up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be since we need to go from y=2 to y=9, which is 7 steps up, but we can move diagonally? No, only vertical moves, U, D, S.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so to go from 2 to 9, we need at least 7 Up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so we need to see when they are at x=0.\n\nx=0 is the player's x-position, fixed.\n\nFor each freeway, we need to find times when a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find T such that for some car on k, 0 in [τ + s δ, h + s δ] with δ = T - 4.\n\nSince s and τ, h given.\n\nAlso, since the player moves, we need to ensure that when on a freeway at turn T, no car on that freeway has 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the times when it is dangerous, i.e., when some car is at x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: car with τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [-83 + 36δ, -48 + 36δ]\n\nSet 0 in this interval: min ≤ 0 ≤ max\n\nSince it's a interval, 0 ∈ [A,B] iff A ≤ 0 ≤ B.\n\nA = -83 + 36δ, B = -48 + 36δ\n\nSo -83 + 36δ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36δ\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nFirst, -83 + 36δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36δ ≤ 83 ⇒ δ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -48 + 36δ ⇒ 48 ≤ 36δ ⇒ δ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo δ between 1.333 and 2.305, since δ integer? Turns are discrete, so δ integer, T integer.\n\nδ = T - 4, T turn number, integer.\n\nSo δ integer.\n\nδ ≥ ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nδ ≤ floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2? Let's calculate.\n\n48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so 0 ≤ -48 + 36δ ⇒ 36δ ≥ 48 ⇒ δ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3, since δ integer, δ ≥ 2? 36*1 = 36 < 48, so 0 ≤ -48 + 36δ only if 36δ ≥ 48, δ ≥ 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so for δ=2, -48+72=24>0, yes; δ=1, -48+36=-12<0, not ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, upper: -83 + 36δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36δ ≤ 83 ⇒ δ ≤ 83/36≈2.305, so δ ≤ 2 since integer.\n\nδ=2: -83 + 72 = -11 ≤0, yes; δ=3: -83+108=25>0, not ≤0.\n\nNow, 0 ≤ B: for δ=2, B= -48+72=24>0, good.\n\nFor δ=1: A= -83+36= -47 ≤0, but B= -48+36= -12 <0, so 0 not ≤ B, so 0 not in [-47,-12], all negative.\n\nSimilarly, δ=3: A= -83+108=25>0, B= -48+108=60>0, 0 not ≤ A, so not in [25,60].\n\nSo only for δ=2, T=4+2=6, at T=6, span [ -83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], and 0 is between -11 and 24, yes, 0 ∈ [-11,24].\n\n-11 ≤ 0 ≤ 24, true.\n\nSo on freeway 1, dangerous at T=6.\n\nOnly at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since identical car, so also dangerous only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3: same, dangerous at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (48,25,right,24)\n\nh=48, τ=25, s=24\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 24δ, 48 + 24δ] for right-moving.\n\n0 in [25+24δ, 48+24δ]\n\nSince both positive for δ≥0, min is 25+24δ >0 for all δ≥0, so 0 never in this interval, because left end is at least 25>0.\n\nSo freeway 4 is always safe, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) — head h=-48, tail τ=-59? -48 > -59, so head at -48, tail at -59? But usually tail should be less for right-moving.\n\nτ=-59, h=-48, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48], moving right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s δ, h + s δ] = [-59 + 4δ, -48 + 4δ]\n\n0 in this: -59 +4δ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +4δ\n\nFirst: -59 +4δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4δ ≤ 59 ⇒ δ ≤ 59/4=14.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +4δ ⇒ 4δ ≥48 ⇒ δ ≥12\n\nSo δ between 12 and 14.75, so δ=13,14,15? δ integer.\n\nδ ≥12, δ≤14.75 so δ=12,13,14\n\nCheck:\n\nδ=12: A= -59+48= -11 ≤0, B= -48+48=0 ≤0? 0 ≤ B: B=0, 0≤0 true, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nYes.\n\nδ=13: A= -59+52= -7 ≤0, B= -48+52=4>0, 0≤4 true.\n\nδ=14: A= -59+56= -3 ≤0, B= -48+56=8>0, 0≤8 true.\n\nδ=15: A= -59+60=1>0, not ≤0, and B= -48+60=12>0, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for first car, dangerous at δ=12,13,14 → T=16,17,18\n\nT=4+δ, so T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (28,17,right,4)\n\nh=28, τ=17, s=4\n\nSpan: [17+4δ, 28+4δ]\n\nBoth positive for δ≥0, min 17>0, so 0 never in, always safe.\n\nThird car: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nh=-8, τ=-19\n\nSpan: [-19 +4δ, -8 +4δ]\n\n0 in: -19+4δ ≤0 ≤ -8+4δ\n\nFirst: -19+4δ ≤0 ⇒ 4δ ≤19 ⇒ δ≤19/4=4.75\n\nSecond: 0≤ -8+4δ ⇒ 4δ≥8 ⇒ δ≥2\n\nSo δ=2,3,4\n\nδ=2: A= -19+8= -11≤0, B= -8+8=0≤0, true, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nδ=3: A= -19+12= -7≤0, B= -8+12=4>0, 0≤4 true\n\nδ=4: A= -19+16= -3≤0, B= -8+16=8>0, 0≤8 true\n\nδ=5: A= -19+20=1>0, not\n\nSo dangerous at δ=2,3,4 → T=6,7,8\n\nNow for freeway 7, dangerous if any car has 0 in span, so:\n\nFrom first car: T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car: never\n\nThird car: T=6,7,8\n\nSo overall, freeway 7 dangerous at T=6,7,8,16,17,18\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since identical cars, so dangerous at same times: T=6,7,8,16,17,18\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous only at T=6\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=6 (since same as y=1)\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=6\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=6,7,8,16,17,18\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=6,7,8,16,17,18\n\ny=7 and y=8 both dangerous at T=6,7,8 and later T=16-18.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, turn t=4.\n\nWe need a sequence of actions to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go up 7 steps, H at least 7, but we might need to delay or something to avoid collisions.\n\nAt turn T=4, player at y=2.\n\nWe need to decide actions for each turn.\n\nSince the dangerous times are only at T=6 for y=1,2,3 and T=6,7,8 for y=7,8.\n\nSpecifically, T=6 is dangerous for y=1,2,3,7,8.\n\nT=7 and 8 dangerous for y=7 and 8 only.\n\nNow, player at T=4, y=2.\n\nIf we go up immediately, let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, to minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at T=6, if we are on y=1,2,3,7, or 8, it is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7 and T=8, if on y=7 or 8, dangerous.\n\nSince we start at y=2 at T=4, and T=6 is soon.\n\nWe can try to be not on those rows at T=6.\n\nList the turns.\n\nLet t be absolute turn, starting from t=4.\n\nAt t=4: y=2, and as we saw, not dangerous at t=4.\n\nAction a_t for t=4,5,6,... until we reach y=9.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\ny_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, we are on row y_t, and we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on row k=y_t, and k is dangerous at t.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=2, not dangerous.\n\nWe choose a_4, then y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\nThen at t=5, we are on y_5, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y_t=9 for some t.\n\nSince we start at y=2, to reach y=9, we need at least 7 up moves.\n\nBut we might have stay or down moves.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=4+H, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nThen after action a_{t_1 + H-1}, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given, y_{t_1} = 2.\n\nAfter t=0 to H-1 actions, we have applied H actions, so at time t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nt_1 = 4, so at time 4+H, y=9.\n\nNow, the turns involved: from t=4 to t=4+H, but collision is checked at each turn from t=4 to t=4+H-1, I think, since at t=4+H, we are at y=9, no freeway.\n\nCollision only when on freeway, so at turns t=4 to t=4+H-1, we are on y_t <=8, freeway, and need to avoid collision.\n\nAt t=4+H, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, minimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, need at least 7 up moves, so H >=7.\n\nIf we go up every turn, we can reach in 7 turns: at t=4, y=2; after U, t=5 y=3; U, t=6 y=4; U, t=7 y=5; U, t=8 y=6; U, t=9 y=7; U, t=10 y=8; U, t=11 y=9.\n\nSo at t=11, y=9.\n\nNow, check for collisions during t=4 to t=10.\n\nt=4: y=2, not dangerous (as earlier)\n\nt=5: y=3, what is dangerous at t=5?\n\nFor y=3, freeway 3, dangerous only at t=6, not at t=5. Since only t=6 dangerous for y=1,2,3.\n\nt=5: δ=1, for freeway 3, at δ=1, span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=5, safe.\n\nt=6: now in this path, at t=6, y=4\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is always safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nBut t=6 is dangerous for y=1,2,3,7,8, but y=4 is safe.\n\nIn this path at t=6, y=4, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt t=9, what is δ? t=9, t_1=4, δ=5.\n\nFor freeway 7, dangerous at T=6,7,8,16,17,18.\n\nT=9 not dangerous.\n\nAt δ=5, for freeway 7:\n\nFirst car: at δ=5, span [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39,-28], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [17+20,28+20]=[37,48], not.\n\nThird car: [-19+20, -8+20]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=10, δ=6.\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7.\n\nFirst car: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], not.\n\nSecond: [17+24,28+24]=[41,52], not.\n\nThird: [-19+24,-8+24]=[5,16], not.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen t=11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this sequence, all safe, and H=7? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=10? t from 4 to 10, that's 7 actions.\n\nt=4: action, to y_5\n\nAfter action at t, position at t+1.\n\nAt turn t=4, position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\nIn the sequence above: a_4=U, y_5=3\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo actions: a_4 to a_10, that's 7 actions: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nH=7, since from t=0 to H-1=6, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for H=7, actions at t=4 to 4+6=10.\n\nAnd y at t=11=9.\n\nIn this case, no collision at any point.\n\nBut at t=6, y=4, which is safe, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y=7, not dangerous time.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 7 turns with all U.\n\nBut is that correct? We need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=4 is freeway 4, which has cars but never at x=0, so safe.\n\ny=7 at t=9, δ=5, not dangerous, as above.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the player starts at y=2, which is freeway 2, and at t=6, freeway 2 is dangerous, but in this path, at t=6, player is on y=4, not y=2, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Since we can do it in 7, minimal should be 7.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it faster? From y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, each U takes one turn, so minimum 7 turns, cannot be faster.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 2, so 7 is minimum.\n\nSo with all U, it works.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=4, action U, to y=3 at t=5\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=6\n\nt=6 is dangerous for y=1,2,3, but y=4 at t=6 is safe.\n\ny=3 at t=5 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen up to y=9.\n\nBut in the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 7 and 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=7, in this path, player is at y=5, which is always safe.\n\nt=8, y=6, safe.\n\nt=9, y=7, freeway 7, but t=9 not dangerous, as δ=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 7 dangerous at T=6,7,8, but T=6,7,8 correspond to δ=2,3,4.\n\nt=6: δ=2\n\nt=7: δ=3\n\nt=8: δ=4\n\nFor freeway 7, dangerous at δ=2,3,4, which is t=6,7,8.\n\nBut in our path, at t=6, player on y=4, not y=7.\n\nt=7, y=5, not y=7.\n\nt=8, y=6, not y=7 or 8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n\nBut the sequence: actions from t=4 to t=10, all U.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1+1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1 = 4 + 6 =10, U\n\nH=7, actions from t=0 to 6 relative, absolute t from 4 to 10.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: turn t_1 + 0 =4, action U\n\nt=1: turn 5, action U\n\nt=2: turn 6, action U\n\nt=3: turn 7, action U\n\nt=4: turn 8, action U\n\nt=5: turn 9, action U\n\nt=6: turn 10, action U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, there are dangerous times later, like t=16,17,18, but we are done by t=11, so no issue.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we are on a dangerous row.\n\nFor example, at t=4: y=2, δ=0, freeway 2, car span [-83,-48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=5: y=3, δ=1, freeway 3, span [-83+36, -48+36]=[-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=6: y=4, freeway 4, span [25+24*2, 48+24*2]? δ=2, t=6, δ=2.\n\nFor freeway 4, at δ=2, [25+48, 48+48]= [73,96], not 0, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5, similar, always safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7, δ=5.\n\nCars: first car span [-59+20, -48+20]=[-39,-28], not 0.\n\nSecond: [17+20,28+20]=[37,48], not.\n\nThird: [-19+20,-8+20]=[1,12], not 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8, δ=6.\n\nFirst car: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], not.\n\nSecond: [17+24,28+24]=[41,52], not.\n\nThird: [-19+24,-8+24]=[5,16], not 0, safe.\n\nThen t=11: y=9, no freeway.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo minimal H=7 with all U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me see if there is any mistake.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we covered.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower to avoid, but no need.\n\nSince y=4,5,6 are always safe, we can stay there, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nSo all U is fine.\n\nBut in the initial thought, at t=6, y=1,2,3 are dangerous, but we are at y=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me check the player position at each turn.\n\nTurn t=4: y=2\n\nAfter a_4=U, y=3 at t=5\n\nAfter a_5=U, y=4 at t=6\n\nAfter a_6=U, y=5 at t=7\n\nAfter a_7=U, y=6 at t=8\n\nAfter a_8=U, y=7 at t=9\n\nAfter a_9=U, y=8 at t=10\n\nAfter a_10=U, y=9 at t=11\n\nActions from t=4 to t=10.\n\nIn terms of the sequence: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\n\nt_1=4, H=7, so t from 0 to 6, actions at turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 all U.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} = U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 3: a_{t_1 + 3} = U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 4: a_{t_1 + 4} = U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5} = U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 6: a_{t_1 + 6} = U }\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince all U, we can write it compactly, but I think we need to list each turn.\n\nThe format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo for each turn.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at t=6,7,8 they are dangerous, but we are not on them at those times, so fine.\n\nAnother thing: the player is at (0,y), and cars are on the freeway, but when moving, if we move at turn T, we are not on the new row until T+1.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nFor example, at turn t=6, if we were to be on y=7, but in our case, we are on y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but impossible, since 7 steps needed.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 2.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Dangerous Times\n- **Freeways 1, 2, and 3**: Each has a single car with initial span \\([-83, -48]\\) at \\(t_1 = 4\\), moving right at speed 36. The car is at x=0 (dangerous) only at turn \\(T = 6\\) (i.e., \\(\\delta = T - 4 = 2\\)).\n- **Freeways 4, 5, and 6**: Each has a car with initial span \\([25, 48]\\) at \\(t_1 = 4\\), moving right at speed 24. Since the span is always positive for \\(T \\geq 4\\), these freeways are always safe (no car at x=0 at any turn).\n- **Freeway 7**: Has three cars:\n  - Car 1: Initial span \\([-59, -48]\\), moving right at speed 4. Dangerous at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\).\n  - Car 2: Initial span \\([17, 28]\\), moving right at speed 4. Always safe (span always positive).\n  - Car 3: Initial span \\([-19, -8]\\), moving right at speed 4. Dangerous at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\).\n  - Thus, freeway 7 is dangerous at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Identical to freeway 7, so dangerous at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\\).\n\nSummary of dangerous times:\n- \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\): Dangerous only at \\(T = 6\\).\n- \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\): Always safe.\n- \\(y = 7, 8\\): Dangerous at \\(T = 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\\).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe player starts at \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 4\\). To reach \\(y = 9\\), at least 7 Up actions are required, as each Up increases \\(y\\) by 1. The direct path with all Up actions is feasible and avoids all dangerous times:\n- At \\(T = 4\\): \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as not dangerous at \\(T = 4\\)).\n- Action U: Move to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 5\\).\n  - \\(T = 5\\), \\(y = 3\\): Safe (freeway 3 dangerous only at \\(T = 6\\)).\n- Action U: Move to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\).\n  - \\(T = 6\\), \\(y = 4\\): Safe (freeway 4 always safe, and \\(y = 4\\) avoids dangerous rows at \\(T = 6\\)).\n- Action U: Move to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 7\\).\n  - \\(T = 7\\), \\(y = 5\\): Safe (freeway 5 always safe, and \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous but player not on it).\n- Action U: Move to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 8\\).\n  - \\(T = 8\\), \\(y = 6\\): Safe (freeway 6 always safe, and \\(y = 7, 8\\) dangerous but player not on them).\n- Action U: Move to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 9\\).\n  - \\(T = 9\\), \\(y = 7\\): Safe (freeway 7 dangerous at \\(T = 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\\); \\(T = 9\\) is safe).\n- Action U: Move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 10\\).\n  - \\(T = 10\\), \\(y = 8\\): Safe (freeway 8 dangerous at \\(T = 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\\); \\(T = 10\\) is safe).\n- Action U: Move to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 11\\).\n  - \\(T = 11\\), \\(y = 9\\): Safe (no freeway).\n\nThis path takes 7 turns (actions from \\(T = 4\\) to \\(T = 10\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 11\\). Since 7 is the minimum possible (due to the 7-step distance), and no collisions occur, it is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Number of turns \\(H = 7\\).\n- Actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 6\\) (i.e., \\(T = 4\\) to \\(T = 10\\)) are all Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: a_{t_1} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: a_{t_1 + 3} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: a_{t_1 + 4} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: a_{t_1 + 6} = U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 5, but since we're starting from turn 5, I'll consider t=0 as the starting point for simplicity, but I have to remember that the turn counter begins at t_1=5.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t_1=5, and I need to compute where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate) is within the car's span at that turn T. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not considered on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T, they are still on y_T, and only check cars on y_T. At turn T+1, they are on y_{T+1}, so check cars on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=9 should be safe.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t_1=5:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head h=-12, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=36. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, -12] at t=5. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so as time increases, the position increases.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nAt T=t_1, it should be [τ, h], so for right-moving, head is larger, tail is smaller? Let's see:\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], but τ is tail, h is head, so if it's moving right, head should be on the right, so τ < h, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h being head, so probably h > τ for left-moving? Let's clarify.\n\nIn left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nFor consistency, I think head h is always the front of the car, so for left-moving, h is leftmost or rightmost? Let's see the span.\n\nIn left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ], and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut in the collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, I think, from the data.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: (-12,-47,right,36) so h=-12, τ=-47, since right-moving, and τ < h? -47 < -12, yes, so tail at -47, head at -12.\n\nAs time increases, for right-moving, position increases: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 36(T-5), -12 + 36(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4,5,6: (72,49,right,24) but h=72, τ=49, τ=49 < h=72, so tail at 49, head at 72? But 49 to 72, moving right, so at T, [49 + 24(T-5), 72 + 24(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-44,-55,right,4), (32,21,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nFor each, since right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nt_1=5.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince the player starts at y=3, and we need to go to y=9, which is above, so probably moving up is better, but we have to avoid cars on y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=3 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,3), which is on x=0, y=3. y=3 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway k, k=1 to 8, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, ..., freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nSo at turn t_1=5, player is on y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nWe need to check if at turn 5, on freeway 3, is there a car such that 0 in span.\n\nFor freeway 3 at t=5: car (-12,-47,right,36), span at t=5: [τ, h] = [-47, -12] for right-moving? From above, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nHere for freeway 3, h=-12, τ=-47, so τ=-47 < h=-12, so span at t=5: [-47, -12]\n\n0 is not between -47 and -12, since -47 to -12 is all negative, 0 not in, so at turn 5, no collision on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, we need to move to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we start from y=3, we need to go up to y=9, which is 6 steps up, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since we need to go up, and y=0 is safe but below.\n\nMinimal turns would be at least 6, if we can go straight up without stopping.\n\nBut there might be cars blocking, so we need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThe player can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we have to go through intermediate rows.\n\nWe need to be on freeways y=4,5,6,7,8 at some points, and avoid being there when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, we need to find times when for a given freeway, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, we are on y_T, so we check cars on y_T for collision at that turn.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe key point is that we are only on one row per turn.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, list the cars and their span over time.\n\nSet t_rel = T - t_1 = T - 5, so time relative to start.\n\nAt relative time t=0, it's turn 5.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, h=-12, τ=-47, s=36, right-moving\n\nSpan at time t_rel: [τ + s * t_rel, h + s * t_rel] = [-47 + 36 t_rel, -12 + 36 t_rel]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 36 t_rel <= 0 <= -12 + 36 t_rel\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, car (-12,-47,right,36), so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, car (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nFreeway 4: car (72,49,right,24), h=72, τ=49, s=24\n\nSpan: [49 + 24 t_rel, 72 + 24 t_rel]\n\n0 in span if 49 + 24 t_rel <= 0 <= 72 + 24 t_rel\n\nBut 49 + 24 t_rel >= 49 >0 for t_rel >=0, so left end is at least 49, which is positive, so 0 cannot be <= 72 + 24 t_rel since both positive, so 0 never in span for freeway 4, similarly for 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 also have same car (72,49,right,24), so all have positive positions, increasing, so x=0 never covered.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-44,-55,right,4) h=-44, τ=-55? Given as (head, tail) = (-44,-55), and right-moving.\n\nτ=-55, h=-44, so τ < h, span at t_rel: [τ + s t_rel, h + s t_rel] = [-55 + 4 t_rel, -44 + 4 t_rel]\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4) h=32, τ=21, span [21 + 4 t_rel, 32 + 4 t_rel]\n\nThird car: (-4,-15,right,4) h=-4, τ=-15, span [-15 + 4 t_rel, -4 + 4 t_rel]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need when 0 is in one of the spans.\n\nBut since freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, for each, we need to check if 0 is in any of the three spans at time t_rel.\n\nFirst, let's find for freeway 1 (and similarly 2,3 since identical): when 0 in span.\n\nSpan: [-47 + 36 t_rel, -12 + 36 t_rel]\n\n0 in if -47 + 36 t_rel <= 0 <= -12 + 36 t_rel\n\nWhich is:\n\n-47 + 36 t_rel <= 0 => 36 t_rel <= 47 => t_rel <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 + 36 t_rel => 12 <= 36 t_rel => t_rel >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333\n\nSo for t_rel between approx 0.333 and 1.305, 0 is in span.\n\nSince t_rel integer? Turns are discrete, so t_rel = 0,1,2,3,...\n\nSo t_rel >= ceil(1/3) and t_rel <= floor(47/36)\n\n1/3≈0.333, ceil(0.333)=1? Ceil is smallest integer greater than or equal.\n\nt_rel must satisfy t_rel >= 12/36 = 1/3, so since t_rel integer, t_rel >= 1\n\nAnd t_rel <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so t_rel <= 1 since 1.305, floor is 1.\n\nt_rel <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so t_rel <=1\n\nt_rel >= 12/36 =1/3≈0.333, so t_rel >=1\n\nThus only at t_rel=1, 0 in span.\n\nFor t_rel=1: lower bound: -47 + 36*1 = -47+36= -11\n\nUpper bound: -12+36=24\n\nSo span [-11,24], 0 is between -11 and 24, yes.\n\nAt t_rel=0: lower -47, upper -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nt_rel=2: lower -47+72=25, upper -12+72=60, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1,2,3, collision at t_rel=1 only, which is turn T= t_1 +1 =6.\n\nt_rel=1, T=5+1=6.\n\nNow freeway 4,5,6: as I thought, span starts at 49+24t_rel >=49>0, so 0 never in, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: span [-55 + 4 t_rel, -44 + 4 t_rel]\n\n0 in if -55 + 4 t_rel <= 0 <= -44 + 4 t_rel\n\nWhich is:\n\n-55 + 4 t_rel <= 0 => 4 t_rel <= 55 => t_rel <= 55/4 = 13.75\n\nAnd 0 <= -44 + 4 t_rel => 44 <= 4 t_rel => t_rel >= 11\n\nSo t_rel >=11 and t_rel <=13.75, so t_rel=11,12,13\n\nCheck:\n\nt_rel=11: lower -55+44= -11, upper -44+44=0, so [-11,0], 0 included? <= and >=, so 0 <=0 is true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly t_rel=12: lower -55+48= -7, upper -44+48=4, so [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt_rel=13: lower -55+52= -3, upper -44+52=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt_rel=14: lower -55+56=1, upper -44+56=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 7: span [21 + 4 t_rel, 32 + 4 t_rel]\n\nBoth >=21>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in.\n\nThird car: span [-15 + 4 t_rel, -4 + 4 t_rel]\n\n0 in if -15 + 4 t_rel <= 0 <= -4 + 4 t_rel\n\n-15 + 4 t_rel <= 0 => 4 t_rel <=15 => t_rel <=15/4=3.75\n\n0 <= -4 + 4 t_rel => 4 <= 4 t_rel => t_rel >=1\n\nSo t_rel >=1 and t_rel <=3.75, so t_rel=1,2,3\n\nt_rel=1: lower -15+4= -11, upper -4+4=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nt_rel=2: lower -15+8= -7, upper -4+8=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt_rel=3: lower -15+12= -3, upper -4+12=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt_rel=4: lower -15+16=1, upper -4+16=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow for freeway 7, collision if any of the three cars have 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: at t_rel=11,12,13\n\nSecond car: never\n\nThird car: at t_rel=1,2,3\n\nSo overall for freeway 7, collision at t_rel=1,2,3 (from third car) and t_rel=11,12,13 (from first car)\n\nt_rel=1,2,3 and 11,12,13.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as 7.\n\nNow, freeway 4,5,6 always safe.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 only collision at t_rel=1, i.e., turn 6.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at t_rel=0 (turn 5).\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways we need to worry about are y=4,5,6,7,8 since y=3 at start, and y=9 safe.\n\ny=3 is freeway, but at t_rel=0, no collision, as we saw.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=3, we need to increase y by 6, so minimum 6 turns if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait or move down to avoid bad times.\n\nSince we start at turn 5 (t_rel=0), and we need to be on each row at certain times.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t_1: let k = t_rel, so at k=0, turn 5, y=3.\n\nWe need to find actions for k=0 to H-1, such that at some k, y=9.\n\ny_k at turn k.\n\ny_{k} depends on previous actions.\n\nStart at k=0, y=3.\n\nAction a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, but since t_1=5, and t from 0, so turn 5,6,7,... with actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be turn t_1: a_{t_1}, turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll use k from 0.\n\nAt each step, we choose action U, D, or S, which sets y_{k+1} = y_k + delta, with delta = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nAnd y must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision at turn k (which is turn 5+k) if y_k is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span at that turn.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor freeway 1,2,3: collision only at k=1 (turn 6)\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: collision at k=1,2,3 and k=11,12,13\n\nBut k=11,12,13 are far in the future, since we want minimal H, probably we can reach before k=11, so we can ignore k=11,12,13 for now.\n\nSimilarly, k=1,2,3 are early.\n\nNow, we start at k=0, y=3.\n\nAt k=0, y=3, which is freeway 3. Freeway 3 has collision only at k=1, not at k=0, so safe.\n\nWe need to go up.\n\nIf we go up at k=0, to y=4 at k=1.\n\nBut at k=1, if we are on y=4, which is freeway 4. Freeway 4 is always safe, so no collision.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is safe always.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 and 6 safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 are freeway 7 and 8, which have collision at k=1,2,3.\n\nk=1 is turn 6.\n\nNow, let's see the path.\n\nWe need to be on y=9 at some k.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we start from y=3, we can go up directly if possible.\n\nBut we have to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4,5,6 are always safe, so we can be on them at any time.\n\ny=7 and 8 have danger at k=1,2,3.\n\nk=1,2,3 correspond to turns 6,7,8.\n\nSince we start at k=0, turn 5, y=3.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nAt k=0 (turn 5): y=3, action U, then at k=1 (turn 6): y=4\n\nAt k=1, y=4, which is freeway 4, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at k=2 (turn 7)\n\nAt k=2, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at k=3 (turn 8)\n\nAt k=3, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at k=4 (turn 9)\n\nAt k=4, y=7, which is freeway 7. Now, at k=4, is there collision on freeway 7?\n\nFrom above, freeway 7 has collision at k=1,2,3 and 11,12,13.\n\nk=4 is not in {1,2,3}, and 11-13 are later, so at k=4, no collision for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, action U to y=8 at k=5 (turn 10)\n\nAt k=5, y=8, freeway 8. Collision at k=1,2,3,11,12,13, not k=5, so safe.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at k=6 (turn 11)\n\nAt k=6, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached.\n\nSo in 6 turns: from k=0 to k=5 actions, reaching y=9 at k=6? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn k=0 (turn 5): start y=3, after action, y_{k+1} is set.\n\nDefine: at the beginning of turn k, position is y_k.\n\nAfter action a_k, y_{k+1} = y_k + delta.\n\nThen at turn k, we are at y_k, and we check collision based on y_k and the cars at turn k.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt turn k=0 (turn 5): y=3, action U, so y_{1} = 4\n\nBut at turn k=0, we are at y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn k=1 (turn 6): y=4, now we are at y=4, check collision: freeway 4 always safe, so no collision. Action U, set y_{2} =5\n\nAt turn k=2 (turn 7): y=5, freeway 5 safe, action U, y_{3}=6\n\nAt turn k=3 (turn 8): y=6, freeway 6 safe, action U, y_{4}=7\n\nAt turn k=4 (turn 9): y=7, freeway 7. At k=4, is there car at x=0? From above, freeway 7 collision at k=1,2,3,11,12,13. k=4 not in, so safe. Action U, y_{5}=8\n\nAt turn k=5 (turn 10): y=8, freeway 8. Collision at k=1,2,3,11,12,13, not k=5, so safe. Action U, y_{6}=9\n\nAt turn k=6 (turn 11): y=9, not freeway, safe, and we have reached.\n\nNow, the last action is at k=5, which sets y to 9 at k=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which happens after the action.\n\nIn terms of turns, we started at turn 5, and after H actions, we are at turn 5+H with y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions from turn 5 to turn 10, that's 6 actions: k=0 to 5.\n\nTurn 5: action\n\nTurn 6: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: action\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t_1 to t_1+H-1, we have actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"after H actions, at turn t_1+H, position should be (0,9)\".\n\nIn the dynamics: after action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position, take action, move to position at turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn T, then we must have taken actions up to turn T-1.\n\nIn this case, we start at turn t_1=5, position (0,3).\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn T.\n\nThen we need actions from turn 5 to turn T-1.\n\nThe number of actions H = T - t_1 = T - 5.\n\nAnd sequence from a_5 to a_{T-1}.\n\nThen at turn T, position (0,9).\n\nIn my earlier plan, at turn 11, y=9, so T=11, H = T - 5 = 6 actions from turn 5 to 10.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 5: a5, turn 6: a6, ..., turn 10: a10.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 11.\n\nIn the actions, all U, and no collision.\n\nBut in the path, when we were on y=7 at turn 9 (k=4), and y=8 at turn 10 (k=5), both safe, as k=4 and 5 not in collision times.\n\nBut is there any issue with freeway 7 and 8 at k=4 and 5?\n\nFreeway 7 at k=4: t_rel=4, for first car, span [-55+16, -44+16] = [-39, -28], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [21+16,32+16]=[37,48], positive.\n\nThird car: [-15+16, -4+16]=[1,12], positive, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly at k=5: first car [-55+20,-44+20]=[-35,-24], neg; second [41,52]; third [-15+20,-4+20]=[5,16], all not contain 0.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nAnd freeways 4,5,6 always safe.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3 only collision at k=1, but we were on y=4 at k=1, not on y=1,2,3.\n\nAt k=1, we were on y=4, which is fine.\n\nSo this path seems collision-free and takes 6 turns.\n\nBut is it minimal? 6 is the minimum possible since we need to gain 6 in y, each step at most +1.\n\nSo H=6 should be achievable.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 3 at start.\n\nAt turn 5 (k=0), we are on y=3, freeway 3, car span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen we left immediately.\n\nBut in the sequence, we go up to y=4 at next turn.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, collision at k=1,2,3, but we are on y=7 at k=4, which is after, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no need to go through danger times.\n\nPerhaps we could go faster, but 6 is min.\n\nBut the player could stay or move down, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nSo minimal H=6 with all U actions.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1 =5: action U\n\nThen at turn 6, y=4, action U\n\nTurn 7, y=5, action U\n\nTurn 8, y=6, action U\n\nTurn 9, y=7, action U\n\nTurn 10, y=8, action U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be actions from turn 5 to turn 10.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, with H=6.\n\nt=0 to 5, actions a_{5+0} to a_{5+5}, that is a5 to a10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision when moving.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=6 to y=7 at turn 8 (k=3).\n\nAt turn 8 (k=3), we are at y=6, which is freeway 6, safe.\n\nWe take action U, so at turn 9, we are at y=7.\n\nAt turn 9 (k=4), we are at y=7, freeway 7, which we said no collision.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut freeway 7 has collision at k=1,2,3, which are turns 6,7,8.\n\nAt turn 8 (k=3), if we were on y=7, it would be collision, but we were on y=6 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9 (k=4), we are on y=7, but k=4 not collision time.\n\nSo fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we delay, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=6 is possible.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 7 and 8 have cars that might cover at other times, but we saw only k=1,2,3 and 11,12,13.\n\nk=11,12,13 are turn 16,17,18, later, not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's double-check the car on freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 5 (k=0), y=3, span [-47,-12], 0 not in, ok.\n\nAt turn 6 (k=1), if we were on y=3, it would be collision, but we moved to y=4 at turn 6, so at turn 6, we are on y=4, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to write for each turn.\n\nNow, the current turn is t_1=5, so:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=6.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it in fewer? No, because from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 up moves, and no diagonal, so no.\n\nPerhaps if we start by staying or something, but that would only increase H.\n\nSo min H=6.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at k=3, which is turn 8, collision, but we are not on y=7 or 8 at that time.\n\nWe are on y=6 at turn 8.\n\ny=6 at turn 8 is safe.\n\nThen we move up.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut in the freeway 7, third car at k=3: t_rel=3, span [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8], which includes 0, so if on y=7 or 8 at turn 8, collision.\n\nBut we are not.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think the sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Collision Times\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3**: Each has one car with head \\(h = -12\\), tail \\(\\tau = -47\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 36\\).  \n  - Collision occurs only at relative turn \\(k = 1\\) (absolute turn 6), when the span is \\([-11, 24]\\), containing 0.  \n  - Safe at all other turns.\n\n- **Freeways 4, 5, 6**: Each has one car with head \\(h = 72\\), tail \\(\\tau = 49\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 24\\).  \n  - The span starts at \\([49, 72]\\) and increases; 0 is never in the span. Always safe.\n\n- **Freeway 7**: Three cars:  \n  - Car 1: \\(h = -44\\), \\(\\tau = -55\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\). Collision at \\(k = 11, 12, 13\\).  \n  - Car 2: \\(h = 32\\), \\(\\tau = 21\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\). No collision (span always positive).  \n  - Car 3: \\(h = -4\\), \\(\\tau = -15\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\). Collision at \\(k = 1, 2, 3\\).  \n  - Overall, collision at \\(k = 1, 2, 3\\) and \\(k = 11, 12, 13\\).\n\n- **Freeway 8**: Same cars as freeway 7; collision at \\(k = 1, 2, 3\\) and \\(k = 11, 12, 13\\).\n\nSince the goal is to minimize \\(H\\), turns beyond \\(k = 10\\) (absolute turn 15) are not considered, as \\(H = 6\\) is achievable before then. Thus, only collision times \\(k = 1, 2, 3\\) for freeways 7 and 8 are relevant.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in \\(H = 6\\) Turns\n- Start at turn 5 (\\(k = 0\\)), position (0, 3). Freeway 3 is safe at \\(k = 0\\) (span \\([-47, -12]\\), 0 not in range).  \n- Move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 after 6 actions.  \n- The path avoids all collision times:  \n  - At turn 6 (\\(k = 1\\)): On \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, always safe).  \n  - At turn 7 (\\(k = 2\\)): On \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, always safe).  \n  - At turn 8 (\\(k = 3\\)): On \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, always safe).  \n  - At turn 9 (\\(k = 4\\)): On \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe as \\(k = 4\\) not a collision time).  \n  - At turn 10 (\\(k = 5\\)): On \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe as \\(k = 5\\) not a collision time).  \n- At turn 11, position (0, 9), which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 6\\) turns, the minimum possible since \\(y\\) must increase by 6 units, requiring at least 6 up moves.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 5: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6)  \n- Turn 6: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7)  \n- Turn 7: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8)  \n- Turn 8: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9)  \n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10)  \n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11)\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 4) at turn t_1 = 6. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8) and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, if the player moves to a new row at turn T, they are not on that new row until the next turn, so they only check for cars on the current row at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans move over time based on their direction and speed. For right-moving cars, the span shifts right by s per turn, and for left-moving, it shifts left. But in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the direction given. Let me check:\n\n- Freeways 1 to 3: all right, speed 36\n\n- Freeways 4 to 6: all right, speed 24\n\n- Freeway 7: three cars, all right, speed 4\n\n- Freeway 8: three cars, all right, speed 4\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so the spans will be shifting to the right as time increases.\n\nThe car state is given at turn t_1 = 6. So for any future turn T, the span of a car can be calculated as:\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]? Let's see the rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36). So at t_1=6, head h=24, tail τ=-11? The notation is (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which would be [-11, 24] in this case, since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] = [-11 + 36*(T-6), 24 + 36*(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] at time T.\n\nSince the player moves at the end of the turn, I think. Let's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, action a_t is taken, which affects y_{t+1}. So position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt the start of turn t, position is y_t. Then action a_t is chosen, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at row y_T. If y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to check if for any car on that row, 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nIf y_T is 0 or 9, no collision since no freeway.\n\n0 and 9 are safe, I assume, as boundaries.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at t=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H should be at least the vertical distance: from y=4 to y=9, that's 5 steps up, so minimum 5 turns if we only go up. But we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut we need to check the car positions over time to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their span evolution.\n\nt_1 = 6.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (h, τ, d, s) = (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nSpan at time t: [τ + s(t - 6), h + s(t - 6)] = [-11 + 36(t-6), 24 + 36(t-6)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)  [h=-48, τ=-71? That seems odd, head should be greater than tail for right-moving?]\n\nLet's see the direction: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nBut here for freeway 4: h=-48, τ=-71, and direction right. Since τ=-71, h=-48, and right-moving, so at t_1=6, span is [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? But then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-71 + 24(T-6), -48 + 24(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars:\n\nCar1: (-40, -51, right, 4) → span at t: [-51 + 4(t-6), -40 + 4(t-6)]\n\nCar2: (36, 25, right, 4) → [25 + 4(t-6), 36 + 4(t-6)]? Head h=36, tail τ=25? But for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, so if τ=25, h=36, that's fine.\n\nIn the notation, it's given as (head, tail, ...), so for car2 on freeway 7: head=36, tail=25? But 36 > 25, so [25,36] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, car3: (0, -11, right, 4) → head=0, tail=-11, so [-11,0] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same as freeway 7: cars (-40,-51,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)\n\nNow, for collision, we care about when 0 is in the span for a given row and time.\n\nThat is, for a freeway k, at time t, if there is a car where 0 ∈ [τ_i + s_i(t-6), h_i + s_i(t-6)] for some car i on row k.\n\nSince the spans are intervals, 0 is in [a,b] if a <= 0 <= b.\n\nWe need to find for each row, at which times it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut since the player moves vertically, and the cars are horizontal, the only point we care about is x=0 for collision.\n\nSo for each freeway row, we can find the times when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThen, when the player is on that row at that time, collision occurs.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, player starts at t=6, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the quickest way is to go up as much as possible, but avoiding rows when they are occupied at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the set of times when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, the span is moving right, so for each car, there is a time interval when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a given car with span [τ + s(t-6), h + s(t-6)] at time t.\n\nSet L(t) = τ + s(t-6)\n\nU(t) = h + s(t-6)\n\nThen 0 is in [L(t), U(t)] if L(t) <= 0 <= U(t)\n\nWhich is τ + s(t-6) <= 0 and 0 <= h + s(t-6)\n\nSo τ + s(t-6) <= 0 => s(t-6) <= -τ => t-6 <= -τ/s\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s(t-6) => s(t-6) >= -h => t-6 >= -h/s\n\nSo the time when 0 is covered is from t such that t-6 >= ceil( -h/s ) to t-6 <= floor( -τ/s ), but since it's continuous, we need to be careful with inequalities.\n\nActually, since t is integer (turns), we can find for each car the range of t where L(t) <= 0 <= U(t)\n\nL(t) <= 0 <= U(t)\n\nL(t) = τ + s(t-6) <= 0\n\nU(t) = h + s(t-6) >= 0\n\nSo:\n\nτ + s(t-6) <= 0  => s(t-6) <= -τ  => t-6 <= -τ/s\n\nSince s >0.\n\nSimilarly, h + s(t-6) >= 0 => s(t-6) >= -h => t-6 >= -h/s\n\nSo let t_start = ceil( -h/s ) + 6? Let's see.\n\nt-6 >= -h/s, so t >= 6 + ceil( -h/s )? Not necessarily ceil, because if -h/s is not integer, t-6 needs to be at least the smallest integer greater than or equal to -h/s if inequality is strict.\n\nSince h + s(t-6) >= 0, and s(t-6) >= -h, so t-6 >= ceil( -h/s ) only if we want integer t.\n\nSimilarly for the other inequality.\n\nLet's compute for each car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: car (h=24, τ=-11, s=36)\n\nU(t) = h + s(t-6) = 24 + 36(t-6)\n\nL(t) = τ + s(t-6) = -11 + 36(t-6)\n\n0 in [L(t), U(t)] when L(t) <= 0 <= U(t)\n\nFirst, U(t) >= 0: 24 + 36(t-6) >= 0 => 36(t-6) >= -24 => t-6 >= -24/36 = -2/3 ≈ -0.666\n\nSince t integer, t-6 >= ceil(-0.666) = 0? ceil(-0.666) is 0? ceil is smallest integer greater than or equal.\n\n-0.666, smallest integer >= is 0.\n\nBut t-6 >= -2/3, since t-6 integer, t-6 >= 0? No:\n\nt-6 >= -2/3, and t-6 integer, so t-6 >= 0 because -2/3 > -1, and integers greater than or equal to -2/3 are 0,1,2,... since -1 < -2/3? -1 = -3/3 < -2/3, so integers >= -2/3 are 0,1,2,... \n\nFor example t-6 = -1: -1 < -2/3? -1 = -0.666? -1 < -0.666, yes -1 < -2/3, so U(t) = 24 + 36(-1) = 24 - 36 = -12 <0, not >=0.\n\nt-6=0: U(6) = 24 + 0 =24 >=0, good.\n\nSimilarly, L(t) <=0: -11 +36(t-6) <=0 => 36(t-6) <=11 => t-6 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so t-6 <= 0 since integer? t-6 <= floor(0.305) =0\n\nt-6 <= 11/36 ≈0.305, integer, so t-6 <=0\n\nFor t-6=0: L(6) = -11 +0 = -11 <=0, U(6)=24>=0, so 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nt-6=1: L(7) = -11+36=25 >0, not <=0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at t=6, 0 is covered, only at t=6.\n\nt-6=0: t=6\n\nt-6=1: L(7)= -11+36=25>0, U=24+36=60>0, but L>0, so 0 not in [25,60]\n\nSimilarly, t=5: t-6=-1, L(5)= -11 +36(-1)= -11-36= -47 <=0, U(5)=24-36=-12<0, so U<0, 0 not >= U, so not covered.\n\nSo only at t=6 for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 are identical, so same for them.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (h=-48, τ=-71, s=24)\n\nU(t) = h + s(t-6) = -48 + 24(t-6)\n\nL(t) = τ + s(t-6) = -71 + 24(t-6)\n\n0 in [L(t), U(t)] when L(t) <=0 and U(t) >=0\n\nL(t) <=0: -71 +24(t-6) <=0 => 24(t-6) <=71 => t-6 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so t-6 <= 2\n\nU(t) >=0: -48 +24(t-6) >=0 => 24(t-6) >=48 => t-6 >= 2\n\nSo t-6 >=2 and t-6 <=2, so t-6=2, t=8\n\nAt t=8, L(8)= -71 +24(2)= -71+48= -23 <=0, U(8)= -48 +48=0 >=0, so 0 in [-23,0], yes.\n\nFor other t, not both true.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-40, -51, right, 4) so h=-40, τ=-51, s=4\n\nU(t) = -40 + 4(t-6)\n\nL(t) = -51 + 4(t-6)\n\n0 in [L,U] when L<=0 and U>=0\n\nL<=0: -51 +4(t-6) <=0 => 4(t-6) <=51 => t-6 <= 51/4 = 12.75, so t-6 <=12\n\nU>=0: -40 +4(t-6) >=0 => 4(t-6) >=40 => t-6 >=10\n\nSo t-6 >=10 and t-6 <=12, so t=16,17,18\n\nCheck:\n\nt-6=10: L= -51 +40= -11 <=0, U= -40+40=0 >=0\n\nt-6=11: L= -51+44= -7 <=0, U= -40+44=4 >=0\n\nt-6=12: L= -51+48= -3 <=0, U= -40+48=8 >=0\n\nt-6=9: U= -40+36= -4 <0, not >=0\n\nt-6=13: L= -51+52=1>0, not <=0\n\nSo times t=16,17,18\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (36, 25, right, 4) h=36, τ=25, s=4\n\nU(t) = 36 +4(t-6)\n\nL(t) = 25 +4(t-6)\n\n0 in [L,U] when L<=0<=U\n\nBut L(t) =25 +4(t-6) >=25 >0 for t>=6, so L(t) >0 always, thus 0 cannot be <= L(t) since L>0, so 0 never in [L,U] because L is at least 25 at t=6 and increasing, so min L is 25>0, so 0 < L, not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, U(t) >0 always, but L>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (0, -11, right, 4) h=0, τ=-11, s=4\n\nU(t) = 0 + 4(t-6) = 4(t-6)\n\nL(t) = -11 + 4(t-6)\n\n0 in [L,U] when L<=0<=U\n\nU(t) =4(t-6) >=0, which is true for t>=6\n\nL(t) <=0: -11 +4(t-6) <=0 => 4(t-6) <=11 => t-6 <= 11/4=2.75, so t-6 <=2\n\nThus for t-6 <=2 and t>=6, so t=6,7,8\n\nt-6=0: L= -11 <=0, U=0 >=0? U=0, and 0<=0 is true, so included.\n\nSimilarly t=7: L= -11+4= -7<=0, U=4>=0\n\nt=8: L= -11+8= -3<=0, U=8>=0\n\nt=9: L= -11+12=1>0, not <=0\n\nSo for third car, t=6,7,8\n\nNow for freeway 7, at time t, if any car covers x=0.\n\nAt t=6: first car: U= -40 +0 = -40<0, not >=0, so not covered.\n\nSecond car: L=25>0, not covered.\n\nThird car: covered, as above.\n\nSimilarly, t=7: first car U= -40+4= -36<0, not\n\nSecond not\n\nThird covered\n\nt=8: first U= -40+8= -32<0, no\n\nSecond no\n\nThird covered\n\nNow at t=16,17,18: first car covers, as above.\n\nSecond car never.\n\nThird car only up to t=8.\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied at x=0 when:\n\n- By third car: t=6,7,8\n\n- By first car: t=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 8 has the same cars, so same times: occupied at t=6,7,8 (by third car) and t=16,17,18 (by first car)\n\nNow summarize for each row when it is occupied (collision if player there):\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied only at t=6\n\ny=2: freeway 2, same as y=1, occupied only at t=6\n\ny=3: freeway 3, same, occupied only at t=6\n\ny=4: freeway 4, car, occupied at t=8 (from earlier)\n\nFreeway 4 has one car, occupied only at t=8\n\ny=5: freeway 5, same, occupied only at t=8\n\ny=6: freeway 6, same, occupied only at t=8\n\ny=7: freeway 7, occupied at t=6,7,8 and t=16,17,18\n\ny=8: freeway 8, same as y=7, occupied at t=6,7,8 and t=16,17,18\n\nNow player starts at t=6, y=4.\n\nAt t=6, position y=4.\n\nNow, at t=6, which rows are occupied?\n\ny=1: occupied at t=6, so if player on y=1 at t=6, collision.\n\nSimilarly y=2 and y=3 occupied at t=6.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied only at t=8, not at t=6, so at t=6, y=4 is safe? At t=6, for y=4, we need to check if occupied.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which has car only occupied at t=8, not t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 occupied at t=6.\n\ny=7: at t=6, occupied by third car.\n\nSo at t=6, rows occupied: y=1,2,3,7,8\n\nSafe rows at t=6: y=4,5,6? y=5 is freeway 5, occupied at t=8, not t=6.\n\ny=6 freeway 6, occupied t=8, not t=6.\n\ny=4,5,6 all safe at t=6.\n\nPlayer is at y=4, so safe.\n\nNow we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=4 to y=9, need +5 in y.\n\nEach action U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should use U as much as possible, but avoid being on occupied rows at wrong times.\n\nNow, the occupied times:\n\n- Rows y=1,2,3: dangerous only at t=6\n\n- Rows y=4,5,6: dangerous only at t=8\n\n- Rows y=7,8: dangerous at t=6,7,8 and later t=16,17,18 but since we want minimal H, probably we can reach before t=16, so ignore later times for now.\n\ny=7 and y=8 dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6 is current, we are at y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nStart: t=6, y=4\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to go up, D might not be useful unless to avoid something.\n\nNow, at t=6, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nNext turn, t=7, we choose action a_{t} for t=6, which sets y_{7}.\n\na_t at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars at that time.\n\nNow, we are at turn t=6, y=4.\n\nWe need to choose actions for turns starting from t=6.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 =6, so turns: 6,7,8,... up to some T where y_T=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=6 to t=6+H-1, we have H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t=6+H.\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nStart: at turn t=6, position y_6 =4\n\nAfter action a_6, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nAfter a_7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nCollision at turn k if y_k between 1 and 8 and occupied at that time.\n\nWe need no collision at any turn from t=6 to t=T-1, and y_T=9.\n\ny_T=9, since it's the end, and 9 is safe, no collision.\n\nBut during the path, for each turn k, if y_k in 1-8, must not be occupied.\n\nNow, we want minimal T such that we can reach y_T=9 from y_6=4 with actions.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1, T >= 6 + (9-4) = 11? y_6=4, y_11=9 would be after 5 ups, so turn 11.\n\nBut could be later if we detour.\n\nMinimal T is at least 11.\n\nCan we reach by t=11?\n\ny_11=9.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut we need to check the positions at each turn from 6 to 10, since at turn 11, y=9, safe.\n\nTurns: k from 6 to 10, y_k must be safe if between 1 and 8.\n\nNow, occupied times:\n\nt=6: occupied y=1,2,3,7,8\n\nt=7: occupied? From above, y=7 and y=8 occupied at t=7, because freeway 7 and 8 occupied at t=7 by the third car.\n\nAt t=7, which rows occupied:\n\ny=1: only at t=6, not t=7\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: at t=8, not t=7\n\ny=5: not t=7\n\ny=6: not t=7\n\ny=7: occupied at t=7\n\ny=8: occupied at t=7\n\nSo at t=7, occupied rows: y=7 and y=8\n\nSimilarly, t=8: occupied rows: y=4,5,6 (since freeway 4,5,6 occupied at t=8), and y=7,8 (occupied at t=8)\n\nt=9: no occupied rows? Let's see.\n\nt=9: y=1,2,3: not occupied after t=6\n\ny=4,5,6: only at t=8, not t=9\n\ny=7,8: occupied only at t=6,7,8 and later, not at t=9? At t=9, for y=7, first car not yet, third car not, so no car covers at t=9.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nSo at t=9, no rows occupied, all safe.\n\nSimilarly t=10: same, no occupied.\n\nt=11: same.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nStart t=6, y=4, safe.\n\nNow for t=7, we need y_7.\n\ny_7 depends on action a_6.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y_7 =5\n\nIf S, y_7=4\n\nIf D, y_7=3, but at t=7, y=3 is safe, since only dangerous at t=6.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, occupied rows: y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo y=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=7.\n\nOther rows safe.\n\nNow, we want to go up.\n\nSo at t=6, if we go U, y_7=5\n\ny=5 is safe at t=7.\n\nIf we go S, y_7=4, also safe.\n\nIf D, y_7=3, safe but lower.\n\nNow t=7, position y_7.\n\nThen action a_7, sets y_8.\n\nAt t=8, occupied rows: y=4,5,6 and y=7,8 all occupied.\n\ny=4,5,6 because freeway 4,5,6 occupied at t=8.\n\ny=7,8 occupied as well.\n\nSo at t=8, rows y=4,5,6,7,8 all occupied, thus unsafe.\n\nOnly safe rows at t=8 are y=0,1,2,3,9? But y=1,2,3: at t=8, are they occupied?\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied only at t=6, not t=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 safe at t=8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=0 might not be desirable.\n\nSo at t=8, safe rows: y=0,1,2,3,9\n\nUnsafe: y=4,5,6,7,8\n\nNow, we need to be at one of the safe rows at t=8.\n\nThen for t=9, all rows safe, as above.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nWe are at t=6, y=4.\n\nWe need to choose actions to avoid being on unsafe rows at each turn.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, we must not be on y=4,5,6,7,8, so must be on y=0,1,2,3, or 9.\n\nBut y=9 might be too far.\n\nSince at t=8 we need to be low or high, but high might not be possible.\n\nCurrent y=4 at t=6.\n\nAfter two actions (t=6 and t=7), we set y_8.\n\ny_8 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\ny_6=4\n\nΔy_6 and Δy_7 each in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y_8 between 4-2=2 and 4+2=6.\n\nMin y_8=2, max=6.\n\nBut at t=8, safe y are 0,1,2,3,9.\n\nBut y_8 min 2, max 6, so possible safe values: y=2 or y=3.\n\ny=0,1 not reachable since min y_8=2.\n\ny=9 not reachable since max y_8=6 <9.\n\ny_8 must be 2 or 3 to be safe at t=8.\n\ny=2 or 3.\n\nNow, from y_6=4, to have y_8=2 or 3.\n\ny_8 = 4 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nSet to 2 or 3.\n\nSo if y_8=2, then Δy_6 + Δy_7 = 2-4 = -2, so two downs: D and D.\n\nIf y_8=3, then Δy_6 + Δy_7 = -1, so one down and one stay, or other combinations, but since each step -1,0,1, sum -1: possibilities: D and S, or S and D, or U and D but that would be 0, not -1.\n\nΔy_6 + Δy_7 = -1\n\nOptions: (D,S): -1 + 0 = -1\n\n(S,D): 0 + -1 = -1\n\n(D,U): -1 + 1 =0, not -1\n\n(U,D): same\n\n(S,S):0\n\n(D,D):-2\n\nSo for sum -1: only (D,S) or (S,D) for the actions, meaning one down and one stay in some order.\n\nSimilarly for y_8=2: (D,D)\n\nNow, also, at t=7, we have position y_7, which must be safe.\n\nAt t=7, unsafe rows y=7,8, but since y_7 <= y_6 +1 =5 if U, or less, so y_7 <=5, and y=7,8 not reachable, so y_7 is always safe at t=7, since only y=7,8 unsafe but we can't be there.\n\ny_7: from y_6=4, if U, y_7=5; S, y_7=4; D, y_7=3.\n\nAll of these are not 7 or 8, and at t=7, only y=7,8 occupied, so y_7=3,4,5 all safe.\n\nNo issue at t=7.\n\nSo we only need to ensure that at t=8, y_8=2 or 3.\n\nThen after t=8, since t=9 and later all safe, we can go up directly to y=9.\n\nNow, from y_8=2 or 3, to y=9, need to increase by 6 or 7.\n\nEach U increases by 1, so minimal turns from t=8 to reach y=9.\n\nIf y_8=3, need to go to y=9, delta=6, so after 6 ups, y_{14}=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=8, position y_8.\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, y_{k+1}\n\nWe want y_T=9 for some T.\n\nAfter H actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, position at turn t=6+H.\n\ny_{6+H} =9.\n\nH is number of actions.\n\nStart at turn 6, after 0 actions, y_6.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=6), y_7.\n\nAfter 2 actions (t=6 and t=7), y_8.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn 6+k.\n\nWe want after H actions, y_{6+H} =9.\n\ny_6=4, so need to increase by 5, so minimal H=5, with all U, reaching y_{11}=9.\n\nBut in this case, with the constraints, we might not achieve that because at t=8, we need to be at y=2 or 3, which is lower.\n\nIn the minimal H=5 case, y_8 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nIf all U, y_8 =4 +1 +1=6\n\nBut at t=8, y=6 is occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go U then S, y_8=5, occupied.\n\nS then U, same.\n\nIf we go down, but we want to go up.\n\nSo with H=5, we cannot, because y_8 must be between 4 and 6 if we go up or stay, all occupied at t=8.\n\nIf we go down at some point, but with H=5, to reach y=9 from y=4 in 5 steps, we must go up every step, no down, so y_8=6, occupied.\n\nThus impossible to reach in 5 turns.\n\nMinimal H must be more.\n\nNow, with the constraint, at t=8 we need y_8=2 or 3.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9.\n\ny_8=2 or 3.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to gain 6 or 7 units.\n\nEach U gains 1, so need at least 6 or 7 actions after t=8? Actions from t=8 onwards.\n\nAfter H actions total, position at turn 6+H.\n\ny_{6+H} = y_8 + sum_{t=8}^{6+H-1} Δy_t\n\nSince we start actions from t=6.\n\nSet the actions.\n\nWe have actions at t=6,7,8,..., up to some.\n\ny_k for k from 6.\n\nAt t=8, y_8 must be 2 or 3.\n\nThen from t=8 to when we reach y=9.\n\nThe position at turn t for t>8.\n\nSince no cars after t=8 except later but we can reach before t=16, so all safe.\n\nSo we can go directly up.\n\ny_{t} for t=9,10,... \n\ny_8 = let's say 2 or 3.\n\nThen to reach y=9, minimal time: if y_8=3, we can go U each turn: after one U, y_9=4, then y_10=5, ..., y_12=7, y_13=8, y_14=9.\n\nSo from y_8=3 to y_14=9, that takes 6 actions: a_8 to a_13, so turns from t=8 to t=13, position at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, if y_8=2, y_9=3, ..., y_15=9, so turn 15.\n\nBut y_8=3 is better.\n\nWe need to get to y_8=3 if possible.\n\nNow, back to first two actions.\n\nAt t=6, y_6=4\n\nWe need y_8=2 or 3.\n\nWith actions a_6 and a_7.\n\ny_8 = 4 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nSet to 2 or 3.\n\nOption 1: y_8=2, then Δy_6 + Δy_7 = -2, so both down: a_6=D, a_7=D, then y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6 =4 + (-1)=3, then y_8=3 + (-1)=2? y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7 = (y_6 + Δy_6) + Δy_7\n\nSo for y_8=2: need Δy_6 + Δy_7 = 2-4 = -2, so both D.\n\nThen y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6 =4 + (-1)=3\n\nAt t=7, y=3, which is safe, as we said.\n\nThen y_8=2.\n\nBut y_8=2, then to reach y=9, we need to go up 7 steps: from y=2 to y=9.\n\nAfter a_8: y_9=3, a_9: y_10=4, ..., up to a_14: y_15=9.\n\nSo at turn t=15, y=9.\n\nTotal actions: from t=6 to t=14, that's 9 actions? Turns: actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: 9 actions, position at t=15.\n\nH is number of turns, I think H actions to reach.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1, so H actions, and position at t=t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=6, so at turn 6+H, position.\n\nWe want y_{6+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with y_8=2, then y_{15}=9, so 6+H=15, H=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_8=3, better.\n\ny_8=3: need Δy_6 + Δy_7 = -1.\n\nSo possibilities: a_6=D, a_7=S: then y_7 =4 + (-1)=3, y_8=3 +0=3\n\nOr a_6=S, a_7=D: y_7=4+0=4, y_8=4 + (-1)=3\n\nOr a_6=U, a_7=D: y_7=4+1=5, y_8=5-1=4, but y_8=4, not 3, and at t=8, y=4 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\na_6=D, a_7=U: y_7=4-1=3, y_8=3+1=4, again y_8=4, occupied.\n\nSo only the first two: (D,S) or (S,D) with a_7=D in both cases? Let's list:\n\nTo have sum Δy = -1:\n\nCase 1: a_6=D, a_7=S: Δy_6=-1, Δy_7=0, sum=-1, y_7=4-1=3, y_8=3+0=3\n\nCase 2: a_6=S, a_7=D: Δy_6=0, Δy_7=-1, sum=-1, y_7=4+0=4, y_8=4-1=3\n\nBoth give y_8=3.\n\nIn case 1, y_7=3; case 2, y_7=4.\n\nBoth are safe at t=7.\n\nThen y_8=3, safe at t=8.\n\nNow, from y_8=3, go up to y=9.\n\ny_8=3\n\nThen we can do all U: a_8=U, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\na_11=U, y_12=7\n\na_12=U, y_13=8\n\na_13=U, y_14=9\n\nSo at turn t=14, y=9.\n\nThus H=8 actions: from t=6 to t=13, 8 actions, position at t=14.\n\nIf we did y_8=2, it would take to t=15, worse.\n\nSo better to have y_8=3.\n\nNow, with y_8=3, we reach at t=14.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=9 before, but at t=8 we must be low, so from t=8 to t=14 is 6 turns to go from y=3 to y=9, which is minimal since 6 steps.\n\nBut at t=9,10,etc., no cars, so we can go fast.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we are higher before t=8, but we can't because at t=8 we must be at y=2 or 3, and before that, we start at y=4.\n\nFrom t=6 to t=8, we have two actions to go from y=4 to y=3 or 2.\n\nWe cannot be higher than y=6 at t=8, but that's unsafe.\n\nSo I think t=14 is the earliest.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nStart: turn t=6, y=4\n\nAfter action a_6 (t=6), position at t=7: y_7\n\nAfter a_7 (t=7), position at t=8: y_8\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{13} (t=13), position at t=14: y_14=9\n\nActions from t=6 to t=13, that's 8 actions: t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nH=8.\n\nSequence: we need to choose how to get y_8=3.\n\nWe have two options:\n\nOption A: a_6 = D, a_7 = S\n\nThen y_7=3, y_8=3\n\nOption B: a_6 = S, a_7 = D\n\nThen y_7=4, y_8=3\n\nIn both cases, we need to go up from t=8 to t=13.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, for the up part, all U.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, for option A: actions\n\nt=6: a_6 = D (down)\n\nt=7: a_7 = S (stay)\n\nThen t=8: a_8 = U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nThen y: t=6:4, t=7:3 (after a_6=D), t=8:3 (after a_7=S), then t=9:4 (U), t=10:5, t=11:6, t=12:7, t=13:8, t=14:9\n\nAt t=7, y=3, which is safe.\n\nt=8, y=3, safe.\n\nt=9, y=4, no issue, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nOption B: t=6: S, then y_7=4\n\nt=7: D, then y_8=3\n\nThen same up actions.\n\nIn this case, at t=7, y=4, which is safe.\n\nBoth seem fine.\n\nBut we need minimal H, which is 8 in both cases.\n\nIs there a way with H=7?\n\nH=7 actions: from t=6 to t=12, position at t=13.\n\ny_{13} =9.\n\nBut y_6=4, to y_13=9 in 7 steps? From turn 6 to turn 13, that's 7 turns later, but positions: y_6 to y_13, 7 steps? Number of actions between.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn 6+k.\n\nSet 6+k=13, k=7 actions.\n\ny_{13} = y_6 + sum_{i=6}^{12} Δy_i = 4 + sum of 7 deltas.\n\nEach delta >= -1, <=1.\n\nTo reach y=9, sum of deltas =5.\n\nSince min sum if all D: 4 -7 = -3, max all U:4+7=11.\n\nSum=5 possible.\n\nBut we have the constraint at t=8.\n\ny_8 must be 2 or 3.\n\ny_8 is after 2 actions: position at turn 8, which is after actions at t=6 and t=7.\n\ny_8 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\nAs before.\n\nThen y_13 = y_8 + sum_{i=8}^{12} Δy_i\n\ny_8 <=3 (since 2 or 3)\n\nThen y_13 <= 3 + sum of 5 deltas (actions t=8 to t=12, 5 actions)\n\nMax sum deltas=5, so y_13 <= 3+5=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\ny_13 = y_8 + (Δy_8 + Δy_9 + Δy_10 + Δy_11 + Δy_12)\n\n5 deltas, each <=1, so y_13 <= y_8 +5\n\nSince y_8 <=3, y_13 <=8 <9.\n\nIf y_8=2, even worse.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=13, because from t=8 to t=13, only 5 actions, can increase by at most 5, but y_8 <=3, so y_13 <=8.\n\nThus minimal is t=14 with y_14=9.\n\nWith H=8 actions.\n\nNow, we can choose either option for the first actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for the up part, we can go directly.\n\nBut in option A, we go down to y=3 at t=7, then stay, then up.\n\nIn option B, stay at t=6, then down to y=3 at t=8, then up.\n\nIn terms of the path, both take same time.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid going down if not necessary, but we have to to be safe at t=8.\n\nSince at t=9 and later all clear, we can go up fast.\n\nAnother thing: at t=7, in option A, y=3, which is low, but safe.\n\nIn option B, y=4 at t=7.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nI think we can choose one.\n\nPerhaps to have higher position earlier, but not necessary.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list actions from turn t_1.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo actions for turn 6,7,8,... up to turn 6+H-1.\n\nWith H=8, actions from turn 6 to 13.\n\nNow, let's pick option B: a_6 = S, a_7 = D, then a_8 to a_13 all U.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=6: y=4, row 4, not occupied at t=6, safe.\n\nt=7: y=4 (after a_6=S), position at t=7 is y_7=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4? y=4 is freeway 4, at t=7, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 4: only occupied at t=8, not t=7, so safe.\n\nt=8: y=3 (after a_7=D), position y_8=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, at t=8, occupied? Freeway 3 occupied only at t=6, not t=8, so safe.\n\nt=9: y=4 (after a_8=U), y_9=4, row 4, at t=9, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=10: y=5, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, at t=12, row 7, is it occupied? Earlier we said only at t=6,7,8,16,etc. t=12 not, so safe.\n\nt=13: y=8, similarly, not occupied at t=13.\n\nt=14: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith option A: a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8 to a_13 U.\n\nt=6: y=4, safe\n\na_6=D: y_7=3\n\nt=7: y=3, row 3, at t=7, occupied? Only at t=6, not t=7, safe.\n\na_7=S: y_8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, safe as before.\n\nThen same.\n\nSo both work.\n\nI think we can choose.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", which is 8, and sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, we list actions from turn t_1.\n\nPerhaps we can write.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach without going down.\n\nFor example, if at t=8, we could be at y=9, but impossible from y=4 in two steps.\n\ny_8 <=6 <9.\n\nOr if we go to y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe at t=8, but then from there to y=9 takes more time.\n\nFor example, if y_8=0, then to y=9, need 9 steps, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus minimal H=8.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think either is fine.\n\nBut in option B, at t=7, we are at y=4, which might be closer, but no difference.\n\nTo make it cleaner, perhaps go with option A: go down first to y=3, then stay, then up.\n\nOr option B: stay, then down, then up.\n\nIn terms of actions, option B has one stay and one down, while option A has one down and one stay, similar.\n\nIn the sequence, let's write one.\n\nI think I'll go with option B.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: S  (stay)\n\nTurn 7: D  (down)\n\nThen Turn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nNow, H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 6 to turn 13, that's 8 turns.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nThe format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 13 action U, position at turn 14 is y=9.\n\nBut the action at turn 13 is the last action.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 to t_1+H-1, here t_1=6, H=8, so up to turn 6+7=13? t_1 + H -1 =6+8-1=13.\n\nYes.\n\nPosition at turn 14=9.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm if at any point we are on a row when occupied.\n\nWe did: t=6: y=4, safe\n\nt=7: y=4 (after S at t=6), row 4 at t=7: freeway 4, not occupied, safe\n\nt=8: y=3 (after D at t=7), row 3 at t=8: not occupied, safe\n\nt=9: y=4 (after U at t=8), row 4 at t=9: not occupied, safe\n\nt=10: y=5, row 5 at t=10: not occupied, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, row 6 at t=11: not occupied, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, row 7 at t=12: not occupied (only at 6,7,8,16,...), safe\n\nt=13: y=8, row 8 at t=13: not occupied, safe\n\nt=14: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith the other option similar.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? We saw not.\n\nPerhaps if we can be at y=9 at an earlier turn, but impossible because of t=8 constraint.\n\nAnother idea: what if at t=8, we are on y=9, but impossible.\n\nOr if we move faster after, but no.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think we need to output.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars at later times, but since we reach before, no issue.\n\nAlso, for freeway 4,5,6, occupied only at t=8, which we avoid.\n\nSo all set.\n\nNow, the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence clearly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 8. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an occupied row at the critical times, particularly at turn 8 when rows \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are occupied.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 6, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\), which is safe since freeway 4 is not occupied at \\(t = 6\\).\n- At turn 7, move down (D) to \\(y = 3\\), which is safe since freeway 3 is not occupied at \\(t = 7\\).\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\), which is safe since freeway 4 is not occupied at \\(t = 8\\) (the occupation is at \\(t = 8\\), but the player moves to \\(y = 4\\) at the end of turn 8, so position at turn 8 is \\(y = 3\\), which is safe).\n- From turns 9 to 13, move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 14. Rows \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe at these times as no cars occupy \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 14 (after 8 actions) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=7, but I think it's a typo; it says t0=7, but I'll use t=7 as the starting turn.\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9. I need to reach y=9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the y you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=7.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when cars are at position 0.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t=7, and they move with constant speed.\n\nFor each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed at t=7, I can find its position at any future turn T.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movement.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at t is [τ, h], and at T, it's [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway k, cars are listed with (h, τ, d, s)\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all cars on the current freeway.\n\nNow, the player position y_t changes based on actions.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=4 at t=7 to y=9 at some turn, with minimal H.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so when at y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible there. Similarly, y=0 might be safe, but I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nBut I start at y=4, which has cars? Freeway y=4 has cars, but at t=7, I'm at y=4, so I need to check if there is collision at t=7.\n\nThe collision condition is at turn T, if player on freeway k, and 0 in span for some car on k.\n\nAt turn t=7, I am at y=4, which is freeway 4? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nLet's see the car state for freeway 4.\n\nFrom table:\n\nFreeway 4: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nOnly one car? It says \"Cars\", but only one tuple, so I think one car per freeway for some, but freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: h=-24, τ=-47, d=right, s=24\n\nSince right-moving, at time t, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -24]? Head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and span is [tail, head] for right, I think from the description.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1, and speed is s. Then at turn T > t1, the car span becomes:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], which implies τ ≤ h, since it's an interval.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, [h, τ] with h ≤ τ? No.\n\nIn left-moving, [h, τ] and h - s(T-t1) to τ - s(T-t1), so if moving left, head should be on the right, so h > τ, I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the head is at higher x, tail at lower x, so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, moving right, head at higher x, tail at lower, both increase.\n\nIn the notation:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], but if it's moving left, and h is head, τ tail, then h > τ, so [h, τ] would be from high to low, but usually we write intervals with min first.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and if h > τ, then h - sΔT > τ - sΔT, so the interval is [τ - sΔT, h - sΔT] but the description says [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], which would have min and max swapped if h > τ.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nAssume that for left-moving, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end, so h > τ, and span is [τ, h]? But the description says for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ].\n\nIt says: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nBut [h, τ] with h > τ would be empty or invalid, so probably h and τ are such that for left-moving, h is left head or something.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined relative to direction.\n\nLet's read the initial description.\n\n\"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFor this to make sense, for right-moving, τ and h such that τ < h, so [τ, h] is the span.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], which must be with h and τ such that the interval is defined, so if moving left, head h is on the right, so h > τ, but [h, τ] with h > τ is not standard; it should be [min, max].\n\nI think it's a notation issue; [h, τ] for left-moving means the interval from h to τ, but since it's moving left, h is decreasing, τ is decreasing, so at t1, if h is position, τ is position, and for left-moving, h > τ, so the interval [h, τ] has min τ, max h, but it's written as [h, τ] which might imply h is start, but in context, it's just the set.\n\nIn collision, we care if 0 is in the span, so we can think of the interval.\n\nFor collision, we need to know for each freeway, at each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nThe span is a closed interval, I assume.\n\nFor a given car at turn T, the span is as above.\n\nFor right-moving car: at T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince at t1, span is [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] with [h, τ] at t1.\n\nBut for left-moving, at t1, [h, τ], so min is min(h,τ), max is max(h,τ).\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define for each car the position at time T.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t1, with t1=7.\n\nFor a car, let left end and right end at t1.\n\nFor right-moving car: at t1, left end (tail) τ, right end (head) h, so positions from τ to h.\n\nAt T, left end = τ + s ΔT, right end = h + s ΔT.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, if head is h, tail is τ, and moving left, so head is at higher x, so right end is h, left end is τ, with h > τ.\n\nThen at t1, positions from τ to h.\n\nSpan(t1) = [h, τ] is confusing; it says [h, τ] for left-moving, but if h is head and left-moving, h is right end, so the interval should be [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the description.\n\nLook at the car state given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (60, 25, right, 36)\n\nIf right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [25, 60]? τ=25, h=60, so [25,60], which makes sense, min 25, max 60.\n\nThen for left-moving, it should be similar.\n\nBut in freeway 4, (-24, -47, right, 24), so τ=-47, h=-24, so [ -47, -24] at t1.\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8, multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-36, -47, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4), and (4, -7, right, 4)\n\n(40, 29, right, 4): if right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [29,40], but 29<40, ok.\n\n(4, -7, right,4): [-7,4], ok.\n\n(-36,-47,right,4): [-47,-36], ok.\n\nAll right-moving in this case, no left-moving cars.\n\nCheck the table:\n\nFreeway 1: right, 2: right, 3: right, 4: right, 5: right, 6: right, 7: all right, 8: all right.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving.\n\nThat simplifies.\n\nSo for all cars, direction is right, so at time t1=7, for a car, span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k and for some car on k, 0 is in [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)]\n\nNow, player starts at t=7, y=4.\n\nFirst, is there collision at t=7 on y=4?\n\nFreeway 4: car (h=-24, τ=-47, s=24, right)\n\nAt T=7, span [τ, h] = [-47, -24]\n\n0 in [-47,-24]? -47 <= 0 <= -24? 0 is greater than -24? -24 < 0, so 0 not in [-47,-24], since -24 < 0, and -47 < -24, so min -47, max -24, 0 > -24, so no, 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but at t=7, player on y=4, so only check y=4.\n\nSo no collision at start.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I start at y=4, need to go to y=9, which is 5 steps up, but I can move diagonally? No, each move changes y by at most 1, so minimum 5 moves if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, which could increase turns.\n\nSo H min is at least 5, but could be more if I detour.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, but moving down might not help if I need to go up.\n\nBut to avoid cars, I might need to wait on some row.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether it is occupied at position 0.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, at turn T, is there a car such that 0 in its span.\n\nFor each car, the span at T is [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)]\n\n0 in this interval iff τ + s(T-7) <= 0 <= h + s(T-7)\n\nSince τ <= h, it's when the interval covers 0.\n\nFor a given car, the times when it covers 0 can be found.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, for each freeway, I need the times when at least one car covers 0.\n\nThen, when player is on that freeway at that turn, collision happens.\n\nPlayer moves to a new y at each turn based on action.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ=25, h=60, s=36, right\n\nAt T, span [25 + 36(T-7), 60 + 36(T-7)]\n\n0 in this when 25 + 36ΔT <= 0 <= 60 + 36ΔT, where ΔT = T-7\n\nSince 25 + 36ΔT <=0 and 0<=60+36ΔT, but 60+36ΔT >0 for all ΔT>=0 since min at ΔT=0 is 60>0, so only need 25 + 36ΔT <=0\n\nSo 36ΔT <= -25, ΔT <= -25/36 ≈ -0.694, but ΔT = T-7 >=0 for future turns, so no, 25+36ΔT >=25>0 for T>=7, so 0 not in interval ever for T>=7. Similarly, for past it might, but we care future.\n\nSo for freeway 1, no collision possible for T>=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? From table, freeway 2: (60,25,right,36), same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (60,25,right,36)\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3: no car at 0 for T>=7.\n\nFreeway 4: car τ=-47, h=-24, s=24, right\n\nAt T, span [-47 + 24ΔT, -24 + 24ΔT], ΔT=T-7\n\n0 in this when -47 +24ΔT <=0 <= -24 +24ΔT\n\nNow, -47+24ΔT <=0 => 24ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +24ΔT => 24ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT=1 and ΔT=2, since ΔT integer, T=8 and T=9.\n\nΔT=1: T=8, span [-47+24, -24+24] = [-23, 0], 0 is included.\n\nΔT=2: T=9, span [-47+48, -24+48] = [1,24], 0 not in.\n\n-47+48=1, -24+48=24, so [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=1: -47+24= -23? 24*1=24, -47+24= -23, -24+24=0, so [-23,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=2: -47+48=1, -24+48=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=0: T=7, [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 4, collision at T=8 only? T=8, ΔT=1.\n\nT=9, no.\n\nΔT=1: T=8, [ -23, 0], 0 is endpoint, included, I assume, since closed interval.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=0 and ΔT=2 not.\n\nNow ΔT=3: [-47+72, -24+72]= [25,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=8, freeway 4 has a car at 0.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? Freeway 5: (-24,-47,right,24), same as 4? τ=-47, h=-24? In table it says (-24,-47,right,24), but for right-moving, span is [τ,h], so τ should be tail, smaller.\n\nIn freeway 4 it was (-24,-47,right,24), but (-24,-47), so if τ and h, for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-47,-24], same as before.\n\nFreeway 5: also (-24,-47,right,24), so same as freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same.\n\nSo freeways 4,5,6: each has collision only at T=8.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (-36,-47,right,4), (40,29,right,4), and (4,-7,right,4)\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36? (h=-36, τ=-47, right, s=4)\n\nSpan at t1: [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 + 4ΔT, -36 + 4ΔT ]\n\n0 in this when -47+4ΔT <=0 <= -36+4ΔT\n\n-47+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 11.75\n\n0 <= -36+4ΔT => 4ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=9\n\nSo ΔT >=9 and ΔT <=11.75, so for ΔT=9,10,11\n\nΔT=9: [ -47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔT=10: [ -47+40, -36+40] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=11: [ -47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=12: [ -47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly, second car: (40,29,right,4), τ=29? h=40, τ=29, span [29,40] at t1\n\nAt T: [29 +4ΔT, 40+4ΔT]\n\n0 in? 29+4ΔT <=0? 29+4ΔT >=29>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (4,-7,right,4), h=4, τ=-7, span [-7,4] at t1\n\nAt T: [-7 +4ΔT, 4 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in when -7+4ΔT <=0 <= 4+4ΔT\n\n-7+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=7 => ΔT <= 1.75\n\n0 <=4+4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nSo only when ΔT <=1.75, so ΔT=0,1\n\nΔT=0: T=7, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=1: T=8, [-7+4,4+4]= [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=2: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, cars:\n\n- First car: covers 0 at ΔT=9,10,11 → T=16,17,18\n\n- Second car: never\n\n- Third car: covers 0 at ΔT=0,1 → T=7,8\n\nSo overall, freeway 7 has car at 0 when: T=7,8 (from third car), and T=16,17,18 (from first car)\n\nT=7: third car, T=8: third car, T=16: first car, etc.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar cars, (-36,-47,right,4), (40,29,right,4), (4,-7,right,4)\n\nSame as freeway 7, so freeway 8 has car at 0 at T=7,8,16,17,18\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when collision happens, i.e., when 0 is occupied.\n\nFreeway 1: never\n\nFreeway 2: never\n\nFreeway 3: never\n\nFreeway 4: T=8\n\nFreeway 5: T=8\n\nFreeway 6: T=8\n\nFreeway 7: T=7,8,16,17,18\n\nFreeway 8: T=7,8,16,17,18\n\ny=0 and y=9 no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=7, y=4.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S each turn.\n\nEach action changes y: U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\ny must be in 0 to 9.\n\nGoal: y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, I can go up 5 times: from y=4 to 9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, at t=7, on y=4, which is freeway 4, but at t=7, freeway 4 is safe, as we saw earlier, no collision at t=7 for y=4.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, at t=7, they have collision, but I'm not on them.\n\nNow, at t=7, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nIf I move up to y=5 at next turn.\n\nLet's think about the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T.\n\nBut since I move step by step, and I need to avoid being on a row when it is occupied at 0.\n\nThe collision depends on the row I am on at that turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t=7.\n\nSet t=7 as time 0 for simplicity. Let τ = t - 7, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nPlayer position at time τ: y_τ, with y_0 = 4.\n\nAction at each τ, a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on a_τ.\n\nAfter H steps, at time τ=H, y_H =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position is for next turn.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position (0, y_t)\n\nThen choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy with Δy as above.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action, at beginning of turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of each turn, based on y_t and the car positions at turn t.\n\nIn the dynamics: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note: when you move to new y, you are not on new y until next turn, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision depends on cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need actions from t=7 onwards.\n\nIn terms of τ, let τ = t - 7, so at τ=0, y=4.\n\nThen at turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nAfter H steps, at τ=H, y_H =9.\n\nτ from 0 to H, with y_0=4, y_H=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, for H turns including start.\n\nStart at t=7, after H-1 actions, at turn t=7 + (H-1), position y_{7 + H-1} =9.\n\nSet T = t - 7, so T=0: turn 7, y=4\n\nT=1: turn 8, y=?\n\n...\n\nUp to some T=K, y_K=9.\n\nThen number of actions: from T=0 to T=K-1, K actions? Let's see.\n\nAt T=0 (turn 7), position y_0=4.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 set.\n\nAfter K actions, y_K is set, and if y_K=9, reached.\n\nThe turns involved: from turn 7 to turn 7+K.\n\nAt turn 7+K, position y_K.\n\nCollision checked at each turn from 7 to 7+K-1? No.\n\nAt each turn t, when position is y_t, collision checked.\n\nFor turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and for that row, 0 occupied at t.\n\nThen at turn t, if collision, game over.\n\nWe need no collision at turns from 7 to 7+K-1, and at turn 7+K, y_K=9, which is safe.\n\nSince y=9 safe, no issue.\n\nNow, for the path, from T=0 to T=K, we have positions y_0 to y_K, with y_0=4, y_K=9.\n\nAt each step T, for T=0 to K-1, action a_T determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nCollision at time T if y_T in 1-8 and row y_T occupied at time T.\n\nTime T corresponds to turn t=7+T.\n\nNow, occupied times for each row:\n\nSince freeways 1,2,3 always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=1 (since at t=8, τ=1)\n\nT= t-7, so at T=1, turn t=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: occupied at T=1\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=1\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=0,1,9,10,11 (since T=0: turn7, T=1: turn8, T=9: turn16, T=10: turn17, T=11: turn18)\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied at T=0,1,9,10,11\n\nNow, I need to go from y_0=4 to y_K=9 for some K.\n\ny_T changes by -1,0,1 each step.\n\nMinimal K: since from y=4 to y=9, delta y=5, so min K=5 if always up.\n\nBut need to avoid collisions.\n\nAt T=0, y_0=4.\n\ny_0=4, which is freeway 4, and at T=0, freeway 4 is safe? At T=0, turn7, for freeway 4, we had no occupation, as earlier.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=0: not occupied, since only at T=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 occupied at T=0.\n\nBut y_0=4, not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nNow, if I go up at T=0: action U, then y_1 = y_0 +1 =5\n\nAt T=1, y_1=5, which is freeway 5.\n\nAt T=1, freeway 5 is occupied (since all freeways 4,5,6 occupied at T=1).\n\nFreeway 5 occupied at T=1, so if y_1=5, collision.\n\nIf I go down, y_1=3, freeway 3, which is always safe, no problem.\n\nIf stay, y_1=4, freeway 4, which is occupied at T=1, so collision.\n\nSo at T=0, if I do U or S, at T=1 I will be on a row that is occupied.\n\nIf U, y_1=5, occupied.\n\nIf S, y_1=4, occupied.\n\nIf D, y_1=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nSo only choice is to go down to y=3 at T=1.\n\nAction at T=0: D, so a_{t=7} = D\n\nThen at T=1, y_1=3, freeway 3, safe since no cars ever at 0.\n\nNow at T=1, position y=3.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf I go up to y=4, but at T=1, y=4 is freeway 4, occupied, so if I go to y=4 at T=2? Let's see.\n\nAt time T=1, I am at y=3.\n\nI choose action for next position.\n\nAction a_1, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy.\n\nCollision at T=1: since y_1=3, freeway 3 safe, no collision.\n\nNow, for T=2, turn t=9.\n\nI need to set y_2.\n\nIf I go up, y_2=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=2, turn9, for freeway 4: occupation only at T=1, not at T=2, since only at t=8, which is T=1.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied only at T=1, not before or after for near future.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 safe at T=2.\n\nIf I stay, y_2=3, safe.\n\nIf down, y_2=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, at T=2, if I go to y=4, it should be safe.\n\ny_2=4, freeway 4 at T=2, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up further.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent at T=1, y=3.\n\nIf I go up at T=1: action U, then y_2=4.\n\nAt T=2, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=2, I can go up again to y=5.\n\ny_3=5.\n\nAt T=3, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nNow, freeway 5 occupied only at T=1, not at T=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, go up to y=6 at T=3? Action at T=2: U, y_3=5.\n\nAt T=3, y=5, safe.\n\nThen action at T=3: U, y_4=6.\n\nAt T=4, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 occupied only at T=1, not at T=4, safe.\n\nThen action at T=4: U, y_5=7.\n\nAt T=5, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nNow, freeway 7 occupied at T=0,1,9,10,11.\n\nT=5 is turn t=12 (since T=0 turn7, T=5 turn12).\n\nT=5 not in {0,1,9,10,11}, so not occupied, safe.\n\nThen action at T=5: U, y_6=8.\n\nAt T=6, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 occupied at T=0,1,9,10,11, T=6 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at T=6: U, y_7=9.\n\nAt T=7, y=9, which is not freeway, safe, and reached.\n\nSo in this path, I reached at T=7, y=9.\n\nNow, actions: from T=0 to T=6.\n\nT=0: action D, y from 4 to 3\n\nT=1: action U, y from 3 to 4\n\nT=2: action U, y from 4 to 5\n\nT=3: action U, y from 5 to 6\n\nT=4: action U, y from 6 to 7\n\nT=5: action U, y from 7 to 8\n\nT=6: action U, y from 8 to 9\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nAt T=0: y=4, safe\n\nT=1: y=3, safe\n\nT=2: y=4, safe\n\nT=3: y=5, safe\n\nT=4: y=6, safe\n\nT=5: y=7, safe (since T=5 not occupied time)\n\nT=6: y=8, safe (T=6 not occupied)\n\nT=7: y=9, safe, but collision not checked since not freeway, or checked but no cars.\n\nThe last collision check is at T=6 for y=8.\n\nAt T=7, y=9, no need to check.\n\nIn this sequence, I used 7 actions: from T=0 to T=6, 7 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions at times: T=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 → 7 actions.\n\nAfter 7 actions, y at T=7 is 9.\n\nTurn t: start t=7, after 0 actions, y=4.\n\nAfter first action (at t=7), y at t=8.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=7+k.\n\nSet t=7 as initial.\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn t=7, y=4\n\nAfter 1 action: turn t=8, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions: turn t=7+H, y=?\n\nWe want y at some turn to be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions at t=7, t=8, ..., up to t=13? Let's map.\n\nTurn t=7 (T=0): action a_7, then y at t=8 is set.\n\nPosition at turn t: y_t\n\nAt turn t=7: y_7=4\n\nChoose a_7, then y_8 = y_7 + Δy\n\nAt turn t=8: y_8, check collision based on y_8 and cars at t=8.\n\nThen choose a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy, and so on.\n\nUntil at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nIn my earlier, at T=0 (t=7), I did action D, so y_8 = y_7 -1 =3\n\nAt turn t=8: y=3, freeway 3, no collision.\n\nThen action at t=8: U, so y_9 =3 +1=4\n\nAt turn t=9: y=4, freeway 4, at t=9, which is T=2, freeway 4 safe.\n\nThen action at t=9: U, y_10 =4+1=5\n\nTurn t=10: y=5, freeway 5, at t=10, T=3, freeway 5 safe (only occupied at t=8)\n\nSimilarly, action at t=10: U, y_11=5+1=6\n\nTurn t=11: y=6, freeway 6, safe at T=4.\n\nAction at t=11: U, y_12=6+1=7\n\nTurn t=12: y=7, freeway 7, at t=12, which is T=5, not occupied time (occupied at T=0,1,9,10,11 → t=7,8,16,17,18)\n\nt=12 is T=5, not in, safe.\n\nAction at t=12: U, y_13=7+1=8\n\nTurn t=13: y=8, freeway 8, at t=13, T=6, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction at t=13: U, y_14=8+1=9\n\nTurn t=14: y=9, reached, safe.\n\nSo actions from t=7 to t=13, that's 7 actions.\n\nBut I could do better? Min is 5, but at the beginning, I had to go down because at t=8, y=4,5,6 are all occupied, so I couldn't be on them.\n\nIn this case, by going down to y=3 at t=8, I avoided.\n\nIs there a way to go directly?\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=4.\n\nIf I stay or up, at t=8 I would be on y=4 or 5, which are occupied.\n\nOnly down to y=3.\n\nThen from y=3, I can go up to y=4 at t=9, which is safe, then continue up.\n\nBut going to y=4 at t=9 takes an extra turn.\n\nCould I go to another row?\n\nFor example, at t=8, if I could be on a safe row.\n\nBut at t=8, which rows are safe?\n\nFreeways: y=1,2,3 always safe.\n\ny=4,5,6 occupied at t=8.\n\ny=7 and 8 occupied at t=8, since T=1.\n\nAt t=8 (T=1), occupied rows: y=4,5,6 (from freeways 4,5,6) and y=7,8 (from freeways 7,8).\n\nOnly y=1,2,3 safe at t=8.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at t=7, I can only reach y=3,4,5 at t=8.\n\ny=4 and y=5 occupied, so only y=3 safe.\n\nThus, must go to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I am at y=3, which is safe.\n\nNow, at t=8, I need to choose action to set y at t=9.\n\nPossible: U to y=4, S to y=3, D to y=2.\n\nNow, at t=9, which rows occupied?\n\nt=9 is T=2.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: not occupied at T=2.\n\nFreeway 7,8: not occupied at T=2, only at T=0,1,9,10,11.\n\nT=2 not occupied.\n\nSo all rows safe at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, for several turns.\n\nI can go up from y=3 to y=4 at t=9.\n\nAs before.\n\nCould I go up faster?\n\nFor example, from t=8, y=3, if I go up to y=4 at t=9.\n\nBut if I go up twice, but at t=8 I am at y=3, if I go up, to y=4 at t=9.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=10, etc., same as before.\n\nAt t=8, y=3, I could go down to y=2, but that would take longer to go up, not better.\n\nOr stay, but staying doesn't help.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems efficient.\n\nBut in terms of turns, I reached at t=14, with y=9.\n\nt=14 is after 7 actions? From t=7 to t=13 actions, 7 actions, position at t=14 is 9.\n\nBut min possible is 5, but I had to detour to y=3.\n\nIs there a way to go through other rows?\n\nFor example, at t=7, go down to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, go up to y=4 at t=9.\n\nBut that takes two turns to be at y=4 at t=9, whereas at t=7 I was at y=4, but couldn't stay because of t=8.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 at t=8? But at t=8, y=5 occupied, cannot.\n\nOr go down to y=3, then at t=8, since y=3 is safe, and I can go to y=2 or something, but y=2 is safe, but then I have to go up more steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps wait on a safe row.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at t=8, but I need to leave.\n\nIn my sequence, I only wasted one turn: I went down to y=3 instead of up, so I lost one step, then from y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps, but since I started from y=4, to y=9 is 5 up, but I went down first, so net +4 in 6 moves? Let's see the y positions.\n\nt=7: y=4\n\nt=8: y=3 (after down)\n\nt=9: y=4 (up)\n\nt=10: y=5 (up)\n\nt=11: y=6 (up)\n\nt=12: y=7 (up)\n\nt=13: y=8 (up)\n\nt=14: y=9 (up)\n\nSo from t=7 to t=14, 7 turns later, y=9.\n\nBut at t=7 I was at y=4, after 7 actions at t=14.\n\nNumber of turns from start: at turn t, after (t-7) actions.\n\nAt t=7, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action at t=7, position at t=8.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=7+H.\n\nSet at t=7+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=7, t=14.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nBut with no cars, H=5: actions U,U,U,U,U from y=4 to5,6,7,8,9 at t=8,9,10,11,12.\n\nBut with cars, at t=8, if I were at y=5, occupied, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nBy going down first, I avoided.\n\nBut is there a path with H=6?\n\nFor example, reach at t=13.\n\nThen position at t=13 should be y=9.\n\nThat means at t=12, y=8 or 9? If at t=12 y=8, and action U to y=9 at t=13.\n\nOr if at t=12 y=9, but then reached earlier.\n\nAssume reach at t=13.\n\nSo y_{13}=9.\n\nThen at t=12, y_{12} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{12}=9, reached at t=12, better.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom t=7 to t=12 is 5 turns later, position at t=12.\n\nIf I can be at y=9 at t=12.\n\nThat means from y=4 at t=7 to y=9 at t=12, in 5 steps: actions from t=7 to t=11, 5 actions.\n\ny changes from 4 to 9 in 5 moves, so must go up 5 times, no down or stay.\n\nSo actions: U,U,U,U,U at t=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=7: y=4\n\nAfter a7=U: t=8, y=5\n\nAfter a8=U: t=9, y=6\n\nAfter a9=U: t=10, y=7\n\nAfter a10=U: t=11, y=8\n\nAfter a11=U: t=12, y=9\n\nNow check collisions.\n\nAt t=7: y=4, freeway 4, at t=7, safe as before.\n\nAt t=8: y=5, freeway 5, at t=8, occupied (since T=1), collision! Cannot.\n\nIf I start with down, but then I cannot reach in 5 steps.\n\nFor example, if at t=7, action D, then t=8 y=3\n\nThen to reach y=9 at t=12, I need from y=3 to y=9 in 4 steps, which requires 4 up, but 3 to 9 is +6, in 4 steps impossible, since max +4.\n\ny=3 at t=8, after 4 actions to t=12, y at t=12.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, after actions at t=8,9,10,11, to set y at t=9,10,11,12.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=12, need to increase by 6 in 4 steps, impossible, min y at t=12 is y=3 if all down, max y=3+4=7 if all up.\n\nCannot reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay somewhere.\n\nTo reach at t=12, y must be 9 at t=12.\n\nAt t=7, y=4.\n\nAfter 5 actions (t=7 to t=11), y at t=12 set.\n\nThe position at t=12 depends on actions from t=7 to t=11.\n\ny_{12} = y_7 + sum_{t=7 to 11} Δy_t\n\ny_7=4, y_12=9, so sum Δy = +5 over 5 actions, so must all be U, no S or D.\n\nThus, only possible with all U, but as above, at t=8 y=5 occupied.\n\nThus impossible to reach at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, to reach at t=13: y=9 at t=13.\n\nThen y at t=13 from actions t=7 to t=12.\n\n6 actions.\n\ny_13 = y_7 + sum_{t=7 to 12} Δy_t = 4 + sum =9, so sum Δy = +5 over 6 actions.\n\nSo I can have one S or one D, but since I need +5, if I have one D, I need extra U, etc., but net +5.\n\nFor example, five U and one S, or four U and one D and one extra U, but net +5.\n\nBut in this case, positions.\n\nNow, at t=8, I must not be on y=4,5,6.\n\nBecause at t=8, these are occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 occupied at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, I must be on y=1,2,3.\n\nSince at t=7, y=4, to be at y<=3 at t=8, I must do D at t=7, so y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3.\n\nNow, from t=8 to t=13, I need to go from y=3 to y=9 in 5 steps? y at t=13.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, after actions t=8 to t=12, 5 actions, to set y at t=9 to t=13.\n\ny_{13} = y_8 + sum_{t=8 to 12} Δy_t = 3 + sum =9, so sum Δy = +6 over 5 actions, impossible, max +5, so y<=8 at t=13.\n\ny_8=3, after 5 actions (t=8 to t=12), y at t=13.\n\ny_{13} = y_8 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so max y_{13} = 3 +5 =8, min 3-5=-2, but y=9>8, impossible to reach y=9 at t=13 from y=3 at t=8 with 5 actions.\n\ny at t=13 is set after action at t=12.\n\ny_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}\n\nBut y_{12} depends on previous.\n\nSince y_8=3, and 5 actions to influence y_9 to y_{13}.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy8\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy9 = y_8 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\n...\n\ny_{13} = y_8 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\nSince y_8=3, and y_{13}=9, so Δy8 + ... + Δy12 = 6\n\nBut each |Δy| <=1, so sum of 5 terms, max +5, cannot be +6. Contradiction.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 at t=13 if y_8=3.\n\nBut if I don't go down, I cannot be safe at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, I must be on y=1,2,3 to be safe.\n\nIf I were on y=1 or 2 at t=8, even worse, y lower, harder to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFor example, if at t=8 y=2, then y_8=2, y_{13} = 2 + sum_{t=8 to12} Δy_t, max 7, cannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y=1, max 6.\n\nSo only possible to be at y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen y_8=3.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=13: y_{13}=9, y_8=3, so need +6 in the changes from t=8 to t=12, but there are only 5 actions affecting y_9 to y_{13}, but y_{13} - y_8 = Δy8 + ... + Δy12 =6, 5 terms, impossible.\n\ny_{13} - y_8 = (y_9 - y_8) + (y_{10} - y_9) + ... + (y_{13} - y_{12}) = Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\nYes, 5 differences, each at most +1, so y_{13} <= y_8 + 5 = 8.\n\nThus y_{13} <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14: y_{14}=9.\n\ny_8=3, y_{14} = y_8 + Δy8 + ... + Δy13\n\n6 differences: Δy8 to Δy13.\n\ny_{14} - y_8 = Δy8 + ... + Δy13 = 9 - 3 =6, so possible with all +1, i.e., all U.\n\nNow, with y_8=3, if I go all up: actions U at t=8,9,10,11,12,13\n\nThen y: t=8:3, a8=U, t=9:4\n\na9=U, t=10:5\n\na10=U, t=11:6\n\na11=U, t=12:7\n\na12=U, t=13:8\n\na13=U, t=14:9\n\nNow check collisions.\n\nAt t=8: y=3, safe\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4, at t=9 (T=2), not occupied, safe\n\nt=10: y=5, freeway 5, at t=10 (T=3), not occupied, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, freeway 6, at t=11 (T=4), not occupied, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, freeway 7, at t=12 (T=5), not occupied (occupied at T=9,10,11 which are t=16,17,18), safe\n\nt=13: y=8, freeway 8, at t=13 (T=6), not occupied, safe\n\nt=14: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd I reached at t=14.\n\nIn this sequence, actions: at t=7: D (to go to y=3 at t=8)\n\nThen t=8: U (to y=4 at t=9)\n\nt=9: U (y=5 at t=10)\n\nt=10: U (y=6 at t=11)\n\nt=11: U (y=7 at t=12)\n\nt=12: U (y=8 at t=13)\n\nt=13: U (y=9 at t=14)\n\nBut at t=13 action U to go to y=9 at t=14.\n\nIn terms of actions, from t=7 to t=13, 7 actions.\n\nBut in this, I have one extra action because I went down first.\n\nIn the all-up part from t=8 to t=13, 6 actions to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nBut since I had to go down at t=7, it takes 7 actions total.\n\nIs there a way with 6 actions?\n\nFor example, reach at t=13.\n\nBut earlier we saw impossible if start from y=4.\n\ny at t=13=9.\n\ny_7=4.\n\ny_{13} = y_7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + ... + Δy12\n\n6 differences: Δy7 to Δy12.\n\ny_{13} - y_7 =5, so sum of 6 Δy must be +5.\n\nThus, five U and one other, either S or D.\n\nIf one S, then net +5, but positions.\n\nNow, at t=8, I must not be on y=4,5,6,7,8 because all occupied except y=1,2,3.\n\ny=4,5,6,7,8 all occupied at t=8.\n\ny=7 and 8 also occupied.\n\nOnly y=1,2,3 safe.\n\nSo at t=8, y must be in {1,2,3}.\n\nAt t=7, y=4, so to have y_8 <=3, must have Δy7 <= -1, so action D at t=7, y_8=3.\n\nCannot be S or U.\n\nSo y_8=3.\n\nThen y_13 = y_8 + Δy8 + ... + Δy12\n\ny_13=9, y_8=3, so Δy8 + ... + Δy12 =6\n\nBut 5 differences, max +5, so y_13 <= 3+5=8 <9, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12 impossible as before.\n\nThus, minimal to reach at t=14 with 7 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=7 to t=13.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nIn my first sequence, I had:\n\nAt t=7: D\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nBut at t=11: y=6? In this: after t=7 D, t=8 y=3\n\nt=8 U, t=9 y=4\n\nt=9 U, t=10 y=5\n\nt=10 U, t=11 y=6\n\nt=11 U, t=12 y=7\n\nt=12 U, t=13 y=8\n\nt=13 U, t=14 y=9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I need to specify the actions for the turns.\n\nAlso, in the freeway 7 and 8, there are later occupations, but at T=5,6 which is t=12,13, we are on y=7 and 8, but they are not occupied at those times, so fine.\n\nNow, the minimal H: H is the number of turns? In the problem, H is the minimal number of turns, I think.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the context, \"minimal number of turns H\" probably means the number of actions or the steps.\n\nRead: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the player update: after actions, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nStart at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, y at t1+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, y at t1 + H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t1 to t1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn the answer, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., up to the action before reaching.\n\nIn this case, t1=7.\n\nWe reach at t=14, so t1 + H =14, so 7 + H =14, H=7.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=13.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut at turn 13, action U, to go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence? We saw no.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down by going to another row.\n\nFor example, at t=7, instead of down, but if I go up or stay, collision at t=8.\n\nUnless I can be on a row not occupied at t=8, but from y=4, I can only go to y=3,4,5 at t=8.\n\ny=4 and 5 occupied, only y=3.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps later, but I think 7 is minimal.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go down to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, instead of going up immediately, but if I stay or down, it takes longer, worse.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about freeway 7 and 8 occupations at later times, but not relevant for this short path.\n\nIn this path, we are done by t=14, before t=16.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car that occupies at T=0 and T=1, but we avoided.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=7, we are on y=4, not 7 or 8.\n\nAt t=8, on y=3, not 7 or 8.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, output.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have seven actions.\n\nPerhaps I can combine.\n\nAnother thought: since y=1,2,3 are always safe, but I need to go up.\n\nSuppose at t=7, I go down to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I go up to y=4 at t=9.\n\nBut as before.\n\nAt t=8, I go up to y=4 at t=9, etc.\n\nI think it's optimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 8 to avoid the collision on freeways \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) at turn 8, then moving up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 7, action \\(D\\) (down) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 8, avoiding collision on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, action \\(U\\) (up) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nCollision checks:\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 not occupied (safe).\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 always safe (no cars at position 0).\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 not occupied at turn 9 (safe).\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 not occupied at turn 10 (safe).\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 not occupied at turn 11 (safe).\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 not occupied at turn 12 (occupied only at turns 7, 8, 16, 17, 18).\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 not occupied at turn 13 (safe).\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 9\\), no freeway, safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns, as shorter sequences (e.g., 5 or 6 turns) are impossible due to the collision at turn 8 on freeways \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\), requiring an initial detour to \\(y = 3\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since I start at y=3 and need to get to y=9, I probably need to move up most of the time, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, the cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars moving either left or right, with given positions and speeds. I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, there's no car that collides with me. Collision happens if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, I'm on the freeway based on my position at that turn. If I move to a new y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new freeway until the next turn. Let me read that carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And y_T is my y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, it says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that when I move from one row to another, during the turn when I'm moving, I'm only on the starting row for collision purposes. For example, if at turn T I'm at y, and I move to y+1, then at turn T, I'm on row y, so I check cars on row y for collision at turn T. At turn T+1, I'm on row y+1, so I check cars on row y+1.\n\nMoreover, for the cars, their positions are updated based on the time elapsed. Since we're starting from turn t_1 = 8, and we're looking at future turns, for any turn T > t_1, the car spans are given by the update rule.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity, but in the problem it's t_1=8, so I'll use τ = t - t_1 as the offset. So at τ=0, turn t=8.\n\nPlayer position: y=3.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when cars are at position 0, because that's when a collision would happen if I'm on that row.\n\nThe span is given, and for left-moving cars, span moves left, for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and when they cover x=0.\n\nSince collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at a given turn, I need to find for each freeway and each car, the times when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut since the cars are moving continuously in time, but we have discrete turns, so at integer turns.\n\nLet me define the time from current turn: let Δt = T - t_1, so at Δt=0, it's now.\n\nFor a car, given its head, tail, direction, speed at Δt=0.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at Δt=0 is [h, τ], and at time Δt, span is [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span at Δt=0 is [τ, h], and at Δt, [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nThen 0 is in the span if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nFor left-moving, min is h - s Δt, max is τ - s Δt? No.\n\nLet's be careful.\n\nFor left-moving car: at Δt, the span is [head(Δt), tail(Δt)] = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], and since it's moving left, h < τ? Typically head is the front, but in the notation, it might not be ordered.\n\nLook at the car state:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) — but direction is right, so for right-moving, span at Δt=0 is given as (head, tail) = (-48, -83), but -48 and -83, with direction right.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so it should be the tail and head, with tail < head.\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for the span, it depends on direction.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSince direction is right, the span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-83, -48], because tail is -83, head is -48, so it goes from -83 to -48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume.\n\nBut in this case, all seem to be right-moving except perhaps some.\n\nLet's list all freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) → span at Δt=0: [tail, head] = [-83, -48] for right-moving? Direction right, so span is [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as 1, (-48, -83, right, 36) → span [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -83, right, 36) → span [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: (0, -23, right, 24) → direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nAt Δt=0, h=0, τ=-23, so [ -23, 0 ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, (0, -23, right, 24) → span [-23, 0]\n\nFreeway 6: same, (0, -23, right, 24) → span [-23, 0]\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars: (-32, -43, right, 4), (44, 33, right, 4), (8, -3, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (head, tail) = (-32, -43), direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-43, -32]\n\nSecond car: (44, 33, right, 4) → head=44, tail=33, so since right, span [τ, h] = [33, 44]\n\nThird car: (8, -3, right, 4) → head=8, tail=-3, span [τ, h] = [-3, 8]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, (-32, -43, right, 4), (44, 33, right, 4), (8, -3, right, 4) → spans [-43,-32], [33,44], [-3,8]\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when 0 is in its span at time Δt.\n\nThat is, for a given Δt, min_span(Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ max_span(Δt)\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span changes with Δt.\n\nFirst, for right-moving cars: span at Δt is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nBecause it moves right, so both ends increase by s Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: span [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, no left-moving, from the data.\n\nFreeways 1 to 8 all have right-moving cars, no left-moving mentioned.\n\nSo, for all, right-moving.\n\nSo for a car with span at Δt=0: [τ, h], at Δt, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSince τ ≤ h for right-moving cars.\n\nIn our case, for freeway 1,2,3: τ = -83, h = -48, s=36\n\nSo 0 in span if -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4,5,6: τ = -23, h=0, s=24\n\nAt Δt=0, span is [-23,0], so 0 is included, since 0 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? min=-23, max=0, so 0 is in [-23,0], yes.\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8, multiple cars.\n\nFirst, let's handle the freeways one by one.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, at which times Δt, there is a car such that 0 is in its span, meaning it is dangerous to be on that row at that time.\n\nSince collision happens if at time T, I am on row y_T, and for some car on that row, 0 is in span at T.\n\nSo for each row and each time, I need to know if it is occupied by a car at x=0.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need if any car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nSo for each freeway, I can find the set of Δt where it is dangerous, i.e., some car has 0 in span.\n\nThen, when I am on a row at time Δt, I must not have that row dangerous at that Δt.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=3 at τ=0, and need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, since cars are only on y=1 to 8, so y=9 is always safe, I think. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top.\n\nIn the player position, y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 are always safe, no cars to collide with.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), which is on y=9, so once I'm there, I'm safe.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am at y=3.\n\nI need to go up to y=9, so I need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8, but I can skip some if I move multiple times, but since I move one step per turn, I have to go through each y sequentially, but I can stay or move up/down, so I might stay on a row for multiple turns or move quickly.\n\nBut since I need to minimize turns, I probably want to move up as fast as possible, but avoid the dangerous times on each row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is dangerous, i.e., when some car is at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt\n\nSo let's solve:\n\nLower bound: -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 => 36 Δt ≤ 83 => Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt ≤ 2 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nΔt is integer, since time increases by 1 per turn.\n\nSo Δt = 0,1,2,3,...\n\nSo -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 => 36 Δt ≤ 83 => Δt ≤ 83/36 = 2.305, so for Δt ≤ 2\n\nUpper bound: 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt => 48 ≤ 36 Δt => Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt ≥ 2 since integer? Δt ≥ 2\n\nΔt ≥ ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nAnd Δt ≤ floor(2.305) = 2? Let's see.\n\nLower inequality: -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 => 36 Δt ≤ 83 => Δt ≤ 83/36 = 2.305, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ 2\n\nUpper inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt => 48 ≤ 36 Δt => 36 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt ≥ 2\n\nThus, both inequalities hold when Δt = 2.\n\nFor Δt=2: lower: -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 ≤ 0, true\n\nUpper: 0 ≤ -48 + 72 = 24, 0 ≤ 24 true.\n\nFor Δt=1: lower: -83 + 36= -47 ≤ 0 true\n\nUpper: 0 ≤ -48 + 36 = -12? 0 ≤ -12 false, so not satisfied.\n\nFor Δt=3: lower: -83 + 108=25 ≤0? 25≤0 false, so not.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2 and 3, same as 1, so each has danger only at Δt=2.\n\nNow freeway 4: car with τ=-23, h=0, s=24\n\n0 in span if -23 + 24 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 0 + 24 Δt? Span at Δt: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 24 Δt, 0 + 24 Δt]\n\n0 in span if min ≤ 0 ≤ max, so -23 + 24 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 24 Δt is always true for Δt ≥ 0 since 24 Δt ≥0.\n\nThen -23 + 24 Δt ≤ 0 => 24 Δt ≤ 23 => Δt ≤ 23/24 < 1, so for Δt=0, since Δt integer.\n\nAt Δt=0: min = -23 + 0 = -23 ≤ 0, max=0 ≤0? 0 ≤ 0 is true, since it includes equality.\n\n0 ≤ max: max=0, 0≤0 true.\n\nmin=-23≤0 true.\n\nAt Δt=1: min= -23+24=1, which is >0, so 1 ≤ 0 false? min=1, max=24, so 0 not in [1,24] since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt=0 only.\n\nBut at Δt=0, it is dangerous, but at τ=0, I am at y=3, not on freeway 4, so it doesn't affect me directly, but when I am on row 4 at some time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 and 6 same as 4, each dangerous only at Δt=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32, -43, right, 4) → τ=-43, h=-32, s=4\n\nSpan at Δt: [-43 + 4 Δt, -32 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -43 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 4 Δt\n\nLower: -43 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 => 4 Δt ≤ 43 => Δt ≤ 43/4 = 10.75, so Δt ≤ 10\n\nUpper: 0 ≤ -32 + 4 Δt => 32 ≤ 4 Δt => 4 Δt ≥ 32 => Δt ≥ 8\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nCheck: Δt=8: min= -43+32= -11 ≤0, max= -32+32=0, 0≤0 true.\n\nΔt=9: min= -43+36= -7 ≤0, max= -32+36=4, 0≤4 true.\n\nΔt=10: min= -43+40= -3 ≤0, max= -32+40=8, 0≤8 true.\n\nΔt=11: min= -43+44=1 >0, not ≤0, so false.\n\nSecond car: (44, 33, right, 4) → head=44, tail=33, so span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [33 + 4 Δt, 44 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 33 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 44 + 4 Δt\n\nBut 33 + 4 Δt ≥ 33 >0 for Δt≥0, so min >0, thus 0 < min, so 0 not in span for any Δt. Since min starts at 33 and increases.\n\nThird car: (8, -3, right, 4) → head=8, tail=-3, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-3 + 4 Δt, 8 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -3 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 8 + 4 Δt\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 8 + 4 Δt always true for Δt ≥0.\n\n-3 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 => 4 Δt ≤ 3 => Δt ≤ 3/4 = 0.75, so for Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0: min= -3 ≤0, max=8≥0, true.\n\nFor Δt≥1, min= -3+4=1>0, so not.\n\nSo for freeway 7, dangerous when:\n\n- First car: Δt=8,9,10\n\n- Second car: never\n\n- Third car: Δt=0\n\nSo overall, dangerous at Δt=0 (from third car), and Δt=8,9,10 (from first car).\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has the same cars, so same dangerous times: Δt=0,8,9,10.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the dangerous times:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at Δt=2\n\n- y=2: dangerous at Δt=2\n\n- y=3: I need to know about y=3. Freeway 3 has cars? Freeway 3 is y=3.\n\nFreeways: y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=1: dangerous at Δt=2\n\ny=2: dangerous at Δt=2\n\ny=3: freeway 3, which has car like y=1 and 2, dangerous only at Δt=2\n\ny=4: freeway 4, dangerous at Δt=0\n\ny=5: dangerous at Δt=0\n\ny=6: dangerous at Δt=0\n\ny=7: dangerous at Δt=0,8,9,10\n\ny=8: dangerous at Δt=0,8,9,10\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am at y=3.\n\ny=3 is dangerous at Δt=2, but at τ=0, Δt=0, y=3 is not dangerous now, only at Δt=2.\n\nBut I am on y=3 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, for y=3: dangerous only at Δt=2, so at Δt=0, it is safe? Let's see.\n\nFor y=3, freeway 3, dangerous only at Δt=2, as above.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0, Δt=0, y=3 is safe, since no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5,6 are dangerous at Δt=0, but at τ=0, if I were on them, it would be dangerous, but I am on y=3.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, always.\n\nThe path: I need to be on each row at certain times without being there when dangerous.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 6, since I need to go up 6 steps: from 3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9. But I might stay or go down, but that would take more turns, so minimal should be 6 turns if I can move up every turn without collision.\n\nBut I have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nNow, let's see the dangerous times per row:\n\nList the safe times for each row.\n\nFor row y, safe when not dangerous as above.\n\ny=1: dangerous only at Δt=2, so safe except at Δt=2\n\ny=2: same, safe except Δt=2\n\ny=3: dangerous only at Δt=2, so safe except at Δt=2\n\ny=4: dangerous at Δt=0, so safe for Δt ≥1\n\nSimilarly y=5: dangerous at Δt=0, safe for Δt ≥1\n\ny=6: dangerous at Δt=0, safe for Δt ≥1\n\ny=7: dangerous at Δt=0,8,9,10, so safe when Δt not in {0,8,9,10}\n\nSimilarly y=8: dangerous at Δt=0,8,9,10, safe when Δt not in {0,8,9,10}\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am at y=3, which is safe at Δt=0.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions: U, D, S to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, moving down would be counterproductive, so I should only move up or stay, not down, to minimize turns.\n\nSo actions should be U or S, no D.\n\nNow, let me denote the time from start: let t be the turn offset, t=0,1,2,... where at t=0, position y=3.\n\nAt each time t, I choose action, which determines y_{t+1}, but let's be careful with indexing.\n\nAt time t (offset from t_1), after action, position for next turn.\n\nDefine the state at the beginning of turn.\n\nAt turn τ (relative), before action, position is y_τ.\n\nThen I choose action a_τ, which determines Δy, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nThen at time τ, I am on row y_τ, so I must be safe on that row at time τ.\n\nFor collision at turn τ, it depends on y_τ and the cars at time τ.\n\nThen after action, I move to y_{τ+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn terms of time, at each integer time τ, I am on a row, and that row must not be dangerous at that τ.\n\nThen I move to another row for τ+1.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at τ=0, since dangerous only at τ=2.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is if I move up every turn: from τ=0 y=3, after U, at τ=1 y=4; after U, τ=2 y=5; τ=3 y=6; τ=4 y=7; τ=5 y=8; τ=6 y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if at each time, the position is safe.\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, safe as above.\n\nAt τ=1: if I go to y=4, but at τ=1, y=4: is it safe?\n\ny=4 is dangerous only at τ=0, and safe for τ≥1, so at τ=1, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2: if I am at y=5, y=5 dangerous at τ=0, safe for τ≥1, so at τ=2, safe.\n\nBut at τ=2, if I were on y=3, it would be dangerous, but in this path, at τ=2 I am at y=5, not y=3.\n\nIn the sequence: after actions.\n\nAt τ=0: before action, y=3, safe. I choose a=U, so y_{1} = y_0 +1 =4\n\nAt τ=1: position y=4, now check safety: at time τ=1, on row y=4. y=4 safe for τ≥1, so safe.\n\nChoose a=U, y_2=5\n\nAt τ=2: position y=5, at time τ=2. y=5 safe for τ≥1, so safe.\n\nChoose a=U, y_3=6\n\nAt τ=3: y=6, safe for τ≥1, safe.\n\nChoose a=U, y_4=7\n\nAt τ=4: y=7, at time τ=4.\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=0,8,9,10. τ=4 not in, so safe.\n\nChoose a=U, y_5=8\n\nAt τ=5: y=8, at time τ=5. y=8 dangerous at τ=0,8,9,10. τ=5 not in, so safe.\n\nChoose a=U, y_6=9\n\nAt τ=6: y=9, which is always safe, and I reached (0,9).\n\nNow, H=6 turns? From τ=0 to τ=5, actions at τ=0 to τ=5, and at τ=6 I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: I take actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5, total 6 actions, and after last action, at τ=6, I am at y=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t= t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere H=6, actions at τ=0 to 5.\n\nIn the sequence above, at each step, I was safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, safe.\n\nτ=1: y=4, safe.\n\nτ=2: y=5, safe.\n\nτ=3: y=6, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=7, safe (since τ=4 not dangerous for y=7)\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=0,8,9,10; τ=4 not in.\n\nSimilarly τ=5: y=8, dangerous at τ=0,8,9,10; τ=5 not in, safe.\n\nτ=6: y=9, safe.\n\nSo I reached in 6 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut is there a problem? What about y=7 and y=8 at other times? But in this path, I am only on them at τ=4 and τ=5, which are safe.\n\nAlso, at τ=2, I am on y=5, which is fine, not on y=3 which is dangerous at τ=2.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible.\n\nThe problem is to reach (0,9), and I am there at τ=6.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I might have been on a dangerous row.\n\nFor example, when I move from y=6 to y=7 at τ=3 to τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, I am at y=6, safe. I choose U, so at τ=4, I am at y=7.\n\nDuring the move, at turn τ=3, I am on y=6 when I take the action, and since I move to y=7, at turn τ=3, I am on y=6, so collision check on y=6 at τ=3, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I am on y=7, check on y=7 at τ=4, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut is there a car on y=7 at τ=4? y=7 is safe at τ=4.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7.\n\ny=7 dangerous at τ=0,8,9,10.\n\nτ=4 not in, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut perhaps I can do it faster? From y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 moves up, so 6 turns is minimum possible.\n\nWith stays or down, it would take more, so 6 is best.\n\nBut in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=4,5,6 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4 is dangerous, but I am not on it at τ=0; I am on y=3 at τ=0, and move to y=4 at τ=1, when it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut the car state for freeway 4: at τ=0, span is [-23,0], so at x=0, it is covered, so if I were on y=4 at τ=0, collision, but I am not.\n\nAt τ=1, for y=4, span at τ=1: since right-moving, s=24, span at τ=1: [ -23 + 24*1, 0 + 24*1 ] = [1,24], which does not include 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn my sequence, at τ=1, y=4, safe.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nBut why do I feel like there might be a problem? Perhaps with y=7 and y=8 at later times, but I am not there at those times.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps I should list the action sequence.\n\nStart at τ=0 (turn t_1=8), position (0,3)\n\nAction: U, so to (0,4) at next turn.\n\nAt τ=1 (turn t_1+1), position (0,4), action U, to (0,5)\n\nAt τ=2 (t_1+2), position (0,5), action U, to (0,6)\n\nAt τ=3 (t_1+3), position (0,6), action U, to (0,7)\n\nAt τ=4 (t_1+4), position (0,7), action U, to (0,8)\n\nAt τ=5 (t_1+5), position (0,8), action U, to (0,9)\n\nAt τ=6 (t_1+6), position (0,9), done.\n\nH=6 turns, actions from τ=0 to 5.\n\nIn terms of the sequence: actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + 5}\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1+5: a_{t_1+5} = U\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nBut is there any issue at τ=2? At τ=2, I am on y=5, which is safe, but y=3 is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and y=8, if I were there at τ=0,8,9,10, but I am not.\n\nBut in the sequence, I am at y=7 at τ=4, y=8 at τ=5, both safe times.\n\nτ=4 and 5 are not 8,9,10.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the time: τ=0 is turn t_1=8.\n\nIn the car update, for example, on y=7, dangerous at Δt=0,8,9,10.\n\nΔt=0 is τ=0, turn 8.\n\nΔt=8 is turn t_1 + 8 = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSimilarly, Δt=9 is turn 17, etc.\n\nIn my sequence, at τ=4, turn t_1+4=12, not 16, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it works.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7, there is a car at (8,-3,right,4) which is dangerous at τ=0, but at τ=0, I am not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to stay or something, but in this case, no.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=0, I am at y=3, which is safe, and I move up.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach faster? No, 6 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps with stay, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me make sure about the starting turn.\n\nt_1=8, so:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAfter turn 13 action, position y=9.\n\nTurns: actions at turn 8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nThat's 6 actions.\n\nAt turn 8: after action, but let's see the position.\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=0), before action, position (0,3), I choose action U, so after action, position becomes (0,4) for turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, position (0,4), choose U, to (0,5) for turn 10.\n\n...\n\nAt turn 13, position (0,8), choose U, to (0,9) for turn 14.\n\nBut at turn 14, I am at (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=6, so actions at t=8 to 13.\n\nIn the position, after H actions, I am at y=9 at time t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, t_1 + H = 8 + 6 = 14, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nIn the action sequence, it should be listed for each turn.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4,5,6 at τ=0, they are dangerous, but I am not on them.\n\nBut at τ=0, for y=4,5,6, if I were to stay or something, but I move away.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the collision when moving, but as per the note, when I move, I am only on the starting row for that turn.\n\nFor example, if at some turn I am on a row and move away, I am only checked on the starting row.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nAnother thing: the cars on y=7 and y=8 have dangerous times at τ=0,8,9,10.\n\nτ=0 is now, τ=8 is turn 16, etc.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=7 at τ=4 (turn 12), y=8 at τ=5 (turn 13), both safe.\n\nBut what if I was slower? But I am fast.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier? No.\n\nBut let me check if at τ=2, on y=5, but y=1,2,3 are dangerous at τ=2, but I am on y=5, not on them.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=3 at τ=2, but I left at τ=1 to y=4, so at τ=2, I am not on y=3.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=2, I am on y=5.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think it works.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer format should be the sequence.\n\nNow, t_1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it as per format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\end{array} }\n\nSince it's a sequence.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nHere t=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_8\n\nt=1: a_9\n\n...\n\nt=5: a_{13}\n\nH=6.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at τ=0, there is a car with span including 0, but since I am not on those rows, ok.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid being on a row when a car is coming, but as long as at the exact time I am not on it when 0 is covered, it should be fine.\n\nThe collision is only at the discrete times when the position is checked.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Dangerous Times\nThe dangerous times for each freeway (when a car occupies \\(x = 0\\)) are determined based on the car states at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) and the update rules. The time offset \\(\\Delta t = T - t_1\\) is used, where \\(T\\) is the absolute turn number.\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) (turn 10).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) (turn 10).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) (turn 10).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (turn 8), safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (turn 8), safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (turn 8), safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 8, 9, 10\\) (turns 8, 16, 17, 18).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 8, 9, 10\\) (turns 8, 16, 17, 18).\n\n### Path to Goal\n- Start at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)) at position (0, 3). Freeway y=3 is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (not dangerous until \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)).\n- The minimal path requires moving up 6 steps (from y=3 to y=9) with no down or stay actions, as those would increase \\(H\\).\n- Sequence with all \"U\" (up) actions:\n  - At turn 8 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)): Position (0, 3), safe. Action \"U\" moves to (0, 4) for turn 9.\n  - At turn 9 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)): Position (0, 4). Freeway y=4 is safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\). Action \"U\" moves to (0, 5) for turn 10.\n  - At turn 10 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\)): Position (0, 5). Freeway y=5 is safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\) (dangerous only at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\)). Action \"U\" moves to (0, 6) for turn 11.\n  - At turn 11 (\\(\\Delta t = 3\\)): Position (0, 6). Freeway y=6 is safe for \\(\\Delta t \\geq 1\\). Action \"U\" moves to (0, 7) for turn 12.\n  - At turn 12 (\\(\\Delta t = 4\\)): Position (0, 7). Freeway y=7 is dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 8, 9, 10\\), but \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) is safe. Action \"U\" moves to (0, 8) for turn 13.\n  - At turn 13 (\\(\\Delta t = 5\\)): Position (0, 8). Freeway y=8 is dangerous at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 8, 9, 10\\), but \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) is safe. Action \"U\" moves to (0, 9) for turn 14.\n- At turn 14 (\\(\\Delta t = 6\\)), position (0, 9) is reached. Freeway y=9 has no cars and is always safe.\n\nThis sequence uses 6 turns (\\(H = 6\\)) and avoids all collisions:\n- At no point is the player on a freeway at a dangerous time.\n- Moving up every turn achieves the minimal \\(H = 6\\), as fewer turns are impossible (requires at least 6 up moves).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 5\\):\n- \\(a_{t_1} = a_8 = U\\)\n- \\(a_{t_1+1} = a_9 = U\\)\n- \\(a_{t_1+2} = a_{10} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{t_1+3} = a_{11} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{t_1+4} = a_{12} = U\\)\n- \\(a_{t_1+5} = a_{13} = U\\)\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 9, and I'm starting at y=4.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars with positions that move over time. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of any car at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you're only on the freeway at the turn when you're actually there. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1. You don't occupy both at the same time.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 quickly without being on a freeway when a car is covering position 0.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions at turn t_1 = 9 for each freeway, and then see how they evolve over time.\n\nThe car update is given: for a car, at turn t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving: d = left? The notation says left-moving and right-moving, but in the car state, it says \"direction d\", and in the table, it's written as \"right\" or something. Let me see.\n\nIn the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36) — so direction is right, meaning it's moving right, so as time increases, the span increases to the right.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me clarify the direction.\n\nIn the span update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] at t_1, then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf it's left-moving, and moving left, so position decreases.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but h and τ, which is head and tail? I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so both decrease, meaning the car is moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so both increase, moving right.\n\nIn the car state, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply that τ < h, since it's [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ? I think I need to interpret the head and tail properly.\n\nLet's look at an example.\n\nFor instance, freeway 4: (24, 1, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so it should be right-moving, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [1, 24] I assume, since τ=1, h=24.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [1 + 24*(T-9), 24 + 24*(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7: multiple cars, like (-28, -39, right, 4), etc.\n\nFirst, let's define ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 9 for simplicity. I'll use τ for time difference, but to avoid confusion with tail, let's use Δt.\n\nSet t_1 = 9.\n\nFor any turn T, Δt = T - 9.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, at time T, the span that covers position x=0 is when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nCollision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nPlayer is at x=0 always, since it's (0,y), so only x=0 matters.\n\nSo for each freeway, at each time, I need to know if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at that time.\n\nIf yes, then not safe.\n\nAlso, when moving, if you are at y at turn T, you are on freeway y at turn T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for each turn, you occupy one freeway or y=0 or y=9, but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, so always safe. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4, which is freeway 4, so at turn t_1=9, player is on freeway 4.\n\nNow, for freeway 4 at turn 9, is there a car covering x=0?\n\nFreeway 4 has one car: (24, 1, right, 24)\n\nSince direction right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [1, 24] at T=9.\n\n0 is not in [1,24], since 1 to 24, 0<1, so not covered. So at turn 9, on freeway 4, no collision.\n\nBut we need to move to y=9.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, for each time, when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, define for each car, the time when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car, it covers x=0 at time T if 0 is in Span(T).\n\nFor left-moving car: Span(T) = [h - s(T-9), τ - s(T-9)]\n\nSince it's moving left, head and tail decreasing.\n\nBut in the car state, for left-moving, it might be given with h and τ such that h > τ or something? In this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the table.\n\nLook at the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36) — direction right\n\nFreeway 2: same, right\n\nFreeway 3: same, right\n\nFreeway 4: (24,1,right,24) — right\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, (24,1,right,24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (24,1,right,24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-28,-39,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4) — all right\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-28,-39,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so no left-moving in this instance.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving, so for each car, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] at T=9, and Span(T) = [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] for T>9.\n\nNow, it covers x=0 when 0 is in [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)]\n\nSince it's right-moving, and moving to higher x, so if the span includes 0.\n\nFor a given car, with τ, h, s, at time T, min_span = τ + s(T-9), max_span = h + s(T-9)\n\nIt covers 0 if min_span <= 0 <= max_span\n\nSince τ and h, for right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end at t_1, I think.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ <= x <= h for some x, but at t_1.\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] with Δt = T-9.\n\nSo 0 is covered if τ + sΔt <= 0 <= h + sΔt\n\nSimilarly for multiple cars, if any car on the freeway covers 0 at time T, then unsafe.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find the times when it is unsafe.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car: τ = -47, h = -12, s = 36, direction right.\n\nAt time T, min = τ + sΔt = -47 + 36Δt\n\nMax = h + sΔt = -12 + 36Δt\n\nCover 0 if -47 + 36Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 36Δt <= 0 => 36Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 + 36Δt => 36Δt >= 12 => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333\n\nSo for Δt in [1/3, 47/36] ≈ [0.333, 1.305], since Δt integer? Turns are discrete, so T integer, Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T - 9, T >=9, so Δt >=0 integer.\n\nSo Δt min when 0 <= -12 + 36Δt, so 36Δt >=12, Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so since Δt integer, Δt >=1? 1/3 ≈0.333, so for Δt=0, let's check.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=9, min = -47, max = -12, -47 <=0? 0 <= -12? No, 0 > -12, so 0 not <= max, since max=-12<0, so 0 not in [-47,-12].\n\nAt Δt=1, T=10, min = -47 +36*1 = -11, max = -12 +36*1 = 24\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 24? Yes, -11 <=0 and 0<=24, true.\n\nAt Δt=2, T=11, min = -47 +72 = 25? -47 + 72 = 25, max = -12 +72 =60, 0 <=25? 0 <25, but min=25>0, so 0 not in [25,60], no.\n\nΔt=1: min=-11, max=24, -11<=0<=24 yes.\n\nΔt=0: min=-47, max=-12, 0 not <= -12, no.\n\nSo only at Δt=1, T=10, unsafe for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-12,-47,right,36)? Wait, in table it says (-12,-47,right,36), but for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-47,-12]? I think I have confusion.\n\nIn the car state: it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -12, tail τ = -47, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, the span is [τ, h] at t_1, so [ -47, -12 ]? But -47 to -12, which is from left to right? -47 is left, -12 is right, since -47 < -12? No, numerically -47 < -12, so τ = -47, h = -12, so min is τ = -47, max is h = -12? But -47 < -12, so span [ -47, -12 ] meaning from x=-47 to x=-12.\n\nThen at T, [ τ + sΔt, h + sΔt ] = [ -47 + 36Δt, -12 + 36Δt ]\n\nCover 0 when -47 + 36Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 36Δt\n\nAs I had.\n\nAt Δt=1, [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24], which includes 0.\n\nAt Δt=0, [-47,-12], 0 not in it.\n\nAt Δt=2, [-47+72, -12+72] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=10 unsafe for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same car, so same: only unsafe at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (24,1,right,24)\n\nHead h=24, tail τ=1, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [1,24]\n\nAt T: [1 + 24Δt, 24 + 24Δt]\n\nCover 0 when 1 + 24Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 24Δt\n\nFirst, 1 + 24Δt <= 0? Since 24Δt >=0, 1 + positive, min is at least 1 >0, so 1 + 24Δt >0 for all Δt >=0, so never <=0. Thus, 0 cannot be <= min since min >=1 >0. So never covered. Always safe for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6 same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4) — head h=-28? Tail τ=-39.\n\nDirection right, so span [τ, h] = [-39, -28] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [-39 + 4Δt, -28 + 4Δt]\n\nCover 0 if -39 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -28 + 4Δt\n\nFirst, -39 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <=39 => Δt <= 39/4 = 9.75\n\nSecond, 0 <= -28 + 4Δt => 4Δt >=28 => Δt >=7\n\nSo for Δt from 7 to 9 inclusive? Δt integer.\n\nΔt >=7 and Δt <=9.75, so Δt=7,8,9\n\nAt Δt=7, min= -39 +28 = -11? -39 + 4*7 = -39 + 28 = -11, max= -28 + 28 =0\n\nSo [-11,0], so 0 is included, since <= max=0.\n\n0 <= 0 is true.\n\nAt Δt=8, min= -39 + 32 = -7, max= -28 + 32 =4, so [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=9, min= -39 + 36 = -3, max= -28 + 36 =8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=10, min= -39 +40=1, max= -28+40=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for Δt=7,8,9 → T=16,17,18? Δt=T-9, so for freeway 7, unsafe at T=9+7=16, 9+8=17, 9+9=18.\n\nT=16,17,18.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (48,37,right,4)\n\nHead h=48, tail τ=37, direction right.\n\nSpan [τ,h] = [37,48] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [37 + 4Δt, 48 + 4Δt]\n\nMin=37 +4Δt >=37>0, so never <=0, thus 0 not covered. Always safe for this car.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (12,1,right,4)\n\nHead h=12, tail τ=1, direction right.\n\nSpan [1,12] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt]\n\nMin=1 +4Δt >=1>0, so never covers 0. Always safe.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 7, only the first car causes unsafe at T=16,17,18. Other cars always safe, so freeway 7 unsafe only at T=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has same cars: (-28,-39,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4)\n\nSame as freeway 7, so unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3 unsafe only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 always safe.\n\nFreeway 7,8 unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at turn t=9.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is always safe, as we saw.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path: we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince we want to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe times on the freeways.\n\nCurrent position: at t=9, y=4, on freeway 4, which is safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe vertical positions: y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, always safe.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, always safe.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, times: t=9 is current.\n\nWe need to move from y=4 to y=9, so we need to increase y by 5, so at least 5 moves up, but we can stay or go down, but that would take more turns, so minimal should be 5 moves up, taking 5 turns, to go from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps: at t=10, y=5; t=11, y=6; t=12, y=7; t=13, y=8; t=14, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if at each turn, when on a freeway, it is safe.\n\nAt t=9: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=10: if we go to y=5, but at t=10, we are at y=5? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t=9, we are at y=4. We choose action a_{t} for turn t.\n\nAfter action, at turn t+1, we are at new position.\n\nSo at turn t=9: position (0,4)\n\nAfter action a_9, at turn t=10, position (0, y_{10}) = (0, y_9 + Δy_9)\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9 as soon as possible, we should use U actions.\n\nSuppose we use all U: starting from t=9.\n\nAt t=9, we can choose a_9.\n\nIf we choose U, then at t=10, y=5.\n\nIf we choose S, stay at y=4 for t=10.\n\nBut we want to go up.\n\nFastest: a_9 = U, then at t=10, y=5\n\na_10 = U, t=11, y=6\n\na_11 = U, t=12, y=7\n\na_12 = U, t=13, y=8\n\na_13 = U, t=14, y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, we are on a freeway when y between 1 and 8.\n\nCheck safety:\n\nAt t=9: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nAt t=10: y=5, freeway 5. Freeway 5 is always safe, as established.\n\nAt t=11: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nAt t=12: y=7, freeway 7. Now, freeway 7 is unsafe at T=16,17,18. t=12 is T=12, which is Δt=12-9=3, not 7,8,9, so safe. Earlier we have unsafe only at T=16,17,18, so at T=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=13: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=16,17,18, T=13 not in, safe.\n\nt=14: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo all safe? But at t=10, y=5, freeway 5 safe.\n\nBut freeway 1,2,3 are unsafe at t=10, but we are not on them, so no issue.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo in this sequence, at t=10, we are on y=5, freeway 5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at t=14, so H=5 turns? From t=9 to t=13 actions, then at t=14 position is y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=9 to t=13, 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U.\n\nThen at t=14, y=9.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn t=14, which is after H=5 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=9, position y=4.\n\nAfter action at t=9, at t=10, y=5\n\nAfter action at t=10, at t=11, y=6\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=13, at t=14, y=9.\n\nSo the actions are from t=9 to t=13, and at turn t=14, we are at y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H such that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet t_1 =9.\n\nSo actions at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter executing these actions, the position at turn (t_1 + H) should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t_1 + t, we perform action a_{t_1 + t}, and at turn t_1 + t +1, we are at new position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at position.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, from above, if we start at t_1=9, y=4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nWith all U, we can reach in H=5 actions: actions at t=9,10,11,12,13, then at t=14, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H =9 + H, set to 14, so H=5.\n\nAnd as above, all positions are safe.\n\nBut is there a problem? At t=10, freeway 1,2,3 are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nWe are on freeway 5 at t=10, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 7 and 8 unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on freeway 7 at t=12, which is T=12, not 16-18, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut the player is at y=7 at t=12, freeway 7.\n\nt=12 is T=12, Δt=3, not 7,8,9, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? But from y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 moves up, so 5 actions are minimal.\n\nUnless we start by staying or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=5 should be achievable.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, at T=16,17,18 unsafe, but we are not there at those times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=12, y=7, safe.\n\nBut is there any constraint that forces us to wait?\n\nPerhaps I should list the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=10 only\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=10\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=10\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\nNow, in our path: we are on:\n\nt=9: y=4, safe\n\nt=10: y=5, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, safe (since T=12 not 16-18)\n\nt=13: y=8, safe (T=13 not 16-18)\n\nt=14: y=9, safe\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut at t=10, if we were on freeway 1,2,3, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSo the sequence: actions at t=9: U, to go to y=5 at t=10\n\nIn terms of actions: at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}\n\nBut for collision, at turn t, we are at y_t, and we check if on freeway, collision.\n\nIn this case, at each turn, we are safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly.\n\nBut there is a car on freeway 4 at t=9? Freeway 4 has car (24,1,right,24), at t=9, span [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAnd we move away immediately.\n\nBut in the sequence, no issue.\n\nThe problem is to output the actions starting from t_1.\n\nSo for t_1=9, action a_9 = U\n\nThen at t=10, y=5, which is safe, action a_10 = U\n\nt=11, y=6, safe, a_11 = U\n\nt=12, y=7, safe, a_12 = U\n\nt=13, y=8, safe, a_13 = U\n\nThen at t=14, y=9, done.\n\nSo H=5, actions: U,U,U,U,U for t=9 to 13.\n\nt=9 to t=13 is 5 actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=12, y=7 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe only at T=16,17,18, which are turns 16,17,18, since t_1=9.\n\nt=12 is before, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there any car that might affect earlier? For example, on freeway 7, the first car at Δt=7, which is T=16.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should think if we need to wait for some reason.\n\nAnother thing: the player is at (0,4) at t=9, and we move up immediately.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 8, same.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but y=4 to y=9, delta y=5, so min 5 actions if all U.\n\nIf we go down, it takes more.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7, it has multiple cars, but only one is relevant.\n\nIn the output, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut the turn is given as t_1=9, so actions from t_1.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H - 1\n\nWith H minimal.\n\nIn this case, H=5, so actions at t=9,10,11,12,13.\n\na_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U\n\nThen at t=14, y=9.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 at t=12.\n\nt=12, Δt=12-9=3\n\nFor freeway 7, first car: min = τ + sΔt = -39 + 4*3 = -39 +12 = -27? Earlier for coverage.\n\nAt Δt=3, T=12, min = -39 + 4*3 = -39+12= -27, max= -28 +12= -16? h=-28, s=4, max = h + sΔt = -28 + 12 = -16\n\nSpan [-27,-16]? min= τ + sΔt = -39 + 4*3 = -39+12= -27\n\nmax= h + sΔt = -28 + 12 = -16\n\nSo [-27,-16], which is all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not covering.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, y=8, freeway 8, same as above, at Δt=4, T=13, min=-39+16= -23? -39 + 4*4 = -39+16= -23, max=-28+16= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt t=14, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we reach at t=14, after 5 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to reach in fewer than 5 actions? No, because from y=4, need to increase to y=9, min 5 steps.\n\nUnless we start from y=4 and go directly, but no, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, at t=9, we are at y=4, and we can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf we stay at t=9, y=4, then we need to move later, which might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at t=9, then at t=10, y=4, then move up, but at t=10, freeway 4 is still safe, but we lose a turn.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is to go straight up.\n\nBut let me check if at t=10, when we are on freeway 5, is it safe? Freeway 5 has car similar to freeway 4, (24,1,right,24), span [1 +24Δt, 24+24Δt], min>0, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, it is (24,1,right,24), same as freeway 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem has freeway 7 and 8 with cars that are unsafe at later times, but we avoid them by not being there at those times.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay longer on some freeway, but in this path, we don't stay.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, for example, if at some turn we are on a freeway that is unsafe, but in this case, all are safe at the times we are there.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1,2,3 at t=10 unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nSo I think the sequence is valid.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, position (0,9)\n\nH=5.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the current turn is t_1=9, and player position (0,4).\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car (12,1,right,4), but at t=9, for freeway 7, this car span [1,12] at t=9, which is [1,12], 0 not in, and at later times, min=1+4Δt>0, so never covers 0, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think no issue.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5, with sequence U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so I need to output H and the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the actions, not H explicitly, but H is implied.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo for this, t_1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThat should be it.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of actions.\n\nFrom t=9 to t=13, 5 actions, to reach at t=14.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at t_1 + H -1 =13, so H=5.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a reason to use S or D? For example, if we were forced to avoid something, but in this case, not.\n\nPerhaps at t=10, if we were on freeway 1, but we are not.\n\nAnother thought: the player starts at y=4 at t=9, and we move to y=5 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, freeway 1 is unsafe, but we are on freeway 5, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 or something, but that would take longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=3 at t=10, then we need more steps to go up, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, staying also worse.\n\nSo minimal is 5.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 4: (24,1,right,24), at t=9, span [1,24], 0 not covered.\n\nIf we stay at y=4, at t=10, Δt=1, span [1+24,24+24]=[25,48], 0 not covered, safe.\n\nBut we don't need to stay.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with braces.\n\nIn the example, it has a_{t_1}, so probably with subscript.\n\nBut in text, we can write Turn 9: U, etc.\n\nI think for the box, we can write as above.\n\nSince t_1=9, we can write explicitly.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Freeways\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 10\\) (i.e., when \\(\\Delta t = T - 9 = 1\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) are always safe, as no car covers position \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7, 8\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = 7, 8, 9\\)).\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are not freeways and are always safe.\n\n### Optimal Path\nThe player starts at \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(t = 9\\). To minimize \\(H\\), the player should move up (U) as much as possible, as each U action increases \\(y\\) by 1. The target is \\(y = 9\\), which requires a minimum of 5 upward moves from \\(y = 4\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions and positions is as follows:\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), position is (0, 4). Action \\(a_9 = U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 10\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), position is (0, 5). Action \\(a_{10} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 11\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\), position is (0, 6). Action \\(a_{11} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 12\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\), position is (0, 7). Action \\(a_{12} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 13\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 13\\), position is (0, 8). Action \\(a_{13} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 14\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification\n- Turn \\(t = 9\\): Player is on freeway \\(y = 4\\), which is safe.\n- Turn \\(t = 10\\): Player is on freeway \\(y = 5\\), which is safe (freeways 1, 2, 3 are unsafe at \\(t = 10\\), but player is not on them).\n- Turn \\(t = 11\\): Player is on freeway \\(y = 6\\), which is safe.\n- Turn \\(t = 12\\): Player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is unsafe at \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\), but \\(t = 12\\) is not in that range, so safe.\n- Turn \\(t = 13\\): Player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is unsafe at \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\), but \\(t = 13\\) is not in that range, so safe.\n- Turn \\(t = 14\\): Player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe.\n\nThis path reaches (0, 9) in 5 turns (\\(H = 5\\)) with no collisions. Since moving up directly requires exactly 5 actions and avoids all unsafe freeways at the relevant times, this is minimal. Staying (S) or moving down (D) would increase \\(H\\), so they are not optimal.\n\n### Output\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 9\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13\\) is all U actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 10. The player starts at (0,5) and wants to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nWe note that collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn T, and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant: The player updates position at the next turn. So at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action (U, D, S) and at turn T+1 the player is at y_{T+1}. Also note that when moving, the player is only on one freeway per turn. And when moving from y to y+1 (or y-1), during the turn T the player is on y, and at turn T+1 they are on y+1 (or y-1). So at the moment of the move (during turn T) they are still on the original row.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions from turn 10 (t1) to turn 10+H-1 (so H turns) such that at turn 10+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nWe note that the grid has y=0 to y=9. The player starts at y=5 and must get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 4 moves upward (H=4). However, we must avoid collisions on the freeways (y=1 to 8) at each turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn 10. For each car, we know:\n  freeway k (which is the row), and then a list of cars on that row. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nNote: The representation of the car span and the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving (which we don't have in this case, all are right-moving?):\n  Actually, the direction is given as 'right'. For right-moving cars, the update rule is:\n    At turn T, the car span is [tau, h] (so tail at tau, head at h) and at time T (relative to t1, which is 10) we have:\n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]\n\nBut note: the description says for T > t1. So at turn T (global turn), the span is computed by moving the car by s*(T-t1).\n\nIn our case, the cars are all right-moving.\n\nWe must check for each freeway (row) that the player is on at turn T (from turn 10 onwards) that the player's x-coordinate (0) is not in the span of any car on that row at that turn.\n\nLet me write down the car configurations for each freeway at turn 10:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (24, -11, right, 36) -> at turn 10: the car is from -11 to 24? But note the representation for right-moving: the head is 24 and tail is -11? Actually the table says \"head h, tail tau\", and then for right-moving the span is [tau, h]? But in the update rule for right-moving, the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] and then it moves. However, the given data is (h, tau, d, s). So for freeway1: h=24, tau=-11, d=right, s=36.\n\nSo at turn 10, the car on freeway1 is at [ -11, 24 ]? But the update rule for right-moving says: \n  initial span at t1 is [tau, h] -> so [ -11, 24 ].\n\nBut then at a future turn T (>=10), the car will be at [ -11 + 36*(T-10), 24 + 36*(T-10) ].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: [ -11, 24 ] at turn10, and then [ -11+36*(T-10), 24+36*(T-10) ] at turn T.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 25, right, 24) -> at turn10: [25, 48] (since for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [25,48]? But the data is given as (head, tail) = (48,25). So the tail is 25 and head is 48? Then the car is from 25 to 48? Then at turn T: [25+24*(T-10), 48+24*(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 5 and 6: same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: each has three cars. For freeway7: \n  car1: (-24, -35, right, 4) -> at turn10: [-35, -24] (because tail=-35, head=-24) -> then at T: [-35+4*(T-10), -24+4*(T-10)]\n  car2: (52, 41, right, 4) -> at turn10: [41,52] -> then at T: [41+4*(T-10), 52+4*(T-10)]\n  car3: (16,5,right,4) -> at turn10: [5,16] -> then at T: [5+4*(T-10), 16+4*(T-10)]\n\nSame for freeway8.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn10 at y=5. We need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 10, 11, 12, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe note that the player can only move one step at a time (or stay). We are to minimize the number of turns.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that row at that same turn T.\n\nWe can simulate turn by turn. We start at turn10 at y=5. We then choose an action for turn10, which will determine y11. Then at turn11 we are at y11, and so on.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn10 to the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we prefer going up as much as possible. But we might have to wait (S) or even go down to avoid collisions.\n\nHowever, note that the goal is at y=9, and we start at y=5. We have to cover 4 steps upward. But we can also move down or stay.\n\nWe are going to simulate the turns and check for collisions.\n\nLet me denote T0 = 10.\n\nAt turn T (>=10), the player is at y_T. We must check if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as much as possible, but if at a turn we would be on a row that has a car covering x=0 at that turn, then we cannot be there. So we might have to choose a different action (like stay or down) to avoid that.\n\nWe note that we can also plan to wait until the cars have passed.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, we will try to go up unless blocked.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at different turns.\n\nFirst, note that the cars on freeways 1,2,3: they are moving right at speed 36. The car at turn10 is from -11 to 24. The car covers 35 units (from -11 to 24). The speed is 36 per turn. So at turn10: the car is at [-11,24]. Then:\n\nAt turn T: [ -11 + 36*(T-10), 24 + 36*(T-10) ]\n\nWe are concerned with when 0 is in this interval.\n\nSolve: -11 + 36*(T-10) <= 0 <= 24 + 36*(T-10)\n\nBut note: the interval is [A, B] = [ -11+36*(T-10), 24+36*(T-10) ]\n\nSo 0 is in [A, B] if A <= 0 and 0 <= B.\n\nBut note that the car is moving to the right, so for T>=10, the entire car is moving to the right.\n\nAt T=10: A = -11, B=24 -> 0 is in [-11,24] -> yes.\n\nBut at T=10, the player is at y=5. So we must check freeway5? Actually, at turn10, the player is at y=5, so we check freeway5? But note: the freeways are from 1 to 8. And the player is at y=5, which is freeway5? Actually, the freeways are labeled by the row: so row 1, row2,...,row8. So if the player is at y=5, then we are on freeway5.\n\nBut wait: the grid has y=0,1,...,9. The freeways are on y=1 to y=8. So y=0 and y=9 are not freeways? And the player can be at y=0 or y=9 without worrying about cars? Exactly: the collision condition only applies when the player is on a freeway (y from 1 to 8). At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars.\n\nSo at turn10, the player is at y=5 (freeway5). We must check the cars on freeway5 at turn10.\n\nFreeway5: one car: (48,25,right,24) -> so at turn10: the car is at [25,48]? (because for right-moving: [tail, head] = [25,48]). Then 0 is in [25,48]? No, because 0<25. So no collision at turn10 on freeway5.\n\nBut wait: the car representation for freeway5: the given data is (head, tail) = (48,25). And the update rule for right-moving says: the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] = [25,48]. So yes, at turn10, the car is at [25,48]. So 0 is not in that interval. So safe.\n\nNow, what about other freeways? We are only concerned with the freeway we are on. So at turn10, we are safe.\n\nWe choose an action at turn10. We want to go up. So we try a_{10} = U.\n\nThen at turn11, the player will be at y=6.\n\nBut we must check: during turn10, we are at y=5 (so we already did that and it was safe). Then at turn11, we will be at y=6.\n\nNow, at turn11, we are on freeway6? So we check freeway6 at turn11.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? It has the same car: (48,25,right,24) -> at turn11 (T=11): \n  The car moves: [25 + 24*(11-10), 48+24*(11-10)] = [25+24, 48+24] = [49,72]. 0 is not in [49,72]. So safe.\n\nBut wait: we are at turn11 at y=6. We then choose an action for turn11. We want to go up again: a_{11}=U. Then at turn12 we are at y=7.\n\nNow at turn12, we are at y=7. Check freeway7 at turn12.\n\nFreeway7 has three cars. We must check each one at turn12 (T=12).\n\nCar1: (-24, -35, right, 4) -> at turn10: [-35, -24]. At turn12: \n  [-35 + 4*(12-10), -24 + 4*(12-10)] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27, -16] -> 0 is not in [-27,-16] (since 0 is positive).\n\nCar2: (52,41,right,4) -> at turn10: [41,52]. At turn12: [41+8, 52+8] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nCar3: (16,5,right,4) -> at turn10: [5,16]. At turn12: [5+8, 16+8] = [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at turn12.\n\nThen we choose a_{12}=U. Then at turn13 we are at y=8.\n\nAt turn13, we are at y=8. Check freeway8 at turn13.\n\nFreeway8: same cars as freeway7? The table says for freeway8: same three cars.\n\nCar1: (-24,-35,right,4) -> at turn13: [-35+4*(13-10), -24+4*(13-10)] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in.\n\nCar2: (52,41,right,4) -> [41+12,52+12] = [53,64] -> 0 not in.\n\nCar3: (16,5,right,4) -> [5+12,16+12] = [17,28] -> 0 not in.\n\nSafe. Then we choose a_{13}=U. Then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn14, we are at y=9. Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), we don't check any car. And we are done.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn10: U -> to y=6 at turn11? Wait, let me correct:\n\nAt turn10: start at y=5. We do U, then at turn11 we are at y=6.\nTurn11: at y=6, do U -> turn12 at y=7.\nTurn12: at y=7, do U -> turn13 at y=8.\nTurn13: at y=8, do U -> turn14 at y=9.\n\nSo H = 4 turns (from turn10 to turn13, so actions at turn10,11,12,13). The last action at turn13 leads to y=9 at turn14. But note: we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 10+H-1) we are at y=9. So 10+H-1 = 14 => H=5? \n\nWait, let me clarify the indexing.\n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  We start at turn10 (t1=10) at y=5.\n  We take actions for t=0 to H-1 (relative to t1). So:\n    t=0: action at turn10 -> leads to y11\n    t=1: action at turn11 -> leads to y12\n    ...\n    t=H-1: action at turn10+H-1 -> leads to y_{10+H}\n\nBut we want the player to be at y=9 at turn10+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then the player update: after H actions, we have:\n  y_{t1+H} = ... ?\n\nBut note: the action a_{t} is taken at turn t, and then the next state is at turn t+1.\n\nSo:\n  At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=5.\n  Then we apply a_{t1} (which is the first action) -> then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}.\n  Then a_{t1+1} -> y_{t1+2}\n  ...\n  Then a_{t1+H-1} -> y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\nRe-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then at that same turn? Or after the action?\n\nActually, the player update rule: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and the action a_t is taken at turn t.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then we choose a_t. Then at the beginning of turn t+1, the player is at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, after taking action at turn t1+H-1, the player moves to y_{t1+H} at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the turn when we take the last action) the player is at (0,9)? That doesn't match because at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}, and then we take an action and move to y_{t1+H}. \n\nAlternatively, the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). So that means the player is at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we take an action at that turn? But then the next state would be at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9). So we want the player to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn. \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo we are done at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, so we take H actions.\n\nBut if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to move? However, the problem says we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? But if we are at 9 and we take an action, we might move to 10? But y is bounded to [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, we stay at 9? Or the problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, we stay at 9? \n\nBut note the problem: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and then clipped to [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, then y_{t+1} = min(9, 9+1)=9.\n\nSo we can take an action at turn t1+H-1 even if we are at 9. But we don't need to: we could just not take an extra action. However, the problem says we take H actions and at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? Then we must take an action at that turn? That would be the last action.\n\nAlternatively, it might be that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that leaves us at 9 at the next turn? But the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the requirement is: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). Then we take an action at that turn? But that action might move us? However, the problem does not require that we remain at 9 after that action. It only requires that we are at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: if we are at a freeway at the beginning of a turn, then we check for collision. Since 9 is not a freeway, we are safe. Then we take an action. But the action might move us to 8? or 10? but 10 is clipped to 9. So we would be at 9 again. But the goal is already achieved at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So we are done at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1? But we don't need to move? We can take any action? But then the problem requires a sequence of actions. \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is defined for t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. So we are at 9 at the start of that turn. Then we take the last action at that turn. Since we are already at 9, we can choose S (stay) or U (which would leave us at 9) or D (which would go to 8, but then we wouldn't be at 9 at the beginning of that turn? Wait, no: we are at 9 at the beginning, then we take an action. So if we take D, then we go to 8 at the next turn. But the goal is achieved at the beginning of that turn, so we don't care what happens after? Actually, the goal is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action and then the game continues? But we are only required to be at 9 at that turn. So we can take any action? However, we must avoid collisions during the entire sequence. But after we are at 9, we are safe because 9 is not a freeway.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. At turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 (not a freeway) so no collision. Then we take an action and then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about after? The goal is only to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we don't care what happens at turn t1+H? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then the collisions must be avoided during the entire sequence. The collisions are checked at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? Because we are present at the grid at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 (not a freeway) so no collision. The previous turns: we are on freeways 5,6,7,8 at turns 10,11,12,13? \n\nIn our plan:\n\nTurn10: at y=5 -> freeway5: safe (as we checked)\nTurn11: at y=6 -> freeway6: safe\nTurn12: at y=7 -> freeway7: safe\nTurn13: at y=8 -> freeway8: safe\nTurn14: we don't have turn14? Because at the beginning of turn13 (which is t1+3) we are at y=8. Then we take an action at turn13 (which is the 4th action) and then at turn14 we are at y=9. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 10+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nIn our plan, at the beginning of turn10: y=5\nturn11: y=6\nturn12: y=7\nturn13: y=8\nturn14: y=9\n\nSo we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn14. So we want 10+H-1 = 14 -> H=5.\n\nBut then we must have taken 5 actions? From turn10 to turn14? But we only took 4 actions: at turn10,11,12,13.\n\nThe problem: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, so the turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is the last turn we take an action) the player is at (0,9). But in our case, at the last action (turn13) we are at y=8 at the beginning of turn13, then we take U and then at turn14 we are at y=9. So at the beginning of turn13, we are at 8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, we are not at 9 at the beginning of turn13. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn14.\n\nSo to have the player at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn 10+H-1. \n\nWe want 10+H-1 = 14 -> H=5? Then we are at 9 at turn14? Then the actions are taken at turns 10,11,12,13,14? But then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn14, then we take an action at turn14? But we are already at 9. So we can take any action? But we don't need to move.\n\nAlternatively, we could reach 9 earlier? But we only have 4 moves up. So we need at least 4 actions to go from 5 to 9.\n\nSo with 4 actions: \n  We start at turn10: y10=5\n  After a10 (U): y11=6\n  After a11 (U): y12=7\n  After a12 (U): y13=8\n  After a13 (U): y14=9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn14, we are at y=9. So we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 10+H-1. So 10+H-1=14 -> H=5.\n\nTherefore, we need H=5. The actions are for turns 10,11,12,13,14? But we have only 4 actions that change the state. We need a fifth action? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions has H actions. So we take 5 actions. The first four are U, and then the last one? We can be at 9 at the beginning of turn14 (which is t1+4) so 10+4=14. Then H-1=4? So H=5. Then the last action is at turn14 (t1+4). At the beginning of turn14, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn14. We can take S (stay) or U (which stays) or D (which goes to 8). But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn14, so we have achieved the goal at that turn. Then we take an action? But the problem requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, which is turn14. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn14, then we take the fifth action (at turn14). So we must output 5 actions.\n\nBut we only need to move 4 times. The fifth action is redundant? But we have to output H=5 actions. And we are at 9 at the beginning of the last action's turn (turn14). So we can choose any action for turn14? Since we are at 9 and not on a freeway, and we are already at the goal at the beginning of that turn, we can choose S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: S   (or U or D? but D would move us down to 8 at turn15, but we are done at turn14. However, the collision avoidance is only for the turns we are on freeways. At turn14, we are at y=9 (not freeway) so no collision. But we don't care about the state after? The problem only requires we avoid collisions during the turns we are on the grid? And we are at turn14 at y=9, so no collision. Then we take an action: if we take D, then at turn15 we are at y=8. But we are not required to be at 9 at turn15. So we can take any action? However, to be safe, we can take S.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars\" at every turn we are on a freeway. At turn14 we are at y=9 (not freeway) so no collision. Then we take an action and then at turn15 we are at y=8? But we are not required to avoid collisions after the goal? The goal is achieved at turn14 (the beginning). The actions we take at turn14 might lead to a collision at turn15? But the problem doesn't say we have to avoid collisions after we reach the goal. It only says \"to reach (0,9)\" and then during the sequence? The sequence of actions is from turn10 to turn14 (5 actions). The state during the sequence: we are at the grid at turns10,11,12,13,14. At turn14 we are at y=9 (safe). Then we take an action, but that action leads to the next state at turn15, which is beyond the last turn of the sequence? The sequence of actions is defined for the turns we are taking the actions, and we are only responsible for the collisions at the turns we are present? Specifically, the collision condition is checked at each turn T for which we are on a freeway. And we are only present at turns from 10 to 14? \n\nBut at the beginning of turn14 we are at y=9. Then we take an action. The action changes the state for the next turn (turn15). But we are not present at turn15? The problem does not require us to be present at turn15. So we don't care about turn15. So we can take any action at turn14? \n\nHowever, to be safe, we can just take S. \n\nSo the plan: 4 U's and then one S at the end.\n\nBut wait: we only need 4 moves to get to 9, but we have to account for the goal being at the beginning of the last turn. So we need to be at 9 at the beginning of the last action's turn. Therefore, we must have the last action taken when we are already at 9? So we need to get to 9 one turn earlier? But we cannot get to 9 in 3 moves? Because 5 to 9 is 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, we can get to 9 in 4 moves, but then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn14. Then we take an action at turn14 (which is the fifth action). So we must have H=5.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5? But is there a way with H=4? That would mean we are at 9 at the beginning of turn13 (because t1+H-1=10+4-1=13). \n\nBut to be at 9 at the beginning of turn13, we must have moved from 5 to 9 in 3 moves? That's impossible because each move up only increases by 1. So we need at least 4 moves. Therefore, H cannot be 4. So H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check: if we start at turn10: y=5.\nWe take U at turn10: at turn11, y=6.\nU at turn11: turn12, y=7.\nU at turn12: turn13, y=8.\nThen at turn13, we are at y=8. To be at 9 at the beginning of turn13, we are not. We are at 8.\n\nSo we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14. So H=5.\n\nTherefore, we output 5 actions: U, U, U, U, and then at turn14 we are at 9 and we take S.\n\nBut we must check the entire path for collisions.\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn10: at y=5 -> freeway5: car at [25+24*(10-10)=25,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn11 we are at y=6.\n\nTurn11: at y=6 -> freeway6: same car: at turn11: [25+24,48+24]=[49,72] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn12 we are at y=7.\n\nTurn12: at y=7 -> freeway7: three cars at turn12 (T=12):\n  car1: [-35+4*(12-10), -24+4*(12-10)] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n  car2: [41+8,52+8]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  car3: [5+8,16+8]=[13,24] -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn13 we are at y=8.\n\nTurn13: at y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7 but at turn13 (T=13):\n  car1: [-35+4*(13-10), -24+4*(13-10)] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  car2: [41+12,52+12]=[53,64] -> safe.\n  car3: [5+12,16+12]=[17,28] -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\nTurn14: at y=9 -> not a freeway, so no collision check. We are at the goal at the beginning of this turn. Then we take an action: we choose S (stay). Then we remain at 9 at turn15, but we don't care.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: S\n\nBut wait: at turn14, we are at y=9 at the beginning. Then we take S. Then at turn15 we are still at 9. But we are only required to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14 (which is t1+4, and t1+H-1=10+5-1=14). So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn14, so goal achieved. Then we take the action at turn14 (which is S) to complete the sequence.\n\nIs there a problem? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". We reach (0,9) at turn14 (the beginning) and then we take the action S. That is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we could also take U at turn14: then we try to go to 10, but then we are clipped to 9. So same as S. Or D: then we go to 8 at turn15. But we are not responsible for turn15.\n\nSo we can choose any. But to be safe, we choose S.\n\nBut wait: what if we take D at turn14? Then at turn15 we are at 8. But we are not required to avoid collisions after turn14? The problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways\" during the entire sequence of actions. The sequence of actions is taken at turns10 to14. The state during these actions: we are present at turns10,11,12,13,14. At turn14, we are at y=9 (safe). The action at turn14 is taken, and then we move to turn15, but we are not present at turn15 in the context of the sequence? The sequence ends at the last action (turn14). The collision condition is checked at the turn when we are present. We are present at turn14 (at y=9) and we are safe. The move to turn15 is beyond the sequence. So we don't care.\n\nTherefore, we can output:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: S   (or even U or D, but S is safe and simple)\n\nBut let me check if there is a problem with the car on freeway8 at turn14? But we are at y=9 at turn14, so we don't check freeway8. Then we take an action and move to turn15. At turn15 we are at y=8 if we take D? But we are not required to avoid collisions at turn15 because our sequence only covers up to turn14. So it's okay.\n\nBut to be clean, we choose S.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that we are not forced to avoid collisions at turn15? The problem doesn't specify. It only says \"avoid collisions\" during the game to reach the goal. Since we reached the goal at turn14, the subsequent action is just to complete the sequence and we don't care about the state after.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, and the sequence is four U's and one S.\n\nBut wait: we did not consider the cars on freeways 1,2,3? They never came into play because we were on freeways 5,6,7,8. But what if we had to go through other freeways? We didn't, so it's fine.\n\nBut let me double-check: is there any chance that at turn14, if we choose to go down (D) and then at turn15 we are at y=8, but we are not responsible? Yes.\n\nBut the problem might interpret that we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on the grid during the entire sequence of actions. And the entire sequence of actions leads to states from turn10 to turn14? And then the next state at turn15 is not part of the sequence? \n\nThe collision condition says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". And we are present at turn T. The turns we are present are the turns when we are taking actions? Or the turns from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nWe are present at the beginning of each turn from turn10 to turn14. Then we take an action at that turn, and then we move to the next turn. The collision check is at the beginning of the turn (before the action). So at the beginning of turn14, we are at y=9 -> safe. Then we take an action. The action does not cause a collision at turn14 because we are not on a freeway. Then we move to the next state. But we are not present at turn15 in the sequence? The sequence ends at turn14.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut wait: the current turn is t1=10. The problem says: \"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\" and then the state at turn t1 is given. So we start at turn10.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t from 0 to H-1. So for H=5, we have t=0,1,2,3,4. So the turns: t1+0=10, t1+1=11, t1+2=12, t1+3=13, t1+4=14.\n\nSo the above output.\n\nBut is there a problem at any turn? We checked the freeways we were on: 5,6,7,8 at turns10,11,12,13 respectively. And at turn14 we are at 9. All safe.\n\nBut what about freeways 1,2,3,4? We never went there. So we don't care.\n\nBut just to be thorough: suppose at turn10 we are at y=5, and we check freeway5: safe. Then we move to y=6 at turn11: freeway6: safe. Then to 7 at turn12: freeway7: safe. Then to 8 at turn13: freeway8: safe. Then to 9 at turn14: not freeway.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, and the sequence is as above.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? That would require being at 9 at the beginning of turn13. But we can only get to 8 at the beginning of turn13 (by taking three U's: 5->6 at turn11, 6->7 at turn12, 7->8 at turn13). Then at turn13 we are at 8, not 9. So we need one more U to get to 9 at turn14. Therefore, H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we go faster? We cannot: we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down? But that would take more turns.\n\nSo the above is minimal.\n\nBut wait: the freeway7 and 8 have cars that are moving. At turn12 and turn13 we checked and they were safe. But what about if we wait? We don't need to wait because they are safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=5. And 5 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we could not take the last action? But the problem says we must output a sequence of H actions. And we are required to have H actions.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut let me check freeway7 and 8 again at the turns we are there.\n\nAt turn12 (T=12) for freeway7:\n  car1: [-35+4*(12-10), -24+4*(12-10)] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27, -16] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [41+8,52+8] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n  car3: [5+8,16+8] = [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn13 (T=13) for freeway8:\n  car1: [-35+4*(13-10), -24+4*(13-10)] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  car2: [41+12,52+12] = [53,64] -> safe.\n  car3: [5+12,16+12] = [17,28] -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nOne more: at turn14, if we had to be on a freeway? But we are at 9.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 5. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn.\n\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). The car on freeway 5 (row 5) at turn 10 is at \\([25, 48]\\) (since it is right-moving with speed 24, and the span is \\([25 + 24 \\times (10-10), 48 + 24 \\times (10-10)] = [25, 48]\\)). The player's x-coordinate 0 is not in this interval, so it is safe. Action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 6\\). The car on freeway 6 at turn 11 is at \\([25 + 24 \\times (11-10), 48 + 24 \\times (11-10)] = [49, 72]\\). 0 is not in this interval, so safe. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 has three cars:\n  - Car 1: \\([-35 + 4 \\times (12-10), -24 + 4 \\times (12-10)] = [-27, -16]\\)\n  - Car 2: \\([41 + 4 \\times (12-10), 52 + 4 \\times (12-10)] = [49, 60]\\)\n  - Car 3: \\([5 + 4 \\times (12-10), 16 + 4 \\times (12-10)] = [13, 24]\\)\n  0 is not in any of these intervals, so safe. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 has three cars:\n  - Car 1: \\([-35 + 4 \\times (13-10), -24 + 4 \\times (13-10)] = [-23, -12]\\)\n  - Car 2: \\([41 + 4 \\times (13-10), 52 + 4 \\times (13-10)] = [53, 64]\\)\n  - Car 3: \\([5 + 4 \\times (13-10), 16 + 4 \\times (13-10)] = [17, 28]\\)\n  0 is not in any interval, so safe. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, the player is at \\(y = 9\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), no collision check is needed. The player has reached the goal at the beginning of turn 14. Action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen to complete the sequence, leaving the player at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15 (beyond the required sequence).\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H = 5\\) and ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 14 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 5 - 1 = 14\\)) while avoiding collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=11, and I start at y=6. I can move up, down, or stay each turn, but y has to stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each has a head, tail, direction, and speed. Collision happens if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I don't collide if I'm moving between rows.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each future turn relative to t=11.\n\nLet t be the number of turns after t1. So at t=0, it's turn 11, I'm at y=6.\n\nI need to find actions for t=0 to t=H-1 such that at turn t1 + (H-1), y =9.\n\nSince I start at y=6 and need to get to y=9, I need to go up 3 rows. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 3.\n\nThe minimal H might be 3 if I can go straight up without colliding.\n\nBut I need to check if at each step, when I'm on a freeway, 0 is not in the car span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=0 (turn 11).\n\nFreeway 1: (head=60, tail=25, direction=right, speed=36)\n\nSince direction is right, head > tail, I assume? Head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it says [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nLook: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1=11, for each car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: direction right, so span at t1: [tail, head] = [25, 60], speed 36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as 1? It says (60,25,right,36) so same as 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also (60,25,right,36)\n\nAll the same? Let's see:\n\n| 1 | (60, 25, right, 36) |\n\n| 2 | (60, 25, right, 36) |\n\n| 3 | (60, 25, right, 36) |\n\n| 4 | (72, 49, right, 24) | head=72, tail=49, right, speed=24\n\n| 5 | (72, 49, right, 24) | same\n\n| 6 | (72, 49, right, 24) | same\n\n| 7 | (-20, -31, right, 4), (56, 45, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4) | three cars\n\n| 8 | (-20, -31, right, 4), (56, 45, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4) | same as 7\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFor freeway 7: three cars: car A: head=-20, tail=-31, right, speed=4\n\nBut head and tail, for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Here head=-20, tail=-31, so -20 > -31, so span is [tail, head] = [-31, -20]? Or [head, tail]?\n\nFrom the rule: for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSo for car on freeway 7: first car: tail τ=-31, head h=-20, so span at t1: [-31, -20]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=45, h=56, span [45,56]\n\nThird car: τ=9, h=20, span [9,20]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars.\n\nNow, at a future turn T, which is turn number, but since t1=11, let τ = T - t1, so time elapsed.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, when I am at position y_T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, I need that for the freeway k=y_T, 0 is not in any car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe span at turn T for a car: for right-moving, span = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] where τ = T - t1\n\nSimilarly for left, but here all cars are right-moving, no left-moving in this case.\n\nAll directions are right, so only right-moving cars.\n\nSo general: for a car with tail τ_t1, head h_t1, right, speed s, at time Δt after t1, position is increased by s * Δt.\n\nSo span at turn T = t1 + Δt is [τ_t1 + s Δt, h_t1 + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left, but no left here.\n\nNow, collision if I am on row k at turn T, and 0 is in [τ_t1 + s Δt, h_t1 + s Δt] for some car on row k.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need for all cars on that row, 0 not in their span.\n\nBut since the row might have multiple cars, I need that 0 is not in any of their spans.\n\nNow, for each freeway, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ=25, h=60, s=36\n\nFreeway 2: same, τ=25, h=60, s=36\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: τ=49, h=72, s=24\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n\nCar1: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4\n\nCar2: τ=45, h=56, s=4\n\nCar3: τ=9, h=20, s=4\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, I start at y=6 at t=0 (turn 11).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so when I'm at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9), so when I arrive at y=9, I'm safe.\n\nBut during the journey, when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid cars.\n\nNow, minimal H: since I need to go from 6 to 9, that's +3, so at least 3 turns if I go up each time.\n\nCan I go up directly?\n\nLet me see if at turn 11, y=6, is it safe? But I'm at y=6 now, turn 11, and I will move at turn 11 to go to y=7 or whatever.\n\nThe collision is checked when I am on the freeway at turn T.\n\nAt the start of turn T, I am at position y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the collision is based on y_T and the car positions at turn T.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is my position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on row y_T. I perform action, which may change my row to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked based on y_T and cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nIf I stay or move, as long as at turn T, on row y_T, 0 is not in any car span for that row at T.\n\nThen, after action, I move to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at (0,6), so y_{t1} =6.\n\nI choose a_{t1}, which could be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_{t1+1} =7\n\nIf S, y_{t1+1} =6\n\nIf D, y_{t1+1} =5\n\nBut at turn t1, when I am at y=6, I need to check if it's safe, meaning for freeway 6, is 0 not in the car spans at turn t1.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars: from above, freeway 6 has (72,49,right,24) but that's one car? No, freeway 6: | 6 | (72, 49, right, 24) | so one car with τ=49, h=72, s=24.\n\nAt turn t1=11, Δt=0, span = [49,72]\n\n0 is not in [49,72], since 49>0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, but at turn t1, I am on y=6, so only need to check y=6.\n\nSince 0 not in [49,72], it's safe to be here.\n\nNow, I want to go to y=9.\n\nShortest way: go up three times.\n\nBut I need to check if when I am on each row at each turn, it's safe.\n\nSo, suppose I go U at turn 11: to y=7 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 11: I am on y=6, action U, so y_{12}=7\n\nAt turn 11, I am on y=6, which we saw is safe.\n\nNow at turn 12: I am on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: car1: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4\n\ncar2: τ=45, h=56, s=4\n\ncar3: τ=9, h=20, s=4\n\nAt turn 12, Δt = T - t1 = 12 - 11 =1\n\nSo spans:\n\ncar1: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-31 + 4*1, -20 + 4*1] = [-27, -16]\n\n0 not in [-27,-16]\n\ncar2: [45 + 4*1, 56 + 4*1] = [49,60], 0 not in\n\ncar3: [9 + 4*1, 20 + 4*1] = [13,24], 0 not in\n\nSo all good, no car has 0 in span, so safe to be on y=7 at turn 12.\n\nThen, if I go U again at turn 12, to y=8 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 12: on y=7, action U, y_{13}=8\n\nAt turn 12, we just saw y=7 is safe.\n\nThen turn 13: on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7: cars with same positions at t1, but since same, at Δt=2 (turn 13 -11=2)\n\nT=13, t1=11, Δt=2\n\nSpans for freeway 8:\n\ncar1: [-31 + 4*2, -20 + 4*2] = [-31+8, -20+8] = [-23, -12], 0 not in\n\ncar2: [45+8, 56+8] = [53,64], 0 not in\n\ncar3: [9+8, 20+8] = [17,28], 0 not in\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen at turn 13, I go U to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 13: on y=8, action U, y_{14}=9\n\nAt turn 13, y=8 is safe as above.\n\nThen at turn 14, I am on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, safe. And I reached (0,9).\n\nSo with H=3 turns, I can go from y=6 to y=9 in three steps: U at t1, U at t1+1, U at t1+2.\n\nt1=11, so actions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, I am at y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, and the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so for H=3, actions at t=0,1,2: turn 11,12,13, and after that, at turn 14, position is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach, so after H actions, we are at the target.\n\nStart at turn t1, after 0 actions, at (0,6)\n\nAfter first action (t1), at new position, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after a_{t1 + H-1}, position is (0,9).\n\nSo for H=3, actions at turn t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nAfter a_{t1+2}, position is y=9 at turn t1+3.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt time t, before action, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, perform a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t and cars at t.\n\nWe start at turn t1, y_{t1} =6.\n\nWe perform a_{t1}, go to y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen perform a_{t1+1}, go to y_{t1+2}, and so on, until we reach y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe last action is a_{t1 + H -1}, which brings us to y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn terms of turns, we need H actions.\n\nFor minimal H, if I can reach in 3 actions.\n\nIn my plan:\n\nAt turn 11: y=6, perform U, go to y=7 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12: y=7, perform U, go to y=8 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13: y=8, perform U, go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nSo after three actions, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nAnd we checked:\n\n- At turn 11, on y=6: cars on y=6: span [49,72] at t=11, 0 not in, safe.\n\n- At turn 12, on y=7: cars as above, spans at t=12: [-27,-16], [49,60], [13,24], 0 not in any, safe.\n\n- At turn 13, on y=8: spans at t=13: Δt=2, [-23,-12], [53,64], [17,28], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 14, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere H=3, actions at turn 11,12,13.\n\nBut is y=9 reached at turn 14? Yes.\n\nBut the position after last action is y=9.\n\nIn the collision, at turn 13, I was on y=8, which is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm for freeway 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 6 at turn 11: we have car with τ=49, h=72, s=24, Δt=0, [49,72], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 12: Δt=1 for t=12, t1=11.\n\nCars: car1: [-31 +4*1, -20+4*1] = [-27,-16]\n\ncar2: [45+4,56+4]=[49,60]\n\ncar3: [9+4,20+4]=[13,24]\n\n0 not in any.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 at turn 13: Δt=2\n\ncar1: [-31+8, -20+8]=[-23,-12]\n\ncar2: [45+8,56+8]=[53,64]\n\ncar3: [9+8,20+8]=[17,28]\n\nAll good.\n\nBut freeway 8 has the same cars as 7, but at different time.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut is there any problem? The cars on other rows might affect, but since I only care about the row I'm on at that turn, and I was only on y=6,7,8 at turns 11,12,13 respectively.\n\nAt turn 11, on y=6; turn 12 on y=7; turn 13 on y=8.\n\nNo other rows.\n\nAnd y=9 at turn 14 is safe.\n\nSo with H=3, it seems possible.\n\nBut let me check if at any point 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on freeway 7, at some time, might a car cover 0?\n\nBut in this path, I'm on y=7 only at turn 12, and at that time, no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut perhaps for minimality, H=3 should be possible.\n\nBut let me see the cars on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor example, on y=7, car3 has τ=9, h=20, s=4.\n\nAt time Δt, span [9+4Δt, 20+4Δt]\n\nThis covers 0 only if 9+4Δt <= 0 <= 20+4Δt, but 9+4Δt >=9>0 for Δt>=0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [45+4Δt,56+4Δt] all positive, never covers 0.\n\ncar1: [-31+4Δt, -20+4Δt], which is negative until -20+4Δt >=0, i.e., Δt >=5.\n\nAt Δt=5, [-31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0], so 0 is included? Span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], for car1: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4.\n\nAt Δt=5, [ -31 +20, -20 +20] = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, 0 is included, since it's the head? The span is inclusive, I assume.\n\n[ -11, 0 ], so 0 is the upper bound, included.\n\nSo at Δt=5, car1 on y=7 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nBut in our case, at turn 12, Δt=1, [-27,-16], not covering 0.\n\nAt turn 13, Δt=2, [-23,-12], not.\n\nBut on y=8, same cars, at Δt=2, car1: [-23,-12], not covering.\n\nNow, back to the path: with three ups, it seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in 3 turns.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I need to wait or go down.\n\nPerhaps on the way, but in this case, no.\n\nMaybe I should check the initial position.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t1=11, I am at y=6, which is freeway 6, but we saw it's safe.\n\nPerhaps for y=4,5, etc., but I don't go there.\n\nMaybe the player can go down to avoid, but here it's not necessary.\n\nSo minimal H should be 3.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nActions: Turn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, at y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it says {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{11}, t=1: a_{12}, t=2: a_{13}\n\nSo three actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=2? From y=6 to y=9 in two actions? But each action changes y by at most 1, so from 6 to 9, minimum 3 actions, since 9-6=3, and each step changes by 0 or ±1, so to increase by 3, need at least 3 up actions, no down or stay.\n\nIf I do U,U,U, y=7,8,9.\n\nIf I do S or D, I stay or go down, so it takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nBut perhaps with H=3 it is not possible due to cars, but in this case it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6 at turn 11.\n\nFreeway 6: car with τ=49, h=72, s=24, at Δt=0, [49,72], 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 11, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 12: as above, cars not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 at turn 13.\n\nBut freeway 8 has the same as 7, but at different time.\n\nAt turn 13, on y=8, Δt=2 for the cars? t1=11, turn 13 is T=13, Δt=2.\n\nCars on y=8: same as y=7 cars at t1.\n\ncar1: [-31 +4*2, -20+4*2] = [-31+8, -20+8] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\ncar2: [45+8,56+8]=[53,64]\n\ncar3: [9+8,20+8]=[17,28]\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 11, if I go to y=7 immediately, but at turn 11 I am on y=6, I can go U to y=7 for next turn.\n\nBut collision at turn 11 is on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 12 on y=7, safe.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that when I move between rows, I'm not on the new row until next turn, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, at some turns it is dangerous, but not at turn 12.\n\nFor example, at turn t1 + Δt, for freeway 7, when does car1 cover 0?\n\nAs above, at Δt=5, [ -31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=6, [-31+24, -20+24] = [-7,4], which includes 0? -7 to 4, yes, 0 is between -7 and 4.\n\nAt Δt=6, span [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, until when? When lower bound >0 or upper bound <0.\n\nLower bound: -31+4Δt >0 when 4Δt>31, Δt>7.75, so Δt>=8\n\nUpper bound: -20+4Δt <0 when 4Δt<20, Δt<5.\n\nAt Δt=5, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=6, [-7,4], 0 included.\n\nΔt=7, [-31+28, -20+28] = [-3,8], 0 included.\n\nΔt=8, [-31+32, -20+32] = [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo car1 covers 0 when Δt=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly for other cars, but they don't cover 0 except car1.\n\ncar2 and car3 are always positive.\n\nSo on freeway 7, dangerous at Δt=5,6,7, i.e., turns t1+5=16, t1+6=17, t1+7=18.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so dangerous at same Δt, turns 16,17,18.\n\nBut in our path, we are not there at those times.\n\nIn our quick path, we are on y=7 at turn 12, Δt=1, safe; y=8 at turn 13, Δt=2, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: car with τ=49, h=72, s=24.\n\nSpan [49+24Δt, 72+24Δt]\n\nLower bound 49+24Δt >=49>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4,5, same, since τ=49>0.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: τ=25>0, so never cover 0.\n\nSo only freeways 7 and 8 have cars that can cover 0, at certain times.\n\nBut in our case, we avoid those times.\n\nSo with three ups, it should be fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=6, and goes to 7,8,9.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go slower or something, but no need.\n\nMaybe the answer is simply three ups.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we already checked.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 7 has three cars, but we have the spans, and at turn 12, all spans avoid 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly, but I think it's ok.\n\nSo minimal H=3, actions: U at t11, U at t12, U at t13.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1=11.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut let me write in the boxed format.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the sequence, not explicitly H.\n\nBut in the box, it should be the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should state H.\n\nBut the format given is the sequence of actions.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut I recall that freeway 6 at turn 11 is safe, but let me see the car: (72,49,right,24), but head=72, tail=49, so at t1, [49,72], but since direction right, and moving right, positions increasing.\n\nBut 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at turn 11, I could stay or something, but no need.\n\nMaybe for y=8, at turn 13, but we saw it's fine.\n\nAnother point: when I go from y=7 to y=8 at turn 12, at turn 12 I am on y=7, perform U, go to y=8 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 12, I am on y=7, cars on y=7 at turn 12, which we checked.\n\nThen at turn 13, I am on y=8, cars on y=8 at turn 13.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, it has multiple cars listed, but we handled.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nSo for turn t1=11, actions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut in the answer, only the sequence is needed, I think.\n\nThe boxed should contain the lines.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and here t1=11.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to t1 + H -1 =11 +3 -1=13.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I need to confirm if at turn 13, after U, I go to y=9 at turn 14, which is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn 11 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 3, achieved by moving up (U) on each turn. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 11, action U moves the player to y = 7 at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, action U moves the player to y = 8 at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, action U moves the player to y = 9 at turn 14.\n\nCollision checks confirm safety at each step:\n- Turn 11 (y = 6): Freeway 6 has one car with span [49, 72] at turn 11. Since 0 is not in [49, 72], it is safe.\n- Turn 12 (y = 7): Freeway 7 has three cars at turn 12 (Δt = 1 from turn 11):\n  - Car 1: span [-31 + 4×1, -20 + 4×1] = [-27, -16]; 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: span [45 + 4×1, 56 + 4×1] = [49, 60]; 0 not in span.\n  - Car 3: span [9 + 4×1, 20 + 4×1] = [13, 24]; 0 not in span.\n  All spans avoid 0, so it is safe.\n- Turn 13 (y = 8): Freeway 8 has three cars at turn 13 (Δt = 2 from turn 11):\n  - Car 1: span [-31 + 4×2, -20 + 4×2] = [-23, -12]; 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: span [45 + 4×2, 56 + 4×2] = [53, 64]; 0 not in span.\n  - Car 3: span [9 + 4×2, 20 + 4×2] = [17, 28]; 0 not in span.\n  All spans avoid 0, so it is safe.\n\nAt turn 14, the player reaches y = 9, which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as moving from y = 6 to y = 9 requires a minimum of three upward moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,7) at turn t1=12. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. Since the player is at y=7, and needs to get to y=9, they need to move up twice, but there are cars on y=7 and y=8, so I have to be careful about when I move to avoid being on those rows when cars are present at x=0.\n\nThe collision rule: collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and for any car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn. The span is given for each car, and it moves left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nAlso, importantly, when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T, you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, and only on y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1. But the position update is: at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nLet me read the dynamics carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nWhere Δy_t depends on action at turn t.\n\nThen, \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the row at turn T.\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are only on freeway y_T, so you only check cars on that freeway for collision at that turn. When you move, at the turn you move, you're still on the old row.\n\nFor example, if at turn T you are on y, and you move up to y+1, then at turn T, you are on y, so you check cars on row y. Then at turn T+1, you are on y+1, so you check cars on row y+1.\n\nThe collision is checked based on the current position at each turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=7 at turn 12.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nTo go from y=7 to y=9, I need to increase y by 2, so at least two 'U' actions, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 2.\n\nSince I need to minimize H, I should aim for H=2 if possible, but I have to avoid collisions on row 7 and row 8 when I'm there.\n\nFirst, I need to know when cars are at x=0 on row 7 and row 8.\n\nCars are given for each freeway k=1 to 8, but since the player will be on row 7 or 8 only when moving through them, I need to consider row 7 and row 8 specifically.\n\nThe player starts on row 7 at turn 12, so I need to check if there's a collision at turn 12 on row 7.\n\nThen, depending on action, I move to row 6,7, or 8 at turn 13, and so on.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars on row 7 and row 8, since those are the rows the player might be on.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFor freeway 7: there are three cars: (-16,-27, right, 4), (60,49, right, 4), (24,13, right, 4)\n\nAll moving right, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? No, it says: for freeway 8: (-16,-27, right, 4), (60,49, right, 4), (24,13, right, 4) — identical to freeway 7?\n\nThat might be a copy-paste error, but I'll assume it's as given.\n\nNow, for each car, I need to compute when x=0 is in their span at a given turn.\n\nThe span at turn T is given based on turn t1=12.\n\nSo for any car, at turn T (relative to t1=12), the span is:\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)] but in the car update, it says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut h and τ: for left-moving, h is head, τ is tail, and since it's moving left, head is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 7 and 8, all cars are right-moving, since direction is \"right\".\n\nSo for a right-moving car, at turn t1=12, span is [τ, h], meaning τ is the left end, h is the right end, since it's moving right.\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn freeway 7, cars are given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor the first car: (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nSince direction is right, at t1=12, span is [τ, h] = [-27, -16]? Head and tail: it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ should be left, h right.\n\nHere h = -16, τ = -27, so τ = -27, h = -16, so span at t1 is [-27, -16], which is from -27 to -16, so left end -27, right end -16.\n\nThen moving right at speed 4, so at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-27 + 4*(T-12), -16 + 4*(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49, right, 4) — head 60, tail 49? But if right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [49,60] at t1.\n\nτ=49, h=60.\n\nThen at T: [49 + 4*(T-12), 60 + 4*(T-12)]\n\nThird car: (24,13, right, 4) → [13,24] at t1, then [13 + 4*(T-12), 24 + 4*(T-12)] at T.\n\nNow for freeway 8, it's the same: (-16,-27,right,4), (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4) — so identical to freeway 7.\n\nBut freeway 8 is different row, but same car positions? That might be possible, or typo, but I'll go with it.\n\nNow, for the player to have a collision on row k at turn T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that row at turn T.\n\nSo for row 7 at turn T, we have these three cars.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 12 on row 7, so we need to check if at turn 12, for row 7, is 0 in any car's span?\n\nCompute for T=12 (t1=12, so T-t1=0)\n\nFirst car: span at T=12: [-27, -16] since -27 +0 to -16+0, -27 to -16, 0 is not in this, since -27 to -16 is all negative.\n\nSecond car: [49,60] at T=12, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [13,24] at T=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 12, on row 7, no collision, since no car has 0 in span.\n\nGood, so player is safe at start.\n\nNow, the player can take actions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y goes to 8 at turn 13.\n\nIf S, y stays 7 at turn 13.\n\nIf D, y goes to 6 at turn 13.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so moving down might not help, but could be used to avoid cars if needed.\n\nSince we need to go up, and H minimal, probably best to go up directly if possible.\n\nBut we have to go through row 8 to reach row 9.\n\nRow 9 has no cars, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so once on y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 first, then move up to y=9.\n\nAt the turn we move to y=9, we are on y=8 during that turn.\n\nLet's think.\n\nAt some turn T, player is on y_T.\n\nIf action a_T = U, then y_{T+1} = y_T + 1.\n\nAt turn T, player is on y_T, so collision check on row y_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, player on y_{T+1}, check on row y_{T+1}.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need y_{T} = 8 for some T, and a_T = U, so y_{T+1} = 9.\n\nThen at turn T, player is on row 8, so we need no collision on row 8 at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, on row 9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut since we start from y=7, we need to get to y=8 first.\n\nNow, back to turn 12: player on y=7, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to choose action at turn 12.\n\nIf I do U at turn 12, then y_{13} = 8, so at turn 12, I am on row 7, action U, so I move to row 8 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 12, I am on row 7, and we saw no collision.\n\nThen at turn 13, I am on row 8, so I need to check if on row 8 at turn 13, is there collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I do S at turn 12, stay on row 7 at turn 13.\n\nOr D, go to row 6.\n\nBut going down might delay, so probably not optimal if I can go up.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go directly to row 8 at turn 13.\n\nSo action at turn 12: U.\n\nThen turn 13: position y=8.\n\nNow, at turn 13, player on row 8, need to check if 0 in any car span on row 8 at turn 13.\n\nSince freeway 8 has same cars as 7, but row 8.\n\nt1=12, T=13, so T-t1=1.\n\nFor row 8 cars: same as row 7? Freeway 8 has: (-16,-27,right,4), (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nAt turn T=13, T-t1=1.\n\nFirst car: span [τ + s(1), h + s(1)] = [-27 + 4*1, -16 + 4*1] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSecond car: [49 + 4*1, 60 + 4*1] = [53, 64], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [13 + 4*1, 24 + 4*1] = [17, 28], 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 13, on row 8, no collision.\n\nNow, at turn 13, player is on row 8, and I need to go to row 9.\n\nSo I should do U at turn 13.\n\nThen y_{14} = 9.\n\nAt turn 13, action U, so at turn 13, player is on row 8, so collision check on row 8, which we just saw is safe.\n\nThen at turn 14, player on row 9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at turn 14.\n\nH = number of turns from t1 to the turn where we reach y=9.\n\nStart at turn t1=12, position at turn 12 is (0,7).\n\nAfter action at turn 12, position at turn 13 is set.\n\nAfter action at turn 13, position at turn 14, and so on.\n\nWe reach (0,9) at some turn when y_t =9 for the first time.\n\nIn this case, if at turn 12: U, then turn 13: y=8\n\nThen at turn 13: U, then turn 14: y=9\n\nSo at turn 14, y=9, reached.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at t=t1=12, y_{12}=7.\n\nWe want y_{t} =9 for some t, with minimal t - t1.\n\nt - t1 is the number of turns after start.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t1 + k.\n\nAt turn t1, before any action, position is given.\n\nAfter action at t1, position at t1+1, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), position at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, with H=2:\n\nAction at t1=12: a_{12}\n\nThen position at t1+1=13: y_{13}\n\nThen action at t1+1=13: a_{13}\n\nPosition at t1+2=14: y_{14}\n\nSet y_{14}=9.\n\nIn the plan: if a_{12}=U, y_{13}=8\n\nThen if a_{13}=U, y_{14}=9.\n\nNow, at turn 12: on row 7, no collision as before.\n\nAt turn 13: on row 8, and we need to check for collision at turn 13.\n\nWe have for row 8 at turn 13: T=13, t1=12, T-t1=1.\n\nCars on row 8: as above, spans: [-23,-12], [53,64], [17,28], all not containing 0, so no collision.\n\nAt turn 14: on row 9, no cars, no collision.\n\nSo with H=2, it seems possible: actions U at turn 12 and U at turn 13.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we are at (0,9) at turn 14.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, but at turn 13, spans don't include 0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12 on row 7.\n\nBut freeway 7 has cars, but at turn 12, spans: for row 7 at turn 12: T=12, T-t1=0.\n\nFirst car: [-27,-16], 0 not in\n\nSecond: [49,60], 0 not in\n\nThird: [13,24], 0 not in\n\nYes.\n\nBut there are other freeways, but since we are only on row 7 and 8 during this, and rows 1-6 have cars but we won't be on them, so no need to worry.\n\nIn this path, we only visit row 7 at turn 12, row 8 at turn 13, and row 9 at turn 14.\n\nSo only need to check row 7 at turn 12 and row 8 at turn 13.\n\nBoth safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible? H=1 means only one action.\n\nIf at turn 12, action U, then y_{13}=8, which is not 9. Or S, y=7, not 9. D, y=6, not 9. So cannot reach y=9 in one action, since from 7, max to 8. So H=2 is minimum possible, and it works.\n\nBut the car state includes freeways 1 to 6, but we don't go there, so irrelevant.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but in this case, at the relevant turns, no issue.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7: at turn 12, cars: (-16,-27,right,4) so span [-27,-16]\n\n(60,49,right,4) — head 60, tail 49, so [49,60]\n\n(24,13,right,4) — [13,24]\n\nAll at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 13, for row 7: but we are not on row 7 at turn 13 if we move up.\n\nIn our plan, we are on row 7 only at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, for row 8 at turn 13: T=13, T-t1=1.\n\nCar 1: [-27 +4(1), -16 +4(1)] = [-23,-12]\n\nCar 2: [49+4, 60+4] = [53,64]\n\nCar 3: [13+4, 24+4] = [17,28]\n\n0 not in any.\n\nNow, but there is a car with head 60, tail 49, but since moving right, at T=13, [53,64], fine.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem has cars on other freeways, like freeway 4,5,6, but we don't care.\n\nIn the initial state, for freeway 7, there are three cars, but all are far from 0 at the times we care.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nBut let me see if at any time around, but since we only are on row 7 at t=12 and row 8 at t=13, and both safe, should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we stay or something, but we don't need.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7, it has (60,49,right,4), but 49 and 60, at t=12, [49,60], which is positive, and moving right, so increasing, so never near 0.\n\nSimilarly, the first car [-27,-16], moving right, so from negative to less negative, but since speed 4, it will take many turns to reach 0.\n\nFor example, to have left end at 0: for first car, τ = -27, s=4, so τ + s(T-t1) =0 when -27 +4ΔT=0, ΔT=27/4=6.75, so around turn 12+7=19, etc., far away.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nThird car [13,24] at t=12, moving right, so left end 13, which is positive, so never near 0.\n\nSo only the first car on the left might approach, but slowly.\n\nAt t=13, [-23,-12], still far.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with actions: turn 12: U, turn 13: U, we reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, but in absolute turns.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}, etc.\n\nSo for t1=12:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen after that, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut H=2, actions at t=12 and t=13.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nHere H=2, so actions at t=12 and t=13.\n\nNow, but the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 14.\n\nBut is there any reason this might not work?\n\nPerhaps I misread the car directions.\n\nAll cars on row 7 and 8 are right-moving, so moving away or towards? The first car has negative positions, moving right, so towards zero but slowly.\n\nAt t=12, span [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=13, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nEven at t=14, [-19,-8], still not 0.\n\nWhen does it hit zero? τ + sΔT =0, -27 +4ΔT=0, ΔT=27/4=6.75, so at turn 12+7=19, τ +4*7= -27+28=1, so span [1,12] or something, not including 0.\n\nSimilarly, only if exactly at 0, but since span, if 0 is endpoint, is it included?\n\nThe collision condition: \"if 0 ∈ Span(T)\", so if 0 is equal to endpoint, it is included, I think.\n\nBut in this case, for first car, at ΔT=6.75, not integer, so never exactly 0.\n\nAt ΔT=6, span [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8] at turn 18, which includes 0? -3 to 8, yes, 0 is between -3 and 8, so at turn t1+6=18, on row 7, if player is there, collision.\n\nBut we are not at turn 18, we are at turn 12 and 13, far before.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars, no issue.\n\nSo for our purpose, safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2 with actions U, U.\n\nBut the problem has cars on other rows, like freeway 4,5,6 with different speeds, but again, we don't go there.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 1,2,3 have (-48,-83,right,36), which is fast, but negative positions, moving right.\n\nAt t=12, span: for right-moving, τ=-83, h=-48, so span [-83,-48] at t=12.\n\nMoving right speed 36, so at T, [ -83 +36ΔT, -48 +36ΔT ]\n\nSet left end to 0: -83 +36ΔT=0, ΔT=83/36≈2.305, so at turn 12+3=15, -83+36*3=-83+108=25, span [25,60], not 0.\n\nAt turn 14, ΔT=2, -83+72= -11, -48+72=24, span [-11,24], which includes 0? -11 to 24, yes, 0 is in between.\n\nBut this is for freeway 1,2, or 3, but we are not on those rows, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4,5,6: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nτ=-71, h=-48, span [-71,-48] at t=12.\n\nSpeed 24, at ΔT, [-71+24ΔT, -48+24ΔT]\n\nSet to 0: -71+24ΔT=0, ΔT=71/24≈2.958, at turn 15, -71+24*3=-71+72=1, span [1,24], not 0.\n\nAt turn 14, ΔT=2, -71+48= -23, -48+48=0, span [-23,0], which includes 0.\n\nBut again, on row 4,5, or 6, not where we are.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for our path, only row 7 and 8 matter, and at the times, safe.\n\nSo actions should be: at turn 12: U, turn 13: U.\n\nBut the player is at (0,7) initially, and we move to (0,8) at turn 13, then to (0,9) at turn 14.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut is there a need to specify more? H=2.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, here t1=12, H=2, so turns 12 and 13.\n\nAfter action at 13, position at 14 is 9.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car (24,13,right,4), at t=12 [13,24], which includes 13 to 24, and 0 not in, but at t=13 [17,28], fine.\n\nBut all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving up immediately causes issue, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that when you move to a new row, you are not on it until next turn, which we accounted for.\n\nSo I think H=2 is achievable.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,7), and cars on y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut at turn 12, on y=7, safe.\n\nIf I go U to y=8 at turn 13, on y=8 at turn 13, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9.\n\nPerhaps I could go to another row, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=6, then I have to come back, H larger.\n\nSo H=2 is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be boxed.\n\nBut the turn numbers are absolute, t1=12.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for t_1=12.\n\nPerhaps write as:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 13 on row 8, is there really no car?\n\nFreeway 8 has the same cars: at turn 13, spans as calculated.\n\nPerhaps I should write the spans explicitly.\n\nFor freeway 8 at turn 13 (T=13, ΔT=1):\n\nCar1: τ=-27, h=-16, s=4, direction right, so span [ -27 +4(1), -16 +4(1) ] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in.\n\nCar2: τ=49, h=60? The car is (60,49,right,4), head 60, tail 49, so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [49,60] at t1, at T=13, [49+4, 60+4]=[53,64]\n\n0 not in.\n\nCar3: (24,13,right,4), head 24, tail 13, span [13,24] at t1, at T=13, [13+4,24+4]=[17,28]\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for row 7 at turn 12: all spans away from 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2 with actions U at turn 12 and U at turn 13.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position at Turn 12**: The player is on row \\(y = 7\\).\n  - Cars on freeway 7 at turn 12:\n    - Car 1: Span \\([-27, -16]\\), 0 not in span.\n    - Car 2: Span \\([49, 60]\\), 0 not in span.\n    - Car 3: Span \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - No collision at turn 12.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 13 and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nNote: The player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and the horizontal movement is fixed at x=0. The player is on a freeway only when its y-coordinate is between 1 and 8 (inclusive). At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y) with y in {1,...,8}, then we must avoid the cars on that freeway. Specifically, if the car spans (which are moving) cover the x=0 point at turn T, then a collision occurs.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from one row to another, note that at the moment of the turn (at turn T), the player is still on the starting row. So when we move at turn T from y_T to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, then at turn T the player is on row y_T and at turn T+1 on row y_{T+1}. Therefore, at turn T we check row y_T, and at turn T+1 we check row y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are at turn 13 at (0,8). We need to get to (0,9). Since we are at y=8, and we want to go to y=9, we can do that by moving up (U) one time. However, we must check that during the entire journey we do not collide with cars. But note that we start at y=8 at turn 13. Then we will move to y=9 at turn 14. So we only have to check:\n\n- At turn 13: we are at y=8 -> we must check freeway 8 at turn 13 for collision.\n- At turn 14: we are at y=9 -> no freeway at y=9, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, the only potential collision is at turn 13 on freeway 8.\n\nBut note: we are already at freeway 8 at turn 13. So we must check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 13.\n\nGiven the car state for freeway 8:\nThree cars: \n1. (-12, -23, right, 4)\n2. (-48, -59, right, 4)\n3. (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nWait, note the representation: \nFor a right-moving car, the span at time t is given as [tail, head]? Actually, the problem states:\n- For a right-moving car: at time t1, the span is [τ, h] and then at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 8, the first car is given as (-12, -23, right, 4). This must be (head, tail, direction, speed) as per the column header? Actually, the header says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nSo for the first car: h = -12, τ = -23, d = right, s=4.\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the head is the front? Then the car extends from τ (tail) to h (head). However, note that the problem states for right-moving: [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, and then it moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both.\n\nBut in this representation, the car is at time t1: from τ to h. Since it's right-moving, and if h > τ, then the car is moving to the right. However, in this car: h=-12, τ=-23 -> which means the head is at -12 and the tail at -23. Since -12 > -23, so the car is indeed moving right.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at time t1=13, the car is from τ=-23 to h=-12.\n\nNow, we are at turn 13 (t1=13). We need to check if at turn 13, the x=0 is in the span of any car on freeway 8.\n\nSo for the first car: \n  span at time 13: [τ, h] = [-23, -12] -> does this include 0? No, because -23 <= x <= -12 and 0 is not in that interval.\n\nSecond car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n  head = -48, tail = -59 -> so the car is from -59 to -48? But wait: the problem says the representation is (head, tail) and then for right-moving, the span is [tail, head]. However, note that tail should be less than head for right-moving? Actually, the problem states: for right-moving, the car span at t1 is [τ, h] and then moves by adding. But if h is the head and τ the tail, then for a right-moving car we expect head > tail. However, in this car: head=-48, tail=-59 -> then head > tail? -48 > -59, so the car is from -59 to -48. Then at time 13: span = [-59, -48]. Does 0 fall in [-59,-48]? No.\n\nThird car: (28, 17, right, 4)\n  head=28, tail=17 -> but wait, 28>17, so the car is from 17 to 28? However, the representation says (head, tail) and then for right-moving: [τ, h] = [17,28]. But note: the problem says the car is given as (head, tail) and then we use the span as [tail, head] for right-moving? Actually, the problem states: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" and then for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So for this car: τ=17, h=28? But the table says (28, 17, ...) so head=28, tail=17. Then the span at t1=13 is [17,28]. Then 0 is not in [17,28].\n\nTherefore, at turn 13, none of the cars on freeway 8 cover x=0. So we are safe at turn 13.\n\nThen we can do:\nTurn 13: U -> then at turn 14, we are at y=9 -> goal reached.\n\nBut wait: what about the next turn? At turn 14, we are at y=9 and we don't have to check any freeway. So that's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H=1? Because we are at turn 13 and we do one action (at turn 13) and then at the next turn (turn 14) we are at the goal.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and we need H turns to reach at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we start at t1 and do H actions, and then at the end of these H actions (i.e., at turn t1+H) we have the new state. But note that the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then we have the position at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the update: after an action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\nSo we start at turn t1 = 13 at (0,8). Then we do an action at turn 13, and then at turn 14 we are at the next state.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nIf we do one action (H=1) then the actions are from t=0 to H-1=0, so only one action: at turn t1+0 = 13. Then at the next turn, which is turn 14 = t1+1, we are at y=9. But the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. Here, t1+H-1 = 13+1-1 = 13? That is the starting turn. But we start at y=8, not 9.\n\nAlternatively, if we do one action, then at turn 14 we are at y=9. But the turn index we are at after the action is turn 14. How do we express that in terms of H?\n\nLet me re-examine the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAfter the sequence, we are at turn t1+H (because we started at t1 and did H actions, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at turn t1+H). But the problem says we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That can't be because at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at the state after the action of turn t1+H-2? \n\nI think there might be a confusion in indexing.\n\nThe problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the update: after action a_t, we get the next state at turn t+1.\n\nSo:\n- At turn t1 (current turn): we are at (0, y_{t1}) and we choose action a_{t1}.\n- Then at turn t1+1: we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some future turn. The problem does not specify exactly which turn index we must be at, but we are to minimize the number of turns H, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nBut note: the condition is that at the turn when we are at (0,9), we must not be colliding. However, since y=9 has no cars, we are safe.\n\nNow, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H-1, the y-coordinate is 9.\n\nWe start at turn t1 = 13. We are at y=8 at turn 13.\n\nIf we take H=1 action: then we do one action at turn 13. Then at turn 14 (which is t1+1 = 14), we have y_{14} = y_{13} + Delta y_{13}. We want y_{t1+H-1} = y_{13+1-1}=y_{13}=9? But we are at y=8 at turn 13, so we cannot be at y=9 at turn 13. \n\nAlternatively, if we take H=2, then we do actions at turn 13 and turn 14. Then we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 13+2-1 = 14, we are at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2? But that would mean we do two actions to get to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut note: we can get to y=9 at turn 14 by doing one action at turn 13: U. Then at turn 14 we are at y=9. So we have achieved the goal at turn 14, but the problem requires that the turn index when we are at (0,9) is t1+H-1. So if we set H=2, then t1+H-1=13+2-1=14, which matches.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=2? But then we are forced to take two actions? However, we only need one action to get there. But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the minimal H such that we reach the goal at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWe can reach at turn 14 (which is t1+1) by taking one action. Then we have H such that t1+H-1 = 14 -> 13+H-1=14 -> H=2.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nTherefore, we have to take two actions? But we only need one to move up. What is the second action?\n\nWe can take the first action (at turn 13) as U, and then at turn 14 we are at 9. But we don't need to do anything at turn 14 because we are already at the goal. However, the sequence must have H=2 actions? Then we must specify an action for turn 14 as well.\n\nBut note: the problem says that we are to reach at turn t1+H-1=14. So after the two actions, we are at turn 15? But we are required to be at 9 at turn 14.\n\nAlternatively, the indexing might be that the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after having taken the first H-1 actions? \n\nLet me clarify with a small example.\n\nSuppose we start at turn t1 at position (0, y0). We take an action at turn t1: a_{t1}. Then we are at turn t1+1 at position (0, y1). Then we take an action at turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, then at turn t1+2 at position (0,y2).\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIf we set H=1: then we have no action? But then we are at turn t1 (13) at y=8, not 9.\n\nIf we set H=2: then we have one action? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: so for H=2, we have two actions? Actually, no: the index t runs from 0 to H-1, so there are H actions. But then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nSo if we take H=1: then we have one action at turn t1 (13). Then the next state is at turn 14. But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 = 13+1-1=13 to be (0,9). But at turn 13 we are at (0,8). So that doesn't work.\n\nIf we take H=2: then we have two actions: at turn 13 and turn 14. Then the state after the first action (at turn 13) is at turn 14. But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 = 13+2-1=14 to be (0,9). So that works: at turn 14 we are at (0,9). But note that we also have an action at turn 14. However, we are at y=9 at turn 14, and then we take an action at turn 14. But we are at y=9, and if we take any action (U, D, S), we remain at y=9? Because y must be in [0,9]: \n- If we go up: y=10 -> but then we clamp? The problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at y=9 and we do U, then we stay at 9? Similarly, D: 9-1=8? But we don't want that.\n\nSo we must be cautious: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and then we are done. But the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). We don't require to stay there? However, we must avoid collision at every turn until we are at the goal? Actually, we only care about the journey until we reach (0,9). But note that we must avoid collision at every turn we are on the freeways.\n\nBut at turn 14, we are at y=9, which is safe. Then at turn 14 we take an action? But the action at turn 14 is part of the sequence. However, after that action, we are at turn 15. But we don't care about what happens after we have reached the goal? Actually, the problem says \"to reach (0,9)\" meaning we only require that at some turn (which is turn 14) we are at (0,9). Then we can stop. But the sequence is fixed to H actions.\n\nHowever, note that we are required to output a sequence of H actions. So for H=2, we must output two actions.\n\nBut we can do: \nTurn 13: U -> then at turn 14 we are at 9.\nTurn 14: S (or U or D, but if we do U we go to 10 which is clamped to 9, so same as S) -> so we can do S.\n\nBut then we have taken two actions and we are at turn 15 at y=9? But the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1=14. However, at turn 14 we are at (0,9) and then we take the action at turn 14 to go to turn 15. But at turn 14, we are at (0,9) and that satisfies the condition? The condition is that we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1=14. So that happens at turn 14. The action at turn 14 then happens after we have already reached the goal. So that is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to do nothing at turn 14? But we have to output two actions.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n- H=2\n- Action at turn 13: U\n- Action at turn 14: S (or U or D, but S is safe and doesn't move)\n\nBut we must check that during the entire journey (turns 13 and 14) we avoid collisions.\n\nAt turn 13: we are at y=8 -> check freeway 8 at turn 13: as we saw, no car covers 0 -> safe.\nAt turn 14: we are at y=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut note: when we are at turn 13, we are at y=8. Then we take action U. Then at turn 14, we are at y=9. Then we take action S at turn 14: that moves us to ... but we are already at y=9, so we stay at y=9.\n\nIs there a possibility to do it in H=1? We saw that H=1 would require that at turn 13 we are at (0,9), but we start at (0,8) at turn 13. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2.\n\nBut wait: what if we do H=1? Then we require being at (0,9) at turn 13, which we are not. So H must be at least 2.\n\nBut note: we start at (0,8) at turn 13. We can only move at turn 13 to y=9 at turn 14. So we must have the state at turn 14 as (0,9). Therefore, the minimal H such that t1+H-1=14 is H=2.\n\nSo the answer is:\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut let's double-check the car movements? The problem says that we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on the freeway. We are on freeway 8 at turn 13. We checked the cars at turn 13 and they don't cover 0. But what about the next turn? Actually, we are not on freeway 8 at turn 14 because we moved to 9. So we don't care about the cars on freeway 8 at turn 14? Only at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are only on freeway 8 at turn 13. We don't go through any other freeway? We start at y=8 and move to y=9. So we are only at y=8 at turn 13 and then at y=9 at turn 14. So no other freeway is visited.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is two actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=2. So we output two actions.\n\nHowever, note that the goal is reached at turn 14, which is after the first action. The second action is just a formality. But we must do two actions? Or can we do only one action and have H=1? But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1=13 we are at 9, which we are not.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get to 9 at turn 13? Only if we start at 9, but we don't.\n\nSo we must do two actions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the minimal H such that after H actions we are at the goal at turn t1+H-1. So we are forced to use H=2.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut let me check the other freeways? We didn't check the freeways 1 to 7 because we are never on them. We are at y=8 at turn 13 and then at y=9 at turn 14. So we skip freeways 1-7.\n\nBut what if we had to go through them? We don't.\n\nBut note: the player starts at y=8 and goes to y=9. So no.\n\nTherefore, this should be the solution.\n\nBut wait: the car state for freeway 8 has three cars. We checked at turn 13. But what if the cars move and at turn 13 they are at a position that doesn't cover 0, but we need to check if the representation is correct?\n\nThe representation: for the third car: (28,17,right,4). But wait: head=28, tail=17? Then the span is [17,28]. But the direction is right, and they are moving at speed 4. So at turn 13, they are at [17,28]. Then at turn 14, they will be at [17+4, 28+4] = [21,32]. So still not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, the other cars: \nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,4) -> at turn 13: [-23,-12]. Then at turn 14: [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8] -> still not 0.\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,4) -> at turn 13: [-59,-48]; turn 14: [-55,-44] -> not 0.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the solution is two actions: U at turn 13 and S at turn 14.\n\nBut note: we could also do U at turn 13 and then U at turn 14? But at turn 14 we are at y=9, and if we do U, then we try to go to 10, which is clamped to 9. So we stay at 9. Similarly, D would go to 8. We don't want to leave 9. So S is safe.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require us to stay at 9, only to reach it at turn 14. However, we must avoid collision at turn 14: if we do D at turn 14, then at turn 14 we are at y=9 (safe) and then we move to y=8 at turn 15. But at turn 15 we would be at freeway 8 again? And we have to check freeway 8 at turn 15? But the problem only requires to reach (0,9) at turn 14. So we don't care about turn 15? Actually, we do care about avoiding collisions at every turn we are at? Because the problem says \"avoiding collisions\" throughout the journey. The journey includes every turn until we have taken the last action? \n\nBut note: we are required to output a sequence of H actions, and we must avoid collisions during the entire sequence of actions? \n\nSpecifically, we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? Because at each turn t in [t1, t1+H-1] we are at a state and then we take an action. Then at the next turn we move.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and then we choose a_t. Then we update to y_{t+1}. But we must avoid collision at every turn t (for the state we are in at the beginning of the turn?).\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). We must check that if y_T is between 1 and 8, then the cars on freeway y_T at turn T do not cover 0.\n\nIn our plan:\n- Turn 13: y_13=8 -> check freeway 8 at turn 13 -> safe.\n- Turn 14: y_14=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\nSo even if we do D at turn 14, at turn 14 we are at y=9 (safe). The collision check for the action at turn 14 is only at the state at the beginning of turn 14, which is (0,9). Then we do D, and then at turn 15 we would be at y=8. But we don't care about turn 15? Actually, we do, because the sequence of actions is for turns 13 and 14 (H=2). So we are required to avoid collision at every turn from 13 to 14? But turn 15 is beyond the last turn in the sequence? The problem does not say we have to avoid collisions after we have reached the goal? It says \"to reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut note: we reach (0,9) at turn 14. Then we take an action at turn 14. That action will lead us to turn 15. But we are not required to be safe at turn 15? The problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars ...\". It doesn't specify until when. But the journey is to reach (0,9). So once we are at (0,9) at turn 14, we have reached. The subsequent action might move us away, but we are still required to avoid collisions at every turn we are in? Because the problem says \"avoiding collisions\" without time bound.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, we should choose an action at turn 14 that doesn't cause a collision at turn 14 (which is already safe because y=9) and we don't care about turn 15? But the problem requires avoiding collisions for the entire sequence of actions. The sequence of actions is two actions: at turn 13 and 14. The state after the second action is at turn 15. We must avoid collision at turn 15? \n\nThe problem does not explicitly say, but it says \"to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions\". This implies that we must avoid collisions throughout the entire path until we reach (0,9). Since we reach (0,9) at turn 14, we don't need to avoid collisions beyond that? Actually, at turn 14 we are at (0,9) and we have reached. The action at turn 14 is taken after we have reached. So we don't care about what happens after? \n\nBut the collision condition is checked at every turn T for which we are in the grid. So if we do an action at turn 14 that moves us to y=8 at turn 15, then at turn 15 we are at freeway 8 and we must check for collision. And if there is a collision at turn 15, that would be a problem? But we have already reached the goal at turn 14. So we don't care about the state after the goal? \n\nThe problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". It doesn't say we have to stay there. So we only care about the journey until we first reach (0,9). In this case, we first reach (0,9) at turn 14. Then the action at turn 14 is taken, but that might move us away. However, we have already reached. \n\nBut to be safe, we can choose an action that doesn't cause a collision at turn 15? However, we are not required to avoid collisions after the goal? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nLooking at the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\". And we are required to avoid collisions. So we must avoid collisions at every turn we are in, regardless of whether we have reached the goal? \n\nTherefore, to be safe, we should choose an action at turn 14 that doesn't cause a collision at turn 15. \n\nBut note: at turn 14 we are at (0,9). Then we take an action a_{14}. Then we move to y_{15}. If we take S, then we stay at 9 -> then at turn 15 we are at (0,9) -> no collision. If we take U, we are clamped to 9 -> same. If we take D, then we go to 8. Then at turn 15 we are at (0,8) -> freeway 8. Then we must check freeway 8 at turn 15 for collision.\n\nSo let's check freeway 8 at turn 15.\n\nThe cars on freeway 8 at turn 15: remember we start from turn 13 (t1=13) and then at turn 15, the time difference is 15-13=2.\n\nFor each car on freeway 8 (same as before? the car state doesn't change? but they move):\n\nCar1: (-12,-23,right,4) -> at turn 13: tail=-23, head=-12. Then at turn 15: tail = -23 + 4*(15-13) = -23+8 = -15, head=-12+8=-4. So span [-15,-4] -> does 0 fall in [-15,-4]? Yes, because -15<=0<=-4? But 0 is greater than -4? No, 0 is not <= -4. So 0 is not in [-15,-4]? Actually, -15 <= x <= -4 -> so x must be between -15 and -4 inclusive. 0 is not in that interval.\n\nCar2: (-48,-59,right,4) -> at turn 13: tail=-59, head=-48. At turn 15: tail=-59+8=-51, head=-48+8=-40. So [-51,-40] -> 0 not in.\n\nCar3: (28,17,right,4) -> at turn 13: tail=17, head=28. At turn 15: tail=17+8=25, head=28+8=36. [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo even if we do D at turn 14, then at turn 15 we are at freeway 8 and it is safe. So we could do D? But why would we? We can do S and remain at 9.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require us to remain at 9. So we can do any action. However, to minimize risk, we can do S.\n\nBut since we are outputting the sequence, we can choose S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n\nor\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: D\n}\n\nBut D would move us to 8 at turn 15, which is safe as we checked. But we don't need to do that. S is simpler.\n\nBut the problem doesn't prefer one action over another as long as we avoid collision and reach at turn 14.\n\nSo we can choose any. Let's choose S for simplicity.\n\nBut note: if we do D at turn 14, then we are at 8 at turn 15. But we have already taken two actions and we have reached the goal at turn 14. So that's acceptable. But the problem does not require that we stay at 9. So it's acceptable.\n\nBut to be clean, we can do S.\n\nTherefore, I will output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we are to output actions for turns starting at t1. So the first action is at turn 13, then turn 14.\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut what if we do nothing? Then we stay at 8 at turn 13 and then at turn 14 we are still at 8. Then we are not at 9. So we must move.\n\nWe must do at least one U to get to 9.\n\nBut we can do:\n\nTurn 13: S -> then at turn 14 we are at 8. Then we do U at turn 14 -> then at turn 15 we are at 9. Then we would have reached at turn 15. Then H would be 3? because we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=13+H-1=15 -> so H=3. But that is not minimal.\n\nTherefore, minimal is H=2.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me check if there is any other constraint? For instance, the player cannot move from 8 to 9 if there is a car at freeway 8 at turn 13? But we checked: there isn't.\n\nTherefore, we are confident.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn 13. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. \n\nAt turn 13, the player is on freeway 8. The cars on freeway 8 at turn 13 are:\n- Car 1: head = -12, tail = -23, direction = right, speed = 4. Span = [-23, -12]. 0 is not in [-23, -12].\n- Car 2: head = -48, tail = -59, direction = right, speed = 4. Span = [-59, -48]. 0 is not in [-59, -48].\n- Car 3: head = 28, tail = 17, direction = right, speed = 4. Span = [17, 28]. 0 is not in [17, 28].\n\nSince no car spans x = 0 at turn 13, the player can safely take action U (up) to move from y = 8 to y = 9 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, the player is at y = 9, which has no freeway and thus no collision risk. The goal (0, 9) is reached at turn 14, which corresponds to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13 + H - 1\\). Setting this equal to 14 gives \\(H = 2\\). Therefore, two actions are required: one to reach y = 9 and one additional action to satisfy the sequence length \\(H = 2\\). The second action can be S (stay), as the player is already at y = 9 and no further movement is needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 13: U (move up to y = 9 at turn 14).\n- At turn 14: S (remain at y = 9).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal at turn 14 with no collisions and minimal \\(H = 2\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: S\n}",
