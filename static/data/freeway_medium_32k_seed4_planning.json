        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells me if it's left-moving or right-moving. From the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases, tail decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so head increases, tail increases.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T. Importantly, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe player position is updated at the end of the action, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T is the position.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAnd when I take an action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, so during turn T, I'm on y_T.\n\nIf I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I won't be considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so for collision at turn T, I only care about cars on y_T.\n\nSimilarly, if I'm moving to y_{T+1}, I don't check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T; I only check when I'm actually on that freeway.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t_1=0, and I need to find actions for turns t=0 to t=H-1, so that after H turns, I'm at (0,9). Since actions start at t=0, and after H actions, at turn H, I should be at y_H =9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe position at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nI start at turn 0, y_0 =0.\n\nI take actions a_0, a_1, ..., a_{H-1}, so after H actions, at turn H, y_H should be 9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to t=H-1, so H actions, to reach turn H with y_H=9.\n\nNow, for each turn t, I need to avoid collision: at turn t, for the freeway y_t, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nThe cars are updated based on the time from t_1=0.\n\nSo for any turn T, the car spans are computed from their state at t_1.\n\nGiven car at t_1: for freeway k, cars with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T, span is:\n\nIf left-moving (d=left? but in the table, direction is given as right or left? In the car state, it says \"direction d\", but in the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48,-59,right,3), so d is right or left.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nLeft-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\nRight-moving: span moves right, head increases.\n\nIn the example, freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59, direction right, speed=3.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see.\n\nIn the span definition:\n\nFor left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the left end? I think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ], so h is the head, τ is the tail, and since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think, and both increase.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But it says (head h, tail τ), but for right-moving, the head is the front, which is the right end.\n\nI think \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined relative to direction.\n\nIn the description, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the update, for left-moving, it uses [h, τ], and for right-moving, it uses [τ, h].\n\nLet's parse.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] meaning h is the position at one end, τ at the other, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, and both increase.\n\nIn the car state, it lists (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor a given direction, head and tail are defined.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59, direction = right.\n\nSince direction is right, for right-moving, the span should be from tail to head, with tail < head, because moving right, tail is left, head is right.\n\nHere tail = -59, head = -48, so tail < head, span from -59 to -48.\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 3T, -48 + 3T] since t_1=0, T is turn number.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if there was one, it would be [h - sT, τ - sT] with h and τ such that h > τ for moving left? In left-moving, if moving left, head is left, tail is right, I think.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly others, but let's list all cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars at t_1=0.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (-48, -59, right, 3)  → one car, span at T: [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\nFreeway k=2: (48, 37, right, 12) → head=48, tail=37, direction=right, so span at t_1: [37,48] since right-moving, [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt turn T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) → same car? But it's a different freeway, so separate.\n\nFreeway 3: (48,37,right,12) → [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nFreeway 4: (48,37,right,12) → same\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,12) → same\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 12T, 0 + 12T] = [-11 + 12T, 12T]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, span at t_1: [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, span at t_1: [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 6T, 6T]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo for each freeway, the cars:\n\nk=1: one car with speed 3, span [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\nk=2: one car with speed 12, span [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nk=3: same as k=2\n\nk=4: same\n\nk=5: same\n\nk=6: two cars: car1: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T], car2: [-11 + 12T, 12T]\n\nk=7: two cars: car1: [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T], car2: [-11 + 6T, 6T]\n\nk=8: same as k=7\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn 0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway with cars, I think. The freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the target, no cars.\n\nSo at y=0, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal number of turns H, so I need to move up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nEach move U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to be at y=9, the minimal H would be 9 if I could go straight up with no issues, but I have to go through y=1 to 8, and at each, I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, from turn 0 to turn H.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn 1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nI need y_H =9 after H actions.\n\nSo to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so H=9 if all U.\n\nBut with collisions, it might take more if I have to stay or move down.\n\nI need to find a sequence where for each turn t, when I am on y_t, the freeway y_t has no car with 0 in span at time t.\n\nSince y_t is the freeway I'm on at turn t.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I need to know when 0 is in the span of cars on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for each k, at what times T is there a car on k such that 0 ∈ span.\n\nThen for the player, when on freeway k at turn t, it must be that at that t, no car on k has 0 in span.\n\nSo let's find for each k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nStart with freeway k=1: one car, span [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nSo -59 + 3T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3T ≤ 0 ⇒ 3T ≤ 59 ⇒ T ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so T ≤ 19 since T integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 3T ⇒ 48 ≤ 3T ⇒ T ≥ 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nT=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, since the car is on freeway 1, this is for y=1.\n\nFreeway k=2: one car, span [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12T ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12T\n\nBut 37 + 12T ≥ 37 >0 for T≥0, so left end >0, so 0 cannot be ≤ left end since left end positive, so 0 not in [37+12T,48+12T] for any T, since the interval is to the right of 37.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3,4,5, same thing, span [37+12T,48+12T] all positive for T≥0, so 0 never in span. So freeways 2,3,4,5 are always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nT=0, [37,48], 37>0, so 0 not in.\n\nT=1, [49,60], etc., always min >0, so yes, no car covers 0 at any time for k=2,3,4,5.\n\nNow freeway k=6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T], as above, always positive, so 0 not in this span.\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 12T, 12T]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12T ≤ 0 ≤ 12T\n\nFirst: -11 + 12T ≤ 0 ⇒ 12T ≤ 11 ⇒ T ≤ 11/12 <1, so T=0? T integer, T≥0.\n\nT=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0 ≤0? 0≤0 true, but -11≤0 true, and 0≤12*0=0 true, so at T=0, 0 is in [-11,0], yes.\n\nT=1: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 1>0, so 0 not ≤1? 0 ≤1 is true, but 0 ≤ left end? Left end is 1, 0 <1, so 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, T=0: [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included.\n\nT=0: -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes.\n\nT=1: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT negative? T≥0, so only at T=0, for this car.\n\nBut freeway k=6 at T=0, if player is on y=6 at turn 0, but player starts at y=0 at turn 0, not on freeway yet.\n\nFor the player, at turn t, if on y=6, need to check at that t.\n\nNow, for second car: 0 in span only at T=0.\n\nFirst car never, so for k=6, unsafe only at T=0.\n\nBut at T=0, if on y=6, but player not on y=6 at t=0.\n\nNow freeway k=7: two cars.\n\nCar1: [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nFirst: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ⇒ 6T ≤ 59 ⇒ T ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833, T ≤ 9\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 6T ⇒ 48 ≤ 6T ⇒ T ≥ 8\n\nSo T from 8 to 9 inclusive? T=8,9.\n\nCheck:\n\nT=8: -59 + 48 = -11? -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\n-48 + 48 = 0, so [ -11, 0 ], so 0 in span.\n\nT=9: -59 + 54 = -5, -48 + 54 = 6, so [ -5, 6 ], 0 in span.\n\nT=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for car1, 0 in span at T=8,9.\n\nCar2: [-11 + 6T, 6T]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ 6T\n\nFirst: -11 + 6T ≤ 0 ⇒ 6T ≤ 11 ⇒ T ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, T≤1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 6T, true for T≥0\n\nSo for T=0: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=1: [-11+6,6] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=2: [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo car2: 0 in span at T=0 and T=1.\n\nNow for freeway k=7, unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nSo at T=0: car2 has it, so unsafe.\n\nT=1: car2 has it.\n\nT=2: no car has it? car1 at T=2: [-59+12, -48+12]= [-47,-36], negative, 0 not in; car2 [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=3 to T=7: car1 span like [-59+18,-48+18]=[-41,-30] all negative; car2 at T=3: [7,18] etc, all positive, so 0 not in.\n\nT=8: car1 has [ -11,0], 0 in; car2 at T=8: [-11+48,48]= [37,48], positive, so car1 has 0.\n\nT=9: car1 [-5,6], 0 in; car2 [43,54] etc.\n\nT=10: car1 [1,12], 0 not; car2 [49,60], no.\n\nSo for k=7, unsafe at T=0,1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=8 same as k=7, so unsafe at T=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway k=1: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nk=2,3,4,5: always safe, as established.\n\nk=6: unsafe only at T=0 (from car2)\n\nk=7 and 8: unsafe at T=0,1,8,9.\n\nk=1: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 0, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nBut I must avoid being on an unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway, when I am on it at turn t, it must be safe at that t.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0, and need to be at y=9.\n\nThe direct way: go up to y=1 at turn 1, then to y=2 at turn 2, ..., to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nBut let's see the safety at each y and t.\n\nAt turn t, if I am on y=k, it must be safe.\n\nNow, for k=1, unsafe only at t=16-19, which are late, so for early turns, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, k=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\nk=6 unsafe only at t=0, but t=0 is now, player not on k=6.\n\nk=7 and 8 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn H.\n\nSince I can move multiple steps per freeway, but to minimize turns, probably go up as fast as possible, except when need to avoid.\n\nFirst, from y=0 to y=1: at turn 0, y=0, safe.\n\nI take action a_0. If I go up, a_0=U, then y_1 =1 at turn 1.\n\nAt turn 1, I am on y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway k=1.\n\nk=1 is safe except at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt t=1, which is early, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=2 at turn 2, and so on.\n\nBut let's see when I reach each y.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0, safe.\n\na_0=U, then t=1, y=1.\n\nAt t=1, on y=1, which is safe since t=1 not in 16-19.\n\nThen a_1=U, t=2, y=2.\n\ny=2, k=2, always safe.\n\na_2=U, t=3, y=3, k=3, safe.\n\na_3=U, t=4, y=4, k=4, safe.\n\na_4=U, t=5, y=5, k=5, safe.\n\na_5=U, t=6, y=6, k=6.\n\nNow at t=6, on y=6.\n\nk=6 unsafe only at t=0, but t=6, so should be safe?\n\nk=6: only unsafe at t=0.\n\nAt t=6, cars: first car [37+12*6,48+12*6]=[37+72,48+72]=[109,120], not near 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12*6, 12*6] = [-11+72,72] = [61,72], not near 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a_5=U? After a_5=U at t=5, y=5, then to y=6 at t=6.\n\nThen a_6=U, t=7, y=7, k=7.\n\nNow k=7 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nAt t=7, is it safe? t=7 not in {0,1,8,9}, so should be safe.\n\nCheck: k=7 at t=7.\n\nCar1: [-59 +6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-11+6*7, 6*7] = [-11+42,42] = [31,42], positive, 0 not in. So safe.\n\nThen a_7=U, t=8, y=8, k=8.\n\nk=8 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nAt t=8, unsafe! Because t=8 is unsafe for k=7 and k=8.\n\nk=8 at t=8: unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=8 at t=8, collision.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=8, y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nThen I need to avoid being on y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=8 or t=9 also unsafe? y=7 and y=8 both have cars and unsafe at same times.\n\nk=7 and k=8 both unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow at t=7, if I go to y=7, it was safe, but then from y=7, I need to go to y=8.\n\nBut at t=8, if I go to y=8, unsafe.\n\nI could stay on y=7 or go down, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince t=8 and t=9 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8, I need to be not on these freeways at those times.\n\nI could be on y=6 or y=9 or something.\n\ny=9 has no cars, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSo perhaps at t=7, I am on y=7, which is safe at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I can choose action: if I go up to y=8, then at t=8, y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=8? No, at t=7, I take action a_7.\n\nAfter a_7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nAt t=7, I am on y=7.\n\nI take a_7:\n\n- If a_7 = U, then y_8 = 8, and at turn t=8, I am on y=8, which is unsafe at t=8.\n\n- If a_7 = S, then y_8 =7, so at t=8, I am on y=7, which is unsafe at t=8.\n\n- If a_7 = D, then y_8 =6, so at t=8, I am on y=6.\n\ny=6 is k=6, which is safe at all t except t=0, so at t=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on y=6.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, if on y=6, I can go up to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7 is unsafe? k=7 unsafe at t=9.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nI could go directly to y=8 or something.\n\nLet's think.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo for t=8 and t=9, I should not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nI could be on y=6, y=9, or lower.\n\ny=9 is safe, but I might not be there yet.\n\nSimilarly, y=5, etc.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=6, I was on y=6.\n\nt=6: y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_6=U, to y=7 at t=7, safe as we saw.\n\nNow at t=7, on y=7.\n\nInstead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nIf I go down, to y=6 at t=8.\n\na_7 = D, then y_8 =7 -1 =6.\n\nSo at t=8, on y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, on y=6, I can take action.\n\nIf I go up, a_8=U, then y_9=7, at turn t=9, on y=7.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y_9=6, still on y=6.\n\nOr go down to y=5.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nt=9 is unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=5, etc.\n\nBut I need to cross y=7 and y=8 later.\n\nThe unsafe times are only t=8 and t=9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nAfter t=9, they are safe again.\n\nFor example, at t=10, k=7: car1 [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in; car2 [ -11+60, 60] = [49,60], no, so safe.\n\nSimilarly k=8 same.\n\nAnd for earlier times, before t=8, they might be safe, like t=7 we saw safe.\n\nSo I can cross y=7 and y=8 before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nIn the direct path, I reach y=7 at t=7, which is safe, but then I need to go to y=8 at t=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I should not go to y=8 at t=8.\n\nI could stay on y=7 at t=8, but that is also unsafe.\n\nSo at t=7, I should not stay or go up; I should go down to y=6.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I can stay on y=6 or go down further, but that might delay.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at t=8 and t=9, I can wait on y=6 until t=10 or something.\n\nBut at t=8, on y=6, I can go up at t=9 to y=7? But at t=9, if I go to y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nAction at t=8: if a_8=U, then y_9 = y_8 +1, since on y=6, y_9=7, at turn t=9, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf a_8=S, y_9=6, on y=6 at t=9.\n\nIf a_8=D, y_9=5, on y=5 at t=9.\n\ny=5 is safe, but I need to go up later.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=6 or y=5.\n\nt=9 is unsafe for y=7 and y=8, but I'm not on them.\n\nAfter t=9, I can go up.\n\nFor example, at t=9, if on y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=7 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=11, etc.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nFirst, let's list the turns and possible actions.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0, safe.\n\na_0: I must go up, since I need to increase y. If I stay or down, I stay at y=0, waste time.\n\nSo a_0=U, then t=1, y=1, safe (since t=1 not 16-19).\n\nt=1, y=1, safe.\n\na_1=U, t=2, y=2, safe.\n\na_2=U, t=3, y=3, safe.\n\na_3=U, t=4, y=4, safe.\n\na_4=U, t=5, y=5, safe.\n\na_5=U, t=6, y=6, safe.\n\nNow t=6, y=6, safe.\n\na_6: if U, to y=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7, y=7, safe (t=7 not unsafe time).\n\nNow at t=7, y=7.\n\na_7: if U, to y=8 at t=8, but t=8 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf S, y=8? a_7=S, then y_8 = y_7 +0 =7, so at t=8, on y=7, which is unsafe at t=8.\n\nIf D, y_8=6, at t=8, on y=6, safe.\n\nSo only safe choice is a_7=D, to y=6 at t=8.\n\nThus a_7=D.\n\nNow t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nNow at t=8, on y=6.\n\na_8: I can go U, S, or D.\n\nIf U, a_8=U, then y_9=7 at turn t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7 is unsafe (since k=7 unsafe at t=9).\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf S, a_8=S, y_9=6, at t=9, on y=6, safe.\n\nIf D, y_9=5, on y=5 at t=9, safe but lower.\n\nNow, to avoid being on y=7 at t=9, I should not go to y=7 at t=9.\n\nSo at t=8, I should not go up; I should stay or go down.\n\nIf I stay, at t=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I can go to y=7 at t=10.\n\nt=10, y=7 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nAt t=8, a_8=S, then y_9=6, at t=9, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, a_9=U, to y=7 at t=10.\n\nt=10, y=7, now check safety: k=7 at t=10.\n\nAs before, car1: [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\ncar2: [-11+60,60]=[49,60], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen a_10=U, to y=8 at t=11.\n\nt=11, y=8, k=8 at t=11.\n\ncar1: [-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18], positive.\n\ncar2: [-11+66,66]=[55,66], positive. Safe.\n\nThen a_11=U, to y=9 at t=12.\n\nt=12, y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nAnd I am at (0,9).\n\nNow, how many turns? From t=0 to t=12, I have actions from a_0 to a_11, so 12 actions, H=12, y_12=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI could have reached earlier.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at t=8, I could go down and up, but that might take more time.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, instead of going down, I could go up earlier or later.\n\nBut in this case, I reached y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut minimal possible is 9, but with delays.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by slowing down earlier.\n\nFor example, at some point before, I can wait so that I cross y=7 and y=8 before t=8.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are safe before t=8, except t=0,1 but I not there.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nBut to go to y=8, the next turn t=8 is unsafe.\n\nI cannot go to y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut if I could be at y=8 earlier, but I reached y=7 at t=7, which is the earliest possible since I started at y=0 t=0.\n\ny=0 to y=7 in 7 turns, t=7.\n\nThen to y=8 should be t=8, but unsafe.\n\nSo I must delay crossing y=8 until after t=9.\n\nThus, I need to spend at least two extra turns somewhere.\n\nIn my sequence, I spent two extra turns: at t=7 I went down to y=6 at t=8, and at t=8 I stayed, so from t=7 to t=9 I was on y=6 or moving, but y decreased and stayed.\n\nFrom t=6 y=6, to t=7 y=7 (after a_6=U), then a_7=D to y=6 at t=8, then a_8=S to y=6 at t=9, then a_9=U to y=7 at t=10.\n\nSo from t=8 to t=9, I was on y=6, not moving up.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12.\n\nI could at t=8 go down to y=5 and come back, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=8, on y=6, if a_8=D, to y=5 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U to y=6 at t=10, etc., but then I reach higher y later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo staying at y=6 during t=8 and t=9 is better.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=9 I am on y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut at t=9, I could go directly to y=7 if it were safe, but it's not.\n\nAnother thought: can I be on y=8 at t=7? No, because at t=6 I was on y=6, to y=7 at t=7, cannot jump.\n\nSo I think H=12 is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the delay.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower in the beginning to arrive later.\n\nFor example, if I start by staying at y=0 for a few turns, then go up.\n\nBut that might make me arrive later, and I might hit other unsafe times.\n\nFor example, k=1 has unsafe at t=16-19, which is late, so if I delay, I might hit that.\n\nIn this case, with no delay, I reach y=8 at t=8, but unsafe, so I delay after y=6.\n\nBut if I go slower earlier, say stay at y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe, but I need to move up.\n\nSuppose at t=0, I stay: a_0=S, then t=1, y=0, still safe, but no progress.\n\nThen a_1=U, t=2, y=1, etc., but I will reach y=6 later, say at t=7 or something.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: a_0=S, y_1=0 (since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\na_0=S, then y_1=0, at turn t=1, on y=0.\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=1, at t=2.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=2, t=3.\n\n...\nCompared to before, I started going up at t=0, reached y=6 at t=6.\n\nIf I stay at t=0, I reach y=6 at t=7: t=1 y=0, t=2 y=1, ..., t=7 y=6.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6.\n\nThen a_7=U to y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 is unsafe! k=7 unsafe at t=8.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nThen I need to avoid, similar issue.\n\nAnd I am later, so worse.\n\nIf I stay multiple times, even worse.\n\nSo better to go up fast until y=6.\n\nThen at y=6, I need to handle the unsafe period for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at t=8 and t=9, I should not be on them at those times.\n\nI can be on y=6 during t=8 and t=9, then go up after.\n\nIn my sequence, I was on y=6 at t=8 and t=9? In my first sequence: at t=8, y=6 (after a_7=D from y=7), and at t=9, y=6 (after a_8=S).\n\nThen at t=10, y=7, etc.\n\nI could at t=8, from y=6, go down to y=5 at t=9, but then I have to come back, takes more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo H=12 seems reasonable.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: at t=6, I am on y=6.\n\nInstead of going up to y=7 at t=7, I could stay on y=6 for a turn.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=6, a_6=S, then y_7=6, at t=7, on y=6.\n\nThen at t=7, a_7=U, to y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nIf I stay longer, say at t=6, a_6=S, y_7=6, t=7.\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=6, t=8, on y=6 safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to go to y=7 after t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=8, on y=6, a_8=U, to y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo I must not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nTherefore, during t=8 and t=9, I should be on y≤6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nSo on y=6 or below.\n\nThen at t=10, I can go to y=7.\n\nIn terms of time, the earliest I can be at y=7 safely is t=10.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12.\n\nNow, I reached y=6 at t=6.\n\nFrom t=6 to t=10, I need to be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=6, I am at y=6.\n\nI can stay on y=6 for some turns, then go up.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at t=10, I need to take action at t=9 to go up from y=6 or something.\n\nLet's see the actions.\n\nAt t=6, y=6.\n\nI need y_{10} =7, for example.\n\ny_{10} = y_6 + sum of Δy from t=6 to t=9.\n\ny_{10} = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\ny_6 =6\n\nI want y_{10} =7, for instance.\n\nThen 7 = 6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nSo Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 =1\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSimilarly, during this, I need to be safe at each turn.\n\nNow, at t=7,8,9 I need to not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSince I am going from y=6 to possibly y=6 or less, and up to y=7 at t=10.\n\nFor example, I can stay on y=6 for t=7,8,9.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, a_6=S, then y_7=6, at t=7, on y=6 safe.\n\nThen a_7=S, y_8=6, at t=8, on y=6 safe.\n\nThen a_8=S, y_9=6, at t=9, on y=6 safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_{10}=7, at t=10, on y=7 safe.\n\nThen proceed: a_{10}=U, y_{11}=8, t=11, safe.\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=9, t=12.\n\nSame as before, H=12.\n\nIn my first sequence, I had a_6=U to y=7 at t=7, then a_7=D to y=6 at t=8, a_8=S to y=6 at t=9, then a_9=U to y=7 at t=10, etc., also reached y=9 at t=12.\n\nIn that case, I have an extra down and up, but same time.\n\nIn this sequence, I stayed on y=6 for three turns: t=7,8,9 with y=6.\n\nIn the first, I was at y=7 at t=7, then down to y=6 at t=8, same as y=6.\n\nBut in terms of actions, both have 12 actions to reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I go to y=7 at t=7, which is safe, but then I cannot go to y=8 immediately because t=8 unsafe.\n\nBut if at t=7 I go down to y=6, then at t=8 I am at y=6, and I can go up to y=7 at t=10? No.\n\nt=8 to t=10.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, if I go up to y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nSo I must wait until t=10 to be on y=7.\n\nThus, the critical point is that y=7 and y=8 are inaccessible during t=8 and t=9, so I must be below during those turns.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is t=12, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 before t=8.\n\nBut I reach y=6 at t=6, then to y=7 at t=7, y=8 at t=8, but t=8 unsafe.\n\nAnd I cannot reach y=8 earlier than t=8 from start.\n\ny=0 to y=8 in 8 turns, t=8, but unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 before t=8 or after t=9 without delay.\n\nHence, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, about k=1, unsafe at t=16-19, but since I reach y=9 at t=12, which is before 16, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn my first sequence:\n\nt=0: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nt=2: a_2=U, y_3=3\n\nt=3: a_3=U, y_4=4\n\nt=4: a_4=U, y_5=5\n\nt=5: a_5=U, y_6=6\n\nt=6: a_6=U, y_7=7\n\nt=7: a_7=D, y_8=6  // down to avoid\n\nt=8: a_8=S, y_9=6  // stay\n\nt=9: a_9=U, y_{10}=7\n\nt=10: a_{10}=U, y_{11}=8\n\nt=11: a_{11}=U, y_{12}=9\n\nAt t=12, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions: a_0 to a_11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} for t from 0 to 11.\n\nt_1=0.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=7 I went down, but is that necessary?\n\nI could have stayed on y=6 earlier.\n\nBut same H.\n\nNow, another thing: freeway k=6 has a car, but we saw it only unsafe at t=0, so no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=8 and t=9 I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, about the action at t=7: I have a_7=D, but going down might seem odd, but to avoid, it's fine.\n\nI could have not gone to y=7 at all until later.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=6, a_6=S, y_7=6, t=7 on y=6\n\na_7=S, y_8=6, t=8 on y=6\n\na_8=S, y_9=6, t=9 on y=6\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=7, t=10 on y=7\n\na_{10}=U, y_{11}=8, t=11 on y=8\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=9, t=12 on y=9\n\nSame.\n\nBut in this, I didn't go to y=7 early, so no down move.\n\nPerhaps this is simpler, only stay actions.\n\nIn the first sequence, I have a down move, but it doesn't hurt.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nI think the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on k=6.\n\nk=6 has two cars, but we saw only unsafe at t=0.\n\nIn the sequence, when on y=6 at t=6,7,8,9, all safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the target is (0,9), and y=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nIn the action sequence, I need to list from turn t_1=0.\n\nSo for H=12, actions a_0 to a_11.\n\nIn the second sequence: all up except stay at y=6 for three turns.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S  // stay at y=6\n\nTurn 7: S  // stay\n\nTurn 8: S  // stay\n\nTurn 9: U  // to y=7\n\nTurn 10: U // to y=8\n\nTurn 11: U // to y=9\n\nAt turn 11 action, y_{12}=9.\n\nIn terms of turn index: after a_{11}, y_{12}=9.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had a down at turn 7.\n\nBut both reach at same time.\n\nI think the stay sequence is fine.\n\nNow, in the stay sequence, at turn 6,7,8: all S, at y=6.\n\nBut at turn 6, I take a_6=S, so y_7=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the answer, I need to write the actions.\n\nBut in the problem, t_1=0, so turn t_1 is turn 0.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: a_0\nTurn 1: a_1\n...\n}\n\nWith actions.\n\nNow, for freeway k=1, unsafe at t=16-19, but I am done by t=12, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has (0,-11,right,12) at t=0, span [-11,0], which covers 0 at t=0, but since player not on it, fine.\n\nNow, I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut earlier I thought about going down, but with stay, it's cleaner.\n\nSo I'll go with the sequence with stay.\n\nActions:\n\na_0: U\n\na_1: U\n\na_2: U\n\na_3: U\n\na_4: U\n\na_5: U  // after this, at t=6, y=6\n\na_6: S  // stay at y=6 for turn t=7? Let's list y after action.\n\nAt t=0: y=0, take a_0=U, so y_1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, take a_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\nt=5: y=5, take a_5=U, y_6=6\n\nNow at t=6: y=6, take a_6=S, then y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, take a_7=S, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, take a_8=S, y_9=6\n\nt=9: y=6, take a_9=U, y_{10}=7\n\nt=10: y=7, take a_{10}=U, y_{11}=8\n\nt=11: y=8, take a_{11}=U, y_{12}=9\n\nNow at turn t=12, position (0,9), reached.\n\nActions from a_0 to a_{11}, 12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=9, I take a_9=U from y=6 to y=7 at t=10.\n\nt=10 on y=7, safe as before.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this sequence, I never went to y=7 before t=10, so no down move.\n\nBut in terms of time, same as before.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo make H smaller, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother point: at t=8, on y=6, I could go down to y=5 and up faster, but no, because to go up, I need to go through the freeways.\n\nFor example, if at t=8, y=6, I go down to y=5 at t=9, then at t=9 on y=5, then a_9=U to y=6 at t=10, then a_{10}=U to y=7 at t=11, etc., reach y=9 at t=13, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 1, but no issue.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 6: S, which is at t=6, action S.\n\nThen turn 7: S, t=7, action S.\n\nTurn 8: S, t=8, action S.\n\nTurn 9: U, t=9, action U.\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn t=9, I take action U, so y_{10}=7.\n\nAt turn t=10, I am on y=7, which is safe since t=10 not unsafe time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 has cars, but at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in the sequence, H=12.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=11.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nThat means after 11 actions, y_{11}=9.\n\nStarted at y=0, so need net +9 in 11 moves.\n\nEach move ±1 or 0, so possible if I have 9 up and 2 other moves, say down or stay.\n\nBut if I go down or stay, I need to compensate with more up, but since I have to be at y=9, the net must be +9.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D must be 9, and number of S can be anything, but total moves H.\n\ny_H - y_0 = sum Δy = number of U minus number of D, since S contributes 0.\n\ny_0=0, y_H=9, so U - D =9.\n\nAnd total actions H = U + D + S.\n\nSo U + D + S = H\n\nU - D =9\n\nThen 2U + S = H +9\n\nSince S >=0, H >=9.\n\nTo minimize H, minimize H, so S=0, then 2U = H+9, so H must be odd, etc.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nIn this case, with the unsafe times, it might not be possible with H=11.\n\nSuppose H=11, then U - D =9, U + D + S =11.\n\nThen 2U + S =20, so U=10, S=0, D=1; or U=9, S=2, D=0; etc.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 without collision.\n\nThe critical part is around y=7 and y=8 at t=8,9.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=9 at t=11.\n\nThen I need to be on y=8 at some point, but y=8 unsafe at t=8,9, so I must be on y=8 at t<8 or t>9.\n\nt=7 or t=10 or t=11.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nNow, at t=11, I am at y=9, so not on y=8.\n\nSo I must be on y=8 at t<=7 or t=10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=10, for example.\n\nThen from y=8 at t=10 to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, need to be on y=7 at some t.\n\nNow, earliest to reach y=7 is t=7, from y=0 in 7 moves.\n\nBut at t=7, y=7 safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nBe on y=7 at t=10? If I go to y=7 at t=10, then to y=8 at t=11, but at t=11, I need to be at y=9, so from y=7 to y=9 in one move? No, can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo impossible to skip.\n\nMust be on each y at some point.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=10, for example.\n\nThen I need to be at y=8 at turn t=10.\n\nThen y_{10}=8.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=8.\n\nNow, k=8 at t=10 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen a_{10}=U, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, to have y_{10}=8.\n\nStarted from y=0 at t=0.\n\nNeed to reach y=8 in 10 turns? y_{10}=8.\n\ny_{10} = y_0 + sum_{t=0 to 9} Δy_t = 0 + sum =8\n\nSo net +8 in 10 moves.\n\nU - D =8, U + D + S =10.\n\nThen 2U + S =18.\n\nPossible with U=9, S=0, D=1; or U=8, S=2, D=0; etc.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8 safe.\n\nBut when do I cross y=7?\n\nI need to be on y=7 at some turn before.\n\nSuppose I reach y=7 at t=9? But t=9 unsafe for y=7.\n\nNot possible.\n\nReach y=7 at t=10? But at t=10, I need to be on y=8 for y_{10}=8.\n\nContradiction.\n\ny_{10}=8, so at turn t=10, I am on y=8.\n\nTo be on y=7, it must be at some earlier turn, say t<10.\n\nIf at t=9, I am on y=7, but unsafe.\n\nIf at t=8, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=7, on y=7, safe, but then to go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nCannot directly.\n\nIf I am on y=7 at t=7, then at t=7, action: if I go down, to y=6 at t=8, etc., but then I might not reach y=8 by t=10.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=7, y=7, a_7=D, to y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, I need to get to y=8 at t=10.\n\nFrom t=8 y=6 to t=10 y=8.\n\nIn two moves, I can go up twice: a_8=U, y_9=7 at t=9, but at t=9, y=7 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\na_8=U, to y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nIf a_8=S, y_9=6, then a_9=U, y_{10}=7, but I need y_{10}=8, not 7.\n\ny_{10}=7, but I want y_{10}=8 for H=11.\n\nIf a_8=U, y_9=7 at t=9 unsafe, or if I could go directly, no.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 at t=9 safely.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=7 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nMust be on y=7 at t<=7 or t>=10.\n\nBut at t=10, if I am on y=7, then y_{10}=7, but I need y_{10}=8 for the plan, not consistent.\n\nIn this H=11 case, I want y_{10}=8.\n\nSo at t=10, on y=8.\n\nThen the last time I was on y=7 must be before, say at t=9 or earlier.\n\nIf at t=9, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=8, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=7, on y=7, safe, but then from there, to go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe, or if I stay, y_8=7, unsafe at t=8.\n\nNo way.\n\nIf I go to y=7 earlier, but I cannot reach before t=7.\n\ny=7 at t=7 earliest.\n\nThus, impossible to have y_{10}=8 without being on y=7 at some unsafe time or causing issue.\n\nTherefore, H=11 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly for less.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nI think I should write the sequence clearly.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the turn indices.\n\nSince t_1=0, so:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nIn the sequence, after Turn 11: U, at next turn, y=9.\n\nSo H=12 turns of actions? From t=0 to t=11, 12 actions.\n\nIn the problem, \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAnd reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=0, so at turn H, position.\n\nIn this case, at turn 12, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the actions must be planned to avoid unsafe times on each freeway.\n\n### Unsafe Times for Freeways:\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5: Always safe, as no car covers position 0 at any turn.\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 0\\).\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 0, 1, 8, 9\\).\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 0, 1, 8, 9\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 0 and must reach \\(y = 9\\) (safe) as quickly as possible. The direct path upward would reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 8, but freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9. To avoid collision, the player must not be on freeways 7 or 8 during turns 8 and 9. The earliest safe turn to be on freeway 7 is turn 10, and on freeway 8 is turn 11.\n\n### Minimal Path:\n- The player can reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 6 (safe).\n- Stay on \\(y = 6\\) (safe) for turns 7, 8, and 9 to avoid freeways 7 and 8 during unsafe times.\n- Move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10 (safe).\n- Move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11 (safe).\n- Move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\nThis requires 12 actions (turns 0 to 11) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 0: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as turn 1 is not unsafe for freeway 1).\n- Turn 1: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 always safe).\n- Turn 2: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 always safe).\n- Turn 3: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 always safe).\n- Turn 4: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 always safe).\n- Turn 5: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at turn 6).\n- Turn 6: Stay to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 7 (safe).\n- Turn 7: Stay to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 8 (safe).\n- Turn 8: Stay to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 9 (safe).\n- Turn 9: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at turn 10).\n- Turn 10: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at turn 11).\n- Turn 11: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no cars).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the target in minimal turns \\(H = 12\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 0\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11\\text{: } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car whose span includes 0 at that exact turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you're still on y_T, so you only check for cars on y_T at turn T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check for cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since we start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, we have to move up through y=2 to y=8, avoiding cars.\n\nMinimal number of turns: since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, the shortest path would be to go up every turn, which would take 8 moves (from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., 8 to 9), so 8 turns? But we start at turn t1=1, and after H turns, we're at turn t1+H-1? Let me clarify the timing.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for actions, but t here is relative. Let's see the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1? After H actions, we've moved H times, so position at time after H actions.\n\nSet t1 = 1.\n\nStart at turn 1, position y=1.\n\nAfter action a1, at turn 2, position y2.\n\nGenerally, at turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want to reach y_t = 9 for some t, specifically at turn t1 + H - 1? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nt1 + H - 1.\n\nSince actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the position after H actions is at time t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nThat seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nBut after actions from t=0 to H-1, that's H actions, applied at times t1 to t1+H-1, so the state after these actions is at time t1 + H.\n\nBut we reach the position at turn t1 + H - 1? That can't be right.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions taken at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter taking action at time t, we move to position at time t+1.\n\nSo at time t1, we start at position given for time t1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at time t1, we are at position y_{t1+1} at time t1+1.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1} at time t1+1, we are at y_{t1+2} at time t1+2.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-1} at time t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H} at time t1+H.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9) at some turn, specifically at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nt1 + H - 1 is the time when we take the last action? No.\n\nAt time t, we have position y_t.\n\nWe take action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is defined at each turn.\n\nWe want y_T = 9 for T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nSo at time T = t1 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, to have y_T = 9, we must have taken actions that bring us to y=9 at time T.\n\nSince we start at time t1 with y=1, we need to go from y=1 at t1 to y=9 at T.\n\nThe number of turns between t1 and T is T - t1 = (t1 + H - 1) - t1 = H - 1 turns? Let's think.\n\nFrom time t1 to time T, there are (T - t1) steps? No.\n\nTime points: t1, t1+1, t1+2, ..., T.\n\nIf T = t1 + K, then there are K time points from t1 to t1+K.\n\nBut from t1 to T, the number of actions taken between them.\n\nAt time t1, we are given.\n\nThen we take action at t1 to go to t1+1.\n\nTake action at t1+1 to go to t1+2, and so on, up to take action at T-1 to go to T.\n\nSo to be at position at time T, we take actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., T-1.\n\nThat's (T - t1) actions.\n\nNow, T = t1 + H - 1, so T - t1 = H - 1.\n\nSo we take H-1 actions: at times t1 to (t1 + H - 2)? Let's set K = T - t1.\n\nThen we take K actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+K-1, to reach position at time t1+K.\n\nBut T = t1 + H - 1, so t1+K = t1 + H - 1, thus K = H - 1.\n\nSo actions at times t1 to t1 + (H-1) - 1 = t1 to t1 + H - 2.\n\nBut the sequence is given as {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which for t from 0 to H-1, so times t1+0 to t1+H-1.\n\nThat would be actions at times t1 to t1+H-1, which affect positions at times t1+1 to t1+H.\n\nBut we want position at time t1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nSo at time t1 + H - 1, y = 9.\n\nBut with actions up to a_{t1+H-1}, that affects y at time t1+H, not at t1+H-1.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" means actions for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAfter taking these actions, the position at time t1+H is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want position at time t1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nSo y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut the actions up to a_{t1+H-2} affect y at t1+H-1, and a_{t1+H-1} affects y at t1+H.\n\nFor y_{t1+H-1} to be 9, it is determined by actions up to a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nThe action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at time t1+H-1, which affects y at t1+H, which is after we have reached y=9 at t1+H-1.\n\nSo for the position at t1+H-1, we only need actions from t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t1+H-1}, which is for the next position.\n\nBut in the context, since we only care about reaching at t1+H-1, the action at t1+H-1 might not be necessary, but we have to specify it as part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect the position at t1+H-1.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns H\" includes the starting point or something.\n\nLet's look at the answer format: \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t1 + H - 1: a_{t1+H-1}\" but for H actions.\n\nBut we reach at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nI think it's better to think that after the sequence, we are at turn t1 + H - 1 with y=9.\n\nSo from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1, there are (t1 + H - 1) - t1 + 1 = H turns? Let's count the turns.\n\nTurns: at time t1, position given.\n\nThen at time t1+1, position after first action.\n\n...\nAt time t1 + H - 1, position after action at t1 + H - 2.\n\nTo have position at time t1 + H - 1, we need actions from t1 to t1 + H - 2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is given for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions, including a_{t1 + H - 1}, which is for time t1 + H - 1, affecting position at t1 + H.\n\nSince we only care about position at t1 + H - 1, a_{t1 + H - 1} can be anything, but we have to include it in the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\", so at that turn, we are there, and the actions up to that point are included.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to set T = t1 + H - 1, and we need y_T = 9.\n\nThen the actions that affect y_T are actions at times t1 to T-1, which are actions at t1, t1+1, ..., T-1.\n\nSince T = t1 + H - 1, so actions at times t1 to (t1 + H - 1) - 1 = t1 to t1 + H - 2.\n\nThat's H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1 for a_{t1+t}, so for t from 0 to H-1, times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo for H actions, times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut for position at T = t1+H-1, we only need actions up to t1+H-2.\n\nSo the action at t1+H-1 is not needed for reaching y=9 at t1+H-1; it could be for staying or moving, but since we are at y=9, we might stay or move down, but we only need to reach, so after reaching, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify a_{t1+H-1}, which could be S or U or D, but if we move, y changes, but at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, and action a_{t1+H-1} determines y at t1+H, which is after, so it doesn't affect the reaching at t1+H-1.\n\nSo for the purpose of reaching, we can set a_{t1+H-1} to S, for example, to stay.\n\nBut the minimal H might be such that we reach at t1+H-1 with y=9, and the last action might be to move up to 9 or stay at 9.\n\nLet's assume that at turn T, y_T = 9, and we can have action at T to stay or move, but the position at T is already 9.\n\nSo for the sequence, we include actions from t1 to T, where T = t1+H-1, but action at T affects y at T+1, not at T.\n\nI think I should just proceed with the car positions and find a path.\n\nStart at turn 1, y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe shortest path is 8 moves up, but we have to avoid cars on y=2 to y=8 at the times we are there.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, but y=1 is our starting point, and we need to be on each freeway at some turn without collision.\n\nAt turn 1, we are on y=1, so we need to check if at turn 1, for freeway y=1, is there a car with 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, when we move to y=2 at some turn, we check at that turn for y=2.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn t1=1.\n\nFreeway k, with cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\n\nDirection: right means right-moving, so span [tau, h] and it increases.\n\nLeft-moving: span [h, tau] and it decreases.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span [h, tau] -> at T, [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span [tau, h] -> at T, [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, 0 in span of some car on that freeway.\n\nNow, at turn 1:\n\nFreeway 1: car (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nRight-moving, so span at time t: [tau + s(t-1), h + s(t-1)]? t1=1.\n\nGeneral: at turn T, for a car given at t1=1.\n\nSo for right-moving car, span at T: [tau + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - s(T-1), tau - s(T-1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in span at T for the freeway we are on at T.\n\nNow, for freeway 1 at turn 1:\n\nCar: h=-45, tau=-56, d=right, s=3\n\nAt T=1, span: [tau + s(1-1), h + s(1-1)] = [ -56 + 3*0, -45 + 3*0] = [-56, -45]\n\n0 not in [-56,-45], so no collision at turn 1 on y=1.\n\nGood, we start safely.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal H: since we start at y=1, to y=9, we need at least 8 up moves, but we might have to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H might be more than 8.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up directly.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway from y=2 to y=8, when we are on it, if at that turn, 0 is not in any car span on that row.\n\nBut we can choose when to be on each row by choosing when to move.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, we have to pass through each integer y.\n\nTo go from y=1 to y=9, we must be on each y from 1 to 9 at some point, but y=9 is the target, and y=0 is not in freeway, so from 1 to 8 we have risks.\n\ny=1 to y=8 have cars, y=9 has no car mentioned, so safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nFirst, list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-45,-56,right,3) — this is y=1\n\nFreeway 2: (60,49,right,12) — y=2\n\nFreeway 3: (60,49,right,12) — y=3\n\nFreeway 4: (60,49,right,12) — y=4\n\nFreeway 5: (60,49,right,12) — y=5\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) — y=6\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6) — y=7\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6) — y=8\n\nAll cars are right-moving, since direction is \"right\".\n\nNow, for each, span at time T:\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail tau, speed s, at time T (from t1=1), span is [tau + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)]\n\nSince at T=1, [tau, h], and increases.\n\n0 in span if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span)\n\nSince [lower, upper], 0 in if lower <= 0 <= upper.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find when 0 is in span for any car on that row.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1): only one car: tau = -56, h = -45, s=3\n\nSpan at T: [ -56 + 3(T-1), -45 + 3(T-1) ]\n\nSet lower = -56 + 3(T-1), upper = -45 + 3(T-1)\n\n0 in span if lower <= 0 <= upper\n\n-56 + 3(T-1) <= 0 and 0 <= -45 + 3(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: -56 + 3(T-1) <= 0 => 3(T-1) <= 56 => T-1 <= 56/3 ≈ 18.666, so T <= 19.666, since T integer, T <= 19\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -45 + 3(T-1) => 45 <= 3(T-1) => 15 <= T-1 => T >= 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 in span on freeway 1.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): car (60,49,right,12)\n\ntau=49? Head h=60, tail tau=49? For right-moving, tail should be less than head, but here tail=49, head=60, so tau=49, h=60, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 12(T-1), 60 + 12(T-1)]\n\nLower = 49 + 12(T-1), upper = 60 + 12(T-1)\n\n0 in span if lower <= 0 <= upper\n\nBut lower = 49 + 12(T-1) >= 49 >0 for T>=1, so lower >0, 0 not <= upper? 0 < lower <= upper, so 0 not in span, since span is positive.\n\nSimilarly, upper >0, so 0 not in [lower,upper] because lower >0.\n\nSo for all T, no collision on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car (60,49,right,12), identical to freeway 2, so also always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) same as above, span [49+12(T-1), 60+12(T-1)] >0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), so h=12, tau=1, s=12? Tail tau=1, head h=12.\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 12(T-1), 12 + 12(T-1)]\n\nLower = 1 + 12(T-1), upper = 12 + 12(T-1)\n\nFor T=1, [1 +0, 12+0] = [1,12], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nFor T>1, lower increases, so always lower >=1 >0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus for freeway 6, both cars never have 0 in span, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-42,-53,right,6) — tail tau=-53, head h=-42? Given as (head, tail) = (-42,-53), but for right-moving, tail should be left, so tau=-53, h=-42.\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\" so head first, then tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end, so h > tau.\n\nHere, for first car: h=-42, tau=-53, so h > tau since -42 > -53.\n\ns=6.\n\nSpan at T: [tau + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-53 + 6(T-1), -42 + 6(T-1)]\n\nLower = -53 + 6(T-1), upper = -42 + 6(T-1)\n\n0 in span if lower <= 0 <= upper\n\nFirst: -53 + 6(T-1) <= 0 => 6(T-1) <= 53 => T-1 <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so T <= 9.833, T <= 9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 + 6(T-1) => 42 <= 6(T-1) => 7 <= T-1 => T >= 8\n\nSo for T=8 and T=9, 0 in span for this car.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (6,-5,right,6) — head h=6, tail tau=-5? tau=-5, h=6.\n\nSpan at T: [tau + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [-5 + 6(T-1), 6 + 6(T-1)]\n\nLower = -5 + 6(T-1), upper = 6 + 6(T-1)\n\n0 in span if lower <= 0 <= upper\n\nFirst: -5 + 6(T-1) <= 0 => 6(T-1) <= 5 => T-1 <= 5/6 ≈ 0.833, so T <= 1.833, T <= 1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6 + 6(T-1) always true since min upper is 6>0? At T=1, upper=6, so 0 <=6 true.\n\nBut for T=1: lower = -5 +0 = -5 <=0, upper=6 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor T>1, lower = -5 +6(T-1), for T=2, lower= -5+6=1>0, so 0 not <= lower? lower >=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for second car, 0 in span only at T=1.\n\nNow for freeway 7, at turn T, collision if either car has 0 in span.\n\nSo at T=1, second car has 0 in span, so collision if on y=7 at T=1.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, first car has 0 in span.\n\nAt other times, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 (y=8): same cars as freeway 7, since \"(-42,-53,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\" identical.\n\nSo same as y=7: collision at T=1 (from second car), and at T=8,9 (from first car).\n\nNow back to freeway 1: collision at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nWe start at turn 1, y=1, which is safe as we saw.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5,6 are always safe, no cars cause collision there.\n\ny=2 to y=6 are safe at all times.\n\ny=1 has danger at T=16-19.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have danger at T=1,8,9.\n\nT=1 is now, but we are not on y=7 or 8 at T=1, so no problem.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 and y=8 at some turns, but not when collision happens.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7: avoid T=1,8,9\n\nSimilarly y=8: avoid T=1,8,9\n\ny=1: avoid T=16-19\n\nBut we start at T=1 on y=1, which is safe.\n\nTo go from y=1 to y=9, minimal turns: we can go up every turn, from T=1 y=1, to T=2 y=2, ..., up to T=8 y=8, then T=9 y=9.\n\nBut at T=8, if we are on y=8, there is collision on y=8 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9 on y=8, collision.\n\nIn this path: at T=1, y=1\n\nAction U: to y=2 at T=2\n\nU: to y=3 at T=3\n\nU: to y=4 at T=4\n\nU: to y=5 at T=5\n\nU: to y=6 at T=6\n\nU: to y=7 at T=7\n\nNow at T=7, on y=7.\n\nIs y=7 safe at T=7?\n\nFrom above, for y=7, danger at T=1,8,9. T=7 not in, so safe.\n\nThen from T=7 y=7, action U to y=8 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, on y=8, which has collision at T=8, as per above.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at T=8, collision.\n\nIf we stay or something.\n\nFrom T=7 y=7, if we do not go up, but stay or down.\n\nBut we need to go to y=8 eventually.\n\nAt T=7 on y=7, safe.\n\nNow if we go U at T=7, to y=8 at T=8, but y=8 at T=8 has collision.\n\nIf we do S at T=7, stay on y=7 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, on y=7, but y=7 has collision at T=8, so unsafe.\n\nIf we go D at T=7, to y=6 at T=8.\n\nBut y=6 is safe, but we are going down.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo at T=7, we cannot stay or go down if we want minimal path.\n\nBut going up to y=8 at T=8 causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we delay.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster or slower.\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSince y=2 to y=6 are always safe, we can stay there if needed.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but we have issues at y=7 and y=8.\n\nSpecifically, y=7 is safe only at times not 1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe only not at 1,8,9.\n\nT=1 is past, so for future, avoid T=8,9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nAlso, y=1 has danger at T=16-19, but since we start at T=1 and can move up early, probably we can avoid that.\n\nNow, to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so safe at all times.\n\nBut we need to be on y=9 at turn T.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nWe start T=1, y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 safe always.\n\ny=7 safe except T=8,9\n\ny=8 safe except T=8,9\n\ny=1 safe except T=16-19, but we leave early.\n\nSince we are at y=1 T=1, safe.\n\nNow, if we go up each turn:\n\nT=1: y=1\n\na1=U: T=2 y=2\n\na2=U: T=3 y=3\n\na3=U: T=4 y=4\n\na4=U: T=5 y=5\n\na5=U: T=6 y=6\n\na6=U: T=7 y=7 → safe, since T=7 not 8 or 9\n\nNow at T=7 y=7, we want to go to y=8.\n\nBut if we go U at T=7, to y=8 at T=8, but T=8 y=8 collision.\n\nIf we go S at T=7, to y=7 at T=8, but T=8 y=7 collision.\n\nIf we go D at T=7, to y=6 at T=8, safe, but then we are at y=6, need to go up again.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we need to be on y=7 at a time when we can stay or move, but y=7 is unsafe at T=8, so we cannot be on y=7 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on y=8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nNow, what about T=10? y=7 and y=8 safe at T=10, since danger only T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, T=7 safe for y=7.\n\nSo at T=7, we are on y=7, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=8, but not at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSo we can go to y=8 at T=10 or later.\n\nBut how?\n\nFrom T=7 y=7, if we go U at T=7, to y=8 at T=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we don't go U, we have to stay or go down.\n\nSuppose at T=7 y=7, we go S, but at T=8 we are on y=7, which is unsafe at T=8.\n\nGo D to y=6 at T=8.\n\ny=6 at T=8 is safe, since y=6 always safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWe can be on y=7 only at T<=7 or T>=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow at T=7, we can be on y=7 safely.\n\nThen, to go to y=8, we need to be on y=8 at some T not 8 or 9.\n\nFor example, at T=10.\n\nBut how to get from y=7 at T=7 to y=8 at T=10.\n\nFrom T=7 to T=10, we need to spend 3 turns to increase y by 1, which requires moving down or staying.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=7, y=7, instead of going U, we go D to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=6, we can go S or U or D.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nIf we go U at T=8, to y=7 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7: is it safe? y=7 unsafe at T=9, collision.\n\nSo cannot go to y=7 at T=9.\n\nIf we go S at T=8, stay y=6 at T=9.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at T=9, y=6, go U to y=7 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=7 safe (since T=10 not 8 or 9).\n\nThen from T=10 y=7, go U to y=8 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=8 safe (T=11 not 8 or 9).\n\nThen go U to y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at T=12.\n\nFrom start: T=1 to T=12, so H-1=11? T= t1 + H -1 =12, t1=1, so 1 + H -1 =12, thus H=12.\n\nBut we started at T=1 y=1, after actions, at T=12 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=1 to T=11, actions a1 to a11, to reach at T=12.\n\nT= t1 + H -1 =12, t1=1, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nSequence from a1 to a11? Let's list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but t1=1, so actions a_{1} to a_{1+H-1} = a_{1} to a_{H}\n\nBut we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps for H=12, actions at t1 to t1+H-1 =1 to 12? t1+H-1=1+12-1=12.\n\nActions at times 1 to 12? But action at time 12 affects y at 13, not needed.\n\nI think I need to define H properly.\n\nSet T_reach = t1 + H -1\n\nWe reach y=9 at T_reach.\n\nThe actions taken are at times t1 to T_reach -1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at T, actions at 1 to T-1.\n\nWith T = T_reach.\n\nIn this case, with T=12, actions from 1 to 11.\n\nThe sequence has H actions? H should be the number of actions.\n\nIn the answer, it shows \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" to \"Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\", so for H actions.\n\nBut to reach at turn t1+H-1, with H actions, it means actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and position at t1+H-1 is after action at t1+H-2? Messy.\n\nAssume that with H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with no action, at turn t1, we are at start, but we take actions to move.\n\nIn this path: from T=1 to T=12.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, take action to go to next.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=12, we need to have taken actions that bring us there.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nT=1: y=1, take a1 (say U) to go to y=2 at T=2\n\n...\n\nUp to T=7: y=7, take a7 (D?) in my detour.\n\nList the turns and positions.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T (determines y_{T+1})\n\nStart: T=1, y=1\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nIn the direct up except delay for y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt T=1: y=1, can go U to y=2 at T=2\n\nT=2: y=2, go U to y=3 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=3, go U to y=4 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=4, go U to y=5 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=5, go U to y=6 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=6, go U to y=7 at T=7  (safe, T=7)\n\nNow T=7: y=7, we cannot go U immediately because then y=8 at T=8 unsafe.\n\nInstead, go D to y=6 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=6, now at T=8, y=6 safe. Instead of going U to y=7 at T=9, which is unsafe, go S to stay y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=6, go U to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=7 (safe, T=10), go U to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11: y=8 (safe, T=11), go U to y=9 at T=12\n\nT=12: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at T=12.\n\nActions taken at T=1 to T=11: a1 to a11.\n\na1: U (to y=2)\n\na2: U (to y=3)\n\na3: U (to y=4)\n\na4: U (to y=5)\n\na5: U (to y=6)\n\na6: U (to y=7)\n\na7: D (to y=6 at T=8)  // at T=7, action D\n\na8: S (to y=6 at T=9)  // at T=8, action S\n\na9: U (to y=7 at T=10)  // at T=9, action U\n\na10: U (to y=8 at T=11)  // at T=10, action U\n\na11: U (to y=9 at T=12)  // at T=11, action U\n\nAt T=12, we are at y=9.\n\nReached at turn T=12 = t1 + H -1 =1 + H -1, so H=12.\n\nSequence: actions from a1 to a11, which is 11 actions? t from 0 to H-1=11, so 12 actions? Index.\n\nSequence {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nt1=1, so a_{1+0} = a1, a_{1+1}=a2, ..., a_{1+(H-1)} = a_{H}\n\nBut we have actions up to a11 for T=11, to reach at T=12.\n\na_{1} to a_{11}, that's 11 actions.\n\nH-1 =11? t from 0 to H-1, that's H terms.\n\nFor t=0 to H-1, actions at times t1+0 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith t1=1, times 1 to 1+H-1.\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, actions at 1 to (1+H-1) =1 to H, but we need to reach at turn H? t1+H-1.\n\nSet t1+H-1 =12, t1=1, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions at times t1 to t1+H-1 =1 to 1+12-1=1 to 12? t1+H-1=12, but actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1 to t1+H-1 is from 1 to 12 for H=12.\n\nBut action at time 12 affects y at 13, which is after we reached at 12.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify action at time 12, but since we are at y=9 at T=12, we can set a12 to S or something.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we don't need to take action after reaching.\n\nBut the sequence must include H actions, up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIn this case, with H=12, actions from a1 to a12.\n\nBut a12 is for after we reached.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nH=12 seems high, but with the detour.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nFor example, can we be on y=7 earlier or later.\n\nWe were on y=7 at T=7, which is safe.\n\nThen instead of going down, can we stay on y=6 longer or something.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 and stay there until it's safe to go to y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe only at T=8,9, so safe at T=7,10,11,...\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nAt T=6, y=6, we can go U to y=7 at T=7, safe.\n\nThen at T=7, instead of going to y=8, we can stay on y=7, but at T=8, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot stay.\n\nGo down to y=6 at T=8, as before.\n\nPerhaps go up to y=8 at T=7? But from y=7 to y=8 in one step, not possible, must go through y=7 first.\n\nWe have to be on y=7 at some point to go to y=8.\n\nUnless we go directly, but no, y changes by at most 1.\n\nSo we must be on y=7 at some turn, then on y=8 at some later turn.\n\nThe critical point is that we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nIn the path above, we are on y=7 at T=7 and T=10.\n\nOn y=8 at T=11.\n\nT=10 y=7 to T=11 y=8.\n\nNow, can we be on y=7 at an earlier time?\n\nFor example, at T=7 is the earliest we can be on y=7 if we go up directly.\n\nT=1 y=1, T=2 y=2, ..., T=7 y=7.\n\nCould we reach y=7 later? But that would take more turns.\n\nAt T=7 y=7 is fine.\n\nBut then we have to wait until T=10 to be on y=7 again? No, at T=7 we are on y=7, we move away, then come back at T=10.\n\nBut we don't need to come back to y=7; we can go to y=8 directly from another row, but no, must go through y=7.\n\nFrom y=6, we go to y=7.\n\nIn the detour, we go down to y=6 at T=8, stay at T=9, then up to y=7 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=9, we are at y=6, we could go to y=7 at T=10, which is safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=11.\n\nBut y=8 at T=11 is safe.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=8 at T=10 or something.\n\nBut y=8 at T=10 is safe.\n\nHow to be on y=8 at T=10.\n\nFrom where?\n\nTo be on y=8 at T=10, we must have been on y=7 or y=9 at T=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + delta y_9\n\nSo at T=9, we must be on y=7,8, or9, and take action to y=8.\n\nIf on y=7 at T=9, action D to y=8? But y=7 at T=9 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf on y=8 at T=9, action S to y=8, but y=8 at T=9 unsafe.\n\nIf on y=9 at T=9, action D to y=8, but we not yet at y=9.\n\nSo cannot be on y=8 at T=10 if we are not on y=7,8,9 at T=9, but all problematic.\n\nSpecifically, to be on y=8 at T=10, we must have:\n\n- At T=9, on y=7 and take U, or on y=8 and take S, or on y=9 and take D.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7 and y=8 are both unsafe, so we cannot be on them.\n\ny=9 might be safe, but we are not there yet.\n\nSo it's impossible to be on y=8 at T=10, because it requires being on y=7,8,9 at T=9, but y=7 and y=8 unsafe at T=9, and y=9 not reached.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=8 at T=9 for the same reason.\n\nNow, for T=11: to be on y=8 at T=11.\n\nWe must be at T=10 on y=7,8,9 and take appropriate action.\n\nAt T=10, y=7 is safe (as T=10 not 8 or 9), y=8 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nIf on y=7 at T=10, take U to y=8 at T=11.\n\nIf on y=8 at T=10, take S to y=8 at T=11.\n\nIf on y=9 at T=10, take D to y=8 at T=11, but inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=8 at T=11 from y=7 at T=10.\n\nNow, back to minimizing turns.\n\nIn the path I had, we reach y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=8 at T=10 or earlier, but we saw T=10 not possible.\n\nT=7: on y=7, safe.\n\nIf we could go to y=8 at T=7, but cannot, must take action to change y.\n\nAt T=7, we take action, go to y=6,7, or8 at T=8.\n\nBut y=7 at T=8 unsafe, y=8 at T=8 unsafe, so only possible to go to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=6, we can go to y=5,6,7 at T=9.\n\nBut y=7 at T=9 unsafe, so we can go to y=5 or y=6 or stay y=6.\n\nIf go to y=7 at T=9, unsafe.\n\nSo we must go to y=5 or y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen from there, to y=7 later.\n\nBut y=7 safe at T=10, for example.\n\nAt T=8 y=6, go S to y=6 at T=9 (safe, y=6 always safe)\n\nThen at T=9 y=6, go U to y=7 at T=10 (safe)\n\nThen at T=10 y=7, go U to y=8 at T=11 (safe)\n\nThen at T=11 y=8, go U to y=9 at T=12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=8 y=6, go D to y=5 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9 y=5, go U to y=6 at T=10, etc., but takes more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal to go to y=6 at T=9, then proceed.\n\nThus the path I have seems minimal in terms of time to reach y=9.\n\nBut we reached at T=12.\n\nNow, what about the danger at y=1 for T=16-19? But since we are moving up quickly, we are not on y=1 after T=1, so no issue.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nt1=1, H=12, reach at turn t1 + H -1 =1+12-1=12.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=11, so actions a_{1+0} to a_{1+11}? t from 0 to 11, times 1 to 12.\n\nBut action at time 12 is not needed, but we have to include it.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1 + t, t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=12, t=0 to 11, turns: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nActions at these turns.\n\nBut at turn 12, we are at y=12? No, position at turn T is before action or after?\n\nClarify.\n\nAt each turn T, we are at position y_T, then we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the output, it says \"Turn t: a_t\" meaning action taken at turn t.\n\nAnd we reach position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 12, we are at position y=9, and we take some action, say S, to stay or whatever.\n\nBut since we reached at turn 12, the action at turn 12 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions from a1 to a11.\n\na1 to a11 are actions at T=1 to 11.\n\nBut for H=12, the sequence should include a12.\n\nSo we need to specify a12.\n\nSince at T=12, we are at y=9, we can set a12 to S, to stay at y=9.\n\nIn the path, at T=11, we go to y=9 at T=12, then at T=12, we take a12=S to stay.\n\nBut we already reached at T=12, so a12 is not necessary for reaching, but we have to include it in the sequence.\n\nTo minimize H, we might not need extra action.\n\nIn this case, with actions up to a11, we are at y=9 at T=12.\n\nIf we set H=11, reach at turn t1+H-1=1+11-1=11.\n\nBut with 11 actions? Actions from t=0 to H-1=10, times 1 to 11? t from 0 to 10, times 1 to 11.\n\nReach at turn 11.\n\nCan we reach by turn 11?\n\nThat means y_{11} =9.\n\nFrom start y=1 at T=1, to y=9 at T=11, that requires increasing y by 8 in 10 steps? From T=1 to T=11, there are 10 intervals, 10 actions.\n\nPosition at T=1: y=1\n\nAfter 10 actions, position at T=11.\n\ny_{11} = y_1 + sum of delta y from t=1 to 10.\n\ny_1=1, y_11=9, so sum delta y = 8.\n\nSince each |delta y| <=1, minimal actions to increase by 8 is 8 up moves, but we have 10 actions, so we can have 8 up and 2 other moves, like stay or down.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, to reach by T=11.\n\ny_{11}=9.\n\nWe need to be on intermediate rows.\n\nBut the problem is y=7 and y=8 at forbidden times.\n\nSpecifically, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nNow, at T=11, y=9.\n\nThen at T=10, we must have been on y=8 or y=9 or y=10, but y=10 invalid, so on y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf on y=8 at T=10, action U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nIf on y=9 at T=10, action S to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, for y=10, etc.\n\nBut we need to see the path.\n\nSuppose we want y=9 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=10, we must be on y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf on y=9 at T=10, then we need to reach y=9 earlier, which might not help.\n\nSo better to be on y=8 at T=10, then U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, at T=10, on y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=10 is safe, since not T=8 or 9.\n\nNow, to be on y=8 at T=10.\n\nAt T=9, we must be on y=7,8,9 and take action to y=8.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=9.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to be on y=9 at T=9, then take D to y=8 at T=10.\n\nBut y=9 at T=9: is it possible? And take D down, which is inefficient.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 by T=9.\n\ny=9 at T=9.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=1 to y=9 at T=9, that requires sum delta y = 8 in 8 actions? Positions: T=1 y=1, after 8 actions, at T=9.\n\ny_9 = y_1 + sum_{t=1 to 8} delta y_t = 1 + sum =9, so sum=8.\n\nWith 8 actions, we need all U, no S or D.\n\nBut can we go up all the way?\n\nT=1 y=1, a1=U to y=2 T=2\n\na2=U to y=3 T=3\n\na3=U to y=4 T=4\n\na4=U to y=5 T=5\n\na5=U to y=6 T=6\n\na6=U to y=7 T=7\n\nNow T=7 y=7, a7=U to y=8 T=8\n\nBut at T=8, y=8 collision.\n\nIf at T=7, we do not go U, but S or D, then we cannot reach y=8 by T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=7 y=7, if a7=S, to y=7 T=8, but y=7 at T=8 collision.\n\nIf a7=D, to y=6 T=8, then at T=8 y=6, a8=U to y=7 T=9, but y=7 at T=9 collision.\n\nThus, with all up, we cannot avoid collision at T=8 or T=9 if we are on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSpecifically, to be on y=8 at T=8 requires being on y=7 at T=7 and U, but y=8 at T=8 unsafe.\n\nCannot be on y=8 at T=9 directly without being on y=7 or y=8 at T=9, unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 by T=9 or earlier with only up moves.\n\nWith other moves, but to reach y=9 by T=9, we need exactly 8 up moves in 8 actions, no other choice.\n\nBut as above, not possible due to collision.\n\nSimilarly, to reach by T=10.\n\ny=9 at T=10.\n\nThen from T=1 to T=10, 9 actions? Position at T=10.\n\ny_10 =1 + sum_{t=1 to9} delta y_t =9, so sum delta y =8.\n\nThus 8 up and one other, say one S or one D.\n\nNow, the other move could be a stay or down.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nNow, suppose we go up with one extra move.\n\nFor example, at some point, we stay instead of moving up.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nT=1: y=1\n\nSuppose we go U each turn except one.\n\nBut where to insert the extra move.\n\nIf we insert a stay early, say at T=2 or something, but then we reach later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at T=1, then y=1 at T=2, then go up, but y=1 at T=2 might be safe? y=1 danger only at T=16-19, so at T=2 safe, but staying delays.\n\nTo reach faster, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut at T=7, if we go to y=7, then we have to deal with T=8.\n\nSuppose at T=6, y=6, instead of going U to y=7 at T=7, we stay at T=6: a6=S, so at T=7 y=6.\n\nThen at T=7, y=6, go U to y=7 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, y=7 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=6 y=6, go D to y=5 at T=7.\n\nThen at T=7 y=5, go U to y=6 at T=8, etc., worse.\n\nSo not helpful.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 at T=10 directly from earlier, but we need to be on y=6 first.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 to y=6 are safe, we can stay on them to kill time until it's safe.\n\nFor example, stay on y=6 from some turn until T=9, then go to y=7 at T=10.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nEarliest to be on y=6: at T=6, if we go up directly.\n\nT=1 y=1 U to T=2 y=2 U to T=3 y=3 U to T=4 y=4 U to T=5 y=5 U to T=6 y=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=6.\n\nNow, we can stay on y=6 for multiple turns.\n\nBut we need to go to y=7 when safe, e.g., at T=10.\n\nSo at T=6, y=6, take a6=S to y=6 at T=7\n\na7=S to y=6 at T=8\n\na8=S to y=6 at T=9\n\nNow at T=9, y=6, take a9=U to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10 y=7, take a10=U to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11 y=8, take a11=U to y=9 at T=12\n\nSame as before, reach at T=12.\n\nBut we used stays at T=6,7,8, whereas in the first path, we used down and stay at T=7 and T=8.\n\nIn first path: at T=7, action D to y=6 at T=8\n\nThen at T=8, action S to y=6 at T=9\n\nThen a9 U to y=7 T=10, etc.\n\nHere with stays: at T=6, S to stay y=6 T=7\n\nT=7, S to y=6 T=8\n\nT=8, S to y=6 T=9\n\nThen U to y=7 T=10, etc.\n\nBut we reached y=6 at T=6, and stayed until T=9, then moved up.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, still at T=12.\n\nBut we started moving up later.\n\nIn the first path, we were at y=7 at T=7, then down to y=6, then stay, then up.\n\nHere, we stayed at y=6 from T=6 to T=9.\n\nBut T=6 to T=9 is 4 turns at y=6, but we only need to avoid T=8 and T=9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nBy staying at y=6 until T=9, we go to y=7 at T=10, y=8 at T=11, y=9 at T=12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan we go to y=7 earlier? But if we go at T=7, we have the problem.\n\nUnless we can be on y=7 at T=10 without staying long.\n\nBut T=10 is the safe time.\n\nThe minimal T to reach y=9 is 12, as above.\n\nPerhaps 11.\n\ny=9 at T=11.\n\nThen as before, to be on y=8 at T=10 or y=9 at T=10.\n\nIf on y=9 at T=10, then we need y=9 at T=10.\n\ny=10 at T=10: from y=1 at T=1, to y=9 at T=10, 9 actions, sum delta y=8, so one stay or one down.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=10, we must be on y=8 or y=9 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=8 and y=7 unsafe, so only possibility is y=9 at T=9.\n\nBut y=9 at T=9: with 8 actions from T=1 to T=9, y_9 =1 + sum_{t=1 to 8} delta y_t =9, so sum=8, all U, but as before, we cannot because of collision at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSpecifically, to be on y=9 at T=9, we must be on y=8 at T=8 and U, but y=8 at T=8 unsafe.\n\nIf we are on y=9 at T=8, then U or S, but to be on y=9 at T=8, even earlier, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 before T=12.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12, with actions as before.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for H=12, actions from t=0 to 11, times t1=1 to 12.\n\nBut action at time 12 is not needed, but we can set it to S.\n\nIn the path, actions at T=1 to T=11, but for the sequence, we need up to a12.\n\nSo let's list:\n\nTurn 1: a1 = U  (to y=2)\n\nBut at turn 1, we take action to go to next position.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t: a_t\"\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: U  (action to move to y=2 at next turn)\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U  (to y=7 at T=7)\n\nNow at T=7, we need action: in first path, D\n\nTurn 7: D  (to y=6 at T=8)\n\nTurn 8: S  (to y=6 at T=9)\n\nTurn 9: U  (to y=7 at T=10)\n\nTurn 10: U  (to y=8 at T=11)\n\nTurn 11: U  (to y=9 at T=12)\n\nNow for turn 12, we need to specify action. Since at T=12, y=9, we can set a12=S to stay.\n\nBut we reached at turn 12, so action at turn 12 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be included.\n\nTo have exactly H actions.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 1 at T=16-19, but we are not on y=1 after T=1, so no issue.\n\nNow, confirm the positions:\n\nT=1: y=1, take U\n\nT=2: y=2, take U\n\nT=3: y=3, take U\n\nT=4: y=4, take U\n\nT=5: y=5, take U\n\nT=6: y=6, take U → to y=7 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=7, take D → to y=6 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=6, take S → to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=6, take U → to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=7, take U → to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11: y=8, take U → to y=9 at T=12\n\nT=12: y=9, take S (say) → to y=9 at T=13, but we don't care.\n\nAt T=12, we are at y=9, reached.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, there was a car (12,1,right,12), but at T=1, span [1,12], 0 not in, and for other T, not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIn the output, we need the sequence for turns starting from t1=1.\n\nH=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S  (or whatever, but S to stay)\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nSince we need minimal H, and this seems minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going down.\n\nFor example, at T=7 y=7, instead of going down, can we go up but skip the collision by being on different row.\n\nBut no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=7 and y=8 are symmetric in danger times, but we have to cross both.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at T=7? No, cannot.\n\nI think H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nFor turn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nIn the output, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, same as 7.\n\nNow, I think this should work.\n\nBut at T=7, when we go D from y=7 to y=6, at T=7 we are on y=7, which is safe, then we move to y=6 at T=8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the reaching turn: at turn 12, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =1 +12 -1=12, yes.\n\nNow, the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn 1 to 12.\n\nActions as above.\n\nFor the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Times\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Car at \\((-45, -56, \\text{right}, 3)\\).  \n  Collision occurs at turns 16, 17, 18, 19. Safe at all other times, including turn 1.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Car at \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\).  \n  Span is always positive, so no collision at any turn.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Car at \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\).  \n  Identical to freeway 2, always safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Car at \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\).  \n  Identical to freeway 2, always safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Car at \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\).  \n  Identical to freeway 2, always safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Cars at \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\) and \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\).  \n  Both spans are always positive, so no collision at any turn.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Cars at \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\) and \\((6, -5, \\text{right}, 6)\\).  \n  Collision occurs at turns 1, 8, and 9. Safe at all other times.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Cars at \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\) and \\((6, -5, \\text{right}, 6)\\).  \n  Identical to freeway 7, collision at turns 1, 8, and 9. Safe at all other times.\n\nThe player starts at turn 1, position (0, 1), which is safe. Freeways 2 to 6 are always safe, but freeways 7 and 8 must be avoided at turns 8 and 9. The minimal path to y=9 requires 8 upward moves, but due to the collision constraints on y=7 and y=8, a detour is necessary to avoid these freeways at turns 8 and 9.\n\n### Path to Reach y=9 in Minimal Turns\n- **Turn 1 to 6**: Move up directly to y=6 by turn 6. This is safe since freeways 1 to 6 are safe at these turns.\n- **Turn 7**: At y=7 (safe, as turn 7 is not 8 or 9). Move down to y=6 to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at turn 8.\n- **Turn 8**: At y=6 (safe). Stay to avoid moving to y=7 at turn 9 (unsafe).\n- **Turn 9**: At y=6 (safe). Move up to y=7 at turn 10 (safe, as turn 10 is not 8 or 9).\n- **Turn 10**: At y=7 (safe). Move up to y=8 at turn 11 (safe, as turn 11 is not 8 or 9).\n- **Turn 11**: At y=8 (safe). Move up to y=9 at turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: At y=9 (target reached). Stay to remain at y=9.\n\nThis path reaches y=9 at turn 12 with \\(H = 12\\) turns (actions from turn 1 to 12). The number of turns \\(H\\) is minimal because:\n- Reaching y=9 before turn 12 is impossible due to collisions on y=7 and y=8 at turns 8 and 9.\n- Specifically, to reach by turn 11 (y=9 at turn 11) requires being on y=8 at turn 10 or y=9 at turn 10. However, being on y=8 at turn 10 requires being on y=7, y=8, or y=9 at turn 9. But y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at turn 9, and y=9 at turn 9 is unreachable without collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 1 to 12 (H=12) is:\n- Turn 1: U (move up to y=2 at turn 2)\n- Turn 2: U (move up to y=3 at turn 3)\n- Turn 3: U (move up to y=4 at turn 4)\n- Turn 4: U (move up to y=5 at turn 5)\n- Turn 5: U (move up to y=6 at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: U (move up to y=7 at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: D (move down to y=6 at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: S (stay at y=6 at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move up to y=7 at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move up to y=8 at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move up to y=9 at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: S (stay at y=9 at turn 13; not necessary for reaching but included for sequence)\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 12 without collisions, with minimal H=12.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 2, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the same as the y-coordinate) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nNote: When moving from y to y' at turn T, we are on freeway y at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T). Then at the next turn we are on freeway y'. So we do not check the freeway we are moving to until the next turn.\n\nWe are starting at y=2 at turn 2. We must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe car state is given for each freeway k (from 1 to 8). Note that freeways 1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to y=8.\n\nFor each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). The update rule:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire span moves left by s*(T-t1) from the initial state at t1=2.\n- Right-moving: the car moves right by s*(T-t1).\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving is given with head and tail? Actually, the problem says:\n  For left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  For right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the notation for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but then the span is [τ, h] meaning that the tail is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So the initial representation in the table might be (head, tail) but we have to interpret based on direction.\n\nLooking at the table:\nFor freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) -> so for right-moving, the span at t1=2 is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? But wait, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nThe problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning that the tail is at the left and head at the right? So if we have (head, tail) = (-42, -53) and direction right, then we have to form the span as [tail, head] = [-53, -42]? But note that -53 < -42, so the car spans from -53 to -42? Then at time T, the span becomes [ -53 + 3*(T-2), -42 + 3*(T-2) ].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we would have [h, τ] and then subtract. But there are no left-moving cars in this state.\n\nSo let's reinterpret the car data:\n\nFor each car, the tuple is (head, tail, direction, speed). But the span is defined as:\n- If direction is 'right', then the initial span at t1=2 is [min, max] = [tail, head] if tail < head? But wait, the problem says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning τ is the left end and h is the right end? However, in the example for freeway 1: head=-42, tail=-53. Since -53 < -42, then if we let τ = -53 and h = -42, then the span is [-53, -42]. Then at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-53 + 3*(T-2), -42 + 3*(T-2)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: two cars. First car: (-48,-59,right,12) -> span at t1: [-59, -48]. Second car: (24,13,right,12) -> but 13<24, so span at t1: [13,24]. Then at time T, first car: [-59+12*(T-2), -48+12*(T-2)], second car: [13+12*(T-2), 24+12*(T-2)].\n\nBut note: the second car on freeway 6: head=24, tail=13? Then the span is [13,24] and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8: \n  First car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> span at t1: [-47, -36]\n  Second car: (12,1,right,6) -> span at t1: [1,12]\n\nNow, we are at turn 2. We start at y=2. We must avoid being at a freeway k at turn T when the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are allowed to move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We can only move to adjacent rows? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and Δy is either -1,0,1. So we can only move to adjacent rows or stay.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The grid rows are 0 to 9. So we start at 2 and need to get to 9, which requires 7 steps upward. But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways we step on at each turn.\n\nImportant: We cannot leave the grid: y must be in [0,9]. So we can go to row 0 or 9 and stay there? But note that we start at 2 and need to get to 9.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions from turn 2 (current) until we reach 9.\n\nLet t = 0 correspond to turn t1=2. So at step t (from 0 to H-1), we are at turn 2+t.\n\nWe start at y_0 = 2 (at turn 2). Then at turn 2+t, we are at position y_t.\n\nWe must have y_H = 9 for the first time at some turn 2+H (so at the end of H actions, we are at 9).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: so the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. And the position after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) should be 9.\n\nSo after H actions (starting at turn 2, then turn 3, ... up to turn 2+H-1), we are at turn 2+H-1 and y=9.\n\nWe are to minimize H.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and check for collisions at each freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe have freeways 1 to 8 (rows 1 to 8). Row 0 and 9 have no cars? So if we are at row 0 or 9, we don't have to worry about cars? But the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So at row 0 or 9, we are safe.\n\nBut note: we start at row 2 (which is freeway 2? Actually, freeway k corresponds to row k? The freeways are labeled by k=1,...,8 for rows 1 to 8. So row 0 and 9 are safe.\n\nOur goal is to get to row 9.\n\nWe can move up, down, or stay. We want minimal turns, so we want to go up as much as possible. However, we must avoid the cars on the rows 1 to 8 at the times we are on them.\n\nLet me write the car positions as functions of time (turn T, starting at T=2).\n\nFor each freeway k and each car on it, we have the span at time T (T>=2) as:\n\nFor a right-moving car (d='right') with initial (head, tail) at T=2: \n   left_end(T) = tail + s*(T-2)\n   right_end(T) = head + s*(T-2)\n\nFor left-moving, but we don't have any.\n\nNow, we are at (0, y) at turn T. We are on freeway k = y (if y is between 1 and 8). Then we have a collision if for any car on freeway y at turn T, the span covers 0? That is, if for that car: left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T).\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nWe start at T=2, y=2. We are on freeway 2. So we check freeway 2 at T=2.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> so at T=2: \n   left_end = -59 + 12*(0) = -59\n   right_end = -48 + 12*(0) = -48\n   So the car is from -59 to -48. Does it cover 0? -59 <= 0 <= -48? No, because 0 is greater than -48? Actually, -48 < 0? Then 0 is not in [-59, -48]? Actually, the span is [-59, -48] and 0 is not in that interval? Correct.\n\nSo at T=2, we are safe at y=2.\n\nNow, we choose an action at T=2: U (up to 3), D (down to 1), or S (stay at 2). We want to minimize H, so we prefer moving up.\n\nBut we have to check the next state.\n\nWe are going to consider a BFS or Dijkstra in terms of (time, y) but note that time is linear and we are moving step by step. We can simulate forward.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we try to go up as fast as possible, but if blocked we might have to wait or go down.\n\nWe have to compute the positions of the cars for each freeway at each future turn.\n\nNote: The cars move continuously. We need to check for each turn T (integer) and for the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-42, -53, right, 3) -> \n   T: left = -53 + 3*(T-2), right = -42 + 3*(T-2)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> \n   T: left = -59 + 12*(T-2), right = -48 + 12*(T-2)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? one car: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars:\n   Car1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> same as above.\n   Car2: (24, 13, right, 12) -> note: head=24, tail=13 -> so for right-moving, the initial span at T=2 is [13,24]. Then at T: left = 13 + 12*(T-2), right = 24 + 12*(T-2)\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n   Car1: (-36, -47, right, 6) -> initial span: [-47, -36] -> T: left = -47+6*(T-2), right = -36+6*(T-2)\n   Car2: (12,1,right,6) -> initial span: [1,12] -> T: left = 1+6*(T-2), right = 12+6*(T-2)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, we start at T=2, y=2 (freeway 2). We are safe at T=2 as computed.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves if no cars is 7 moves (each up). But we have to check the intermediate rows.\n\nLet me try to simulate going up as fast as possible:\n\nPlan: at each turn, go up until we hit 9.\n\nBut we must check each freeway we step on at the turn we are on it.\n\nStart:\n  T=2: at y=2 -> safe.\n\n  Action at T=2: U -> then at T=3, we will be at y=3.\n\n  But note: at T=2 we are at y=2. Then we take action U at T=2, so we move at the end of T=2 to y=3? Actually, the update is: at turn t, we take action a_t, then we update to y_{t+1}. So at turn t, we are at y_t and we take action a_t, then at the next turn we are at y_{t+1}=y_t+Δy.\n\n  Therefore, at turn T, we are at y_T. And we are on freeway y_T (if between 1 and 8) at that turn T.\n\n  So at T=2: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n\n  Then we choose a_2=U -> so at T=3, we are at y=3.\n\n  At T=3: we are on freeway3. Check freeway3 at T=3.\n\n  Freeway3: one car: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at T=3: \n        left = -59 + 12*(3-2) = -59 + 12 = -47\n        right = -48 + 12 = -36\n        So the car spans from -47 to -36. Does 0 lie in [-47,-36]? -47<=0<=-36? 0 is greater than -36? No, because -36<0? Actually, -36 is less than 0, so 0 is to the right of -36 -> not in the interval. So safe.\n\n  Then we choose a_3=U -> at T=4, y=4.\n\n  T=4: freeway4. Car: same as freeway3? \n        left = -59 + 12*(4-2) = -59+24 = -35\n        right = -48+24 = -24\n        Interval [-35,-24] -> 0 not in it? because -35<=0<=-24 -> no, because 0 is greater than -24? So safe.\n\n  T=4: action U -> T=5, y=5.\n\n  T=5: freeway5. Car: same as above.\n        left = -59 + 12*(5-2)= -59+36=-23\n        right = -48+36=-12\n        Interval [-23,-12] -> 0 not in it? (since -12<0) -> safe.\n\n  Then a_5=U -> T=6, y=6.\n\n  T=6: freeway6. There are two cars.\n\n        Car1: same as above? \n             left = -59 + 12*(6-2)= -59+48=-11\n             right = -48+48=0\n        So the first car at T=6: [-11,0]. Does 0 lie in it? Yes, because right_end=0. So 0 is included? The problem says \"0 in the span\" -> so if the car ends at 0, then yes, collision.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be on freeway6 at T=6.\n\n  So if we go up at T=5 to y=6 at T=6, we collide.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot take the U action at T=5 (which would lead to T=6 at y=6).\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nWe must avoid being at y=6 at T=6.\n\nOptions at T=5 (when we are at y=5):\n  We can choose to not go up: we can stay (S) or go down (D). But going down would be away from goal.\n\n  Alternatively, we might wait at y=5 for one turn? Then at T=6 we are still at y=5? Then at T=7 we can go to y=6? But we have to check if at T=7, freeway6 is safe.\n\n  Let me compute freeway6 at T=7 for both cars.\n\n  Car1: at T=7: left = -59 + 12*(7-2)= -59+60=1, right= -48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in it? safe.\n\n  Car2: at T=7: \n        initial: [13,24] at T=2 -> at T=7: left=13+12*5=13+60=73, right=24+60=84 -> [73,84] -> 0 not in it.\n\n  So at T=7, freeway6 is safe.\n\n  But then we would be at y=5 at T=6? Then we can go to y=6 at T=7.\n\n  However, we must also check the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\n  At T=5: we are at y=5 -> freeway5: \n        T=5: car on freeway5: left=-59+12*(5-2)= -59+36=-23, right=-48+36=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  Then at T=5, we choose S (stay) -> then at T=6, we are still at y=5? But we are on freeway5 at T=6? \n\n  Freeway5 at T=6: \n        left = -59 + 12*(6-2)= -59+48=-11\n        right = -48+48=0\n        So the car is [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision at T=6 if we are on freeway5 at T=6.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot stay at y=5 at T=5 because then at T=6 we are at y=5 and collide.\n\n  Alternatively, we can go down to y=4 at T=6? But that moves away.\n\n  Or we can go up at T=5 to y=6? But we saw that at T=6, y=6 is not safe.\n\n  So we must leave freeway5 at T=6? \n\n  The only moves from y=5: \n      U -> y=6 (at T=6) -> collide (as above)\n      S -> y=5 (at T=6) -> collide (as above)\n      D -> y=4 (at T=6) -> then we are on freeway4 at T=6.\n\n  Check freeway4 at T=6: \n        Car: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at T=6: left=-59+12*4=-59+48=-11, right=-48+48=0 -> same as freeway5? So [ -11,0] -> 0 is included -> collide.\n\n  Therefore, at T=6, freeway4,5,6 are all unsafe? \n\n  Let me check:\n\n  Freeway4 at T=6: same car as freeway5? \n        left = -59 + 12*(6-2) = -59+48=-11\n        right = -48+48=0 -> [ -11,0] -> 0 is in it -> unsafe.\n\n  Freeway5: same -> unsafe.\n\n  Freeway6: as above, car1: [-11,0] and car2: [13+12*4=13+48=61, 24+48=72] -> so the first car is [-11,0] -> 0 in it -> unsafe.\n\n  What about freeway3 at T=6?\n        Freeway3: same car -> T=6: left=-59+48=-11, right=0 -> unsafe.\n\n  Freeway2 at T=6: \n        left=-59+12*4=-59+48=-11, right=-48+48=0 -> unsafe.\n\n  Freeway1 at T=6: \n        Car: (-42,-53,right,3) -> at T=6: \n            left = -53 + 3*(6-2)= -53+12=-41\n            right = -42+12=-30\n        Interval: [-41,-30] -> 0 not in it -> safe.\n\n  Freeway7 at T=6:\n        Car1: [-47, -36] -> at T=6: left=-47+6*(6-2)= -47+24=-23, right=-36+24=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n        Car2: [1,12] -> at T=6: left=1+24=25, right=12+24=36 -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\n  Freeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\n  So at T=6, the safe freeways are only 1,7,8? And row0 and row9? But we are at y=5 at T=5. We can only move to adjacent rows: so from y=5 at T=5, we can go to y=4,5,6. But all of these are unsafe at T=6? \n\n  Then we must avoid being on freeways 2,3,4,5,6 at T=6.\n\n  Therefore, at T=5 we cannot choose any action that leaves us on any freeway from 2 to 6 at T=6? \n\n  But we are at y=5 at T=5. We can only move to y=4,5,6. So we are stuck? \n\n  Alternatively, we must consider that at T=5 we are at y=5, and we can only move to adjacent rows. But if we move to y=4,5, or 6, we are on freeway 4,5, or 6 at T=6, which are all unsafe.\n\n  Then we must have avoided being at y=5 at T=5? \n\n  Let me check: how did we get to y=5 at T=5? \n\n  We started at T=2: y=2 -> safe.\n  T=2: U -> T=3: y=3 -> safe.\n  T=3: U -> T=4: y=4 -> safe.\n  T=4: U -> T=5: y=5 -> safe? Yes, because at T=5: freeway5: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  But then at T=5 we are forced to make a move that leads to T=6 on freeway 4,5,6 -> unsafe.\n\n  So we need to adjust earlier.\n\n  Maybe at T=4 we don't go up? \n\n  At T=4: we are at y=4. We have options: U, D, S.\n\n  If we go up: then at T=5 we are at y=5 -> then we are stuck at T=6.\n\n  If we stay at T=4: then at T=5 we are at y=4. Then at T=5 we are on freeway4.\n\n        Freeway4 at T=5: \n             left = -59 + 12*(5-2)= -59+36=-23, right=-48+36=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n        Then at T=5 we are at y=4. Then we must choose an action for T=5: \n            U: to y=5 -> then at T=6 we are at y=5 -> unsafe (as above, freeway5 at T=6: [-11,0] -> unsafe)\n            S: stay at y=4 -> at T=6: freeway4 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe\n            D: to y=3 -> at T=6: freeway3 -> same car: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        So again, stuck.\n\n  If at T=4 we go down to y=3: \n        Then at T=5 we are at y=3. Then at T=5: freeway3 -> \n             left = -59+12*3 = -59+36=-23, right=-48+36=-12 -> safe.\n\n        Then at T=5 we are at y=3. Then we can choose:\n            U: to y=4 at T=6 -> freeway4 at T=6: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n            S: y=3 at T=6 -> freeway3: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n            D: to y=2 at T=6 -> freeway2: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        Again, unsafe.\n\n  So we must avoid being on any freeway from 2 to 6 at T=6? \n\n  But then how do we get to the goal? We have to skip T=6 on these freeways? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try to be at row0 or row9 at T=6? \n\n  At T=5, we are at y=4. If we go down twice? But we are at T=4: y=4. Then at T=4: we go down to y=3 -> then at T=5: y=3 -> then at T=5 we go down to y=2 -> then at T=6: y=2 -> but freeway2 at T=6: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n  Or at T=5 we go down to y=1? From y=3 at T=5: we can go down to y=2 and then to y=1? But that's two moves? We are at T=5: y=3. Then if we go down at T=5: to y=2 -> then at T=6 we are at y=2 -> unsafe.\n\n  How about going to row0? \n        From y=3 at T=5: we can go down three times? But we can only move one per turn.\n\n        At T=5: we are at y=3. We can go down to y=2 at T=6 -> then at T=6: y=2 -> unsafe (freeway2: [-11,0]).\n        Then at T=6 we could go down to y=1 at T=7? But at T=6 we are at y=2 -> then action at T=6: D -> to y=1 at T=7.\n\n        At T=7: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at T=7: \n             left = -53 + 3*(7-2) = -53+15 = -38\n             right = -42+15 = -27\n             [-38,-27] -> safe.\n\n        Then we can start going up again.\n\n  But let's see the entire path:\n\n  T=2: y=2 -> safe.\n  T=2: action? We want to avoid being in the middle at T=6. \n\n  We have to slow down earlier.\n\n  Alternatively, at T=2 we don't go up immediately? \n\n  Let me try a different strategy: wait at the bottom until the dangerous time passes.\n\n  The dangerous freeways (2-6) are unsafe at T=6. But they are safe at T=7? \n\n  Check freeway2 at T=7: \n        left = -59+12*(7-2)= -59+60=1, right=-48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in it -> safe.\n  Similarly, freeway3,4,5: same car, so at T=7: [1,12] -> safe.\n  Freeway6: \n        Car1: [-59+12*5=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n        Car2: [13+60=73,24+60=84] -> safe.\n\n  So at T=7, freeways 2-6 are safe again.\n\n  Therefore, we can plan to be at a safe row at T=6 (like row0,1,7,8,9) and then proceed.\n\n  How about:\n\n  We start at T=2, y=2. Instead of going up, we go down to row1 or row0? \n\n  But we want to minimize time, so we don't want to go down unnecessarily.\n\n  We can try to be at row0 at T=6? \n\n  Let me compute a path that avoids freeways 2-6 at T=6.\n\n  We have from T=2 to T=6: 4 moves.\n\n  We start at y=2.\n\n  We need to get to a safe row at T=6. Safe rows at T=6: \n        row0: no freeway -> safe.\n        row1: freeway1 -> at T=6: we computed: [-41,-30] -> safe.\n        row7: freeway7 -> at T=6: car1: [-23,-12], car2: [25,36] -> safe.\n        row8: same as row7 -> safe.\n        row9: safe.\n\n  But row9 is the goal, so we don't need to leave it.\n\n  How to get to row1 by T=6? \n\n  From y=2 at T=2, we can go down to y=1 at T=3, then stay there until T=6? \n\n  But at T=3,4,5,6 we are at y=1? \n\n  Check freeway1 at each turn:\n\n        T=3: freeway1: \n            left = -53+3*(3-2)= -53+3=-50\n            right = -42+3=-39 -> [-50,-39] -> safe.\n\n        T=4: left=-53+3*2=-53+6=-47, right=-42+6=-36 -> safe.\n\n        T=5: left=-53+9=-44, right=-42+9=-33 -> safe.\n\n        T=6: left=-53+12=-41, right=-42+12=-30 -> safe.\n\n  So we can be at y=1 from T=3 to T=6 safely.\n\n  Then at T=6, we are at y=1. Then we can start moving up.\n\n  But we want to minimize time. How many moves from y=1 to y=9? 8 moves. But we already used 4 moves to get to T=6 at y=1 (from T=2 to T=6: 4 turns? Actually, from T=2 to T=3: one action, T=3 to T=4: second, T=4 to T=5: third, T=5 to T=6: fourth -> so 4 actions and we are at y=1 at T=6).\n\n  Then from T=6 to T=14: 8 moves up to get to y=9? That would be 4+8=12 actions? But we could have done it in 7 if not for the obstacle.\n\n  Alternatively, we can go up faster after T=6.\n\n  At T=6: y=1. Then we can go up:\n\n        T=6: action U -> T=7: y=2.\n        T=7: freeway2: at T=7: [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\n        T=7: U -> T=8: y=3 -> freeway3: same car as freeway2 at T=7: [1,12] -> safe.\n        T=8: U -> T=9: y=4 -> freeway4: [1,12] -> safe.\n        T=9: U -> T=10: y=5 -> freeway5: [1,12] -> safe.\n        T=10: U -> T=11: y=6 -> freeway6: \n             Car1: [1,12] at T=10? Wait, we need at T=11 for freeway6.\n\n        Actually, we are at turn T when we are on the freeway.\n\n        At T=11: \n             freeway6 car1: at T=11: \n                 left = -59 + 12*(11-2)= -59+12*9=-59+108=49, right=-48+108=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n             car2: [13+12*9=13+108=121,24+108=132] -> safe.\n\n        Then T=11: U -> T=12: y=7 -> freeway7: \n             car1: [-47+6*(12-2)= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> [13,24] -> safe (0 not in)\n             car2: [1+6*10=1+60=61,12+60=72] -> safe.\n\n        T=12: U -> T=13: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7? \n             car1: [13,24] -> safe.\n             car2: [61,72] -> safe.\n\n        T=13: U -> T=14: y=9 -> goal.\n\n        So total turns: from T=2 to T=14: that is 13 turns? But we are counting the actions: from T=2 to T=14, we have 12 actions? \n\n        The sequence: \n          T=2: action1\n          ...\n          T=13: action12 -> then at T=14, we are at y=9.\n\n        So H=12.\n\n        But we started at T=2, and we have actions at turns: 2,3,4,...,13 (12 actions) and then at turn 14 we are at y=9.\n\n        But the goal is to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = 14 -> so H-1=12 -> H=13? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n          We take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          After H actions, we are at turn t1+H-1 and we must be at y=9.\n\n          So if we take 12 actions: turns 2,3,...,13. Then at turn 13+1? Wait, after the last action (at turn 13) we are at the next turn? \n\n          Actually, the update: at turn t, we take action a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} which is the state at the next turn.\n\n          Therefore, after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we have the state at turn t1+H.\n\n          We require that at turn t1+H, we are at y=9? But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\n          Let me reread: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and \"after H actions\".\n\n          And: \"the position after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) should be 9\".\n\n          Actually, the player update: \n            y_{t_1} is given at turn t_1.\n            Then we take a_{t_1} -> then y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n            Then at turn t_1+1, we are at y_{t_1+1}.\n\n          Therefore, after the first action (at t_1) we are at turn t_1+1.\n\n          After H actions, we are at turn t_1+H.\n\n          And we require that y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\n          But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"? \n\n          Let me check: \n            \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then: \"minimizes H such that y_{t_1+H-1}=9\"\n\n          Wait, the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\" -> so after H-1 actions? \n\n          Actually, the indexing: \n            t=0: a_{t_1+0} = a_{t_1} -> then we get y_{t_1+1}\n            t=1: a_{t_1+1} -> then we get y_{t_1+2}\n            ...\n            t=H-1: a_{t_1+H-1} -> then we get y_{t_1+H}\n\n          But the problem says: \"after the sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\", and the last action is at t_1+H-1, and then the next state is at t_1+H. \n\n          However, the problem states: \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\" ? \n\n          Let me read carefully: \n            \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then in the answer format: \n            Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n            Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n            ...\n            Turn t_1+H-1: a_{t_1+H-1}\n\n          And we require that at turn t_1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? \n\n          But the update: the action at turn t_1+H-1 would update the position to y_{t_1+H}. \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Looking back at the update rule: \n            \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\n          So at turn t, we are at y_t, then we take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\n          Therefore, to be at y=9 at a particular turn, say turn T, we must have taken the last action at turn T-1.\n\n          The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"? \n\n          Actually, the problem states: \"such that y_{t_1+H-1}=9\". \n\n          That would mean that at turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\n          How is that achieved? \n\n          We start at turn t_1 at y_{t_1}. Then we take an action at turn t_1, which updates to y_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1.\n\n          To be at y=9 at turn t_1+H-1, we must have taken H-1 actions? \n\n          But the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: that is H actions? \n\n          This is inconsistent.\n\n          Let me re-read: \n            \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n          The index t from 0 to H-1: so that's H actions: at turns t_1+0, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\n          Then the position after these actions? \n\n          After the action at turn t_1+H-1, we get the next state at turn t_1+H.\n\n          But the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\"\n\n          That would be the state at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action? \n\n          The update rule is: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we take action a_t, then we get y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\n          Therefore, at turn t_1, we are given y_{t_1}. \n          Then we take a_{t_1} and then we are at turn t_1+1 with y_{t_1+1}.\n          ...\n          After taking a_{t_1+H-1} at turn t_1+H-1, we then are at turn t_1+H with y_{t_1+H}.\n\n          The problem requires that at turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9? But that would be the state at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, before taking the action.\n\n          But we start at turn t_1 at y_{t_1}=2, and then we take actions. We are not at 9 at turn t_1.\n\n          The requirement is: \"such that y_{t_1+H-1}=9\"\n\n          This must be a typo. Because if we are at y=9 at turn t_1+H-1, then we haven't taken the action at turn t_1+H-1 yet. But the sequence includes an action at turn t_1+H-1.\n\n          Alternatively, the problem might mean that after the action at turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9 at turn t_1+H.\n\n          But then the state at turn t_1+H-1 is not 9.\n\n          Given the confusion, let me look at the example: minimal steps to go from 2 to 9: if no cars, we would do 7 actions: \n             a_2=U, a_3=U, ..., a_8=U -> then at turn 9 we are at y=9.\n\n          So H=7, and we have actions from t=2 to t=8 (7 actions), and at turn 9 we are at y=9.\n\n          But the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\" -> in this case t_1=2, H=7, so y_{2+7-1}=y_8=9. \n\n          That matches: after the last action (at turn 8) we are at y_8=9? \n\n          But according to the update: \n               turn 2: a2=U -> y3=3\n               turn 3: a3=U -> y4=4\n               ...\n               turn 8: a8=U -> y9=9.\n\n          So at turn 9, we are at y9=9, not at turn 8.\n\n          However, the problem requires y_{t_1+H-1}=y_{8}=9.\n\n          This is inconsistent.\n\n          I think there is a off-by-one error in the problem statement.\n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n            \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n            and then \"such that y_{t_1+H-1}=9\"\n\n          But in the update, the state at turn t_1+H-1 is determined by the action at turn t_1+H-2.\n\n          To have y_{t_1+H-1}=9, we would have taken H-1 actions: from turn t_1 to t_1+H-2.\n\n          But the sequence has H actions.\n\n          This suggests that the last action is taken at turn t_1+H-1, but then the state at turn t_1+H-1 is not 9 (it would be at turn t_1+H).\n\n          Given the confusion, I will assume that the intended meaning is that after the last action (at turn t_1+H-1) we are at y=9 at turn t_1+H. However, the problem explicitly says \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\".\n\n          Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that we are at y=9 at the turn when we take the last action? But that doesn't make sense because the action changes it.\n\n          I think the problem has a typo. In many such problems, the state after the action is at the next turn. And we want to be at the goal state after the last action, i.e., at turn t_1+H.\n\n          But the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\"\n\n          Let me check the car collision rule: it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if ...\", and we are at turn T at position (0, y_T). So if we are at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\n          Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn T, we need y_T=9.\n\n          The problem requires that at turn t_1+H-1, we are at (0,9), so y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\n          How to achieve that?\n\n          We start at turn t_1 at y_{t_1}=2.\n\n          We take an action at turn t_1: then at turn t_1+1 we are at y_{t_1+1}.\n\n          To be at y_{t_1+H-1}=9, we must have taken H-1 actions: because the actions are taken at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-2, and then at turn t_1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n          Therefore, the sequence of actions has length H-1? But the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\n          This is inconsistent.\n\n          Given the time, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \n             We take H actions: at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n             Then the state at turn t_1+H is 9.\n\n          And the requirement is to have y_{t_1+H}=9.\n\n          Because otherwise, the number of actions H and the turn number don't match.\n\n          In the example of 7 actions to go from 2 to 9, we would have turn t_1+7 = 2+7=9 -> y_9=9.\n\n          So I think the problem meant: such that y_{t_1+H}=9.\n\n          And the answer format has H actions.\n\n          So I'll proceed under this assumption.\n\n          Therefore, we need to reach y=9 at turn t_1+H = 2+H.\n\n          In our earlier plan with 12 actions, we reach at turn 2+12=14: y_14=9.\n\n          But is there a faster way?\n\n          We want to minimize H.\n\n          The fastest is 7 actions, but we saw that at T=6 (which is turn 2+4=6) we would be at y=6 and collide.\n\n          So we have to delay.\n\n          How about we wait at a safe place at T=6 and then go up.\n\n          We can try to be at y=0 or y=1 or y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at T=6.\n\n          We start at y=2 at T=2.\n\n          To be at y=1 at T=6, we need to move down once and then stay, but let's compute the moves:\n\n          Actions from T=2 to T=5 (4 actions) to reach y=1 at T=6.\n\n          T=2: action D: then at T=3: y=1.\n          Then T=3: action S: T=4: y=1.\n          T=4: S: T=5: y=1.\n          T=5: S: T=6: y=1.  -> safe as we saw.\n\n          Then from T=6: we can start going up.\n\n          We need to go from y=1 to y=9: 8 steps.\n\n          So actions from T=6 to T=13: 8 actions: U eight times.\n\n          Check safety:\n\n          T=6: y=1: safe.\n          T=6: action U -> T=7: y=2.\n             freeway2 at T=7: [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=7: U -> T=8: y=3: freeway3: [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=8: U -> T=9: y=4: freeway4: [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=9: U -> T=10: y=5: freeway5: [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=10: U -> T=11: y=6: freeway6: \n               car1: [-59+12*(11-2)= -59+108=49, -48+108=60] -> [49,60] -> safe.\n               car2: [13+108=121,24+108=132] -> safe.\n          T=11: U -> T=12: y=7: freeway7: \n               car1: [-47+6*(12-2)= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> [13,24] -> safe.\n               car2: [1+60=61,12+60=72] -> safe.\n          T=12: U -> T=13: y=8: freeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n          T=13: U -> T=14: y=9: goal.\n\n          Total actions: from T=2 to T=13: 12 actions.\n\n          H=12.\n\n          But can we do better? \n\n          Instead of waiting at y=1 for three turns (T=3,4,5), can we wait at a higher row? \n\n          For example, at T=6, be at y=7 or y=8, which are safe, and then only need 2 or 1 steps to goal.\n\n          How to get to y=7 at T=6? \n\n          We start at y=2 at T=2. We need to go up 5 steps in 4 actions? 5>4 -> impossible.\n\n          Similarly, y=8: 6 steps in 4 actions -> impossible.\n\n          y=0: to get to y=0 at T=6: \n             from y=2, we need to move down twice. \n             T=2: D -> T=3: y=1\n             T=3: D -> T=4: y=0\n             Then we can stay at y=0 for T=5 and T=6: actions S,S.\n             So at T=6: y=0 -> safe.\n\n          Then from T=6: \n             actions: \n                T=6: U -> T=7: y=1 -> freeway1: at T=7: as above, [-38,-27] -> safe.\n                T=7: U -> T=8: y=2 -> freeway2: [1,12] -> safe.\n                T=8: U -> T=9: y=3 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n                T=9: U -> T=10: y=4 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n                T=10: U -> T=11: y=5 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n                T=11: U -> T=12: y=6 -> [49,60] and [121,132] -> safe.\n                T=12: U -> T=13: y=7 -> [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe.\n                T=13: U -> T=14: y=8 -> safe.\n                T=14: U -> T=15: y=9 -> goal.\n\n          This takes 9 actions from T=6 onwards, plus the 4 actions from T=2 to T=5 -> total 13 actions. -> worse than the previous.\n\n          How about be at y=7 at T=6? -> not possible.\n\n          Or y=8 at T=6? not possible.\n\n          What if we be at y=1 for only one turn and then move to a safe freeway earlier? \n\n          But the only safe freeways at T=6 are 1,7,8.\n\n          We can try to go to freeway7 at T=6: y=7 at T=6.\n\n          How to get from y=2 at T=2 to y=7 at T=6: requires 5 steps up in 4 actions: not possible.\n\n          Alternatively, can we avoid the collision by not being on freeway6 at T=6 and also not on the lower ones, but without waiting too long? \n\n          For example, at T=2: U to y=3.\n          T=3: U to y=4.\n          T=4: U to y=5.\n          T=5: we cannot stay at y=5, and we cannot go to y=6 because at T=6 they are unsafe, and we cannot go to y=4 because also unsafe.\n\n          But what if at T=5 we go to y=7? But we can only move to adjacent: from y=5, we can only go to y=4,5,6. We cannot jump to y=7.\n\n          So we must pass through y=6 to get to y=7.\n\n          Therefore, we have to be at y=6 at some turn. But at T=6, y=6 is unsafe. \n\n          But at T=7, y=6 is safe. \n\n          So we can be at y=6 at T=7.\n\n          How to arrange that? \n\n          We want to be at y=6 at T=7.\n\n          We are at T=2: y=2.\n          T=2: U -> T=3: y=3.\n          T=3: U -> T=4: y=4.\n          T=4: we have to kill two turns before T=7? \n                Actions from T=4 to T=6: three actions.\n\n          We need to go from y=4 at T=4 to y=6 at T=7.\n\n          This requires two steps up in three actions: so we can do U, U, and one extra action. We can do an extra move: for example, go up then down then up, but that might be messy.\n\n          Specifically:\n\n          T=4: at y=4.\n          Possibilities:\n\n          Option1:\n             T=4: U -> y=5 at T=5.\n             T=5: we cannot stay or move to y=6 at T=6 because unsafe, and we cannot move to y=4 because unsafe at T=6? \n                   But note: at T=5 we are at y=5, and we are on freeway5 at T=5: \n                         freeway5 at T=5: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n             Then at T=5, we can do what? \n                   U: y=6 at T=6 -> unsafe.\n                   S: y=5 at T=6 -> unsafe.\n                   D: y=4 at T=6 -> freeway4 at T=6: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot do that.\n\n          Option2: at T=4: we don't go up. \n             T=4: S -> then at T=5: y=4.\n                    freeway4 at T=5: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n             Then at T=5: we can try to move to a safe haven? But the only safe haven at T=6 is y=1,7,8.\n             From y=4, we can only move to y=3,4,5 -> none of which are safe at T=6.\n\n          Option3: T=4: D -> to y=3 at T=5.\n                    freeway3 at T=5: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n             Then at T=5: we can try to move to y=2,3, or4. \n                   But at T=6, these are unsafe.\n\n          Therefore, it seems we cannot avoid the waiting at a safe row for T=6.\n\n          The best is to wait at y=1 for three turns.\n\n          Total actions: 12.\n\n          But is there a way to wait only two turns? \n\n          We can try to be at y=1 at T=6, but not spend extra turns in between.\n\n          We start at y=2 at T=2.\n          We can do:\n             T=2: D -> T=3: y=1.\n             Then we have turns T=3,4,5 to kill, but we want to minimize. \n             We can then at T=3: S, T=4: S, T=5: S, and T=6: y=1.\n          That's three actions of S.\n\n          Alternatively, we could move to y=0 and then back, but that would be more actions.\n\n          So the total actions are: \n             T=2: D\n             T=3: S\n             T=4: S\n             T=5: S\n             T=6: U\n             T=7: U\n             T=8: U\n             T=9: U\n             T=10: U\n             T=11: U\n             T=12: U\n             T=13: U  -> 12 actions.\n\n          But note: after 12 actions, we are at turn 2+12=14, and y=9.\n\n          However, we can try to use the freeway7 or 8 earlier? \n\n          Another idea: after T=6, when the lower freeways are safe, we can move up quickly. \n          But we have to go through freeway6 at some point, and it is safe after T=7.\n\n          How about we are at a higher safe haven at T=6, like y=7 or 8.\n\n          We cannot reach y=7 or 8 in 4 actions from y=2.\n\n          Unless we move up faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\n          Therefore, 12 actions is the best we have.\n\n          But let me confirm if we can do it in 11 actions.\n\n          Suppose we are at y=2 at T=2.\n          We want to be at a safe place at T=6. The closest safe haven upward is y=7 or 8, which is 5 or 6 steps up. We have 4 actions to spend (from T=2 to T=5 inclusive), so we can only gain 4 steps. We start at 2, so at best we can be at y=6 at T=6, but that is unsafe.\n\n          The only safe haven within 4 steps from y=2 is y=1 (down) and y=0.\n\n          So we must go down to y=1.\n\n          Then from y=1 to y=9: 8 steps, which takes 8 actions.\n\n          Plus the down action and the three stays, that is 1+3+8 = 12.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 12.\n\n          Now, write the actions:\n\n          Turn 2: D  (from y=2 to y=1)\n          Turn 3: S  (y=1 -> y=1)\n          Turn 4: S  (y=1)\n          Turn 5: S  (y=1)\n          Turn 6: U  (y=1->y=2)\n          Turn 7: U  (y=2->y=3)\n          Turn 8: U  (y=3->y=4)\n          Turn 9: U  (y=4->y=5)\n          Turn 10: U (y=5->y=6)\n          Turn 11: U (y=6->y=7)\n          Turn 12: U (y=7->y=8)\n          Turn 13: U (y=8->y=9)\n\n          But we have to check safety at each freeway we are on:\n\n          T=2: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (already checked)\n          T=3: y=1 -> freeway1: [-50,-39] -> safe.\n          T=4: y=1 -> freeway1: [-47,-36] -> safe.\n          T=5: y=1 -> freeway1: [-44,-33] -> safe.\n          T=6: y=1 -> freeway1: [-41,-30] -> safe.\n          T=7: y=2 -> freeway2: [1,12] (because T=7: -59+12*5=-59+60=1, -48+60=12) -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=8: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2 at T=7: [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=9: y=4 -> freeway4: [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=10: y=5 -> freeway5: [1,12] -> safe.\n          T=11: y=6 -> freeway6: \n                car1: at T=11: left=-59+12*(11-2)= -59+108=49, right= -48+108=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n                car2: [13+12*9=121, 24+108=132] -> safe.\n          T=12: y=7 -> freeway7: \n                car1: [-47+6*(12-2)= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> [13,24] -> safe.\n                car2: [1+6*10=61, 12+60=72] -> safe.\n          T=13: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\n          Then after the action at T=13, we are at y=9 at T=14.\n\n          But the problem might require that at turn t_1+H-1=2+12-1=13, we are at y=9. \n          However, in our simulation, at turn 13 we are at y=8, and then after the action U at turn 13, we are at y=9 at turn 14.\n\n          But the problem might have intended that we are at y=9 at the turn when we take the last action.\n\n          Given the confusion, and since the problem says \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\", we need to be at y=9 at turn 13.\n\n          How to achieve that? \n\n          We would need to be at y=9 at turn 13.\n\n          We start at turn2: y=2.\n\n          We have 11 actions (H=11) to get to y=9 at turn 2+11-1=12? \n\n          Let me compute: \n             actions: turns 2,3,...,12 (11 actions), then at turn 13 we are at y=9? \n\n          But the requirement is y_{t_1+H-1}=y_{2+11-1}=y_{12}=9.\n\n          So at turn12, we are at y=9.\n\n          How to achieve that? \n\n          We need to go from y=2 to y=9 in 10 steps? Because the actions from turn2 to turn11 (10 actions) update the state from turn3 to turn12.\n\n          Specifically:\n\n          We are at turn2: y2=2.\n          a2: -> y3\n          a3: -> y4\n          ...\n          a11: -> y12\n\n          We require y12=9.\n\n          So we need to cover 7 steps in 10 actions? That means we can use 7 U and 3 S or 7 U and 3 D? But D would be away.\n\n          We have to avoid the cars.\n\n          We know that at T=6, freeways 2-6 are unsafe.\n\n          We need to be at a safe row at T=6.\n\n          The only safe rows at T=6 are 0,1,7,8,9.\n\n          We start at y=2 at T=2.\n\n          To be at y=7 at T=6: requires 5 steps up in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n          To be at y=1 at T=6: requires 1 step down in 4 actions: easy, and then we have to go up.\n\n          Specifically:\n\n          T=2: D -> y3=1\n          T=3: S -> y4=1\n          T=4: S -> y5=1\n          T=5: S -> y6=1   (safe)\n\n          Then from T=6 to T=12: 6 actions to go from y=1 to y=9: requires 8 steps up, but 6 actions only allow 6 steps. -> we can only get to y=1+6=7 at T=12.\n\n          Not enough.\n\n          To be at y=0 at T=6: \n             T=2: D -> y3=1\n             T=3: D -> y4=0\n             T=4: S -> y5=0\n             T=5: S -> y6=0  (safe)\n\n          Then from T=6: actions: 6 actions to go from 0 to 9: requires 9 steps, impossible.\n\n          To be at y=8 at T=6: impossible.\n\n          To be at y=9 at T=6: then we are done, but from y=2 to y=9 in 4 actions: requires 7 steps -> impossible.\n\n          Therefore, it is impossible to be at y=9 at turn12 (which is T=12) with only 11 actions (H=11).\n\n          We need at least 12 actions to reach y=9 at turn14.\n\n          But the problem might require y_{t_1+H-1}=9, which would be turn13 for H=12: y13=9.\n\n          In our plan, at turn13 we are at y=8, and then after the action at turn13 we are at y=9 at turn14.\n\n          So to have y13=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn13.\n\n          How? \n\n          We are at turn2: y2=2.\n          Actions: a2 to a11 (10 actions) to have turn12: y12.\n          Then a12: action at turn12 -> then y13 = y12 + action.\n\n          We require y13=9.\n\n          So we need to be at y=8 or y=9 or y=10 at turn12. But y=10 is invalid.\n\n          If we are at y=8 at turn12, then a12=U -> y13=9.\n\n          If we are at y=9 at turn12, then a12=S -> y13=9.\n\n          So we need to be at y=8 or y=9 at turn12.\n\n          The number of steps from y=2 to y=8 or 9: at least 6 or 7 steps.\n\n          We have 10 actions (from turn2 to turn11) to determine y12.\n\n          So we can do 6 or 7 steps in 10 actions.\n\n          We have to avoid the cars, especially at T=6.\n\n          We still need to be at a safe haven at T=6.\n\n          Safe havens: 0,1,7,8,9.\n\n          We want to minimize actions, so we try to be at a high safe haven at T=6.\n\n          The highest we can be at T=6 is y=6, but it's unsafe. Next is y=7: requires 5 steps from y=2 in 4 actions: impossible.\n\n          So the highest safe haven we can be at T=6 is y=1 or 0.\n\n          Then from there, we have 6 actions (from turn6 to turn11) to get to y=8 or 9 at turn12.\n\n          From y=1 at T=6 to y=8 at turn12: requires 7 steps in 6 actions: possible if we do 6 ups and one extra action? \n\n          Specifically, from T=6 to T=11: 5 actions for the state from T=7 to T=12.\n\n          We are at T=6: y=1.\n          We need to be at y=8 at T=12.\n\n          So we need to cover 7 steps in 5 actions: impossible.\n\n          From y=0 at T=6: to y=8 at T=12: 8 steps in 5 actions: impossible.\n\n          Therefore, it is not possible to have y13=9 with H=12 actions.\n\n          This is very confusing.\n\n          Given the time, I will output the 12-action plan that gets to y=9 at turn14.\n\n          And in the answer, we list 12 actions.\n\n          The problem might accept that.\n\n          So the answer is:\n\n          Turn 2: D\n          Turn 3: S\n          Turn 4: S\n          Turn 5: S\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: U\n\n          But wait, we have 12 actions: turns 2 to 13.\n\n          Then at turn14, we are at y=9.\n\n          If the problem insists on being at y=9 at turn13, then we would need an alternative.\n\n          How about we are at y=8 at turn12, then at turn12 we do U, and then at turn13 we are at y=9.\n\n          To be at y=8 at turn12.\n\n          We have 10 actions from turn2 to turn11 to go from y=2 at turn2 to y=8 at turn12.\n\n          The steps: 6 steps up.\n\n          We have 10 actions, so we can do 6 U and 4 S (or other moves).\n\n          We need to avoid the cars, especially at T=6.\n\n          We need to be at a safe haven at T=6.\n\n          Safe havens: 0,1,7,8,9.\n\n          From y=2, can we be at y=7 at T=6? -> 5 steps in 4 actions: not possible.\n\n          y=8: not possible.\n\n          So only y=0 or y=1.\n\n          Then from y=1 at T=6, we need to go to y=8 at turn12.\n\n          The difference: 7 steps in 6 actions (actions at turns 6,7,8,9,10,11) -> then the state at turn12 is y=1+7=8.\n\n          How? \n\n          Actions from turn6 to turn11: 6 actions.\n\n          We need to move up 7 steps? -> not possible, maximum is 6 steps.\n\n          So we can only get to y=1+6=7 at turn12.\n\n          Then at turn12, we are at y=7. Then we can do U at turn12 to get to y=8 at turn13.\n\n          But we need to be at y=8 at turn12 for our purpose? \n\n          We want y12=8.\n\n          If we are at y=7 at turn12, then we are not at 8.\n\n          So we need to be at y=8 at turn12.\n\n          Therefore, the only hope is to be at a safe haven at T=6 that is high enough so that we can cover the steps.\n\n          Since we cannot be at y=7 or 8 at T=6, we must find a path that goes through freeway7 or 8 at T=6, but we can only be there if we move up fast enough.\n\n          It is impossible.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 12 for reaching at turn14.\n\n          Given the problem's off-by-one, we output the 12 actions.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\", which for H=12 would be turn2+11=13.\n\n          So we need to be at y=9 at turn13.\n\n          In our simulation, at turn13 we are at y=8.\n\n          How about we remove one of the stay actions and go up faster? \n\n          We were at y=1 from T=3 to T=6. But we can leave earlier if we can.\n\n          For example, we do:\n\n          T=2: D -> y3=1.\n          T=3: S -> y4=1.\n          T=4: U -> y5=2.   -> at T=5: y=2. Check freeway2 at T=5: \n                left = -59+12*(5-2)= -59+36=-23, right=-48+36=-12 -> safe.\n          T=5: we are at y=2. We have to be careful because at T=6, freeway2 is unsafe. So we cannot be at y=2 at T=6.\n\n          So at T=5: we must move away from freeways 2-6.\n\n          We can only move to y=1,2,3.\n\n          None of these are safe at T=6.\n\n          So we cannot leave y=1 until after T=6.\n\n          Therefore, we must be at a safe haven at T=6, and y=1 is the only one we can reach.\n\n          So we have to be at y=1 from T=3 to T=6.\n\n          Then after T=6, we go up as fast as possible.\n\n          To be at y=9 at turn13, we need to be at y=8 at turn12 (because then a12=U -> y13=9).\n\n          We are at y=1 at T=6.\n          Then we have actions at T=6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 6 actions to to get to turn12 (y12).\n\n          We need to go from y=1 to y=8 in 6 actions: requires 7 steps -> only if we move up every time.\n\n          But 6 ups would get us to y=1+6=7 at turn12.\n\n          Then at turn12: we are at y=7. Then a12=U -> y13=8, not 9.\n\n          Then we need another action: a13=U -> y14=9.\n\n          That is 7 actions from T=6 to T=12 (6 actions for turns 6 to 11, then turn12: action7) and then turn13: action8? \n\n          Total actions: from T=2 to T=12: 11 actions, and then T=13: action12.\n\n          But then we have 12 actions and we are at y=9 at turn14.\n\n          So it seems we cannot achieve y=9 at turn13 with only the requirement to avoid the cars.\n\n          Given the complexity and time, I will output the 12-action plan.\n\n          Perhaps the problem has a typo in the car state and we can pass through at T=6 if we are not at the freeway at the exact turn when the car is at 0.\n\n          Or perhaps the car at freeway6 at T=6: the span is [-11,0] -> and if the player is at 0, is it a collision? The problem says \"0 in the span\", and 0 is the right endpoint, so included.\n\n          So collision.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is 12 actions as described.\n\n          We'll output the actions for turns 2 to 13.\n\n          Note: the answer format is:\n\n          \\boxed{\n          Turn 2: D\n          Turn 3: S\n          Turn 4: S\n          Turn 5: S\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: U\n          }\n\n          But wait, the last action at turn13 should be to move from y=8 to y=9, and it is the 12th action.\n\n          And we have 12 actions.\n\n          So this is it.\n\n          We have to include turns from 2 to 13 (12 turns).\n\n          Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 12.\n\n          Final answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal with \\(H = 12\\) turns:\n\n1. **Analysis of Car Movements**:  \n   The cars on freeways 1 to 8 move right with given speeds. The key observation is that freeways 2 to 6 are unsafe at turn \\(T = 6\\) due to cars spanning the player's x-position (0). Specifically:\n   - Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5: The car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\) spans \\([-11, 0]\\) at \\(T = 6\\).\n   - Freeway 6: The first car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\) spans \\([-11, 0]\\), and the second car \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 12)\\) spans \\([61, 72]\\) at \\(T = 6\\).\n   - Freeways 1, 7, 8 are safe at \\(T = 6\\):\n     - Freeway 1: Car \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 3)\\) spans \\([-41, -30]\\).\n     - Freeway 7: Cars \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\) and \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\) span \\([-23, -12]\\) and \\([25, 36]\\).\n     - Freeway 8: Same as freeway 7.\n\n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - Avoid freeways 2 to 6 at \\(T = 6\\) by moving to freeway 1 (y=1) by turn 3 and staying there until turn 6.\n   - After turn 6, move upward freely, as freeways 2 to 6 become safe again (e.g., freeway 2 spans \\([1, 12]\\) at \\(T = 7\\)), and higher freeways are safe.\n\n3. **Action Sequence**:  \n   - **Turn 2 (initial)**: At \\(y = 2\\), safe. Move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\).\n   - **Turn 3**: At \\(y = 1\\), safe (car spans \\([-50, -39]\\)). Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\).\n   - **Turn 4**: At \\(y = 1\\), safe (car spans \\([-47, -36]\\)). Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\).\n   - **Turn 5**: At \\(y = 1\\), safe (car spans \\([-44, -33]\\)). Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\).\n   - **Turn 6**: At \\(y = 1\\), safe (car spans \\([-41, -30]\\)). Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\).\n   - **Turn 7**: At \\(y = 2\\), safe (car spans \\([1, 12]\\)). Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\).\n   - **Turn 8**: At \\(y = 3\\), safe (car spans \\([1, 12]\\)). Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n   - **Turn 9**: At \\(y = 4\\), safe (car spans \\([1, 12]\\)). Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n   - **Turn 10**: At \\(y = 5\\), safe (car spans \\([1, 12]\\)). Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n   - **Turn 11**: At \\(y = 6\\), safe (car1 spans \\([49, 60]\\), car2 spans \\([121, 132]\\)). Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n   - **Turn 12**: At \\(y = 7\\), safe (car1 spans \\([13, 24]\\), car2 spans \\([61, 72]\\)). Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n   - **Turn 13**: At \\(y = 8\\), safe (same as freeway 7). Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAfter 12 actions (turns 2 to 13), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14. This sequence ensures no collisions and minimizes the number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{Turn } 2\\!: \\text{D} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 3\\!: \\text{S} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 4\\!: \\text{S} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 5\\!: \\text{S} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 6\\!: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 7\\!: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 8\\!: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 9\\!: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 10\\!: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 11\\!: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 12\\!: \\text{U} \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 13\\!: \\text{U}\n\\end{align*}\n}",

Let me read the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]. In the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). So for a right-moving car, head is the front, so at t1, the span is [tail, head] = [τ, h]. Similarly for left-moving, it would be [head, tail].\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3). So h = -39, τ = -50, d = right, s = 3. Since right-moving, span at t=3 is [τ, h] = [-50, -39].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving, if at turn T you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you only care about cars on y_T at turn T. You don't care about y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nStart at y=1 at t=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 8 units. But I can only move +1, -1, or 0 per turn, so minimum turns if no obstacles would be 8 turns, all up moves.\n\nBut there are cars on freeways, so I might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions, which could take more turns.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, moving down might not be efficient, but sometimes necessary to avoid a collision if I can't go up.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to know when a car has 0 in its span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nBecause collision happens if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in span(T).\n\nSpan(T) for a car is calculated based on t1=3.\n\nSo for any turn T, the span for a car is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)] since it moves right.\n\nt1=3, so T - t1 = Δt.\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\nAt turn T, position relative to t=3.\n\nFor right-moving car: span(T) = [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)]\n\nFor left-moving car: span(T) = [h - s*(T-3), τ - s*(T-3)]\n\nThen 0 is in span if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nNow, in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (-39,-50,right,3) so right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: (-36,-47,right,12) all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)? Head 36, tail 25? That might be a typo or something.\n\nLet's see: (36,25,right,12). If head is 36, tail 25, and right-moving, but tail should be less than head if moving right? No.\n\nFor right-moving, the car is moving to the right, so head is the front, so if it's moving right, head > tail, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1: head h=-39, tail τ=-50, since -39 > -50, so head is right of tail, so as it moves right, head increases.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: first car (-36,-47,right,12), h=-36, τ=-47, -36 > -47, so head at -36, tail at -47.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12). Head=36, tail=25? 36 > 25, so head at 36, tail at 25? But if it's moving right, at t=3, span is [τ,h] = [25,36]? But 25 to 36, and direction right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, when min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, I need to check for each car separately.\n\nAlso, since the player is on a specific y at turn T, I only care about freeway k when player is on y=k.\n\nBut I need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k from 1 to 8, the set of turns T where there is a car on k with 0 in its span at T.\n\nThat is, when it is dangerous to be on that freeway at turn T.\n\nFor freeway k=1:\n\nOne car: τ = -50, h = -39, s=3, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] = [-50 + 3(T-3), -39 + 3(T-3)]\n\nSet min ≤ 0 ≤ max:\n\n-50 + 3(T-3) ≤ 0 ≤ -39 + 3(T-3)\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: -50 + 3(T-3) ≤ 0 => 3(T-3) ≤ 50 => T-3 ≤ 50/3 ≈ 16.666 => T ≤ 19.666, so T ≤ 19 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -39 + 3(T-3) => 39 ≤ 3(T-3) => 13 ≤ T-3 => T ≥ 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\n-39 + 3(T-3) ≥ 0 => 3(T-3) ≥ 39 => T-3 ≥ 13 => T ≥ 16\n\nAnd -50 + 3(T-3) ≤ 0 => 3(T-3) ≤ 50 => T-3 ≤ 16.666 => T ≤ 19\n\nSo T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, for k=2:\n\nCar: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [-47 + 12(T-3), -36 + 12(T-3)]\n\nMin ≤ 0 ≤ max:\n\n-47 +12(T-3) ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12(T-3)\n\nFirst: -47 +12(T-3) ≤ 0 => 12(T-3) ≤ 47 => T-3 ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916 => T ≤ 6.916, so T≤6\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +12(T-3) => 36 ≤ 12(T-3) => 3 ≤ T-3 => T ≥ 6\n\nT ≥ 6 and T ≤ 6, so only T=6.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n-36 +12(T-3) ≥ 0 => 12(T-3) ≥ 36 => T-3 ≥ 3 => T ≥ 6\n\n-47 +12(T-3) ≤ 0 => 12(T-3) ≤ 47 => T-3 ≤ 47/12 = 3.916, so T ≤ 3 + 3.916 = 6.916, so T≤6 since turn integer.\n\nT ≥ 6 and T ≤ 6, so only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly for k=3: same as k=2, since car identical, so only dangerous at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3 has the same car: (-36,-47,right,12), so same as k=2, dangerous only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly k=4: same, T=6.\n\nk=5: same, T=6.\n\nNow k=6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) same as above, dangerous only at T=6.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25? Span at T: [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] = [25 + 12(T-3), 36 + 12(T-3)]\n\nNow min ≤ 0 ≤ max:\n\n25 +12(T-3) ≤ 0 ≤ 36 +12(T-3)\n\nFirst inequality: 25 +12(T-3) ≤ 0 => 12(T-3) ≤ -25 => but 12(T-3) is always non-negative for T≥3, since T-3≥0, so 12(T-3) ≥0, so 25 + something non-negative >0, so never ≤0. Thus min is always positive for T≥3, so 0 cannot be ≤ min since min >0? Let's see.\n\nMin of span is 25 +12(T-3) ≥25 >0 for T≥3, so min >0, so 0 < min, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly max=36+12(T-3)>0.\n\nSo for this car, min >0 for all T≥3, so 0 never in span. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nThus for k=6, only the first car matters, dangerous at T=6, same as others.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-30,-41,right,6) τ=-41? Head=-30, tail=-41? Since right-moving, head > tail? -30 > -41, yes.\n\nSpan: [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] = [-41 + 6(T-3), -30 + 6(T-3)]\n\nSet min ≤0≤ max:\n\n-41 +6(T-3) ≤ 0 ≤ -30 +6(T-3)\n\nFirst inequality: -41 +6(T-3) ≤0 => 6(T-3) ≤41 => T-3 ≤41/6≈6.833 => T≤9.833 so T≤9\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30 +6(T-3) => 30 ≤6(T-3) => 5 ≤ T-3 => T≥8\n\nSo T≥8 and T≤9, so T=8,9.\n\nSecond car on k=7: (18,7,right,6) head=18, tail=7, span: [7 + 6(T-3), 18 + 6(T-3)]\n\nMin =7 +6(T-3) ≥7>0 for T≥3, so min>0, 0 not in span. Never dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8: same as 7, cars (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6), so only first car dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nNow summarize dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): dangerous at T=16,17,18,19\n\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): dangerous at T=6\n\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): dangerous at T=6\n\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): dangerous at T=6\n\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): dangerous at T=6\n\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): dangerous at T=6 (only from first car)\n\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): dangerous at T=8,9\n\nPlayer starts at t=3, y=1.\n\nNeed to reach y=9, which has no cars, so once at y=9, no problem.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no freeway for y=9, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, but freeways are from y=1 to 8 for cars. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=9 is the target position.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nStart at y=1 at t=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, delta y=8, so with all up moves, it would take 8 turns, arriving at t=3+7=10? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nStart t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter one action at t=3, move to y_{t+1} at t=4.\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo from t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter action a_3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\nThen at t=4, action a_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 when y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe turn when I first reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, if I take H actions, from t=3 to t=3+H-1, then at turn t=3+H, y_{3+H} should be 9.\n\nDefine: let the actions be from t=3 to t=3+H-1, so H actions, then after H actions, at turn t=3+H, y_{3+H} =9.\n\nStart at t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter first action (t=3), at t=4, y=1 + Δy_3\n\nAfter second action (t=4), at t=5, y= y_4 + Δy_4, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=3+k, y_{3+k} is the position.\n\nI want y_{3+H} =9 for some H.\n\nSince y starts at 1, to reach 9, I need to increase by 8, so minimum H=8, if all up moves.\n\nThen at t=3+8=11, y=9.\n\nBut I might have collisions or need to wait.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\nFor each y, the dangerous turns when I should not be on that y at that turn.\n\nSince I move one y per turn or stay, I need to plan the path to avoid being on a dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nNow, from above:\n\ny=1 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2 dangerous at T=6\n\ny=3 dangerous at T=6\n\ny=4 dangerous at T=6\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=6\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=6\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=8,9\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=8,9\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nI start at y=1, t=3.\n\ny=1 is dangerous only at T=16-19, which are late, so at t=3, I can move immediately.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nNow, the main issue is around t=6 and t=8,9.\n\nAt t=6, all y from 2 to 6 are dangerous! y=2,3,4,5,6 all dangerous at t=6.\n\ny=2 to 6 all have dangerous at t=6.\n\ny=1 is not dangerous at t=6, only later.\n\ny=7 and y=8 dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=7 and y=8 both dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can arrive early or late.\n\nBut minimal turns, so I want to go as fast as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the dangerous points.\n\nFirst, at t=6, I cannot be on y=2,3,4,5, or 6.\n\nWhere can I be at t=6?\n\nPossible positions: y=0,1,7,8,9 but y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=6, since dangerous only at 16-19.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, but at t=6, they might be safe? Let's check.\n\nFor y=7, dangerous at T=8 and 9, not at t=6, so at t=6, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at t=6.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut at t=6, I might not be at y=7 or above if I start from y=1 at t=3.\n\nt=3, y=1.\n\nAfter actions: let's think about the turn when I am at each position.\n\nI need to define the state over time.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn, the position changes slowly.\n\nAt turn T, y_T.\n\nWe have y_3 =1.\n\nNow, for T=4,5,6,... up to when y=9.\n\nI need to avoid that at turn T, if y_T = k, and k is dangerous at T.\n\nFor T=6, y_6 cannot be 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSo possible y_6: 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=3, to y= something at t=6.\n\nIn three turns: from t=3 to t=6, actions at t=3,4,5 determine y_4,y_5,y_6.\n\ny_6 depends on actions from t=3 to t=5.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_3 =1.\n\nΔy_t can be -1,0,1.\n\nSo y_6 can be from y_3 -3 to y_3 +3, so from -2 to 4, but y must be between 0 and 9, so y_6 between 0 and 4? Min y_6: if all down moves, y_6 =1 -3 = -2, but y>=0, so if I go down, I hit y=0, which is allowed, and stay or something.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so if I try to go below 0, y stays 0, similarly above 9, stays 9, but since we start at y=1 and go to y=9, probably not go below.\n\nBut to avoid, I might go to y=0.\n\nSimilarly, max: if all up, from y=1, after 3 actions, y_6 =1 +3 =4.\n\nActions: at t=3,4,5, three actions.\n\nAfter first action (t=3), y_4 =1 + Δy_3\n\nAfter second (t=4), y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nAfter third (t=5), y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nSo y_6 =1 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_6 =1 + sum of three Δy, each between -1 and 1, so y_6 between 1-3=-2 and 1+3=4.\n\nBut y must be integer 0 to 9, so if y<0, set to 0, if y>9, set to 9.\n\nBut since y=1 to 4, all within 0 to 9, so y_6 can be from 0 to 4.\n\nSpecifically, min y_6=0 (if all down, but y_4=1-1=0, then y_5=0+down=0 or 0+0=0, y_6=0), or max y_6=4 (all up: y_4=1+1=2? y_3=1, a_t=U, y_4=2; a_4=U, y_5=3; a_5=U, y_6=4)\n\ny_6 cannot be 5,6,7,8,9 at t=6 from start, because max is 4.\n\nSo at t=6, possible y_6: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut from above, at t=6, y cannot be 2,3,4,5,6 for safety, but y=5 and 6 are not possible anyway at t=6.\n\ny=2,3,4 are possible but dangerous at t=6.\n\ny=0 and y=1 are safe at t=6.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=6, since dangerous only later.\n\nSo for t=6, to be safe, y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nBecause y=2,3,4 are dangerous and possible, but we must avoid them.\n\ny=0 or 1 are safe.\n\nNow, similarly, at t=8 and t=9, y=7 and y=8 are dangerous.\n\nFirst, let's get to t=6 safely.\n\nSo we need y_6 = 0 or 1.\n\nNow, from y_3=1, we need to reach y_6=0 or 1 in three actions.\n\nThat means we need to not go up too much; in fact, to be at y<=1 at t=6, since we start at y=1.\n\ny_6 <=1.\n\nIf we stay or go down.\n\nFor example, if we do S at t=3, then y_4=1\n\nThen S at t=4, y_5=1\n\nThen S at t=5, y_6=1\n\nOr, D at t=3, y_4=0\n\nThen S at t=4, y_5=0\n\nS at t=5, y_6=0\n\nOr D at t=3, y_4=0, then D at t=4, but y_5=0 (since y=0 min), then S, y_6=0\n\nOr U at t=3, y_4=2, but then if we go down, etc., but we need y_6<=1.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at t=4, then to come back to y=1 or 0 at t=6, we need two down moves, but that might be inefficient.\n\nSince we need to go up eventually, it might be better to stay low at t=6 to avoid danger.\n\nMinimal turns, so we want to go up as much as possible, but here we have to stay at y=0 or 1 at t=6.\n\nSo let's set y_6=1, for example, by doing all S or something.\n\nBut we can do some down to be at y=0, but y=0 is fine, but since we need to go to y=9, staying at y=0 might cost extra moves.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, to minimize H, we should not go down if possible, so staying at y=1 is better.\n\nSo one option: do nothing, all S from t=3 to t=5, but we have to take actions.\n\nActions at t=3,4,5 to set y_6.\n\nTo have y_6=1, we can:\n\n- S at t=3: y_4=1\n\nS at t=4: y_5=1\n\nS at t=5: y_6=1\n\nOr other combinations that keep y=1, like S,S,S or U then D, but U then D might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nThen a_4=D, y_5=1\n\nThen a_5=S, y_6=1\n\nBut this has unnecessary move, better to just stay.\n\nSimilarly, going to y=0 and back might cost more.\n\nSo best to just stay at y=1 for t=4,5,6 by doing S at t=3,4,5.\n\nBut y_6=1, which is safe at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, we can start moving up.\n\nNow, after t=6, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny_6=1.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut there is danger at t=8 and t=9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow, from t=6, y=1, to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum turns: need to increase by 8, so 8 up moves, arriving at t=6+8=14? Let's see.\n\nAt t=6, y_6=1\n\nAction a_6 at t=6, determines y_7\n\na_6 at turn t=6, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nSimilarly, after H actions from t=6, y_{6+H} = y_6 + sum of Δy.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=1, need sum Δy = +8.\n\nMinimum H=8 actions, all U, then at t=6+8=14, y_14=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 at t=8 or t=9, and y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nNow, t=8 and t=9 are specific turns.\n\nLet's see when we might be at y=7 or y=8.\n\nSince we start at y=1 at t=6, and move up.\n\nIf we move directly up, all U, then:\n\nt=6: y=1\n\na_6=U, y_7=2 at t=7\n\na_7=U, y_8=3 at t=8\n\nBut at t=8, y=3, which is not 7 or 8, so safe? y=3 is freeway, but dangerous only at t=6, which is past, so at t=8, y=3 should be safe, since no danger except t=6.\n\nSimilarly, continue:\n\na_8=U, y_9=4 at t=9\n\nt=9, y=4, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=5 at t=10\n\na_10=U, y_11=6 at t=11\n\na_11=U, y_12=7 at t=12\n\na_12=U, y_13=8 at t=13\n\na_13=U, y_14=9 at t=14\n\nNow, check dangers: at t=8, y=3, which is safe.\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\nt=12, y=7, but y=7 dangerous at t=8 and t=9, not at t=12, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=13, y=8, dangerous at t=8,9, not t=13, safe.\n\nSo this seems safe, and takes 11 actions? From t=3 to t=13? Let's list the turns.\n\nStart: t=3, y=1\n\nActions:\n\nt=3: S (to stay for t=6)\n\nIn this plan, from t=3 to t=5, I do S to keep y=1.\n\nThen from t=6 to t=13, all U to go up.\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=3: a_3 = S, so y_4 =1 +0 =1\n\nt=4: a_4 = S, y_5=1+0=1\n\nt=5: a_5 = S, y_6=1+0=1\n\nt=6: a_6 = U, y_7=1+1=2\n\nt=7: a_7 = U, y_8=2+1=3\n\nt=8: a_8 = U, y_9=3+1=4\n\nt=9: a_9 = U, y_10=4+1=5\n\nt=10: a_10 = U, y_11=5+1=6\n\nt=11: a_11 = U, y_12=6+1=7\n\nt=12: a_12 = U, y_13=7+1=8\n\nt=13: a_13 = U, y_14=8+1=9\n\nSo at t=14, y=9.\n\nH= number of actions: from t=3 to t=13, that's 11 actions? t=3 to t=13 inclusive is 11 turns, but actions at t=3 to t=13, 11 actions, then at t=14, y=9.\n\nBut minimal? We have 3 actions of S at start, which are not moving up, so we could go faster.\n\nBut we had to stay at y=1 for t=6 to avoid danger.\n\nAt t=6, we could be at y=0, but that might be worse.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 earlier, but that costs moves.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nWithout obstacles, min H=8, arrive at t=11.\n\nBut with danger at t=6, we had to stay at y=1 until t=6.\n\nt=6 is when we must not be on y=2-6.\n\nIn the above, we stayed at y=1, which is fine.\n\nBut we started moving at t=6.\n\nCan we start moving earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=3, we could go up.\n\nBut if at t=3, we do U, y_4=2\n\nThen at t=4, if we do U, y_5=3\n\nBut at t=5, if we do U, y_6=4, but y=4 dangerous at t=6.\n\nIf we do D at t=5, y_6=3-1=2, but y=2 also dangerous at t=6.\n\nIf at t=4, after y_4=2, we do D, y_5=1\n\nThen at t=5, S, y_6=1, safe.\n\nBut we have an extra down move.\n\nActions: t=3: U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: D, y_5=1\n\nt=5: S, y_6=1\n\nThen from t=6, same as before, all U to t=13, y_14=9.\n\nBut we have one U and one D that cancel, so we wasted two moves compared to all S, but in all S we had three S, here we have U,D,S, so same number of actions to reach y_6=1.\n\nIn both cases, y_6=1 with three actions.\n\nThen to go to y=9, 8 up moves, 8 actions, total 11 actions to arrive at t=14.\n\nIf we go to y=0 at t=6, for example, t=3:D, y_4=0\n\nt=4:S, y_5=0\n\nt=5:S, y_6=0\n\nThen from y=0 at t=6, need to go to y=9, which takes 9 up moves, arrive at t=6+9=15, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=1.\n\nNow, in the up phase, from t=6, y=1 to y=9, with all U, we arrive at t=14.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, we are at y=3 and y=4, which are safe.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, but in this path, we reach y=7 at t=12, which is after t=9, so safe.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=1 earlier or something, but we start at t=3.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=6, we must be at y=0 or 1, but we can be at y=1 at t=6 with fewer actions? No, from t=3 to t=6, three actions must be taken, we need to have y_6=1, which we can with three S, or with moves that end at 1.\n\nBut we cannot skip actions; we have to take action every turn.\n\nSo minimum three actions to get to t=6 with y=1.\n\nThen 8 up moves, total 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the danger at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn this path, at t=8, y=3; t=9, y=4; both not 7 or 8, so no issue.\n\nBut is there a way to go faster to y=9?\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately, but we hit the t=6 danger.\n\nSuppose at t=3, we do U, y_4=2\n\nt=4, we do U, y_5=3\n\nBut at t=5, we cannot do U because y_6=4 dangerous; if we do D, y_6=2, dangerous; if we do S, y_6=3, dangerous. All bad.\n\nSo we must not be at y=2,3,4 at t=5? t=5 is not t=6.\n\nAt t=5, is there danger? t=5, what are dangerous?\n\nThe dangerous times are only at specific turns: for y=2-6, only t=6 is dangerous; for y=1, t=16-19; y=7,8 t=8,9.\n\nAt t=5, no freeway is dangerous, I think.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=3 is not dangerous because dangerous only at t=6 for y=3.\n\nSimilarly, other y.\n\nSo at t=5, I can be at any y, no danger.\n\nBut at t=6, I need to be safe.\n\nSo from above, at t=5, I can be at y=3, for example.\n\nThen at t=5, if I am at y=3, I need to set y_6.\n\nIf I do U, y_6=4, dangerous.\n\nD, y_6=2, dangerous.\n\nS, y_6=3, dangerous.\n\nAll lead to dangerous y at t=6.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 at t=5, because whatever I do, y_6 will be 2,3, or 4, all dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=5, I am at y=2, then:\n\na_5=U, y_6=3 dangerous\n\na_5=D, y_6=1 safe\n\na_5=S, y_6=2 dangerous\n\nSo only if I do D, y_6=1 safe.\n\nIf at t=5, y=4:\n\na_5=U, y_6=5 dangerous? y=5 dangerous at t=6, but y=5 possible? From y=1 at t=3, to y=4 at t=5: need two up moves, y_4=2, y_5=3? y_5=3 if a_3=U, a_4=U.\n\nThen at t=5, y=3.\n\nIf y=4 at t=5, how? y_5=4, from y=1, need three up moves, but only two actions: t=3 and t=4.\n\ny_5 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4\n\ny_3=1, so y_5 =1 + Δy_3 + Δy_4\n\nMax y_5=1+1+1=3, so y_5=3 if both U.\n\nCannot have y_5=4.\n\nSimilarly, min y_5=1-1-1= -1, set to 0? But y_5=0 or 1 or 2 or 3.\n\nAt t=5, possible y_5: 0,1,2,3.\n\nIf y_5=0: then a_5=U, y_6=1 safe; a_5=S, y_6=0 safe; a_5=D, y_6=0 safe. All safe since y=0 or 1.\n\nIf y_5=1: a_5=U, y_6=2 dangerous; a_5=D, y_6=0 safe; a_5=S, y_6=1 safe. So only U is bad.\n\nIf y_5=2: a_5=U, y_6=3 dangerous; a_5=D, y_6=1 safe; a_5=S, y_6=2 dangerous. So only D is safe.\n\nIf y_5=3: a_5=U, y_6=4 dangerous; a_5=D, y_6=2 dangerous; a_5=S, y_6=3 dangerous. All bad! So if at t=5, y=3, no action can make y_6 safe, since all lead to dangerous y.\n\nTherefore, to have a safe y_6, I must not be at y=3 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, if y_5=2, I must do D to go to y_6=1.\n\nIf y_5=1, I can do S or D to stay safe, but not U.\n\nIf y_5=0, all actions safe to y=0 or 1.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, to reach y=9 faster, I should go up as much as possible before t=6, but not too much.\n\nFor example, at t=3, I can do U, y_4=2\n\nThen at t=4, I can do U? But y_5=3, then at t=5, I must do D to go to y_6=2? But y=2 dangerous at t=6.\n\nIf at t=4, after y_4=2, I do D, then y_5=1\n\nThen at t=5, I can do S, y_6=1, safe.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nAt t=3, U, y_4=2\n\nt=4, D, y_5=1\n\nt=5, S, y_6=1\n\nThen from t=6, all U.\n\nBut with U and D, I have extra moves that don't progress.\n\nCompared to all S: t=3,S y_4=1; t=4,S y_5=1; t=5,S y_6=1; same y_6 with three actions.\n\nThen up from there.\n\nIn the all S case, I have no net move.\n\nIn U then D, I have +1 then -1, net zero, same.\n\nBut in the up phase, I start from y=1 at t=6.\n\nCan I be higher at t=6? But at t=6, I can only be up to y=4, but y=4 dangerous, so I cannot be higher than y=1 safely.\n\ny=0 or 1 only.\n\nSo y=1 is best.\n\nNow, back to the up phase.\n\nIn the path above, with all U from t=6, I reach y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I am at y=3 and y=4, safe.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn this path, I reach y=7 at t=12, which is after t=9, so fine.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 earlier by going faster?\n\nFor example, if I start from y=1 at t=6, and go all U, I need 8 moves to y=9.\n\nMinimum.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at a higher y at t=6, but I can't, because of danger.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=0 or something, but worse.\n\nPerhaps during the up phase, I can avoid y=7 and y=8 at t=8 and t=9, but since I start from y=1 at t=6, at t=8 I am at y=3, not 7 or 8.\n\nt=8 is only two turns after t=6.\n\ny_6=1\n\nt=6: a_6=U, y_7=2\n\nt=7: a_7=U, y_8=3\n\nt=8: a_8=U, y_9=4\n\netc., so at t=8, y=3; t=9, y=4.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are later.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut let's list the position over time:\n\nt: position y_t\n\n3: 1\n\n4:1 (if a_3=S)\n\n5:1 (a_4=S)\n\n6:1 (a_5=S)\n\n7:2 (a_6=U)\n\n8:3 (a_7=U)\n\n9:4 (a_8=U)\n\n10:5 (a_9=U)\n\n11:6 (a_10=U)\n\n12:7 (a_11=U)\n\n13:8 (a_12=U)\n\n14:9 (a_13=U)\n\nAt t=12, y=7; but y=7 dangerous at t=8 and t=9, not t=12, so ok.\n\nSimilarly t=13, y=8, dangerous at t=8,9, not t=13, ok.\n\nNow, but we have the danger at t=8 and t=9 for y=7 and y=8, but in this path, we are not on y=7 or 8 at those times.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=4 at t=6, but I can't because dangerous.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 or 8 before t=8 or after, but I need to time it.\n\nBut since I start from y=1 at t=6, I cannot reach y=7 before t=8? t=6 y=1, t=7 y=2, t=8 y=3, so at t=8, y=3, cannot be at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=8, I would need to be at higher y earlier, but I couldn't because of t=6 danger.\n\nFor example, if I were at y=4 at t=6, but dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the above is fine.\n\nBut H=11 actions? From t=3 to t=13, 11 actions, arrive at t=14.\n\nBut minimal possible is 8, but we have 3 extra S at beginning.\n\nCan I use those to go up later? No.\n\nAnother thought: after t=6, I can go up faster? No, only one step per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at an earlier turn by starting to move up earlier, but I have to avoid t=6.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=3, I do nothing, S, y_4=1\n\nt=4, I do U, y_5=2\n\nBut at t=5, y=2, then I need to set y_6.\n\nIf at t=5, I do D, y_6=1, safe.\n\nThen y_6=1 same as before.\n\nThen from t=6, U, etc., same as before.\n\nIf at t=5, I do S, y_6=2, dangerous, not good.\n\nSo y_6=1.\n\nThen same.\n\nAt t=4, if I do U, y_5=2, then t=5 must do D to y_6=1.\n\nBut still, from t=6 y=1 to t=14 y=9.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=6, but that would require down moves, and then need more up moves, worse.\n\nSo I think 11 turns is the minimal for this path.\n\nBut let's check if I can save time with the t=8,9 danger.\n\nIn this case, no issue, but suppose I could be at y=7 at t=10 or something, but no need.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, I need to not be on them at those turns.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=7 at t=12, which is fine.\n\nBut if I could reach y=9 earlier, but I can't because of the start delay.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=9 without stopping, but I have to avoid the danger at t=6.\n\nFor example, if I go up as fast as possible, but at t=6 I would be at y=4, dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the above is correct.\n\nNow, but in the answer, I need to output the actions from t=3 onwards.\n\nIn the plan: all S at t=3,4,5; then all U at t=6 to t=13.\n\nt=13 action to y_14=9.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nt_1 =3, so actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nThen y at t=14 is 9.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach at turn t_1 + H\"\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAnd in the sequence, after H actions, position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=3, after H actions, at turn 3+H, y=9.\n\nWith H=11, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nNow, but can I do with less?\n\nSuppose I go to y=0 at some point, but that would add moves.\n\nFor example, at t=3, D, y_4=0\n\nThen t=4, S, y_5=0\n\nt=5, S, y_6=0\n\nThen from y=0 at t=6, need 9 U to y=9, arrive at t=15, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=7 before t=8, but I can't because of t=6 constraint.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at t=7: from y=1 at t=3, need to increase by 6 in 4 actions? From t=3 to t=7.\n\ny_7 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 + Δy_6? Actions at t=3,4,5,6 determine y_7.\n\ny_7 =1 + sum_{t=3 to 6} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y_7=1+4=5 at t=7.\n\nCannot be y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, min y_7=1-4= -3, set to 0.\n\nSo at t=7, y<=5.\n\nAt t=8, y<=6, etc.\n\nCannot reach high y early.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car on y=1 at later times, but in this path, we leave y=1 early.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=1 until t=6, and y=1 dangerous only at t=16-19, which are later, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nNow, about the action sequence.\n\nIn the plan, I have a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=S, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U.\n\nThen at t=14, y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=3 to t=13.\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I can reach y=9 at turn 13.\n\nThat means at turn t=13, y=9.\n\nt=13 = t_1 + H, with t_1=3, so 3 + H =13, H=10.\n\nSo after 10 actions, at turn 13, y=9.\n\nNow, from start y=1 at t=3, to y=9 at t=13, in 10 turns? The position changes from t=3 to t=13, that's 10 steps? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=3, y=1\n\nt=4, y after action a_3\n\n...\n\nt=13, y after action a_12? Actions from t=3 to t=12 determine y_13.\n\ny_{t} after action a_{t-1}, but let's index properly.\n\nThe state: at turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nThen action a_t determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, take action a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t=3, y_3=1.\n\nAfter a_3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\nAfter a_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nSet y_{3+H} =9.\n\nFor y_{3+H} =9.\n\nIf H=10, then y_{13} =9.\n\nFrom y_3=1 to y_13=9, in 10 steps (from t=4 to t=13, 10 positions?).\n\nThe changes: y_13 = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to 12} Δy_t\n\ny_13 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + ... + Δy_12\n\nThere are 10 terms: t from 3 to 12 inclusive, that's 10 actions.\n\ny_13 = y_3 + sum_{i=3}^{12} Δy_i\n\ny_3=1, y_13=9, so sum_{i=3}^{12} Δy_i =8\n\nEach Δy_i <=1, so to have sum=8, need at least 8 up moves, and no down moves, since down would require more up.\n\nIf all U, sum=10, too much, y_13=1+10=11>9, but y max 9, so if I go above, it caps, but I can go less.\n\nTo reach exactly 9 with min actions, I should have 8 up and 2 other moves that are not up, so S or D, but D would make me go down, requiring more up moves.\n\nTo minimize H, I should have as many U as possible, but with the cap.\n\nSince I need net +8, with 10 actions, I can have 8 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nThen y_13=1 +8*1 +2*0 =9.\n\nIf I have a D, I need an extra U to compensate, so H would be more.\n\nFor example, 9 U and 1 D, but sum=8, y=9, but H=10 actions same.\n\nBut with D, I might go below and come back, wasting moves.\n\nSo best to have 8 U and 2 S with no down.\n\nNow, in this case, I need to be at safe positions.\n\nBut with the t=6 constraint.\n\nNow, y_13=9.\n\nBut I need y_6 to be safe.\n\nt=6 is turn 6.\n\ny_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nIn 10 actions to reach y_13=9.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=12.\n\ny_6 is determined by actions from t=3 to t=5.\n\ny_6 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 =1 + sum_{t=3}^5 Δy_t\n\nTo have y_6 <=1, since must be 0 or 1.\n\nsum_{t=3}^5 Δy_t <=0.\n\nThat is, Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 <=0.\n\nEach >= -1, so possible with all S, or some D.\n\nBut to have net +8 for the whole, with sum first three <=0, then for the remaining 7 actions (t=6 to t=12), I need to have sum = 8 - (something), but y_13 = y_6 + sum_{t=6}^{12} Δy_t\n\ny_13=9, y_6 <=1, so y_13 - y_6 >=8, since y_6<=1.\n\ny_6 <=1, y_13=9, so y_13 - y_6 >=8.\n\nNow, the changes from t=6 to t=12: 7 actions, sum_{t=6}^{12} Δy_t = y_13 - y_6 >=8.\n\nBut each Δy_t <=1, so max increase is 7, which is less than 8, contradiction.\n\ny_13 - y_6 >=8, but with 7 actions, max increase 7, so y_13 <= y_6 +7 <=1+7=8 <9, cannot reach y_13=9 if y_6<=1.\n\nExactly.\n\nIf y_6 <=1, then y_13 <= y_6 + 7 <=1+7=8 <9, so cannot reach y=9 at t=13.\n\nIf y_6=0, y_13 <=0+7=7<9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=13 if y_6<=1.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, cannot achieve, because y_6 must be <=1 for safety, but then y_13 <=8.\n\nThus minimal H=11, with y_13=8? With H=11, y_{14}=9.\n\ny_{3+H}=9.\n\nWith H=11, 3+11=14, y_14=9.\n\nAnd y_6=1, y_14 = y_6 + sum_{t=6}^{13} Δy_t =1 + 8*1 =9, with all U from t=6 to t=13.\n\nAnd the S from t=3 to t=5.\n\nNow, about t=8 and t=9 danger: in this path, at t=8, y=3; t=9, y=4; not 7 or 8.\n\ny=7 at t=12, after danger period.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nFrom t=3 to t=5: S\n\nThen t=6 to t=13: U\n\nNow, actions:\n\nTurn t_1 =3: a_3 = S\n\nTurn t_1 +1 =4: a_4 = S\n\nTurn t_1 +2 =5: a_5 = S\n\nThen turn t_1 +3 =6: a_6 = U\n\nt_1 +4 =7: a_7 = U\n\nt_1 +5 =8: a_8 = U\n\nt_1 +6 =9: a_9 = U\n\nt_1 +7 =10: a_10 = U\n\nt_1 +8 =11: a_11 = U\n\nt_1 +9 =12: a_12 = U\n\nt_1 +10 =13: a_13 = U\n\nH=11 actions, from t=3 to t=13.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_3\n\nt=1: a_4\n\n...\n\nt=10: a_{13} since t_1 +10 =3+10=13.\n\nH=11, t from 0 to 10.\n\nIn the answer, it should list:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut is there any collision? We need to verify.\n\nFor example, at turn T, when on freeway y, check if any car has 0 in span.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=3: y=1, freeway 1. At t=3, for freeway 1, car span: as computed, dangerous only at t=16-19, so at t=3, not dangerous. Safe.\n\nt=4: y=1, same as above, safe.\n\nt=5: y=1, safe.\n\nt=6: y=1, safe, as established.\n\nt=7: y=2, freeway 2. Freeway 2 dangerous only at t=6, not t=7, so safe.\n\nt=8: y=3, freeway 3. Dangerous only at t=6, not t=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4. Dangerous only at t=6, not t=9, safe.\n\nt=10: y=5, freeway 5. Dangerous at t=6 only, safe.\n\nt=11: y=6, freeway 6. Dangerous at t=6 only, safe.\n\nt=12: y=7, freeway 7. Freeway 7 dangerous at t=8 and t=9. At t=12, not dangerous, safe.\n\nt=13: y=8, freeway 8. Dangerous at t=8 and t=9, not t=13, safe.\n\nt=14: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut can I reduce H by using down moves or something? No, as we saw, H=10 impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I go down and up, but that would increase H.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point I go down to avoid, but it costs more moves.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have three S at start, which are necessary to wait for t=6.\n\nAnother thought: since y=0 is safe, and I can go to y=0, but as before, it takes more moves to come back.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=0 at t=4 or something, but then to reach y=9, I need more up moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, with the sequence above.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nSince t_1=3, and actions from t=3 to t=13.\n\nIn the sequence, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nYes.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, it might be implied, or I need to state, but in the format, it just says the sequence.\n\nIn the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if I can avoid the S at start by going to another y.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 or 8 at t=6, but I can't, because y=7 at t=6 is possible? From y=1 at t=3, to y=7 at t=6: actions t=3,4,5.\n\ny_6 =1 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nMax y_6=1+1+1+1? Three actions: Δy_3, Δy_4, Δy_5, y_6=1 + sum, max 1+3=4, as before, cannot be 7.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. This is achieved with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- From turn 3 to turn 5, stay at \\(y = 1\\) using the \"S\" action to avoid the dangerous state at turn 6 for freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- From turn 6 to turn 13, move up using the \"U\" action to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nThe sequence ensures that:\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\(y = 1\\), which is safe since freeway \\(y = 1\\) is only dangerous at turns 16-19.\n- During turns 8 and 9, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\), respectively, avoiding the dangerous states on freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at those turns.\n- The path avoids all collisions, as verified by the car positions and dangerous turn intervals.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nNote: The player's movement:\n  - At each turn, the player chooses an action: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), or S (stay: y remains the same).\n  - The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways 1 to 8. Each freeway may have multiple cars. The car state is given for turn t1=4.\n\nCar update:\n  - Left-moving: the entire span moves left (negative x direction) at speed s per turn.\n  - Right-moving: the entire span moves right (positive x direction) at speed s per turn.\n\nFor a car at freeway k, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n  - For left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the notation says:\n      - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n      - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the input:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) -> since direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? \nWait, the input says: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLet me interpret the input for a right-moving car: \n  \"head\" is the front? In the update for right-moving: they write Span(t1)=[τ, h] and then becomes [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]. \n  So for right-moving, the head h is the larger x-coordinate? But in the input for freeway 1: head=-36, tail=-47. \n  Then if direction is right, the span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the span would be [head, tail] but note that in the update they write [h, τ] and then subtract. \nBut in the input for a left-moving car, if we had one, head would be the larger x? Actually, the update for left-moving: \n  [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt] -> so the head h is the rightmost (larger x) and tail τ is the leftmost (smaller x). \n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) -> right: so span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36] at t1=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> [tail, head] = [-35, -24]? \nWait, the input says (head, tail) but the update uses (head, tail) differently for left and right. \n\nActually, the problem states for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] \nand then moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the input is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nFor right-moving, the head is the front (which is the right end) and tail is the rear (left end). So the span is [tail, head]. \n\nSo for freeway 1: head=-36, tail=-47 -> so the car spans from -47 to -36. \n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: head=-24, tail=-35 -> spans from -35 to -24.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h] -> which is [tail, head]. \n\nSo the representation in the input for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed) meaning:\n  If direction is right: the car occupies [tail, head] (with tail <= head) and moves right.\n  If direction is left: the car occupies [head, tail] (but then head should be the rightmost and tail the leftmost, so head>=tail) and moves left.\n\nIn the given data, all cars are right-moving. Also, note that for freeways 6,7,8 there are two cars.\n\nWe are at turn 4, and we are at position (0,1). We want to go to (0,9). We can only change our y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has its span covering 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: when we move from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, we are considered to be on y at turn T (for collision on freeway y) and then we move to y+1 at the next turn. So at turn T, we are on the freeway we started at.\n\nSpecifically: \n  - At turn T, we are at y_T. \n  - We choose an action a_T which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n  - During turn T, we are present at y_T. So we check collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nTherefore, when we are at (0,1) at turn 4, we are on freeway 1. So we must check the cars on freeway 1 at turn 4.\n\nBut note: the car state given is at turn t1=4. So we have:\n\nFreeway 1: car: tail=-47, head=-36, right, speed=3. \n  At turn 4: the car is at [ -47, -36 ]. \n  Since 0 is not in [-47, -36], we are safe at turn 4.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions from turn 4 onward to reach y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting from t=4, and we are at y=1.\n\nWe note that we can only move up, down, or stay. We want minimal H (number of turns) so that we end at y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves in terms of vertical movement: we need to go from y=1 to y=9, which is 8 steps up. But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid cars, so H might be more than 8.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we step on at each turn whether there is a car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nHow the cars move:\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T (with T>=4), the position of the car is:\n\n  If right-moving: \n      tail_T = tail_{t1} + s*(T - t1)\n      head_T = head_{t1} + s*(T - t1)\n\n  If left-moving: \n      head_T = head_{t1} - s*(T - t1)\n      tail_T = tail_{t1} - s*(T - t1)\n\nBut note: the input for a car is (head_t1, tail_t1, direction, speed). \n\nHowever, for right-moving, we have:\n  tail_T = tail_4 + s*(T-4)\n  head_T = head_4 + s*(T-4)\n\nFor left-moving, we would have:\n  head_T = head_4 - s*(T-4)\n  tail_T = tail_4 - s*(T-4)\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving.\n\nLet me write down the car positions at any turn T (>=4) for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head_4=-36, tail_4=-47, right, s=3.\n  At turn T: \n      tail = -47 + 3*(T-4)\n      head = -36 + 3*(T-4)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: head_4=-24, tail_4=-35, right, s=12.\n  At turn T: \n      tail = -35 + 12*(T-4)\n      head = -24 + 12*(T-4)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  head_4=-24, tail_4=-35, right, s=12 -> same as freeway2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars:\n  First car: same as above: (-24,-35,right,12) -> tail=-35+12*(T-4), head=-24+12*(T-4)\n  Second car: (48,37,right,12) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? Then for right-moving: the car spans [37,48] at turn4.\n      At turn T: tail=37+12*(T-4), head=48+12*(T-4)\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  First car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> tail=-35+6*(T-4), head=-24+6*(T-4)\n  Second car: (24,13,right,6) -> tail=13+6*(T-4), head=24+6*(T-4)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway k at turn T if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn4, y=1. We are safe at turn4 on freeway1 because the car on freeway1 at turn4: [-47,-36] -> 0 is not in that interval.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. Since we want minimal time, we prefer moving up when possible.\n\nBut we must check the freeways above: freeway2,3,...,8.\n\nLet me compute when each freeway is dangerous (i.e., when a car covers 0) for each freeway.\n\nFor a freeway, we have one or two cars. We need to know the time intervals (if any) during which 0 is covered.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving continuously in the x-direction. Since they are moving at constant speed, the coverage of 0 happens over a continuous interval of turns.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, the car covers 0 at turn T if:\n   tail_T <= 0 <= head_T.\n\nFor a right-moving car:\n   tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0 <= head_4 + s*(T-4)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n   tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0  => T-4 >= (0 - tail_4) / s   => T >= 4 + ceil( ( - tail_4 ) / s )? \nBut note: we are dealing with integers? The positions are integers, and time is integer.\n\nActually, we can compute the exact interval of T (integer) for which 0 is covered.\n\nWe require:\n   tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0 <= head_4 + s*(T-4)\n\n=> \n   (0 - head_4) / s <= T-4 <= (0 - tail_4) / s\n\nBut note: because the car is moving right, the left end (tail) increases and the right end (head) increases.\n\nSo the car covers 0 from the moment the tail passes 0 to the moment the head passes 0? Actually, the car covers 0 when the entire segment covers 0? No, the segment [tail, head] covers 0 if tail<=0<=head.\n\nSo the time when the car covers 0 is when:\n   tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0   and   head_4 + s*(T-4) >= 0\n\nRearranged:\n   T >= 4 + ceil( ( - head_4 ) / s )   ??? Let me do it properly.\n\nActually:\n   tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0   => T-4 >= ceil( ( - tail_4 ) / s )? But note: we are in integers and the inequalities are inclusive.\n\nWe can write:\n\n   T >= 4 + ceil( ( - head_4 ) / s )   -> no, that doesn't look right.\n\nLet me define:\n\n   The car covers 0 at time T if:\n      tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0   => T <= ( - tail_4 ) / s + 4   [but note: this is an upper bound?]\n\nActually, we have:\n\n   tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0   => s*(T-4) <= - tail_4   => T-4 <= (- tail_4) / s   => T <= 4 + floor( (- tail_4) / s )? \nBut that would be for the condition tail_4+s*(T-4) <=0, and similarly for the other condition.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nCondition 1: tail_4 + s*(T-4) <= 0 \n   => s*(T-4) <= - tail_4\n   => T-4 <= (- tail_4) / s   [if s>0]\n\nCondition 2: head_4 + s*(T-4) >= 0\n   => s*(T-4) >= - head_4\n   => T-4 >= ceil( (- head_4) / s )   ??? \n\nBut note: we are in integers. The condition for T is:\n\n   T-4 must be at least the smallest integer k such that s*k >= - head_4, and at most the largest integer k such that s*k <= - tail_4? \n\nActually, the condition is:\n\n   k = T-4 must satisfy:\n        s*k >= - head_4    and   s*k <= - tail_4? \n\nBut let me write:\n\n   Condition 1: tail_4 + s*k <= 0  -> k <= (- tail_4) / s\n   Condition 2: head_4 + s*k >= 0  -> k >= (- head_4) / s\n\nSo k must be in the interval [ ceil( (- head_4) / s ) , floor( (- tail_4) / s ) ]? \n\nBut note: if we rearrange condition 2: \n   head_4 + s*k >= 0  => s*k >= - head_4  => k >= ceil( (- head_4) / s )   [because k is integer]\n\nSimilarly, condition 1: \n   tail_4 + s*k <= 0  => s*k <= - tail_4  => k <= floor( (- tail_4) / s )   [because k is integer]\n\nBut note: if (- head_4) is positive? Since head_4 is negative in our data, then -head_4 is positive.\n\nExample: freeway1, head_4=-36, tail_4=-47, s=3.\n\nThen:\n   Condition2: k >= ceil( (36) / 3 ) = ceil(12) = 12.\n   Condition1: k <= floor( (47) / 3 ) = floor(15.666) = 15.\n\nSo k in [12,15]. Then T in [4+12, 4+15] = [16,19].\n\nSo at turns 16,17,18,19, the car on freeway1 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: head_4=-24, tail_4=-35, s=12.\n\n   Condition2: k >= ceil( (24) / 12 ) = ceil(2) = 2.\n   Condition1: k <= floor( (35) / 12 ) = floor(2.916) = 2.\n\nSo k=2 -> only turn T=4+2=6.\n\nSo at turn6, freeway2 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,4,5: same as freeway2 -> dangerous only at turn6.\n\nNow freeway6 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as freeway2: so dangerous at turn6.\n\nSecond car: head_4=48, tail_4=37, s=12. \n  This car is moving right. \n  Condition for covering 0:\n      Condition2: k >= ceil( (-48)/12 ) = ceil(-4) = -4   -> but k>=0? T>=4, so k>=0. But -4 is less than 0, so the lower bound is 0?\n      Actually, we must consider: head_4 + s*k >=0 -> 48 + 12*k >=0 -> always true for k>=0? \n      Condition1: tail_4 + s*k <=0 -> 37+12*k<=0 -> 12*k <= -37 -> k<= -37/12 -> k<=-3.083 -> which is impossible since k>=0.\n\nSo the second car on freeway6 never covers 0. Therefore, freeway6 is dangerous only at turn6 (because of the first car).\n\nFreeway7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head_4=-24, tail_4=-35, s=6.\n   Condition2: k>= ceil(24/6)=ceil(4)=4.\n   Condition1: k<= floor(35/6)=floor(5.833)=5.\n   So T in [4+4,4+5] = [8,9].\n\nSecond car: head_4=24, tail_4=13, s=6.\n   Condition2: k>= ceil( (-24)/6 )=ceil(-4)=-4 -> so k>=0 (since k>=0) -> condition2 always holds for k>=0? \n        But we require: 24+6*k>=0 -> always true for k>=0.\n   Condition1: 13+6*k<=0 -> 6*k<=-13 -> k<=-13/6 -> k<=-2.166 -> impossible.\n\nSo second car never covers 0. Therefore, freeway7 is dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways by turn:\n\nTurn 6: freeways 2,3,4,5,6 are dangerous (because they each have a car that covers 0 at turn6).\nTurn 8: freeways 7,8 are dangerous.\nTurn 9: freeways 7,8 are dangerous.\n\nAdditionally, freeway1 is dangerous at turns 16,17,18,19. But since we are going to get to 9 quickly, we may not be around at those turns.\n\nWe start at turn4 at y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves: 8 moves up. So at least 8 turns (from turn4 to turn11: because turn4 is our start, then we do 8 moves: turn4, turn5, ... turn11).\n\nBut we might have to wait at some freeways to avoid the dangerous turns.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path. We want the minimal H, so we try to go as fast as possible.\n\nWe are at turn4, y=1: safe.\n\nWe can do:\n\nOption 1: Go up as fast as possible.\n\nTurn4 (current): y=1 (safe, as we saw).\nTurn5: we can choose to go up to y=2. Then at turn5, we are on freeway2? \n  But at turn5, freeway2: we have the car: \n      tail = -35 + 12*(5-4) = -35+12 = -23\n      head = -24+12 = -12\n  0 is not in [-23,-12] -> safe? \n  However, note: at turn5, freeway2 is not dangerous (only at turn6) -> safe.\n\nTurn6: we go up to y=3. But at turn6, we are on freeway3? \n  We are at y=3 at turn6. Freeway3: dangerous at turn6? Yes. \n  So if we are at freeway3 at turn6, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway3 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 2,3,4,5,6 at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid freeways 7,8 at turns8 and9.\n\nSo at turn6, we must not be on freeways 2 to 6.\n\nOur current plan:\n\nTurn4: y=1 -> safe.\nTurn5: go up to y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn5: not dangerous).\nTurn6: we must not be on freeways 2,3,4,5,6. \n   Currently we are at y=2. If we go up to y=3, we are on freeway3 -> collision.\n   If we go down to y=1, then we are on freeway1 -> freeway1 is only dangerous at turns16-19, so safe at turn6.\n   If we stay at y=2, then we are on freeway2 -> dangerous at turn6 -> collision.\n\nSo at turn6, we must be at y=0,1, or 7,8,9? \n   But we are at y=2 at the start of turn6 (if we went up at turn5). We can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=2 at turn6 (if we got there at turn5) we can only go to y=1,2, or 3.\n\nBut:\n   y=1: freeway1 -> safe at turn6.\n   y=2: freeway2 -> dangerous -> not safe.\n   y=3: freeway3 -> dangerous -> not safe.\n\nSo the only safe move at turn6 from y=2 is to go down to y=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn4: y=1 (safe)\nTurn5: U -> y=2 (safe)\nTurn6: D -> y=1 (safe)\n\nNow at turn7: we are at y=1. We can then go up.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid freeways 7 and 8 at turns8 and9.\n\nAt turn7: we are at y=1. We can go up to y=2.\n\nAt turn8: we must avoid freeways 7 and 8. So we must not be at y=7 or 8 at turn8.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn7. We can go to y=1,2,3 at turn8.\n\nNone of freeways 1,2,3 are dangerous at turn8? \n  Freeway1: dangerous at turns16-19 -> safe at turn8.\n  Freeway2: dangerous only at turn6 -> safe at turn8.\n  Freeway3: same as freeway2 -> safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=1,2,3 at turn8.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we can go to y=3 at turn8? \n\nBut wait, we are at y=2 at turn7. Then at turn8 we can go to y=3.\n\nAt turn8: y=3 -> freeway3 -> safe.\n\nBut then at turn9: we are at y=3. We can go up to y=4. But at turn9, we must avoid freeways7 and8? \n   We are at y=4 -> freeway4 -> which is not 7 or 8 -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway4 is dangerous only at turn6 -> safe at turn9.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nTurn7: U -> y=2 (from y=1) -> but wait, we were at y=1 at turn7? \n\nLet me recount:\n\nTurn4: y=1\nTurn5: U -> y=2\nTurn6: D -> y=1\nTurn7: now at y=1. We choose U -> at the end of turn7 we are at y=2.\n\nThen turn8: at y=2, we choose U -> to y=3.\nThen turn9: at y=3, we choose U -> to y=4.\n\nBut we want to get to y=9. This will take 5 more moves: from y=4 to y=9: 5 moves.\n\nBut wait, we are at turn9 at y=3? Then we go to y=4 at turn9? Then at turn9 we are at y=4? \n\nActually, at turn9: \n   We start turn9 at y=3 (from turn8). Then we choose U -> then at the end of turn9 we are at y=4.\n\nSo at turn9, we are present at y=3 (during the turn) and then we move to y=4.\n\nTherefore, at turn9, we are on freeway3 -> safe.\n\nNow we continue:\n\nTurn10: from y=4, we can go to y=5 -> freeway5: dangerous only at turn6 -> safe.\nTurn11: y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous only at turn6 -> safe? \n   But freeway6 has two cars. The first car: dangerous at turn6, but at turn11, \n        tail = -35 + 12*(11-4) = -35 + 12*7 = -35+84=49\n        head = -24+84=60 -> so 0 not in [49,60] -> safe.\n   The second car: tail=37+12*7=37+84=121, head=48+84=132 -> safe.\n\nTurn12: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn12, \n   Check freeway7: \n        First car: tail=-35+6*(12-4)= -35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> so 0 not in [13,24] -> safe.\n        Second car: tail=13+6*8=13+48=61, head=24+48=72 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we must avoid freeways7 and8 at turns8 and9. We are at turn12 -> safe.\n\nTurn13: y=8 -> freeway8: \n        First car: tail=-35+6*(13-4)= -35+54=19, head=-24+54=30 -> safe.\n        Second car: tail=13+6*9=13+54=67, head=24+54=78 -> safe.\n\nTurn14: y=9 -> we are at the goal.\n\nBut wait, we are at y=8 at turn13. Then we choose U at turn13: then at the end of turn13 we are at y=9. \n  Then at turn14, we would be at y=9? But the problem says we reach (0,9) at the last turn of the sequence.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: we are at turn4, and we do H actions? The problem says: sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \n   a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo we start at turn4 (t=0) and we do H actions. The last action is at turn4+H-1, and then we are at (0,9).\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nIn the above, we have:\n\nTurn4: start at y=1 (we don't take an action at turn4? Or do we? \n\nThe problem: \n   We are at turn t1=4, and we are at (0,1). \n   We are to choose actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until we reach (0,9).\n\nSo we choose an action at turn4, turn5, ... until the turn when we first reach (0,9).\n\nSo at turn4, we choose an action. Then at turn5, we are at the new position.\n\nWe start at turn4: y=1.\n\nWe must choose an action at turn4.\n\nIn the above, we did:\n\nTurn4: we choose U -> then at turn5 we are at y=2.\n\nBut we could also choose D or S at turn4.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we want to go up.\n\nBut we saw that if we go up at turn4 and turn5, we get to y=2 at turn5, then at turn6 we have to go down to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid going up at turn4? \n\nBut if we stay at turn4: at turn4 we are at y=1 (safe) and we choose S -> then at turn5 we are still at y=1. \nThen at turn5 we can go up to y=2. Then at turn6 we are at y=2 -> which is dangerous? \n   At turn6, if we are at y=2 -> freeway2 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we have to go down at turn6 from y=2 to y=1.\n\nSo that doesn't save a turn.\n\nWhat if we go down at turn4? Then we go to y=0. Then at turn5 we can go up to y=1, then turn6 we are at y=1 (safe). \nBut that delays our progress.\n\nSo the above plan seems reasonable.\n\nBut let's write the sequence we thought:\n\nTurn4: U -> then at turn5: y=2\nTurn5: U? -> but wait, at turn5 we are at y=2, then we choose an action for turn5. \n   We cannot choose U at turn5 because then at turn6 we would be at y=3 -> collision.\n\nIn the above I had:\n\nTurn4: U -> y=2 at turn5.\nTurn5: D? -> but that would go to y=1 at turn6.\n\nBut wait, at turn5 we are at y=2. We choose D at turn5: then at turn6 we are at y=1.\n\nBut then we lost progress.\n\nAlternatively, at turn5 we could stay? Then at turn6 we are at y=2 -> but that is dangerous.\n\nSo we must go down at turn5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn4: U -> then turn5: y=2\nTurn5: D -> then turn6: y=1\n\nThen turn6: we are at y=1. Now we choose an action at turn6: we can go up.\n\nTurn6: U -> then turn7: y=2\n\nBut at turn6: we are on freeway1 -> safe. Then we choose U: so at turn7 we are at y=2.\n\nThen turn7: at y=2, we can choose U: then at turn8 we are at y=3.\n\nAt turn8: we are at freeway3 -> safe (because freeway3 is dangerous only at turn6).\n\nThen turn8: U -> turn9: y=4\n\nThen turn9: U -> turn10: y=5\n\nThen turn10: U -> turn11: y=6\n\nThen turn11: U -> turn12: y=7\n\nThen turn12: U -> turn13: y=8\n\nThen turn13: U -> turn14: y=9\n\nSo we reach at turn14.\n\nTotal turns: from turn4 to turn14: that's 11 turns? But note: we are counting the actions:\n\nWe take actions at:\n  turn4, turn5, turn6, turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10, turn11, turn12, turn13 -> 10 actions? \n\nBut then at turn14, we are at y=9. However, the last action is at turn13, and we are at y=9 at the end of turn13? \n\nWait, the state after an action:\n\nAt turn4: we start at y=1. We choose a4 = U -> then y5 = y4 +1 = 2.\n\nAt turn5: we start at y=2. We choose a5 = D -> then y6 = 2-1=1.\n\nAt turn6: we start at y=1. We choose a6 = U -> then y7 = 1+1=2.\n\nAt turn7: we start at y=2. We choose a7 = U -> then y8=3.\n\nAt turn8: we start at y=3. We choose a8 = U -> then y9=4.\n\nAt turn9: we start at y=4. We choose a9 = U -> then y10=5.\n\nAt turn10: we start at y=5. We choose a10 = U -> then y11=6.\n\nAt turn11: we start at y=6. We choose a11 = U -> then y12=7.\n\nAt turn12: we start at y=7. We choose a12 = U -> then y13=8.\n\nAt turn13: we start at y=8. We choose a13 = U -> then y14=9.\n\nSo at the end of turn13, we are at y=9. And we have taken 10 actions: from turn4 to turn13.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions. And we reach at turn t1 + H - 1 = 4 + H - 1.\n\nWe want y_{4+H-1}=9.\n\nWe have y14=9, and 14 = 4 + H - 1 -> 4 + H - 1 = 14 -> H = 11.\n\nBut we took 10 actions? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions: \n   a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13 -> 10 actions.\n\nThen H=10. Then the last state is at turn4+10-1 = 13? But we are at turn13 at the end of the last action? \n\nAt the beginning of turn4: we are at (0,1). \nAfter action a4 (at turn4) we are at turn5 at y=2? \nBut the problem says: the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then we update to the next turn.\n\nSo the state after the last action: we take a_{4+H-1} at turn 4+H-1, and then we are at turn 4+H.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn 4+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1: \n   a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter applying these actions, we are at the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait, there is a confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me read: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at the state at the end of that turn, which is turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the state after the action taken at turn t is the state at turn t+1? \n\nBut the problem states the player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, then we get y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, if we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1 (total H actions), then we get the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be before the last action.\n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nLooking back: \n   \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? Or at the end?\n\nActually, the state y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t? Or during turn t?\n\nThe collision condition says: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, then check the cars at turn T.\n\nSo the position y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t (and then we are present on that freeway during the turn).\n\nAnd then we choose an action a_t, which updates the position to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo we are at y_{t} at the beginning of turn t.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1: \n   actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-2} \n   because t from 0 to H-1 gives H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions: t=0,1,...,H-1 -> so at turn t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the state after these actions: we would have updated to turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action at that turn? But that action might change the position? \n\nBut if we are already at 9, we can choose S to stay.\n\nSo the minimal H must be such that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we have taken H actions? \n\nWait, the actions taken are at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe state at the beginning of turn t1 is given: (0,1).\n\nAfter action a_{t1} (at turn t1), we update to y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1} (at turn t1+1), we update to y_{t1+2}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1), we update to y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThat means we want the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nBut the actions taken at turn t1+H-1 will then update it to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta, which might be 9 (if we choose S) or 10 (if U) or 8 (if D). \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we don't care about the action at that turn? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we are taking an action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we want to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn, then we take an action and then we are at 9+Delta at the next turn.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the turn we finish. \n\nRe-reading: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we take an action at that turn? But if we take an action, we might leave? \n\nThe problem does not say we have to stay there. It just says to reach (0,9). \n\nSo it's okay if we then leave? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 (beginning of the turn). Then we take an action, but that doesn't affect the fact that we were at 9 at that turn.\n\nSo the sequence of actions we take is for turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions), and we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 (which is the last turn we are required to be at 9).\n\nIn our plan, we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of some turn.\n\nIn the previous plan, we reached y=9 at the beginning of turn14? \n\nBut we started at turn4 (beginning: y=1).\n\nAfter action at turn4: we are at turn5: y=2.\n...\nAfter action at turn13: we are at turn14: y=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn14, we are at y=9. Therefore, we set H-1 = 14 - t1? \n\nt1=4, so turn t1+H-1 = 4+H-1 = 14 -> H-1 = 10 -> H=11.\n\nBut then the actions are from t=0 to 10? That would be 11 actions: turn4 to turn14? \n\nBut we only have 10 actions: turn4 to turn13.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions until we are at 9, and the last action is the one that gets us to 9? \n\nBut the update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, so the action at turn t moves us to the next state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y_t at the beginning of turn t, and we take action a_t, then at the beginning of turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1.\n\nTherefore, we want T = t1+H-1, and we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn T.\n\nThe actions taken are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which updates the state to turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet T_start = t1 = 4.\nAt the beginning of turn T_start: y_{T_start} = 1.\n\nWe take an action at turn T_start = 4: a_4, then at the beginning of turn5: y5 = y4 + Delta.\n\nWe take an action at turn5: a_5, then at the beginning of turn6: y6 = y5 + Delta.\n\n...\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the beginning of some turn T.\n\nThe number of actions taken from turn4 to turn T-1 is (T-1) - 4 + 1 = T-4.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: that means we take H actions, at turns: 4,5,...,4+H-1.\n\nThe last action is at turn 4+H-1, and it updates the state to turn 4+H.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn 4+H is the result after the last action.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 4+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we do not need to take an action at turn 4+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence includes H actions, including an action at turn 4+H-1.\n\nThis suggests that the condition \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, which is before the action at that turn.\n\nThen the action at turn t1+H-1 would then update it to y_{t1+H}, which might not be 9.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the action at turn t1+H-1 is not necessary for being at 9, but it is part of the sequence.\n\nHowever, if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that moves us away, then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, so it's okay.\n\nIn our case, we can then choose S at the last action to stay.\n\nBut in our simulation, we reached y=9 at the beginning of turn14. So we want:\n\n   t1+H-1 = 14  => 4 + H - 1 = 14  => H = 11.\n\nThen the actions are for turns: 4,5,6,...,14 (11 actions).\n\nBut we only described actions from turn4 to turn13 (10 actions) that got us to y=9 at the beginning of turn14.\n\nSo we need one more action: at turn14, we would choose S to stay at y=9.\n\nSo the complete plan:\n\nTurn4: U -> to y=2 at turn5\nTurn5: D -> to y=1 at turn6\nTurn6: U -> to y=2 at turn7\nTurn7: U -> to y=3 at turn8\nTurn8: U -> to y=4 at turn9\nTurn9: U -> to y=5 at turn10\nTurn10: U -> to y=6 at turn11\nTurn11: U -> to y=7 at turn12\nTurn12: U -> to y=8 at turn13\nTurn13: U -> to y=9 at turn14\nTurn14: S -> to y=9 at turn15\n\nBut then at the beginning of turn14, we are at y=9? And then we take an action at turn14 (S) to remain at 9.\n\nBut the condition is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1=4+11-1=14, we are at y=9. That is satisfied.\n\nThen we take an action at turn14 (S) which is the last action in the sequence.\n\nBut do we need to take that action? The goal is to be at (0,9) at turn14 (beginning), and then we take the action to stay, but that's fine.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the down move and find a way to go faster.\n\nWhat if at turn4 we choose S? \n   Then at turn5: y=1.\n   Then turn5: U -> turn6: y=2 -> but at turn6, freeway2 is dangerous -> collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if we go down at turn4 to y=0? \n   Turn4: D -> turn5: y=0.\n   Then turn5: U -> turn6: y=1 -> safe at turn6 (freeway1 safe).\n   Then we continue up: \n        turn6: U -> turn7: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn7: \n               tail=-35+12*(7-4)= -35+36=1, head=-24+36=12 -> 0 in [1,12]? no, 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        turn7: U -> turn8: y=3 -> freeway3: at turn8, \n               tail=-35+12*4= -35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n        turn8: U -> turn9: y=4 -> safe.\n        turn9: U -> y=5\n        turn10: U -> y=6\n        turn11: U -> y=7 -> but at turn11, freeway7: \n               First car: tail=-35+6*(11-4)= -35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n               Second car: safe.\n        turn12: U -> y=8 -> freeway8: at turn12,\n               First car: tail=-35+6*8= -35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n        turn13: U -> y=9\n\nSo then we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn14.\n\nAnd we have taken 9 actions: \n   turn4: D\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U -> then at turn14: y=9.\n\nThen we need to have H such that t1+H-1=14 -> 4+H-1=14 -> H=11, and then we take 11 actions? \nBut we only have 10 actions from turn4 to turn13.\n\nWe need one more action at turn14: we choose S.\n\nSo:\n\n   turn4: D\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U  -> gets us to y=9 at turn14.\n   turn14: S\n\nTotal actions: 11.\n\nBut we reached at turn14, same as before.\n\nIs there a way to get to y=9 earlier? For example, at the beginning of turn13.\n\nThat means we want y_13=9.\n\nWith the moves: we need to go from y4=1 to y13=9: that's 8 moves up. So we need 8 up moves and possibly some waits.\n\nBut we have 9 turns from turn4 to turn12 (actions at turn4 to turn12) to affect the state from turn5 to turn13.\n\nWe start at turn4: y4=1.\n\nAfter 8 up moves and 0 waits, we would be at y_{4+8}=y12=1+8=9.\n\nSo we want to be at y12=9 at the beginning of turn12.\n\nBut turn12 = t1+8? t1=4, so 4+8=12.\n\nThen we take 8 actions: from turn4 to turn11.\n\nThen at the beginning of turn12, we are at 9.\n\nThen we need H such that t1+H-1=12 -> 4+H-1=12 -> H=9.\n\nThen the actions are from turn4 to turn4+8=12? But that would be turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 -> 9 actions.\n\nBut the last action at turn12 would update to turn13, but we don't care as long as at turn12 we are at 9.\n\nSo we need to get to y=9 at turn12.\n\nNow, can we go from y=1 at turn4 to y=9 at turn12 with only up moves? 8 up moves in 8 actions: \n   Actions at turn4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: all U.\n\nThen we would be:\n   turn5: y=2\n   turn6: y=3 -> but at turn6, freeway3 is dangerous -> collision.\n\nSo we have to avoid turn6 on freeways2-6.\n\nWe might skip one of the moves to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at turn6.\n\nFor example, if we do 7 up moves and 1 wait, then we can only get to y=1+7=8 by turn12.\n\nWe need 8 up moves.\n\nWe could do a down move and then two up moves to compensate, but that would take extra actions.\n\nMinimal moves: we need exactly 8 up moves. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nThe only dangerous turns are 6,8,9.\n\nAt turn6, we must not be on freeways2,3,4,5,6.\n\nAt turn8,9: must not be on freeways7,8.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn4.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn12.\n\nWe have 8 moves: all U.\n\nBut we must be at a safe freeway at turn6.\n\nAt turn6, we are at y = 1 + (number of U from turn4 to turn5) + (number of U from turn5 to turn6) \n   = 1 + a4 + a5, where a4 and a5 are either 1 (if U) or 0 (if S) or -1 (if D).\n\nWe need to be at y6 not in {2,3,4,5,6}. So y6 must be in {0,1,7,8,9}. \n\nBut we start at 1. We can only move by 1 per turn. \n\nAt turn5: we can be at y5 = 1 + a4 (which can be -1,0,1) -> so y5 in {0,1,2}.\nAt turn6: y6 = y5 + a5 -> so from y5 in {0,1,2}, we can be at { -1,0,1,2,3} but y in [0,9] so {0,1,2,3}.\n\nThe only safe y6 in {0,1} (because 7,8,9 are not reachable from y5<=2 by one move).\n\nSo we must be at y6=0 or 1.\n\nTo be at y6=1: we must have y5=1 and a5=S, or y5=0 and a5=U, or y5=2 and a5=D.\n\nTo be at y6=0: we must have y5=0 and a5=S, or y5=1 and a5=D.\n\nNow, we started at y4=1.\n\nAt turn4: we choose a4.\n\nIf we choose a4=S: then y5=1.\n   Then at turn5: to be at y6=1, we choose a5=S.\n        Then y6=1.\n   Or to be at y6=0: we choose a5=D -> then y6=0.\n\nIf we choose a4=U: then y5=2.\n   Then at turn5: to be at y6=1: choose a5=D -> y6=1.\n   Or to be at y6=0: choose a5= two downs? not possible.\n\nIf we choose a4=D: then y5=0.\n   Then at turn5: to be at y6=1: choose a5=U -> y6=1.\n   Or to be at y6=0: choose a5=S -> y6=0.\n\nSo we can be at y6=1 or 0.\n\nBut we want to minimize the total turns, so we prefer to be at y6=1 so we don't lose progress.\n\nSo let's choose to be at y6=1.\n\nOptions:\n   Option A: \n        turn4: S, turn5: S -> then y6=1.\n   Option B:\n        turn4: U, turn5: D -> then y6=1.\n   Option C:\n        turn4: D, turn5: U -> then y6=1.\n\nNow, we also have to avoid turn8 and turn9 on freeways7,8.\n\nAt turn8: we are at y8.\n   We require y8 not in {7,8}.\n   Similarly, at turn9: y9 not in {7,8}.\n\nBut we want to go to 9, so we will be at 8 or 9 at some point.\n\nWe have 6 more actions after turn5 (turn6 to turn11) to go from y6=1 to y12=9.\n\nThat requires 8 moves up? But we have 6 actions for 8 moves? No, we need to gain 8 in y? \n\nFrom y6=1 to y12=9: we need to gain 8. We have 6 actions: turn6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 6 moves.\n\nSo we can only gain 6, which would get us to y12=7, not 9.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to get to y12=9 with only 8 actions (from turn4 to turn11) because we are delayed at turn6.\n\nWe need at least 8 up moves, and we lost two moves (at turn4 and turn5) to avoid the collision at turn6? \n\nIn the first option, we did two moves that didn't gain (or even lost) to avoid turn6, and then we had to do 8 up moves, which took 8 actions, so total actions: 2 (for the first two turns) + 8 = 10, then one more to stay, total 11.\n\nAlternatively, if we can avoid the collision without losing progress, but we can't because at turn6 we can only be at 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have two viable paths:\n\nPath1 (the first one):\n   turn4: U\n   turn5: D\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: S\n\nBut this has 11 actions.\n\nPath2 (with down at turn4):\n   turn4: D\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: S\n\nAlso 11 actions.\n\nBut in path2, we went down to 0, which might be safe? \n   At turn4: we are at y=1, then we choose D -> then at turn5 we are at y=0.\n   At turn5: we are at freeway0? But freeways are from 1 to 8. The player can be at y=0, which is not a freeway? \n        The collision condition: only if we are on freeway y (which is 1..8) then check. \n        At y=0, we are not on any freeway -> safe.\n   Similarly, at turn5: we are at y=0 -> not on freeway -> safe.\n   Then at turn5, we choose U -> then at turn6 we are at y=1 -> freeway1: safe at turn6.\n\nThen we go up every turn.\n\nBut we must check freeways at each turn.\n\nSpecifically, at turn8: we will be at y=?\n   turn6: y=1\n   turn7: U -> y=2\n   turn8: U -> y=3 -> freeway3: safe (only dangerous at turn6)\n\nAt turn9: y=4\nAt turn10: y=5\nAt turn11: y=6 -> freeway6: \n        at turn11: \n           first car: tail=-35+12*(11-4)= -35+84=49, head=-24+84=60 -> safe.\n           second car: tail=37+84=121, head=48+84=132 -> safe.\nAt turn12: y=7 -> freeway7: \n        first car: tail=-35+6*(12-4)= -35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> 0 not in [13,24] -> safe.\n        second car: safe.\nAt turn13: y=8 -> freeway8: \n        first car: tail=-35+6*(13-4)= -35+54=19, head=-24+54=30 -> safe.\nAt turn14: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo this path is also safe.\n\nBut both take 11 actions.\n\nIs there a path with 10 actions? That would mean we reach at turn13 (since 4+10-1=13).\n\nSo we want y13=9.\n\nWe need to go from y4=1 to y13=9: 8 moves up in 9 actions (from turn4 to turn12).\n\nThat means we have 9 actions to do 8 up moves and 1 other move (either a stay or a down, but down would be bad).\n\nSo one of the actions must be a stay.\n\nWe need to arrange the stay so that we avoid the dangerous turns.\n\nDangerous turns: 6,8,9.\n\nAt turn6: we must be at y6 in {0,1} (safe from freeway collision in the dangerous set).\n\nAt turn8: y8 not in {7,8} -> so y8 in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9}? But we are climbing, so probably not 9 yet.\n\nSimilarly, turn9: y9 not in {7,8}.\n\nWe start at y4=1.\n\nWe have 8 up moves and 1 stay in 9 actions.\n\nWe need to use the stay somewhere.\n\nThe stay can be used to avoid being at a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=2 at turn5, and we want to avoid being at y=2 at turn6 (which is dangerous), we could stay at turn5? But then we would be at y=2 at turn6 -> still dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=1 at turn5 and then at turn5 we choose U to go to y=2 at turn6 -> dangerous.\n\nThe only safe positions at turn6 are 0 and 1.\n\nSo we must be at 0 or 1 at turn6.\n\nHow to be at 1 at turn6 with minimal loss? \n   We can do: \n        turn4: S -> y5=1\n        turn5: S -> y6=1\n\nThat uses two stays? But we only have one stay available.\n\nAlternatively, \n        turn4: U -> y5=2\n        turn5: D -> y6=1\n\nThat uses one up and one down -> net 0, and we have used two actions to remain at 1.\n\nBut we have only one extra action (the stay) and we need to do 8 up moves, so total actions 9? \n   But we used two actions for the net 0, so we have 7 actions left for 7 up moves -> we get to y13=1+7=8, not 9.\n\nWe need 8 up moves, which require 8 actions. But we have one extra action (the stay) that doesn't gain. So total gain: 8.\n\nBut we start at 1, so we end at 9, but we need to do it in 9 actions.\n\nBut to be safe at turn6, we must either:\n\n   Option 1: at turn4: S -> then y5=1, then at turn5: we want to be at y6=1. We can do S at turn5 -> then y6=1. \n        Then we have 7 actions (turn6 to turn12) to gain 8? -> impossible.\n\n   Option 2: at turn4: U -> y5=2, then at turn5: D -> y6=1. \n        Then we have 7 actions to gain 8 -> impossible.\n\n   Option 3: at turn4: D -> y5=0, then at turn5: U -> y6=1.\n        Then 7 actions to gain 8 -> impossible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get to 9 in 9 actions (which would be 8 up moves and one extra move that is not up) and also avoid the collision at turn6.\n\nHence, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we can choose any path that achieves H=11.\n\nLet me pick the first one I thought of:\n\n   turn4: U\n   turn5: D\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: S\n\nBut we have 11 actions: from turn4 to turn14.\n\nNow, we must verify safety:\n\nAt turn4: y=1 -> freeway1: car at [-47,-36] -> safe.\nAt turn5: y=2 -> freeway2: \n        tail = -35+12*(5-4)= -23, head=-24+12=-12 -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\nAt turn6: y=1 -> freeway1: car at turn6: \n        tail = -47+3*(6-4)= -47+6=-41, head=-36+6=-30 -> 0 not in [-41,-30] -> safe.\nAt turn7: y=2 -> freeway2: \n        tail=-35+12*3= -35+36=1, head=-24+36=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? \n        But note: [1,12] includes 0? no, 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\nAt turn8: y=3 -> freeway3: \n        tail=-35+12*4= -35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> safe.\nAt turn9: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (similar to freeway3 at turn9: not covering 0)\nAt turn10: y=5 -> freeway5: safe\nAt turn11: y=6 -> freeway6: \n        first car: tail=-35+12*7=49, head=60 -> safe.\n        second car: tail=37+12*7=37+84=121, head=48+84=132 -> safe.\nAt turn12: y=7 -> freeway7: \n        first car: tail=-35+6*8= -35+48=13, head=24 -> safe.\n        second car: tail=13+6*8=13+48=61, head=24+48=72 -> safe.\nAt turn13: y=8 -> freeway8: \n        first car: tail=-35+6*9= -35+54=19, head=30 -> safe.\n        second car: tail=13+54=67, head=24+54=78 -> safe.\nAt turn14: we are at y=9, and we choose S. But at turn14, we are at freeway9? There is no freeway9, and the collision only checks freeways 1-8. So safe.\n\nTherefore, this path is safe.\n\nWe can write the actions:\n\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and t_1=4.\n\nThis matches.\n\nIs there a way with 11 actions that doesn't require the S at the end? \n\nWe could arrange to be at 9 at the last action without needing an extra S.\n\nBut the last action is at turn14, and we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn14. So we must choose an action. We can choose U or D, but that would move us away. So we choose S.\n\nAlternatively, if we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn13, then we would not need the extra action.\n\nBut to be at 9 at turn13, we need to gain 8 from y4=1 in 9 actions (turn4 to turn12).\n\nWe can do: 8 up moves and 1 stay, but we have to avoid the collisions.\n\nWe might use the stay at a non-dangerous time.\n\nFor example, we try to be at y6=1 without using a down move, but then we have to use two stays? \n\nBut we only have one extra action.\n\nWe might use the stay at a turn when we are not in danger.\n\nBut at turn6, we must be at y=0 or 1.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\n   turn4: U -> y5=2\n   turn5: D -> y6=1   [now we have used two moves to be at 1, net 0]\n   Then from turn6 to turn12: 7 moves: we need to gain 8 -> impossible.\n\n   turn4: S -> y5=1\n   turn5: S -> y6=1   [two stays, net 0]\n   then 7 moves to gain 8 -> impossible.\n\n   turn4: D -> y5=0\n   turn5: U -> y6=1   [net 0]\n   then 7 moves to gain 8 -> impossible.\n\nAlternatively, can we use the stay later? But we must be safe at turn6.\n\nWe have to be at 0 or 1 at turn6, and we start at 1. We can only get to 0 or 1 by using at least one non-up move in the first two moves.\n\nBut then we have only 7 moves for 8 gains.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to be at 9 by turn13.\n\nHence, the minimal H is 11.\n\nWe'll go with the above plan.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11, meaning the sequence consists of 11 actions from turn 4 to turn 14, and the player reaches (0, 9) at the beginning of turn 14 (i.e., \\(y_{14} = 9\\)).\n\n### Verification of Safety\n- **Turn 4 (y=1)**: Freeway 1 car span is \\([-47, -36]\\) at turn 4. 0 is not in \\([-47, -36]\\), so safe.\n- **Turn 5 (y=2)**: Freeway 2 car span is \\([-35 + 12 \\times (5-4) = -23, -24 + 12 \\times (5-4) = -12] = [-23, -12]\\). 0 is not in this interval, so safe.\n- **Turn 6 (y=1)**: Freeway 1 car span is \\([-47 + 3 \\times (6-4) = -41, -36 + 3 \\times (6-4) = -30] = [-41, -30]\\). 0 is not in this interval, so safe.\n- **Turn 7 (y=2)**: Freeway 2 car span is \\([-35 + 12 \\times (7-4) = 1, -24 + 12 \\times (7-4) = 12] = [1, 12]\\). 0 is not in \\([1, 12]\\), so safe.\n- **Turn 8 (y=3)**: Freeway 3 car span is \\([-35 + 12 \\times (8-4) = 13, -24 + 12 \\times (8-4) = 24] = [13, 24]\\). 0 is not in this interval, so safe.\n- **Turn 9 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 car span is \\([-35 + 12 \\times (9-4) = 25, -24 + 12 \\times (9-4) = 36] = [25, 36]\\). 0 is not in this interval, so safe.\n- **Turn 10 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 car span is \\([-35 + 12 \\times (10-4) = 37, -24 + 12 \\times (10-4) = 48] = [37, 48]\\). 0 is not in this interval, so safe.\n- **Turn 11 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 has two cars:\n  - First car: \\([-35 + 12 \\times (11-4) = 49, -24 + 12 \\times (11-4) = 60] = [49, 60]\\), 0 not in interval.\n  - Second car: \\([37 + 12 \\times (11-4) = 121, 48 + 12 \\times (11-4) = 132] = [121, 132]\\), 0 not in interval.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=5, and I start at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements because I need to avoid them when I'm on their freeway. The collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car's span includes 0. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not considered on it until the next turn, so I don't collide if the car is at 0 at the start of the turn when I arrive.\n\nLet me denote the turn number. Current turn is t=5, position y=2.\n\nI need to go from y=2 to y=9, so I need to move up 7 units. But I can also move down or stay, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help unless it avoids a car, but I should minimize turns, so probably I want to go up as much as possible.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S keeps it the same. y is between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nTo go from 2 to 9, the minimum number of moves without any obstacles would be 7 Up moves, so H=7 turns.\n\nBut there are cars on the freeways, so I might need to wait or go around, but since I can only move vertically, and the freeways are horizontal, I think \"going around\" isn't possible; I just have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but the player only moves vertically at x=0, and cars move horizontally on their freeways. So the player's path is only at x=0, moving up or down the y-axis.\n\nSo for each freeway y from 1 to 8, there are cars moving left or right, and I need to not be on that y-level when a car's span includes x=0.\n\nThe collision is defined: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn, I collide.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. But during turn T, I am on y_T, so I can collide only if on y_T and car span includes 0 at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nIn the note, it says: if I move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1 if I'm still there or something.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, when I am at position, I am on y_T for that turn. After I move, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe state at turn T is defined by y_T, and the car positions at turn T.\n\nWhen I take action a_T at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and car spans at turn T on freeway y_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, y_{T+1} and car spans at turn T+1 on freeway y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nNow, for the cars, I need to compute their positions at each future turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t=5.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with initial positions at t=5.\n\nLet me list all cars at t=5.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-33, tail tau=-44, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nSince direction is right, and span is given as (h, tau) = (-33, -44). But for right-moving, head is at h, tail at tau, and since it's moving right, head is to the right, so if h=-33 and tau=-44, that means tau < h, since -44 < -33, so tail at -44, head at -33, so span is from -44 to -33.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving, it says: span(t1) = [tau, h] then at T, [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, tau] to [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: car is right-moving, so span at t=5: [tau, h] = [-44, -33]? No.\n\nThe input says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [tau, h] if I read correctly.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), tau - s (T-t1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, span is [tau, h] with tau < h, I assume, since head is at h.\n\nIn freeway 1: head h=-33, tail tau=-44, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction right, and tau=-44, h=-33, so tau < h, so span at t=5 is [tau, h] = [-44, -33]\n\nThen at turn T, span is [-44 + 3(T-5), -33 + 3(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSo head h=-12, tail tau=-23, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSpan at t=5: [tau, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 12(T-5), -12 + 12(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-12, -23, right, 12) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-12, -23, right, 12) same.\n\nFreeway 5: same (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: first (-12, -23, right, 12) and second (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, [ -23, -12 ] at t=5.\n\nSecond car: head h=60, tail tau=49, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince right, span [tau, h] = [49, 60] at t=5.\n\nAt T: [49 + 12(T-5), 60 + 12(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: first (-18, -29, right, 6) and second (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: h=-18, tau=-29, right, s=6, span [ -29, -18 ] at t=5.\n\nAt T: [ -29 + 6(T-5), -18 + 6(T-5) ]\n\nSecond car: h=30, tau=19, right, s=6, span [19, 30] at t=5.\n\nAt T: [19 + 6(T-5), 30 + 6(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-18, -29, right, 6) and (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nNow, I am at y=2 at t=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=2, and freeways are 1 to 8, I need to go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=9 is the target, and freeways are from 1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, so no cars there.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at (0,2), which is not a freeway? y=2 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8? The problem says \"freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nBut at y=2, which is a freeway, I am at (0,2) at turn t=5, so I could collide if a car is at 0 on freeway 2 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nNow, let's check for each freeway at t=5 if there is a car at 0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: span [-44, -33] at t=5, 0 not in [-44,-33], so safe.\n\nFreeway 2: span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4,5 same, safe.\n\nFreeway 6: first car [-23,-12], 0 not in; second car [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 7: first [-29,-18], 0 not in; second [19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 same.\n\nSo at t=5, on y=2, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I want to minimize turns, I should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nI need to be on each freeway only when no car is at 0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find times when it is safe to be there, i.e., no car span contains 0.\n\nThen I can plan a path through safe times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway y, the times t when 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nt here is global turn, starting from t=5.\n\nLet Δt = t - 5, so at t=5, Δt=0.\n\nFor each freeway, compute the span at time t.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, one car, right-moving, s=3.\n\nSpan at t: [ -44 + 3(Δt), -33 + 3(Δt) ] where Δt = t - 5\n\n0 in span if -44 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -33 + 3Δt\n\nWhich is -44 + 3Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -33 + 3Δt\n\nSo 3Δt <= 44 => Δt <= 44/3 ≈ 14.666, so Δt <= 14 since integer? t integer, I assume turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSo Δt integer.\n\n3Δt <= 44 => Δt <= 14 (since 3*14=42<=44, 3*15=45>44)\n\nAnd 0 <= -33 + 3Δt => 3Δt >= 33 => Δt >= 11\n\nSo for Δt >=11 and Δt <=14, 0 in span.\n\nSpecifically, Δt=11,12,13,14.\n\nFor Δt=11: span [-44+33, -33+33] = [-11, 0], so 0 in span.\n\nΔt=12: [-44+36, -33+36] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=13: [-44+39, -33+39] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=14: [-44+42, -33+42] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=15: [-44+45, -33+45] = [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, not in [1,12], so not in.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt<11 or >14, not in.\n\nSo unsafe when Δt=11,12,13,14, i.e., t=16 to 19? t=5 + Δt.\n\nt=5+11=16 to 5+14=19.\n\nΔt=11, t=16; Δt=12,t=17; Δt=13,t=18; Δt=14,t=19.\n\nUnsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, one car, right, s=12.\n\nSpan at t: [ -23 + 12(Δt), -12 + 12(Δt) ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12Δt <=0 <= -12 +12Δt\n\nSo -23+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=23 => Δt <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so Δt <=1\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +12Δt => 12Δt >=12 => Δt >=1\n\nSo for Δt=1, 0 in span.\n\nΔt=1: span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor Δt=0: [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only unsafe at Δt=1, i.e., t=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car? But freeway 3 has its own car, but same parameters, so same: unsafe only at t=6.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at t=6.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at t=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6, two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, span [ -23 +12(Δt), -12 +12(Δt) ], unsafe at Δt=1, t=6.\n\nSecond car: head 60, tail 49, right, s=12, span [49 +12(Δt), 60 +12(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if 49 +12Δt <=0 <=60 +12Δt? But 49+12Δt, for Δt>=0, this is positive, since min at Δt=0 is 49>0, so 0 not <=49+12Δt? 49+12Δt >=49>0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in [49+12Δt, 60+12Δt] for any t, since min is 49>0.\n\nSo second car never has 0 in span.\n\nTherefore for freeway 6, only the first car matters, unsafe when first car has 0 in span, i.e., at t=6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7: y=7, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-18,-29,right,6) so at t=5, span [tau,h] = [-29,-18]? h=-18, tau=-29, so [tau,h] = [-29,-18]\n\nAt T: [ -29 +6(Δt), -18 +6(Δt) ]\n\n0 in span if -29 +6Δt <=0 <= -18 +6Δt\n\n-29+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=29 => Δt <= 29/6 ≈4.833, so Δt <=4\n\n0 <= -18 +6Δt => 6Δt >=18 => Δt >=3\n\nSo for Δt=3 and 4.\n\nΔt=3: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=4: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=5: [-29+30, -18+30] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at Δt=3,4, t=8,9.\n\nt=5+3=8, t=5+4=9.\n\nSecond car: (30,19,right,6) span [19,30] at t=5, at T [19+6(Δt), 30+6(Δt)]\n\nMin 19>0, so never contains 0.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7, unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 at t=5 to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum 7 moves to go from 2 to 9, all up.\n\nBut I might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nSince I start at y=2, which is a freeway, but at t=5 it is safe, as we saw.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so I can be there anytime, no collision.\n\nBut I need to reach it, so I must be at y=9 at some turn after moving there.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: unsafe only t=6\n\ny=3: unsafe only t=6 (since same as y=2)\n\ny=4: unsafe only t=6\n\ny=5: unsafe only t=6\n\ny=6: unsafe only t=6 (from first car, second never unsafe)\n\ny=7: unsafe t=8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe t=8,9\n\nNow, I start at t=5, y=2.\n\nAt t=5, y=2 is safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are that at t=6, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all unsafe because each has a car at 0? Not exactly.\n\nAt t=6, for each freeway:\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=6\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=6\n\nSimilarly y=4,5,6 all unsafe at t=6.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at t=6? y=1 unsafe only later.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nNow, I am at y=2 at t=5.\n\nIf I stay or move, at t=6, I will be at some y.\n\nIf I am on y=2,3,4,5, or 6 at t=6, I collide because all are unsafe.\n\ny=2 to y=6 are unsafe at t=6.\n\ny=1 and y=7,8 are safe at t=6? y=7: at t=6, Δt=1, for y=7, unsafe only at t=8,9, so at t=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at t=6.\n\ny=1 safe at t=6.\n\nBut I need to be on a freeway.\n\nAt t=6, if I am on y=1, it is safe; on y=7 or 8, safe; on y=2 to 6, unsafe.\n\nNow, from y=2 at t=5, I can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at t=6, but y=3 is unsafe at t=6, so I collide.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at t=6, y=1 is safe at t=6.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at t=6, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=3, unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe action from t=5 is to go down to y=1 at t=6.\n\nActions at turn t determine y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t=5, I am at y=2.\n\nI choose action a_5, which sets y_6.\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5.\n\nIf a_5 = U, y_6 = 3\n\nIf D, y_6 = 1\n\nIf S, y_6 = 2\n\nAt t=6, I am on y_6, and if on a freeway, check collision.\n\ny=2 at t=6 is unsafe, so if y_6=2, collide.\n\ny=3 at t=6 unsafe, collide.\n\ny=1 at t=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSo to avoid collision at t=6, I must set y_6=1, so a_5 = D.\n\nThen at t=6, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, at t=6, y=1 is safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, I can choose action at t=6.\n\ny=1 at t=6.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at t=7.\n\nNow, what about y=2 at t=7?\n\ny=2: unsafe only at t=6, so at t=7, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nLet me list for each y, the safe times.\n\ny=1: unsafe t=16,17,18,19 → safe for t<=15 or t>=20? t=5 to infinity except 16-19.\n\nt=6 is safe, as we have.\n\nt=7: Δt=2, span [-44+6, -33+6] = [-38,-27], 0 not in, safe.\n\n...\n\nup to t=15: Δt=10, [-44+30, -33+30]=[-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nt=16: Δt=11, [-11,0], unsafe.\n\netc.\n\nBut for now, at t=6, y=1 safe.\n\nI can go up to y=2 at t=7.\n\ny=2 at t=7: Δt=2, span [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 to y=6 at t=7: all safe, since only unsafe at t=6.\n\ny=3: same as y=2, at t=7, Δt=2, span [ -23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=4,5,6.\n\ny=7 at t=7: Δt=2, for y=7 first car span [-29+12, -18+12]=[-17,-6], 0 not in; second car [19+12,30+12]=[31,42], 0 not in; so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe.\n\nNow, y=7 and 8 unsafe only at t=8,9.\n\nSo at t=7, all freeways safe.\n\nBack to action.\n\nAt t=6, I am at y=1.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=2 at t=7.\n\nOr stay at y=1, or go down, but down to y=0, but y=0 not freeway, always safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I want to minimize turns, going up is better.\n\nSo at t=6, I should go up to y=2 at t=7.\n\na_6 = U.\n\nThen at t=7, y=2, which is safe.\n\nNow at t=7, y=2.\n\nI can go up to y=3 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at t=8, y=3 is safe at t=8, since only unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5,6 safe at t=8.\n\nBut if I go to y=7 at t=8, it would be unsafe.\n\nBut I am at y=2 at t=7, so if I go up, I go to y=3 at t=8.\n\ny=3 at t=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut I need to pass through y=7 and y=8, which are unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 or y=8 only when not t=8 or t=9.\n\nThat means I should avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSince I am at t=7 at y=2, I can move up step by step.\n\nEach move takes one turn.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=3: at t=8, y=3\n\ny=3 to y=4: t=9, y=4\n\ny=4 to y=5: t=10, y=5\n\ny=5 to y=6: t=11, y=6\n\ny=6 to y=7: t=12, y=7\n\nBut at t=12, what about y=7?\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but t=12 is later.\n\nAt t=12, Δt=7 for freeway 7.\n\ny=7 car: first car span at t: [ -29 +6(Δt), -18 +6(Δt) ] Δt=t-5\n\nt=12, Δt=7, span [-29+42, -18+42]=[13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [19+42,30+42]=[61,72], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 same.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, when I reach y=7 at t=12, it is safe.\n\nBut I can go faster.\n\nFrom t=7, y=2, I can go directly to higher y, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=7, after k moves, I can be at y=2+k at t=7+k.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so at some t, y_t=9.\n\nSince y=9 is not freeway, no issue.\n\nThe constraining freeways are y=7 and y=8, unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nSo I must not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nThat means, for y=7, I can be there only at t <=7 or t>=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, at t=7, I am at y=2.\n\ny=2 at t=7 is safe.\n\nI can go to y=3 at t=8.\n\ny=3 at t=8: as above, safe, since y=3 unsafe only at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, I can be at y=3, which is fine.\n\nThen at t=8, if I go up to y=4 at t=9.\n\ny=4 at t=9: safe.\n\nThen at t=9, go up to y=5 at t=10.\n\ny=5 at t=10: safe.\n\nUp to y=6 at t=11: safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=12: as above, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=13: let's check y=8 at t=13.\n\nΔt=8, for y=8 first car span [-29+48, -18+48]=[19,30], 0 not in; second car [19+48,30+48]? t=13, Δt=8, [19+6*8,30+6*8]=[19+48,30+48]=[67,78], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=14.\n\ny=9 at t=14, not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, from start: at t=5, y=2, we go down to y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, y=1, go up to y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=2, go up to y=3 at t=8.\n\nt=8, y=3, go up to y=4 at t=9.\n\nt=9, y=4, go up to y=5 at t=10.\n\nt=10, y=5, go up to y=6 at t=11.\n\nt=11, y=6, go up to y=7 at t=12.\n\nt=12, y=7, go up to y=8 at t=13.\n\nt=13, y=8, go up to y=9 at t=14.\n\nNow, at t=14, y=9, reached.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=5 to t=14, that's 10 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart at t=5, position.\n\nAfter action at t=5, we have y at t=6.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y at t_{t1 + H}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, and at t=5+H, we reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nThat's 9 actions? List:\n\nTurn t=5: action a5, sets y6\n\nt=6: a6, sets y7\n\n...\n\nt=13: a13, sets y14\n\nWe want y14=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=13, y13=8, then a13=U, sets y14=9.\n\nSo actions from t=5 to t=13, that's 9 turns.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut we can do better? Earlier I thought minimum 7, but because of the t=6 issue, we had to go down to y=1.\n\nIs there a way to avoid that?\n\nAt t=5, y=2, we must go down to avoid collision at t=6 on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut could I go up? No, because if I go up to y=3 at t=6, y=3 unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, y=2 unsafe.\n\nOnly down to y=1.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=6.\n\nThen from y=1, I go up at t=6 to y=2 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=7, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow, from there, instead of going slowly, can I go faster to avoid the y=7,8 unsafe times?\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I could be at y=7 before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=7, I am at y=2 at t=7, so I need to increase y by 5, which takes at least 5 turns, so at t=12, y=7 as before.\n\nAt t=7, y=2, after k up moves, at t=7+k, y=2+k.\n\nSet y=2+k =7, so k=5, t=12.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=10, I need to be at y=7 at t=10, but from t=7 y=2, in 3 moves, I can be at y=5 at t=10, not y=7.\n\nCannot reach y=7 before t=8? t=8 is too early.\n\nt=8: at t=7 y=2, at t=8 I can be y=3, not 7.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 or 8 at t=7 or earlier or at t=10 or later.\n\nBut at t=7, I am at y=2, so I must pass through y=7 at some t>=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 later.\n\nIn the sequence, I go from y=2 to y=3 at t=8, etc., up to y=7 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=8, I am at y=3, which is fine, and t=9 at y=4, fine, since y=3 and 4 are safe at those times.\n\nThe only delay was from t=5 to t=6 going down.\n\nBut is there another way?\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe, but going down might not help.\n\nAt t=5, after going down to y=1 at t=6, at t=6 I am at y=1.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I could stay or go down, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo going up is better.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=6, I go to y=2 at t=7.\n\nNow, at t=7, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path must include y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at some points.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 must be avoided at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 at t=7, but I am at y=2 at t=7, not possible.\n\nOr at t=10 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, the earliest I can be at y=7 is t=7 + (7-2) = t=12, as before.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=13, y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut from t=7 to t=12 is 5 turns to go from y=2 to y=7? From t=7 to t=8: y=3; t=9: y=4; t=10: y=5; t=11: y=6; t=12: y=7; so yes.\n\nNow, but in this, at t=8, I am at y=3, which is not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nt=9 at y=4, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut H=9 actions: t=5 to t=13 inclusive? Actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 9 actions, reaching at t=14.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nStart: t=5, y=2\n\nAfter a5=D: y6=1\n\na6=U: y7=2\n\na7=U: y8=3\n\na8=U: y9=4\n\na9=U: y10=5\n\na10=U: y11=6\n\na11=U: y12=7\n\na12=U: y13=8\n\na13=U: y14=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=5: y=2, freeway 2, at t=5, car span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=6: y=1, freeway 1, car span at t=6: Δt=1, [-44+3, -33+3]=[-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=7: y=2, freeway 2, at t=7: Δt=2, [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=3, freeway 3, at t=8: similar to y=2, car span [ -23 +12*(3) , -12 +12*3 ]? Δt=t-5=3, span [ -23 +36, -12+36] = [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4, at t=9: Δt=4, [ -23 +48, -12+48] = [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=10: y=5, freeway 5, at t=10: Δt=5, [ -23 +60, -12+60] = [37,48], safe.\n\nt=11: y=6, freeway 6, at t=11: first car same, [ -23 +12*6, -12+12*6]? Δt=6, t=11, Δt=6, [ -23 +72, -12+72] = [49,60], 0 not in. Second car: at t=11, [49 +12*6, 60+12*6]? Δt=6, [49+72,60+72]=[121,132], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nt=12: y=7, freeway 7, at t=12: Δt=7, first car [ -29 +6*7, -18+6*7] = [-29+42, -18+42]=[13,24], 0 not in. Second car [19+42,30+42]=[61,72], safe.\n\nt=13: y=8, freeway 8, similar to y=7, at t=13: Δt=8, [ -29 +48, -18+48]=[19,30] for first car, [19+48,30+48]=[67,78] for second, safe.\n\nt=14: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nFor example, can I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=5, I go down to y=1 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, instead of going up, I stay at y=1 for one turn? But that would waste a turn, making H larger.\n\nFor example, if at t=6 I stay, y=1 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I go to y=2, etc., but then I reach later.\n\nSimilarly, worse.\n\nAt t=6, I go up to y=2 at t=7 as before.\n\nThen from t=7 y=2, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut to avoid the unsafe times, I have to go through the levels.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are unsafe only at t=8,9, and I am at y=2 at t=7, I cannot skip levels, so I must go through y=3,4,5,6 before y=7, each taking a turn.\n\nSo from y=2 to y=7, minimum 5 turns: t=8 y=3, t=9 y=4, t=10 y=5, t=11 y=6, t=12 y=7.\n\nThen y=8 at t=13, y=9 at t=14.\n\nSo no faster way.\n\nBut earlier at t=6, I am at y=1, and if I could go directly to a higher y, but I can't, only one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps go down to y=0 at some point, but y=0 is safe, but going down then up takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=1, if I go down to y=0 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=1: freeway 1, at t=8: Δt=3, span [-44+9, -33+9]=[-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=9, etc.\n\nBut now I am at y=0 at t=7, then to y=1 at t=8, to y=2 at t=9, which is later than before, so I reach y=9 later, worse.\n\nSo not beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the sequence I have seems minimal.\n\nH=9 turns.\n\nBut let's count the actions: from t=5 to t=13, 9 actions.\n\nReach at t=14.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the sequence of actions starting from t_1, which is t=5.\n\nSo actions for turn 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nIn the sequence: a5=D, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I have to output for turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=5, H=9, so turns 5 to 13.\n\nActions: turn 5: D, turn 6: U, turn 7: U, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: U.\n\nBut in the sequence, after a13=U, y14=9.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=8?\n\nSuppose I start at t=5 y=2, go down to y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, instead of going to y=2 at t=7, I go directly? No, I have to move step by step.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=6, to y=7 at t=10.\n\nAt t=6 y=1.\n\nAfter 4 moves: t=7 y=2? If all up.\n\nt=6: y=1\n\na6=U: y7=2\n\na7=U: y8=3\n\na8=U: y9=4\n\na9=U: y10=5\n\nSo at t=10, y=5, not 7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=10, I need to be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nBut from t=6 y=1, in 4 moves, I can reach y=1+4=5 at t=10.\n\nCannot reach y=7.\n\nMinimum to go from y=1 to y=7 is 6 moves: y1 to y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, so 6 actions, from t=6 to t=11, y at t=12.\n\nt=6: start position, after a6, y7.\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=6 + k.\n\nSet y=7 at t=6+k, so k=6, t=12, y=7.\n\nSimilarly, as before.\n\nIf I start from t=5, after going down, at t=6 y=1, then to y=7 at t=12.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=13, y=9 at t=14.\n\nH=9 actions from t=5 to t=13.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster through the lower levels.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, since y=3 and y=4 are safe, no need to avoid them.\n\nAnother thought: at t=9, I could be at y=5 or something.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=9, I am at y=4.\n\nBut if I could be higher, but I can't.\n\nSuppose at t=5, I go down to y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, I go up to y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=2, I go up to y=3 at t=8.\n\nNow at t=8, y=3, instead of going to y=4 at t=9, I could stay or something, but that would delay.\n\nNot better.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=8,9, but I am not there, so fine.\n\nI think 9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nIn freeway 6, there is a second car, but it never affects, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by moving down at some point to avoid, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: at t=5, if I stay at y=2, but at t=6 y=2 is unsafe, so I must not be on y=2 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on any y=2 to6 at t=6.\n\nSo the only safe place at t=6 is y=1 or y=7 or y=8 or y=0 or y=9, but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, always safe.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 safe.\n\nBut I am at y=2, so I can go down to y=1 or to y=0? y=0 is below.\n\ny=0 is an option.\n\nAt t=5, y=2, I can go down to y=1 or to y=0? Actions: U, D, S.\n\nD: down to y=1, since y=2-1=1.\n\ny=0 is below y=1.\n\nFrom y=2, D goes to y=1.\n\nTo go to y=0, I need to be at y=1 and go down.\n\nSo at t=5, from y=2, I can only go to y=1,2, or3 with U,D,S.\n\nS to y=2, U to y=3, D to y=1.\n\nNo direct to y=0.\n\nSo at t=5, only choices: y=1,2,3 for t=6.\n\nBut y=2 and y=3 unsafe at t=6, so only y=1 safe.\n\nSo must go to y=1 at t=6.\n\nNo choice.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is fixed.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have a5=D, then all U except the first D.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is a5\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a6\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere t_1=5, H=9, so up to turn 5+8=13? t_1 + H -1 =5+9-1=13.\n\nYes.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7: U to go from y=2 to y=3? Let's list the actions clearly.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn 5: a5 = D → y6 = 1\n\n- Turn 6: a6 = U → y7 = 2\n\n- Turn 7: a7 = U → y8 = 3\n\n- Turn 8: a8 = U → y9 = 4\n\n- Turn 9: a9 = U → y10 = 5\n\n- Turn 10: a10 = U → y11 = 6\n\n- Turn 11: a11 = U → y12 = 7\n\n- Turn 12: a12 = U → y13 = 8\n\n- Turn 13: a13 = U → y14 = 9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt should be in a box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 6, there is a second car, but we saw it doesn't affect.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 1, we have unsafe times, but in this path, I only visit y=1 at t=6, which is safe, and not later, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\). To reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for unsafe times on certain freeways.\n\n- At turn 5, being on freeway \\(y = 2\\) is safe, but all freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe at turn 6 due to cars spanning \\(x = 0\\). The only safe action is to move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6.\n- From turn 6 onwards, moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) is possible, but freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at turns 8 and 9. The player must avoid these freeways at those times.\n- Starting from \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6, the player moves up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 7. At turns 8 and 9, the player is on \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\), which are safe. The player continues moving up, reaching \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13, both safe times, and finally to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nThis sequence requires 9 turns (from turn 5 to turn 13) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14. No shorter sequence is possible due to the constraints:\n- The downward move at turn 5 is necessary to avoid collision at turn 6.\n- The unsafe times on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 8 and 9 require the player to be on lower freeways during those turns, delaying the ascent to \\(y = 7\\) until turn 12.\n\nThe actions are:\n- Turn 5: Move down (D) to avoid collision on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 6.\n- Turns 6 to 13: Move up (U) continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently.\n\nCollision checks confirm safety at all turns:\n- Turn 5: \\(y = 2\\), car span \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in span.\n- Turn 6: \\(y = 1\\), car span \\([-41, -30]\\), 0 not in span.\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 2\\), car span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 3\\), car span \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in span.\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 4\\), car span \\([25, 36]\\), 0 not in span.\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 5\\), car span \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in span.\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 6\\), car spans \\([49, 60]\\) and \\([121, 132]\\), 0 not in either span.\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 7\\), car spans \\([13, 24]\\) and \\([61, 72]\\), 0 not in either span.\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 8\\), car spans \\([19, 30]\\) and \\([67, 78]\\), 0 not in either span.\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 9\\), not a freeway, no collision possible.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns \\(H = 9\\), with the sequence of actions as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ } U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1-8.\n\nImportant: The collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y' at turn T, the player is only on freeway y at turn T (and then moves to y' at the next turn). So at turn T, we are on the current freeway y_T and we check the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are starting at y=1 at turn 6.\n\nWe have to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move vertically. We can only change by +1, -1, or 0 per turn, and we must stay within [0,9].\n\nGoal: Minimize the number of turns H to reach y=9.\n\nWe'll simulate the car positions at each future turn starting from t1=6.\n\nFirst, let's note the car information for each freeway (k=1 to 8). The cars are given for turn t1=6.\n\nFor each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction and the movement:\n\n- Left-moving: the car moves to the left (negative x direction) so the span [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? But note the example: for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the representation is:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3) -> but the direction is \"right\", so it's moving to the right. So the head is the front? For a right-moving car, the head is the leading part (to the right). So:\n\nRight-moving: the car moves to the right. At time T, the head becomes h + s*(T-t1) and tail becomes τ + s*(T-t1). But note the representation: for a right-moving car, the span is [τ, h] meaning the tail is at the left and head at the right? Actually, the table says:\n\nFor freeway 1: head=-30, tail=-41, direction=right. But if it's moving right, then the head should be the rightmost? But -30 is greater than -41, so the head is at -30 and tail at -41 (so the car spans from -41 to -30, which is 11 units long). Then when moving right, the entire car moves to the right. So at time T, the head becomes -30 + s*(T-t1) and tail becomes -41 + s*(T-t1).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, we would have head as the leftmost and tail as the rightmost? But in the given data, all cars in this state are right-moving? Let's check:\n\nFreeway 1: right\nFreeway 2: right\nFreeway 3: right\nFreeway 4: right\nFreeway 5: right\nFreeway 6: two cars, both right\nFreeway 7: two cars, both right\nFreeway 8: two cars, both right\n\nSo all cars are moving right.\n\nTherefore, for any car (with head h, tail τ, direction right, speed s) at turn t1=6, at turn T (>=6), the span becomes [τ + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)].\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T happens if the player is at freeway k at turn T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 6 at y=1. We are at freeway 1 at turn 6. We must check if there is a collision at turn 6 on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: (h=-30, τ=-41, right, s=3). At turn 6 (T=6), the span is [τ + s*(6-6), h + s*(6-6)] = [-41, -30]. 0 is not in [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nNow, we need to plan a path from y=1 at turn6 to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Since we are at y=1 and we need to go to y=9, we want to move up. But we must avoid collisions on freeways 2 to 8 when we are on them.\n\nWe must consider the future turns and the car movements.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn. Since we want minimal turns, we try to go up as much as possible, but we might have to wait (stay) to avoid a collision.\n\nWe start at turn6: y=1.\n\nWe are going to consider the next turns. We need to know the car positions at each future turn for each freeway.\n\nLet me precompute the car spans for each freeway for the next few turns (until we can reach 9).\n\nNote: The minimal H is at least 8 (since we are at 1 and need to get to 9, and we can only move one step per turn, so at least 8 moves of U). But we might have to wait (use S) or even go down? But going down would be counterproductive. So we try to go up unless there is a collision.\n\nBut note: we start at turn6 at y=1. We are going to simulate:\n\nTurn 6: at y=1 -> safe (as above).\n\nNow, we choose an action for turn6. We can choose U, D, or S. Since we want to go up, we choose U.\n\nBut we must check the next state: at turn7, we will be at y=2 (if we choose U at turn6). Then we are on freeway2 at turn7.\n\nWe must check freeway2 at turn7.\n\nFreeway2: one car: (h=0, τ=-11, right, s=12) at turn6.\n\nAt turn7 (T=7): the car moves: head = 0 + 12*(7-6) = 12, tail = -11 + 12 = 1. So span [1, 12]. Then 0 is not in [1,12]? But 0 is less than 1 -> not in. So safe? But wait: the car spans from 1 to 12? Then 0 is not in [1,12]. So safe.\n\nBut wait: the car at turn6 was at [τ=-11, h=0] -> so from -11 to 0. Then at turn7, it moves to [1,12]. So at turn7, freeway2: the car is from 1 to 12, so 0 is not covered -> safe.\n\nSo if we move up at turn6, at turn7 we are at y=2 and safe.\n\nNow at turn7: we are at y=2. We can choose U to go to y=3 at turn8.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn8? Because at turn8 we would be at y=3.\n\nFirst, we need to know the state of freeway3 at turn8.\n\nFreeway3 at turn6: (h=0, τ=-11, right, s=12)\n\nAt turn8 (T=8): head = 0 + 12*(8-6)=24, tail=-11+12*2=13. So span [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=3 at turn8.\n\nNow turn8: at y=3. We choose U -> y=4 at turn9.\n\nCheck freeway4 at turn9.\n\nFreeway4 at turn6: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt turn9 (T=9): head=0+12*3=36, tail=-11+36? wait: T-t1=3 -> tail=-11+12*3=25, head=0+36=36? Actually: head=0+12*3=36, tail=-11+12*3=25. So [25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn9: at y=4, choose U -> y=5 at turn10.\n\nCheck freeway5 at turn10.\n\nFreeway5: same as above: (0,-11,right,12) at turn6.\n\nAt turn10: T-t1=4 -> head=0+48=48, tail=-11+48=37 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n\nTurn10: at y=5, choose U -> y=6 at turn11.\n\nNow, freeway6 at turn11: we have two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) at turn6 -> at turn11: head=0+12*5=60, tail=-11+60=49 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) at turn6 -> at turn11: head=-48+12*5=12, tail=-59+60=1 -> so [1,12]. Then 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe at turn11 at y=6.\n\nTurn11: at y=6, we choose U -> y=7 at turn12.\n\nNow check freeway7 at turn12.\n\nFreeway7 has two cars at turn6:\n\nCar1: (-12,-23,right,6) -> at turn12: T-t1=6 -> head=-12+6*6=24, tail=-23+36=13 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nCar2: (36,25,right,6) -> head=36+36=72, tail=25+36=61 -> [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo safe at turn12 at y=7.\n\nTurn12: at y=7, choose U -> y=8 at turn13.\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn13.\n\nFreeway8: two cars at turn6:\n\nCar1: (-12,-23,right,6) -> at turn13: T-t1=7 -> head=-12+42=30, tail=-23+42=19 -> [19,30] -> safe.\n\nCar2: (36,25,right,6) -> head=36+42=78, tail=25+42=67 -> [67,78] -> safe.\n\nSo safe at turn13 at y=8.\n\nThen turn13: at y=8, we choose U -> y=9 at turn14.\n\nWe are at (0,9) at turn14. And we are done.\n\nBut note: when we are at y=9, we don't have to check freeway9? Because the freeways are from 1 to 8. The goal is to reach (0,9). And at turn14, we are at y=9 and we are not on any freeway (since freeways 1-8 are the ones with cars). So we don't check collision at freeway9? Actually, the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So at y=9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we can reach in H=8 turns? But note: we start at turn6 (t=0) and we take actions at turn6,7,...,13 (8 actions) and at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn6: U -> y=2 at turn7? Actually, the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t, then at turn t+1, the position is updated.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn6: we are at (0,1). We take action a6.\n\nAt turn7: we are at y = y6 + Δy6.\n\nSo:\n\n- Turn6: U -> at turn7: y=2.\n- Turn7: U -> at turn8: y=3.\n- Turn8: U -> at turn9: y=4.\n- Turn9: U -> at turn10: y=5.\n- Turn10: U -> at turn11: y=6.\n- Turn11: U -> at turn12: y=7.\n- Turn12: U -> at turn13: y=8.\n- Turn13: U -> at turn14: y=9.\n\nSo we need 8 actions, from turn6 to turn13.\n\nBut we must check every step for collision.\n\nWe have checked:\n\n- Turn6: at y=1 -> freeway1: safe (car at [-41,-30])\n- Turn7: at y=2 -> freeway2: car at [1,12] -> safe because we are at x=0 and the car is from 1 to 12 -> 0 not in [1,12].\n- Turn8: at y=3 -> freeway3: car at [13,24] -> safe.\n- Turn9: at y=4 -> freeway4: [25,36] -> safe.\n- Turn10: at y=5 -> freeway5: [37,48] -> safe.\n- Turn11: at y=6 -> freeway6: two cars: [49,60] and [1,12] -> both do not cover 0 -> safe.\n- Turn12: at y=7 -> freeway7: [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe.\n- Turn13: at y=8 -> freeway8: [19,30] and [67,78] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn11 at freeway6, the second car is at [1,12]. That means at x=1 to x=12, the car is present. We are at x=0, so 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the freeway6 at turn11:\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) at turn6: at turn11 (5 turns later): head=0+12*5=60, tail=-11+60=49 -> [49,60]\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) at turn6: head=-48+60=12, tail=-59+60=1 -> [1,12]\n\nSo yes, 0 is not in either.\n\nBut what about at turn7: freeway2: the car is at [1,12]. Similarly, safe.\n\nIs there any problem at turn7? We are at y=2 at turn7, and freeway2 has a car at [1,12]. Since we are at x=0, we are safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says collision occurs if 0 is in the span of any car. So as long as 0 is not in the span, we are safe.\n\nHowever, we must also note that we cannot be at a freeway that doesn't exist? But we are only going from y=1 to y=8, and then to y=9.\n\nBut wait: at turn6 we are at y=1, then we move to y=2 at turn7, etc.\n\nBut let me check freeway2 at turn7 again: the car is from 1 to 12. So if we were at x=1 at turn7, we would collide. But we are at x=0, so safe.\n\nBut what if a car covers 0? Then we would collide.\n\nNow, let's see if there is any car that covers 0 at any turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway at the turn we are on it.\n\nBut in our plan, we are moving up without stopping. So we are on each freeway for exactly one turn: at turn6: freeway1, turn7: freeway2, ..., turn13: freeway8.\n\nWe have checked each and they are safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn6, we are at freeway1: car at [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are not on them at that turn, so we don't care.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nBut is there a faster way? The minimal number of turns is 8 (because we need 8 moves up). So we cannot do it in less than 8 turns.\n\nBut we could consider moving faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So 8 turns is minimal.\n\nBut note: we are at turn6 and we are going to use turns 6 to 13 (8 actions) and at turn14 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so H actions. And after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn our case, we take H=8 actions: at t=0 (which is t1+0 = turn6) to t=7 (which is t1+7 = turn13). Then at the next turn (turn14), we are at (0,9). So that meets the condition.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Let me read:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nWait, the player update: after taking action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, we move to the next position at turn t+1.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (turn6) at (0,1). Then we take an action at turn6, and we are at a new position at turn7.\n\nWe take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want that at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut in our sequence:\n\nWe take actions at turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 (H=8 actions). Then at turn14 (which is t1+8) we are at (0,9). So we reach at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? Let me check the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait, that is critical.\n\nRead: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nThat means the position at the end of the last action (at the turn when we have just taken the last action) is 9? But note the update: the position is updated after the action.\n\nActually, the state y_t is at turn t. Then we take action a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the position after the last action is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat would imply that at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1), we are at position 9? But we are at position 9 only after the last action? \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- At turn t: we are at position y_t.\n- We take action a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t at turn t+1.\n\nThe problem says: we take actions from t=0 to H-1 (relative to t1), meaning:\n\nAt turn t1 (t=0): we take a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\n...\n\nAt turn t1+H-1: we take a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nThe condition is: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut that means at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1), we are already at 9? Then we don't need to move? That doesn't make sense because we start at 1.\n\nAlternatively, it might be a typo? Or I misread.\n\nCheck the problem: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut then the last action a_{t1+H-1} is taken when we are already at 9? Then why take an action?\n\nThat seems odd.\n\nPerhaps the sequence of actions leads to the state at turn t1+H-1 being 9.\n\nBut note: the state y_t is at the beginning of turn t? Or after the action?\n\nThe problem says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", so the state is updated at the next turn.\n\nWe start at turn t1 at position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1).\n\nAfter taking action a_{t1} at turn t1, we move to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence of actions is up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLook at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\", then \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\", ... up to the last action.\n\nAnd the condition is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But that turn is the last action turn.\n\nBut at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at some position, then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}, and then we move to a new position at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9. Then we can choose S (stay) and then at next turn we are still at 9. But we don't need to be at 9 at the next turn? The condition is only to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut that would mean we can get there earlier? For example, if we get to 9 at turn t1+7, then we take an action at turn t1+7 (which is the last action, H-1=7 so H=8) and we are at 9 at turn t1+7 (the beginning of the turn) and then we take an action (maybe S) and then we are at 9 at turn t1+8? But we don't care about turn t1+8.\n\nBut the condition is only that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nSo we can reach 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our current plan, we are at:\n\n- turn6: y=1\n- turn7: y=2\n- turn8: y=3\n- turn9: y=4\n- turn10: y=5\n- turn11: y=6\n- turn12: y=7\n- turn13: y=8\n- turn14: y=9\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn14. But we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSet t1=6. We want y_{6+H-1} = 9.\n\nIn our sequence, we are at 9 at turn14, so 6+H-1=14 -> H-1=8 -> H=9.\n\nBut that would require 9 actions? But we only have 8 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if we get to 9 earlier? But we start at 1 and need to go up 8 steps, so the earliest we can be at 9 is at turn14 (if we start at turn6 and move up every turn: at turn7:2, turn8:3, ..., turn14:9).\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn14. Therefore, we must have 6+H-1=14 -> H-1=8 -> H=9.\n\nBut then we need 9 actions? But the 9th action would be at turn14? But at turn14, we are already at 9? Then we take an action at turn14? But we don't need to.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut if we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn, but we are already at 9. Then we can choose S (stay) and then we remain at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the condition is only to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, so the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken while at 9.\n\nBut we need to get to 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nHow many moves? We start at turn6 at y=1. To be at y=9 at turn t, we need at least 8 moves up. The earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn6+8=14? But at turn14, we are at 9 only after the action at turn13. So at the beginning of turn14, we are at 9.\n\nBut the condition is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn14, then we set t1+H-1=14 -> 6+H-1=14 -> H-1=8 -> H=9.\n\nThen we need to take 9 actions? But the last action is at turn t1+8 = 14? And at the beginning of turn14, we are at 9, and we take an action (say S) and then at turn15 we are still at 9.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require us to be at 9 at turn15, only at turn14 (the beginning of turn14) we are at 9.\n\nBut how do we get to 9 at turn14? We start at turn6 at y=1. We need 8 up moves. So we take 8 actions: U at turns6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Then at turn14, we are at 9.\n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn14, so we have y_{14}=9. And we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. Set t1=6, so we want 6+H-1 = 14 -> H=9.\n\nBut then the sequence of actions must be of length H=9, from t=0 to 8 (relative to t1), i.e., actions at turns6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nBut at turn14, we are already at 9, so we take an action at turn14? But we don't need to move. We can take S.\n\nSo the sequence is 8 U's and then one S at the end? But that would be 9 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 earlier? No, because we start at 1 and we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, the condition might be that after H actions, we are at 9? But the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at turn14. Then H-1=8 (because 6+8=14) so H=9.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn6 to turn14? But that's 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to take an action at turn14 even though we are already at 9.\n\nBut that's what the problem requires.\n\nAlternatively, if we can be at 9 earlier, but we cannot.\n\nSo in our plan, we do:\n\n- Turn6: U -> at turn7: y=2\n- Turn7: U -> at turn8: y=3\n- Turn8: U -> at turn9: y=4\n- Turn9: U -> at turn10: y=5\n- Turn10: U -> at turn11: y=6\n- Turn11: U -> at turn12: y=7\n- Turn12: U -> at turn13: y=8\n- Turn13: U -> at turn14: y=9\n\nSo at turn14, we are at y=9. But we haven't taken an action at turn14 yet. The last action we took was at turn13.\n\nTo satisfy the condition that at turn14 (which is t1+8) we are at 9, we set t1+H-1=14 -> 6+H-1=14 -> H=9.\n\nThen the sequence must include an action at turn14. Since we are at 9 at the beginning of turn14, we can take S.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: S\n\nBut is that minimal? H=9. But we could have taken 8 actions and been at 9 at turn14? But then the sequence would be 8 actions, and y_{t1+7}=y13=8, which is not 9. So we need the 9th action to have y14=9 and also to have an action at turn14? But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9, meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So at turn14, we are at 9, so we set t1+H-1=14 -> H=9.\n\nBut note: the action at turn14 is taken when we are at 9, and we choose S, and then we remain at 9 at turn15, but we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9? But that seems artificial.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after the last action, we are at 9? But it explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me check the problem statement: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo y_{t} is the position at the beginning of turn t? Or after the action of turn t-1?\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo y_{t} is the position at the beginning of turn t.\n\nWe want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nWe start at turn t1: at y=1.\n\nWe want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe number of turns from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 is (t1+H-1) - t1 + 1 = H turns? But the positions change only by actions taken at each turn.\n\nThe position at turn t is determined by the actions taken from turn t1 to turn t-1.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we need to have taken enough actions.\n\nThe earliest we can be at 9 is at turn t1+8 (because we need 8 moves up). So turn t1+8 = 6+8=14.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at turn14, which is t1+8.\n\nSo t1+H-1 = 14 -> 6+H-1=14 -> H-1=8 -> H=9.\n\nSo H=9.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 = turn6 to turn14 (9 actions).\n\nThe first 8 actions are U, and the last action (at turn14) is S, because we are already at 9 and we don't need to move.\n\nBut is there a collision at turn14? At turn14, we are at y=9. But freeways are only 1-8, so we are not on any freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: S\n\nBut we must check that during the entire sequence, we don't have a collision at the freeways we are on.\n\nWe already checked from turn6 to turn13: safe.\n\nAt turn14: we are at y=9, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut at turn14, we are taking an action S, but we are not on a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nThe collision check is only when we are on freeway 1-8. At y=9, we are not on a freeway, so safe.\n\nSo this plan works.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 earlier? For example, at turn13? But to be at 9 at turn13, we would have to move up 8 steps in 7 actions? That's impossible because we start at 1 at turn6, so after 7 actions (at turn13), we can be at y=1+7=8 at best.\n\nThen at turn13, we are at 8. To be at 9 at turn14, we take U at turn13.\n\nBut we cannot be at 9 at turn13.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car movements: is there any car that would hit us if we follow this path?\n\nWe checked the path and it is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway6 at turn11: we are at y=6, and there is a car at [1,12]. We are at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 at turn7: car at [1,12], we are at x=0, safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn7, freeway2 has a car at [1,12]. But what about other cars? Only one car.\n\nBut in freeway6, at turn11, we have two cars: [49,60] and [1,12]. Both are safe.\n\nBut is there a car that appears at 0 at any turn we are on that freeway?\n\nFor example, consider freeway2: at turn6, the car is at [ -11, 0] (because at turn6: head=0, tail=-11). Then at turn6, we were on freeway1, so no collision on freeway2.\n\nAt turn7, the car moves to [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut what if we were at freeway2 at turn6? But we weren't.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway6: at turn6, the first car is at [ -11, 0], the second at [ -59, -48]. At turn6, we are on freeway1.\n\nAt turn7: first car: [1,12], second car: [-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36]? But we are at y=2 at turn7, not freeway6.\n\n...\n\nWe are only on each freeway at the turn we are scheduled.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check freeway1 at turn6: car at [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nFreeway2 at turn7: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway3 at turn8: [13,24] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at turn9: [25,36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn10: [37,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn11: [49,60] and [1,12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn12: [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn13: [19,30] and [67,78] -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn14: we are at y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, and the sequence is 8 U's and one S at the end.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H, and we have H=9.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in less than 9? No, because we must be at 9 at turn14, and we start at turn6 at 1, so we need 8 moves up, which takes 8 actions, and then we need to have the turn14 as t1+H-1, so H=9.\n\nAlternatively, if we could be at 9 at an earlier turn, but we cannot.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"current turn is t1=6\", and we need to output the actions starting from turn6.\n\nIn the sequence, the last turn is turn14, which is t1+8.\n\nBut H=9, so we have 9 actions.\n\nBut let me write it in the format.\n\nNote: the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut is there any issue with the cars? We assumed that we move up every turn. But what if at some turn we have to avoid a car by staying or even going down? In this case, it was safe.\n\nBut to be complete, let me check if at any of the freeways we are on, at the turn we are on, a car covers 0.\n\nWe did that.\n\nBut specifically, at turn6: freeway1: car from -41 to -30 -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn7: freeway2: car from 1 to 12 -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn8: freeway3: car from 13 to 24 -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn9: freeway4: 25 to 36 -> no.\n\nAt turn10: freeway5: 37 to 48 -> no.\n\nAt turn11: freeway6: two cars: 1 to 12 and 49 to 60 -> neither covers 0.\n\nAt turn12: freeway7: 13 to 24 and 61 to 72 -> no.\n\nAt turn13: freeway8: 19 to 30 and 67 to 78 -> no.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and the span of any car on that freeway covers \\(x = 0\\) at that exact turn.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) at turn 6.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), at least 8 upward moves (U) are required, as each U increases \\(y\\) by 1, and the distance is 8 units.\n- The earliest turn the player can reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 14, as:\n  - Turn 6: \\(y = 1\\)\n  - Turn 7: \\(y = 2\\) after U at turn 6\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 3\\) after U at turn 7\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 4\\) after U at turn 8\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 5\\) after U at turn 9\n  - Turn 11: \\(y = 6\\) after U at turn 10\n  - Turn 12: \\(y = 7\\) after U at turn 11\n  - Turn 13: \\(y = 8\\) after U at turn 12\n  - Turn 14: \\(y = 9\\) after U at turn 13\n- The condition requires \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\). With \\(t_1 = 6\\), \\(y_{6 + H - 1} = 9\\). At turn 14, \\(y = 9\\), so \\(6 + H - 1 = 14\\) gives \\(H = 9\\).\n- Thus, 9 actions are needed: 8 U actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14, and an additional S (stay) action at turn 14 to satisfy the sequence length \\(H = 9\\), as the player is already at \\(y = 9\\) and no move is needed.\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\nThe car positions are computed for each freeway at the relevant turns (when the player is on that freeway). All cars are right-moving, so at turn \\(T\\), a car with initial head \\(h\\), tail \\(\\tau\\), speed \\(s\\) at turn 6 has span \\([\\tau + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)]\\).\n\n- **Turn 6 (freeway 1):** Player at \\(y=1\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 7.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements because I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car that has its span including x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on the freeway y_T. And importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, I choose an action: U to go up, D to go down, S to stay. Then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S. And y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nI start at y=2 at turn t₁=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1, 0, or +1 per turn, the minimum number of turns to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 turns if I go up every time, but I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut I should aim for the shortest path, so I'll try to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t₁=7.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-27, tail τ=-38, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, direction right means it's moving to the right? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: span moves right, so head increases? Let's read carefully.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn this notation, for left-moving, head is h, tail is τ, and since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut in the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ], but if it's moving left, h should be the front? I think I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nPerhaps head is always the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor left-moving, front is left, so as it moves left, both head and tail decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, front is right, so as it moves right, both head and tail increase.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, it's right-moving.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]? Let's see the rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, it says for freeway 1: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) = (-27, -38, right, 3)\n\nBut in the span notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so here τ = -38, h = -27? The car is given as (h, τ, d, s), but in the span, it's [τ, h] for right-moving? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read the car state carefully.\n\nThe table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -27, tail τ = -38, direction right, speed 3.\n\nNow for right-moving, the span at t₁ is [τ, h]? According to the update rule.\n\nThe rule says: for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut in this case, at t₁, τ = -38, h = -27, so Span(t₁) = [-38, -27]\n\nAs T increases, τ + s(T-t₁) and h + s(T-t₁), since s=3, both increase, so the car moves right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, when I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that I am on a freeway only when y between 1 and 8; y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars there, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the edges, no cars, so I don't need to worry about collisions when on y=0 or y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, so when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at turn 7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, so once I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nNow, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nt₁ = 7.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway possible.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span as a function of T.\n\nSet Δt = T - t₁ = T - 7.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car with 0 in Span(T).\n\nSince the span is a interval, I can find for each car when 0 is between the min and max of the span.\n\nFor simplicity, since the span is continuous, but we care about integer turns, so I can compute for each T if 0 is covered.\n\nBut T is turn number, discrete.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: head h=-27, tail τ=-38, direction right, speed 3.\n\nRight-moving, so Span(T) = [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)] = [-38 + 3(T-7), -27 + 3(T-7)]\n\nSet u = T-7, so Span(u) = [-38 + 3u, -27 + 3u]\n\n0 is in this interval if -38 + 3u ≤ 0 ≤ -27 + 3u\n\nSo -38 + 3u ≤ 0 ⇒ 3u ≤ 38 ⇒ u ≤ 38/3 ≈ 12.666, so u ≤ 12 since integer\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -27 + 3u ⇒ 27 ≤ 3u ⇒ u ≥ 9\n\nSo u ≥ 9 and u ≤ 12, so for u=9,10,11,12\n\nu = T-7, so T=16,17,18,19\n\nThus freeway 1 is occupied at x=0 at turns T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, freeway 2: one car: (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nHead h=12, tail τ=1, direction right, speed 12.\n\nRight-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)] = [1 + 12(T-7), 12 + 12(T-7)]\n\nSet u=T-7, Span(u) = [1 + 12u, 12 + 12u]\n\n0 in interval: 1 + 12u ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 12u\n\n1 + 12u ≤ 0 ⇒ 12u ≤ -1 ⇒ u ≤ -1/12, but u ≥0, so impossible since u = T-7 ≥0, 1+12u ≥1 >0, so 0 not ≤ 1+12u? Let's see:\n\nLower bound: 1 + 12u\n\nUpper bound: 12 + 12u\n\nSince u ≥0, lower bound ≥1 >0, so 0 < lower bound ≤ upper bound, so 0 not in [1+12u, 12+12u] for u≥0.\n\nThus, 0 never in span for freeway 2 car. So freeway 2 is never occupied at x=0 for T≥7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (12,1,right,12) same, so also never occupied at x=0.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (12,1,right,12), never occupied.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (12,1,right,12), never occupied.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) same as above, never occupied at x=0.\n\nSecond car: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed 12.\n\nRight-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)] = [-47 + 12(T-7), -36 + 12(T-7)]\n\nu=T-7, Span(u) = [-47 + 12u, -36 + 12u]\n\n0 in interval: -47 +12u ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12u\n\nFirst, -47 +12u ≤ 0 ⇒ 12u ≤ 47 ⇒ u ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so u ≤ 3\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -36 +12u ⇒ 36 ≤ 12u ⇒ u ≥ 3\n\nSo u=3, since u integer.\n\nu≥3 and u≤3, so u=3, T=7+3=10\n\nThus at T=10, 0 in span for this car.\n\nNow, for u=3, -47+12*3 = -47+36= -11 ≤0, and -36+36=0, so 0 ≤0, which is included, so yes, occupied at T=10.\n\nFor other u, not.\n\nSo freeway 6 has one car that occupies at T=10 only.\n\nBut the other car never, so overall, freeway 6 occupied at x=0 only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head h=-6, tail τ=-17, direction right, speed 6.\n\nRight-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)] = [-17 + 6(T-7), -6 + 6(T-7)]\n\nu=T-7, Span(u) = [-17 +6u, -6 +6u]\n\n0 in interval: -17+6u ≤ 0 ≤ -6+6u\n\nFirst: -17+6u ≤0 ⇒ 6u ≤17 ⇒ u ≤ 17/6 ≈2.833, u≤2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -6+6u ⇒ 6 ≤6u ⇒ u≥1\n\nSo u≥1 and u≤2, so u=1 or 2\n\nT=7+1=8 or T=7+2=9\n\nAt u=1: Span = [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nAt u=2: Span = [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (42,31,right,6)\n\nHead h=42, tail τ=31, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)] = [31 + 6(T-7), 42 + 6(T-7)] = [31+6u, 42+6u]\n\nu≥0, min is 31>0, so 0 not in [31+6u,42+6u], never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied only by first car at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6) same as freeway 7.\n\nFirst car: (-6,-17,right,6) same as above, so at u=1 and u=2, T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (42,31,right,6) never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when occupied at x=0:\n\nFreeway 1: T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: never\n\nFreeway 3: never\n\nFreeway 4: never\n\nFreeway 5: never\n\nFreeway 6: T=10\n\nFreeway 7: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 8: T=8,9\n\nI start at turn T=7, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path is from y=2 to y=9, and I must not be on a freeway when it is occupied at x=0 for that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, at turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nIf I choose to move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, I am on y=2.\n\ny=2 is a freeway, freeway 2.\n\nIs freeway 2 occupied at T=7?\n\nFrom above, freeway 2 is never occupied, so at T=7, on y=2, no collision, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, I need to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nThe minimum steps: from y=2 to y=9, I need to increase by 7, so if no cars, I could go up 7 times in 7 turns.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to wait or detour.\n\nSince I can only move one row per turn, and cars are only on rows 1-8, I need to pass through each row or skip some? No, I have to go through intermediate rows, since I can only change by -1,0,1 each turn.\n\nSo from y=2 to y=9, I must go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8 or stay, but eventually reach 9.\n\nThe rows I visit must be safe at the time I am there.\n\nNow, let's list the occupied times for each row:\n\nRow 1: occupied at T=16,17,18,19\n\nRow 2: never occupied\n\nRow 3: never occupied\n\nRow 4: never occupied\n\nRow 5: never occupied\n\nRow 6: occupied at T=10\n\nRow 7: occupied at T=8,9\n\nRow 8: occupied at T=8,9\n\nI start at T=7, y=2.\n\nAt T=7, y=2 is safe, as row 2 never occupied.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince rows 2,3,4,5 are never occupied, they are always safe, except row 6 has a problem at T=10, row 7 and 8 at T=8 and 9.\n\ny=6 is occupied only at T=10, so at other times it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 occupied at T=8 and T=9, so before and after, safe.\n\nNow, since rows 2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can be there anytime.\n\nThe critical points are when I am on row 6,7,8.\n\nI need to avoid being on row 6 at T=10.\n\nAvoid being on row 7 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nAvoid being on row 8 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nNow, I start at T=7, y=2.\n\nI want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at T=8, if I go up to y=3, or stay, or down, but down not useful.\n\nSince row 2,3,4,5 safe always, I can go up quickly to y=5 or something.\n\nBut I need to pass through row 6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nNow, row 7 and 8 are dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are soon.\n\nAt T=7, I am at y=2.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=3 at T=8.\n\nIf I stay, y=2 at T=8.\n\nIf down, to y=1 at T=8, but y=1 might be occupied later, but not soon.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nFirst, at T=8, row 7 and 8 are occupied, so if I am on row 7 or 8 at T=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nNow, at T=7, I am on y=2, safe.\n\nNow, suppose at T=7, I go up: so action U, then at T=8, y=3.\n\ny=3 is row 3, which is always safe, so no problem.\n\nAt T=8, I am on y=3.\n\nNow, at T=8, I can choose to go up to y=4 at T=9, or stay, etc.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at T=9.\n\ny=4 safe.\n\nThen at T=9, on y=4, I can go up to y=5 at T=10.\n\nNow at T=10, y=5, if I go up to y=6 at T=11.\n\nBut row 6 is occupied only at T=10, so at T=10, if I am on row 6, collision.\n\nBut in this sequence: at T=10, if I am on y=5, and I go up to y=6 at T=11, so at T=10, I am on y=5, not row 6, so safe.\n\nThen at T=11, I go to y=6.\n\nNow, row 6 is occupied only at T=10, so at T=11, it should be safe? Let's confirm.\n\nRow 6 occupied at T=10 only, as per earlier.\n\nAt T=11, not occupied, so y=6 safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=7 at T=12.\n\nNow, row 7 occupied at T=8 and T=9, but T=12 is later, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 occupied at T=8,9, so at T=12, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=8 at T=13, then to y=9 at T=14.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nStart T=7, y=2, action?\n\nI need to specify actions.\n\nAt T=7: I choose action for turn t=7, which affects y at T=8.\n\nAssume actions at turn t determine y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is new position.\n\nAt turn t, I am on row y_t, and I might collide if on freeway and occupied.\n\nThen after action, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row at that turn.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 7: at y=2, safe. I choose to go up, so a_{7} = U, then y_{8} = 3.\n\nTurn 8: at y=3, which is row 3, always safe. Now I choose action for turn 8.\n\nI can go up to y=4.\n\na_8 = U, then y_9 = 4.\n\nTurn 9: at y=4, safe. Choose a_9 = U, then y_{10} = 5.\n\nTurn 10: at y=5, safe. Choose a_{10} = U, then y_{11} = 6.\n\nNow at turn 11, y=6. Row 6: is it occupied? Only at T=10, not at T=11, so safe.\n\na_{11} = U, then y_{12} = 7.\n\nTurn 12: at y=7. Row 7 occupied at T=8,9 only, not T=12, safe.\n\na_{12} = U, then y_{13} = 8.\n\nTurn 13: at y=8. Row 8 occupied at T=8,9 only, not T=13, safe.\n\na_{13} = U, then y_{14} = 9.\n\nTurn 14: at y=9, which is not a freeway, safe, and I have reached.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=9, which is the goal, so I stop.\n\nThe sequence is from turn t=7 to turn t=13 for actions, and at turn t=14, I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=7 to t=13, that's 7 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions at turns: t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 7 actions.\n\nt=7 to t=13 inclusive is 7 turns.\n\nBut I start at t=7, after action at t=7, at t=8 I am at y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=13, at t=14 I am at y=9.\n\nSo H=7 turns, with actions at t=7 to t=13.\n\nBut is this possible? In terms of collisions, I think I avoided the dangerous times.\n\nAt turn 10, I was at y=5, not y=6, so no collision on row 6.\n\nRows 7 and 8 I was at T=12 and 13, not 8 or 9, so safe.\n\nAnd rows 2-5 always safe.\n\nBut what about row 1? I never went there, so no issue.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo this seems fine, and H=7.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nMinimum is 7 moves up, so 7 turns should be minimum.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach in fewer.\n\nSuppose I go up faster? From y=2, if I go up every turn, y=3 at t=8, y=4 at t=9, y=5 at t=10, y=6 at t=11, y=7 at t=12, y=8 at t=13, y=9 at t=14, same as above.\n\nAt t=10, if I were at y=6, it would be collision, but in this sequence I am at y=5 at t=10.\n\nCould I be at y=6 at another time? But row 6 only dangerous at t=10, so if I am at y=6 at t=9 or t=11, it should be safe.\n\nIn above, I am at y=6 at t=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 7 and 8, dangerous at t=8 and t=9, so I need to avoid being there at those times.\n\nIn my sequence, I am at row 7 at t=12, which is fine.\n\nBut could I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start at t=7, y=2.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, if I go up to y=4 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, if I go up to y=5 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, I am at y=5, as before.\n\nIf at t=10 I go up, to y=6 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, y=6 is safe.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, I need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut from y=5 at t=10, I go to y=6 at t=11, y=7 at t=12, y=8 at t=13, y=9 at t=14.\n\nThat's 7 turns.\n\nSuppose at t=7, I stay or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo 7 seems minimum.\n\nBut let me check row 7 and 8.\n\nRow 7 is occupied at t=8 and t=9.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on row 7 at t=12, which is fine.\n\nBut is row 7 safe before t=8?\n\nFor example, at t=7, row 7: what is the car position?\n\nFreeway 7 at t=7.\n\nu=0, T=7.\n\nFor the car on row 7: first car, Span(u=0) = [-17 +0, -6+0] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, second car not.\n\nBut at t=7, I am at y=2, not on row 7.\n\nCould I be on row 7 at t=7?\n\nBut at t=7, I start at y=2, so I need to move up.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=7, I need at least 5 moves, so at t=7, y=2, after 5 up moves, I would be at y=7 at t=12, as before.\n\nFor example, if I go up at t=7, to y=3 at t=8.\n\nt=8 up to y=4 at t=9.\n\nt=9 up to y=5 at t=10.\n\nt=10 up to y=6 at t=11.\n\nt=11 up to y=7 at t=12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I could be at y=7 earlier, but I can't, since min steps.\n\nAt t=7, y=2, so earliest to y=7 is t=12.\n\nSimilarly, to y=8 at t=13, y=9 at t=14.\n\nSo I think 7 turns is minimum.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I have actions from t=7 to t=13.\n\nt=7: U, to y=3 at t=8\n\nt=8: U, to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: U, to y=5 at t=10\n\nt=10: U, to y=6 at t=11\n\nt=11: U, to y=7 at t=12\n\nt=12: U, to y=8 at t=13\n\nt=13: U, to y=9 at t=14\n\nAnd at each turn, I was on safe rows.\n\nAt t=10, I was on y=5, row 5, which is never occupied, safe.\n\nAt t=11, y=6, row 6 not occupied at t=11, safe.\n\netc.\n\nBut row 6 is occupied only at t=10, which I avoided.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 and 8 occupied at t=8,9, I was not there.\n\nt=8: I was at y=3 or 4? In sequence, at t=8, I was at y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nt=9: at y=4, row 4, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if I need to consider the car on row 6 at other times? No, only t=10.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 has cars at t=16-19, but I'm not going there.\n\nBut I could go through row 1, but it would take more time, not useful.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=1 at some point, but y=1 is occupied at t=16-19, which is later, but if I go early, it might be safe, but unnecessary since rows 2-5 are safe always.\n\nIn this case, since rows 2-5 are always safe, and I can go directly up.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have to go through row 6,7,8, but I avoided the bad times.\n\nIs there a way to reach in 6 turns? That would require moving up 7 times in 6 turns, impossible since max +1 per turn.\n\nSo 7 is minimum.\n\nBut let me confirm the starting point.\n\nAt turn t=7, I am at (0,2), which is given.\n\nAfter H turns, I should be at (0,9), meaning after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\" or something?\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position should be (0,9) at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I apply a_t to get to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H - 1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd I start at y_{t_1} = 2.\n\nSo the change is from 2 to 9, delta 7, so with H actions, I need the sum of Δy to be +7.\n\nSince each |Δy| <=1, min H=7, with all Δy=+1.\n\nIf some Δy=0, H>7.\n\nSo min H=7 with all up moves.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I have all up moves, so it should work.\n\nBut in the sequence, at which turn am I at y=9?\n\nIn my actions: actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 7 actions, t from 7 to 13.\n\nAfter action at t=13, y_{14} =9.\n\nSo at turn t=14, I am at (0,9).\n\nt_1 + H = 7 + 7 =14, yes.\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I need to output the actions for each turn.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might have collision.\n\nFor example, at turn t=10, I am at y=5, which is freeway 5? Freeway k, y=k, I think.\n\nFreeway 5 is row 5.\n\nAt t=10, row 5: is it occupied? From above, row 5 never occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, y=6, row 6: at t=11, u=11-7=4, for row 6 car, we had u=3 for occupation, u=4 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=12, y=7, row 7: occupied at u=1,2 i.e. t=8,9, u=12-7=5, not, so safe.\n\nt=13, y=8, row 8: same.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at t=14.\n\nBut is there an issue with row 7 or 8 at other times?\n\nFor example, could I be on row 7 at t=7?\n\nBut at t=7, I am at y=2, so I can't.\n\nIf I were to be on row 7 earlier, but I start from below.\n\nSuppose I go down to y=1 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if I go down, to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut y=1 is row 1, which is occupied at t=16-19, but at t=8, is it safe?\n\nRow 1: at t=8, u=8-7=1, for row 1 car, we had u>=9 and u<=12 for occupation.\n\nu=1 <9, so not occupied.\n\nSpan(u=1) for row 1: [-38+3*1, -27+3*1] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut going down to y=1 at t=8, then I need to go up to y=9, which takes more turns, since from y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, so H=8 or more, worse than 7.\n\nSo not useful.\n\nThus, the direct up path with 7 moves seems best.\n\nBut in the car list, for row 6,7,8, I think I covered.\n\nBut row 6 has two cars, but one never occupies, only the other at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn freeway 6, at t=10, it is occupied, so I should not be there.\n\nIn my sequence, I am not at t=10.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 6 at t=9 or t=11.\n\nBut in the up path, I pass at t=11, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, for row 7, I pass at t=12, after the danger time.\n\nBut could I pass row 7 before t=8?\n\nFor example, if I were at y=7 at t=7, but I start at y=2 at t=7, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think H=7 is achievable.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1 =7: action U\n\nThen turn t_1 +1 =8: action U\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=7, so t from 7 to 13.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\n}\n\nBut the turn labels: since t_1=7, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 10, I am at y=5, and I go up, to y=6 at t=11.\n\nBut row 6 is safe at t=11.\n\nIs there any reason I need to wait? For example, if row 6 were dangerous at t=11, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps for row 7.\n\nAnother thing: when I move between rows, the collision only happens if I am on the row at that turn, not during the move, as per note.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, since I am only on one row per turn, and I change row at the next turn, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose to move to y_{T+1}.\n\nIf y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, I don't collide because I am not on that row at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and if 0 in span at T+1, I collide.\n\nBut in my case, for row 6, at t=10, 0 in span, so if I were on row 6 at t=10, I collide.\n\nBut in my sequence, I am not on row 6 at t=10; at t=10 I am on row 5, and I go to row 6 at t=11, when it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's see if I can reach earlier by taking a different path, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps use stay actions to avoid, but in this case, I don't need to.\n\nFor example, if I had to be on row 6 at some time, I might need to wait, but here I can just go through later.\n\nSo H=7 with all up actions.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nBut the actions are for turns starting from t_1=7.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nWith H actions, up to turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo for H=7, from turn 7 to turn 13.\n\nActions: U for all.\n\nBut let me write:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, there is another car (12,1,right,12) which never occupies, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on a freeway row when a car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)\nThe cars on each freeway occupy \\(x = 0\\) at specific turns, based on their movement rules and initial state at \\(t_1 = 7\\):\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Occupied at turns 16, 17, 18, 19.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Occupied at turn 10.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Occupied at turns 8 and 9.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Occupied at turns 8 and 9.\n\nRows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in Minimal Turns\nThe player starts at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 7. To reach \\(y = 9\\), a minimum of 7 upward moves is required, as each move changes \\(y\\) by at most +1. The goal is to avoid being on freeway rows when they are occupied:\n- Avoid \\(y = 6\\) at turn 10.\n- Avoid \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 8 and 9.\n\nThe optimal sequence is to move upward (U) every turn, resulting in the following positions:\n- Turn 7: Start at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 is never occupied).\n- Turn 8: Move to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is never occupied; not on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turn 8).\n- Turn 9: Move to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 is never occupied; not on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9).\n- Turn 10: Move to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as freeway 5 is never occupied; not on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 10).\n- Turn 11: Move to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as freeway 6 is occupied only at turn 10, not at turn 11).\n- Turn 12: Move to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as freeway 7 is occupied only at turns 8 and 9, not at turn 12).\n- Turn 13: Move to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeway 8 is occupied only at turns 8 and 9, not at turn 13).\n- Turn 14: Reach \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no cars).\n\nThis sequence uses 7 turns (actions from turn 7 to turn 13) and reaches (0, 9) at turn 14. Any fewer turns would require moving upward faster than +1 per turn, which is impossible. Deviations (e.g., staying or moving down) would increase the number of turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 7\\) to \\(13\\), with \\(H = 7\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U\n}",

The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I'm starting at y=3 at turn t=8.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn. The collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars on the new row until I'm actually there.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, I choose an action: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). Then my position updates, and I must stay within y=0 to 9.\n\nThe car update: for each car, given its position at t1, I can find where it is at any future turn T.\n\nt1 is 8.\n\nLet me list all the cars per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-24, -35, right, 3) — since direction is right, head is at h= -24? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe car state is given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor left-moving: span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: span is [τ, h] and it moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? No.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nI think \"head\" and \"tail\" might be misleading. From the update, for right-moving, the span is from τ to h, with τ < h, I assume, since it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left, span from h to τ, with h > τ, moving left.\n\nIn freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nSince d=right, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24], and since it's right-moving, at time T, position is [ -35 + 3*(T-8), -24 + 3*(T-8) ]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (24,13, right,12) — (h,τ,d,s)=(24,13,right,12)\n\nd=right, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [13,24]? But τ=13, h=24, so [13,24], and at T, [13 + 12*(T-8), 24 + 12*(T-8)]\n\nBut 13 to 24 is 12 units? Length should be |h - τ| +1 or something, but for collision, we care if 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5 all same as 2? Freeway 2,3,4,5 each have one car: (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6) — (h,τ,d,s)\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,6) — d=right, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 + 6*(T-8), 0 + 6*(T-8) ] = [ -11 +6(T-8), 6(T-8) ]\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,6) — [37,48] at t1, at T [37 +6(T-8), 48 +6(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nNow, freeway 1 has one car: (-24,-35,right,3) → span [ -35, -24] at t1, at T [ -35 +3(T-8), -24 +3(T-8) ]\n\nI start at turn t=8, position y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars there, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no freeways.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways at y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nI start at y=3.\n\nNow, at each turn, I choose U, D, or S, and move accordingly, and I must avoid being on a freeway where for that freeway, at that turn, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nAlso, when I move, say from y to y+1, at turn T, I am on y at the beginning, so I check collision for y at turn T. After action, I go to y+1, but I am not on y+1 until turn T+1, so at turn T, I don't care about cars on y+1.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down or stay.\n\nThe collision is only checked at the turn when I am on that freeway.\n\nNow, I need min H, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, for each car, find the times T when 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at time T, if any car has 0 in span, then it's occupied, and I cannot be on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince multiple cars, if any car covers 0, it's bad.\n\nFor each freeway, I need the set of times T where 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nThen, when I am on a freeway at turn T, I need that for that (freeway, T), it is not occupied, meaning 0 not in any car span at T.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, t1=8.\n\nSet Δt = T - 8, so T = 8 + Δt, Δt >=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at T: [ -35 + 3*Δt, -24 + 3*Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 3Δt\n\nSo -35 + 3Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 3Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/3 ≈ 11.666, so Δt <= 11 since integer? T and Δt are integers, I assume turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so integer, Δt integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, all positions, but spans are real intervals? The head and tail are given as integers, and speed integer, so positions are integers, I think.\n\nh and τ are integers, s integer, so span at T is [low, high] with integer endpoints.\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor freeway 1 car: low = -35 + 3Δt, high = -24 + 3Δt\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high, i.e., -35 + 3Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 3Δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 11.666, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 3Δt => 24 <= 3Δt => Δt >= 8\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 11 inclusive.\n\nΔt=8: low = -35 + 24 = -11, high = -24 + 24 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included? 0 <= 0 yes, and -11 <=0, so yes, 0 is in.\n\nΔt=9: low=-35+27=-8, high=-24+27=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nΔt=10: low=-35+30=-5, high=-24+30=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=11: low=-35+33=-2, high=-24+33=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔt=12: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not <= high? 0 <=12 yes, but low=1>0, so 0 not >= low, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, Δt=7: low=-35+21=-14, high=-24+21=-3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied when Δt=8,9,10,11, i.e., T=16,17,18,19? t1=8, T=8+Δt, so T=16,17,18,19.\n\nΔt=8: T=8+8=16\n\nΔt=9: T=17\n\nΔt=10: T=18\n\nΔt=11: T=19\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at turns T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (24,13,right,12)\n\nd=right, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [13 + 12 Δt, 24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 13 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 13 + 12 Δt >=13 >0 for Δt>=0, so low >0, so 0 never <= low, since low >=13>0, so 0 not in span for any T. Similarly, high>0 always.\n\nSo freeway 2 is never occupied, since car is always to the right, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, one car (24,13,right,12), same thing, never occupied.\n\nFreeway 4: same, never occupied.\n\nFreeway 5: same, never occupied.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12) — (h,τ,d,s)=(-24,-35,right,12)\n\nd=right, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-35 + 12 Δt, -24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12 Δt <= 0 <= -24 +12 Δt\n\nFirst: -35 +12 Δt <=0 => 12 Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12 Δt => 24 <=12 Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only Δt=2.\n\nΔt=2: low = -35 + 24 = -11, high = -24 + 24 = 0, [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nOther Δt not.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only at Δt=2, T=10, the second car covers 0.\n\nFirst car never, so freeway 6 occupied only at T=10.\n\nT= t1 + Δt =8+2=10.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,6) — (h,τ,d,s)=(0,-11,right,6)\n\nd=right, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 6 Δt, 0 + 6 Δt] = [-11 +6 Δt, 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 +6 Δt <= 0 <= 6 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -11 +6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so Δt <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6 Δt, always true for Δt>=0 except Δt=0, but Δt=0: 6*0=0, 0<=0 true.\n\n0 <= 6 Δt, for Δt=0, 0<=0 true, but let's see.\n\nFirst inequality: -11 +6 Δt <=0\n\nFor Δt=0: -11 <=0 true\n\nBut 0 in [low, high] requires low <=0 and 0<=high.\n\nAt Δt=0: low = -11 +0 = -11, high=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in? 0<=0 yes, and -11<=0, so yes.\n\nΔt=1: low = -11 +6 = -5, high=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=2: low = -11 +12 =1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=0: [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=1: [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=2: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (48,37,right,6) — [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [37 + 6 Δt, 48 + 6 Δt]\n\nAlways low >=37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only the first car matters, occupied when Δt=0 and Δt=1, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8+0=8, T=8+1=9.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, two cars: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, first car: [ -11 +6 Δt, 6 Δt], occupied when Δt=0 and Δt=1, T=8 and T=9.\n\nSecond car never.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, the times when it is occupied (0 covered):\n\n- y=1: occupied T=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=2: never occupied\n\n- y=3: never occupied? Freeway 3 has car (24,13,right,12), which never covers 0, so y=3 never occupied.\n\ny=4 same, never.\n\ny=5 same, never.\n\ny=6: occupied only at T=10\n\ny=7: occupied T=8,9\n\ny=8: occupied T=8,9\n\nI start at turn T=8, position y=3.\n\nAt turn T=8, I am on y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 is never occupied, so at T=8, I am safe on y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), so I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe actions: I choose actions starting from turn t1=8.\n\nSequence a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_8, a_9, ..., up to when I reach y=9.\n\nAt turn T, after action, position y_{T+1}, but the turn is T, I perform action at turn T, then position updates to y_{T+1}.\n\nLet's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at t.\n\nAt time t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nThen I choose a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nNow, collision at turn t: if I am on a freeway y_t (which is between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, at turn t, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nWhen I move to y_{t+1}, I am not on y_{t+1} at turn t, only at turn t+1.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=8, y_8 = 3.\n\ny=3 is freeway, but never occupied, so at t=8, I am safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, so when I am at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut I need to get there.\n\nMinimal turns: since I start at y=3, need to go to y=9, that's 6 steps up, but I can move diagonally? No, each action changes y by at most 1, so min steps is 6, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more.\n\nFirst, can I go up directly?\n\nStart at t=8, y=3.\n\nAction at t=8: if I go U, then y_9 = 4.\n\nThen at t=9, I am on y=4.\n\nThen if U, y_10=5, and so on.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn where I am, if it's safe.\n\nFirst, at t=8: I am on y=3, which is safe, as never occupied.\n\nNow, after action at t=8, I go to y_9.\n\nIf I choose U at t=8, then y_9 = 4.\n\nAt turn t=9, I am on y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway, never occupied, so safe.\n\nThen action at t=9: if U, y_10=5.\n\nAt t=10, on y=5, which is never occupied, safe.\n\nAction at t=10: U, y_11=6.\n\nAt t=11, on y=6.\n\nNow y=6: when is it occupied? Only at T=10.\n\nT=10: at turn 10, y=6 is occupied if I am there.\n\nt=11 is not T=10, so at t=11, y=6 should be safe, since only occupied at T=10.\n\ny=6 occupied only at T=10, so at other times safe.\n\nSo at t=11, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen action U, y_12=7.\n\nAt t=12, on y=7.\n\ny=7: occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nt=12 is later, not 8 or 9, so safe? T=12, Δt=12-8=4, for y=7, occupied only at Δt=0 and 1, T=8,9.\n\nT=12 not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, action U, y_13=8.\n\nAt t=13, on y=8.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=8 and T=9, not at t=13, so safe.\n\nThen action U, y_14=9.\n\nNow at turn t=14, I am on y=8? When I do action at t=13, U, then y_14=9.\n\nAt turn t=13, I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\nThen after action U, at turn t=14, I start at y=9.\n\nBut at turn t=14, I am on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I have reached y=9.\n\nThe position is (0,9), and since no cars on y=9, I am safe.\n\nIn this sequence, I went from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps: actions U,U,U,U,U,U from t=8 to t=13.\n\nt=8: action, then y_9=4\n\nt=9: action, y_10=5\n\nt=10: action, y_11=6\n\nt=11: action, y_12=7\n\nt=12: action, y_13=8\n\nt=13: action U, y_14=9\n\nAt turn t=14, I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=8 to t=13, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nBut at each turn, was I safe?\n\nAt t=8: on y=3, safe\n\nt=9: on y=4, safe\n\nt=10: on y=5, safe\n\nt=11: on y=6, but y=6 is occupied only at T=10, not at t=11, so safe.\n\nt=12: on y=7, occupied at T=8,9, not 12, safe.\n\nt=13: on y=8, occupied at T=8,9, not 13, safe.\n\nThen at t=14, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at t=14, after 6 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to when I reach.\n\nStarted at t=8, after H turns, I reach at t=8 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so turns t1 to t1 + H -1, and at turn t1 + H -1, I reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, after H actions, I am at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSet t_index.\n\nStart: turn t=8, position y_8=3.\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9 = position at turn 9.\n\nAfter a_9, y_10, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 at some y_T.\n\nThen at turn T, I am at y_T=9.\n\nThe last action was at turn T-1, which set y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=8 to t=T-1, and at turn T, I am at y_T=9.\n\nThe number of actions H = T - 8.\n\nBecause from t=8 to t=T-1, that's (T-1) - 8 + 1 = T - 8 actions? Indices.\n\nTurns: perform action at t=8,9,10,..., up to t=K, then y_{K+1} is position.\n\nSet y_{t1} = y_8 =3.\n\nAfter actions a_8, a_9, ..., a_{t1 + H-1}, then y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we have H actions.\n\nAt turn t, for t from t1 to t1+H-1, I am at y_t, and must be safe.\n\nAt turn t1+H, I am at y_{t1+H}=9, which is safe.\n\nIn this case, if I go up each time, at t=8, y=3\n\na_8=U, y_9=4\n\nt=9, y=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\nt=10, y=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\nt=11, y=6\n\na_11=U, y_12=7\n\nt=12, y=7\n\na_12=U, y_13=8\n\nt=13, y=8\n\na_13=U, y_14=9\n\nt=14, y=9 reached.\n\nH=6 actions: a8 to a13.\n\nNow, during t=8 to t=13, positions y_t: t=8:y3, t=9:y4, t=10:y5, t=11:y6, t=12:y7, t=13:y8.\n\nAll safe as above.\n\nBut at t=10, I am on y=5, which is safe.\n\ny=6 occupied at t=10, but at t=10, I am on y=5, not on y=6.\n\nAt t=10, position is y_10=5, since after a9=U at t=9, y10=5.\n\nAt turn t=10, I am on y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway, never occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, I am on y=6.\n\ny=6 is occupied only at T=10, which is turn 10, but at t=11, it is not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo this seems fine, H=6.\n\nBut is there a problem? y=7 and y=8 occupied at t=8 and t=9, but I am there at t=12 and t=13, which are later, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? But min is 6, since 6 steps up.\n\nUnless I can skip, but no, each step changes by at most 1.\n\nSo H=6 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: when I am on a row, and a car is moving, but since we computed the times when 0 is covered, it should be fine.\n\nBut in freeway 6, at T=10, it is occupied, but I am not on y=6 at t=10, I am on y=5 at t=10.\n\nAt t=11, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me check if at t=10, on y=5, is it safe? Yes.\n\nNow, but I start at t=8, y=3.\n\nt=8 is turn 8, and y=7 and y=8 are occupied at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, I am on y=3, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go up immediately.\n\nBut in this path, no problem.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? For example, if I need to avoid something.\n\nBut here, all rows above are safe except at specific times.\n\ny=1 has issues later, but I don't go to y=1.\n\nI go from 3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in less than 6? Impossible, since from 3 to 9, 6 steps.\n\nUnless I start at y=3, after 0 actions, but I need to reach y=9, so I must increase y by 6, each action at most +1, so min 6 actions.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, the actions: a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U.\n\nBut at t=13, action U, to y14=9.\n\nNow, the sequence should be for turns starting from t1=8.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, position y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is up to turn t1 + H -1, which is 8 + 6 -1 =13, yes.\n\nH=6, turns from 8 to 13.\n\nNow, but let me double-check if at any point I might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, at t=11, on y=6.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, cars.\n\nAt t=11, which is T=11, Δt=11-8=3.\n\nFor freeway 6:\n\nFirst car (24,13,right,12): at T=11, Δt=3, span [13+36, 24+36]? [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [13 + 12*3, 24 + 12*3] = [13+36=49, 24+36=60], [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (-24,-35,right,12): [ -35 +12*3, -24 +12*3] = [-35+36=1, -24+36=12], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo no car covers 0 at t=11, safe.\n\nAt t=12, on y=7.\n\nT=12, Δt=4.\n\nFreeway 7:\n\nFirst car (0,-11,right,6): span [ -11 +6*4, 6*4] = [-11+24=13, 24], [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=13, y=8.\n\nT=13, Δt=5.\n\nFreeway 8:\n\nFirst car: [ -11 +6*5, 6*5] = [-11+30=19, 30], [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=7 and y=8 occupied at t=8 and t=9, but I am not there then.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, at t=8, if I were on y=7 or 8, it would be bad, but I am on y=3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving immediately to higher rows, but I have to go step by step.\n\nAnother thing: what if I stay or move down to avoid, but here no need.\n\nBut let me see if at some point I must wait.\n\nFor example, if I were on y=7 at t=8, it would be occupied, but I am not.\n\nIn this case, all clear.\n\nBut in freeway 6, at t=10, occupied, but I am on y=5 at t=10, not on y=6.\n\nIf I had been on y=6 at t=10, it would be bad, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=6 is achievable.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 1, but I don't go there.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be minimal H.\n\nIs there a way with H<6? No.\n\nWith H=6, it works.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I try to go faster, impossible.\n\nOr slower, but H larger, not minimal.\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid something else, but no.\n\nAnother point: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and I can go to y=0, but that would be away from goal, so not useful.\n\nSimilarly, moving down not helpful.\n\nStaying might be needed if a row is occupied when I need to be there, but in this case, no issue.\n\nFor example, y=6 is occupied only at t=10, and I am there at t=11, fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with all actions U.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nFirst, H=6.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: U   (which is turn 8)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U   (turn 9)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 5: U   (turn 13)\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t1} = a8\n\nt=1: a9\n\n...\n\nt=5: a13\n\nSo turns: t_1 + t for t=0 to 5.\n\nIn answer: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} , Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}, ..., Turn t_1 + (H-1): a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H-1=5, so up to turn 8+5=13.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the box, it should be the actions.\n\nSince t1=8, we can write with numbers.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so probably with the turn numbers.\n\nIn the example, it might be symbolic, but here given t1=8, so use numbers.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, at t=10, occupied, but I am not there.\n\nBut suppose at some point I need to be on a row when it is occupied, I must avoid.\n\nBut here no.\n\nPerhaps for y=1, but I don't go.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 8 and must reach \\(y = 9\\), which requires a minimum of 6 upward moves (since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, and \\(\\Delta y = 9 - 3 = 6\\)).\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- The occupancy of each freeway (times when 0 is covered by a car) is determined based on the car states at \\(t_1 = 8\\):\n  - Freeway 1: Occupied at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (not relevant as the path does not use \\(y=1\\)).\n  - Freeway 2: Never occupied.\n  - Freeway 3: Never occupied.\n  - Freeway 4: Never occupied.\n  - Freeway 5: Never occupied.\n  - Freeway 6: Occupied only at turn 10.\n  - Freeway 7: Occupied at turns 8 and 9.\n  - Freeway 8: Occupied at turns 8 and 9.\n- The direct upward path from \\(y=3\\) to \\(y=9\\) over 6 turns (turns 8 to 13) avoids all occupied times:\n  - At turn 8: Player at \\(y=3\\) (safe, never occupied).\n  - At turn 9: Player at \\(y=4\\) (safe, never occupied).\n  - At turn 10: Player at \\(y=5\\) (safe, never occupied; freeway 6 occupied at turn 10 but player not on it).\n  - At turn 11: Player at \\(y=6\\) (safe; freeway 6 not occupied at turn 11).\n  - At turn 12: Player at \\(y=7\\) (safe; freeway 7 not occupied at turn 12).\n  - At turn 13: Player at \\(y=8\\) (safe; freeway 8 not occupied at turn 13).\n- At turn 14, the player reaches \\(y=9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\n### Minimal Sequence\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 6, with the sequence of actions all \"U\" (up) from turn 8 to turn 13. This sequence reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 14.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 8: U (player moves to \\(y=4\\) at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (player moves to \\(y=5\\) at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (player moves to \\(y=6\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (player moves to \\(y=7\\) at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: U (player moves to \\(y=8\\) at turn 13)\n- Turn 13: U (player moves to \\(y=9\\) at turn 14)\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t₁ = 9, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars defined by their head, tail, direction, and speed. Since the direction is given as \"right\" for all, that means they're moving to the right, so their positions increase over time.\n\nThe car update rule for right-moving cars is: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], where at time t₁, the span was [τ, h]. But in the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). For right-moving cars, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail? Let me check the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: head = -21, tail = -32, direction right. Since it's moving right, at time t₁=9, the car is from x= -32 to x= -21? But tail is -32, head is -21, so if head is the front and it's moving right, then yes, tail is left, head is right, so span is [tail, head] = [-32, -21].\n\nThe update says: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], so from τ to h, which is increasing.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at that turn, meaning y_T = k for some freeway k, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you are at position (0, y_T), and you decide to move to y_{T+1}, you are only on y_T at turn T, so you only check for collision on y_T at that turn. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, collision is checked only on the current freeway at the current time step.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9, so I need to move up. Each action U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays. y must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nSince I want to minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8; y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision possible on y=0 or y=9. So when I'm at y=0 or y=9, I'm safe.\n\nI start at (0,4), which is on freeway y=4, so at turn t₁=9, I need to check if there's a car on y=4 at x=0.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nAt time T=t₁=9, what is the span?\n\nThe car is defined at t₁, so Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [25, 36]? But it says (head h, tail τ), so for this one, head=36, tail=25, direction right.\n\nSo at t₁=9, span is [25, 36] for this car? But [25,36] is from x=25 to x=36, which doesn't include x=0, since 0 is not between 25 and 36. Similarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4 has only one car: (36,25,right,12), so span at t=9 is [25,36], not including 0. So at turn t₁=9, I'm at (0,4), and since no car at x=0 on y=4, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to take actions to move to y=9.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nSince I want to minimize H, the number of turns, I should always go up, but I have to make sure that when I'm on each freeway y=5,6,7,8, there is no car at x=0 at that time.\n\nI start at y=4 at t=9. After one action, at t=10, I can be at y=5,4, or3.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at t=10, then at turn t=10, I am on y=5, so I need to check freeway 5 at time t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or go down, but going down would be counterproductive since I need to go up to 9.\n\nSo probably, I should go up as much as possible, only deviating if necessary to avoid collision.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nt₁ = 9 is the current turn.\n\nFor any future turn T, T - t₁ = T - 9, let's call Δt = T - 9, so at turn T = 9 + Δt, the time elapsed is Δt.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail τ, speed s, direction right, at time T, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right-moving here.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at time T if 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for some car, min(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ + s Δt and h + s Δt, and since head > tail, h > τ, so span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], and 0 in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] iff τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all right here.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: head h=-21, tail τ=-32, speed s=3, direction right.\n\nAt time T=9+Δt, span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-32 + 3 Δt, -21 + 3 Δt]\n\n0 in this interval if -32 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -21 + 3 Δt\n\nSolve:\n\n-32 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3 Δt ≤ 32 ⇒ Δt ≤ 32/3 ≈ 10.666, so Δt ≤ 10 since integer? Δt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = T - t₁, integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -21 + 3 Δt ⇒ 21 ≤ 3 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 7\n\nSo for Δt from 7 to 10 inclusive? Let's see:\n\nIf Δt=7: -32 + 21 = -11 ≤ 0, and -21 + 21 = 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included since ≤.\n\n0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=8: -32+24= -8 ≤0, -21+24=3 ≥0? 0 ≤3 true.\n\nΔt=9: -32+27= -5≤0, -21+27=6≥0, true.\n\nΔt=10: -32+30= -2≤0, -21+30=9≥0, true.\n\nΔt=11: -32+33=1>0, not ≤0, and -21+33=12>0, so 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nSimilarly, lower: Δt=6: -32+18= -14≤0, but -21+18= -3 ≤0? 0 ≤ -3? False, 0 not ≤ -3, so 0 not in [-14,-3], since -3 <0.\n\nSo only for Δt=7,8,9,10.\n\nAt T=9+7=16, 17,18,19? Δt=7: T=16, etc.\n\nBut we are at t=9 now, so for freeway 1, collision at T=16,17,18,19 if on y=1 at those times.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: (36,25,right,12)\n\nOnly one car? Table says \"Cars\" but only one entry, so probably one car.\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 2: head=36, tail=25, speed=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 12 Δt, 36 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in this? 25 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 36 +12 Δt\n\n25 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ -25, impossible since Δt ≥0, 12 Δt ≥0, 25>0, so never ≤0. Similarly, min is 25+12Δt >0 for all Δt≥0, so 0 never in the span. Safe all time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head=36, tail=25, speed=12, right. Same as freeway 2, so also safe, no collision possible.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (36,25,right,12), same as above, safe.\n\nFreeway 5: (36,25,right,12), same, safe.\n\nAll these have min x=25 at t=9, moving right, so always x≥25>0, never at 0. Safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: has two cars? \" (36, 25, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12) \"\n\nSo two cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) same as before, min=25>0, safe.\n\nSecond car: head=-12, tail=-23, speed=12, right.\n\nSpan: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 12 Δt, -12 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in this if -23 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12 Δt\n\nLeft: -23 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so Δt ≤1\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -12 +12 Δt ⇒ 12 ≤ 12 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥1\n\nSo for Δt=1: -23+12= -11 ≤0, and -12+12=0 ≤0, true.\n\nΔt=0: at t₁, Δt=0, -23 +0= -23 ≤0? -23≤0 true, but 0 ≤ -12? 0 ≤ -12 false, so not in [-23,-12] since all negative.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=2: -23+24=1>0, not ≤0, and -12+24=12>0, so not in [1,12], no.\n\nSo only at Δt=1, T= t₁ +1 =10, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nSo on freeway 6, collision at T=10 only if on y=6 at that time.\n\nNow freeway 7: cars: (6, -5, right, 6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=6, tail=-5, speed=6, right.\n\nSpan: [-5 +6 Δt, 6 +6 Δt]\n\n0 in this if -5 +6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 6 +6 Δt\n\nLeft: -5 +6 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 Δt ≤ 5 ⇒ Δt ≤ 5/6 ≈0.833, so Δt ≤0\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 6 +6 Δt always true since Δt≥0.\n\nBut Δt≤0 and Δt≥0, so only Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0: -5 +0 = -5 ≤0, 6+0=6≥0, and 0 in between? -5 ≤0≤6 true.\n\nFor Δt=1: -5+6=1>0, not ≤0, so min=1>0, 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, Δt=0 only.\n\nSo collision at T= t₁ =9 only if on y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, we are at y=4, not 7, so ok.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (54,43,right,6), min=43>0, always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only collision risk at t=9, but we not on it then.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar, (6,-5,right,6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, collision at Δt=0 only, T=9.\n\nSecond car safe.\n\nSo no collision risk on freeway 8 except at t=9, which we avoid since not on it.\n\nNow, summarize collision times:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=16,17,18,19 (Δt=7,8,9,10)\n\n- Freeway 2: safe all time\n\n- Freeway 3: safe\n\n- Freeway 4: safe\n\n- Freeway 5: safe\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=10 (only)\n\n- Freeway 7: collision only at T=9\n\n- Freeway 8: collision only at T=9\n\nWe start at t=9, y=4.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=4, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from 1 to 8, so to go from y=4 to y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSince y=9 is not a freeway, we can be there safely.\n\nWe need to be on each freeway at some turn without collision.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up directly, but need to avoid being on y=6 at T=10, because on freeway 6, collision at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have no issues except y=1 at later times, but since we are going up, we won't be on y=1.\n\ny=1 is below, we start at 4, going to 9, so we won't go below, probably.\n\nBut we could, to avoid something, but since we need to go up, going down might cost more turns, so probably not optimal.\n\nFirst, direct path: go up each turn.\n\nStart at t=9, y=4.\n\nAction at t=9: if we go U, to y=5 at t=10.\n\nt=10, we are on y=5.\n\nIs y=5 safe at t=10? Freeway 5: we saw it's safe all time, since min x=25>0. So yes.\n\nThen at t=10, we can go U to y=6 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, if we are on y=6, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6 collision only at T=10, not at other times. At T=11, Δt=2, for the second car, span [ -23 +12*2, -12 +12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], min=1>0, no car at 0. First car also safe. So at T=11, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10, if we were on y=6, it would be collision, but we are going to y=6 at t=11, not at t=10.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=9: at y=4, action U, move to y=5 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10: we are on y=5, which is safe. Action U, move to y=6 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11: we are on y=6. At T=11, freeway 6: as above, no car at 0, safe. Action U to y=7 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12: on y=7. Freeway 7: collision only at T=9, which is past, so at t=12, Δt=3, span for first car: [-5 +6*3, 6+18] = [-5+18, 6+18] = [13,24], min=13>0, safe. Second car also safe. So safe. Action U to y=8 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13: on y=8. Freeway 8: similarly, at t=13, Δt=4, first car: [-5+24, 6+24]= [19,30]>0, safe. Action U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14: on y=9, which is not a freeway, safe. Done.\n\nWe reached y=9 at t=14, starting from t=9, so H=5 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nt=9: start, take action for next position.\n\nDefine the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, and we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn t₁=9, we are at (0,4).\n\nWe take action a_{9}, which will move us to y_{10}.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are at y_{10}, take a_{10}, move to y_{11}, and so on.\n\nWe reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, then we are done at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is when we reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if at turn T we are at y_T=8, and we take U, then at turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}=9.\n\nThen we have taken actions from t=9 to t=T.\n\nThe number of turns H is the number of actions, and after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nStart at t=9, after 0 actions, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=10, y= something.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=9+k, position y_{9+k}.\n\nWe want y_{9+H-1} =9? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at time t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at time t₁+1, position is updated.\n\nAfter all H actions, at time t₁ + H, position is y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H} =9? But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\"\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"minimizes H such that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the action sequence, after the last action a_{t₁ + H -1}, at turn (t₁ + H -1) +1 = t₁ + H, the position is updated to y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we want at turn t₁ + H -1, the position to be (0,9).\n\nAt turn t, the position is y_t, before taking action a_t.\n\nThen after taking a_t, it moves to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we take a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT should be t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have taken actions at t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1, so the last position update is at turn t₁+H-1, moving to y_{t₁+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, meaning that at turn t₁ + H -1, we are already at 9, so we don't need to move further.\n\nIn that case, at turn t₁ + H -1, we are at y=9, and we might not take an action, but the sequence includes actions up to when we reach.\n\nFrom the minimization, H is the number of actions to reach by turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=4 at t=9, and if we could stay, but we need to go to 9.\n\nSuppose at turn 9, we are at 4, take no action? But we have to take actions.\n\nThe actions start from t=9.\n\nIf we take action U at t=9, at t=10 we are at 5.\n\nIf we want to be at 9 at turn 10, that would require moving up 5 steps in one turn, impossible.\n\nMinimum turns: from y=4 to y=9, difference 5, so need at least 5 up actions, and since we can only move one per turn, minimum H=5 turns, and we reach at turn t=9+5=14, with y_{14}=9.\n\nIn the turn count: at turn 9, start y=4.\n\nAfter action 1 (a9), at t=10, y=?\n\nAfter action 2 (a10), at t=11, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter action 5 (a13), at t=14, y=?\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{9 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = t₁ + H -1 =9 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen actions are from t=9 to t=T-1? Let's see.\n\nActions a_t for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, position at t+1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nTake a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want at turn T, y_T=9, with T = t₁ + H -1.\n\nSince t₁=9, T=9 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, T=9+1-1=9, so we want y_9=9, but we start at y_9=4, not 9, so impossible for H=1.\n\nH=2, T=9+2-1=10, want y_10=9.\n\nBut from y_9=4, in one action, we can only go to 3,4, or5, not to9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=3, T=11, y_11=9, from y9=4, after two actions, max y=6, min=2, not 9.\n\nH=4, T=12, y12=9, after three actions from y9=4, max y=7, not 9.\n\nH=5, T=13? T=t₁ + H -1=9 + H -1.\n\nFor H=5, T=9+5-1=13, want y13=9.\n\nAfter four actions: actions at t=9,10,11,12, positions at t=10,11,12,13.\n\nStart y9=4.\n\nAfter a9, y10 = y9 + Δy\n\nAfter a10, y11 = y10 + Δy\n\nAfter a11, y12 = y11 + Δy\n\nAfter a12, y13 = y12 + Δy\n\nWe want y13=9.\n\nSince we can move up to +1 per action, to go from 4 to 9, need +5, so at least 5 up actions, but with H=5 actions, we have four intervals? Let's list the positions.\n\nAt turn t=9: y9=4\n\nAfter action a9: y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nAfter action a10: y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nAfter action a11: y12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nAfter action a12: y13 = y12 + Δy12\n\ny13 is after four actions? Actions from a9 to a12, that's four actions.\n\nFor H actions, actions at t= t₁ to t₁+H-1, so for H=5, actions at t=9,10,11,12,13? t from t₁ to t₁+H-1, so t=9 to 9+5-1=13? t₁ + H -1 =9+5-1=13, so actions a9 to a13? That's five actions.\n\nThen positions: after a9, y10; after a10, y11; ... after a13, y14.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{9+5-1} = y13 =9.\n\ny13 is the position at turn 13, which is after actions a9 to a12? Let's index carefully.\n\nDefine the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nTake action a_t, move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe action sequence is for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so a_{t₁}, a_{t₁+1}, ..., a_{t₁+H-1}.\n\nAfter taking these H actions, the position at time t₁ + H is y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t₁ + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat is, at turn T = t₁ + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nAt that turn, we have not yet taken the action for that turn, but since we are at y=9, we might take an action or not, but the sequence includes a_T, which might be S or something.\n\nSince we are at 9, and 9 is safe, we can just stay or whatever, but we need to be at 9 at that turn.\n\nIn terms of reaching, once y_T=9, we are done, and the actions up to a_{T-1} might have brought us there, or a_T could be S.\n\nFor example, if at turn T-1, we were at 8, and took U, then at turn T we are at 9.\n\nOr if at turn T, we are at 9, and take S, but we were already at 9.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y4 to y9, need to increase by 5, so minimum 5 up moves, and since each move changes y by at most 1, it takes at least 5 turns to reach from turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action (a9), at t=10, y<=5\n\nAfter 2 actions (a9,a10), at t=11, y<=6\n\nAfter 3, at t=12, y<=7\n\nAfter 4, at t=13, y<=8\n\nAfter 5 actions (a9 to a13), at t=14, y<=9\n\nWe can reach y9 at turn 14 with 5 up actions.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nFor y_T=9 with T= t₁ + H -1.\n\nt₁=9, so T=9 + H -1.\n\nSet y_T=9, with T as small as possible.\n\nSince y starts at 4 at t=9, and increases at most 1 per turn, the earliest T is when we go up every turn, so at t=10, y=5; t=11,y=6; t=12,y=7; t=13,y=8; t=14,y=9. So T=14.\n\nThen T=14=9 + H -1, so 14=8+H, thus H=6? Let's solve.\n\nT = t₁ + H -1 =9 + H -1\n\ny_T=9.\n\nT min is 14, so 9 + H -1 =14, so 8 + H =14, H=6.\n\nBut that can't be right because with 5 up actions we reach at t=14.\n\nAction at t=9: U, to y10=5\n\na10: U, to y11=6\n\na11: U, to y12=7\n\na12: U, to y13=8\n\na13: U, to y14=9\n\nSo actions at t=9,10,11,12,13: five actions.\n\nAt turn t=14, y14=9.\n\nWe want y_T=9 with T= t₁ + H -1.\n\nt₁=9, so T=9 + H -1.\n\nSet T=14, then 14=9 + H -1, so 14=8+H, H=6.\n\nBut we have only 5 actions.\n\nH is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t=t₁ to t₁+H-1}, so for H actions, t from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t₁ + H is set.\n\nBut we want position at turn t₁ + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIn the example, at turn t=14, y14=9, which is after actions from t=9 to t=13.\n\nt=9 to t=13 is 5 actions: a9 to a13.\n\nThen t₁ + H -1 =9 + H -1.\n\nSet this equal to 14, so 9+H-1=14, H=6.\n\nThen for H=6, T=9+6-1=14, y14=9.\n\nActions from t=9 to t=14? t from t₁ to t₁+H-1=9 to 9+6-1=14, so actions a9 to a14.\n\nBut at t=14, if we are at y14=9, we take a14, which might be S, for example.\n\nBut we are already at 9, so it's fine.\n\nWith 5 actions, we reach y14=9 at turn 14.\n\nFor H=5, T=9+5-1=13, we want y13=9.\n\nBut with actions from t=9 to t=12 (4 actions), we can have y13 at most 8, as above, so y13=8 if we went up four times, then to reach y13=9, we need to be at 9 at turn 13, which requires from turn 9, in 4 actions, go from 4 to 9, impossible since only +4 max.\n\nSo minimum T for y_T=9 is 14, with H=6 actions: a9 to a14, with a9 to a13 being U, and a14 could be S or U, but U would go to 10, which is invalid, so S.\n\ny between 0 and 9, so from 9, U to 10 not allowed, so must S or D, but to stay, S.\n\nBut in the sequence, when we reach 9, we can stop.\n\nFor H=5, actions a9 to a13, positions from y10 to y14.\n\ny14=9, but we want y_T with T= t₁+H-1=9+5-1=13 to be 9, but y13 is before a13, at turn 13, y13 could be 8, then a13=U to y14=9.\n\nSo y13=8 ≠9.\n\nSo to have y13=9, we need to be at 9 at turn 13, which requires from turn 9 to turn 13, in 4 steps: from t=9 to t=10,11,12,13, so 4 actions: a9,a10,a11,a12 determine y10 to y13.\n\ny13 = y12 + Δy12, and y12 = y11 + Δy11, etc., from y9=4, after 4 actions, y13 <=4+4=8<9, so impossible to have y13=9.\n\nSimilarly, only at t=14, y14=9 possible with 5 up actions.\n\nThus, for y_T=9 with T=14, we need H such that T= t₁ + H -1 =9 + H -1=14, so H=6.\n\nThen actions at t=9 to t=14 (6 actions), but at t=14, we take a14, but we are already at y14=9 if we did the actions.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet's read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t₁ + t.\n\nSo action times: t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter taking these actions, the position at time t₁ + H is set.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t₁ + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nAt turn t₁ + H -1, we are at position y_{t₁ + H -1}, and we take action a_{t₁ + H -1}, which moves to y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nFor y_{t₁ + H -1} to be 9, that means at that turn, we are already at 9, and we take an action, which could be S to stay, or U/D but that would move away.\n\nBut to reach at that turn, we need to be at 9 at the start of the turn.\n\nThe actions before should bring us to 9 at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nFor example, with t₁=9, we want y_T =9 for T= t₁ + H -1.\n\nT min=14 as above.\n\nSo for T=14, y14=9.\n\nThen 14 =9 + H -1, so H=6.\n\nActions from t=9 to t=14? t from t₁ to t₁+H-1=9 to 9+6-1=14, so actions a9 to a14.\n\nAt turn 14, we are at y14=9, and we take a14, which should be S to stay, or it could be anything, but since we are at 9, and we need to reach at turn 14, taking a14 is part of the sequence, but the position at turn 14 is already 9 before taking a14.\n\nThe action at turn 14 will affect y15, but we don't care.\n\nFor the purpose, with H=6, actions a9 to a14, with a9 to a13 being U, and a14 being S, for example.\n\nBut we can have a14 as U, but y15=10 invalid, so must be S or D, but D to 8, then not at 9, but we are at 9 at turn 14, so it's reached, but the action might move us away, but the position at turn 14 is 9.\n\nThen for the sequence, we can put a14=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the direct path, we can have 5 U actions from a9 to a13, reaching y14=9 at turn 14.\n\nThen for H, to have y_T=9 with T= t₁+H-1=14, so 9+H-1=14, H=6, so we need one more action, a14=S.\n\nBut that seems redundant, but necessary for the format.\n\nPerhaps for the last action, if we are at 8 at turn 13, take U to y14=9, then at turn 14, y14=9, and we take no action, but the sequence includes actions up to when we reach.\n\nI think for consistency, we have to include the actions as per the definition.\n\nIn this case, for the direct path, we can reach at turn 14 with 5 up actions, but for the sequence, H=6 with a14=S.\n\nBut let's first see if the direct path works with the cars.\n\nEarlier I thought it does.\n\nIn my initial plan: at t=9, y=4, take U to y=5 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, on y=5, safe, take U to y=6 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, on y=6, safe (since collision only at t=10), take U to y=7 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, on y=7, safe, take U to y=8 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, on y=8, safe, take U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, on y=9, safe.\n\nActions: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U.\n\nWe reached y=9 at turn 14.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we want to reach at turn t₁ + H -1 =14.\n\nt₁=9, so 9 + H -1 =14, thus H=6.\n\nThen actions from t=9 to t=14? t from t₁ to t₁+H-1=9 to 14 for H=6.\n\nBut we have actions only up to t=13 to reach y14=9.\n\nAt turn t=14, we need to take an action a14.\n\nSince y14=9, we can take a14=S.\n\nSo the sequence is a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=S.\n\nBut that seems odd, but it should be fine.\n\nTo have y13=9, but impossible as we saw.\n\nSo H=6 is minimum possible for reaching at turn 14.\n\nNow, back to the car avoidance.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=10, we are on y=5, safe.\n\nt=11, on y=6, but freeway 6 collision only at t=10, not at t=11, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut is there a problem with other freeways?\n\nFreeway 1 has collision at t=16 to 19, but we are not on y=1, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut freeway 6 collision at t=10.\n\nIn our path, at t=10, we are on y=5, not y=6.\n\nAt t=11, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all clear.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, but with this, H=6.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier? Impossible, as above.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 4.\n\nOr if we can move faster, but no.\n\nSo H=6 is minimum.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nAt t=10, collision on y=6.\n\nWe are not on y=6 at t=10.\n\nIn our sequence, at t=10, we are on y=5.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=6, no collision.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 later or earlier, but since we need to go up, and no other constraints, this should be fine.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nt₁=9.\n\nWe need sequence for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=6, so t=0 to 5, actions at t=9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nWith a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=S.\n\nBut a13=U to go from y13 to y14.\n\nAt turn 13, we are at y13=8 (if previous actions), then a13=U to y14=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, y14=9, a14=S.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, perhaps we can be at y=9 at turn 13, but impossible.\n\nAnother way: if at turn 12, we are at y12=8, take U to y13=9, then at turn 13, y13=9.\n\nThen for that, we need y13=9.\n\nFrom y9=4, to y13=9, need to increase by 5 in 4 actions: a9,a10,a11,a12.\n\nBut each action changes y by at most 1, so after 4 actions, y13 <=4+4=8<9, so impossible.\n\nThus, minimum reachable turn is 14 with y14=9.\n\nThus H must be 6 for the sequence.\n\nNow, in this case, with the direct path, it works.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? For example, to avoid y=6 at certain times, but in this case, no need.\n\nFreeway 6 has collision only at t=10, so as long as not on y=6 at t=10, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut what about freeway 7 and 8 at t=9? But we not on them.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at t=12, which is fine.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 7 at other times.\n\nFreeway 7: cars at t=9 collision, but at t=12, Δt=3, span [ -5+18, 6+18] = [13,24] >0, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but freeway 6 has two cars, but we only care about x=0.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, at t=10, the second car has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so collision if on y=6.\n\nBut we avoid that.\n\nNow, but in the table, freeway 6 has two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car at t=10: [25+12*1, 36+12*1]= [37,48]>0, safe.\n\nSecond car: [-23+12, -12+12]= [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, but we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, H=6, actions from t=9 to t=14.\n\nBut t=14 is the action at turn 14.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=5 with reaching at turn 13, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: can we go down to avoid something? But since we need to go to 9, going down would take more turns, so not minimal H.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=3, then we need even more steps to go up.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, direct path is best.\n\nBut let's see if there is a constraint that forces us to wait.\n\nFor example, at t=10, if we were to go to y=6, it would collide, but we go to y=5 instead.\n\nIn our sequence, we go to y=5 at t=10, fine.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=4 for one turn.\n\nAt t=9, take S, then at t=10, still y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is safe, but then at t=10, take U to y=5 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=5, take U to y=6 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, on y=6, safe? At t=12, freeway 6: Δt=3, second car [-23+36, -12+36]= [13,24]>0, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=13, U to y=8 at t=14, U to y=9 at t=15.\n\nThen reached at t=15, later than 14, with more turns, H larger.\n\nSo worse.\n\nGo down: even worse.\n\nSo direct path is optimal.\n\nThus, actions: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, and for a14, since we are at y=9, must take S to stay, as U or D not allowed or would move away.\n\ny between 0 and 9, so from 9, U to 10 invalid, similarly D to 8, but we want to stay at 9.\n\nIn the action, if we take U, y_{15} would be 10, which is invalid, but the position is updated after action, so at turn t, we are at y_t, then take a_t, if a_t=U and y_t=9, y_{t+1} = min(9+1,9)=9? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, but y must be in [0,9], so probably it is clamped.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} \\in [0,9], so if it goes out, it stays at boundary, I assume.\n\n\"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(10,9) =9? Similarly, if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}= max(-1,0)=0.\n\nSo in this case, if at turn 14, y14=9, and we take U, y15=9, same as S.\n\nSimilarly, D would go to 8, but then not at 9.\n\nBut since we are at 9 at turn 14, and we take a14, which for the sequence, we can take S or U, both keep at 9.\n\nBut to be safe, take S.\n\nIn the output, it should be fine.\n\nBut in the minimal sequence, since we reach at turn 14, and for H=6, we have to include a14.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, H=6.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (for t=9)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U  (t=10)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1+5} = S  (t=14)\n\nt from 0 to H-1=5, so t=0: a_{t1+0} = a9\n\nt=1: a10\n\n...\n\nt=5: a_{t1+5} = a14\n\nNow, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=S\n\nBut a13=U: at turn 13, we are at y13=8 (if previous), take U to y14=9.\n\nThen a14=S at turn 14.\n\nIn terms of the position at turn t1+H-1=t1+5=14, y14=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid writing a14, but we have to.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 13 with y13=9, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: can we be at y=9 earlier by going to y=9 directly? No.\n\nOr, since y=9 is not freeway, but we have to be on the freeways to move.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=6 is correct.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but we are not at risk.\n\nBut let's list all freeways and when collision happens to confirm.\n\nFreeway 1: collision at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: safe\n\n3: safe\n\n4: safe\n\n5: safe\n\nFreeway 6: collision at T=10 only\n\nFreeway 7: collision at T=9 only\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=9 only\n\nIn our path:\n\nt=9: on y=4, safe\n\nt=10: on y=5, safe\n\nt=11: on y=6, safe (T=11 not 10)\n\nt=12: on y=7, safe (T=12 not 9)\n\nt=13: on y=8, safe (T=13 not 9)\n\nt=14: on y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSuppose we try to go faster, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some freeway by moving multiple, but no, each action only changes y by 1.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the player position is (0,y), and we move vertically, so we have to go through each y.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (which is a9)\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\nThen \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\"\n\netc.\n\nSo for t_1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut Turn 14 is t_1 + 5, since t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +5 =14 for H=6? t_1 + H -1 =9+6-1=14, yes.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t_1 + H -1 =14.\n\nThen we have actions from t=9 to t=14.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has two cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, at t=10, collision, but we not on it.\n\nBut what if we were forced to be on it? But we avoid.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 or 8, but at t=9, collision, but we on later.\n\nNow, but I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 7: (6,-5,right,6) at t=9, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut at other times, no.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the sequence should be as above.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to write the actions.\n\nNow, for a14, we put S.\n\nTo make H smaller, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer turns by not moving up every turn, but that would take longer.\n\nFor example, if we stay or go down, H larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, need 5 steps up, so 5 actions to move, but to be at position at turn T, with H actions.\n\nSince we start at turn t1, after k actions, at turn t1+k.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, we need T - t1 actions to move from y=4 to y=9, but since we start at t1, the number of actions to reach turn T is T - t1.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_t1.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn t1 + m, position y_{t1 + m}.\n\nSet y_{t1 + m} =9.\n\nThen m must be at least 5, since from 4 to 9, min 5 steps.\n\ny_{t1 + m} = y_t1 + sum of Δy from t1 to t1+m-1.\n\nEach |Δy| <=1, so to increase by 5, need at least 5 up actions, so m >=5.\n\ny_{t1 + m} =9, y_t1=4, so net +5, so number of U minus number of D must be 5, and number of actions is at least 5.\n\nEarliest at m=5, y_{t1+5} = y_{14} =9.\n\nThen actions a9 to a13 to achieve this.\n\nThen at turn 14, y14=9, and we need to have y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 9 + H -1 =14, so H=6.\n\nThen the sequence must include a14, which we set to S.\n\nPerhaps the action at the reach turn is not needed, but according to the problem, the sequence includes actions until the reach turn.\n\nI think we have to follow.\n\nSo for the output.\n\nThus, minimal H=6.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write with the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so for t_1=9, \"Turn 9: U\"\n\nBut in the answer, it should be with t_1.\n\nSince t_1 is given, we use the number.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 6 has a car at T=10, but we are not on it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any other car that could cause issue?\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 at t=9, but we on y=4.\n\nNow, but freeway 1 at later times, but we not go there.\n\nSo I think safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go through y=6 at t=11, which we do.\n\nBut in freeway 6, the first car (36,25,right,12) at all times min>0, no issue.\n\nOnly the second car at t=10.\n\nSo fine.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and a car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\n- **Freeway 1**: Collision at turns 16, 17, 18, 19. Safe at other times.\n- **Freeway 2**: Safe at all times (car min \\(x \\geq 25 > 0\\)).\n- **Freeway 3**: Safe at all times (car min \\(x \\geq 25 > 0\\)).\n- **Freeway 4**: Safe at all times (car min \\(x \\geq 25 > 0\\)).\n- **Freeway 5**: Safe at all times (car min \\(x \\geq 25 > 0\\)).\n- **Freeway 6**: Collision at turn 10 only (from car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\)). Safe at other times.\n- **Freeway 7**: Collision at turn 9 only (from car \\((6, -5, \\text{right}, 6)\\)). Safe at other times.\n- **Freeway 8**: Collision at turn 9 only (from car \\((6, -5, \\text{right}, 6)\\)). Safe at other times.\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\nThe player starts at \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 9. To reach \\((0, 9)\\), the player must increase \\(y\\) by 5, requiring at least 5 upward moves. The earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 14, achieved by moving up every turn from turn 9 to turn 13. However, the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + H - 1\\) must be \\((0, 9)\\). Setting \\(9 + H - 1 = 14\\) gives \\(H = 6\\). Thus, \\(H = 6\\) is the minimal number of turns, with the sequence including 5 up actions and a final stay action at turn 14 to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance\n- **Turn 9**: Player at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10**: Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe since collision only at turn 10). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe since collision only at turn 9). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13.\n- **Turn 13**: Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe since collision only at turn 9). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- **Turn 14**: Player at \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, safe). Action \\(S\\) to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 10, player is on \\(y = 5\\) (safe), not \\(y = 6\\) (collision).\n- At other turns, player is not on freeways during collision times.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- \\(H = 6\\)\n- Actions: \\(a_9 = U\\), \\(a_{10} = U\\), \\(a_{11} = U\\), \\(a_{12} = U\\), \\(a_{13} = U\\), \\(a_{14} = S\\)\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ } S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 10, player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nNote: The player updates position at the same time as the cars move. But note the collision rule: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T during turn T (so we check freeway y_T at turn T) and then moves to y_{T+1} for the next state.\n\nWe are starting at turn 10 at position (0,5). We are going to simulate turns t = 10, 11, 12, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways that matter are the ones the player is on at each turn. Since we start at y=5, and we can only move up, down, or stay, we will be on freeways 1 to 8 only when our y is between 1 and 8.\n\nThe car state for each freeway is given. Note that for a car, the span at time T (relative to t1=10) is:\n\nFor a left-moving car (d = 'left'): \n   Span(T) = [h - s*(T - 10), tau - s*(T - 10)]\nBut note: the given car state has head and tail. For left-moving, the head is the front? Actually, the update rule says:\n   Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note that if the car is moving left, then at a later time the positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \n   Span(t1) = [tau, head]? Actually, the update rule says: \n   For right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table might have been given with head and tail. In the update for right-moving, they write: \n   \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo in the table, for a right-moving car, the first number is the tail and the second is the head? Actually, they write: \n   For freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3) -> so that is (h, tau, d, s)? But the update rule for right uses [tau, h]. \n\nLooking at the update rule for right: \n   They write: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the initial state for a right-moving car is given as (h, tau) but then the span is [tau, h]? \n\nWait, the table says: \n   Freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3)\n\nBut the update rule for right-moving says: \n   Span(t1) = [tau, h] \n\nSo for freeway 1: tau = -29, h = -18? Then the span at t1 is [-29, -18]. \n\nBut then at time T, the span becomes: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-29 + 3*(T-10), -18 + 3*(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we would have: \n   [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in our problem, all cars in the given state are right-moving? Actually, the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3) -> right\nFreeway 2: (48,37,right,12) -> right\nFreeway 3: same\nFreeway 4: same\nFreeway 5: same\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) -> both right\nFreeway 7: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6) -> both right\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving. Therefore, for each car (given as (h, tau, d, s)) we have:\n   If d == 'right', then the initial span at t1=10 is [tau, h] (so the tail is the first coordinate and the head is the second? but the table gives (h, tau) ... so wait, the table says: \n        (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut the update rule for right uses [tau, h] meaning [tail, head]. So the first number in the tuple is the head? Actually, the problem states: \n        \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for a right-moving car: \n        head = h, tail = tau, and the car is moving right. The update rule for right-moving says: \n            Span(t1) = [tau, h]   -> because it says \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" for right.\n\nSo the initial span at t1=10 is [tau, h]. \n\nTherefore, for a car (h, tau, right, s), the span at time T (>=10) is:\n        [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we would use [h - s*(T-10), tau - s*(T-10)], but we don't have any.\n\nNow, we must avoid being on a freeway y at turn T if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the span of that car at time T.\n\nWe start at turn 10 at y=5. We can choose actions: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y same). And we must stay in [0,9].\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 10 onward. We need to check for each freeway we step on.\n\nNote: when we are at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). We are on freeway y_T at that turn. Then we choose an action that determines y_{T+1}. \n\nWe are not on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nSo for each turn T, we check the freeway we are currently on (which is y_T) for any car that has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nWe start at turn 10, y=5. So we check freeway 5 at T=10.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car: (48,37,right,12). \n   Span at T=10: [37, 48] (because for right: [tau, head] = [37,48])\n   Is 0 in [37,48]? No.\n\nSo we are safe at turn 10 on freeway 5.\n\nNow, we want to plan the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note that the turn is increasing and we are only concerned about the relative time from t1=10. Also, the car positions are linear in time so we can compute the car spans for any turn.\n\nHowever, note that the minimal H might be small because we start at y=5 and need to get to y=9, which is 4 steps up. But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nSo H must be at least 4 (if we go up every turn). But we must check if that path is safe.\n\nLet's check:\n\nOption 1: Go up 4 times: \n   Turn 10: at y=5 -> safe (as above)\n   Turn 11: we move to y=6 (by action U at turn10). Then at turn11 we are at y=6. \n        We must check freeway6 at turn11.\n\n   Freeway6 at turn11 (T=11) has two cars:\n        Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> span at T=11: [37+12*(1), 48+12*(1)] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n        Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> span at T=11: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? \n        But note: the car representation: (head, tail) = (0, -11) for a right-moving car. \n        So at t1=10: span = [tail, head] = [-11,0] -> which does contain 0? \n        However, at turn10 we were on freeway5, not freeway6. At turn11, we are on freeway6 and the car2 at turn11 has span: \n            [ -11 + 12*(11-10) , 0 + 12*(11-10) ] = [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]. \n        So safe.\n\n   Turn12: we move to y=7 (by action U at turn11). Then at turn12 we are at y=7.\n        Freeway7: two cars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n        For car1: (head=12, tail=1) -> at T=12: [1+6*(12-10), 12+6*(12-10)] = [1+12, 12+12] = [13,24] -> no 0.\n        Car2: (head=60, tail=49) -> [49+12,60+12] = [61,72] -> no.\n        Safe.\n\n   Turn13: we move to y=8 (by action U at turn12). Then at turn13 we are at y=8.\n        Freeway8: same as freeway7? \n        The table says freeway8: same two cars as freeway7? \n        Actually, the table:\n            | 8 | (12,1,right,6), (60,49,right,6) |\n        So at T=13:\n            Car1: [1+6*(13-10), 12+6*(13-10)] = [1+18, 12+18] = [19,30] -> no 0.\n            Car2: [49+6*3, 60+6*3] = [49+18,60+18] = [67,78] -> no.\n        Safe.\n\n   Turn14: we move to y=9 (by action U at turn13). Then we are at y=9 at turn14. Since y=9 is the goal and there are no freeway above 8 (freeways are 1-8), we don't check any freeway at turn14? \n        Actually, the collision rule says: collision occurs only on freeways y=1..8. So at y=9 we are safe.\n\nSo with 4 moves (all U) we can reach y=9 at turn14 (which is turn t1+4, so H=4 turns: turns 10,11,12,13).\n\nBut wait: at turn10 we start at y=5. Then:\n   Turn10: action U -> at the end of turn10 we are at y=6? \n        Actually, the update: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n        So after turn10 (action U) we get y11 = 5+1 = 6.\n        Then at turn11, we are at y=6.\n\n        So the positions by turn:\n            Turn10: y10 = 5 (initial at turn10)\n            Turn11: y11 = 6 (after action at turn10: U)\n            Turn12: y12 = 7 (after action at turn11: U)\n            Turn13: y13 = 8 (after action at turn12: U)\n            Turn14: y14 = 9 (after action at turn13: U)\n\n        And we are done at turn14.\n\nBut we must check each turn when we are on a freeway (1-8). \n   Turn10: y=5 -> freeway5 -> safe (as above)\n   Turn11: y=6 -> freeway6 -> safe (as above: [49,60] and [1,12] for the two cars, no 0)\n   Turn12: y=7 -> freeway7 -> safe (as above: [13,24] and [61,72])\n   Turn13: y=8 -> freeway8 -> safe (as above: [19,30] and [67,78])\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 4 turns.\n\nBut wait: at turn10, after taking action U, we are at y=6 at turn11. But at turn10, we are at y=5. So we are only on freeway5 at turn10 and freeway6 at turn11, etc.\n\nSo the sequence of actions would be:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nThen at turn14, we are at y=9 and we stop. So H=4.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1. So we need 4 actions: at t1 (10), t1+1 (11), t1+2 (12), t1+3 (13).\n\nBut let me double-check freeway6 at turn11 for the second car: \n   Car2: (head=0, tail=-11) at t1=10. \n        At t1=10: span = [tail, head] = [-11,0] -> which includes 0? \n        But wait: at turn10, we are not on freeway6. We are on freeway5. So we don't check freeway6 at turn10.\n\n        At turn11: \n            The car has moved: \n                tail_new = -11 + 12*(11-10) = -11+12 = 1\n                head_new = 0 + 12 = 12\n            So span = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn10: \n   Car: (48,37,right,12) -> span at t1=10: [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\nFreeway7 at turn12: \n   First car: (12,1,right,6) -> at T=12: [1+6*(2)=1+12=13, 12+12=24] -> 0 not in.\n   Second car: (60,49,right,6) -> [49+12=61, 60+12=72] -> 0 not in.\n\nFreeway8 at turn13: \n   Same cars: \n        First: [1+6*3=1+18=19, 12+18=30] -> no.\n        Second: [49+18=67, 60+18=78] -> no.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns\". 4 is the minimum because we start at 5 and need to get to 9: 4 steps up.\n\nHowever, what if we try to go faster? We can't because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo H=4 is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at turn14 (after 4 actions). So we are done at turn14.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in fewer? We can't because we start at 5 and 9 is 4 away.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nBut wait: the answer format says:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nBut note: the sequence has 4 actions, and we reach at turn14 (which is after 4 actions, so the last action is at turn13).\n\nBut what if we don't have to take an action at the turn we arrive? The problem says: we take actions for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo in our case, H=4.\n\nBut let me check if there is any danger at turn10 on freeway5? We already did.\n\nHowever, let me check freeway5 at turn10 again: \n   The car on freeway5: (48,37,right,12) -> at turn10: [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway6 at turn10? We are not on freeway6 at turn10, so we don't care.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5 at later turns? We are only on freeway5 at turn10. Then we leave.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? We don't.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway6 at turn10 has span [-11,0] -> which includes 0. But we are not on freeway6 at turn10, so safe. And we are on freeway6 at turn11 when the car has moved to [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nBut wait: after taking action at turn10 (U), we are at y=6 at turn11. Then at turn11 we take U and go to y=7 at turn12, etc.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway6 at turn11 again: \n   The second car: (0, -11, right, 12) at t1=10: \n        At turn10: [ -11, 0 ] -> includes 0? Yes, but we are not on freeway6 at turn10.\n        At turn11: [ -11 + 12, 0+12 ] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what if we did not move at turn10? Then we would be at y=5 at turn11. Then we would have to check freeway5 at turn11.\n\nFreeway5 at turn11: \n   The car: (48,37,right,12) -> \n        at turn11: [37+12*(1), 48+12*(1)] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo that would be safe too. But then we would be at y=5 at turn11 and then we would need 4 more moves to get to 9, so total 5 moves. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 4.\n\nBut let me check if there is any problem at turn13 when we are at y=8: \n   Freeway8: two cars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6) at t1=10.\n        At turn13: T=13 -> 13-10=3.\n        First car: [1+6*3, 12+6*3] = [1+18, 12+18] = [19,30] -> 0 not in.\n        Second car: [49+18,60+18] = [67,78] -> no.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo I think the answer is 4 moves: all U.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we only check the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the answer format uses curly braces for the action indices? But the example writes:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nBut let me write it exactly as the format.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nBut note: the initial turn is t1=10, and we take actions at turn10,11,12,13 (4 actions) and then at turn14 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut what if we consider that at turn13 we take the last U and then we are at 9 at turn14? And we don't need to take an action at turn14 because we already reached? The problem says: we need a sequence of actions until the turn when we reach. The last action is taken at turn13 and then at the next state (turn14) we are at 9.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there is a car that might hit us if we go slower? But we are going as fast as possible.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, let's check if we try to go up at turn10 and then wait? That would be slower.\n\nOr if we go up and then down? That would be longer.\n\nSo minimal is 4.\n\nBut what about freeway1 to 4? We are never on them? So we don't care.\n\nBut wait: we start at y=5 and go to 6,7,8,9. So we are never on freeways 1,2,3,4,9? (freeway9 doesn't exist, and 9 is the goal).\n\nSo we only care about freeways 5,6,7,8 at turns 10,11,12,13 respectively.\n\nAnd we checked: all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is four U's.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so we write:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nBut to match the format exactly, we can write without the array? The problem shows a box with multiple lines.\n\nBut the example in the problem says:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n}\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn13 (which is t1+3) and we have 4 actions. So the sequence is for t=0 to 3 (relative to t1).\n\nYes.\n\nBut I see a potential issue: at turn10, we are at y=5. We take U and then at turn11 we are at y=6. But what if we take a different action? We don't need to.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway5 at turn10: it is safe. And we leave freeway5 immediately.\n\nBut what if we stay at turn10? Then we would be at y=5 at turn11. And then we can move up. But that would take 5 moves: \n   turn10: S -> y11=5\n   turn11: U -> y12=6\n   turn12: U -> y13=7\n   turn13: U -> y14=8\n   turn14: U -> y15=9 -> so 5 moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, that would be even worse.\n\nSo we stick with U at every step.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway8 at turn13? We have two cars. What if we had arrived earlier? But we cannot because we are moving one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, what if we move up two times and then wait? But that would be the same as going straight.\n\nSo I think the plan is optimal.\n\nBut just to be extra cautious, let me check freeway6 at turn11 again: \n   The second car: at turn10: [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes, but we are not on freeway6 at turn10.\n   At turn11: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nBut what if we had stayed at freeway6 for two turns? We don't.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn12: \n   The first car: at turn10: [1,12] -> includes 0? 0 is not in [1,12] (since 1 to 12, integers? but 0 is not in). \n        Actually, the span is an interval of real numbers?

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 6) at turn t_1 = 11. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions that move over time. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe note says that when you move to a new freeway, you are not considered on that new freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T, so you only check for cars on y_T at turn T. At turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=11.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -15, tail -26, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-26, -15] at t_1=11. As time increases, for right-moving, span becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=6 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding collisions.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. But to reach y=9, we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so x is always 0, we're only moving vertically.\n\nNow, from y=6 to y=9, we need to increase y by 3. So at minimum, we can do three U actions, but we have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nBut we might need to stay or move down sometimes to avoid collisions, which could increase the number of turns.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should aim for the shortest path, but with constraints.\n\nFirst, let's understand where the cars are at different turns relative to t_1=11.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, Δt = T - 11.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, the span at time T is:\n\nIf direction right: [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nIf direction left: [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nCollision occurs if player is on freeway y at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn T if y_T = y, and y between 1 and 8.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars and their spans as function of Δt.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCar: direction right, τ = -26, h = -15, s = 3\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -26 + 3*Δt , -15 + 3*Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -26 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -15 + 3Δt\n\nWhich is -26 + 3Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -15 + 3Δt\n\nSo 3Δt <= 26 and 3Δt >= 15? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-26 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 26 => Δt <= 26/3 ≈ 8.666, so Δt <= 8 since integer turns? Δt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so Δt is integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -15 + 3Δt => 3Δt >= 15 => Δt >= 5\n\nSo for Δt >=5 and Δt <=8, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nΔt=5: [ -26 +15, -15+15] = [-11, 0], 0 is included? Span is [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt], and since it's a closed interval I assume, so if 0 is equal to endpoint, it might be collision.\n\nThe span is [head, tail] or [tail, head] depending on direction, but for collision, it says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", so if 0 is equal to endpoint, it is included.\n\nIn the inequality, when 0 = endpoint, it should be collision.\n\nFor freeway 1, at Δt=5: [ -26 + 3*5, -15 + 3*5] = [-26+15, -15+15] = [-11, 0], so 0 is in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt Δt=6: [-26+18, -15+18] = [-8,3], 0 in between.\n\nUp to Δt=8: [-26+24, -15+24] = [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔt=9: [-26+27, -15+27] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so no collision for Δt=9 and above.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=4: [-26+12, -15+12] = [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision possible only when player is on y=1 at turns where Δt in {5,6,7,8}\n\nNow, freeway 2: one car: (60,49, right,12)\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [49 + 12Δt, 60 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 49 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 60 + 12Δt\n\nBut 49 + 12Δt >=49 >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 <= 60+12Δt always true since 60>0, but 49+12Δt <=0? 49+12Δt <=0 implies 12Δt <= -49, impossible since Δt>=0. So 0 is never <= 49+12Δt because 49+12Δt >=49>0, so 0 cannot be <= left endpoint which is positive. Similarly, 0 < 49+12Δt for all Δt, so 0 not in [49+12Δt, 60+12Δt] since the interval is entirely positive. Thus no collision ever on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (60,49,right,12), identical, so same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 4: same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 5: same, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) same as above, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [1 + 12Δt, 12 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 1+12Δt <= 0 <= 12+12Δt\n\n1+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <= -1, impossible for Δt>=0. Since 1+12Δt >=1>0, so 0 < 1+12Δt <= left endpoint, so 0 not in [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt]. Thus no collision from this car either.\n\nSo freeway 6 has no possible collision at all.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [7 + 6Δt, 18 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if 7+6Δt <= 0 <= 18+6Δt\n\n7+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <= -7, impossible. 7+6Δt >=7>0, so 0 not in interval. No collision.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-59 + 6Δt, -48 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 6Δt\n\nSo -59 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so Δt <=9\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 6Δt => 6Δt >=48 => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt=8,9\n\nΔt=8: [-59 + 48, -48 + 48] = [-11, 0], 0 in [-11,0]\n\nΔt=9: [-59 + 54, -48 + 54] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, collision possible only from second car when player on y=7 at Δt=8 or 9.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6), as above, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,6), same as freeway 7 second car.\n\nSo for freeway 8, collision possible only at Δt=8 or 9 when on y=8.\n\nNow summarize:\n\nFreeway 1: collision at Δt=5,6,7,8 (when on y=1)\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: no collision\n\nFreeway 6: no collision\n\nFreeway 7: collision at Δt=8,9 (when on y=7)\n\nFreeway 8: collision at Δt=8,9 (when on y=8)\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at Δt=0 (turn t_1=11)\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal vertical move: from 6 to 9, need +3, so at least 3 turns if we go up each time.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, we need to avoid:\n\n- Being on y=1 at Δt=5,6,7,8\n\n- Being on y=7 at Δt=8,9\n\n- Being on y=8 at Δt=8,9\n\nSince freeway 2,3,4,5,6 have no collision, we can be on them anytime.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, which has no collision, so we can stay or move from there.\n\nNow, at start: turn Δt=0, position y=6, which is freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is above, so we need to go up: U actions.\n\nBut if we go directly, we might hit y=7 or y=8 at bad times.\n\nLet's consider moving up directly.\n\nSuppose we do U at each turn.\n\nStart at t=11, y=6.\n\nAction at t=11: U, then y=7 at turn t=12? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn T, player position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAnd at turn T, we check collision based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nFor turn t_1=11, we start at (0,6), so at turn 11, we are on y=6.\n\nSince y=6 has no collision at any time, safe.\n\nNow, we take action a_{11}, which affects y_{12}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, we are at y_{12}, and so on.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions starts from t_1=11.\n\nIn the answer, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc., until we reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H - 1, we have y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's see.\n\nDefine the turns carefully.\n\nSet t_1 = 11.\n\nAt turn 11, position y_11 = 6.\n\nWe take action a_11, then y_12 = y_11 + Δy_11\n\nThen at turn 12, position y_12, take a_12, and so on.\n\nWe reach y = 9 at some turn, say T, so y_T = 9.\n\nT = t_1 + H for some H, but let's see the index.\n\nAfter k actions, we have moved to turn t_1 + k.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 + 1, position y_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the minimal H such that we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nThe number of turns from start to finish is H, but since we start at turn t_1 and end at turn t_1 + H, it takes H turns to reach, including the actions taken.\n\nWe need to find min H and actions.\n\nSince we need to go up, H at least 3.\n\nCan we do it in 3 turns?\n\nSuppose actions: U, U, U\n\nThen:\n\nAt turn 11: y=6, take a11=U\n\ny12 = 7\n\nAt turn 12: y=7, which is freeway 7. Now, Δt = T - t1 = 12 - 11 =1? t1=11, T=12, Δt=1\n\nFor freeway 7, collision at Δt=8 or9, not at Δt=1, so safe. Take a12=U\n\ny13=8\n\nAt turn 13: y=8, freeway 8. Δt=13-11=2. Collision for y=8 at Δt=8 or9, not 2, safe. Take a13=U\n\ny14=9\n\nAt turn 14: y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached (0,9).\n\nBut is turn 14 the turn we reach? At turn 14, y14=9, so we have reached.\n\nNow, actions: at t11: U, t12: U, t13: U, and at t14 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=3 actions: a11, a12, a13.\n\nBut in terms of the sequence, we have three actions, and we reach at turn t1 + 3 =14.\n\nBut let's verify if there are any collisions.\n\nAt turn 11: y=6, freeway 6, no collision possible, safe.\n\nAction U, so y12=7.\n\nTurn 12: y=7, freeway 7. Δt=12-11=1. For freeway 7, collision only at Δt=8 or9, so at Δt=1, no car at x=0, safe. Action U, y13=8.\n\nTurn 13: y=8, freeway 8. Δt=2, collision only at Δt=8 or9, safe. Action U, y14=9.\n\nTurn 14: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reached in 3 turns with no issues.\n\nBut is there a problem? Freeway 1 has collisions at Δt=5-8, but we never went to y=1, so no issue.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have collisions at Δt=8,9, but at turn 12 and 13, Δt=1 and 2, which are early, no problem.\n\nSo it seems we can go directly up in 3 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 at Δt=1: second car span: [-59 +6*1, -48 +6*1] = [-53,-42], not near 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same.\n\nAnd at Δt=8 or9, we are not on those freeways.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=7 at turn 12 (Δt=1), y=8 at turn 13 (Δt=2), both safe.\n\nSo why is there a car on freeway 6 with (12,1,right,12) at t1, but we said no collision, and we were on y=6 at turn 11, which is fine.\n\nBut in the state, freeway 6 has two cars, but both don't cause collision as we calculated.\n\nSo it seems straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nThe player starts at y=6, which is freeway 6, and we move to y=7 at turn 12.\n\nWhen we move to y=7 at turn 12, we are on y=7 at turn 12, and we check cars on freeway 7 at turn 12, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at turn 13.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut y=9 is reached at turn 14.\n\nNow, minimal H: with 3 actions, we reach at turn t1 + 3 =14.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer? From y=6 to y=9, need at least 3 up moves, so H=3 is minimal.\n\nWe could do S or D to delay, but that would increase H, so not minimal.\n\nThus, with U,U,U, we can reach in 3 turns.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nAnd that's it, since after three actions, at turn t1+3=14, y=9.\n\nt1=11, so:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd done.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, here H=3, actions at t=0,1,2 relative to start.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn 11: a_{11}\n\nTurn 12: a_{12}\n\nTurn 13: a_{13}\n\nBut we don't need to write beyond, since after a13, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" such that after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nSo for H=3, actions at t=11,12,13.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut is there any reason this might not work?\n\nPerhaps I need to check if at turn 11, when we are on y=6, if there is a car at that time.\n\nAt turn 11, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nCars on freeway 6: first car (60,49,right,12) at Δt=0, span [49,60], not near 0.\n\nSecond car (12,1,right,12) at Δt=0, span [1,12], which is from x=1 to x=12, so x=0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at other turns, no issue.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 6, it says (12,1,right,12), which at t1, span [1,12], so x=0 not included.\n\nIf it were [0,12], it would include, but here tail=1, head=12, so min=1, max=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut why are there cars on other freeways? Maybe to tempt us to go down or something, but we don't need to.\n\nPerhaps for larger H, but min H is 3.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision condition again.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a new freeway, at turn T you are still on the old one.\n\nIn this case, when we are at turn 12, y=7, we are on freeway 7 at that turn.\n\nAnd we move to y=8 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, we are on y=8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? But from y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 steps up, so no.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=3 should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 7 and 8 at later times, but we are not there at those times.\n\nFor example, if we were on y=7 at Δt=8, it would be collision, but we are at Δt=1, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's okay.\n\nPerhaps the player can move down to avoid something, but here no need.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is three Ups.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 6 has (12,1,right,12) at t1, and since we are at y=6 at turn 11, and x=0 not in [1,12], safe.\n\nAnd moving up immediately.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if staying is better, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo I think H=3 with U,U,U.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nH=3.\n\nBut in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for t=0,1,2: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}\n\nIn the box:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 11: a_{11} = U \\\\  \nTurn 12: a_{12} = U \\\\  \nTurn 13: a_{13} = U  \n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"a_{t_1 + t}\" for t=0 to H-1, so for t=0: t1+0=11, a11=U\n\nt=1: t1+1=12, a12=U\n\nt=2: t1+2=13, a13=U\n\nAnd no need for turn 14, since at turn 14 we are already at y=9.\n\nThe sequence ends with the action that brings us to y=9.\n\nAfter a13 at turn 13, y14=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some point we might be forced to collide, but not in this case.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 1 has collisions at Δt=5-8, but since we are going up, we avoid y=1 entirely.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we do something else.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=6 for some turns, then go up, but that would take more than 3 turns to reach y=9, so H>3, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, even worse.\n\nSo min H=3 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be three U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The direct path from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least three \"U\" (up) actions, as each \"U\" increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- Collision analysis for each freeway at relevant turns (relative to \\(\\Delta t = T - 11\\)) shows:\n  - **Freeway 1**: Collision possible at \\(\\Delta t = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) (when player is on \\(y = 1\\)).\n  - **Freeways 2-6**: No collision possible at any turn.\n  - **Freeway 7**: Collision possible at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9\\) (when player is on \\(y = 7\\)).\n  - **Freeway 8**: Collision possible at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9\\) (when player is on \\(y = 8\\)).\n\nWith the sequence \"U, U, U\":\n- At turn 11 (\\( \\Delta t = 0 \\)): Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, no collision).\n- Action \\(a_{11} = U\\), so \\(y_{12} = 7\\).\n- At turn 12 (\\( \\Delta t = 1 \\)): Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Collision occurs only at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9\\), so safe at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\). Action \\(a_{12} = U\\), so \\(y_{13} = 8\\).\n- At turn 13 (\\( \\Delta t = 2 \\)): Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Collision occurs only at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9\\), so safe at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\). Action \\(a_{13} = U\\), so \\(y_{14} = 9\\).\n- At turn 14: Player at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision. Goal reached.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 3\\) turns (actions at turns 11, 12, and 13), which is minimal since at least three \"U\" actions are required to increase \\(y\\) from 6 to 9. No alternative sequence with \\(H < 3\\) is possible, and delaying actions (e.g., using \"S\" or \"D\") would increase \\(H\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- \\(H = 3\\) turns, with actions at \\(t = t_1 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(2\\):\n  - Turn 11 (\\(t = 0\\)): \\(a_{11} = U\\)\n  - Turn 12 (\\(t = 1\\)): \\(a_{12} = U\\)\n  - Turn 13 (\\(t = 2\\)): \\(a_{13} = U\\)\n\nAfter these actions, at turn 14, the player is at (0, 9).\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 11: a_{11} = U \\\\  \nTurn 12: a_{12} = U \\\\  \nTurn 13: a_{13} = U  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 12, and the player is at (0,7). The goal is to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is in the vertical direction only, and the horizontal is fixed at 0.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car's span at that turn includes 0 (the player's x-coordinate).\n\nImportant note: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on row y and will be on row y' at the next turn. So when we are at turn T, we are on the row we were at the beginning of the turn. Therefore, when we move at turn T, we are vulnerable to the cars on the current row (y_T) at that turn, and then at the next turn we will be on the new row.\n\nWe start at (0,7) at turn 12. We need to get to (0,9). The minimal number of turns is at least 2 (if we go up twice). But we must avoid the cars on rows 7 and 8.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we are on at each turn whether there is a car that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nLet's denote the current turn as t = 12. We are on row 7.\n\nWe have to consider the next few turns until we reach row 9.\n\nFirst, note the car state at the freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 3) -> moving right, so the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, for right-moving: \n  At turn T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation says for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at time T, the car is from (tau + s*(T-t1)) to (h + s*(T-t1)).\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in this problem, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nAll cars in the given state are right-moving? Yes, all have direction \"right\".\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, right, s) at time t1, at time T (>=t1), the span is:\n  [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the initial representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but the description says: \n  Right-moving: [tau, h] -> meaning the head is at the higher coordinate? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n\nBut in the table, we have for freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 3). So which is head and which is tail? The representation is: (head, tail, ...). \n\nIn the update rule for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So that means the tail is at tau and the head at h? But note that in the example, h=-12 and tau=-23. Since the car is moving right, the head should be the rightmost (larger x) and tail the leftmost. But -12 > -23, so that makes sense: the head is at -12 and the tail at -23. So the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-23, -12].\n\nThen at time T, the car moves right, so the span becomes: [-23 + 3*(T-12), -12 + 3*(T-12)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12). \n  First car: [ -59 + 12*(T-12), -48 + 12*(T-12) ]\n  Second car: [13 + 12*(T-12), 24 + 12*(T-12)] -> but wait, the representation is (head, tail). For the second car: head=24, tail=13? Then the span at t1 is [13,24]. Then at T: [13+12*(T-12), 24+12*(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6). \n  First car: [13+6*(T-12), 24+6*(T-12)]\n  Second car: [-53+6*(T-12), -42+6*(T-12)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, we are at turn 12, at row 7. We must avoid collisions on row 7 at turn 12? Actually, at turn 12 we are at row 7, so we are vulnerable to cars on row 7 at turn 12? But note: the collision condition is at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo at turn 12, we are on row 7. We must check row 7 at turn 12.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 12: two cars:\n  Car1: [13+6*(12-12), 24+6*(12-12)] = [13,24] -> 0 is not in [13,24]\n  Car2: [-53+6*0, -42+6*0] = [-53,-42] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo at turn 12, row 7 is safe.\n\nNow, we plan the next moves. We want to get to row 9. The moves:\n\nOption 1: Go up twice: \n  Turn 12: U -> then at turn 13 we are at row 8.\n  Turn 13: U -> then at turn 14 we are at row 9 -> done in 2 moves.\n\nBut we must check row 8 at turn 13? Because at turn 13 we are on row 8 (if we moved up at turn 12). And then at turn 14 we are on row 9, but we don't need to check row 9 because the freeways are only 1-8? The goal is (0,9) and 9 is not a freeway? So we don't care about collisions on row 9? The problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So row 9 is safe.\n\nBut we must check row 8 at turn 13.\n\nWhat is the state of row 8 at turn 13? \n  Freeway 8 at turn 13: two cars (same as freeway 7 at turn 12? but freeway 8 has its own cars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6) at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 13 (T=13, t1=12 -> delta=1):\n  Car1: [13+6*(13-12), 24+6*(13-12)] = [13+6, 24+6] = [19,30] -> 0 not in [19,30]\n  Car2: [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36]\n\nSo row 8 at turn 13 is safe.\n\nBut wait, what about row 7 at turn 12? We already checked: safe.\n\nSo two moves: \n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n\nBut let me check if we are on row 7 at turn 12: safe, then we move to row 8 at turn 13. Then at turn 13 we are on row 8: safe. Then at turn 14 we are on row 9: goal.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut wait, what if we do something else? We don't need to, because 2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the cars on row 6? We don't go to row 6, so we don't care.\n\nBut wait, what about row 8 at turn 12? We are not on row 8 at turn 12, so we don't check. We only check the row we are on at each turn.\n\nBut wait, what if we move to row 8 at turn 12? But we start at row 7, we can only move to row 8 at the next turn by going up. So we are on row 7 at turn 12, then row 8 at turn 13.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nTurn 12: U -> y=8 at turn 13? Actually, at turn 12 we are at y=7, then we do U: at the next turn (turn 13) we are at y=8.\n\nThen at turn 13: U -> at turn 14 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=2 turns? The sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. We are at turn 12 (t=0) and then turn 13 (t=1). So H=2.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 7 at turn 12: safe. Freeway 8 at turn 13: safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway 8 has two cars at turn 13: [19,30] and [-47,-36] -> both avoid 0.\n\nBut what about freeway 6? We don't go there.\n\nBut wait, what if we do a different move? We don't need to because 2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint for row 8 at turn 12? We are not there.\n\nBut note: the problem says that at turn T, we are on row y_T. When we move at turn T, we are still on row y_T and then at turn T+1 we are on row y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for the two-move plan:\n\nTurn 12 (current): we are at row 7. We choose U -> so for turn 12, we are on row 7 -> check row 7 at turn 12: safe. Then we move to row 8 at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: we are at row 8. We choose U -> check row 8 at turn 13: safe. Then we move to row 9 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14 we are at row 9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait, the goal is reached at turn 14? Then H should be 2 because we started at turn 12 and we took two actions: at turn 12 and turn 13. Then we are at row 9 at turn 14.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H turns (i.e., at turn t1+H) we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the player update: after one action (at turn t1) we are at turn t1+1. So after H actions, we are at turn t1+H and the position is (0,9).\n\nSo in our case: \n  Start: turn 12, position 7.\n  After first action (U) at turn 12: at turn 13, position 8.\n  After second action (U) at turn 13: at turn 14, position 9.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn 14. So H=2.\n\nBut let me check if there is any danger at row 7 at turn 12? We already checked: freeway 7 at turn 12: \n  Car1: [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n  Car2: [-53,-42] -> 0 not in there.\n\nRow 8 at turn 13: \n  Car1: [19,30] -> 0 not in [19,30]\n  Car2: [-47,-36] -> 0 not in there.\n\nBut wait, what about the other freeways? We don't go to them, so we don't care.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway 6? It has two cars. But we are never on freeway 6.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", so 2.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in one turn? \n  To go from 7 to 9 in one turn? We can only move one step per turn. So impossible.\n\nSo 2 is minimal.\n\nBut why does the problem give cars on freeways 1 to 5 and 6? Maybe if we had to go through them? But we are starting at 7 and going to 8 and then 9. So we avoid freeways 1-6.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 at turn 12? We are not on freeway 8 at turn 12, so we don't care. But note: at turn 13 we are on freeway 8, and we checked turn 13.\n\nBut wait, what about the cars on freeway 8 at turn 12? They are at:\n  Car1: [13+6*(12-12)=13, 24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in there.\n  Car2: [-53, -42] -> 0 not in there.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 8 at turn 12, so it's irrelevant.\n\nSo I think the two-move plan is safe.\n\nBut wait, what if at turn 12 we do not go up? Then we might have to take more moves. But we want minimal H, so 2 is better.\n\nBut is there any reason we cannot go up at turn 12? Only if row 8 at turn 13 is not safe? But we checked: safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the car movements for freeway 8 at turn 13:\n\nFor the first car on freeway 8: (head=24, tail=13, right, speed=6) at turn 12.\nAt turn 13: T=13, t1=12 -> T-t1=1.\nSo tail becomes: 13 + 6*1 = 19\nhead becomes: 24 + 6*1 = 30\nSo span [19,30] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSecond car: (head=-42, tail=-53, right, speed=6) at turn 12.\nAt turn 13: tail = -53 + 6 = -47\nhead = -42 + 6 = -36\nspan [-47,-36] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about the other car on freeway 6? We don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2, and the actions are U and U.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1: \n  t=0: turn t1+0 = turn12: U\n  t=1: turn t1+1 = turn13: U\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in H=1? That would require going from 7 to 9 in one move? But the moves are only +1, -1, or 0. So impossible.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we try to go down? That would take more moves, so not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the two U moves.\n\nBut wait, what about the cars on freeway 7 at turn 12? We are at freeway 7 at turn 12 and we are safe. Then we leave to freeway 8 at turn 13. And freeway 8 at turn 13 is safe.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway 7 at turn 13? We are not on freeway 7 at turn 13, so we don't care. But for completeness:\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 13:\n  Car1: [13+6*(13-12)=19, 24+6=30] -> [19,30] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-53+6=-47, -42+6=-36] -> safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at turn 14? We are not there because we leave to row 9 at turn 14.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nBut why does the problem have cars on freeways 1-5 and 6? Maybe to distract? Or maybe if we started at a lower row? But we start at row 7.\n\nBut wait, the freeways are from 1 to 8. We are starting at 7, which is a freeway? Yes, and 8 is also. And 9 is not.\n\nSo I think we are good.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6 at turn 12? We are not on it, but just to see: \n  First car: (-48, -59, right,12) -> at turn 12: [ -59 + 12*(0) = -59, -48+0 = -48] -> [-59,-48] -> 0 not in.\n  Second car: (24,13,right,12) -> [13,24] at turn12 -> safe.\n\nBut we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal plan is two moves: U at turn12 and U at turn13.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nWe have H=2, and the sequence as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" meaning at turn t1 (which is 12) we take an action.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut wait, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so two actions: at t1 and t1+1.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a_{t1+t}\" for t=0 to H-1. So for t=0: a_{t1+0}=a_{12}, t=1: a_{13}. \n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the next turn? At turn 14 we are at 9 and we stop. So we don't need to output an action for turn 14.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut let me consider if there is any problem: what if at turn 12 we do something else? For example, if we stay at 7 at turn12? Then we are at 7 at turn13. But then we would need at least two more moves (to go from 7 to 8 to 9) so total 3 moves. Worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to 6, then we have to come back up, which would be at least 3 moves: 7->6, then 6->7, then 7->8, then 8->9? That's 4 moves. So worse.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 2. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 14.\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\):\n- At turn 12, the player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). The cars on freeway 7 at turn 12 have spans:\n  - \\([13, 24]\\) (from \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 6)\\)) and \\([-53, -42]\\) (from \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\)). Neither span contains 0, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 13, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 13 have spans:\n  - \\([19, 30]\\) (from \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 6)\\), advanced by 1 turn) and \\([-47, -36]\\) (from \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\), advanced by 1 turn). Neither span contains 0, so no collision occurs.\n\nNo other freeways are visited, and the goal \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 14. This is the minimal \\(H\\) since moving directly upward requires at least 2 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8). Note that the player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and the cars move horizontally on their respective freeways.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at the same turn.\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, they are considered to be on y at turn T and on y' at turn T+1. So during the move (at turn T) they are still on the starting row.\n\nWe start at turn 13 at position (0,8). We need to get to (0,9). Since we are at row 8 and we want to go to row 9 (which is the top, and note that row 9 is the goal and has no cars), we can only go up from row 8.\n\nBut note: we are currently at row 8. We can try to go up (U) at turn 13 to reach row 9 at turn 14. However, we must check if at turn 13 we are safe on row 8 and at turn 14 when we are on row 9 we are safe (row 9 has no cars, so safe). But we must also check the intermediate steps? Actually, when we are at turn 13 we are on row 8. Then we take action U at turn 13, so at turn 14 we are at row 9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence could be:\n  Turn 13: U\n\nBut we must check if at turn 13, when we are on row 8, is there a car on row 8 that covers x=0?\n\nLooking at the car state for freeway 8 (which is row 8):\n  Freeway 8: (30, 19, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nWe need to compute the car spans at turn 13 (current turn) and then at the next turns if we are going to be on that row.\n\nHowever, note that we are at turn 13 and we are on row 8. We must check the cars on row 8 at turn 13.\n\nFor the cars on freeway 8 at turn 13:\n\nFirst car: (30, 19, right, 6)\n  Direction: right -> so the car moves to the right. At turn 13, the head is at 30 and tail at 19? But note: the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving is:\n    [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table it is written as (h, tau, d, s). Let me read the update:\n\nFor right-moving: \n  Initially at t1: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> meaning tau is the left end and h is the right end?\nBut the table says: (head h, tail tau, ...). So we must interpret:\n\nThe table entry: (h, tau, d, s) for a right-moving car means:\n  At time t1, the car's head (front) is at h, and tail is at tau. Since it's moving right, the head is the rightmost. So the span at t1 is [tau, h] (if tau < h) because the car extends from tail (left) to head (right).\n\nBut note: the example for right-moving update: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for the first car on row8: (30, 19, right, 6)\n  This doesn't make sense because 19 (tail) should be less than 30 (head). But 19 < 30, so the span at t1 is [19, 30]. \n\nBut wait, the update rule for right-moving says: \n  Initially: [tau, h] -> so the representation (h, tau) is given as (30,19) meaning h=30 (head) and tau=19 (tail). So the span is [19,30] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n  Here, tail = -47, head = -36 -> so span at t1: [-47, -36].\n\nNow, at turn 13 (which is t1=13) we are at row8. We need to check if 0 is in the span of any car on row8 at turn 13.\n\nFor the first car: [19,30] -> 0 is not in [19,30]. \nFor the second car: [-47,-36] -> 0 is not in [-47,-36].\n\nTherefore, at turn 13, we are safe on row8.\n\nThen we take action U at turn 13. Then at turn 14, we are at row9. Row9 is not a freeway (the freeways are from 1 to 8) so we are safe.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns is 1? And the sequence is just one action: U at turn13.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". And we are starting at (0,8). So going up one step should be enough.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the car states for the next turn? Actually, we don't need to because we are leaving row8 at turn13 (by moving up) and we are not on row8 at turn14. But note: at the moment of turn13 we are still on row8 and we have already checked that we are safe.\n\nBut what about the goal? The goal is (0,9). At turn14 we are at (0,9). So we have reached the goal at turn14? But note: the sequence of actions is for turns starting at t1 (turn13) for H turns. So if we do one action at turn13, then H=1? But then the player position at turn13+H = turn14 is (0,9). So H=1.\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. So t=0 corresponds to turn t1 (13). So we have one action: a_{13}.\n\nHowever, let me check if we can stay? But we are already at row8 and we want to go to row9. We cannot go down because that would take us to row7 and then we have to come back. So going up is the only direct way.\n\nBut what if we are forced to wait because of a car? But at turn13, row8 is safe and we can move up. So why wait?\n\nBut wait, let me look at the car on row8 at turn14? Actually, we don't care because at turn14 we are on row9. However, note that if we had to stay on row8 for multiple turns we would have to check. But we are leaving immediately.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1, and the action is U.\n\nBut let me check the other freeways? We are only on row8 at turn13 and then row9 at turn14. We don't step on any other row in between.\n\nHowever, the problem says: we start at (0,8) at turn13. We take action U at turn13: so at turn14 we are at (0,9). We are done.\n\nBut why are the other cars provided? Maybe to distract? Or did I misread the starting row? The player is at (0,8) and the goal is (0,9). So we are one step away.\n\nBut note: the freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The goal is at y=9, which is not a freeway. So we don't have to worry about cars at y=9.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut let me check the car movements for row8 at turn13 and then at turn14? We don't need to for our safety because we are only on row8 at turn13 and row9 at turn14. However, just to be sure, let's compute the car positions at turn13 and turn14.\n\nAt turn13 (t1=13, so T-t1=0 for turn13 and 1 for turn14).\n\nFor row8, first car: (30,19,right,6) at turn13: [19,30]. At turn14: \n  It moves right by 6: [19+6, 30+6] = [25,36]. So 0 is not in [25,36].\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,6) at turn13: [-47,-36]. At turn14: [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30]. 0 is not in [-41,-30].\n\nSo even if we were on row8 at turn14, we would be safe? But we are not. So no issue.\n\nBut what about the other rows? We don't step on them. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We were on row8 at turn13 and we are safe. Then at turn14 we are on row9 (not a freeway) so we are safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nHowever, let me check the other rows because the problem might be that we have to avoid being hit on row8 at turn13, which we did.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the player is at (0,8) at turn13. We are taking action U at turn13, which moves the player to row9 at turn14. So we are never on row8 at turn14? So we don't need to check row8 at turn14.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAt turn13: we are on row8 (freeway) -> check row8: safe.\nAt turn14: we are on row9 -> not a freeway -> no collision possible.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut what if we had to go through multiple rows? In this case, we are only one step away.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 1.\n\nBut let me see the car state for row6 and row7? They have multiple cars. But we are not stepping on them.\n\nAlternatively, is there a reason we cannot go up? For example, if at turn13 there was a car on row8 covering 0? But we checked and there isn't.\n\nSo I think it's straightforward.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and we found H=1.\n\nBut wait, the goal is to reach (0,9) and we start at (0,8). So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". For H=1, we have one action at t=0 (which is turn13).\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player is at row 8 at turn 13. To reach row 9, an \"up\" (U) action is required.\n- At turn 13, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 13 are:\n  - Car 1: head = 30, tail = 19, direction = right, speed = 6 → span = [19, 30] (since tail < head for right-moving cars).\n  - Car 2: head = -36, tail = -47, direction = right, speed = 6 → span = [-47, -36].\n- The x-coordinate 0 is not in [19, 30] or [-47, -36], so no collision occurs at turn 13.\n- When the player takes action U at turn 13:\n  - At turn 13, the player is still on row 8 (safe, as verified).\n  - At turn 14, the player moves to row 9. Row 9 is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no car collision is possible.\n- The player reaches (0, 9) at turn 14, achieving the goal in one action.\n\n### Minimal Solution:\n- \\(H = 1\\) turn (one action starting at turn 13).\n- Action sequence: U at turn 13.\n\n### Verification for Turn 14 (for completeness, though not required for collision):\n- Cars on freeway 8 at turn 14 (after moving right by speed × 1 = 6 units):\n  - Car 1: [19 + 6, 30 + 6] = [25, 36] → 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: [-47 + 6, -36 + 6] = [-41, -30] → 0 not in span.\n- Even if the player were on row 8 at turn 14 (which they are not), it would be safe. However, the player is on row 9, so no issue.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is a single action.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\n}",
