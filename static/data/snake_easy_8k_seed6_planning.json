        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, meaning 8 units wide and 8 high. Cells like (0,0), (0,1), ..., (7,7). But walls are at these borders, so snake can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n\nSnake positions: only one segment? [(3,3)]. That means the snake is just a single cell at (3,3). Since it's the head and no body, it's length 1.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So it's facing left.\n\nFood: three pieces:\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll are positive food since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n\nSince the snake is only one cell, there's no body to worry about. Also, tail reward danger isn't an issue yet because there's no tail adjacent or anything.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, possible moves: since head direction is L (left), I can move left, up, or down, but not right because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: L (continue left), U (up), or D (down).\n\nNow, let's see the grid. Walls at borders, so:\n\n- Left from (3,3): x=3, y=3. Move L to (2,3). Is (2,3) a wall? x=2 is between 0 and 7, y=3, so not border. Internal obstacle is at (3,2), which is below, not (2,3). So (2,3) should be free.\n\n- Up from (3,3) to (3,4). y=4, which is fine, not y=0 or y=7? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=4 is between 0 and 7, so ok.\n\n- Down from (3,3) to (3,2). But (3,2) is an internal obstacle! So I cannot move down to (3,2) because it's a wall.\n\nInternal obstacles are walls, so (3,2) is occupied by a wall, so moving down to (3,2) would cause a wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (2,3) or up to (3,4) should be safe, but I need to check for food and plan ahead.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,4) - that's left and up a bit? From (3,3), (1,4) is two left and one up? x from 3 to 1 is left two, y from 3 to 4 is up one. So not adjacent.\n\n- (1,2) - x=1, y=2. From (3,3), that's two left and one down? y=2 is down from y=3? y=3 to y=2 is down, yes.\n\n- (6,6) - far away, right and up.\n\nSince snake is at (3,3), head direction L.\n\nPossible actions this turn: U, D, L, but D is to (3,2) which is wall, so not possible. So only U or L are possible? What about R? R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R. And D is wall, so indeed, only U or L.\n\nMove U: to (3,4)\n\nMove L: to (2,3)\n\nNow, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid: 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,2).\n\nFree cells except walls.\n\nSnake: only head at (3,3), so after eating food, it will grow.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows immediately, I assume? The rules say for positive food, length +1, so when head moves to food cell, it eats and grows, so the new position becomes head, and tail stays or grows? Since it's growing, the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when it eats, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so length increases by one, but the tail doesn't move that turn? I need to clarify the movement.\n\nThe rules don't specify the growth mechanics explicitly, but it says: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food. And for movement, it says \"the tail will also move forward\" when not eating, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"**Food Mechanics**: - Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n\nAnd in movement: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nThis implies that normally, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell where tail was becomes empty, unless it eats food.\n\nWhen snake eats food, the head moves to food cell, consumes it, and since length increases, the tail does not move that turn, so the new segment is added at the position where the head was before moving? I think that's standard.\n\nSimilarly, if not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves to the next segment or something.\n\nBut in this case, since snake is length 1, it's different.\n\nCurrently, snake at (3,3), length 1.\n\nIf it moves to a cell without food, it moves to that cell, and since no growth, the tail also moves, but since it's only one segment, it just moves to the new position, so the snake is now at the new cell, length still 1.\n\nIf it moves to a food cell, it eats it, so head is at food cell, and it grows, so now snake has two segments: the new head at food position, and the previous position becomes the tail.\n\nFor example, if at (3,3), it moves to a food cell, say (2,3) if there was food, but currently no food at (2,3), so let's see.\n\nFood is at (1,4), (1,2), (6,6), none at (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nSo if I move to (2,3) or (3,4), no food, so snake moves to that cell, and since length 1, it's just at the new position.\n\nThen, on next turn, it can move from there.\n\nNow, I need to plan to eat food while avoiding dying.\n\nAlso, food has life span: 10 turns each, decreasing each turn, including current turn? The state says \"Current Turn: t1=0\", and food life span is 10, so after this turn, life span decreases to 9 for all, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nBut since t1=0, and life span 10, it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning on turn 10 it might still be there? Let's see.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, after the turn, it decreases by one, and when it reaches 0, it disappears, I think.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, life_span=10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, still present. After turn 1, 8, ..., after turn 9, it becomes 0, and then after that turn, it disappears, so on turn 10, it might not be there? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at the start of turn t, life_span is the remaining turns including t.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L or something? I need to be precise.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life_span L.\n\nAfter turn t, countdown decreases to L-1.\n\nIf L-1 > 0, it remains; if L-1 = 0, it disappears after turn t.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that at the beginning of each turn, the life_span is the number of turns it will last, including the current one. So after that turn, it decreases, and when life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor example, life_span=10 at turn 0: it will be present during turn 0, and after turn 0, life_span becomes 9. After turn 1, 8, ..., after turn 9, life_span becomes 0, and it disappears, so not present for turn 10.\n\nSo at turn k, for k from 0 to 9, the food is present, and on turn 10, it is gone.\n\nSimilarly here, all food has life_span 10 at turn 0, so they will disappear after turn 9, so available for 10 turns.\n\nNow back to actions.\n\nCurrent turn t=0, snake at (3,3), head dir L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3). D to (3,2) is wall, R to (4,3) is opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nI need to think which one leads to better long-term survival and score.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving L to (2,3).\n\nAfter move L, snake moves to (2,3), no food, so snake now at (2,3), length 1, head dir L (since I moved left, new direction is L).\n\nNow, from (2,3), possible moves: L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3). But R is to (3,3), which is previous position, but since snake was only one segment, (3,3) is now empty, so moving there is fine, but it's not a food cell.\n\nFood is at (1,4), (1,2), (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,3), (1,4) is left and up: from (2,3) to (1,4) is x-1, y+1, so not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y diff 1.\n\nTo reach (1,4), I need to go left to (1,3) then up to (1,4), or up to (2,4) then left to (1,4), etc.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is left and down: to (1,2) from (2,3) is left to (1,3) then down to (1,2), or down to (2,2) then left to (1,2).\n\nAlso, (6,6) is far.\n\nNow, if I move U at t=0 to (3,4).\n\nThen snake at (3,4), head dir U (since I moved up).\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nD to (3,3) is previous position, empty, fine.\n\nNow, food at (1,4) is at y=4, x=1, so from (3,4), (1,4) is left two, same y.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is down and left, (6,6) right and down? From (3,4) to (6,6) is x+3, y+2.\n\nI need to think about paths to food.\n\nBut I should consider risks.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can go for the closest food or something.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, avoid situations where I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, if I go towards (1,4) or (1,2), I might go near the wall or obstacle.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal wall at (3,2).\n\nSo cells: for example, (0,0) to (0,7) wall, (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (0,0) to (7,0) wall, (0,7) to (7,7) wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so for any x, y=0 or y=7 is wall.\n\nSimilarly x=0 or x=7 for any y is wall.\n\nSo the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (3,2), which is within, so (3,2) is wall.\n\nSo free cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except (3,2).\n\nx from 1 to 6 inclusive, y from 1 to 6 inclusive, minus (3,2).\n\nSo 6x6 = 36 cells, minus 1 for obstacle, 35 free cells? But walls take multiple cells, but borders are all walls, so interior is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, 36 cells, minus (3,2) which is wall, so 35 free cells.\n\nSnake is at (3,3), so 34 empty now.\n\nFood at (1,4), (1,2), (6,6).\n\n(1,4) is at x=1,y=4, which is left border but x=1 is not wall, only x=0 is wall. Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are free, except y borders.\n\ny=1 to y=6 free except borders.\n\n(1,4): x=1, y=4, since x=1 >0 and x=1<7, y=4>0 and y=4<7, so not border, and not obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly (1,2): x=1,y=2, free.\n\n(6,6): x=6,y=6, free.\n\nNow, from snake (3,3), to (1,4): Manhattan distance |3-1| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 cells away? But not direct, since diagonal not possible.\n\nTo reach (1,4), I need at least 2 moves: e.g., left to (2,3) then up to (2,4)? (2,4) then left to (1,4).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (1,4): one way: left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then up to (1,4) — 3 moves, but (1,3) is a cell, then to (1,4).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) is one move left, then from (2,3) to (1,3) is another left, then from (1,3) to (1,4) is up. So three moves to reach (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is food, so if I go directly, on turn 2 I could eat it if I go that way.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3) to (1,2): |3-1| + |3-2| =2+1=3, e.g., left to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then left to (1,2) — but (2,2) is free? y=2, x=2, 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, not (3,2), so (2,2) is free.\n\nThen to (1,2).\n\nOr directly from (3,3) down to (3,2) but (3,2) is wall, not possible.\n\nSo only via other paths.\n\n(6,6) is far: |3-6| + |3-6| =3+3=6 moves min.\n\nNow, back to decision at t=0.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3)\n\nThen snake at (2,3), head dir L.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (1,3) by moving L, or to (2,4) U, or (2,2) D, or (3,3) R.\n\n(3,3) is empty, so ok.\n\nNow, food at (1,4) is close: from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), then L to (1,4) to eat on turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,2): from (2,3), D to (2,2), then L to (1,2) to eat on turn 2.\n\nBut I can only do one.\n\nIf I go to (2,4) on turn 1 (if I move U from (2,3)), then to (1,4) on turn 2.\n\nOr from (2,3) to (1,3) on turn 1, then to (1,4) on turn 2 or to (1,2) on turn 2.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go U to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) and (1,4) are both food.\n\nAlso, there is (6,6) but far.\n\nNow, Option 2: at t=0 move U to (3,4)\n\nThen snake at (3,4), head dir U.\n\nFrom here, food at (1,4) is at same y=4, x=1.\n\nSo I can go L to (2,4), then L to (1,4) to eat on turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4) I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nSince the snake is short, no body collision risk yet.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,4), it's near the wall at x=1, which is not wall but close to x=0 wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) near y=1 and x=1.\n\nBut since I can move around, it should be ok for now.\n\nBut let's consider the internal obstacle at (3,2), which blocks the down direction from (3,3).\n\nAlso, the food at (1,2) and (1,4) have life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\n(6,6) also.\n\nBut I should prioritize eating food to grow, so that I can survive longer.\n\nWith longer body, I need to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nBut for now, length 1, no issue.\n\nLet's simulate both options 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, suppose at t=0 I move L to (2,3).\n\nThen t=1: snake at (2,3), head dir L.\n\nNow from here, I need to decide move for t=1.\n\nBut I have to think ahead for the AI's actions.\n\nSince I'm the AI, I need to choose a sequence for the next few turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for turns t=0, t=1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output is actions for multiple turns? The answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1\n...\n}\n\nAnd it says \"where each action\", so I need to output actions for several turns, but how many? It doesn't specify, but since it says think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut the state might change after each action, especially if I eat food.\n\nSo I need to output a sequence based on the current state, but since no other agents, the food life span decreases, but I can predict.\n\nAlso, when I eat food, new food might spawn? The rules don't say anything about new food spawning. Only the given food is present, and it disappears when life span ends.\n\nNo mention of new food, so only these three food items for now, until eaten or expired.\n\nSo I need to eat them before they expire.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat all three if possible.\n\nBut with the snake, I need to grow and avoid trapping myself.\n\nFirst, let's list the positions.\n\nI am considering going for (1,4) or (1,2) first, since closer.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (1,3) or (2,4) or (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then from there I can eat (1,4) or (1,2) on next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,4), I can go to (1,4) next.\n\nOr to (2,2), then to (1,2).\n\nBut let's see the grid around.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,2) might block some paths.\n\nNow, another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently, no tail, so not an issue.\n\nEven when I have tail, as long as I don't eat food when head is adjacent to tail and the food is under tail, but it's complicated.\n\nFor now, not a problem.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nOption A: Move L at t=0 to (2,3)\n\nThen at t=1, I can move U to (2,4)\n\nThen at t=2, move L to (1,4) and eat food. Now snake grows to length 2: head at (1,4), tail at (2,4)? Let's see.\n\nAt t=0, start (3,3), move L to (2,3), snake at (2,3), length 1.\n\nt=1, move U to (2,4), no food at (2,4), so snake moves to (2,4), still length 1.\n\nt=2, move L to (1,4), now (1,4) has food, so eat it, head at (1,4), and since growth, tail remains at previous position? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, and new segment added at previous head position, so body grows.\n\nAt t=1, snake at (2,4).\n\nAfter move to (1,4) and eat, head at (1,4), and the previous position (2,4) becomes tail segment. So snake positions: head (1,4), tail (2,4), length 2.\n\nHead direction after move L, so dir L.\n\nNow, from here, I can move U, D, L, but L to (0,4) is wall, since x=0 is wall, so cannot move L. Possible: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), or R to (2,4) but (2,4) is tail, so if I move R to (2,4), head touches body, collision, death.\n\nSo cannot move R.\n\nU to (1,5): y=5, not wall, free.\n\nD to (1,3): y=3, x=1, free cell.\n\nAlso, since head dir L, moving R is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nCurrent head dir L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo possible: U, D, or L but L is wall, so only U or D.\n\nNow, food available: (1,2) at (1,2), and (6,6).\n\n(1,2) is down from here.\n\nFrom (1,4), move D to (1,3), then D to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut at (1,3), no food, so when I move to (1,3), snake: head to (1,3), tail moves to (1,4)? Let's see.\n\nAfter eating at (1,4), snake: head (1,4), tail (2,4).\n\nt=3: move D to (1,3). No food at (1,3), so head moves to (1,3), tail moves to (1,4). Now snake: head (1,3), tail (1,4).\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen t=4: move D to (1,2), which has food, eat it, so head to (1,2), grow, new tail added, so body: head (1,2), then (1,3), then (1,4)? When eat at (1,2), head moves to (1,2), and since growth, the tail does not move, so segments: head (1,2), and previous head (1,3) becomes body, and tail (1,4) remains, so positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)] length 3.\n\nHead dir D.\n\nNow, from (1,2), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nL to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2), U to (1,3) but (1,3) is body, collision, D to (1,1) but y=1, not wall, but D to (1,1).\n\ny=1 is not y=0, so (1,1) is free, I think.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=1 is free.\n\nSimilarly, R to (2,2) is free.\n\nBut U to (1,3) is body, death.\n\nL to (0,2) wall.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nHead dir D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed? Current head direction is D, so moving U would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo cannot move U anyway.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nMove D to (1,1): then head at (1,1), tail at (1,2), body (1,3)? After move to (1,1), no eat, so head to (1,1), tail to (1,3)? Snake positions: before move, head (1,2), body (1,3), tail (1,4).\n\nAfter moving D to (1,1), head to (1,1), then the body segments follow: the first body segment (1,3) moves to the previous head position (1,2)? Standard snake movement: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: before move, indices: 0: head (1,2), 1: (1,3), 2: tail (1,4).\n\nAfter head moves to (1,1), new head (1,1), then segment 1 moves to where head was, (1,2), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (1,3). So new positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (2,2), head to (2,2), then body to (1,2), tail to (1,3).\n\nNow, from (1,2), if I move D to (1,1), then at (1,1), I can move D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, or L to (0,1) wall, or R to (2,1), or U to (1,2) but (1,2) is now body? After moving to (1,1), positions head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3).\n\nSo from (1,1), move U to (1,2) but (1,2) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nMove L to (0,1) wall.\n\nMove D to (1,0) wall.\n\nMove R to (2,1).\n\nSo only possible move R to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, if at (1,2) I had moved R to (2,2), then from there, etc.\n\nBut in this case, after eating both (1,4) and (1,2), I am at (1,2) with body above, and I can only go down to (1,1) or right to (2,2), but (1,1) is a corner, and from there only right to (2,1), so I might be trapped in the bottom-left area.\n\nThen to reach (6,6), I have to go through the grid, but with body, it might be risky.\n\nLet's see the other option.\n\nBack to t=0, if I move U to (3,4).\n\nt=0: move U to (3,4), snake at (3,4), head dir U.\n\nThen t=1, I can move to (1,4) directly? From (3,4), move L to (2,4), no food, so snake at (2,4), length 1.\n\nt=2, move L to (1,4), eat food, grow to length 2: head (1,4), tail (2,4).\n\nNow same as before, at (1,4), can only move U or D, since L wall, R to tail not allowed.\n\nU to (1,5) or D to (1,3).\n\nSay move U to (1,5), then head at (1,5), tail at (1,4)? After move to (1,5), no eat, so head to (1,5), tail to (2,4)? Positions: before move, head (1,4), tail (2,4).\n\nAfter move U to (1,5), head to (1,5), tail moves to (1,4). So snake: head (1,5), tail (1,4).\n\nHead dir U.\n\nThen from (1,5), can move U to (1,6), D to (1,4) but (1,4) is tail, collision, L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5).\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nU to (1,6): y=6, not y=7, so free, but y=6 is border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, so (1,6) free.\n\nBut moving U to (1,6) is towards y=7 wall.\n\nThen from there, only D or R, but D to (1,5) might be body later.\n\nI need to go to (1,2) or something.\n\nTo eat (1,2), from (1,4), I could move D to (1,3) then to (1,2).\n\nBut in this path, at (1,4), I move D to (1,3).\n\nt=3: from (1,4) move D to (1,3), no food, so head to (1,3), tail to (1,4)? Positions: head (1,3), tail (1,4).\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen t=4: move D to (1,2), eat food, grow to length 3: head (1,2), body (1,3), tail (1,4).\n\nThen same as before, stuck in bottom-left with body above.\n\nNot good for long-term.\n\nFrom (1,4), instead of going down, I could go up, but then (1,2) might expire or I can come back, but with body, it's harder.\n\nLife span is 10, so I have time, but the area might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (6,6) first or something.\n\nBut (6,6) is far, and by the time I reach, other food might expire, but life span 10, from turn 0, I can reach in 6 moves min, but with eating, it might take longer.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (6,6): one path: R to (4,3), R to (5,3), R to (6,3), then U to (6,4), U to (6,5), U to (6,6), 6 moves, but I can go diagonally in a way, but not diagonal moves, so min 6 moves.\n\nBut at t=0, I can only move U or L, not R, because head dir L, cannot move opposite.\n\nAt t=0, head dir L, so I cannot move R directly; I need to change direction first.\n\nFor example, move U at t=0 to (3,4), then from there I can move R to (4,4) at t=1, etc.\n\nOr move L to (2,3), then from there I can move R to (3,3) or other.\n\nBut let's think about the center or open area.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,2) blocks the bottom-center.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, I should keep the snake flexible, not go to corners early.\n\nSo perhaps at t=0, moving U to (3,4) is better because it's more central, while (2,3) is left.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (2,4) or (4,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nFood at (1,4) is west, (1,2) south-west, (6,6) east-south.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go towards (6,6) or towards (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is closer.\n\n| (3,4) to (1,4) | = 2 in x, same y, so 2 moves: L to (2,4), L to (1,4).\n\nSimilarly to (1,2): |dx| + |dy| =2+2=4 moves min.\n\nTo (6,6): 3+2=5 moves min.\n\nBut with head dir U, from (3,4), I can move L to (2,4) at t=1, then L to (1,4) at t=2 to eat.\n\nBut then I am at (1,4) with body, as before.\n\nTo avoid being trapped, after eating (1,4), instead of going down, I could go up to (1,5), then right to (2,5), etc., to explore the grid.\n\nBut I have to eat (1,2) and (6,6).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is near the bottom-left.\n\nSince there is an obstacle at (3,2), it might be harder to access (1,2) from the right.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I could have gone down, but (3,2) is wall, so I need to go around.\n\nPaths to (1,2): from (3,3), I can go left to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then left to (1,2).\n\nOr from (2,3) to (1,3) then down to (1,2).\n\n etc.\n\nBut from (1,4) or other places.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (6,6) first, since it's in the open, and then come back for the others.\n\nBut (1,2) and (1,4) are closer, but in corners.\n\nLet's calculate the turns.\n\nAt t=0, if I move U to (3,4).\n\nt=1: move R to (4,4)  for example, to go towards (6,6).\n\nThen t=2: move R to (5,4)\n\nt=3: move R to (6,4)\n\nt=4: move U to (6,5)\n\nt=5: move U to (6,6) and eat.\n\nSo at t=5, eat (6,6).\n\nBut at t=5, life span of food: started at 10, each turn decreases, so at turn t, remaining life span is 10 - t.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, 9, after turn 1, 8, etc.\n\nSo at turn t, the life span is 10 - t for the food, since countdown includes current turn, but at the start of turn t, life span is the number of turns it will last, including t.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10, so it can be eaten on turn 0 to turn 9.\n\nOn turn 10, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,6), if I eat on turn 5, life span was 10 at turn 0, on turn 5, it has life span 5 (since 10-5=5? Let's see: at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, 9, after turn 1, 8, ..., after turn 4, 6, after turn 5, 5? No.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, the life span value is for that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, life span 10, so it is present and can be eaten during turn 0.\n\nAfter turn 0 is processed, life span decreases to 9 for turn 1.\n\nAt turn 1, life span 9, can be eaten.\n\n...\nAt turn 9, life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 9, life span 0, disappears, not present on turn 10.\n\nSo for (6,6), I can eat it as long as I reach by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nOn turn 5, I can eat (6,6), which is fine.\n\nBut in the mean time, (1,4) and (1,2) might be still there, but I can go back.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), I am at (6,6) with length 2 or more, but in this case, from t=0 to t=5, I moved to (6,6) without eating other food, so snake length still 1 until t=5 when I eat.\n\nAt t=0: move U to (3,4), no eat, length 1.\n\nt=1: move R to (4,4), no eat, length 1.\n\nt=2: move R to (5,4), no eat, length 1.\n\nt=3: move R to (6,4), no eat, length 1.\n\nt=4: move U to (6,5), no eat, length 1.\n\nt=5: move U to (6,6), eat, length 2, head (6,6), tail (6,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go to eat (1,4) or (1,2), but they are far, and life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 5, life span of (1,4) is 10 - 5 = 5? At turn 5, life span is 5, so it will disappear after turn 9, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (1,4): |6-1| + |6-4| =5+2=7 moves min, so I can reach by turn 12, but turn 12 is too late, since on turn 10 it disappears? Turn 9 is the last to eat.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 is 4 turns, but I need at least 7 moves, so I cannot reach (1,4) from (6,6) in 4 moves; min 5 in x and 2 in y, but since not direct, more.\n\nFor example from (6,6) to (1,4): go left to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), then down to (1,5), (1,4), but (1,6) to (1,4) is two down, but y from 6 to 4, down to (1,5) then (1,4).\n\nSo 6 moves: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — 7 cells, 6 moves from (6,6).\n\n(6,6) to (5,6) move L, (4,6) move L, (3,6) move L, (2,6) move L, (1,6) move L, then (1,5) move D, (1,4) move D, but that's two moves to (1,4) from (1,6), so from (6,6) to (1,6) 5 moves, then to (1,5) 6th move, to (1,4) 7th move. 7 moves to reach (1,4).\n\nFrom turn 5, on turn 5 I am at (6,6), so turns 6,7,8,9: 4 turns to move, I can make 4 moves, reach only to, say, (2,6) or something, not to (1,4).\n\nFor example, turn 6: from (6,6) move L to (5,6), turn 7: L to (4,6), turn 8: L to (3,6), turn 9: L to (2,6), but (2,6) not food, and (1,4) not reached. On turn 9 I can be at (2,6), then if I move to (1,6) or down, but not to (1,4).\n\nCannot reach (1,4) by turn 9 from (6,6) in 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly for (1,2), even farther.\n\nSo if I go to (6,6) first, I might miss (1,4) and (1,2), since they expire after turn 9.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 is 4 moves, but I need to start earlier.\n\nAt turn 0, if I go directly to (1,4), I can eat on turn 2, then (1,2) on turn 4, then I have time to go to (6,6).\n\nFor example, after eating (1,2) on turn 4, at (1,2) with length 3, as earlier.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (1,2) to (6,6): min |6-1| + |6-2| =5+4=9 moves.\n\nOn turn 4, after eating, I am at (1,2).\n\nLife span of (6,6) at turn 4: life span 6 (10-4=6), so can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn 9, 5 moves? Turns: turn 4 I just ate, so positions at start of turn.\n\nTurn 4: after eating (1,2), snake at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nNow turn 4: I need to move from (1,2).\n\nAs before, possible moves D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nSay move R to (2,2).\n\nThen head to (2,2), body to (1,2), tail to (1,3)? Positions: before move, head (1,2), body (1,3), tail (1,4).\n\nAfter move R to (2,2), head to (2,2), body moves to (1,2), tail moves to (1,3). So snake: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is wall, D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, collision.\n\nCurrent head dir R, so moving L opposite not allowed.\n\nSo possible U to (2,3), D to (2,1), R to (3,2) wall, so only U or D.\n\nMove U to (2,3).\n\nThen head to (2,3), body to (2,2), tail to (1,2)? After move, head (2,3), body (2,2), tail (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is position, but (1,3) was tail, moved to where body was? Standard: tail moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nAfter move U to (2,3), head to (2,3), the first body segment (which was at (1,2)) moves to previous head position (2,2)? Let's index.\n\nBefore move: segment 0: head (2,2), segment 1: (1,2), segment 2: tail (1,3).\n\nAfter move head to (2,3), then segment 1 moves to where head was, (2,2), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (1,2). So positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), tail (1,2).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to (2,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (6,6).\n\nThis will take many turns, and by turn 9, I might not reach.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (6,6) min 4+3=7 moves, but with body, it might take longer if I need to avoid self-collision.\n\nOn turn 4, if at (1,2), I move D to (1,1), then only move R to (2,1), then from (2,1) move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1), etc., still slow.\n\nSo it might be tight to reach (6,6) by turn 9.\n\nLife span at turn 4 is 6 for (6,6), so from turn 4 to turn 9, 5 moves, but I need more than 5 moves to reach from (1,2) to (6,6), so I might miss it.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (6,6) first or earlier.\n\nBut at the beginning, I can't go directly to (6,6) because of direction constraint.\n\nAt t=0, head dir L, so I must move U or L, not R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then I can start going right.\n\nBut if I go to (3,4) at t=0, then at t=1 I can move R to (4,4), and so on to (6,6) by t=5 as before.\n\nBut then (1,4) and (1,2) will expire before I can eat them, as I calculated earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, if I eat (1,4) and (1,2) first, I might not reach (6,6) in time.\n\nSo I need a balanced approach or eat (6,6) first.\n\nBut (6,6) has the same life span, and it's farther, so if I eat it later, it might be ok, but from the corner, it's hard to reach.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (1,4) quickly, then from there go towards (6,6) without eating (1,2), but (1,2) is also food, I should eat it if possible.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, move U to (3,4), then t=1 move L to (2,4), t=2 move L to (1,4) and eat, now at (1,4) with tail at (2,4), length 2.\n\nThen instead of going down, I go up to (1,5) at t=3, then right to (2,5) at t=4, then to (3,5), etc., towards (6,6).\n\nBut (1,2) is still there, and I can eat it later if I come back, but it's in the opposite direction.\n\nFrom (1,4) after eating, move U to (1,5) at t=3.\n\nThen at (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nSay move R to (2,5), head to (2,5), tail to (1,5)? After move, head (2,5), tail (1,4)? Positions: before move, head (1,4), tail (2,4)? At t=2 after eating, head (1,4), tail (2,4).\n\nt=3: move U to (1,5)? But I said move U from (1,4) to (1,5), but (1,5) is above, so move U to (1,5), no food, so head to (1,5), tail moves to (1,4). So snake: head (1,5), tail (1,4).\n\nThen t=4: move R to (2,5), head to (2,5), tail to (1,5). So head (2,5), tail (1,5).\n\nThen t=5: move R to (3,5), and so on.\n\nBut (1,2) is at (1,2), which is below, and I am going up, so I might not eat it.\n\nLife span of (1,2) at turn 5 is 5, so until turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,5) or where I am, to (1,2) is far, min |3-1| + |5-2| =2+3=5 moves, but with body, it might take more, and I have to go down, which might be blocked by the body or obstacle.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), but (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt this point, cells are free, but the body is behind.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (1,2) and only eat (1,4) and (6,6), but that means missing one food, score only 2 instead of 3.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so I should try to eat all three.\n\nSo I need a path that allows eating all.\n\nLet's start from (3,3) and go towards (1,2) first, but I can't directly because down is wall.\n\nAt t=0, move L to (2,3).\n\nThen at t=1, move D to (2,2) (assuming (2,2) is free).\n\n(2,2) is free, yes.\n\nThen at t=2, move L to (1,2) and eat. Now snake at (1,2) with tail at (2,2), length 2.\n\nHead dir L.\n\nFrom (1,2), can move U to (1,3), D to (1,1), R to (2,2) but (2,2) is tail, collision, L to (0,2) wall.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nMove U to (1,3), no food, head to (1,3), tail to (1,2).\n\nThen t=3: move U to (1,4) and eat, grow to length 3: head (1,4), body (1,3), tail (1,2).\n\nNow same as before, stuck.\n\nFrom (1,2), after eating, move D to (1,1), then only R to (2,1), etc.\n\nThen I can go right.\n\nBut to eat (6,6), from (1,1) or (2,1), it takes many moves.\n\nAnd (6,6) life span, at turn 2 I ate (1,2), so turn 2, life span of (6,6) is 8, so until turn 10? At turn 2, life span 8, can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 9, 7 moves, min to (6,6) from (1,2) is 5+4=9 moves, so possible if I go directly.\n\nFor example from (1,2) after eating at t=2, snake head (1,2), tail (2,2).\n\nt=3: move R to (2,2) but (2,2) is tail, collision, so not possible. From (1,2), I can move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nSay move U to (1,3), then as above.\n\nMove D to (1,1), head to (1,1), tail to (1,2).\n\nThen t=4: move R to (2,1), head to (2,1), tail to (1,1).\n\nt=5: move U to (2,2), head to (2,2), tail to (2,1).\n\nt=6: move U to (2,3), head to (2,3), tail to (2,2).\n\nt=7: move R to (3,3), but (3,3) is free, head to (3,3), tail to (2,3).\n\nt=8: move R to (4,3), head to (4,3), tail to (3,3).\n\nt=9: move R to (5,3), head to (5,3), tail to (4,3).\n\nBut (5,3) not (6,6), and I need to go to (6,6), so on turn 9 I am at (5,3), not at food, and (6,6) is at (6,6), I can move to (6,3) then up, but on turn 10 it disappears, so I miss it.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, the best way is to eat (6,6) first, but I can't at t=0.\n\nSo at t=0, move U to (3,4) to enable going right.\n\nThen go directly to (6,6) and eat on turn 5, as before.\n\nThen (1,4) and (1,2) will expire, but I can eat one of them if I start earlier.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) at t=1, instead of going right, I go left to (2,4), then to (1,4) on t=2, eat, then from there go right as fast as possible.\n\nBut after eating (1,4) at t=2, snake at (1,4), tail (2,4), length 2.\n\nt=3: move U to (1,5), head to (1,5), tail to (1,4).\n\nt=4: move R to (2,5), head to (2,5), tail to (1,5).\n\nt=5: move R to (3,5), head to (3,5), tail to (2,5).\n\nt=6: move R to (4,5), head to (4,5), tail to (3,5).\n\nt=7: move R to (5,5), head to (5,5), tail to (4,5).\n\nt=8: move R to (6,5), head to (6,5), tail to (5,5).\n\nt=9: move U to (6,6), eat (6,6), grow to length 3: head (6,6), body (6,5), tail (5,5).\n\nAnd (1,2) is not eaten, but I ate two foods.\n\nLife span of (1,2): at turn 2, when I ate (1,4), life span of (1,2) is 8, so until turn 9.\n\nBut I didn't go to eat it, so it expires.\n\nScore 2.\n\nIf I try to eat (1,2) after (1,4), it would take more time and I might miss (6,6).\n\nSo with this, I can get score 2.\n\nBut perhaps I can eat (1,2) first.\n\nAt t=0, move L to (2,3).\n\nt=1: move D to (2,2).\n\nt=2: move L to (1,2) and eat, snake at (1,2), tail (2,2), length 2.\n\nt=3: move U to (1,3), no food, head to (1,3), tail to (1,2).\n\nt=4: move U to (1,4) and eat, grow to length 3: head (1,4), body (1,3), tail (1,2).\n\nThen from here, to go to (6,6), as before, min 9 moves, but on turn 4, life span of (6,6) is 6, so until turn 9, 5 moves left, not enough, so miss (6,6).\n\nScore 2.\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo maximum score is 2, by eating either the two left foods or one left and (6,6).\n\nBut with eating (6,6) and one left, I can get 2.\n\nOr perhaps there's a way to eat all three.\n\nFor example, if I eat (6,6) quickly, then go to (1,4) or (1,2).\n\nBut from (6,6) to (1,4) takes 7 moves, and after eating (6,6) on turn 5, life span of (1,4) is 5, so until turn 9, 4 moves, not enough.\n\nUnless I eat (1,4) before going to (6,6).\n\nBut I can't do both quickly from start.\n\nAt t=0, move U to (3,4).\n\nt=1: move L to (2,4).\n\nt=2: move L to (1,4) and eat, now at (1,4), tail (2,4).\n\nt=3: move R to (2,4) but (2,4) is tail, collision, so cannot. Only U or D.\n\nMove U to (1,5).\n\nt=4: move R to (2,5).\n\nt=5: move R to (3,5).\n\nt=6: move R to (4,5).\n\nt=7: move R to (5,5).\n\nt=8: move R to (6,5).\n\nt=9: move U to (6,6) and eat.\n\nAnd (1,2) not eaten.\n\nScore 2.\n\nIf from (1,4) after eating, I move D to (1,3) on t=3, then to (1,2) on t=4 to eat, then from (1,2) I can't reach (6,6) in time.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat all three within the life span with the starting position.\n\nTherefore, I should aim to eat two of them, and since (6,6) is in the open, it might be better for long-term survival to eat it and one other.\n\nBut for now, at t=0, I need to choose U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I can then go to (1,4) or (1,2) quickly.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), I can go to (1,4) quickly or start going to (6,6).\n\nFor long-term survival, after eating, being in the center is better than in the corner.\n\nSo perhaps eating (6,6) first and then moving around is better.\n\nBut I can't eat it first from start.\n\nSo at t=0, move U to (3,4) to go towards center and enable going right.\n\nThen at t=1, move R to (4,4).\n\nt=2, move R to (5,4).\n\nt=3, move R to (6,4).\n\nt=4, move U to (6,5).\n\nt=5, move U to (6,6) and eat.\n\nThen from there, I can explore the grid, but no other food, so I just survive as long as possible, but no more food, so score 1.\n\nBut there are other foods, but they expire soon.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), on turn 5, (1,4) and (1,2) have life span 5, so until turn 9, but I can't reach them, so I don't eat them.\n\nScore 1.\n\nBut if I eat one of the left foods, I can get score 1 or 2.\n\nEarlier with eating (1,4) and (6,6), I can get score 2, as in the path above.\n\nIn the path where I eat (1,4) on t=2, then go to (6,6) on t=9, I eat both, score 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (1,2) first, I can eat (1,4) and then not (6,6), or only one.\n\nBut eating (1,4) and (6,6) is possible for score 2.\n\nEating (1,2) and (1,4) is also score 2, but then I am in corner with body, might die soon.\n\nWhereas after eating (6,6), I am in open.\n\nSo for long-term survival, eating (6,6) is better.\n\nBut to eat (6,6) and one other, I need to eat one of the left foods first quickly.\n\nSo let's go with that.\n\nAt t=0, move U to (3,4).\n\nThen t=1: move L to (2,4).\n\nt=2: move L to (1,4) and eat. Snake: head (1,4), tail (2,4).\n\nThen t=3: move U to (1,5)  (since I can't move R or L easily)\n\nt=4: move R to (2,5)\n\nt=5: move R to (3,5)\n\nt=6: move R to (4,5)\n\nt=7: move R to (5,5)\n\nt=8: move R to (6,5)\n\nt=9: move U to (6,6) and eat.\n\nOn t=9, I eat (6,6), and (1,2) expires unused.\n\nScore 2.\n\nIf at t=3 from (1,4), I move D to (1,3), then t=4 move D to (1,2) and eat, then I have body, and can't reach (6,6) in time.\n\nSo better to go up and right.\n\nFor the sequence, at t=0, move U.\n\nThen the actions for future turns are based on the plan.\n\nBut since I need to output a sequence, I can output for turns 0 to 9 or something.\n\nBut the answer format is for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since I think 5+ turns ahead, I can output 5 turns or more.\n\nFor this case, I can output from turn 0 to turn 2 or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0 only, but the output has multiple turns.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, move L to (2,3).\n\nThen t=1: move U to (2,4)\n\nt=2: move L to (1,4) and eat.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can go to (1,3) then to (1,4) or (1,2).\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think moving U at t=0 is better because it allows more flexibility.\n\nSo I'll go with U at t=0.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can plan the next few moves.\n\nBut to be precise, let's output for turns 0,1,2.\n\nAt t=0, move U to (3,4)\n\nThen at t=1, move L to (2,4)\n\nAt t=2, move L to (1,4) and eat.\n\nThen for later turns, I can go up and right as above.\n\nBut for the answer, I think I need to output only the actions for the requested turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output for 5 turns or so.\n\nThe current turn is t1=0, so output actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4 or something.\n\nLet's see the core rules: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but for the answer, it's a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output a sequence of 5 actions.\n\nBut after each action, the state changes, so it's based on the initial state.\n\nSince no randomness, I can predict.\n\nSo for turn 0: move U\n\nTurn 1: move L (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 2: move L (to (1,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 3: move U (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 4: move R (to (2,5))\n\netc.\n\nBut for the box, I think output for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps the AI should decide the first action, and the sequence is for the plan.\n\nBut the format says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, etc.\"\n\nSo I'll output for turn 0 to turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut at turn 2, I eat food, so the snake grows, but for the actions, it's fine.\n\nTo maximize survival, after eating, I should avoid the walls.\n\nBut for now, I think it's ok.\n\nAnother option: don't eat the corner food, go directly to (6,6) and survive long with no food, but score only 1, worse than 2.\n\nSo better to eat two.\n\nTherefore, at t=0, move U.\n\nThen the sequence can be U, L, L for the first three turns to eat (1,4).\n\nThen from there, go U then R etc.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output 5 turns.\n\nBut let's see the head direction for future moves.\n\nAt t=0, move U, new head dir U.\n\nt=1, move L, new head dir L.\n\nt=2, move L, new head dir L.\n\nThen t=3, move U, new head dir U.\n\nt=4, move R, new head dir R.\n\nAll valid, no instant reverse.\n\nAnd positions are free.\n\nSo for the box:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: L\nTurn 2: L\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: R\n}\n\nBut this is for the first 5 turns.\n\nAt turn 4, I am at (2,5), heading to (6,6).\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo make it shorter, but 5 turns are good.\n\nSince the snake is short, no risk yet.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I must consider the current state and plan at least 5 turns ahead. The snake starts at position (3,3) with head direction left (L). The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,2). Available food includes (1,4) with value +1 and life span 10, (1,2) with value +1 and life span 10, and (6,6) with value +1 and life span 10. All food is positive, and there are no immediate risks since the snake is length 1.\n\n### Key Considerations for Planning:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 0)**: The current head direction is L, so instant reverse (R) is not allowed. Moving down (D) to (3,2) is impossible due to the wall. Thus, only up (U) or left (L) are valid moves.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (1,4) and (1,2) are closer (Manhattan distance 3) but in the corner, which may lead to trapping risks after eating.\n  - (6,6) is farther (Manhattan distance 6) but in an open area, better for long-term movement and survival.\n  - Life spans are 10, so all food must be eaten by turn 9 to avoid expiration. However, eating all three is impractical due to distance and time constraints. Aiming for two foods (e.g., (1,4) and (6,6)) yields a score of +2, better than eating only one or risking death in corners.\n- **Path to Maximize Score and Survival**: \n  - Eating (1,4) quickly (by turn 2) allows moving toward (6,6) immediately after. This avoids the risk of missing (6,6) due to life span.\n  - Starting with U at turn 0 positions the snake better for accessing both foods: (3,4) is more central than (2,3), enabling efficient movement to (6,6).\n  - After eating (1,4), moving up (U) then right (R) avoids the body and walls, creating a clear path to (6,6).\n- **Risks and Avoidance**: \n  - No body collision risks initially (snake length 1), but after growth, avoid moving into body or walls.\n  - (1,2) is skipped to ensure (6,6) is eaten before turn 10. Attempting to eat (1,2) would delay reaching (6,6), risking expiration.\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant here (no tail adjacent to food).\n- **5-Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 0**: Move U to (3,4) for better access to the right side and to avoid the left corner trap early.\n  - **Turn 1**: Move L to (2,4) to approach (1,4) efficiently.\n  - **Turn 2**: Move L to (1,4) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows to length 2; head at (1,4), tail at (2,4)).\n  - **Turn 3**: Move U to (1,5) to avoid the wall and body collision (moving R to tail is invalid), opening a path right.\n  - **Turn 4**: Move R to (2,5) to start moving toward (6,6), staying clear of walls.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats (1,4) on turn 2 and (6,6) can be eaten by turn 9 (as planned beyond turn 4), achieving score +2. (1,2) expires unused but is a necessary trade-off.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating (1,4), moving up and right avoids corners, reducing trapping risks. The path to (6,6) uses open areas for better maneuverability.\n- **Efficiency**: The sequence minimizes moves to food, with all actions valid (no instant reverse or wall collisions). By turn 4, the snake is at (2,5), ready to continue to (6,6) via R and U moves (e.g., turns 5-8: R to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5); turn 9: U to (6,6) to eat).\n- **Life Span Handling**: (1,4) eaten on turn 2 (life span 8 remaining, safe). (6,6) will be eaten on turn 9 (life span 1 remaining, safe). (1,2) expires after turn 9 but is unreachable without sacrificing (6,6).\n\n### Final Action Sequence (Turns 0 to 4):\nThe actions are based on the initial state, with movements planned to avoid risks and maximize score over 5+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: L\nTurn 2: L\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: R\n}",
