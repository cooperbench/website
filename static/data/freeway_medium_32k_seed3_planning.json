        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn t1 = 0, at position (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y_T (which is one of 1..8) and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: The player is not on a freeway until they have moved to it. So when moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is still on the old row (y) and then at turn T+1 they are on the new row (y+1). Therefore, when moving, we only check the current row at the current turn and the new row at the next turn? Actually, note the rule:\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, we are only concerned with the car on the current freeway (if we are on a freeway, i.e., y_T in [1,8]). When we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars.\n\nThe update for cars: \n  - Left-moving: span at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given state is at turn t1 (which is 0). So for a car given as (h, tau, d, s), at turn t1 (0) the span is [h, tau] for left? Actually, the table gives:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48,37,right,3) -> this is a right-moving car? But the representation: \n  For right-moving: they say \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" because they write: \n      Right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> Span(T)=[tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, they list: (head, tail, ...). So for a right-moving car, the head is the front? and tail is the back? Then the span at time t1 is [tail, head]? \n\nLooking at the example for freeway 5: \n  They have two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). \n\nBut note: the representation says for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> so for the first car: tau=37, h=48? Then the span at time t1 is [37,48]. Similarly, the second car: tau=-11, h=0 -> span at t1 is [-11,0].\n\nBut wait: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, y) at turn T and the car on freeway y has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n\nSo for freeway 5 at turn 0, the second car has span [-11,0] which covers 0? So if the player is on freeway 5 at turn 0, they would collide. However, we start at turn0 at y=0 (which is not a freeway) so no collision.\n\nBut note: we are going to move to freeways. We must avoid being on a freeway at a turn when there is a car covering 0.\n\nLet me write a function for a car: given a car (h, tau, d, s) and a time T (relative to t1=0, so T=0 is current turn), the span at time T is:\n\nIf d == 'right':\n    left_end = tau + s * T\n    right_end = h + s * T\n    span = [left_end, right_end]\n\nIf d == 'left':\n    left_end = h - s * T\n    right_end = tau - s * T\n    span = [left_end, right_end]\n\nBut note: in the problem, for left-moving they wrote: \n    [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nSo the initial span for left-moving is [h, tau] and then it moves left. So for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? and tail is the rightmost? \n\nBut in the table, all cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). And for freeway 1: (48,37,right,3) -> so if it's right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the back (leftmost). So the initial span for a right-moving car is [tail, head] = [37,48]. Then at time T, it becomes [37+3*T, 48+3*T].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car (if there were any) (h,tau,left,s): the initial span is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*T, tau - s*T].\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? \n  Freeway 1: right\n  Freeway 2: right\n  Freeway 3: right\n  Freeway 4: right\n  Freeway 5: two cars, both right\n  Freeway 6: two cars, both right\n  Freeway 7: two cars, both right\n  Freeway 8: two cars, both right\n\nSo we only need to handle right-moving cars.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn0. We can take actions: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y same). But note: y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: get to (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are going to simulate moves. Since we want minimal turns, we should try to go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nLet me list the freeways and their cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,37,right,3) -> at time T: [37+3T, 48+3T]\n  We are safe at time T on freeway 1 if 0 is not in [37+3T, 48+3T] -> i.e., if 0 < 37+3T or 0 > 48+3T -> always 37+3T>0 since T>=0? Actually, T=0: 37 to 48 -> 0 is not in [37,48] -> safe at T=0? But we are not on freeway1 at T=0.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> this seems odd: head=-48, tail=-59? Then the initial span for this right-moving car is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. At time T: [-59+6T, -48+6T]. \n  We need to avoid when 0 is in [-59+6T, -48+6T]. \n  Solve: -59+6T <= 0 <= -48+6T \n  => 6T >= 59? -> T>=ceil(59/6)=10 (since 6*9=54, 6*10=60 -> T=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not in it. Actually, at T=10: [1,12] -> 0 not in. \n  When is 0 in the interval?\n    -59+6T <= 0 => T <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> T<=9\n    and 0<= -48+6T => 48<=6T => T>=8.\n    So T from 8 to 9 (inclusive) are dangerous? \n    T=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ] -> includes 0? Yes, because 0 is between -11 and 0? \n        But note: the interval is [left_end, right_end] and if the car is right-moving, the left_end is the leftmost and right_end the rightmost? So 0 is in [-11,0] -> yes, 0 is the right_end? \n        The problem says: collision if 0 is in the span. So at T=8, the car covers [-11,0] -> so 0 is the right_end, which is included? Yes, so collision.\n\n    T=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> so also collision.\n\n    T=10: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\n    So freeway2 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2? (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as above: dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway2: dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway5: two cars:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> at T: [37+12T, 48+12T] -> always positive? so never covers 0? because 37+12T >=37>0 for T>=0.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> at T: [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [12T-11, 12T]\n      We need to avoid when 0 is in [12T-11, 12T]\n      Solve: 12T-11 <= 0 <= 12T \n        => 12T-11<=0 => T<=11/12 -> T=0: 12*0-11=-11, 0: so [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is from -11 to 0. So at T=0, it covers 0? \n        But T=0: [ -11, 0] -> yes, 0 is the right_end -> collision.\n        T=1: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n        T=2: [13,24] -> no.\n\n      So freeway5 is dangerous only at T=0? \n\nBut wait: we are going to be on freeway5 at a particular turn. We start at turn0 at y=0. We can only be on freeway5 at turn T if we move to it at turn T (so at turn T we are on freeway5). \n\nSo if we are at freeway5 at turn0, we would collide. But we start at y=0, so we are not on freeway5 at turn0.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) -> so dangerous at T=0 (for the second car) and then safe for T>=1? \n\nBut note: the first car is safe because it never covers 0. The second car: at T=0: covers [-11,0] -> dangerous at T=0. At T=1: [1,12] -> safe. At T=2: [13,24] -> safe, etc.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway5 and 6: dangerous only at T=0.\n\nFreeway8: \n  Car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at T: [-59+12T, -48+12T]\n      Dangerous when 0 in [-59+12T, -48+12T]:\n        -59+12T <= 0 <= -48+12T\n        => 12T <=59 -> T<=59/12≈4.916 -> T<=4\n        and 12T>=48 -> T>=4\n        So T=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 included -> dangerous.\n        T=5: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> same as above: dangerous at T=0: [ -11,0] -> dangerous at T=0, and safe for T>=1.\n\n  So freeway8 is dangerous at T=0 (because of car2) and at T=4 (because of car1).\n\nNow, we are at (0,0) at turn0. We can only move to y=1 at the next turn? \n\nWe have to plan a sequence of actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe must avoid:\n  For freeway1: never dangerous? because the car is always at [37+3T, 48+3T] which is always above 0? \n  Freeway2,3,4: dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n  Freeway5,6,7: dangerous at T=0 (so if we are on freeway5 at turn0 -> but we are not at turn0, but if we are at turn1? we are safe because at turn1, T=1 -> freeway5: the car that was dangerous at T=0 moves to [1,12] at T=1 -> safe. \n      However, note: if we are on freeway5 at turn T (for T>=1) then we are safe? because the dangerous car at T=0 is gone? \n      But what about other cars? freeway5 has two cars: the first car is safe for all T, the second car is safe for T>=1.\n\n  Similarly, freeway8: dangerous at T=0 and T=4.\n\nBut note: we are going to traverse freeways 1 to 8. We start at y0=0 at turn0.\n\nAt turn0: we are at y0=0. We can choose an action: U, D, or S. \n  If we choose U: then at turn1 we move to y1=1. \n  If we choose S: then we stay at y0=0 at turn1? No: at turn0 we are at (0,0). After taking an action at turn0, at the next state (turn1) we update: \n      y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nSo:\n  turn0: position (0,0) -> we take action a0.\n  turn1: position (0, y1) = (0, 0+Δy0) -> and so on.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway (y in [1,8]). \n\nAt turn0: we are at y0=0 -> no car -> safe.\n\nAt turn1: we are at y1 (which is either 0,1, or -1? but -1 is invalid -> so we cannot go down from 0). \n  So possible actions at turn0: \n    S: then y1=0 -> safe (not a freeway)\n    U: then y1=1 -> freeway1. Now we are at turn1 (T=1) on freeway1. Check freeway1 at T=1: \n        car: [37+3*1, 48+3*1] = [40,51] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\n    D: invalid? because y1 = 0-1 = -1 -> not allowed -> so we cannot do D at turn0.\n\nSo at turn0, we can do S or U.\n\nBut our goal is to go to y=9 as fast as possible. So we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the dangerous turns on the freeways.\n\nLet me summarize the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\ny=1: freeway1: never dangerous? because the car is always above 0? \n  At T=0: [37,48] -> safe.\n  T=1: [40,51] -> safe.\n  T=2: [43,54] -> safe.\n  ... always safe.\n\ny=2: freeway2: dangerous at T=8 and T=9? \n  T=8: [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n  T=9: [-5,6] -> dangerous.\n  T=10: [1,12] -> safe.\n\ny=3: same as y=2: dangerous at T=8,9.\n\ny=4: same: dangerous at T=8,9.\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=0? \n  But note: we can only be at freeway5 at a turn T>= the turn we first move to it. \n  At T=0: dangerous, but we cannot be at freeway5 at T=0 (unless we start there, but we start at y=0).\n  So if we are at freeway5 at any turn T>=1: \n      T=1: [12*1-11, 12*1] = [1,12] -> safe.\n      T>=1: safe.\n\ny=6: same as y=5: safe for T>=1.\n\ny=7: same as y=5: safe for T>=1.\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=0 and T=4? \n  T=0: dangerous (because of car2: [ -11,0] and car1: [-59, -48] -> but car2 covers 0 at T=0) -> dangerous at T=0.\n  T=1: \n      car1: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe (doesn't cover 0)\n      car2: [12*1-11, 12*1] = [1,12] -> safe.\n  T=2: car1: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe; car2: [13,24] -> safe.\n  T=3: car1: [-23,-12] -> safe; car2: [25,36] -> safe.\n  T=4: car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> dangerous (covers 0); car2: [48-11,48] = [37,48] -> safe? but 0 not in [37,48]. So only car1 is dangerous at T=4? \n        So overall: at T=4, freeway8 has a car covering 0 -> dangerous.\n  T=5: car1: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe; car2: [60-11,60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, freeway8 is dangerous at T=0 and T=4.\n\nSo the dangerous freeways and turns are:\n  y=2,3,4: dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n  y=8: dangerous at turn4.\n\nWe are starting at turn0 at y0=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns? At least 9 moves (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait sometimes.\n\nBut note: we can also move down to avoid a dangerous freeway? but that might cost more turns.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway2,3,4 at turns 8 or 9, and avoid being on freeway8 at turn4.\n\nWe can plan:\n\nOption 1: go straight up without stopping.\n\nTurn0: at y0=0 -> do U -> turn1: y1=1 (freeway1, safe at any turn? so safe at turn1: T=1 -> freeway1: safe)\nTurn1: at y1=1 -> do U -> turn2: y2=2 (freeway2). Now we are at freeway2 at turn2? T=2 -> check freeway2 at T=2: \n        [-59+6*2, -48+6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> safe.\n\nTurn2: do U -> turn3: y3=3 (freeway3) at turn3: \n        freeway3: same as freeway2 -> [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nTurn3: do U -> turn4: y4=4 (freeway4) at turn4: \n        freeway4: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nBut now we are going to freeway5 at turn5? \n  Turn4: at freeway4 -> do U -> turn5: y5=5 (freeway5) at turn5: T=5 -> freeway5: safe? because T=5>=1 -> safe.\n\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y6=6 (freeway6) at turn6: T=6 -> safe (since freeway6 safe for T>=1).\n\nTurn6: U -> turn7: y7=7 (freeway7) at turn7: safe.\n\nTurn7: U -> turn8: y8=8 (freeway8) at turn8: T=8 -> freeway8: \n        car1: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48] -> safe (0 not in [37,48])\n        car2: [12*8-11, 12*8] = [96-11,96] = [85,96] -> safe.\n        So safe? \n\nBut wait: we are at freeway8 at turn8, and T=8 is safe? because the dangerous time for freeway8 was T=4. \n\nThen turn8: U -> turn9: y9=9 -> goal.\n\nSo that would be 9 turns? \n\nBut wait: we started at turn0 and we took 9 actions? \n  Actions: from turn0 to turn8: 9 actions? and at turn9 we are at y9=9.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n  We start at turn0 (t1=0). We take actions at turn0, turn1, ... turn8 (9 actions) and then at turn9 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, and H is the minimal number of turns? \n\nSo H = 9? \n\nBut we must check if at any turn we are on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\nIn the above:\n\n  turn0: y=0 -> safe.\n  turn1: y=1 (freeway1) at T=1 -> safe.\n  turn2: y=2 (freeway2) at T=2 -> safe (because T=2 is not 8 or 9).\n  turn3: y=3 (freeway3) at T=3 -> safe.\n  turn4: y=4 (freeway4) at T=4 -> safe (T=4 not 8 or 9).\n  turn5: y=5 (freeway5) at T=5 -> safe (because T>=1).\n  turn6: y=6 (freeway6) at T=6 -> safe.\n  turn7: y=7 (freeway7) at T=7 -> safe.\n  turn8: y=8 (freeway8) at T=8 -> safe (because T=8 is not 4? and we checked above: at T=8 freeway8 is safe).\n\nThen turn9: we don't take an action? We are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut the problem says: we take actions from t=0 to H-1, and then at the state after the last action we are at (0,9). \n\nSo we need to be at (0,9) at turn H (which is after H actions). \n\nIn the above, after 9 actions (at turn0 to turn8) we end at turn9 at y=9 -> so H=9.\n\nBut wait: we must check freeway8 at turn8: \n  We are at freeway8 at turn8: T=8.\n  Freeway8 cars: \n    car1: at T=8: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [37,48] -> safe.\n    car2: [12*8-11, 12*8] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nHowever, we must check freeway2,3,4 at turns 8 and 9? \n  But in our path, we were at freeway2 at turn2 (T=2), freeway3 at turn3 (T=3), freeway4 at turn4 (T=4) -> none of these are T=8 or 9.\n\nBut what about if we had been at freeway2 at turn8? we were not.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  turn0: U\n  turn1: U\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: U\n  turn4: U\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n\nThen we end at turn9 at y=9.\n\nBut is that 9 actions? Yes.\n\nHowever, we must consider: is there a possibility that we can do it in fewer? \n  The minimal number of moves is 9 because we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9: 9 moves up.\n\nSo we cannot do it in fewer than 9.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up twice in a row? that's what we did.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the dangerous times. \n\nIn the above, we avoided the dangerous times for freeway2,3,4 (which are at T=8,9) by being at freeway2 at T=2, freeway3 at T=3, freeway4 at T=4, which are safe.\n\nAnd freeway8 at T=8 was safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? we are going as fast as possible: 1 per turn.\n\nAlternatively, what if we wait at some freeway? that would take more turns.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at turn4: we were not there at turn4? we were at freeway4 at turn4.\n\nNow, is there any danger if we go straight up? \n\nOne more: freeway5,6,7: we passed at T=5,6,7 -> all safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway8 at turn4? we were not there.\n\nSo the above sequence seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway8 at turn8: \n  car1: [ -59 + 12*8 = -59+96 = 37, -48+96=48 ] -> [37,48] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n  car2: [12*8-11, 12*8] = [96-11,96] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: the car2 at freeway8 was given as (0,-11,right,12) -> so at T=8: \n  left_end = -11 + 12*8 = -11+96 = 85? \n  right_end = 0 + 12*8 = 96 -> so [85,96] -> yes.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do it in 9 moves.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=9.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 8? \n  To get from y0=0 to y8=9, we need 9 moves? because each U moves by 1. \n  So 8 moves would get us to y8=8, not 9. \n\nTherefore, 9 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut wait: the answer format is for turn t1 (which is 0) and then t1+1, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn8, and then we are at turn9 at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to t=H-1. Here H=9, so t from 0 to 8.\n\nBut we must write the actions for turn0, turn1, ... turn8.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nBut wait: I just noticed that freeway8 at turn4 is dangerous, but we were not there. However, what if we had been at freeway8 at turn4? we were at freeway4 at turn4, so no.\n\nBut let me check if we are safe at freeway1 at turn1: \n  freeway1: [37+3*1, 48+3*1] = [40,51] -> safe.\n\nfreeway2 at turn2: [-59+6*2, -48+6*2] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nfreeway3 at turn3: same as freeway2 at turn3: [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nfreeway4 at turn4: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nfreeway5 at turn5: \n  car1: [37+12*5,48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe (0 not in)\n  car2: [12*5-11, 12*5] = [60-11,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nfreeway6 at turn6: same as freeway5: \n  car1: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe\n  car2: [72-11,72]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nfreeway7 at turn7: \n  car1: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] -> safe\n  car2: [84-11,84]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nfreeway8 at turn8: as above: safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut note: we must also consider if we can go down? but we are going up and it works.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 and the sequence is 9 consecutive U's.\n\nBut wait: what about the freeway5,6,7 at turn0? we are not there at turn0. And we are there at turns 5,6,7 which are safe.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". We found H=9 and the sequence.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but in the context, H is the number of actions? and then we end at turn H (if we start at turn0). \n\nYes.\n\nSo we write the boxed answer.\n\nBut the current turn is t1=0, so we write:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\n...\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut note: the turn indices: \n  The sequence is for t = t1 (which is 0) to t1+H-1 (which is 0+9-1=8).\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\", etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut note: we have 9 lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 0+1: U\n...\nTurn 0+8: U\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: ...\", \"Turn t_1+1: ...\", so we write:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait: is there a possibility that we get stuck? For example, if we had to avoid freeway8 at turn4, we might have to wait? but we didn't go there at turn4.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 9 U's.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The player starts at (0, 0) at turn 0. The minimal number of turns required is 9, as the player must move up 9 times to go from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined by moving up (U) at every turn, ensuring no collisions occur:\n- At turn 0, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars).\n- At turn 1, after moving up, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1). The car on freeway 1 at turn 1 has span \\([40, 51]\\) (calculated as \\([37 + 3 \\times 1, 48 + 3 \\times 1]\\)), which does not contain 0, so safe.\n- At turn 2, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). The car on freeway 2 at turn 2 has span \\([-47, -36]\\) (from \\([-59 + 6 \\times 2, -48 + 6 \\times 2]\\)), no 0, safe.\n- At turn 3, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). The car on freeway 3 at turn 3 has span \\([-41, -30]\\) (similar calculation), no 0, safe.\n- At turn 4, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). The car on freeway 4 at turn 4 has span \\([-35, -24]\\), no 0, safe.\n- At turn 5, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). The cars on freeway 5 at turn 5 are safe: first car \\([97, 108]\\), second car \\([49, 60]\\), neither contains 0.\n- At turn 6, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Cars are safe: first car \\([109, 120]\\), second car \\([61, 72]\\), no 0.\n- At turn 7, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Cars are safe: first car \\([121, 132]\\), second car \\([73, 84]\\), no 0.\n- At turn 8, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 8 are safe: first car \\([37, 48]\\) (from \\([-59 + 12 \\times 8, -48 + 12 \\times 8]\\)), second car \\([85, 96]\\) (from \\([-11 + 12 \\times 8, 0 + 12 \\times 8]\\)), neither contains 0.\n- After the 9th action (at turn 8), the player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 9, reaching the goal.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is 9 consecutive \"U\" actions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically, and the cars move horizontally on their respective freeways. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and the x=0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at turn T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], since they start from [τ, h] at t_1.\n\nt_1 is given as the current turn, which is 1. So for any future turn T, the time elapsed is T - 1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1 = T - 1.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ at t_1, at turn T, head position is h + s(Δt), tail position is τ + s(Δt), so the span is [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)].\n\nCollision occurs if the player is on freeway k at turn T and 0 is between τ + s(Δt) and h + s(Δt) inclusive for some car on freeway k.\n\nThe player position changes based on actions: U for up, D for down, S for stay. y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t as defined.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 from y=1, so I need to move up 8 units. Since I can only move one step at a time or stay, the minimum number of turns without any obstacles would be 8, all U actions. But with cars, I might need to wait or detour.\n\ny starts at 1, and I need to get to 9, so I need to increase y by 8. Each U increases by 1, so minimum H=8 if I can go straight up without colliding.\n\nBut I have to check for each freeway y=1 to y=8 whether at the time I'm on that row, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to consider when I arrive at each y.\n\nThe player moves at each turn, so at turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and after action, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of each turn, I think? Let me read.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, if I am on freeway k (y_T = k), and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I am not on the new freeway until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T, and collision is checked based on cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf I move vertically at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and only move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, for each turn that I am on a freeway between 1 and 8, 0 must not be in any car's span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, since I start at y=1 at turn t_1=1.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (51, 40, right, 3)  head=51, tail=40? But for right-moving, it says head h, tail τ, and since it's moving right, h should be greater than τ, I assume.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)]\n\nWith τ and h, but in the table, for freeway 1: (51,40,right,3), so head=51, tail=40, but 51>40, so tail=40, head=51, so [40,51] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut for freeway 2,3,4: (-42,-53,right,6) head=-42, tail=-53? -42 > -53, so tail=-53, head=-42, so span at t_1 is [-53,-42].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7: two cars each: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFor (60,49,right,12): head=60, tail=49, 60>49, so [49,60]\n\nAnd (12,1,right,12): head=12, tail=1, so [1,12]\n\nFreeway 8: (-36,-47,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, so [-47,-36]\n\nSecond car: [1,12]\n\nNow, t_1=1, so for any future turn T, Δt = T - 1\n\nI need to find when 0 is covered on each freeway.\n\nFor collision on freeway k at turn T, 0 must be in the span of some car on k at T.\n\nSince cars move, the span changes over time.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, I need to check if any car covers 0 at time T.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered, i.e., when there is a car such that τ + s(Δt) <= 0 <= h + s(Δt) for some car.\n\nSince the cars are moving right, the span is shifting right over time.\n\nFor a given car, the time when it covers 0 can be found by solving τ + s(Δt) <= 0 <= h + s(Δt)\n\nLet me define for each car the interval of Δt when 0 is covered.\n\nFor a car, min_x = τ + s(Δt), max_x = h + s(Δt)\n\n0 is covered if min_x <= 0 <= max_x, so τ + s(Δt) <= 0 <= h + s(Δt)\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for Δt.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s(Δt) <= 0 => s(Δt) <= -τ => Δt <= -τ / s  (if s>0)\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= h + s(Δt) => s(Δt) >= -h => Δt >= -h / s\n\nSo Δt must satisfy -h/s <= Δt <= -τ/s\n\nSince τ < h, -τ/s > -h/s, so the interval is [ -h/s, -τ/s ]\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) and Δt <= floor( -τ/s )? But since time is integer, we need to find integer Δt where this holds.\n\nΔt is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nSo for a car, 0 is covered at Δt if max( ceil(-h/s), something) but let's compute the range.\n\nThe condition is:\n\n-h/s <= Δt <= -τ/s\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s), but need to check the inequalities.\n\nSince τ + s(Δt) <= 0 <= h + s(Δt)\n\nFor example, τ + s(Δt) <= 0 <= h + s(Δt)\n\nSo 0 <= h + s(Δt) implies Δt >= ceil( -h/s )? Let's think carefully.\n\ns(Δt) >= -h, so Δt >= ceil( -h/s )\n\nSimilarly, τ + s(Δt) <= 0, s(Δt) <= -τ, so Δt <= floor( -τ/s )\n\nAnd since τ < h, floor(-τ/s) >= ceil(-h/s), so the interval is from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) inclusive.\n\nBut ceil and floor depend on the values.\n\nSince s(Δt) >= -h, and s(Δt) <= -τ, so Δt >= ceil( -h/s ) and Δt <= floor( -τ/s )\n\nThen the values of Δt where both are satisfied.\n\nNow, let's compute for each car on each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, h=51, τ=40, s=3\n\nSo -h/s = -51/3 = -17\n\n-τ/s = -40/3 ≈ -13.333\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(-17) = ceil(-17) = -17? ceil is for real numbers, but -17 is integer, so ceil(-17) = -17\n\nΔt <= floor(-13.333) = -14? floor(-13.333) = -14 because floor is the greatest integer less than or equal, so -14 <= -13.333 < -13, so floor(-13.333) = -14\n\nThen Δt >= ceil(-17) = -17\n\nΔt <= floor(-13.333) = -14\n\nBut Δt = T - 1, and T >=1, so Δt >=0. But here Δt from -17 to -14, which is negative, so for Δt >=0, no coverage, since the car is moving right and at Δt=0, τ + s(0) =40, h+s(0)=51, both positive, so 0 is not covered, and as Δt increases, min_x and max_x increase, so 0 is never covered for Δt >=0. Since min_x at Δt=0 is 40>0, and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: car (-42,-53,right,6) so h=-42, τ=-53, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-42)/6 = 42/6 = 7\n\n- τ/s = -(-53)/6 = 53/6 ≈ 8.833\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(7) =7\n\nΔt <= floor(8.833) =8\n\nSo at Δt=7 and Δt=8\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car description: (-42,-53,right,6), so same, Δt=7,8\n\nFreeway 4: same, Δt=7,8\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) h=60, τ=49, s=12\n\n- h/s = -60/12 = -5\n\n- τ/s = -49/12 ≈ -4.083\n\nΔt >= ceil(-5) = -5\n\nΔt <= floor(-4.083) = -5? floor(-4.083) = -5 since -5 < -4.083 < -4, so floor is -5\n\nThen Δt >= -5 and Δt <= -5, so only Δt= -5\n\nBut Δt >=0, so no coverage.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) h=12, τ=1, s=12\n\n- h/s = -12/12 = -1\n\n- τ/s = -1/12 ≈ -0.083\n\nΔt >= ceil(-1) = -1\n\nΔt <= floor(-0.083) = -1\n\nSo only Δt= -1, not in range.\n\nSo for freeway 5, no car covers 0 at any Δt >=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars as 5, so no coverage.\n\nFreeway 7: same, no coverage.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) h=-36, τ=-47, s=12\n\n- h/s = -(-36)/12 = 36/12 =3\n\n- τ/s = -(-47)/12 = 47/12 ≈ 3.9167\n\nΔt >= ceil(3) =3\n\nΔt <= floor(3.9167) =3\n\nSo only Δt=3\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) same as before, no coverage.\n\nSo for freeway 8, car 1 covers 0 at Δt=3.\n\nΔt=3 means T -1 =3, so T=4.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when 0 is covered:\n\nFreeway 1: never\n\nFreeway 2: at Δt=7 and 8, so T=8 and 9\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: never\n\nFreeway 6: never\n\nFreeway 7: never\n\nFreeway 8: at Δt=3, T=4\n\nT is the turn number.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=1 at y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1, but y must stay in [0,9].\n\nSince I need to increase y, and 0 is covered only on certain freeways at certain times, I can plan the path to avoid being on those freeways at those times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Freeway 2,3,4 have collision at T=8 and T=9\n\n- Freeway 8 has collision at T=4\n\n- Others are safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 1,5,6,7 are always safe.\n\nI start at y=1 at turn 1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe, so no problem at turn 1.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path might be to go up directly, but I have to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or 9, and not on y=8 at T=4.\n\ny=8 at T=4 is dangerous.\n\nAlso, y=2,3,4 at T=8 or 9 dangerous.\n\nSince I start at turn 1, y=1.\n\nIf I go up every turn, at turn t, y_t = 1 + (t-1) for t from 1 to ? Let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn 1: y=1\n\nAfter action, if I do U, at turn 2, y=2\n\nSimilarly, if always U:\n\nTurn 1: y=1\n\nTurn 2: y=2\n\nTurn 3: y=3\n\nTurn 4: y=4\n\nTurn 5: y=5\n\nTurn 6: y=6\n\nTurn 7: y=7\n\nTurn 8: y=8\n\nTurn 9: y=9\n\nAt turn 9, y=9, which is the goal, and since y=9, no freeway, no car, so safe. The freeways are from y=1 to 8, y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nBut during the path, I need to check for each turn when I am on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 1: y=1, freeway 1, always safe, ok.\n\nTurn 2: y=2, freeway 2. When is it dangerous? At T=8 and T=9. Turn 2 is early, not 8 or 9, so safe? Freeway 2 is dangerous only at T=8 and T=9, so at turn 2, which is T=2, not 8 or 9, so no collision, since car not covering 0 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, turn 3: y=3, freeway 3, dangerous at T=8,9, not turn 3, safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=4, freeway 4, dangerous at T=8,9, not turn 4, safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=5, freeway 5, always safe, ok.\n\nTurn 6: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=8, freeway 8. Freeway 8 is dangerous at T=4.\n\nTurn 8 is T=8, not T=4, so should be safe? At T=4, it is dangerous, but at other times, not necessarily.\n\nFreeway 8 has a car that covers 0 only at T=4, as we computed.\n\nAt other times, no coverage, so safe.\n\nAt turn 8, T=8, not 4, so safe.\n\nThen turn 9: y=9, goal, safe.\n\nBut what about turn 4? In this sequence, at turn 4, y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 is dangerous only at T=8 and T=9, not at T=4, so safe.\n\nIn this direct path, all seems safe except we need to confirm.\n\nTurn 8: y=8, T=8, freeway 8. Danger at T=4, not T=8, so ok.\n\nBut freeway 8 has collision only at T=4, so at T=8, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2,3,4 at T=8 and T=9, but in this path, at T=8, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, not freeway 2,3,4. Freeway 2,3,4 are y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=8, if I am on y=8, not on y=2,3,4, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, if I am on y=9, not on any freeway, safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 9, y=9, reached.\n\nBut turn 9 is T=9, and at T=9, freeway 2,3,4 are dangerous, but since I am not on them, no issue.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nTurn 1: y=1, safe\n\nTurn 2: y=2, freeway 2, but dangerous only at T=8,9. T=2 ≠8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 3: y=3, T=3, not 8,9, safe\n\nTurn 4: y=4, T=4, not 8,9, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 6: y=6, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=7, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=8, T=8, freeway 8, danger only at T=4, not T=8, so safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=9, goal.\n\nSo with 8 actions from turn 1 to turn 8? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 1, I am at y=1, I perform action for the next turn.\n\nI need to specify actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nt_1=1, I start at (0,1), which is at turn 1.\n\nI perform action a_{t_1} = a_1, then at turn 2, I am at y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, since I start at y=1, I need to increase by 8, so minimum 8 moves up.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, I move to turn t+1.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T=1, y_1=1\n\nAfter action a_1, at turn T=2, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\nAt turn T, y_T\n\nI reach y=9 when y_T=9 for some T.\n\nThe turn when I first reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, if I do U every turn from turn 1 to turn 8? Actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at position.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nI perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and 0 covered.\n\nI start at turn 1, y_1=1.\n\nI perform actions a_1, a_2, ..., up to some a_K, so that at turn K+1, y_{K+1} =9.\n\nThe number of actions H, and at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nt_1=1, so after H actions, at turn 1+H, y_{1+H} =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that I can have y_{1+H} =9.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\na_1 = U, then at turn 2, y_2 =1 +1=2\n\na_2 = U, turn 3, y_3=3\n\na_3 = U, turn 4, y_4=4\n\na_4 = U, turn 5, y_5=5\n\na_5 = U, turn 6, y_6=6\n\na_6 = U, turn 7, y_7=7\n\na_7 = U, turn 8, y_8=8\n\na_8 = U, turn 9, y_9=9\n\nNow, check collision at each turn:\n\nTurn 1: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nTurn 2: y=2, freeway 2, T=2, not 8 or 9, safe\n\nTurn 3: y=3, freeway 3, T=3, not 8 or 9, safe\n\nTurn 4: y=4, freeway 4, T=4, not 8 or 9, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=5, freeway 5, always safe\n\nTurn 6: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=8, freeway 8, T=8, danger at T=4 only, not T=8, so safe\n\nTurn 9: y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nSo all good, and I reach at turn 9 with 8 actions.\n\nBut is there a problem at turn 4? Freeway 8 has danger at T=4, but at turn 4, I am on y=4, not y=8, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, freeway 8 is dangerous, but if I am not on it, fine.\n\nIn this case, no collision, and H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 8 at T=4.\n\nT=4, Δt = T-1 =3, as we had Δt=3 for freeway 8.\n\nAt Δt=3, T=4, freeway 8 car covers 0.\n\nBut in the path, at turn 4, I am on y=4, not y=8, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, freeway 2,3,4 dangerous, but at turn 8, I am on y=8, not y=2,3,4, so safe.\n\nSo direct up with 8 actions seems possible.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so at y=9, no collision.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions from turn t_1.\n\nt_1=1, so actions a_1 to a_8, all U.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, which is the number of actions, I think.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nIn this case, t_1=1, actions from a_1 to a_{1+H-1} = a_H\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9)\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is reached.\n\nIn the sequence above, after 8 actions, at turn 1+8=9, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1 = 1 + 8 -1 =8, position is? Turn 8, y=8, not 9.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, I move to y_{T+1}.\n\nTo have y_T =9 at some T.\n\nIn the action sequence, when I perform the last action.\n\nSuppose I start at turn 1, y_1=1.\n\nI perform a_1, then at turn 2, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\nAfter performing a_{K}, at turn K+1, y_{K+1} = y_K + Δy_K\n\nI want y_{K+1} =9.\n\nThe turn when I am at (0,9) is turn K+1.\n\nIn the sequence, with K=8 actions: a_1 to a_8, all U.\n\nThen y_2=2, y_3=3, ..., y_9=9.\n\nSo at turn 9, I am at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is a_1 to a_{1+H-1} = a_H\n\nHere H=8, actions a_1 to a_8.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1 +1 = t_1 + H, position is reached.\n\nt_1 + H =1+8=9.\n\nNow, the turn when collision is checked is during the path, from turn 1 to 8, since at turn 9, no freeway.\n\nIn turn 1 to 8, we are on freeways 1 to 8 respectively, and as above, no collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought about T=4 for freeway 8, but at turn 4, I am on y=4.\n\nIs there any issue with freeway 8 at other times?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: at t_1=1, cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=12\n\nAt Δt, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 covered when -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 12 Δt\n\nSo -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt <= 3 since integer? 12 Δt <=47, Δt <= floor(47/12)= floor(3.916)=3\n\n12*3=36 <=47, 12*4=48>47, so Δt <=3? But inequality: -47 +12 Δt <=0\n\n-47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11 <=0, true\n\n-47+12*4= -47+48=1>0? 1>0, so -47+12*4=1 >0, not <=0.\n\nThe inequality is min_x <=0, min_x = τ + s Δt = -47 +12 Δt\n\nSet <=0: -47 +12 Δt <=0 => 12 Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈3.916, so for Δt <=3, since Δt=3: -47+36=-11<=0, Δt=4: -47+48=1>0, not <=0.\n\nNow max_x = h + s Δt = -36 +12 Δt\n\n0 <= max_x: 0 <= -36 +12 Δt => 12 Δt >=36 => Δt >=3\n\nSo 0 <= max_x when Δt >=3\n\n0 covered when min_x <=0 and 0<= max_x, so -47+12 Δt <=0 and 0 <= -36 +12 Δt\n\nWhich is Δt <=3 and Δt >=3, so only Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, min_x = -47+36= -11 <=0, max_x= -36+36=0, so 0<=0, covered.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), min_x=1+12 Δt, at Δt=0, min_x=1>0, so never <=0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at Δt=3, T=4, freeway 8 has collision if player is there.\n\nIn our path, at T=4, we are on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2,3,4 at T=8 and 9.\n\nFreeway 2: car (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nh=-42, τ=-53, s=6\n\nmin_x = τ + s Δt = -53 +6 Δt\n\nmax_x = h + s Δt = -42 +6 Δt\n\n0 covered when -53+6 Δt <=0 <= -42 +6 Δt\n\nFirst: -53+6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=53 => Δt <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so Δt <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 +6 Δt => 6 Δt >=42 => Δt >=7\n\nSo Δt from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nAt Δt=7: min_x=-53+42= -11<=0, max_x=-42+42=0, covered\n\nΔt=8: min_x=-53+48= -5<=0, max_x=-42+48=6>0, covered\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9 (since Δt=7, T=8; Δt=8, T=9)\n\nIn our path, at T=8, we are on y=8, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=9, we are on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, with 8 actions all U, we can reach.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,1) at turn 1, and we reach (0,9) at turn 9.\n\nPerhaps I can do it faster? But to go from y=1 to y=9, I need at least 8 up moves, since each move changes y by at most 1, so minimum 8 actions, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nUnless I can stay or something, but staying doesn't help to reach faster, since I need to increase y.\n\nSo H=8 should be achievable and minimal.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, I said no coverage, but let me confirm freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: min_x=49+12 Δt, at Δt=0, 49>0, increasing, so min_x >0 always, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: min_x=1+12 Δt >0 always, so no.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 same.\n\nFreeway 1: min_x=40+3 Δt >0, no coverage.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nActions from turn t_1=1 to t_1 + H -1 =1+8-1=8, so a_1 to a_8.\n\nEach action U.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\n\nTurn 2: a_{2} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1 for the index, but actions labeled by turn.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=1:\n\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\n\nTurn 2: a_{2} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? For example, if I stayed at some point, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nOr if I went down, but y=0, but I need to go to 9, so down is counterproductive.\n\nSo all U should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, if I were on y=8, I would collide, but in this path I am not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, if I were on y=2,3, or 4, I would collide, but I am on y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=8 is safe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, but in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some turn, moving might avoid, but here no need.\n\nSo I think H=8 with all U is correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case 8.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,1) at turn 1.\n\nAnd cars as given.\n\nPerhaps I misread the freeway indices.\n\nFreeway k for y=k, I assume.\n\ny=1 to 8 are freeways.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the player position, y=0 and y=9 are allowed, but no cars, so safe.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5,6,7, there are two cars, but we saw no coverage.\n\nIn freeway 5, cars (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), both spans are positive and increasing, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with actions all U.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\nTurn 2: a_{2} = U\nTurn 3: a_{3} = U\nTurn 4: a_{4} = U\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n}\n\nIn the format, it should be like \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" with the action.\n\nAnd since t_1=1, and H=8.\n\nPerhaps write it clearly.\n\nSince it says \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so for t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_1\n\nt=1, a_2, ..., t=7, a_8 for H=8.\n\nBut in output, it's per turn.\n\nI think the way I have is fine.\n\nSo the sequence is 8 turns of U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 4, anything.\n\nTurn 4, y=4, freeway 4, which has cars, but at T=4, not dangerous, since dangerous only at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the collision times again.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4: collision at T=8 and T=9\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=4\n\nIn the path: at T=4, y=4, which is freeway 4, but freeway 4 collision only at T=8,9, not T=4, so safe.\n\nAt T=8, y=8, freeway 8, collision only at T=4, not T=8, safe.\n\nAt T=9, y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the answer should be all U for 8 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and in this case no collision.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 8, with all actions being \"U\" (up).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 2. I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're going from y=2 to y=9, we probably want to go up most of the time, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision happens only if at the turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T you are still on y_T, and you only check for collision on y_T at that turn. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nFirst, the current turn is t_1 = 2. So at turn 2, we have the car states.\n\nFor each freeway, there might be multiple cars, but from the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head 54, tail 43, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span at t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] with t_1=2.\n\nLet me define the span relative to turn t.\n\nAt turn T, for a car given at t_1 with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nIf right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], so at time T, it should be [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, I think. Direction is given as \"right\" for all.\n\nFreeway 1: d=right, so span at T: [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] with τ=43, h=54, s=3? Head and tail: it says (54,43,right,3). Typically head is the front, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span should be from τ to h, increasing.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere all are right-moving except... let's check the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (54,43,right,3) — so head=54, tail=43? But if right-moving, tail should be smaller than head? 43 to 54, yes, tail=43, head=54.\n\nBut in the span, it should be from min to max, so [43,54] at t_1=2.\n\nThen at T, [43 + 3(T-2), 54 + 3(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-36,-47,right,6) — tail=-47, head=-36? -47 to -36, which is increasing, so tail=-47, head=-36.\n\nAt t_1=2, span [ -47, -36 ]\n\nAt T, [ -47 + 6(T-2), -36 + 6(T-2) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-36,-47,right,6) — it says (-36,-47), but that would be head=-36, tail=-47, but -36 > -47, so if right-moving, it should be from left to right, so tail is left, head is right. So tail=-47, head=-36, span [-47,-36] at t=2.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4: same.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: tail=-59, head=-48? -59 to -48, so tail=-59, head=-48, span [-59,-48] at t=2.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) — head=24, tail=13? 13 to 24, so tail=13, head=24, span [13,24] at t=2.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 and 7, same as 5? Freeway 6: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12) same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,-35,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: tail=-35, head=-24? -35 to -24, span [-35,-24] at t=2.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) tail=13, head=24, span [13,24] at t=2.\n\nNow, the player is at y=2 at turn t=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so no cars to worry about. But to reach (0,9), we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and y changes by -1,0,+1, the minimum H to go from 2 to 9 is 7 turns if we go up every time, but we might have to wait or detour due to cars.\n\nBut y can only change by 1 per turn, so minimum steps is 7, but we need to check if it's possible without collision.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need that for the freeway k=y_T, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, but for collision, if 0 is in any car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, since the cars are moving, we need to find when 0 is covered for each freeway at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at what times T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nDefine T relative to t_1=2, so let t = T - 2, so at time offset t=0, it's turn 2.\n\nThen for each freeway, find for which t (>=0) , 0 is in the span for that row.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCar: at t=0, span [43,54] for the car? No, at T, which is turn number.\n\nAt turn T, span = [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] with τ=43, h=54, s=3.\n\nSo span at T: [43 + 3(T-2), 54 + 3(T-2)]\n\nSet min = 43 + 3(T-2), max = 54 + 3(T-2)\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo 43 + 3(T-2) <= 0 <= 54 + 3(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: 43 + 3(T-2) <= 0\n\n43 + 3T - 6 <= 0\n\n37 + 3T <= 0\n\n3T <= -37\n\nT <= -37/3 ≈ -12.333\n\nSince T >=2, this is never true. 37 + 3T <=0? T >=2, 37+6=43>0, so always positive, min is increasing.\n\nmin at T=2: 43 + 0 =43 >0, and increasing, so min >0 for all T>=2, so 0 is never in the span for freeway 1. So y=1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nmin = 43 + 3(T-2) >= 43 >0, so 0 < min <= max, so 0 not in [min,max], yes. So on freeway 1, no car covers 0 at any time T>=2. So y=1 is safe to be on at any turn.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): car (-36,-47,right,6), so tail=-47, head=-36.\n\nAt T, span: [ -47 + 6(T-2), -36 + 6(T-2) ]\n\nmin = -47 + 6(T-2), max = -36 + 6(T-2)\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -47 + 6(T-2) <= 0 <= -36 + 6(T-2)\n\nFirst part: -47 + 6(T-2) <= 0\n\n6(T-2) <= 47\n\nT-2 <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833\n\nT <= 9.833\n\nSince T integer, T <=9\n\nSecond part: 0 <= -36 + 6(T-2)\n\n36 <= 6(T-2)\n\n6 <= T-2\n\nT >= 8\n\nSo 0 in span for T from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nT>=8 and T<=9, so at turns 8 and 9, 0 is covered on freeway 2.\n\nT is turn number, t_1=2, so at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut we start at T=2, so for T=8 and 9, if player is on y=2, collision.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Freeway 3 has (-36,-47,right,6), same as y=2.\n\nIn the table, freeway 2 and 3 both have the same car? No, freeway 2 has one car, freeway 3 has one car, both identical: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSo for y=3, same as y=2: at T, span [ -47 + 6(T-2), -36 + 6(T-2) ]\n\nSo min and max same, so 0 in span when T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: also (-36,-47,right,6), same, so y=4 also has collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5): two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), tail=-59, head=-48\n\nAt T, span [ -59 + 12(T-2), -48 + 12(T-2) ]\n\nmin1 = -59 + 12(T-2), max1 = -48 + 12(T-2)\n\n0 in [min1,max1] if min1 <=0 <= max1\n\n-59 +12(T-2) <=0 <= -48 +12(T-2)\n\nFirst: -59 +12(T-2) <=0 => 12(T-2) <=59 => T-2 <=59/12≈4.916 => T<=6.916, so T<=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12(T-2) => 48 <=12(T-2) => 4 <= T-2 => T>=6\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span only when T=6? T>=6 and T<=6, so T=6.\n\nT=6: min1 = -59 +12(4) = -59+48= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, max1= -48+48=0, so 0 <=0 true, so yes at T=6.\n\nSecond car on y=5: (24,13,right,12), tail=13, head=24\n\nAt T, span [13 + 12(T-2), 24 + 12(T-2)]\n\nmin2 =13 +12(T-2), max2=24+12(T-2)\n\nmin2 at T=2: 13>0, so always min2 >0, so 0 never in span for second car.\n\nSo on freeway 5, collision only from first car at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6): same as y=5, cars (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nSo similarly, first car covers 0 at T=6, second car never, so collision at T=6 only.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): same, collision at T=6 only.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): cars (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12), tail=-35, head=-24? Span at T: [ -35 +12(T-2), -24 +12(T-2) ]\n\nmin1 = -35 +12(T-2), max1 = -24 +12(T-2)\n\n0 in span if min1 <=0 <= max1\n\n-35 +12(T-2) <=0 <= -24 +12(T-2)\n\nFirst: -35 +12(T-2) <=0 => 12(T-2) <=35 => T-2 <=35/12≈2.916 => T<=4.916, so T<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12(T-2) => 24 <=12(T-2) => 2 <= T-2 => T>=4\n\nSo T=4 only? T>=4 and T<=4, so T=4.\n\nAt T=4: min1= -35 +12(2)= -35+24= -11 <=0, max1= -24+24=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), same as before, min=13+12(T-2) >0 always, so no cover.\n\nSo on y=8, collision only at T=4.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision happens (0 covered):\n\n- y=1: never\n\n- y=2: at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=3: at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=4: at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=5: at T=6\n\n- y=6: at T=6\n\n- y=7: at T=6\n\n- y=8: at T=4\n\nPlayer starts at T=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_final.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, no issue.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when 0 is covered at that turn.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9, collision.\n\n- If on y=5,6,7 at T=6, collision.\n\n- If on y=8 at T=4, collision.\n\n- Other times and other freeways are safe.\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\nNow, player can move up, down, or stay.\n\nStart at T=2, y=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=2, is it safe? For y=2, collision at T=8 and 9, not at T=2. At T=2, for y=2: min = -47 +6(0) = -47 <=0? At T=2, span min=-47, max=-36, -47<=0<=-36? 0 <= -36 is false, 0 > max since max=-36<0, so 0 not in span, safe. Similarly, other freeways at T=2 are safe except possibly, but y=5,6,7 at T=6 only, etc. So at T=2, all are safe, I think.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid bad times.\n\nBut since y=1 is always safe, we could go down to y=1 if needed, but that might cost extra moves.\n\nThe shortest path might be possible by timing.\n\nList the dangerous times:\n\n- For y=5,6,7: dangerous only at T=6\n\n- For y=8: dangerous at T=4\n\n- For y=2,3,4: dangerous at T=8,9\n\nSince we start at T=2, y=2, and want to go up.\n\nOne idea: go up as fast as possible, but check if we can avoid the collisions.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn starting from T=2.\n\nAt T=2: y=2, safe.\n\nAction U: at T=3, y=3 (since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn T, action a_T determines Δy_T for y_{T+1})\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position (0, y_T)\n\nWe choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and we check collision for that position at turn T+1.\n\nIn terms of collision: at turn T, after action, we are still at y_T for collision check? No.\n\nFrom the note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked based on y_T and Span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen you choose action a_T, which moves you to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check collision at T+1.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nStart at turn T=2, y=2.\n\nCheck collision at T=2: on y=2, as above, not dangerous, safe.\n\nChoose action a_2, which affects y_3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=3, we have y_3, check collision at T=3, and so on.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn from T=2 to T=8.\n\nT=2: y=2, safe. Action U, so y_3 = 3\n\nT=3: y=3, safe? At T=3, y=3, freeway 3. Collision only at T=8,9, so at T=3, safe. Action U, y_4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, freeway 4. Collision at T=8,9, not T=4, so safe. But action: if we go up, y_5=5\n\nBut at T=5: y=5, freeway 5. Collision at T=6, not T=5, so safe at T=5. Action U, y_6=6\n\nNow T=6: y=6, freeway 6. Collision at T=6! Yes, for y=6, at T=6, 0 is covered, so collision if we are on y=6 at T=6.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we go straight up, at T=6, we are on y=6, which has collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=8 at T=4, collision.\n\nIn this path, at T=6, y=6, collision.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Delay reaching y=6 so that we are not there at T=6.\n\n2. Be on a different row at T=6.\n\n3. Go down to avoid.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we could go down to y=1 at some point to wait.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nWe start at T=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous time for the middle rows is T=6.\n\nFor y=5,6,7, dangerous only at T=6, so if we are not on these rows at T=6, we are fine.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, dangerous at T=4, but T=4 is earlier.\n\nNow, T=4 is turn 4.\n\nAt T=4, if we are on y=8, collision, but we start at y=2 at T=2, it would take at least 6 up moves to reach y=8, from T=2 to T=8: at T=2 y=2, T=3 y=3, T=4 y=4, so at T=4, we can be at y=4 max if we go up each time. To be at y=8 at T=4, we need to go up 6 steps in 2 turns? Impossible, since each turn we can only move one step. From T=2 to T=4, we can be at y=4 at most (if U,U), so y=8 at T=4 is impossible. Similarly, y=5 at T=4 might be possible? y=2 to y=5 in 2 turns: need 3 up, but only 2 actions: from T=2 to T=3: one action to y_3, T=3 to T=4: second action to y_4. So y_4 can be from y_2 + Δy_2 + Δy_3, each ±1 or 0, so y_4 between 0 and 4, since y_2=2. So at T=4, y<=4, so y=8 not possible, so no issue with y=8 at T=4, since we can't be there.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7 at T=6: we can be there, as in the direct path.\n\nNow, back to T=6.\n\nWe need to not be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we could be on y=1 at T=6, or on y=8 or y=9, but y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\ny=8 at T=6: is it dangerous? For y=8, dangerous only at T=4, which is past, so at T=6, y=8 should be safe? Let's confirm.\n\nFor y=8, collision only at T=4, as per above.\n\nAt T=6, for freeway 8, cars: first car span at T=6: [ -35 +12(6-2), -24 +12(4) ] T-2=4? T=6, t_offset=4.\n\nmin1 = -35 +12(4) = -35+48=13, max1= -24+48=24\n\nSecond car min=13+12(4)=13+48=61, max=24+48=72, both >0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 no freeway.\n\ny=0 is bottom, but y=0 might be safe or not, but we don't need to go there.\n\ny=0: if y=0, is it a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=6, safe to be on y=0,1,8,9.\n\nNot on y=2,3,4,5,6,7? y=2,3,4 are dangerous only at T=8,9, not at T=6, so at T=6, y=2,3,4 are safe.\n\ny=5,6,7 dangerous at T=6.\n\nSo specifically, at T=6, we must not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nWe can be on y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9 at T=6.\n\nNow, from start, we are at T=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up when possible, but avoid being on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nT=6 is critical.\n\nNow, let's list the turns from T=2 to T=6.\n\nT=2: y=2, safe. We choose a_2, which sets y_3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need y_6 not in {5,6,7}.\n\ny_6 is the position at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: we are at y_6, and check collision at that turn.\n\nNow, from T=2 to T=6, there are 4 actions: a_2 (for T=2 to T=3), a_3 (T=3 to T=4), a_4 (T=4 to T=5), a_5 (T=5 to T=6). So 4 actions to determine y_3, y_4, y_5, y_6.\n\ny_2 = 2\n\nAfter a_2: y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nAfter a_3: y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\nAfter a_4: y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nAfter a_5: y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_6 must not be 5,6, or 7.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and we want to go up, y_6 should be as high as possible but not 5,6,7.\n\nSo possible y_6: 4 or 8 or 9, but 9 might be too high.\n\ny_6 <= y_2 + 4 = 6, since max +1 per turn, 4 steps up, y_2=2, y_6 <=6.\n\ny_6 >= y_2 -4 = -2, but y min 0, so y_6 between 0 and 6.\n\nSpecifically, min y_6=0, max y_6=6.\n\nNow, we need y_6 not 5,6,7, but 7 is impossible since max 6, so y_6 cannot be 5 or 6.\n\nTherefore, y_6 must be <=4 or >=8, but >=8 impossible since max 6, so y_6 <=4.\n\ny_6 must be 4 or less.\n\nBut y_6 <=4.\n\nSince we want to go to y=9 eventually, having y_6 <=4 might cost extra moves later.\n\ny_6 <=4, but we start from y=2, so it's possible to be at y=4 at T=6 with some up and down.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nTo have y_6 <=4.\n\nFor example, if we stay or go down sometimes.\n\nBut we can go up to y=4 and stay or something.\n\nNow, after T=6, we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y_6 <=4 at T=6, to y=9, need at least 5 up moves (since 9-4=5), so from T=6 onwards, at least 5 turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut we have other dangers: at T=8 and T=9, if we are on y=2,3,4, collision.\n\ny=2,3,4 dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, if we are at y_6 <=4 at T=6.\n\nThen from T=6 to T=8: two actions, a_6 and a_7, to set y_7 and y_8.\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nAt T=8, y_8 must not be in {2,3,4} if we are to avoid collision, but y=2,3,4 dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo if y_8 is 2,3, or 4, and we are at T=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some T_final.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we must not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nNow, back to T=6.\n\ny_6 <=4.\n\nSuppose we aim to be at y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen from T=6, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny_6=4\n\nT=6: at y=4, safe? At T=6, y=4: freeway 4, collision only at T=8,9, not T=6, so safe.\n\nChoose a_6: if U, then y_7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5. Collision at T=6? T=6 is past, at T=7, for y=5: cars, at T=7, first car span: min = -59 +12(7-2) = -59 +12*5 = -59+60=1, max= -48+60=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, safe. Second car min=13+60=73>0, safe. So y=5 at T=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U, y_7=5, safe.\n\nThen T=7: y=5, safe, choose a_7.\n\nIf U, y_8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6. Collision at T=6 only, not T=8, so safe? At T=8, y=6: cars, first car min= -59 +12(6)= -59+72=13? T-2=6, min=-59+72=13, max=-48+72=24, 0 not in. Second car min=13+72=85>0, safe. So y=6 at T=8 safe.\n\nBut now, at T=8, we are on y=6, which is not 2,3,4, so no problem for T=8 danger.\n\nBut we need to check for y=2,3,4 at T=8.\n\nHere y=6, not 2,3,4.\n\nNow, continue: at T=8, y=6, safe, choose a_8: if U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7. At T=9, min first car -59+12*7= -59+84=25>0, safe. Then a_9: U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8. At T=10, min1= -35 +12(8)= -35+96=61>0, safe. a_10: U, y_11=9\n\nT=11: y=9, reached.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from t_1, I think.\n\nt_1=2, we start at turn 2.\n\nSequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nHere, from T=2 to T=11, y=9 at T=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=2 to T=3, ..., to T=11, that's 9 actions? Let's see.\n\nTurns: at T=2, we are at y=2, we take actions a_2 to a_10 to reach y_11=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is T=11.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have moved H steps in time, so at turn t_1 + H, we are at the new position.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 +1}, to y_{t_1 +2} at turn t_1 +2.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t_1 + H} at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=2, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn my earlier, at T=11, y=9, so t_1 + H =11, so 2 + H =11, H=9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn this path, we had y_6 <=4, but in this example I set y_6=4, then went up, reached at T=11.\n\nBut y_6 could be lower, but we can be higher as long as not 5,6.\n\nBut y_6 max 6, but cannot be 5 or 6, so must be <=4.\n\ny_6 <=4.\n\nBut with y_6=4, we can go up directly to y=9 in 5 more turns, from T=6 to T=11, but T=6 to T=11 is 5 turns: T=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nActions from a_6 to a_10, 5 actions, to reach y_11=9.\n\nBut we have the danger at T=8 and T=9 for y=2,3,4.\n\nIn this path, at T=8, we were at y=6, not 2,3,4.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, not 2,3,4.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nMinimum from start: from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, so minimum H=7, with y_9=9? Let's see.\n\nIf we go up every turn from T=2:\n\nT=2: y=2, safe, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, safe, a3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, safe, a4=U, y5=5\n\nT=5: y=5, safe (since T=5 not T=6), a5=U, y6=6\n\nBut T=6: y=6, collision! Not possible.\n\nSo we must avoid y=6 at T=6.\n\nThus, in the direct path, we have problem at T=6.\n\nTo avoid, we need y_6 <=4.\n\nFor example, at some point before T=6, we go down or stay to have lower y at T=6.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, we can go down to y=1.\n\nFor instance, suppose at T=2: y=2, safe, we could do S or D to stay or go down.\n\nBut we want to minimize time, so probably go up when possible.\n\nSo, to have y_6 <=4.\n\ny_2=2\n\nAfter 4 actions (a2 to a5), y_6 = 2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1\n\nSo y_6 between -2 and 6, but y>=0, so 0 to 6.\n\nWe need y_6 <=4.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we want y_6 as high as possible, so y_6=4 is best, since 5 and 6 forbidden.\n\nSo aim for y_6=4.\n\nHow to get to y=4 at T=6 with minimal delay.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=2, to y=4 at T=6.\n\nIn 4 actions, we can go from 2 to 4 with 2 up and 2 other moves, but since we need net +2, we can do two U and two S, for example, or one U and one D and two S, but net +2 requires two U and two moves with zero net, like S or U and D cancel.\n\nBut to save time, we should not go down unnecessarily.\n\nSo best: do two U and two S, so we stay at some points.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\ny_6=4.\n\nThen from T=6, y=4, we need to go to y=9, which requires 5 up moves.\n\nNow, we have to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, from T=6, y=4.\n\nT=6: y=4, safe, choose a6.\n\nSuppose a6=U, then y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, safe (as before), choose a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, safe? As before, at T=8, y=6 is safe, not dangerous.\n\nThen a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, safe? At T=9, y=7, freeway 7, cars min at T=9: -59 +12(7)= -59+84=25>0, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, safe? At T=10, y=8, min1= -35 +12(8)= -35+96=61>0, safe.\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11: y=9, reached.\n\nH=9 actions? From a2 to a10, that's 9 actions? t from 2 to 10, that's 9 turns? Let's count.\n\nActions: a_t for t=2 to t=10, that's t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: 9 actions.\n\nAfter a10, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H =11, t_1=2, so H=9.\n\nBut we can do better by being higher earlier or avoiding the T=8,9 danger differently.\n\nSince y_6 must be <=4, but we can be on y=8 at T=6? No, impossible, max y_6=6.\n\ny_6 <=4.\n\nBut at T=8, if we are not on y=2,3,4, we are fine.\n\nIn the above, at T=8 we are on y=6, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly T=9 on y=7, fine.\n\nBut we reached at T=11.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 before T=11.\n\nBut from y_6=4 at T=6, minimum to y=9 is 5 steps, so T=11 is earliest possible from there.\n\nBut y_6 could be less, but that would take longer to reach y=9, so worse.\n\ny_6=4 is best.\n\nBut is there a way to have y_6 higher? No, because y_6 cannot be 5 or 6.\n\nUnless we are on y=8 or 9 at T=6, but impossible from start.\n\nAnother idea: go up fast but at T=5, instead of going to y=5, we go down or something.\n\nLet's list the positions.\n\nWe need to not be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nT=6 position y_6.\n\nBut y_6 depends on previous actions.\n\nWe also have actions before.\n\nAt T=5, we are at y_5, then a5 determines y_6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo avoid y_6=5,6,7, we can choose a5 such that if y_5 would lead to bad y_6, we adjust.\n\nBut y_5 itself might be constrained.\n\nStart:\n\nT=2: y=2, safe. Choose a2.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible except at critical points.\n\nSince T=6 is the only critical point for middle rows, and we need to be low there.\n\nBut then we have to deal with T=8,9 later.\n\nIn the above path with y_6=4, we avoided T=6 danger, and at T=8,9 we were not on y=2,3,4, so it worked with H=9.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster by being on y=8 or something at T=6, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 at T=7 or something.\n\nAnother thought: the danger at T=6 is only for that instant, so if we pass through quickly, but no, because at each turn, we are on a position, and we check at that turn.\n\nFor example, if at T=6 we are on y=4, safe, then at T=7 we go to y=5, which is safe at T=7, etc.\n\nBut we cannot skip T=6; we have to be at some y at T=6.\n\nUnless we move so that at T=6 we are not on the dangerous rows.\n\nBut as above, y_6 <=4 or y_6=8,9 but impossible.\n\nSo must be <=4.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should reach y=4 at T=6 with as few down moves as possible, ideally no down moves.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=2 to y=4 at T=6.\n\nIn 4 actions, net change +2.\n\nWe can do, for example:\n\n- Two U and two S: actions U,U,S,S in some order.\n\n- Or U,S,U,S etc.\n\n- Or even U,D,U,U but that has a down, which might not be efficient.\n\nBest to do U and S only.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=2: y=2, a2=U, so y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nNow at T=4, y=4.\n\nWe need y_6=4, so from T=4 to T=6, we need to stay at y=4 or go down and up, but better to stay.\n\nSo at T=4: y=4, safe, choose a4=S, then y5=4\n\nT=5: y=5? y5=4, at T=5, position y=4, safe (since collision only at T=8,9 for y=4).\n\nThen choose a5=S, so y6=4\n\nThen T=6: y=4, safe.\n\nNow from here, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=6, y=4.\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, safe, a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, safe, a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, safe, a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, safe, a10=U, y11=9\n\nStill T=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter T=4 y=4, we could go up earlier, but we need to have y_6=4, so if at T=4 we go up, y5=5, then at T=5 y=5, safe, but then to have y6=4, we need to go down at T=5: a5=D, so y6=4.\n\nThen T=6: y=4, safe.\n\nThen same as above: a6=U, y7=5, T=7 y=5, a7=U, y8=6, T=8 y=6, a8=U, y9=7, T=9 y=7, a9=U, y10=8, T=10 y=8, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nStill H=9.\n\nBut in this case, we went down at T=5, which might not be necessary, but same number of turns.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at T=6, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at y=4 at T=6; we could be lower, but that would take longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if y_6=3, then to y=9 need 6 up moves, so T=12, worse.\n\nSo y_6=4 is best.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the T=8,9 danger by being at y=9 before T=8.\n\nT=8 is turn 8.\n\nFrom start T=2, to reach y=9, minimum 7 up moves, so at turn 9 we can be at y=9 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut in that case, at T=6 we would be at y=6, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we go up faster but with the constraint.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=1 at some point to wait, but that might add moves.\n\nFor example, at T=2: y=2, a2=D, y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1, safe, a3=S, y4=1\n\nT=4: y=1, a4=S, y5=1\n\nT=5: y=1, a5=S, y6=1\n\nThen T=6: y=1, safe.\n\nThen from here, go up: a6=U, y7=2\n\nT=7: y=2, safe? At T=7, y=2: freeway 2, min at T=7: -47 +6(5)= -47+30= -17 <=0? max= -36+30= -6, -6<0, so 0 not in [-17,-6], since 0 > max? max=-6<0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\na7=U, y8=3\n\nT=8: y=3, but at T=8, y=3 is dangerous! Collision for y=3 at T=8.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt T=8, if on y=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U to y=3 at T=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom T=6 y=1, we could go up faster to skip y=2,3,4 before T=8.\n\nBut T=8 is soon.\n\nAt T=6: y=1\n\na6=U, y7=2\n\nT=7: y=2, safe, a7=U, y8=3\n\nBut at T=8, y=3, collision.\n\nIf at T=7, we go U to y=3, then at T=8 y=3, collision.\n\nIf we go S at T=7, y8=2, then at T=8 y=2, also collision for y=2 at T=8.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf we go D at T=7, y8=1, then at T=8 y=1, safe, but then we are at y=1, far from 9.\n\nThen need to go up later, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, a7=D, y8=1, T=8 y=1, safe, then a8=U, y9=2, but at T=9, y=2, collision for y=2 at T=9.\n\nT=9 also dangerous.\n\nSo we need to avoid y=2,3,4 at both T=8 and T=9.\n\nFrom T=8 onwards, we must not be on y=2,3,4 until after T=9.\n\nBut after T=9, it might be ok, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe danger is only at T=8 and T=9, so if we are not on y=2,3,4 at those exact turns, we are fine.\n\nFor example, at T=8, be on y=1 or y=5 or higher, and similarly at T=9.\n\nIn the first path, we were on y=6 at T=8 and y=7 at T=9, which are fine.\n\nTo reach earlier, we need to be higher earlier.\n\nBut at T=6 we are constrained to be low.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 by T=10 or something.\n\nMinimum possible: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, but with constraint at T=6.\n\nSuppose we do some down move to avoid being at high y at T=6.\n\nFor example, start: T=2: y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nNow at T=5, y=5, safe.\n\nTo avoid y6=6, we can choose a5 not U.\n\nIf a5=S, then y6=5, but y=5 at T=6 is dangerous! Collision.\n\nIf a5=D, then y6=4, which is safe at T=6.\n\nThen proceed.\n\ny6=4\n\nThen T=6: y=4, safe, a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, safe, a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, safe, a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, safe, a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, safe, a10=U, y11=9\n\nAgain T=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter y7=5 at T=7, we go U to y8=6 at T=8, safe.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7.\n\nTo reach earlier, from y7=5 at T=7, if we go U, y8=6 at T=8, then to y9=7 at T=9, then y10=8, y11=9.\n\nCan we be at y=8 at T=8?\n\nFrom start, at T=8, y=8.\n\ny_8 = y_2 + sum Δy from t=2 to t=7, 6 actions.\n\ny_2=2, max y_8=2+6=8.\n\nBut to have y_8=8, we need all U from T=2 to T=7.\n\nBut then at T=6, y_6 would be y_2 + Δy2+Δy3+Δy4+Δy5.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=6, 4 actions, y_6 <=6.\n\nIf all U, y_6=6, but at T=6, y=6 collision, not possible.\n\nIf we have one S or D, y_6<6, so y_8<8 if not all U.\n\nFor example, if y_6=5, but y_6=5 at T=6 collision, not allowed.\n\ny_6 must be <=4, so y_6<=4, then after two more actions to y_8, y_8 <= y_6 +2 <=6, so y_8<=6, cannot be 8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, max y=6 if y_6=4 and two U.\n\nIn that case, y_8=6, as in the path.\n\nThen y_9=7, y_10=8, y_11=9.\n\nSo it seems H=9 is the best we can do.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach at T=10.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H =10, H=8.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nFrom y_2=2 to y_10=9, need net +7 in 8 actions, so possible, e.g., 7U and 1S.\n\nBut we have the T=6 constraint.\n\ny_6 must be defined.\n\nAt T=6, y_6 must not be 5,6,7.\n\ny_6 between 0 and 6.\n\nSuppose we do 7U and 1S in the 8 actions from a2 to a9 (since actions a2 to a9 determine y3 to y10, 8 actions for 8 steps? Actions: a_t for t=2 to t=9, that's 8 actions, to reach y_10 at turn 10.\n\ny_10 = y_2 + sum_{k=2 to 9} Δy_k\n\n9-2+1=8 actions? t from 2 to 9 inclusive, that's 8 values: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter a9, at turn 10, y_10.\n\nWe want y_10=9.\n\ny_2=2, so sum Δy from k=2 to9 must be +7.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1, so we need 7 U and 1 other move, which must be S or D.\n\nIf S, net +7, y_10=9.\n\nIf D, net +6, y_10=8, not 9.\n\nSo must have 7 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, the S can be at any point.\n\nBut we need to avoid y_6 being 5 or 6.\n\ny_6 = y_2 + sum_{k=2 to 5} Δy_k? y_6 depends on actions up to a5.\n\nActions: a2, a3, a4, a5 determine y_6.\n\ny_6 = 2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nWe need y_6 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we have 7 U and 1 S.\n\nThe S must be one of the actions from a2 to a9.\n\nIf the S is before a5, it helps to keep y_6 low.\n\nFor example, suppose we do S at T=4.\n\nThen:\n\nT=2: y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, a4=S, y5=4\n\nT=5: y=4, a5=U, y6=5\n\nBut y6=5 at T=6, collision! Not good.\n\na5=U would make y6=5, dangerous.\n\nIf at T=5, we do not U, but S or D.\n\nBut we need to have the S somewhere.\n\nSuppose at T=5, we do S: a5=S, y6=4? From y5=4, a5=S, y6=4.\n\nThen y6=4, safe.\n\nBut we used a S at T=5.\n\nThen actions left: from a6 to a9, we need to go from y6=4 to y10=9, which requires 5 U, but only 4 actions: a6,a7,a8,a9.\n\ny10 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny6=4, y10=9, need +5, but 4 actions, each max +1, so max y10=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we have S at T=5, then from y6=4 to y10, with 4 actions, max y10=8, not 9.\n\nIf we do U at T=5, but then y6=5, collision.\n\nIf we do D at T=5, y6=3, then from y6=3 to y10=9 need +6 in 4 actions, impossible.\n\nSo if we have a S before or at T=5, we cannot reach y10=9 because not enough actions to gain height after T=6.\n\nThe S must be after T=5.\n\nThat is, from a6 to a9, one of them is S.\n\nBut we need all U except one S to have net +7 in 8 actions.\n\nActions a2 to a9: 8 actions, 7U and 1S.\n\ny_6 = 2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nΔy2 to Δy5: four actions.\n\nTo have y_6 <=4.\n\nSince we have 7U in total, but only four actions for y_6, so if all four are U, y_6=6, but not allowed.\n\nIf three U and one S in first four actions, y_6 = 2 +3 +0 =5, but y_6=5 at T=6 collision, not allowed.\n\nIf two U and two S, y_6=2+2+0=4, ok.\n\nIf one U and three S, y_6=2+1+0=3, ok, but lower.\n\nOr with D, but D would make y_6 lower, worse.\n\nSo possible: two U and two S in actions a2 to a5, so y_6=4.\n\nThen for actions a6 to a9: we need to go from y6=4 to y10=9, which requires +5, but only four actions, so we need all U, but we have one S in the remaining, contradiction.\n\nActions a6 to a9 are four actions, to set y7 to y10.\n\ny10 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny6=4, y10=9, need +5, so all four actions must be U, but we have only 7U in total, and we used two U in first four, so in last four, we need five U, but only four actions, impossible.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nTotal actions a2 to a9: eight actions.\n\nWe must have seven U and one S.\n\nFor the first four actions (a2 to a5): to have y_6 <=4, with y_2=2, we need the sum of Δy for a2 to a5 to be <=2.\n\nSince each U is +1, S is 0, D is -1.\n\nNet change from y2 to y6 is Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5.\n\ny6 = 2 + (Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5)\n\nSet S = Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nS <= 2, and since y6 <=4, S <=2.\n\nBut S can be from -4 to 4.\n\nWe need S <=2 for y6<=4? y6=2+S <=4, so S<=2.\n\nBut we also need to avoid y6=5 or6, which requires S<=2, since S=3 would be y6=5, S=4 y6=6.\n\nNow, S <=2.\n\nNow, in the four actions a2 to a5, the number of U, S, D.\n\nLet U be number of U, etc.\n\nU + S_count + D =4\n\nNet S = U - D\n\ny6=2 + (U - D)\n\nSet U - D <=2\n\nBut we have total seven U in eight actions, so in a2 to a5, U can be from 0 to 4.\n\nBut U - D <=2.\n\nNow, for the last four actions a6 to a9, we need y10=9, y6=2 + (U - D) from first.\n\ny10 = y6 + (Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9) = [2 + (U - D)] + (U_last - D_last)\n\nWhere U_last is number of U in a6-a9, similarly.\n\nTotal U: U_first + U_last =7\n\nTotal actions: 4 first + 4 last =8, with one S somewhere.\n\nThe S is one action, so either in first or last.\n\nNow, y10 = 2 + (U_first - D_first) + (U_last - D_last)\n\nBut U_first + U_last =7\n\nD_first + D_last = let's say D_total\n\nS_total =1, since one S.\n\nU_total + S_total + D_total =8, U_total=7, S_total=1, so D_total=0.\n\nNo down moves, only U and S.\n\nSo D_first=0, D_last=0.\n\nThen y10 = 2 + (U_first - 0) + (U_last - 0) = 2 + U_first + U_last = 2 +7 =9, good.\n\ny6 = 2 + U_first\n\nSince D_first=0.\n\ny6 =2 + U_first\n\nNow y6 must <=4, so 2 + U_first <=4, so U_first <=2.\n\nAlso, since U_first <=4.\n\nNow, U_first <=2.\n\nThen U_last =7 - U_first >=5.\n\nBut U_last is for four actions, U_last <=4, so U_last <=4, but U_last >=5 if U_first<=2, contradiction, since U_first <=2 implies U_last >=5, but U_last <=4 impossible.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y10=9 with H=8.\n\nTherefore, H=9 is the minimum.\n\nWith H=9, we can do as before.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nIn the first approach, with y_6=4.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart T=2: y=2, action a2=U, so y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, action a3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, action a4=S, y5=4\n\nT=5: y=5? y5=4, position at T=5 is y=4, safe.\n\nAction a5=S, so y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, safe.\n\nAction a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, safe.\n\nAction a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, safe.\n\nAction a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, safe.\n\nAction a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, safe.\n\nAction a10=U, y11=9\n\nAt T=11, y=9.\n\nActions from a2 to a10, H=9 actions.\n\nt from 2 to 10, that's 9 turns: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAfter a10, turn 11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a4=S and a5=S, but we could have different.\n\nTo have fewer S, but we need to stay or something.\n\nAnother sequence: at T=4, after y4=4, we could go up, but then down at T=5.\n\nT=2: a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3: a3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nT=5: y=5, safe (T=5 not T=6), action a5=D, so y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, safe.\n\nThen a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, a10=U, y11=9\n\nSame thing, but we have a down move, which is fine, but same number of turns.\n\nIn this case, we used a D, but no S, but we have to have the actions.\n\nIn terms of the car states, we need to ensure no collision, which we have.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the sequence from turn t_1=2.\n\nSo actions: turn 2: U, turn 3: U, turn 4: U, turn 5: D, turn 6: U, turn 7: U, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U\n\nIn this sequence: at turn 2: U, to y3=3\n\nTurn 3: U, to y4=4\n\nTurn 4: U, to y5=5\n\nTurn 5: D, to y6=4\n\nTurn 6: U, to y7=5\n\nTurn 7: U, to y8=6\n\nTurn 8: U, to y9=7\n\nTurn 9: U, to y10=8\n\nTurn 10: U, to y11=9\n\nAnd at each turn, no collision, as per earlier checks.\n\nAt turn 5: y=5, which is safe because T=5 not T=6.\n\nAt turn 6: y=4, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nWith the S version: turn 2: U, turn 3: U, turn 4: S, turn 5: S, turn 6: U, turn 7: U, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U\n\nIn this case, at turn 4: S, so y5=4 (since a4=S, y5=y4=4)\n\nThen turn 5: S, y6=4\n\nThen turn 6: U, y7=5, etc.\n\nBoth work.\n\nThe S version has two S, which might be considered waiting, but same turns.\n\nNow, for the output, we need minimal H, which is 9, and a sequence.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, we have to reach at turn 11.\n\nBut the answer should be the actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=2, H=9, so actions from turn 2 to turn 2+8=10? t_1 + H -1 = 2 + 9 -1 =10.\n\nActions: a2 to a10.\n\nThen after a10, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, let's write one.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D  (to avoid going to y=5 at T=5 and then down, but in this case we go to y=5 and down)\n\nOr with S:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the S version, at turn 4: S, and turn 5: S, which might be fine.\n\nBut to have fewer non-up moves, the first with D has only one non-up.\n\nBut both are acceptable.\n\nNow, we also need to check if we can start differently.\n\nSuppose at T=2, we do not go up, but stay or down, but that would delay, probably worse.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=1 and wait, but as before, we might hit T=8,9 danger.\n\nBut in this case, with H=9, it should be ok.\n\nAnother thing: at T=8 and T=9, we were not on y=2,3,4, so no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=8, we are on y=6, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly T=9 on y=7.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn this, turn 5: D, which is down, but since we are at y=5, going down to y=4.\n\nBut at T=5, y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen up to 9.\n\nTo avoid down, we can use the S version.\n\nBut either is fine.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence with S.\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn this, at turn 4: S, so we stay at y=4 for T=4 and T=5.\n\nThen at turn 6: U to y=5, etc.\n\nBoth sequences reach at turn 11.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nAlso, we need to make sure about the car at y=8 at T=4, but we are not there, so fine.\n\nI think H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence can be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the action, turn 5: D, but D is down, from y=5 to y=4.\n\nSince y=5 at T=5 is safe, and going down.\n\nTo have only up and stay, the other sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be clear.\n\nPerhaps use the S version to avoid down.\n\nBut the problem allows D, so it should be fine.\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 5: D, but let's list the positions to confirm.\n\nT=2: y=2, action U\n\nT=3: y=3, action U\n\nT=4: y=4, action U? In the sequence I have turn 4: U, so from y=4, action U, to y5=5\n\nAt T=4, position y=4, safe.\n\nAction a4=U, so y5=5\n\nT=5: position y=5, which is freeway 5, at T=5: as before, not dangerous, safe.\n\nAction a5=D, so y6=4\n\nT=6: position y=4, freeway 4, at T=6: not dangerous (danger at T=8,9), safe.\n\nAction a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5, at T=7: safe, as min=1>0? Earlier for y=5 at T=7: min1= -59 +12(5)= -59+60=1, max1=12, 0 not in [1,12], safe.\n\nAction a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6, at T=8: min1= -59 +12(6)= -59+72=13>0, safe.\n\nAction a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7, at T=9: min1= -59+12(7)= -59+84=25>0, safe.\n\nAction a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8, at T=10: min1= -35+12(8)= -35+96=61>0, safe.\n\nAction a10=U, y11=9\n\nReached.\n\nWith S sequence: turn 2:U, turn3:U, turn4:S, turn5:S, turn6:U, turn7:U, turn8:U, turn9:U, turn10:U\n\nT=2: y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, a4=S, y5=4\n\nT=5: y=4?

The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at critical turns.\n\n- At turn \\(T = 6\\), freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) are dangerous due to car collisions. The player must not be on these freeways at this turn.\n- At turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are dangerous. The player must not be on these freeways at these turns.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 2 with the player at \\(y = 2\\). By taking actions that include moving up, down, or staying, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 (after 9 actions from turn 2 to turn 10).\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 2: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 3. At turn 2, \\(y = 2\\) is safe.\n- Turn 3: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 4. At turn 3, \\(y = 3\\) is safe.\n- Turn 4: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 5. At turn 4, \\(y = 4\\) is safe.\n- Turn 5: Move down (D) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6. At turn 5, \\(y = 5\\) is safe (not dangerous at \\(T = 5\\)).\n- Turn 6: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7. At turn 6, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (not dangerous at \\(T = 6\\)).\n- Turn 7: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8. At turn 7, \\(y = 5\\) is safe.\n- Turn 8: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9. At turn 8, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (not dangerous at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10. At turn 9, \\(y = 7\\) is safe (not dangerous at \\(T = 9\\)).\n- Turn 10: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. At turn 10, \\(y = 8\\) is safe.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, with \\(H = 9\\) actions starting from turn 2. No shorter sequence is possible due to the constraints at \\(T = 6\\), \\(T = 8\\), and \\(T = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 3, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, based on the car state table. For each freeway, there are cars with given positions and speeds.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, then collision occurs.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=3 and need to get to y=9, I need to increase my y-coordinate. Each U action increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6, if I just go up each turn. But I might hit cars, so I need to avoid collisions.\n\nI need to check for each freeway, when I might be on it, whether at that turn, the car spans cover x=0.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=3, and I need to compute for future turns T > 3.\n\nLet me denote the time from current turn: let τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn t_1.\n\nFor a car, at τ=0, span is [h, τ] or [τ, h] depending on direction, but since all are right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head > tail, so Span = [tail, head] I think.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in Span(T) for the freeway I'm on at turn T.\n\nSpan(T) is a interval, so 0 is in it if τ + s*(T-t_1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*(T-t_1)\n\nSince the car is moving right, and x=0 is the point we care about.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have the cars at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=57, tail τ=46, direction right, speed s=3. Since right, span at τ=0 is [46,57]? Tail τ=46, head h=57, so [τ, h] = [46,57]\n\nThen at time τ (from now), Span = [46 + 3τ, 57 + 3τ]\n\n0 is in this if 46 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ 57 + 3τ, but 46 + 3τ is always positive for τ≥0, since 46>0, so 0 < 46 + 3τ ≤ 57 + 3τ, so 0 is never ≤ 46 + 3τ? 46+3τ >0, so 0 cannot be in [46+3τ, 57+3τ] since left endpoint >0. So for freeway 1, at no time is 0 covered. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nTail τ=-41, head h=-30? But -30 > -41, so if right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [-41, -30] at τ=0.\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s*ΔT, h + s*ΔT] = [-41 + 6τ, -30 + 6τ]\n\n0 is in this if -41 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6τ\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-41 + 6τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6τ ≤ 41 ⇒ τ ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\n0 ≤ -30 + 6τ ⇒ 6τ ≥ 30 ⇒ τ ≥ 5\n\nSo for 5 ≤ τ ≤ 6.833, since τ integer? Turns are discrete, so τ integer.\n\nτ = T - t_1, integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nSo τ ≥ 0 integer.\n\nSo τ from 5 to 6 inclusive? τ=5,6.\n\nτ=5: -41 + 6*5 = -41 + 30 = -11 ≤ 0, and -30 + 30 = 0 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ 0 is true, so yes.\n\n-41 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6τ\n\nFor τ=5: -41 + 30 = -11 ≤ 0, and 0 ≤ -30 + 30 = 0, so 0 ≤ 0 true.\n\nFor τ=6: -41 + 36 = -5 ≤ 0, and 0 ≤ -30 + 36 = 6, true.\n\nFor τ=7: -41 + 42 =1 >0, so -5? -41+42=1, which is >0, so left end is 1, 0<1, not ≤, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly τ=4: -41+24= -17 ≤0, but 0 ≤ -30 +24= -6? 0 ≤ -6 false.\n\nSo only τ=5 and τ=6, 0 is covered on freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 has only one car, and it covers x=0 at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nτ=5 and τ=6 relative to now, turn t_1=3.\n\nSo at absolute turn T = t_1 + τ = 3 + τ.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT = t_1 + τ = 3 + τ.\n\nτ=5: T=3+5=8\n\nτ=6: T=3+6=9\n\nSo at turn 8 and 9, if on freeway 2, collision.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-30, -41, right, 6) same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: (-30, -41, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same, collision at T=8 and T=9 if on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-30, -41, right, 6) same. So freeway 4 also collision at T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nTail τ=-47, head h=-36\n\nSpan at τ: [-47 + 12τ, -36 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: -47 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12τ\n\n-47 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 47 ⇒ τ ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916\n\n0 ≤ -36 + 12τ ⇒ 12τ ≥ 36 ⇒ τ ≥ 3\n\nSo τ=3, since τ integer.\n\nτ=3: -47 + 36 = -11 ≤ 0, 0 ≤ -36 + 36 =0, true.\n\nτ=4: -47 + 48 =1 >0, not ≤0? left end 1>0, so 0 not in [1, -36+48=12], since 0<1.\n\nSo only τ=3.\n\nThus at τ=3, T=3+3=6, collision on freeway 5 for first car.\n\nBut there is a second car: (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nHead h=36, tail τ=25? Tail=25, head=36, right, so span [25,36] at τ=0.\n\nSpan τ: [25 + 12τ, 36 + 12τ]\n\nSince 25+12τ >0 for τ≥0, always positive, so 0 never in it. So safe.\n\nThus for freeway 5, only the first car causes collision at τ=3, T=6.\n\nSo at turn 6, if on freeway 5, collision.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car same, so collision at τ=3, T=6.\n\nSecond car safe.\n\nSo freeway 6 collision at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), so collision at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: tail τ=-23, head h=-12, right, speed 12.\n\nSpan τ: [-23 + 12τ, -12 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: -23 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12τ\n\n-23 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 23 ⇒ τ ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916\n\n0 ≤ -12 + 12τ ⇒ 12τ ≥ 12 ⇒ τ ≥ 1\n\nSo τ=1 and τ=2? τ integer.\n\nτ=1: -23 + 12 = -11 ≤ 0, 0 ≤ -12 + 12 =0, true.\n\nτ=2: -23 + 24 =1 ≤0? 1 ≤0 false, left end=1>0, so 0 not in [1, -12+24=12]\n\n-23 + 12τ for τ=2: -23+24=1\n\n0 ≤ 1? The inequality is 0 ≤ -12 +12τ for τ=2: 0 ≤ -12+24=12, true, but left end is 1, so 0 <1, not ≥ left end.\n\nSo for 0 to be in [L,R], need L ≤ 0 ≤ R.\n\nFor τ=1: L= -23+12= -11 ≤0, R= -12+12=0, so -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, true.\n\nτ=2: L= -23+24=1, R=12, 1 ≤ 0 ≤12? 1≤0 false, so not.\n\nτ=0: L=-23, R=-12, both negative, -23≤0≤-12? 0≤-12 false.\n\nSo only τ=1.\n\nThus at τ=1, T=3+1=4, collision for first car on freeway 8.\n\nNow second car: (36,25,right,12), same as before, always safe, since 25+12τ>0.\n\nSo freeway 8 has collision at T=4.\n\nNow, freeway 1 we said always safe.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4: collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5,6,7: collision at T=6\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=4\n\nAlso, freeway 9? But we don't care, since we need to reach y=9, and y=9 has no freeway? The freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player is on the grid, but cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at turn t_1=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so min H=6 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might hit cars.\n\nLet me see the unsafe times for each y.\n\nSince I need to be on each freeway at certain times.\n\nBut I can stay or move, so I can be on the same y multiple turns.\n\nThe unsafe times:\n\nFor each freeway, the turns when it is unsafe.\n\nFreeway y=1: always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=4\n\nAlso, at other times, they are safe.\n\nNow, I start at T=3, y=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=3, is it safe? y=3 is freeway 3, which has collision only at T=8 and T=9, not at T=3, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nTurn T=3: at y=3, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=4 at next turn.\n\nTurn T=4: now I am on y=4 at turn T=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, but T=4 not unsafe, so should be safe? But freeway 4 has cars, but collision only at T=8,9, not at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, for freeway 4, τ = T - t_1 = T-3, since t_1=3.\n\nT=4, τ=1.\n\nFor freeway 4, car (-30,-41,right,6), span at τ=1: [-41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 not in [-35,-24], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y=4 is safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 is unsafe at T=4, but I'm not on y=8.\n\nNow, at T=4, I am on y=4, and I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U, to y=5 at T=5.\n\nT=5: on y=5.\n\ny=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at T=6, not at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, τ=2, freeway 5 first car: [-47 +12*2, -36 +12*2] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12], 0 not in it.\n\nSecond car [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], not 0.\n\nSo safe at T=5.\n\nThen action U, to y=6 at T=6.\n\nT=6: on y=6.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at T=6, because freeway 6 collision at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, τ=3, freeway 6 first car: [-47 +12*3, -36 +12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 in [-11,0], yes collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at T=6, also collision.\n\nIn this path, at T=6 I am on y=6, collision.\n\nIf I had gone to y=5 at T=6, but T=6 y=5 also collision.\n\nIn the sequence: from T=3 y=3, U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nT=4 y=4, U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nT=5 y=5, U to y=6 at T=6 → collision at T=6 on y=6.\n\nIf I stay at T=5, but I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower or faster.\n\nMinimal H is 6, but at T=6 I need to be at y=9? No.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nI start at turn T=3, position (0,3).\n\nAfter action, at turn T=4, I am at new position.\n\nThe sequence: at turn T, I am at y_T, and I perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T and 0 in car span on y_T at time T.\n\nIn this case, at T=6, if I am on y=6, collision.\n\nBut at T=6, I might not be on y=6.\n\nIn the direct path, I would be on y=6 at T=6.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be on y=5,6,7 at T=6, since all unsafe at T=6.\n\ny=5,6,7 all unsafe at T=6.\n\nAlso, y=8 unsafe at T=4.\n\ny=2,3,4 unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI start at T=3, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are unsafe at T=6, I should avoid being on them at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 is unsafe at T=4, so avoid on y=8 at T=4.\n\nNow, possible to delay or something.\n\nSince min steps is 6, but I might need to take more steps to avoid.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster or slower.\n\nFrom y=3, I can go U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, if I go U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, if I go U to y=6 at T=6, but T=6 y=6 collision.\n\nIf at T=5 I go S, stay at y=5, then at T=6 on y=5, collision, since y=5 unsafe at T=6.\n\nIf at T=5 I go D to y=4 at T=6, but y=4 at T=6 is safe? y=4 unsafe only at T=8,9, not T=6.\n\nAt T=6, τ=3, freeway 4: car [-41 +6*3, -30 +6*3] = [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut if I go D from y=5 to y=4 at T=5, then at T=6 I am on y=4.\n\nBut I was at y=5 at T=5, which is safe, then D to y=4.\n\nBut then I am going down, away from goal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nAt T=4, instead of going U, I could go S or something.\n\nLet's list all unsafe (y,T) pairs.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, on freeway y, and 0 in car span on y at T.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=4\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=0 and y=9: no cars, always safe.\n\nAt T=3, y=3 safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn, and I need minimal H such that after H turns, I am at y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to now.\n\nStart at turn t_1, after 0 actions, position at turn t_1.\n\nAfter first action at turn t_1, move to new position at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + t, position at turn (t_1 + t) + 1? Let's see.\n\nThe action a_t is applied at turn t, and determines the delta y for the next position.\n\nFrom the player update: at turn t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t.\n\nSo after action at turn t, new position at turn t+1.\n\nSo for sequence from t=0 to H-1 relative, but in absolute time.\n\nAt turn T = t_1, position y_{t_1} = 3.\n\nThen action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen action a_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1, determines y_{t_1 +2}\n\n...\n\nAction a_{t_1 + H-1} at turn t_1 + H-1, determines y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the collision, at each turn T, when we are at position (0, y_T), we check if collision at that turn T.\n\nFor turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1? When are we on the grid?\n\nAt turn T, we are at (0, y_T), and if y_T between 1 and 8, we check collision based on cars at that turn.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at (0,9), no collision, so we don't care about turn t_1 + H for collision, only for reaching.\n\nCollision can happen from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, I think, because at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nLet's confirm.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, if 1≤ y_T ≤8, collision possible.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, no collision.\n\nSo for turns T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we need no collision, and at T= t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, H=6, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps: actions U,U,U,U,U,U, positions: T=3 y=3, T=4 y=4, T=5 y=5, T=6 y=6, T=7 y=7, T=8 y=8, T=9 y=9.\n\nBut at T=6, y=6, collision as we saw.\n\nAlso, at T=8, y=8, but y=8 is unsafe at T=8? y=8 unsafe at T=4, but not at T=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=4.\n\nAt T=8, y=8: freeway 8, τ = T-3 =5, car spans.\n\nFirst car: [-23 +12*5, -12 +12*5] = [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+12*5,36+60]= [25+60,36+60]=[85,96], not 0. So safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, T=6 y=6 collision.\n\nIn the path, T=6 y=6 collision.\n\nSo need to avoid.\n\nNow, I could stay at some y to avoid T=6.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=3, I go U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=4, safe.\n\nInstead of U, I could go S to stay at y=4 for T=5? Action at T=4 determines y_5.\n\nIf at T=4, I go S, then y_5 = y_4 =4.\n\nThen at T=5, I am on y=4.\n\ny=4 at T=5: τ=2, freeway 4: [-41+12, -30+12]? Speed 6, τ=2: [-41+6*2, -30+6*2] = [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, I can go U to y=5 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, y=5, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at T=5 I go U to y=6 at T=6, worse.\n\nOr if I go S at T=5, stay y=4 at T=6, then at T=6 y=4 safe, as above.\n\nBut I am stuck at y=4.\n\nThen later I need to go up.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at T=8 and T=9, so I need to be off y=4 by T=8.\n\nSimilarly, I can go down to y=1 which is always safe.\n\nBut y=1 is safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 unsafe at T=6, I should be on y<=4 or y=8 or y=9 at T=6.\n\ny=8 at T=6: is it safe? y=8 unsafe only at T=4, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, τ=3, freeway 8: first car [-23 +12*3, -12+12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], not 0.\n\nSecond car [25+36,36+36]=[61,72], not 0. Safe.\n\ny=9 at T=6, but I start from y=3, to y=9 in 3 steps? Impossible, min 6 steps to increase by 6.\n\nAt T=6, I can be at y=8 or y=4, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 before T=4 or after, but T=4 is unsafe for y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=4.\n\nSo at T=4, I should not be on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, should not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times.\n\nFor y=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe except T=8,9\n\ny=3: safe except T=8,9\n\ny=4: safe except T=8,9\n\ny=5: safe except T=6\n\ny=6: safe except T=6\n\ny=7: safe except T=6\n\ny=8: safe except T=4\n\nI start at T=3, y=3 safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some T.\n\nMin H=6, so end at T=9.\n\nBut at T=6, I need to avoid y=5,6,7.\n\nSo at T=6, I must be on y<=4 or y=8 or y=9.\n\ny=9 at T=6 is impossible from y=3 in 3 steps.\n\ny=8 at T=6: possible if I go up fast.\n\nFrom T=3 y=3, action U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, action U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, action U to y=6 at T=6, but at T=6 y=6 collision, not good.\n\nIf at T=4, action U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, instead of U, go D to y=4 at T=6? But at T=5 y=5 safe, then D to y=4, so at T=6 y=4 safe.\n\nBut y=4, and I need to go to y=9, still far.\n\nThen from y=4 at T=6, I can go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, y=5: is it safe? y=5 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and y=7 safe at T=7.\n\nThen U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=6: safe? y=6 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=8 safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7: safe? y=7 unsafe only at T=6, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=8: safe? y=8 unsafe only at T=4, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut this is slow, H=8 actions to reach T=11.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, I could go down to y=1 to avoid, but that might be worse.\n\nAnother path: at T=3 y=3, U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, since y=8 unsafe at T=4, but I'm on y=4, safe.\n\nNow, at T=4, I can go U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5 y=5 safe.\n\nNow, to avoid T=6 on y=5,6,7, at T=5, I can go S, stay at y=5 for T=6? But at T=6 y=5 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo D to y=4 at T=6, then at T=6 y=4 safe.\n\nBut then as before.\n\nOr, at T=5, go U to y=6 at T=6, collision.\n\nNot possible to be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSo the only safe at T=6 are y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9.\n\nBut y=0,1,2,3,4 are low, y=8,9 high.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=3, to be at y=8 at T=6, I need to increase by 5 in 3 steps, but each step +1 max, so in 3 steps from y=3, max y=6, cannot reach y=8.\n\nSimilarly, min y=0, but not useful.\n\nSo at T=6, I must be on y=4 or below, since y=8 impossible.\n\ny=4 at T=6 is possible.\n\nFor example, from start: T=3 y=3, U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, S to stay y=4 at T=5? Action at T=4, if S, y_5 = y_4 =4.\n\nThen at T=5, on y=4.\n\nThen at T=5, S again to stay y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen at T=6, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at T=8 and T=9, so I need to be off y=4 before T=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3.\n\nSo from T=6 y=4, I can go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7 y=5 safe (since unsafe only T=6).\n\nThen U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8 y=6: safe? y=6 unsafe only T=6, T=8 safe.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6, but y=6 is freeway, and at T=8, is it safe? Yes, as above.\n\nThen U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9 y=7: safe, similarly.\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=10.\n\nT=10 y=8 safe.\n\nU to y=9 at T=11.\n\nReached at T=11 with 8 actions.\n\nBut earlier at T=9, I am at y=7, but y=7 at T=9 is safe, but I can go directly to y=9 from y=7 in two steps, but at T=9 y=7, U to y=8 at T=10, then U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=4, instead of going up slowly, go faster.\n\nAt T=6 y=4, U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7 y=5 safe.\n\nU to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8 y=6 safe.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6 is safe, but if I go U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9 y=7 safe.\n\nU to y=8 at T=10.\n\nU to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=8, I can go directly to higher.\n\nBut y=7 at T=8 is also safe, but I am at y=6.\n\nFrom T=7 y=5, I can go U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, U to y=7 at T=9.\n\n etc.\n\nTo save time, at some point I can double up, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: avoid the unsafe times by being on safe lanes.\n\nFor example, at T=6, be on y=1 or y=2 or y=3, but y=2,3 are unsafe at T=8,9, but at T=6 they are safe.\n\ny=2 at T=6: safe? y=2 unsafe only at T=8,9, so at T=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3 safe at T=6.\n\nBut to be on y=2 or y=3 at T=6, I need to go down from y=3.\n\nFor example, at T=3 y=3, go D to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, on y=2.\n\ny=2 at T=4: τ=1, freeway 2: [-41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, go D to y=1 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, go S or U.\n\nBut at T=6, I can be on y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, and I have to avoid T=8,9 on y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe, so I need not to be on them at those turns.\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=1, I can go U to y=2 at T=7.\n\nT=7 y=2: safe, since unsafe only T=8,9.\n\nThen at T=7, U to y=3 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, y=3 unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf at T=7, I go U to y=2 at T=8? No.\n\nAt T=7, I am on y=2, action to go to y_8.\n\nIf I go U, to y=3 at T=8, but at T=8 on y=3 collision.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=2 at T=8, collision on y=2 at T=8.\n\nIf I go D to y=1 at T=8, then at T=8 on y=1, safe, since y=1 always safe.\n\nBut then at T=8, I am at y=1, far from 9.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut at T=9, y=2,3,4 unsafe, so I need to avoid them at T=9.\n\nThis might take more turns.\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nTo avoid T=8,9 on y=2,3,4, I need to be on y<=1 or y>=5 at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=5,6,7 are safe at T=8 and T=9, since unsafe only at T=6.\n\ny=8 safe at T=8,9.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\ny=1 safe.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, I should be on y=1, or y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8,9 are high, so better to be there.\n\nIn the first approach, when I was at T=6 y=4, I can go up quickly to be above by T=8.\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=4, U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7 y=5 safe.\n\nU to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8 y=6 safe.\n\nNow at T=8, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nBut at T=8, I need to go to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=8, U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9 y=7 safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=10.\n\nU to y=9 at T=11.\n\nReached at T=11.\n\nBut at T=9, I am at y=7, and T=9, but y=2,3,4 unsafe, but I'm on y=7 safe.\n\nCan I reach y=9 at T=9?\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=9, I need to have y_9 =9.\n\nFrom T=3 y=3, in 6 steps to T=9.\n\nBut at T=6, I need to be at some y, and not on y=5,6,7.\n\nBut as before, I can be on y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen from T=6 y=4, to T=9 y=9, I need +5 in 3 steps, impossible, max +3, so y=7 at best.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at T=9 from y=4 at T=6 in 3 steps.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=6 I am on y=3, even worse.\n\nSo the earliest possible is T=10 or T=11.\n\nT=10: to reach at T=10, H=7 actions from T=3 to T=9 actions, position at T=10.\n\nH actions from t=0 to H-1, position at t_1 + H.\n\nSo to reach at T, H = T - t_1.\n\nt_1=3, so to reach at T, H = T-3.\n\nMin T=9, H=6, but not possible due to collision.\n\nNext T=10, H=7.\n\nOr T=11, H=8.\n\nCan I reach at T=10 with H=7?\n\nThat means position at T=10 y=9.\n\nFrom start T=3 y=3, in 7 steps to T=10.\n\nAt T=6, I must not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nSo possible positions at T=6: y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9.\n\nBut y=8 or 9 at T=6 impossible from y=3 in 3 steps.\n\nSo must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8 and T=9, not on y=2,3,4 if possible, but I can be on safe y.\n\nFor example, at T=6 be on y=4.\n\nThen from T=6 to T=10, 4 steps, to increase from y=4 to y=9, need +5, but 4 steps max +4, so y=8 at best at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10 y=8, then I need another action to go to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo to reach y=9, earliest T=11.\n\nWith H=8 actions.\n\nActions from T=3 to T=10, position at T=11.\n\nLet's confirm.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at T=10, then U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut y=8 at T=10 is safe.\n\nCan I be at y=8 at T=10?\n\nFrom start, T=3 y=3.\n\nI need to avoid the problems.\n\nFor example, one way: at T=3 y=3, U to y=4 at T=4.  // action at T=3\n\nT=4 y=4, safe.\n\nAt T=4, since y=8 unsafe at T=4, but I'm on y=4.\n\nNow, to avoid T=6 on low y, but I need to be at T=6 on y<=4.\n\nAt T=4, I can go S to stay at y=4 for T=5.  // action S at T=4\n\nThen T=5 y=4, safe.\n\nAt T=5, go S to stay at y=4 for T=6.  // action S at T=5\n\nT=6 y=4, safe.\n\nNow at T=6, I am on y=4.\n\nThen I need to go up.\n\nAt T=6, action U to y=5 at T=7.  // action U at T=6\n\nT=7 y=5, safe (not T=6)\n\nAt T=7, action U to y=6 at T=8.  // U at T=7\n\nT=8 y=6, safe (not T=6)\n\nAt T=8, action U to y=7 at T=9.  // U at T=8\n\nT=9 y=7, safe (not T=6)\n\nAt T=9, action U to y=8 at T=10.  // U at T=9\n\nT=10 y=8, safe (y=8 unsafe only T=4)\n\nAt T=10, action U to y=9 at T=11.  // U at T=10\n\nNow at T=11 y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=3 to T=10, that's 8 actions: a3 to a10.\n\nt from 0 to 7? Absolute: actions at t_1=3 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=8, so actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nPositions: after actions, at T=4 to T=11.\n\nAt T=11 y=9.\n\nCollision checks at turns T when on freeway, from T=3 to T=10.\n\nT=3: y=3, safe\n\nT=4: y=4, safe\n\nT=5: y=4, safe\n\nT=6: y=4, safe\n\nT=7: y=5, safe\n\nT=8: y=6, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, safe\n\nT=10: y=8, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nEarlier I thought T=10 might be possible, but to reach at T=10, H=7, position at T=10 y=9.\n\nBut from T=3 y=3 to T=10 y=9 in 7 steps: need to increase by 6 in 7 steps, possible, but with the constraint at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, must be on y<=4.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=10, from y at T=6.\n\nT=6 to T=10 is 4 steps, to y=9, so y at T=6 must be y=9-4=5, since min steps.\n\ny at T=6, then after 4 actions, at T=10.\n\nIf I go U each time, y increases by 1 each step, so y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, so from y at T=6, after 4 U, y at T=10 = y_6 +4.\n\nSet y_10 =9, so y_6 +4 =9, so y_6=5.\n\nSimilarly, if I go faster, but max +1, so y_10 <= y_6 +4.\n\nTo have y_10=9, need y_6 >=5.\n\nBut if y_6=5, then y_10=9 with 4U.\n\nBut at T=6, y=5 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf y_6=6, y_10=10>9, but y max 9, so not possible, or if I go down, but y_10=9, so from y_6, must increase to 9, so y_6 <=5, since y_10 = y_6 +4 <=9, so y_6 <=5.\n\ny_10 = y_6 +4 if all U, so to have y_10=9, y_6=5.\n\nBut y_6=5 unsafe at T=6.\n\nIf I have some S or D, but S or D would make y_10 < y_6 +4, so to have y_10=9, must have y_6=5 and all U from T=6 to T=9.\n\nBut at T=6 y=5 collision.\n\nThus impossible to reach at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, if y_6=4, then with 4U, y_10=8, then need another step to y=9 at T=11.\n\nIf y_6=6, but y_6=6 unsafe, and y_10=10>9 invalid.\n\nSo indeed, cannot reach before T=11.\n\nThus minimal H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have 8 actions, reach at T=11.\n\nBut can I reach with H=7? We just saw no.\n\nPerhaps with different path.\n\nFor example, go to y=8 earlier.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, I cannot be on y=8.\n\nBut I can be on y=8 after T=4.\n\nFor example, from start: T=3 y=3, U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nT=4 y=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nT=5 y=5 safe.\n\nNow, to avoid T=6, at T=5, I cannot stay or go up to y=6, so I must go down to y=4 at T=6.\n\nAction D at T=5, to y=4 at T=6.\n\nT=6 y=4 safe.\n\nThen from T=6 y=4, same as before.\n\nI could go directly to higher from here.\n\nBut with the same steps.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, but going down and up takes more time.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, I stayed at y=4 for two extra turns.\n\nTo save one turn, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=7 before T=6 or after.\n\nBut at T=5, y=5, if I go U to y=6 at T=6, collision.\n\nUnless I can be on y=7 at T=6, but from y=3 at T=3, to y=7 at T=6, need +4 in 3 steps, impossible, max y=6.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps use the fact that at T=4, y=8 is unsafe, but I can be on y=8 at other times.\n\nBut to reach y=8 quickly.\n\nFor example, from T=3 y=3, U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nT=4 y=4, U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nT=5 y=5, U to y=6 at T=6, collision, not possible.\n\nIf at T=4, U to y=5 at T=5, then at T=5 D to y=4 at T=6, as before.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions: at T=3: U to y=4\n\nT=4: S to stay y=4? In my earlier: at T=4 action S, so y5=4\n\nThen T=5 action S, y6=4\n\nThen T=6 U, y7=5\n\nT=7 U, y8=6\n\nT=8 U, y9=7\n\nT=9 U, y10=8\n\nT=10 U, y11=9\n\nBut at T=9, I am at y=7, but I could go U at T=8 to y=7? Let's list positions:\n\nAfter action at T, position at T+1.\n\nTurn: position at turn T.\n\nT=3: y=3\n\nAction a3: let's say U, then y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4\n\nAction a4: S, then y5=4\n\nT=5: y=4? At T=5, position y=4\n\nAction a5: S, then y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4\n\nAction a6: U, then y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5\n\nAction a7: U, then y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6\n\nAction a8: U, then y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7\n\nAction a9: U, then y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8\n\nAction a10: U, then y11=9\n\nReached at T=11.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6, and I go U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7 is safe, but I could go to y=8 directly, but no, only one step.\n\nPerhaps from T=7 y=5, I can go U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8 y=6, U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=10, U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSame.\n\nTo reach faster, but cannot.\n\nAnother sequence: after T=6 y=4, instead of going up step by step, but I have to.\n\nSince at T=8 and T=9, I can be on higher y.\n\nBut in this path, at T=9 I am at y=7.\n\nIf I could be at y=8 at T=9, but from y=4 at T=6, to y=8 at T=9, in 3 steps: y6=4, after a6, y7; a7, y8; a8, y9.\n\nSo y9 = y6 + (delta y6 + delta y7 + delta y8)\n\nEach delta <=1, so y9 <= y6 +3 =4+3=7.\n\nSo at T=9, y<=7, cannot be y=8.\n\nThus at T=9, max y=7, then to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo no better.\n\nThus minimal H=8.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I used two S actions, but I could avoid staying if possible, but not necessary.\n\nI could go down to y=1 and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, to be on y=1 at T=6, then go up, but y=1 to y=9, 8 steps from T=6, reach at T=14, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nThus the sequence I have is fine.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=3.\n\nActions from a_{3} to a_{10}, for H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_3 = U  // to go to y=4\n\nBut at turn t_1=3, action a_3, which determines y_{4}.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt turn 3: action U\n\nThen at turn 4: action S\n\nTurn 5: action S\n\nTurn 6: action U\n\nTurn 7: action U\n\nTurn 8: action U\n\nTurn 9: action U\n\nTurn 10: action U\n\nThen position at turn 11: y=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, action U to go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=8 but without staying?\n\nFor example, at turn 3: U to y=4\n\nTurn 4: instead of S, go U to y=5 at turn 5.\n\nBut then at turn 5 y=5, I need to avoid turn 6.\n\nSo at turn 5, I can go D to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nThen turn 6 y=4.\n\nThen same as before: U to y=5 at turn 7, etc.\n\nBut now, from turn 4: if I go U to y=5 at turn 5.\n\nThen turn 5: action D to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nThen turn 6: action U to y=5 at turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: U to y=6 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: U to y=7 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: U to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: U to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nSame number of actions: actions at turn 3 to 10, 8 actions.\n\nBut in this case, I used a D action, which might be similar.\n\nIn terms of time, same.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I used S, here D.\n\nBut both work.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 10 if I am at y=8 at turn 9, but from above, I cannot.\n\nAnother thought: what if I go to y=8 at turn 5 or something.\n\nBut turn 4 y=8 unsafe.\n\nAt turn 3 y=3, U to y=4 at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 4, U to y=5 at turn 5.\n\nThen at turn 5, U to y=6 at turn 6, collision, not possible.\n\nSo I must avoid that.\n\nThus, minimal H=8.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, there are two cars, but only one causes issue.\n\nBut I think I covered.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to specify for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=3.\n\nSo actions from turn 3 to turn 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (or in the alternative, D, but S is fine)\n\nIn the first sequence, I had S at turn 4 and turn 5.\n\nTo make it without staying, but not necessary.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, but not helpful.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo let's write:\n\nTurn t_1: U  // a_{3} = U\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: S  // a_4 = S\n\nt_1 +1 is turn 4.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nBut in output, it should be absolute turns.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn positions: after a3 U, at T=4 y=4\n\na4 S, at T=5 y=4\n\na5 S, at T=6 y=4\n\na6 U, at T=7 y=5\n\na7 U, at T=8 y=6\n\na8 U, at T=9 y=7\n\na9 U, at T=10 y=8\n\na10 U, at T=11 y=9\n\nAll safe as before.\n\nWith the alternative: a3 U, a4 U, a5 D, a6 U, a7 U, a8 U, a9 U, a10 U\n\nThen positions: T=4 y=4 (after a3)\n\nT=5 y=5 (after a4 U)\n\na5 D, so y6=4 (at T=6)\n\nThen a6 U, y7=5 (T=7)\n\na7 U, y8=6 (T=8)\n\na8 U, y9=7 (T=9)\n\na9 U, y10=8 (T=10)\n\na10 U, y11=9 (T=11)\n\nSame, but here I used D at turn 5.\n\nBoth are valid, but the first one with S might be simpler.\n\nIn the first, I stayed at y=4 during the unsafe T=6 for y=5,6,7.\n\nNow, I think H=8 is correct.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach with H=7.\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, go U to y=5 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, I have to go down or stay, but if go down to y=4 at T=6, then at T=6 y=4.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at T=10, need y=5 at T=6 to have y=9 at T=10 with 4U, but y=5 at T=6 unsafe.\n\nIf y=4 at T=6, then with 4U, y=8 at T=10, not 9.\n\nThen need another step.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H=8.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nThe car state has freeway 8 with two cars, but we handled.\n\nIn freeway 5,6,7, the second car is safe, only first car causes issue at T=6.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nStarting from turn 3:\n\nAction at turn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be in a box.\n\nBut let me write the turns properly.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 +7, since t_1=3, H=8, so turns from t_1 to t_1+7, which is 3 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 9, I go U to y=8 at turn 10, then turn 10 U to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut collision only up to turn 10, and at turn 10 I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\ny=8 at turn 10: τ=7, freeway 8: first car [-23 +12*7, -12+12*7] = [-23+84, -12+84] = [61,72], not 0.\n\nSecond car [25+84,36+84]=[109,120], not 0. Safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I reach earlier, but I think not.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H = 8\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The actions are chosen to avoid the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1 is always safe.\n- Freeways 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeways 5, 6, and 7 are unsafe at turn 6.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turn 4.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 3 and ends at turn 10, with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 11. The actions ensure that the player is not on an unsafe freeway at the corresponding unsafe turn:\n\n- At turn 6, the player is on \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 is only unsafe at turns 8 and 9).\n- At turn 4, the player is not on \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 is unsafe, but player is on \\(y = 4\\)).\n- At turns 8 and 9, the player is on \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as freeways 5, 6, and 7 are only unsafe at turn 6).\n\nThe minimal \\(H = 8\\) is required because:\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 (requiring \\(H = 7\\)) is impossible, as it would require being at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6 (unsafe due to collision on freeway 5, 6, or 7).\n- With \\(H = 8\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 safely.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n- Turn 3: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 4)\n- Turn 4: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5)\n- Turn 5: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11)\n\nAll positions from turn 3 to turn 10 are safe, as verified against the car movements and collision conditions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10\\text{: } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=4, with head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left or right moving, but in the update, for right-moving, span goes from tail to head increasing, and for left-moving, head to tail decreasing? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving cars: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\" Since h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, head is probably the front, so if it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\" and since τ and h, with tail and head, for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so it shifts right.\n\nBut in the collision condition: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T. So at turn T, if the player is on freeway k, and there's a car on freeway k where 0 is in its span, then collision.\n\nAlso, note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action to go to y_{T+1}. But the collision is checked at each turn based on where you are at that turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked for cars on y_T at that turn. If you move to a different row, you only care about cars on that row when you are on it.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,4) at turn 4. We need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1=4.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (60,49, right, 3). Direction right, so at T=4, span is [τ, h] = [49,60]? Head and tail: it says (head, tail, direction, speed). So head is 60, tail is 49, direction right, speed 3.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the right end, tail left. So span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [49,60].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [49 + 3(T-4), 60 + 3(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (-24,-35, right, 6). Head -24, tail -35? That seems odd. -35 is less than -24, so if right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so if tail is -35, head is -24, that means the car is from x=-35 to x=-24, which is left to right, so moving right.\n\nAt T=4, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T, [ -35 + 6(T-4), -24 + 6(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-24,-35, right,6) same as above.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-24,-35, right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-24,-35, right,12) and (48,37, right,12)\n\nFirst car: head -24, tail -35, right, speed 12. Span at T=4: [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +12(T-4), -24 +12(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: head 48, tail 37, right, speed 12. Span at T=4: [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 +12(T-4), 48 +12(T-4)]\n\nBut head and tail: (48,37), so tail 37, head 48, so [37,48] yes.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (-24,-35, right,12) and (48,37, right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (0,-11, right,12) and (48,37, right,12)\n\nFirst car: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 12. So at T=4, span [tail, head] = [-11,0]\n\nSecond car: head 48, tail 37, right,12, span [37,48]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k, and for that k, there is a car where 0 is in its span at time T.\n\n0 is the x-position where player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, if at time T, 0 is between the tail and head of the car, inclusive, then collision if player is on that freeway.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, so once we reach y=9, we're safe.\n\nBut we start at y=4, and need to move up to y=9.\n\nWe can move up, down, or stay, but since we want to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, the freeways are y=1 to 8, so for y=4, we are on freeway 4 at turn 4.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=4.\n\nWe need to find actions from turn 4 onwards.\n\nLet me first find for each freeway, when a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each car, find the times T when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen, for each freeway k, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThen, the player must not be on that freeway at those times.\n\nSince the player moves step by step, we need to ensure that at each turn T, if player is on k, then k is not occupied at T.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the occupation times.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span at T: [49 + 3(T-4), 60 + 3(T-4)]\n\nSet 0 in [49 + 3(T-4), 60 + 3(T-4)]\n\nSo 49 + 3(T-4) ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 3(T-4)\n\nLet u = T-4, time offset.\n\nSo 49 + 3u ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 3u\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 3u ≤ 0 => 3u ≤ -49 => u ≤ -49/3 ≈ -16.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 60 + 3u => 3u ≥ -60 => u ≥ -20\n\nBut u = T-4, T is turn, integer.\n\nu ≥ -20 and u ≤ -16.333, so u = -20, -19, -18, -17\n\nSince u integer.\n\nu ≥ ceil(-20) = -20? u ≥ -20 and u ≤ -16.333, so u <= -17 since -16.333, u <= -17? u ≤ floor(-16.333) no.\n\n49 + 3u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 60 + 3u\n\nFrom 0 ≤ 60 + 3u => u >= -20\n\nFrom 49 + 3u <= 0 => u <= -49/3 = -16.333, so u <= -17 since u integer.\n\nu <= -16.333 means u <= -17? -16.333, integers less than or equal to -16.333 are -17, -18, ... so u <= -17.\n\nSimilarly, u >= -20.\n\nSo u from -20 to -17 inclusive.\n\nu = -20, -19, -18, -17\n\nNow T = 4 + u, so T = 4-20= -16, 4-19=-15, 4-18=-14, 4-17=-13\n\nBut turns are from 4 onwards, and these times are in the past, T negative, which doesn't affect us since we start at T=4. So for freeway 1, at x=0, it's occupied only in the past, not in present or future. So freeway 1 is always safe at x=0 for T>=4.\n\nLet me confirm: at u= -17, T=4-17=-13, span: 49 + 3*(-17) = 49 -51 = -2, and 60 + 3*(-17)=60-51=9, so [-2,9], 0 is in it.\n\nu=-18: 49 +3*(-18)=49-54=-5, 60-54=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nu=-19: 49-57=-8, 60-57=3, [-8,3], 0 in.\n\nu=-20: 49-60=-11, 60-60=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nu=-16: 49 +3*(-16)=49-48=1, 60-48=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nu=-21: 49-63=-14, 60-63=-3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, only occupied for u<=-17, T<= -13, so for T>=4, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (-24,-35, right,6)\n\nSpan at T: [-35 +6(T-4), -24 +6(T-4)]\n\nSet 0 in [ -35 +6u, -24 +6u ] where u=T-4\n\nSo -35 +6u <= 0 <= -24 +6u\n\nFirst: -35 +6u <=0 => 6u <=35 => u <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so u <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +6u => 6u >=24 => u >=4\n\nSo u >=4 and u <=5\n\nu integer, so u=4 or 5\n\nT=4+4=8 or 4+5=9\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, freeway 2 is occupied at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, (-24,-35,right,6), same as freeway 2? But freeway 3 has the same car description.\n\nIn the table, freeway 2 and 3 both have the same: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nBut they are different freeways, so each has its own car, but same parameters? No, it says \"Cars\" for each freeway, so freeway 2 has one car, freeway 3 has one car, both identical.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 also same.\n\nSo for freeway 3: same as above, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: [-35 +12u, -24 +12u] with u=T-4\n\n0 in [-35+12u, -24+12u]\n\n-35+12u <=0 <= -24+12u\n\nFirst: -35+12u <=0 => 12u <=35 => u <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, u<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12u => 12u >=24 => u>=2\n\nSo u>=2 and u<=2, so u=2\n\nT=4+2=6\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) head 48, tail 37, so span [37+12u, 48+12u]\n\n0 in [37+12u,48+12u]\n\n37+12u <=0 <=48+12u\n\nFirst: 37+12u <=0 => 12u <= -37 => u <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, u <= -4? u <= -3.083, so u <= -4 since integer? u <= floor(-3.083) = -4? -3.083, integers less than or equal: -4,-5,... but u <= -3.083 means u <= -4.\n\nu <= -37/12 = -3 1/12, so u <= -4? No.\n\n-37/12 = -3.083, so u <= -3.083, since u integer, u <= -4? For example u=-4: -4 <= -3.083 true? -4 is less than -3.083, yes. u=-3: -3 > -3.083? -3 = -3.000 > -3.083, so u=-3 is greater than -3.083, so not <=.\n\nu <= -3.083 means u must be less than or equal to -3.083, so for integers, u = -4, -5, ... because u=-4 = -4.0 <= -3.083 true, u=-3 = -3.0 > -3.083 false.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 48+12u => 12u >= -48 => u >= -4\n\nSo u >= -4 and u <= -3.083? From above:\n\nFirst inequality: 37+12u <=0 => u <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so u <= -4 since u integer? u <= -4.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 48+12u => 12u >= -48 => u >= -4\n\nSo u >= -4 and u <= -4, so u= -4\n\nThen T=4 + (-4) =0\n\nNow, u= -4, T=0, which is in the past, not relevant for T>=4.\n\nSimilarly, for u=-3: 37+12*(-3)=37-36=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only at u=-4, T=0.\n\nBut T=0 is past, so for the second car on freeway 5, it was at x=0 only at T=0, not after.\n\nNow for the first car on freeway 5, we have at u=2, T=6.\n\nSo overall for freeway 5, at T=6, the first car is at x=0, and second car not, so occupied at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars identical, so also occupied at T=6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, occupied at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) head 0, tail -11, right, speed 12.\n\nAt T=4, span [tail, head] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 +12u, 0 +12u ] = [-11+12u, 12u]\n\nNow, 0 in [-11+12u, 12u]\n\nSince it's a closed interval, 0 is in it if -11+12u <= 0 <= 12u\n\nNow, 0 <= 12u is always true for u>=0, since u=T-4, T>=4, u>=0.\n\n-11+12u <=0 => 12u <=11 => u <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so u <=0 since u integer? u <= 0.916, u integer, so u=0\n\nBecause u>=0, so u=0\n\nThen T=4+0=4\n\nAt u=0, span [-11,0], 0 is included, so yes.\n\nu=1: -11+12=1, 12*1=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at u=0, T=4.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), same as before, span [37+12u,48+12u], 0 in it only at u=-4, T=0, not for T>=4.\n\nSo for freeway 8, first car at T=4, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, so at T=4, freeway 8 is occupied at x=0.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0 for T>=4:\n\nFreeway 1: never (for T>=4)\n\nFreeway 2: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: T=6\n\nFreeway 6: T=6\n\nFreeway 7: T=6\n\nFreeway 8: T=4\n\nAlso, at T=4, freeway 8 occupied.\n\nPlayer starts at T=4, y=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=4, freeway 4 is not occupied? Freeway 4 occupied at T=8,9, not at T=4.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=8,9.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 4: from above, for freeway 4, same as 2 and 3, occupied only at T=8,9.\n\nAt T=4, u=0, span [-35+0, -24+0] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 is occupied at T=4.\n\nPlayer is at y=4 at T=4, not on freeway 8, so no collision.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: from y=4, we can go up to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on certain freeways at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, freeways 5,6,7 are occupied at T=6.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4 occupied at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=4.\n\nSince we start at T=4, y=4.\n\nWe can move up immediately.\n\nBut let's see the constraints.\n\nThe player can move U, D, S each turn.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we should go up as fast as possible, but may need to delay or stay to avoid collisions.\n\nPossible paths: from y=4, we need to reach y=9, which is 5 steps up, but we can move multiple U, but since we move one per turn, minimum 5 turns if no delays.\n\nBut we may need to stay or go down to avoid being on a bad freeway at bad time.\n\nNow, the dangerous times: T=6 for y=5,6,7; T=8 and 9 for y=2,3,4.\n\ny=1 is always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, which is occupied only at T=4, but since we are not there at T=4, and for T>4, it might be safe? Freeway 8: at T=4 occupied, but for T>4?\n\nFrom above, freeway 8: first car, at u=0,T=4: [-11,0], occupied.\n\nu=1,T=5: [-11+12,0+12]=[1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nu=2,T=6: [-11+24,24]=[13,24], safe, etc. So freeway 8 safe for T>=5.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nNow, list the occupation:\n\n- Freeway 1: safe all times\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied T=6\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied T=6\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied T=6\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied T=4, safe T>=5\n\nWe start at T=4, y=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=4: freeway 4 is safe at T=4, since occupied only at T=8,9.\n\nWe can stay or move.\n\nTo go up, we need to go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 are dangerous at T=6.\n\ny=2,3,4 dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nBut since we start at y=4 and go up, we may not need to go down, so y=2,3 might not be visited if we go straight up.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 is safe.\n\nNow, the critical point is T=6.\n\nAt T=6, if player is on y=5,6, or 7, collision.\n\nBecause freeways 5,6,7 occupied at T=6.\n\nSo we must not be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8 and 9, must not be on y=2,3,4, but since we are going up, we might be above by then.\n\nNow, T=6 is a problem.\n\nWe start at T=4, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nAt T=4, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at T=5? Let's think in terms of turns.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nAfter action, we move to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T=4, we are at y=4.\n\nWe choose action a_4, which determines y_5.\n\nThen at T=5, we are at y_5, and so on.\n\nWe need to avoid being at y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nT=6 is a specific turn.\n\nAt T=6, player must not be on freeway 5,6, or 7, so y_T !=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nStart: T=4, y=4.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, from T=4 to T=5: y=5, T=6: y=6, T=7: y=7, T=8: y=8, T=9: y=9.\n\nBut at T=6, y=6, which is freeway 6, occupied at T=6, collision. Not good.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up at T=4 to y=5, then T=5 y=5, T=6 y=6, same problem.\n\nAt T=4, we could stay: S, so y=4 at T=5? Action at T=4 determines y_5.\n\nIf a_4 = S, then y_5 = y_4 + 0 = 4, so at T=5, y=4.\n\nThen at T=5, we can go up to y=5 at T=6, but at T=6, if y=5, on freeway 5, occupied, collision.\n\nIf at T=5 we stay, y=4 at T=6, but at T=6, y=4, freeway 4 is not occupied at T=6? Freeway 4 occupied only at T=8,9, so at T=6, freeway 4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,2, etc.\n\nBut if we stay at y=4, we are not moving up.\n\nLet's list possible y at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, we must not be at y=5,6,7.\n\nSo y_6 can be 0,1,2,3,4,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 to 4 or 8,9.\n\ny=9 is the target, but we may not be there yet.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and T=6 is two turns later, we can be at y=4, or y=3,2,1,0 if we go down, or y=5,6 if we go up, but y=5,6,7 forbidden at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: if we go up twice, from y=4 to y=5 at T=5, then to y=6 at T=6, or if we go up once and stay, etc.\n\nPossible y at T=6:\n\n- If we do nothing: S,S: y_6=4\n\n- U,S: from y=4, U to y=5 at T=5, then S, y_6=5\n\n- S,U: y=4 at T=5, then U to y=5 at T=6\n\n- U,U: to y=5 at T=5, then to y=6 at T=6\n\n- D,S: to y=3 at T=5, then S to y=3 at T=6\n\n- S,D: to y=4 at T=5, then D to y=3 at T=6\n\n- etc.\n\nBut at T=6, y cannot be 5,6,7.\n\nSo possible: y_6=4 (by S,S or D,S but D,S: from y=4 D to y=3 at T=5, then S to y=3 at T=6, so y=3)\n\ny_6=4: by doing S at both turns? From T=4 to T=5: if a_4=S, y_5=4\n\nThen at T=5 to T=6: if a_5=S, y_6=4\n\nSimilarly, if a_4=D, y_5=3, then a_5=S, y_6=3\n\nOr a_4=S, y_5=4, a_5=D, y_6=3\n\nOr a_4=U, y_5=5, but if y_5=5, at T=5, is it safe? We need to check each position.\n\nFirst, at T=4, y=4, freeway 4 safe, as not occupied.\n\nNow, if we go up at T=4, a_4=U, then y_5 = y_4 +1 =5\n\nAt T=5, y=5, freeway 5: is it occupied at T=5?\n\nFreeway 5: occupied only at T=6, not at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, u=1, for first car: [-35+12(1), -24+12(1)] = [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 and 7 same, occupied only at T=6.\n\nSo at T=5, y=5 is safe.\n\nBut if we are at y=5 at T=5, and we do something.\n\nBut at T=6, if we are on y=5,6,7, collision.\n\nSo from y=5 at T=5, if we go up, to y=6 at T=6, collision.\n\nIf we stay, y=5 at T=6, collision.\n\nIf we go down, to y=4 at T=6.\n\ny=4 at T=6 is safe, as freeway 4 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=6, we need to be at y<=4 or y>=8 at T=6.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, at T=6, u=2, span [13,24], safe, as we saw.\n\ny=9 no freeway.\n\nNow, from start, at T=4, y=4.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at T=5, then from there, to avoid y=5 at T=6, we must go down to y=4 at T=6, or stay but stay at y=5 bad, so must go down.\n\nThen we are back to y=4 at T=6.\n\nWe wasted two turns: from y=4 to y=5 to y=4, no progress.\n\nIf at T=4 we stay, y=4 at T=5, then at T=5 we can go up to y=5 at T=6, but y=5 at T=6 collision, so not good.\n\nIf at T=5 we stay, y=4 at T=6, safe, but we are still at y=4.\n\nThen from there we can go up.\n\nBut we have delay.\n\nWe could go down to lower y, but that might take more turns to go up later.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we could go to y=1, but that might be inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: be at y=8 or 9 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=4, y=4, to y=8 in two turns: need to go up 4 steps, but we can only move one per turn, so impossible. Max we can be at y=6 at T=6 if we go up both turns, but y=6 is bad.\n\nSo at T=6, we must be at y<=4 or y=8 or 9, but y=8 or 9 not reachable from y=4 in two turns. From T=4 to T=6, two actions: we can go to y=4,5,6 or 3,4,5 or etc., but min y=2 or max y=6.\n\nFrom y=4, after two actions: possible y_6: 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nCannot reach y=7,8,9 in two actions.\n\ny=6 is possible but bad.\n\nSo at T=6, we can only be at y=2,3,4.\n\ny=2,3,4 at T=6.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 are freeways 2,3,4, which are occupied at T=8 and 9, but not at T=6, so at T=6 they are safe.\n\nFor example, freeway 4 at T=6: u=2, span [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo at T=6, y=2,3,4 are safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nAfter T=6, we can go up.\n\nBut we also have to avoid T=8 and 9 for y=2,3,4.\n\nFirst, let's get past T=6 safely.\n\nSo at T=6, we must be at y=2,3, or 4.\n\nSince we start at y=4, easiest is to be at y=4 at T=6.\n\nHow? For example:\n\nOption 1: at T=4, S (stay), so y_5=4\n\nThen at T=5, S (stay), so y_6=4\n\nSafe at T=6.\n\nWe used two turns to stay at y=4.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, which is 5 steps up.\n\nFrom T=6, y=4, we can go U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 at T=11? Let's see.\n\nAt T=6, y=4\n\nT=7: U, y=5\n\nT=8: U, y=6\n\nBut at T=8, y=6, freeway 6: is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 6 occupied at T=6, but at T=8, u=4, for first car: [-35+12*4, -24+12*4]= [-35+48, -24+48]= [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], not. So safe.\n\nBut the problem is at T=8 and T=9, freeways 2,3,4 are occupied, but y=6 is freeway 6, not 2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, occupied only at T=6, not at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, if we are on y=6, it should be safe.\n\nBut at T=8, freeways 2,3,4 are occupied, but we are on y=6, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, if we are on y=7 or something.\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=6: y=4\n\nT=7: U, y=5\n\nT=8: U, y=6\n\nT=9: U, y=7\n\nT=10: U, y=8\n\nT=11: U, y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=6: y=4, freeway 4, u=2, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5, u=3, first car [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in; second car [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], not; safe.\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6, u=4, first car [13,24]? Earlier: [-35+48=13, -24+48=24], yes [13,24]; second car [37+48=85,48+48=96], 0 not in; safe.\n\nAlso, freeways 2,3,4 occupied at T=8, but we are on y=6, not affected.\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7, u=5, first car [-35+60=25, -24+60=36], [25,36]; second car [37+60=97,48+60=108], 0 not in; safe.\n\nBut at T=9, freeways 2,3,4 occupied, but we are on y=7.\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8, u=6, span first car [-11+72, 0+72]=[61,72], second car [37+72=109,48+72=120], both far, 0 not in; safe.\n\nT=11: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo this works, but it takes until T=11 to reach y=9, with H=7 turns? From T=4 to T=11, that's 7 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nWe start at T=4.\n\nAfter first action, at T=5, and so on, until we reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this sequence: actions from t_1=4 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nStart: T=4, position before action? No, at turn T, we are at position, then we choose action.\n\nAfter H turns, we have performed H actions, and at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9? Let's see the index.\n\nThe player position at turn t is (0, y_t)\n\nWe choose actions for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, we move to position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen position at t_1 + H is the result.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above: at T=4, we have y=4.\n\nThen we did: T=4: S, so y_5=4\n\nT=5: S, y_6=4\n\nT=6: U, y_7=5\n\nT=7: U, y_8=6\n\nT=8: U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: U, y_11=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nWe used actions from T=4 to T=10, that's 7 actions: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nWe could be at a lower y at T=6 to save time or something.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, we could go to y=1 quickly and then up, but that might not help.\n\nAt T=4, instead of staying, we could go down to y=3 at T=5, then at T=5 to T=6, we can stay or go down or up.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: to avoid the T=6 problem, we can be at y=4 at T=6, but we can reach it with only one stay.\n\nFor example: at T=4, S, y_5=4\n\nThen at T=5, we can go down to y=3 at T=6? y=3 at T=6 is safe, but then we are lower, need to go up more.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt T=4, go down to y=3 at T=5, then at T=5, go down to y=2 at T=6, y=2 safe at T=6.\n\nBut then from y=2, need to go to y=9, 7 steps, even worse.\n\nSo staying at y=4 for T=6 is better.\n\nBut we used two actions to stay: S at T=4 and S at T=5, to have y_6=4.\n\nBut at T=4, we could do nothing, or we could move, but to avoid being at bad position at T=6.\n\nSince at T=5, y=5 is safe, we could be at y=5 at T=5, then at T=5, instead of staying, go down to y=4 at T=6.\n\nSo sequence: T=4: U, to y_5=5\n\nT=5: D, to y_6=4\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, from here, same as before: T=6: U, y_7=5\n\nT=7: U, y_8=6\n\nBut at T=8, y=6, safe as before.\n\nThen continue to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut we have same number of actions: actions at T=4:U, T=5:D, T=6:U, ..., up to T=10:U, y_11=9, still 7 actions.\n\nT=4 to T=10, 7 actions.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had two S, here we have U and D, which also no progress.\n\nNow, to reach faster, we need to be at higher y when we go up after T=6.\n\nBut at T=6 we are at y=4.\n\nWe could be at y=3 or 4, but not higher.\n\nAnother thought: after T=6, we need to avoid T=8 and 9 for y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, if we are on y=2,3,4, collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nIn the previous path, at T=8 we are at y=6, not 2,3,4, safe.\n\nSimilarly T=9 at y=7, safe.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, from start, if we can be at y=4 at T=6, but with less delay.\n\nBut we have to spend at least one turn not going up to avoid being at y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSince from T=4 to T=6, two turns, to go from y=4 to y=4, we need at least one S or D, so we lose one net upward move.\n\nMinimum, we have to have a delay of one turn compared to direct up.\n\nDirect up: T=4:U, y=5; T=5:U, y=6; but at T=6 y=6 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWith one delay: for example, T=4:U, to y=5 at T=5; then T=5:D, to y=4 at T=6; then from y=4 at T=6, go up to y=5 at T=7, etc., to y=9 at T=11.\n\nT=4:U, y5=5\n\nT=5:D, y6=4\n\nT=6:U, y7=5\n\nT=7:U, y8=6\n\nT=8:U, y9=7\n\nT=9:U, y10=8\n\nT=10:U, y11=9\n\nStill T=11.\n\nT=4:S, y5=4\n\nT=5:U, but if T=5 U to y=5 at T=6, collision, not good.\n\nT=4:S, y5=4\n\nT=5:S, y6=4\n\nThen T=6:U, y7=5\n\n...\n\nSame as first.\n\nT=4:D, to y=3 at T=5\n\nT=5:U, to y=4 at T=6? y=4 at T=6 safe.\n\nThen T=6:U, y7=5\n\nT=7:U, y8=6\n\n...\n\nStill y11=9.\n\nBut now we started lower, but same end point.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster after T=6.\n\nBut from y=4 at T=6, to y=9, it takes 5 up moves, at T=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nSo y at T=11.\n\nUnless we can be at higher than y=4 at T=6, but we cannot because of T=6 constraint.\n\ny=8 or 9 at T=6 impossible.\n\nSo minimum, we need to reach y=9 at T=11 or later.\n\nBut T=11 is turn 11, from start turn 4, so 7 actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by T=10.\n\nIf we can be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nThen y_10=9.\n\nThat means at T=9, we must be at y=8 or 9, and if y=8, go U, or if y=9, stay, but stay at y=9 is fine, but we need to reach it.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=10, we need to be at y=8 or 9 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y=7,8,9 or less.\n\nBut at T=6, we are at y<=4.\n\nFrom T=6 to T=10, 4 turns, from y=4 to y=9, need 5 steps, impossible in 4 turns, since each turn move at most +1.\n\ny=4 at T=6, after 4 actions to T=10, y can be from y=0 to y=8, max y=8 at T=10 if we go up all four times.\n\ny_6=4\n\nT=7: U, y7=5\n\nT=8: U, y8=6\n\nT=9: U, y9=7\n\nT=10: U, y10=8\n\nThen at T=10, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=10, we need y_10=9, so must be at y=8 or 9 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=8 or 9.\n\nBut at T=6, y=4, to T=9, 3 turns, from y=4 to y=8 or 9: max y=7 at T=9 if U,U,U: y7=5, y8=6, y9=7.\n\nThen at T=10, U to y=8, still not 9.\n\ny=8 at T=10.\n\nTo have y=9 at T=10, need to be at y=8 at T=9, then U to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=9, y=8, which is possible only if at T=8, y=7 or 8, and so on.\n\nAt T=6, y=4, then:\n\nT=7: U, y7=5\n\nT=8: U, y8=6\n\nT=9: U, y9=7\n\nT=10: U, y10=8\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can't, max one per turn.\n\nSo from y=4 at T=6, earliest to reach y=9 is at T=11, with y11=9 after 5 up moves.\n\nSimilarly, if we were at y=3 at T=6, it would be later.\n\nSo minimum H=7 actions to reach at T=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nWith H=7, actions at t=4 to t=10.\n\nBut in the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nBut we can have different sequences.\n\nFor example, one way: to avoid using D, we can use S.\n\nBut in the U and D way, we have an extra move but same time.\n\nNow, we also have to consider the T=8 and 9, but in the path above, we are not on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or 9, so fine.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go to y=1 or something.\n\nSuppose at T=4, we go down to y=3 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, we can go down to y=2 at T=6, or stay at y=3, or up to y=4.\n\nAt T=6, we need to be at y<=4, so y=2,3,4 all ok.\n\nSay y=3 at T=6.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut y=3 at T=6, then T=7:U to y=4, T=8:U to y=5, but at T=8, y=5, freeway 5: u=4, T=8, u=T-4=4, freeway 5: first car [-35+48=13, -24+48=24], [13,24], 0 not in; second car [85,96], safe.\n\nThen T=9:U to y=6, T=10:U to y=7, T=11:U to y=8, T=12:U to y=9. Even later, T=12.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf at T=5, from y=3, go up to y=4 at T=6, same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nAfter T=6, we can go directly up.\n\nBut we have the issue of T=8 and 9 for y=2,3,4.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=5,6,7 at T=8,9, which are safe.\n\nBut suppose we are on y=4 at T=7 or something.\n\nIn the sequence, we are fine.\n\nTo save one turn, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 8 is safe after T=4, and y=8 is close to 9, we can go to y=8 quickly.\n\nBut to reach y=8, from y=4, need 4 up moves.\n\nAt T=4, y=4.\n\nIf we go U,U,U,U, to y=8 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=6, we would be at y=6, which is bad.\n\nCannot.\n\nWith delay: for example, T=4:U to y=5 at T=5\n\nT=5:D to y=4 at T=6\n\nThen T=6:U to y=5 at T=7\n\nT=7:U to y=6 at T=8\n\nT=8:U to y=7 at T=9\n\nT=9:U to y=8 at T=10\n\nT=10:U to y=9 at T=11\n\nSame as before.\n\nT=4:S to y=4 at T=5? Then T=5:U to y=5 at T=6, collision, not possible.\n\nUnless we go to y=8 at different time.\n\nBut we have to avoid T=6 for y=5,6,7.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 later.\n\nBut I think 7 turns is minimum.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions again.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=4 occupied, but we are not there.\n\nAnother thing: at T=4, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nNow, we could go to y=8 directly if possible, but not because of T=6.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=4 until after T=6, but we did.\n\nOr, since y=1 is safe, we can go down to y=1, but that takes more turns.\n\nFor example, T=4:D to y=3 at T=5\n\nT=5:D to y=2 at T=6\n\nThen at T=6, y=2, safe.\n\nThen T=6:U to y=3 at T=7\n\nBut at T=7, y=3, freeway 3: occupied? Freeway 3 occupied at T=8,9, not at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, u=3, freeway 3: car [-35+18, -24+18]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen T=7:U to y=3? T=6:U from y=2 to y=3 at T=7\n\nThen T=7:U to y=4 at T=8\n\nBut at T=8, y=4, freeway 4 occupied! At T=8, u=4, span [-35+24? u=4, T-4=4, -35 +6*4= -35+24= -11, -24+24=0? Freeway 4 car: (-24,-35,right,6), span at T: [-35 +6u, -24 +6u]\n\nAt u=4, [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included, so at T=8, freeway 4 occupied, collision if on y=4.\n\nIn this case, at T=8, y=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom T=6 y=2, we need to go up but avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=6, y=2.\n\nWe need to be above y=4 by T=8.\n\nT=8 is two turns later.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=6, to T=7: can go to y=1,2,3\n\nT=8: from there to y=0,1,2,3,4\n\nBut we need to be at y>4 at T=8, so y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y<=3 at T=7, max y=4 at T=8, which is bad if on y=4.\n\nIf at T=7 we are at y=3, T=8 y=4, collision.\n\nIf at T=7 y=2, T=8 y=3, at T=8 y=3, freeway 3 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if y=1 at T=7, T=8 y=2, freeway 2 occupied, collision.\n\nSo if at T=6 we are at y=2, at T=8 we must be at y<=4 or y>=5, but y<=4 is bad at T=8, and we cannot reach y>=5 from y=2 in two moves. Min y=0, max y=4.\n\ny=4 at T=8 is bad.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=2 at T=6 and avoid collision later.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=6 y=3, same issue.\n\nFor example, y=3 at T=6.\n\nT=7: can go to y=2,3,4\n\nT=8: from y=2 to y=1,2,3; y=3 to y=2,3,4; y=4 to y=3,4,5\n\nBut at T=8, y=2,3,4 all occupied, so must not be on them, so only possible if y=5 at T=8, but from above, if at T=7 y=4, then U to y=5 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=7, if y=4, is it safe? At T=7, freeway 4: u=3, span [-35+18, -24+18]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=7, y=4, then T=8: U to y=5, now at T=8, y=5, freeway 5: u=4, [13,24], safe, not occupied.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nBut at T=6, y=3, we can do:\n\nT=6: U to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: U to y=5 at T=8\n\nThen T=8: U to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: U to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10: U to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11: U to y=9 at T=12\n\nReach at T=12, later than before.\n\nFrom T=7 y=4, T=8 U to y=5, etc., but y=9 at T=12.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the best is to be at y=4 at T=6, and then go up directly to y=9 at T=11.\n\nWith 7 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8 at T=4, but we don't care.\n\nNow, another thing: in the beginning, at T=4, we can go up to y=5 at T=5, which is safe, then down to y=4 at T=6, safe, then up.\n\nOr we can stay at T=4 and T=5 to be at y=4 at T=6.\n\nEither way.\n\nBut going up and down might be considered less efficient, but same number of actions.\n\nWe can use stay.\n\nNow, to minimize H, which is the number of actions, both ways H=7.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach in fewer actions by going to a different path.\n\nSuppose we go to y=8 quickly after T=6.\n\nBut from y=4 at T=6, we need 4 moves to y=8 at T=10, then to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSame.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 at some point, but at T=6 we can't.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 1 is always safe, we can go down to y=1 and then up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, T=4:D to y=3\n\nT=5:D to y=2\n\nT=6:D to y=1? But at T=6 y=1 is safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 in 8 moves, much worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimum.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from turn t_1=4.\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nTo avoid down move, we can use stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 4: S  (so y_5=4)\n\nTurn 5: S  (y_6=4)\n\nTurn 6: U  (y_7=5)\n\nTurn 7: U  (y_8=6)\n\nTurn 8: U  (y_9=7)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y_10=8)\n\nTurn 10: U  (y_11=9)\n\nSo after action at turn 10, y_11=9, so H=7 actions.\n\nActions at turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nWe can have:\n\nTurn 4: U  (y_5=5)\n\nTurn 5: D  (y_6=4)\n\nTurn 6: U  (y_7=5)\n\nTurn 7: U  (y_8=6)\n\nTurn 8: U  (y_9=7)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y_10=8)\n\nTurn 10: U  (y_11=9)\n\nSame H=7.\n\nIn the second one, at turn 5, we go down, which might not be necessary, but it works.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up later.\n\nBut no.\n\nNow, in the first sequence with two stays, we have y=4 at T=5 and T=6.\n\nAt T=5, y=4, is it safe? Freeway 4 at T=5, u=1, span [-35+6, -24+6]=[-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, but in the output, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach in H=6.\n\nSuppose H=6 actions, then at turn t_1 + H = 4+6=10, y_10=9.\n\nThen y_10=9.\n\nThat means at turn 9, y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 8, y_8 must be 7,8,9 or less.\n\nBut at turn 6, we must have y_6 <=4 or y_6>=8, but y_6>=8 impossible from start.\n\ny_6 <=4.\n\nThen from y_6 <=4 at T=6, to y_9 at T=9.\n\nAfter 3 actions, from y<=4 to y_9.\n\nMax y_9 = y_6 +3 <=4+3=7.\n\nSo y_9 <=7.\n\nThen to have y_10=9, we need y_9=8 or 9, but y_9<=7, contradiction.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at T=10.\n\nTherefore, minimum H=7, reaching at T=11.\n\nSo we need 7 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose one.\n\nIn the first sequence, we have two S at the beginning.\n\nWe could have the down move.\n\nBut perhaps we can have a sequence where we go up immediately but avoid the collision.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we go to y=8 directly when safe.\n\nBut after T=6.\n\nFor example, from T=4: S, y=4\n\nT=5: U, but if U to y=5 at T=6, collision, not possible.\n\nT=4: U to y=5 at T=5\n\nT=5: S, but at T=6 y=5, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo must have y=4 at T=6.\n\nThus, we need to have action at T=4 such that we don't go to y=5 at T=5 if we are going to be stuck, but we have to set y_6=4.\n\nSo either S at T=4 and S at T=5, or U at T=4 and D at T=5, or D at T=4 and U at T=5 to y=4 at T=6, etc.\n\nAll require two actions to have no net move or down.\n\nSo the sequence with two S is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5,6,7 have two cars, but we considered.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=4 occupied, but we don't go there early.\n\nIn our sequence, we go to y=8 at T=10 or 11, safe.\n\nNow, I think it's ok.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nSequence: for example,\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn this, after turn 10 action, y_11=9.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=10.\n\nTo write in the format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 6 to 10 are U, but at turn 6 U, to y=5 at T=7, etc.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nWe can have a different sequence, but this works.\n\nTo avoid multiple U at the end, but it's fine.\n\nAnother sequence: Turn 4: U (to y=5 at T=5)\n\nTurn 5: D (to y=4 at T=6)\n\nTurn 6: U (to y=5 at T=7)\n\nTurn 7: U (to y=6 at T=8)\n\nTurn 8: U (to y=7 at T=9)\n\nTurn 9: U (to y=8 at T=10)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=9 at T=11)\n\nSame.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nNow, in the first one, we have S at the beginning, which might be simpler.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 8 has a car at (0,-11,right,12) at T=4, so at T=4, x=0 is occupied, but we are not on y=8.\n\nNow, I think that's all.\n\nSo the minimal number is H=7.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt_1=4, current turn.\n\nPlayer position at turn 4: (0,4)\n\nAfter action a_4, position at turn 5, and so on.\n\nWith actions above, we reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAnswer format should be the actions from turn 4 to turn 10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSo I'll go with the first sequence.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and a car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)\n- **Freeway 1**: Safe for all \\(T \\geq 4\\) (occupancy only at past turns).\n- **Freeway 2**: Occupied at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 3**: Occupied at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Occupied at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Occupied at \\(T = 6\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Occupied at \\(T = 6\\).\n- **Freeway 7**: Occupied at \\(T = 6\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Occupied at \\(T = 4\\), safe for \\(T \\geq 5\\).\n\n### Key Constraints\n- At \\(T = 6\\), the player must not be on freeways 5, 6, or 7 (i.e., \\(y_6 \\neq 5, 6, 7\\)).\n- At \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\), the player must not be on freeways 2, 3, or 4 (i.e., \\(y_8 \\neq 2, 3, 4\\) and \\(y_9 \\neq 2, 3, 4\\)).\n- Starting at \\(y_4 = 4\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires a minimum of 5 upward moves (each increasing \\(y\\) by 1), but delays are needed to avoid collisions.\n\n### Strategy\n- **Avoid \\(T = 6\\) collision**: The player must be at \\(y_6 \\leq 4\\) (since \\(y_6 \\geq 8\\) is impossible from \\(y_4 = 4\\) in two moves). The safest and most efficient is to stay at \\(y = 4\\) for turns 5 and 6 using \"S\" actions.\n- **Path after \\(T = 6\\)**: From \\(y_6 = 4\\), move up (\"U\") each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11. This path avoids the \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\) constraints because:\n  - At \\(T = 8\\), \\(y_8 = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe as occupancy is only at \\(T = 6\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 9\\), \\(y_9 = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe as occupancy is only at \\(T = 6\\)).\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- **Turn 4 (\\(t_1\\))**: Action \"S\" – Player stays at \\(y_5 = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe at \\(T = 5\\)).\n- **Turn 5**: Action \"S\" – Player stays at \\(y_6 = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe at \\(T = 6\\), avoiding freeways 5-7).\n- **Turn 6**: Action \"U\" – Player moves to \\(y_7 = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe at \\(T = 7\\)).\n- **Turn 7**: Action \"U\" – Player moves to \\(y_8 = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 8\\), avoiding freeways 2-4).\n- **Turn 8**: Action \"U\" – Player moves to \\(y_9 = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at \\(T = 9\\), avoiding freeways 2-4).\n- **Turn 9**: Action \"U\" – Player moves to \\(y_{10} = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at \\(T = 10\\)).\n- **Turn 10**: Action \"U\" – Player reaches \\(y_{11} = 9\\) (no freeway, safe).\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 7\\) actions (turns 4 to 10) and reaches the goal at turn 11. It is minimal because:\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 (\\(H = 6\\)) is impossible: at turn 6, \\(y_6 \\leq 4\\), so by turn 9, \\(y_9 \\leq 7\\), and \\(y_{10} \\leq 8 < 9\\).\n- Any deviation (e.g., moving down) increases \\(H\\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 7\\) with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=4 and want to get to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and for that freeway, the car's span at that turn includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are considered to be on y_T at turn T, and then they move to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on row y_T. Therefore, we only worry about the car on row y_T at turn T.\n\nCar update: \n  - Right-moving: [tau, h] at t1, then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  - Left-moving: [h, tau] at t1, then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given cars are all right-moving? Actually, the direction is given: all are \"right\" in the table.\n\nLet me list the cars at t1=5:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> but note: for right-moving, the head is the front? Actually, the table says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right-moving, the car moves to the right. So at t1, the car is from -59 to -48? But the representation says: for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] meaning the tail is at the left and head at the right? Actually, the update rule for right-moving is: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the initial span is [tau, h] which is from tau to h, and since it's right-moving, h > tau.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n  Freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> so h=-48, tau=-59. Then the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]. Then at time T, it becomes [-59 + 3*(T-5), -48 + 3*(T-5)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe are only concerned when the car's span at turn T includes 0. So we need to check for each freeway we are on at turn T, if any car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nNote: For freeway 5,6,7,8, there are two cars. So we must check both.\n\nOur plan: We are at y=4 at turn 5. We want to go to y=9. We can move up (increasing y) or down (decreasing) or stay.\n\nWe need to avoid freeways 1 to 8 at the turn when we are on them. We start at y=4 (which is freeway 4? Actually, freeways are y=1,2,...,8. So y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nWe are at turn 5, on y=4.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway at a turn when a car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nLet's compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe'll denote T as the turn number (global turn, starting from t1=5).\n\nFor each freeway k, we have one or two cars. We'll write the span at turn T (T>=5) for each car.\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car1: initial at T=5: h=-48, tau=-59, s=3, right.\n    Span at T: [ -59 + 3*(T-5), -48 + 3*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 2,3,4: same car? \n  Each has: (-18, -29, right, 6) -> so h=-18, tau=-29, s=6.\n    Span at T: [ -29 + 6*(T-5), -18 + 6*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 5,6,7: \n  Two cars:\n    Car1: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> [ -23 + 12*(T-5), -12 + 12*(T-5) ]\n    Car2: (60, 49, right, 12) -> note: head=60, tail=49? But for right-moving, the representation is [tau, h] so [49,60] at T=5? \n    However, the input gives: (60,49) and direction right. So head=60, tail=49? Then the span at T=5 is [49,60]. Then at T: [49+12*(T-5), 60+12*(T-5)]\n\nBut wait: the update rule for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if the car is given as (h, tau) = (60,49) then the initial span is [49,60]. \n\nSimilarly, for the first car on freeway5: given as (-12, -23) -> so head=-12, tail=-23? Then initial span: [-23,-12].\n\nFreeway8:\n  Two cars:\n    Car1: (12, 1, right, 12) -> head=12, tail=1 -> initial span: [1,12]\n    Car2: (60,49,right,12) -> [49,60]\n\nNow, we are at turn T=5: player at y=4.\n\nWe want to move to y=9. The minimal moves without cars would be 5 moves: U five times. But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must check for each turn and each freeway we step on, whether there is a car that covers 0.\n\nWe are at:\n  T=5: y=4 -> freeway 4.\n\nCheck freeway4 at T=5:\n  The car: span = [-29 + 6*(5-5), -18 + 6*(5-5)] = [-29, -18] -> 0 is not in [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nThen we plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to minimize H, the number of turns. So we try to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid:\n\nFreeway5: at any turn we are on freeway5, we must avoid both cars covering 0.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns from T=5 onward, and we'll try to move up (U) until we can, but if we see that moving up would lead to a collision, we might have to wait (S) or even move down (D) to avoid, but moving down would take us away from 9, so we avoid if possible.\n\nWe are going to compute the positions of the cars for T>=5.\n\nWe are at T=5: y=4 -> safe as above.\n\nNow, we have to choose an action for turn T=5: we can choose U, D, S.\n\nWe want to go to 9, so we prefer U. But we must check if moving to y=5 at the next turn (so at T=6 we are on y=5) is safe.\n\nAt T=6: \n  If we move U at T=5, then at T=6 we are at y=5.\n\nNow, check freeway5 at T=6:\n\n  Freeway5 has two cars:\n    Car1: [-23 + 12*(6-5), -12 + 12*(6-5)] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? The span is [-11,0] -> 0 is the right endpoint? Is 0 included? Yes, because the interval is closed? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". So [-11,0] includes 0. Therefore, if we are on freeway5 at T=6, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot move up at T=5? Because then at T=6 we would be on freeway5 and collide.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose to stay at T=5: then at T=6 we are still at y=4.\n\nBut at T=6, we are on freeway4 again. Check freeway4 at T=6:\n  [-29+6*(6-5), -18+6*(6-5)] = [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nThen at T=6 we can try to move U again? But then at T=7 we would be at y=5.\n\nCheck freeway5 at T=7:\n  Car1: [-23+12*(7-5), -12+12*(7-5)] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe for car1.\n  Car2: [49+12*(7-5), 60+12*(7-5)] = [49+24, 60+24] = [73,84] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo freeway5 at T=7 is safe.\n\nTherefore, one option: \n  T=5: S (stay) -> then T=6: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 at T=6: [-23,-12] safe)\n  T=6: U -> then T=7: y=5 -> and freeway5 at T=7: safe.\n\nThen we are at y=5 at T=7.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=6. So we can try U at T=7: then at T=8 we are at y=6.\n\nCheck freeway6 at T=8:\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  Car1: [-23+12*(8-5), -12+12*(8-5)] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n  Car2: [49+12*(8-5), 60+12*(8-5)] = [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway6 at T=8 is safe.\n\nThen at T=8: we are at y=6.\n\nNow, move to y=7: at T=8 we do U -> T=9: y=7.\n\nCheck freeway7 at T=9:\n  Car1: [-23+12*(9-5), -12+12*(9-5)] = [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  Car2: [49+48,60+48]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at T=9: we are at y=7. Then we want to go to y=8: so U at T=9 -> T=10: y=8.\n\nCheck freeway8 at T=10:\n\nFreeway8 has:\n  Car1: [1 + 12*(10-5), 12+12*(10-5)] = [1+60, 12+60] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  Car2: [49+12*5,60+12*5] = [49+60,60+60]=[109,120] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at T=10: we are at y=8. Then we do U at T=10 -> T=11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from T=5 to T=11, that's 6 actions: \n  T5: S\n  T6: U\n  T7: U (to y=5->6? Wait, let me recount)\n\nWait, let's list:\n\n  T5: start at y=4, action S -> stay at y=4 (T5: freeway4 safe at T5? We were at T5: freeway4 was safe at T5? We already did T5: we started at T5 and we are safe. Then we are going to take actions at T5, T6, ... until we reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt T5: we are at y=4 (given). Then we take an action for T5.\n\nWe decided T5: S -> so at the end of T5, we are still at y=4? But the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nBut note: the turn index: \n  At the beginning of turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at the start of turn t=5: we are at (0,4). \n  Then we choose a_5 -> which is S -> so at the start of turn t=6: we are at (0,4).\n\nThen at turn t=6: we choose a_6 = U -> then at the start of turn t=7: we are at (0,5).\n\nThen at turn t=7: we choose a_7 = U -> then at the start of turn t=8: we are at (0,6).\n\nThen at turn t=8: we choose a_8 = U -> then at the start of turn t=9: we are at (0,7).\n\nThen at turn t=9: we choose a_9 = U -> then at the start of turn t=10: we are at (0,8).\n\nThen at turn t=10: we choose a_10 = U -> then at the start of turn t=11: we are at (0,9). \n\nBut we need to check at each turn when we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) at the start of the turn, that the car on that freeway at that turn does not cover 0.\n\nWe have already checked:\n  t=5: y=4 -> freeway4 at t=5: safe.\n  t=6: y=4 -> freeway4 at t=6: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  t=7: y=5 -> freeway5 at t=7: [1,12] and [73,84] -> safe.\n  t=8: y=6 -> freeway6 at t=8: [13,24] and [85,96] -> safe.\n  t=9: y=7 -> freeway7 at t=9: [25,36] and [97,108] -> safe.\n  t=10: y=8 -> freeway8 at t=10: [61,72] and [109,120] -> safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are only on one freeway per turn. So we only check the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nHowever, we must also check that when we are on freeway4 at t=6, we did check. And for freeway5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut wait: at t=5 we started at y=4, and then we stayed at y=4 for t=6. Then we moved to y=5 at the start of t=7.\n\nBut what about the freeways we skip? We don't check them because we are not on them.\n\nSo the above sequence: \n  t5: S\n  t6: U\n  t7: U\n  t8: U\n  t9: U\n  t10: U\n\nThat's 6 actions and we reach y=9 at the start of turn t11? Actually, at the start of turn t11 we are at y=9. But we are required to reach (0,9) at the end of the sequence? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nt1=5, so the actions are for t=5,6,...,5+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H? Actually:\n\n  After 0 actions: we are at turn 5 (start) -> y_5 = 4.\n  After 1 action (at t5): we are at turn 6 -> y_6.\n  ...\n  After H actions: we are at turn 5+H.\n\nWe require that at the start of turn 5+H, we are at y_{5+H}=9? But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> that is y_{5+H-1}=9.\n\nWait, the indexing: \n  The sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1. So:\n    t1 + 0: first action (at turn t1)\n    t1 + 1: second action\n    ...\n    t1 + H-1: last action.\n\nThen the state after the last action is at turn (t1 + H). But the requirement is that at the turn after the last action, we are at (0,9)? Actually, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is not exactly that.\n\nLet me read: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". But note that after the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1), we update to the next state, which is at turn t1+H. But the requirement is that at the turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? That doesn't make sense because the action at t1+H-1 will change the state to the next.\n\nActually, the player update: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and after that action, we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\nWe require that y_{t1+H-1} = 9? Or y_{t1+H}=9?\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> that would be the state at the start of the last action? But then we do an action and move. So that doesn't get us to 9 at the end.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is the position at the start of the turn when we do the last action? But then we do an action and leave.\n\nI think there is a confusion.\n\nLook: the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1 (total H actions). Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning at the end of the sequence, we are at (0,9). So that should be at the start of turn t1+H? But note: after the action at turn t, we are at the state for turn t+1.\n\nSo we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" in the requirement? Actually, it says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" in the requirement? Let me check.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut that would be: at the start of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at 9? Then we do an action and we move away? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, it might be that the state after the last action is at turn t1+H-1? But that doesn't match the update.\n\nI think there is an indexing issue. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so the actions are for turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after the entire sequence is the state after the last action. The last action is at turn t1+H-1, which updates to state at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, we require that at the start of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is a discrepancy. However, in the problem statement: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note: the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}. So if we take an action at turn t, then the state we are in during turn t is y_t, and we update to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nSo if we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, then at the beginning of that turn we are at y_{t1+H-1}. We take the action and then we become at y_{t1+H}. \n\nThe problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at the end? It says: \"reach (0,9)\". So that should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the problem again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the requirement: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut if we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we are already at 9? Then why do we need to do an action? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that at the beginning of the turn, we are at (0,9). Then we don't need to do an action? But then H=0? But we start at (0,4), so H cannot be 0.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Let me see the update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\". So the state at turn t+1 is after the action at turn t.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn, we must have been updated to that state by the previous action.\n\nTherefore, we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). Then H is the number of actions we take (from t1 to t1+H-1) and then we get to the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis implies that after taking the sequence of H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9? That doesn't make sense because the last action is at t1+H-1, and it will change the state.\n\nAlternatively, the state at the beginning of turn t1 is y_{t1}. Then we take an action at t1, and we get y_{t1+1} at the next turn. Then we take an action at t1+1, and get y_{t1+2}, and so on. After taking the last action at t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo to have the player at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H, we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis must be a typo. It should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut let me check the problem again: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" in the requirement. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider the state at the beginning of the turn as the state for that turn, and we are required to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we do not take an action at that turn? But then the sequence of actions would be for turns t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so the last action is at t1+H-1.\n\nI think the problem means that after H actions, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H is 9? But it writes y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nTo resolve, note that the player position at the start of the turn when we take the k-th action is y_{t1+k-1}. So for k=H, we are at y_{t1+H-1} at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we take the last action a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nThe problem requires that we are at (0,9) at the end. So it must be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly writes: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem has a typo and we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nIn the context, \"turns\" might mean the number of actions? Then H is the number of actions. And we require that after the last action, we are at (0,9). So that is at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which contradicts.\n\nLooking at the example output format: they show actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action. And then after the last action, we are at (0,9). So the last state is at turn t1+H (the turn after the last action).\n\nTherefore, I will assume that the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nSo in our sequence, we have:\n\n  Start: turn 5, y=4.\n  After 6 actions: \n      actions at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10 -> then at turn 11, we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=6.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> y_{5+6-1}=y_{10}=9? But in our sequence, at turn 10 we are at y=8? Then we do an action at turn10 (U) to get to y=9 at turn11.\n\nSo we would have y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the problem's written requirement, we must be at y=9 at the start of turn 10? Then we don't need to do an action at turn10.\n\nHow can we be at y=9 at the start of turn10? Then we must have arrived at turn10 by an action taken at turn9.\n\nSo we need to get to y=9 by the start of turn10.\n\nWe start at turn5: y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 by the start of turn10. That requires 5 moves upward? Because 4 to 9 is 5 moves.\n\nBut we have 5 actions: from turn5 to turn9.\n\nBut we saw that at turn5 we cannot move up immediately because if we move up at turn5, then at turn6 we would be at y=5 and collide with freeway5 at turn6.\n\nSo we have to find a sequence of 5 actions that gets us from y=4 at turn5 to y=9 at turn10.\n\nBut 5 actions: we have to go up 5 times? But then we must do U every time? But we saw that at turn5: if we do U, then at turn6 we are at y=5 and collide.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nAlternative: maybe we can go down? But that seems counterproductive.\n\nOr we can wait and then go up faster? But we have only 5 turns to do 5 moves? Or we can do more than 5 moves? But we want minimal H.\n\nThe problem requires minimal H. So we want the fewest number of actions.\n\nWithout obstacles, H=5 (5 U moves). But with obstacles, we have to avoid.\n\nSo we must find a sequence of 5 actions? Or can we do it in 5 actions?\n\nWe start at y=4 at turn5.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe need to have the net change: +5.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo the number of U must be 5 more than D. So we must have 5 U and 0 D, because 5-0=5.\n\nSo we must do 5 U's.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions.\n\nThe path in terms of y at each turn:\n\n  Turn5: y5=4 -> then we take action a5 -> then y6 = y5 + (1 if U, etc.)\n\nWe need to assign actions for t5, t6, t7, t8, t9: all must be U? Then:\n\n  t5: U -> y6=5\n  t6: U -> y7=6\n  t7: U -> y8=7\n  t8: U -> y9=8\n  t9: U -> y10=9 -> goal.\n\nBut we must check for collisions at each turn:\n\n  At turn5: we are at y5=4 -> freeway4: at t5: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n  At turn6: we are at y6=5 -> freeway5 at t6: \n        Car1: [-23+12*(6-5), -12+12*(6-5)] = [-11,0] -> 0 included -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn5.\n\nThen we must do something else at turn5.\n\nBut we must do 5 U's in 5 actions? Then we have to do U at every turn. But we cannot do U at turn5.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible in 5 actions.\n\nMinimal H must be at least 6.\n\nIn our earlier plan with 6 actions, we have:\n\n  t5: S -> y6=4\n  t6: U -> y7=5\n  t7: U -> y8=6\n  t8: U -> y9=7\n  t9: U -> y10=8\n  t10: U -> y11=9\n\nAnd we checked that:\n\n  t5: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n  t6: y=4 -> freeway4: at t6: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  t7: y=5 -> freeway5: at t7: [1,12] and [73,84] -> safe.\n  t8: y=6 -> freeway6: at t8: [13,24] and [85,96] -> safe.\n  t9: y=7 -> freeway7: at t9: [25,36] and [97,108] -> safe.\n  t10: y=8 -> freeway8: at t10: [61,72] and [109,120] -> safe.\n\nThen at t11: y=9 -> not a freeway, so no car to check.\n\nSo this works in 6 actions.\n\nBut the problem requires: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which would be y_{5+6-1}=y_{10}=9? But in our sequence, at the start of turn10, we are at y=8, and then we do U and get to y=9 at turn11. So y10=8.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the requirement as written, we must be at y=9 at the start of turn10.\n\nSo we need to get to y=9 at turn10.\n\nThen we must have that the action at turn9 gives y10=9.\n\nSo we start at turn5: y5=4.\n\nWe do actions at t5, t6, t7, t8, t9 (5 actions) to get to y10=9.\n\nThe net change: 5.\n\nSo we must have 5 U and 0 D.\n\nSo we do U at every turn.\n\nBut we saw that at turn5: if we do U, then at turn6 we are at y=5 and collide.\n\nTherefore, we must find a way to avoid that collision without adding extra turns? But we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can take a longer path? But we want minimal H.\n\nBut if we do 5 U's, we must do U at turn5, which leads to collision at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must use more than 5 actions.\n\nMinimal H is 6, but then we end at y11=9, which is not at turn10.\n\nBut the problem requires that we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> for H=6, that would be y_{10}=9. But we are at y10=8.\n\nSo we need to be at y10=9.\n\nHow to achieve that?\n\nWe start at y5=4.\n\nWe need to get to y10=9: that is 5 steps upward in 5 actions.\n\nBut we cannot do the first U at turn5.\n\nWe must do 5 U's, but we cannot do U at turn5? Then we must do U at turn6,7,8,9 and one more? But we only have 5 actions.\n\nWe need 5 U's, so we have to do U at every action. There is no alternative.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y10=9 without having done U at turn5? But that causes collision.\n\nSo we must have at least 6 actions, and then we are at y11=9.\n\nBut then y_{10}=8, which is not 9.\n\nThis suggests that the problem has a typo and it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nPerhaps the indexing of the state is different.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem considers the state after the action during the same turn? But the update rule says y_{t+1} = ... so the next turn.\n\nI think the only logical conclusion is that the requirement is y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nAnd the problem's \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is a mistake.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if we can get to y=9 at turn10 without collision? We saw it's impossible with 5 actions.\n\nBut let me try to see if we can use a different route? For example, go down at some point? But then we would need more U's to compensate, which would require more actions.\n\nFor instance, if we do D at turn5, then we go to y=3 at turn6. Then we have to go up 6 times? Then we need 6 actions to get to y=9 at turn11.\n\nBut that would be 6 actions as well.\n\nBut in our original plan we used 6 actions without going down.\n\nSo we stick with 6 actions.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn t1: S   [at turn5: action S]\nTurn t1+1: U [turn6: U]\nTurn t1+2: U [turn7: U]\nTurn t1+3: U [turn8: U]\nTurn t1+4: U [turn9: U]\nTurn t1+5: U [turn10: U]\n\nAnd then at turn11: y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", and with H=6, that would be y_{5+6-1}=y_{10}=9? But we are at y10=8.\n\nSo we have to output the sequence for H=6, but the requirement is not met.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=9 at turn10 by doing:\n\n  t5: ? -> y6\n  t6: ? -> y7\n  t7: ? -> y8\n  t8: ? -> y9\n  t9: ? -> y10\n\nWe require y10=9.\n\nAnd we must have 5 U's and 0 D's.\n\nBut then the only sequence is U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut that causes collision at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=6 and then we are at y11=9, and we hope that the problem meant y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nPerhaps the problem counts the starting turn as turn0? But the current turn is given as t1=5.\n\nI think we have to go with 6 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, we write the actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=6, we write 6 actions.\n\nWe have a valid sequence with H=6 that gets us to (0,9) at turn11.\n\nSo we output that.\n\nBut let me check if there is a sequence with H=6 that gets us to y=9 at turn10? That would be having y10=9, so we must have done an action at turn9 that gets us to y10=9. Then we start at y5=4, and we have 5 actions: t5 to t9.\n\nBut we need net +5, so 5 U's -> collision at turn6.\n\nIf we do 6 actions, we get to y11=9.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem meant y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nSo we proceed.\n\nBut to be safe, let me see if there is a sequence of 6 actions that gets us to y=9 at turn10? No, because 6 actions would get us to turn11.\n\nUnless the last action is not needed? But then we wouldn't do it.\n\nWe must do exactly H actions.\n\nSo I think we are safe.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem considers the state at the same turn after the action? But the update rule clearly states the next state.\n\nWe'll output the sequence of 6 actions as described.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway at each step for safety.\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn5: y=4 -> freeway4: \n  T=5: car: [-29+6*(5-5), -18+6*(5-5)] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nTurn6: y=4 (because we did S at turn5) -> freeway4 at T=6:\n  [-29+6*(6-5), -18+6*(6-5)] = [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nTurn7: y=5 (after U at turn6) -> freeway5 at T=7:\n  Car1: [-23+12*(7-5), -12+12*(7-5)] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Car2: [49+12*2, 60+12*2] = [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nTurn8: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=8:\n  Car1: [-23+12*(8-5), -12+12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n  Car2: [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn9: y=7 -> freeway7 at T=9:\n  Car1: [-23+12*4, -12+48] = [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  Car2: [49+48,60+48]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nTurn10: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=10:\n  Car1: [1+12*(10-5), 12+60] = [1+60,12+60] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  Car2: [49+12*5,60+60]=[49+60,120]? 60+60=120 -> [109,120] -> safe.\n\nThen after turn10: we do U, and at turn11 we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn t1: S\nTurn t1+1: U\nTurn t1+2: U\nTurn t1+3: U\nTurn t1+4: U\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nBut the actions are for turn5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence? We saw that 5 actions are impossible.\n\nWhat if we go up faster in some legs? But we have to go from 4 to 9: 5 steps. We cannot do more than one step per action.\n\nSo minimal is 5, but impossible, so 6 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could potentially do a down move to avoid a car and then go up, but that would require more actions. For example:\n\n  t5: D -> to y=3 at turn6.\n  then we need to go to 9: 6 steps up -> total actions 7? Worse.\n\nSo 6 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: S\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to 5, which is 6 actions.\n\nAnd we have H=6.\n\nNote: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6.\n\nSo this should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). Collision occurs if, at any turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and a car on that freeway has a span that includes the x-coordinate 0.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4) at turn 5.\n- Moving directly up at turn 5 (action \\(U\\)) would position the player at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6. However, at turn 6, freeway 5 has a car with span \\([-11, 0]\\) (computed as \\([-23 + 12 \\times (6-5), -12 + 12 \\times (6-5)]\\)), which includes 0, causing a collision.\n- To avoid this, the player must stay (action \\(S\\)) at turn 5, remaining at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 6.\n- At turn 6, freeway 4 is safe (span \\([-23, -12]\\), no 0).\n- The player can then move up consecutively from turn 6 to turn 10, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\n### Collision Checks for the Sequence:\n- **Turn 5 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 car span \\([-29, -18]\\) (no 0) → safe.\n- **Turn 6 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 car span \\([-23, -12]\\) (no 0) → safe.\n- **Turn 7 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 cars:\n  - Car 1: \\([1, 12]\\) (no 0)\n  - Car 2: \\([73, 84]\\) (no 0) → safe.\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 cars:\n  - Car 1: \\([13, 24]\\) (no 0)\n  - Car 2: \\([85, 96]\\) (no 0) → safe.\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 cars:\n  - Car 1: \\([25, 36]\\) (no 0)\n  - Car 2: \\([97, 108]\\) (no 0) → safe.\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 cars:\n  - Car 1: \\([61, 72]\\) (no 0)\n  - Car 2: \\([109, 120]\\) (no 0) → safe.\n- **Turn 11 (\\(y = 9\\))**: Not a freeway (no cars) → goal reached.\n\nThe sequence requires 6 actions (turns 5 to 10) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. This is minimal, as 5 actions (all \\(U\\)) would cause a collision at turn 6, and no shorter path avoids collisions.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe actions for turns \\(t_1 = 5\\) to \\(t_1 + 5 = 10\\) are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: S \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t=6, and I'm given the car positions at this turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with their head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if they're left or right moving. From the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] → at time T, [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t) = [τ, h] → at time T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-45, -56, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, at time t=6, the span is [τ, h] = [-56, -45], because tail is -56, head is -45, and it's right-moving, so head should be greater than tail.\n\nThe notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says Span(t) = [τ, h], so yes, for right, head is larger, so [tail, head] increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] but decreasing.\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving from the data.\n\nLet me list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-45, τ=-56, d=right, s=3. So at t=6, span is [-56, -45]\n\nFreeway 2: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6. Span: [-23, -12]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6. Span [-23, -12]\n\nFreeway 4: same, [-23, -12]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: first (0, -11, right, 12), so span [-11, 0]? Head=0, tail=-11, right, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSecond car: (-48, -59, right, 12), so [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? First (0, -11, right, 12) → [-11, 0]\n\nSecond (-48, -59, right, 12) → [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6: [-11, 0] and [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 8: (24, 13, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=24, tail=13, right, s=12. But tail=13, head=24, so [τ, h] = [13, 24]? That doesn't make sense because 13 to 24, but it's moving right, so if tail is 13 and head is 24, that means the car is from 13 to 24, moving right, so as time increases, it moves to higher x.\n\nBut the span is [τ, h] = [13,24] for t=6.\n\nSecond car: same as before, [-59, -48]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T. And y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check collision for that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about the freeway you are currently on for collision.\n\nSpecifically: at turn T, you are at position (0, y_T). You take action a_T, which determines Δy, and then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nBut the collision is checked at the moment you are on y_T, for that turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, if y_T = k, and there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in its span at time T, then collision.\n\nAnd since you move after the collision check, I think.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, you are at (0, y_t), then you choose action, which sets y_{t+1}, but the collision is based on where you are now and the cars now.\n\nThe collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is your position at turn T.\n\nSo at the start of turn T, you are at (0, y_T), and if for freeway y_T, at time T, 0 is in some car's span, you collide.\n\nThen, after that, you take action, and move to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note clarifies that if you move to a different y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nSo for example, if at turn T you are on y=k, and you move to y=m, then at turn T, you are on k, so check cars on k at time T. At turn T+1, you are on m, so check cars on m at time T+1, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to get to (0,9), so y=9.\n\nCurrently at t=6, y=4.\n\nI need to go up to y=9, which is 5 steps up, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince I can also stay or go down, but going down might not help since I need to go up, so probably minimal actions involve moving up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 4 to 9, that's 5 steps up, so minimum H=5 if I can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut I need to check if that's possible given the cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no freeways above y=8, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways? The vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars mentioned.\n\nThe problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\" so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nAt y=9, since no freeway, no collision possible, I think.\n\nSimilarly at y=0.\n\nBut I start at y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9, so once I'm at y=9, I'm done, no need to stay or anything.\n\nThe position is (0,9), and since no freeway, no collision.\n\nNow, let's see for each freeway, when is x=0 occupied by a car.\n\nI need for each freeway k, and for each time T, whether 0 is in the span of some car on k at time T.\n\nBut since cars move over time, I need to compute the span at time T.\n\nLet me define t_rel = T - t_1 = T - 6, so relative time from now.\n\nAt absolute time T, the span for a car is based on T - t_1.\n\nSet t = T - 6, so t=0 is current time.\n\nAt relative time t, for a car that at t=0 has head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf d = right, span at time t: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nIf d = left, [h - s*t, τ - s*t]\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, from the data: all directions are \"right\".\n\nFreeway 1: right, freeway 2: right, etc., all say right.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, at relative time t, span is [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nThen 0 is in the span if τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\nSince the span is [τ + s*t, h + s*t] for right-moving.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at time t if there exists a car on k such that τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have the cars.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars and their τ, h, s.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ=-56, h=-45, s=3\n\nSo at time t, span: [-56 + 3t, -45 + 3t]\n\n0 in span if -56 + 3t <= 0 <= -45 + 3t\n\nWhich is 56/3 <= t <= 45/3? Let's solve:\n\n-56 + 3t <= 0 => 3t <= 56 => t <= 56/3 ≈ 18.666\n\n0 <= -45 + 3t => 45 <= 3t => t >= 15\n\nSo for t in [15, 18.666], approximately [15, 18] since t integer? Turns are discrete, I think t integer.\n\nTime is in turns, so t integer.\n\nt relative, T - t_1, and turns are discrete, so t integer.\n\nSo t >= 15 and t <= 18? t <= 18 since 56/3=18.666, so -56 + 3t <=0 for t<=18? Let's compute:\n\nt=18: -56 + 54 = -2 <=0, yes\n\nt=19: -56 + 57 =1 >0, not <=0, so inequality -56+3t <=0 only for t<=18\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -45 +3t => 45 <=3t => t>=15\n\n-45 +3t >=0 when t>=15\n\nFor t=15: -45+45=0, which is equal to 0, so included.\n\nt=14: -45+42=-3<0, not >=0\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision when t=15,16,17,18\n\nt=15,16,17,18 inclusive.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: τ=-23, h=-12, s=6\n\nSpan: [-23 +6t, -12 +6t]\n\n0 in span: -23+6t <=0 <= -12+6t\n\n-23+6t <=0 => 6t<=23 => t<=23/6≈3.833, so t<=3\n\n0 <= -12+6t => 12<=6t => t>=2\n\nSo t=2 and t=3\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? h=-12, τ=-23, s=6, same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-12,-23,right,6), same as freeway 2.\n\nIn the table, freeway 2 and 3 both have the same car? But it might be different cars or same, but we treat separately per freeway.\n\nFor freeway 3, it's the same parameters, so collision at t=2,3\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, t=2,3\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11? Earlier I said τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nSpan: [-11 +12t, 0 +12t] = [-11+12t, 12t]\n\n0 in span: -11+12t <=0 <=12t\n\nLeft: -11+12t <=0 => 12t<=11 => t<=11/12≈0.916, so t<=0 since t integer? t>=0\n\nt=0: -11+0= -11 <=0, true\n\n0 <=12t, which for t>=0, always true except t=0, 12*0=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nt=0: -11+0 = -11 <=0, and 0<=0, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nt=1: -11+12=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span only at t=0.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) head=-48? tail=-59, h=-48? Notation: for this car, head=-48, tail=-59, s=12\n\nSpan: [-59 +12t, -48 +12t]\n\n0 in span: -59+12t <=0 <= -48+12t\n\nLeft: -59+12t <=0 => 12t<=59 => t<=59/12≈4.916, so t<=4\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+12t => 48<=12t => t>=4\n\nSo t=4\n\nThus for freeway 5, at t=0, first car has 0 in span, so collision at t=0 if on freeway 5.\n\nAt t=4, second car has 0 in span.\n\nBut at t=0, we are at t=6 absolute, but relative t=0.\n\nNow for freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? First car: (0,-11,right,12) same, so at t=0, collision.\n\nSecond car same, at t=4 collision.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, collision at t=0 and t=4.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13, s=12\n\nSpan: [13 +12t, 24 +12t]\n\n0 in span: 13+12t <=0 <=24+12t\n\nBut 13+12t >=13>0 for t>=0, so 13+12t <=0 is impossible. Similarly, min is at t=0, 13>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) same as before, span [-59+12t, -48+12t], 0 in span at t=4, as above.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only collision at t=4 from the second car.\n\nFirst car never at x=0.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the times when collision occurs, i.e., when 0 is occupied.\n\nFreeway 1: t=15,16,17,18\n\nFreeway 2: t=2,3\n\nFreeway 3: t=2,3\n\nFreeway 4: t=2,3\n\nFreeway 5: t=0 and t=4\n\nFreeway 6: t=0 and t=4\n\nFreeway 7: t=0 and t=4\n\nFreeway 8: t=4\n\nt is relative time from now, t=0 is current turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at t=0.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt t=0, on freeway 4, collision occurs? Freeway 4 has collision at t=2,3, not at t=0.\n\nFreeway 4 collision at t=2 and t=3, as above.\n\nAt t=0, for freeway 4, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 4: car with τ=-23, h=-12, s=6, span at t=0: [-23, -12], 0 is not in [-23,-12], since -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not included. So no collision at t=0 for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7 have collision at t=0, but we are not on them.\n\nAt t=0, we are on y=4, freeway 4, no collision, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path: we start at y=4, t=0.\n\nWe take actions for t=0 to H-1, and at turn corresponding to t=H-1, we reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative: at time t, we are at y_t, for t=0 to H, where at t=0, y=4, and at t=H, we should be at y=9, but we reach at turn t=H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to H-1 actions, so after H actions, we have done H turns, from time t=0 to t=H-1 relative? Let's clarify.\n\nSet relative time: let τ = 0,1,2,... be the step index.\n\nAt τ=0: current turn, position y=4.\n\nWe take action a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + τ}, we move to y_{τ+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H, and we want y_H =9.\n\nThe position after τ steps is y_τ.\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0 =4\n\nAfter first action, τ=0, we go to y_1\n\nGenerally, after k actions, we are at y_k.\n\nWe take actions at τ=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we are at y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nAnd for each step, at time τ, we are at y_τ, and we must not collide, meaning for freeway y_τ, at time absolute T = t1 + τ = 6 + τ, which relative time t = τ.\n\nSince t_rel = T - t1 = τ.\n\nSo at step τ, we are at y_τ, and we need that for freeway k=y_τ, at time τ, 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nThen we take action, go to y_{τ+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need to find a sequence y_0=4, y_1, y_2, ..., y_H=9, with |y_{i+1} - y_i| <=1, since actions U,D,S change y by +1,-1,0.\n\nAnd for each i from 0 to H-1, at position y_i and time i, no collision.\n\nAt time i, position y_i, check collision.\n\nThen at time H, we are at y_H=9, which is safe.\n\nSince we reach y_H=9 at time H, and we don't need to check collision for y_H because no freeway, or we are done.\n\nThe collision is only checked when we are on a freeway, y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=9, no check needed.\n\nSimilarly, at start y=4, we checked.\n\nNow, minimal H: since we need to go from 4 to 9, minimum 5 steps if all up.\n\nBut we may need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, check if going straight up is possible.\n\nPath: start at y=4, τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4: freeway 4, collision at τ=2,3? But at τ=0, no collision, as span [-23,-12] not include 0.\n\nAction: suppose we go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5: freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars: collision at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=0: collision, but τ=1, is there collision?\n\nFor freeway 5 at τ=1: first car span: [-11+12*1, 12*1] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSecond car: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSo at τ=1, freeway 5 is safe.\n\nThen go to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=6: freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: collision at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=0: collision, but τ=2: first car span: [-11+12*2, 24] = [-11+24,24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen y=7 at τ=3.\n\nFreeway 7 at τ=3: collision times τ=0,4.\n\nAt τ=3: first car span: [-11+36, 36] = [25,36], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen y=8 at τ=4.\n\nFreeway 8 at τ=4: collision at τ=4? Freeway 8 has collision at τ=4 from second car.\n\nSecond car span at τ=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included, since tail -11, head 0? For right-moving, span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so x from -11 to 0, so x=0 is included, yes collision.\n\nAt τ=4, on freeway 8, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=8 at τ=4.\n\nThen go to y=9 at τ=5? But at τ=4, we are at y=8, but if we go up to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4, we need to be at y=8 to move up, but we collide at that time.\n\nIn the sequence: at τ=3, we are at y=7, then we take action to go to y=8 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, when we are at y=8, we check collision for freeway 8 at time τ=4, which has collision, so we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=8 at τ=4.\n\nIn the straight up path, at τ=4 we are at y=8 and collide.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could stay or go down at some point to avoid being on dangerous positions at certain times.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 5.\n\nH is the number of turns, from τ=0 to τ=H-1 actions, y_H=9.\n\nFor straight up, if no collision, we could reach in 5 steps: y1=5, y2=6, y3=7, y4=8, y5=9 at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=8 collide, so not possible.\n\nAt τ=4, we are at y=8 if we went up each time.\n\nBut we might delay going to y=8.\n\nOr go to y=8 at different time.\n\nNow, collision on y=8 only at τ=4, from above.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have collisions at specific times.\n\nList all dangerous (y,t) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- y=1: collision at t=15,16,17,18\n\n- y=2: t=2,3\n\n- y=3: t=2,3\n\n- y=4: t=2,3\n\n- y=5: t=0 and t=4\n\n- y=6: t=0 and t=4\n\n- y=7: t=0 and t=4\n\n- y=8: t=4\n\nAt t=0, y=5,6,7 have collision, but we start at y=4, not on them.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=8 is only dangerous at t=4, we should avoid being on y=8 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,2,3 dangerous at t=2,3.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to go up.\n\nOption: go up to y=5 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=5: freeway 5, at t=1, as before, span [1,12] and [-47,-36], no 0, safe.\n\nThen from y=5, we can go to y=6 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=6: freeway 6, at t=2, span [13,24] and [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nNow at t=2, we are at y=6.\n\nWe want to go to y=7 or something.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2,3,4 have collision.\n\ny=2,3,4 are dangerous at t=2.\n\nBut we are at y=6, not on them.\n\nNow from y=6, we can go to y=7 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=7: freeway 7, at t=3, first car [ -11+36=25, 36], second [ -59+36=-23, -48+36=-12], [-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, y=7.\n\nNow, if we go to y=8 at t=4, we collide, as before.\n\nSo we need to not go to y=8 at t=4.\n\nOptions: at t=3, from y=7, we can:\n\n- Go up to y=8 at t=4: but collide\n\n- Stay at y=7: then at t=4, y=7\n\n- Or go down to y=6 at t=4.\n\nNow, if we stay at y=7 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=7: freeway 7, collision at t=4? Freeway 7 has collision at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, freeway 7: first car span [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], and 0 in [-11,0], yes collision.\n\nSo at t=4, y=7 also collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=6: freeway 6, collision at t=4.\n\nSpan at t=4: first car [-11+48,48]=[37,48], no 0\n\nSecond car [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=4: same, second car has 0 in span.\n\nSo at t=4, freeways 5,6,7,8 all have collision? Let's see:\n\ny=5: at t=4, second car on y=5 has span [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0], 0 in, yes.\n\ny=6: same car? No, each freeway has its own cars.\n\nFor y=5 at t=4: cars on freeway 5: first car [ -11+48, 48] = [37,48], no\n\nSecond car [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], yes 0 in.\n\nSimilarly for y=6: same, both cars, but second car causes collision.\n\ny=7 same.\n\ny=8: second car causes collision.\n\nSo at t=4, all freeways y=5,6,7,8 have collision because of the second car which is on each, but it's per freeway.\n\nThe second car is on multiple freeways? No, each freeway has its own set of cars.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 has its own cars, freeway 6 has its own, etc.\n\nBut in this case, for each of y=5,6,7,8, at t=4, the second car on that freeway has span including 0? For freeway 5,6,7, they all have a car with (-48,-59,right,12), so at t=4, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, the second car is also (-48,-59,right,12), same.\n\nSo yes, at t=4, for y=5,6,7,8, all have collision because of that car.\n\nNow, what about y=4 at t=4? Freeway 4 at t=4: car with τ=-23,h=-12,s=6, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] at t=4, since t=4, s=6, 6*4=24, so [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=4: freeway 3, car τ=-23,h=-12,s=6, same as above, span at t=4: [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=2 same.\n\ny=1: at t=4, freeway 1, car τ=-56,h=-45,s=3, span [-56+12, -45+12] = [-44,-33], no 0.\n\nSo at t=4, only y=5,6,7,8 have collision; y=1,2,3,4 are safe.\n\ny=4,3,2,1 safe at t=4.\n\nNow back to our path.\n\nAt t=3, we are at y=7.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=4, collide.\n\nIf stay at y=7 at t=4, collide.\n\nIf go down to y=6 at t=4, collide.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=4.\n\nAt t=3, we are at y=7, which is one of them.\n\nBut at t=3, we could be at a different y.\n\nIn the earlier path, we went up to y=6 at t=2, then to y=7 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=2, we are at y=6, which is safe at t=2.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=2, instead of going to y=7, we could go down or stay.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince at t=4 we must avoid y=5-8, we could be on y=4 or below at t=4.\n\nBut we start from y=4.\n\nAt t=0, y=4 safe.\n\nt=1, if we go to y=5, safe as before.\n\nThen at t=2, from y=5, we could go to y=4 instead of y=6.\n\nAt t=2, if we go to y=4.\n\nBut at t=2, y=4 has collision? Freeway 4 collision at t=2 and t=3.\n\nAt t=2, freeway 4: span [ -23 +6*2, -12 +12] s=6, t=2, [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], and 0 in [-11,0], yes collision.\n\nSo at t=2, y=4 collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 and y=3 also collision at t=2.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, same car, span at t=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], collision.\n\ny=3 same.\n\nSo at t=2, y=2,3,4 all collision.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 are safe at t=2.\n\ny=5 at t=2: freeway 5, span first car [-11+24,24]=[13,24], no; second [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], no. Safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7 safe.\n\ny=8 at t=2: freeway 8, first car [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], no; second [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], no. Safe.\n\nSo at t=2, dangerous y: 2,3,4; safe y:1,5,6,7,8? y=1 at t=2: freeway 1, span [-56+6, -45+6]=[-50,-39], no 0, safe.\n\ny=1 safe.\n\nSo at t=2, only y=2,3,4 collision; y=1,5,6,7,8 safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=3: y=2,3,4 collision (same reason, span [-11,0] or similar), and y=5,6,7,8? y=5 at t=3: freeway 5, first car [-11+36,36]=[25,36], no; second [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\ny=6,7 same, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=3: first car [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], no; second [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12], no, safe.\n\ny=1 at t=3: freeway 1, span [-56+9,-45+9]=[-47,-36], no, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=3 collision, etc.\n\nSo at t=3, collision on y=2,3,4; safe on y=1,5,6,7,8.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=1,2,3,4 safe.\n\nSince we are going up, we might need to be lower at t=3 or earlier.\n\nStart: t=0, y=4 safe.\n\nt=1: go to y=5 safe.\n\nNow at t=1, y=5.\n\nFrom here, at t=2, we need to go to a safe position.\n\nAt t=2, safe positions: y=1,5,6,7,8\n\nBut y=1 is down, not helpful.\n\nWe can go to y=6 or stay at y=5 or go to y=4 but y=4 collision at t=2.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=1, actions: go up to y=6, or stay at y=5, or go down to y=4.\n\nBut go down to y=4 at t=2: but at t=2, y=4 collision, so not possible.\n\nGo up to y=6 at t=2: safe, as before.\n\nStay at y=5 at t=2: also safe.\n\nSimilarly, we could go to y=7 or y=8, but y=7 from y=5, we need to go through y=6 or directly? Actions change y by 1, so from y=5, we can only go to y=4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, can't jump.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=1, at t=2 we can be at y=4,5,6.\n\nBut y=4 collision at t=2, so only y=5 or y=6.\n\nBoth safe at t=2.\n\nSuppose we go to y=6 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=6.\n\nNow from here, at t=3, we can go to y=5,6,7.\n\nAt t=3, safe positions: y=1,5,6,7,8\n\ny=5,6,7 all safe at t=3.\n\nBut we need to avoid t=4 on high y.\n\nNow at t=3, if we go to y=7, then at t=4 we have problem.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 or go to y=5.\n\nBut at t=4, y=5 and y=6 collision, so if we are at y=6 at t=3, and we stay, at t=4 y=6 collide.\n\nIf we go down to y=5 at t=4, collide.\n\nIf we go up to y=7 at t=4, collide.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=3 we are at y=5, then at t=4, if we stay, y=5 collide; go down to y=4, but y=4 at t=4 is safe? y=4 at t=4 safe, as earlier.\n\ny=4 at t=4: freeway 4, span [1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up to 9.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAlternative: at t=1, instead of going to y=6, we stay at y=5.\n\nSo: t=0: y=4\n\nAction: U to y=5 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=5\n\nAction: S to stay at y=5 at t=2\n\nAt t=2, y=5 safe.\n\nThen from t=2, y=5, we can go to y=4,5,6 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, y=4 collision? y=4 at t=3: freeway 4, span at t=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], and 0 in [-5,6], yes, since -5<=0<=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3 same.\n\ny=5 at t=3: safe, as before.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nSo at t=3, from y=5, we can go to y=5 or y=6 (since y=4 collision).\n\nGo to y=6 at t=3: safe.\n\nThen at t=3, y=6.\n\nBut now at t=4, we need to go somewhere, but y=6 at t=4 collision.\n\nIf at t=3 we stay at y=5, then at t=4 y=5 collision.\n\nProblem at t=4.\n\nWe need to be at y<=4 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=3, we are at y=5 or 6, which are above 4.\n\nFrom t=2, at y=5, we could go down to y=4 at t=3, but at t=3, y=4 collision, not possible.\n\nAt t=2, if we are at y=6, we could go down to y=5 at t=3, but same issue.\n\nBut at t=2, we are at y=5 or 6, both allow us to go to y=5 or 6 at t=3, but then at t=4 we are stuck.\n\nWe need to be at a lower y at t=3.\n\nFor example, at t=3, be at y=4 or below.\n\nBut at t=3, y=4 collision, so not possible.\n\ny=3 at t=3 collision, y=2 collision, y=1 safe but low.\n\nSo at t=3, the only safe positions are y=1,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=1 is low, y=5,6,7,8 are high, all lead to problem at t=4 if we stay or move within, except we can go down to y=4 at t=4 from y=5, but y=4 at t=4 safe.\n\nLet's try.\n\nSuppose at t=3, we are at y=5.\n\nThen at t=3, y=5 safe.\n\nThen we take action to go down to y=4 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, we are at y=4, which is safe, as span [1,12] no 0.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we were at y=5 at t=3, then down to y=4 at t=4.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=4, we can go to y=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=5: freeway 5, at t=5, span first car [-11+60,60]=[49,60], no; second car [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at t=6, and so on.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, at later times, there might be other collisions, but for now, t=4 is the critical point.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach with minimal delay.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster or slower.\n\nStart at t=0, y=4.\n\nInstead of going to y=5 at t=1, we could stay at y=4 or go down, but going down not helpful.\n\nStay at y=4 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=4: freeway 4 at t=1.\n\nSpan: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, y=4.\n\nFrom here, at t=2, we need to go somewhere, but at t=2, y=4 collision, so we cannot stay or go to y=4 at t=2.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=1, we can go to y=3,4,5 at t=2.\n\nBut y=4 collision at t=2, y=3 collision at t=2, so only option go to y=5 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=5: freeway 5 at t=2, span first [13,24], second [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, at t=2, y=5.\n\nThen we can go to y=6 at t=3, safe.\n\nOr stay at y=5 at t=3, safe.\n\nBut then at t=4, we have to be on y=4 or lower to avoid collision.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=3, go down to y=4 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=4, we can go up to y=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=5 safe, as above.\n\nThen to y=6 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=6: freeway 6 at t=6.\n\nCars: first span [-11+72,72]=[61,72], no; second [-59+72,-48+72]=[13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=7: first car [-11+84,84]=[73,84], no; second [-59+84,-48+84]=[25,36], no 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=8: first car [13+96,24+96]=[109,120], no; second [-59+96,-48+96]=[37,48], no 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9, safe, no freeway.\n\nSo we reach at t=9 relative, so H=9 actions? Let's count.\n\ny_t: t=0:4\n\nt=1:4 (if we stay at t=0? No.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nStart t=0, y=4\n\nAction: S (stay), so y=4 at t=1? No.\n\nTime: at τ=0, position y=4\n\nAfter action a0, we go to y1.\n\nI think I confused the index.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet τ be the time step, starting from 0.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action, we go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y_0=4.\n\nWe take actions for τ=0 to H-1, resulting in y_H=9.\n\nFor each τ from 0 to H-1, at position y_τ and time τ, no collision.\n\nThen at τ=H, we are at y_H=9, no need for action or check.\n\nNow, in the sequence I thought:\n\nOption 1: go up directly but collide at τ=4.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOption with waiting:\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, safe\n\nAction: S (stay), so y1=4 at τ=1? When we take action at τ, we move to the next position.\n\nAt time τ, we are at y_τ, take action, go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nThen at time τ+1, we are at y_{τ+1}, and check collision for that position and time.\n\nFor example:\n\n- At τ=0: position y_0=4, time τ=0, check collision: freeway 4, no collision, safe.\n\nThen take action a0.\n\nSuppose a0 = S, so y1 = y0 +0 =4\n\nThen at τ=1: position y1=4, time τ=1, check collision: freeway 4, span at τ=1: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen take action a1.\n\nNow, at τ=1, y=4.\n\nWe need to go to next position at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, if we are at y=4, collision.\n\nSo we cannot have y2=4.\n\nFrom y1=4 at τ=1, we take action to go to y2.\n\nPossible actions: U to y=5, D to y=3, S to y=4.\n\nBut if S, y2=4, at τ=2, y=4 collision.\n\nIf D, to y=3, at τ=2, y=3: freeway 3, at τ=2, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=5, at τ=2, y=5: freeway 5, at τ=2, span [13,24] and [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nSo only choice is to go to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nSo y2=5.\n\nAt τ=2: position y2=5, time τ=2, safe as above.\n\nThen from here, take action a2.\n\nWe can go to y3=4,5,6.\n\nNow at τ=3, time τ=3.\n\nIf y3=4: freeway 4 at τ=3, span [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], collision.\n\ny3=5: freeway 5 at τ=3, span [25,36] and [-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\ny3=6: freeway 6 at τ=3, similar, safe.\n\nSo we can go to y3=5 or y3=6.\n\nSay we go to y3=5 with S, or to y3=6 with U.\n\nBut at τ=4, we need to avoid y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSo if we are at y3=5 at τ=3, we can go down to y4=4 at τ=4.\n\ny4=4 at τ=4: freeway 4, span at τ=4: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y3=6, we can go down to y4=5, but y4=5 at τ=4 collision, or to y4=4, which is safe.\n\nFrom y3=6, we can go D to y4=5 or to y4=4? Actions: from y=6, can go to y=5,6,7.\n\nTo go to y=4, we need to go down twice, not in one step.\n\nFrom y3=6, actions: U to y4=7, D to y4=5, S to y4=6.\n\nNone of these get to y=4 directly.\n\ny4=5,6,7 all collision at τ=4.\n\ny4=5: collide, y4=6 collide, y4=7 collide.\n\nSo if at τ=3 we are at y=6, then at τ=4 we have no safe action; all positions collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=6 at τ=3 if we want to avoid τ=4 collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=3 we are at y=5, we can go down to y4=4.\n\ny4=4 at τ=4 safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be at y=5 at τ=3 and go down to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nOr at lower, but y=5 is the highest we can be at τ=3 to go down.\n\nNow, from the beginning:\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, safe\n\nWe need to reach y=5 at τ=3? Not necessarily, but we need to be at y=5 at τ=3 to go down.\n\nτ=3 position y3.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt τ=0: y0=4, safe\n\nAction: to set y1.\n\nIf we set y1=4 (by S at τ=0), then at τ=1, y1=4, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, action to set y2.\n\nMust set y2=5 (U), so at τ=2, y2=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, action to set y3.\n\nSet y3=5 (S), so at τ=3, y3=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, action to set y4.\n\nSet y4=4 (D), so at τ=4, y4=4, safe.\n\nThen from here, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nAt τ=4: y4=4\n\nAction: U to y5=5\n\nAt τ=5: y5=5, time τ=5\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=5: first car span [-11+60,60]=[49,60], no; second car [-59+60,-48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action: U to y6=6\n\nAt τ=6: y6=6, time τ=6\n\nFreeway 6 at τ=6: first car [-11+72,72]=[61,72], no; second car [-59+72,-48+72]=[13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nThen U to y7=7\n\nAt τ=7: y7=7, time τ=7\n\nFreeway 7 at τ=7: first car [-11+84,84]=[73,84], no; second car [-59+84,-48+84]=[25,36], no 0, safe.\n\nThen U to y8=8\n\nAt τ=8: y8=8, time τ=8\n\nFreeway 8 at τ=8: first car [13+96,24+96]=[109,120], no; second car [-59+96,-48+96]=[37,48], no 0, safe.\n\nThen U to y9=9\n\nAt τ=9: y9=9, reached.\n\nNow, H=9, since we have actions from τ=0 to τ=8, 9 actions, y9=9.\n\nτ from 0 to 8 inclusive, that's 9 steps.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nIs there a shorter path?\n\nFor example, if we go up earlier.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4, go U to y1=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, go U to y2=6 at τ=2, safe.\n\nNow at τ=2, y=6.\n\nInstead of going to y=7, we could go down or stay, but at τ=3, if we go to y=5, for example.\n\nAt τ=2, y=6, action to set y3.\n\nSet to y3=5 (D), so at τ=3, y3=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, go D to y4=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen same as before, go up from there to y9 at τ=9.\n\nSame number of steps.\n\nAt τ=2, from y=6, we could stay at y=6 for τ=3, but then at τ=4 we have problem.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo up to y=7 at τ=3.\n\nBut then at τ=4, if we could go to y=9, but cannot, only to y=8 or stay, both collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps be at y=8 at a different time.\n\ny=8 collision only at τ=4, other times safe.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=8 is safe.\n\nAt τ=3, freeway 8 safe.\n\nThen if we can be at y=8 at τ=3, then at τ=4 we can go to y=9, but at τ=4, we are at y=8? Let's see.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nIf at τ=3, y_3=8, safe.\n\nThen take action U to y_4=9.\n\nAt τ=4, we are at y_4=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached.\n\nBut at τ=4, position y_4=9, time τ=4, but since y=9 not freeway, no collision.\n\nAnd we are done.\n\nBut can we be at y=8 at τ=3?\n\ny=8 at τ=3 is safe, as established.\n\nNow, how to get to y=8 by τ=3.\n\nStart from y=4 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go up 4 steps in 3 actions: from y=4 to y=8 in 3 steps: possible if we go up each time.\n\ny=4 to y=5 (τ=1), y=6 (τ=2), y=7 (τ=3), then to y=8 at τ=4? No.\n\nPositions: at τ=0: y=4\n\nAfter action at τ=0: go to y1\n\nIf U, y1=5 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1: position y1=5\n\nAction at τ=1: U to y2=6 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2: position y2=6\n\nAction at τ=2: U to y3=7 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3: y3=7\n\nNot y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=3, we need y3=8.\n\nFrom y=4, in three actions: y1,y2,y3 with |delta|<=1 each.\n\nMax we can reach y=4+3=7, since each step +1, so y3=7 if all up.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at τ=3.\n\ny_τ at time τ.\n\nAt τ=0: y=4\n\nAfter one action: τ=1, y1 <=5\n\nAfter two actions: τ=2, y2 <=6\n\nAfter three actions: τ=3, y3 <=7\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be at y=8 is τ=4, with y0=4, y1=5, y2=6, y3=7, y4=8.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=8 collision.\n\nSo cannot reach y=8 before τ=4 or after, but at τ=4 collide.\n\nAt τ=5, we can be at y=8, for example.\n\nBut in the previous path, we had to go down to avoid τ=4.\n\nBut with H=9.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by not going down.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=4, since y=1,2,3,4 are safe, we can be there and then go up.\n\nBut we need to be at high y soon.\n\nFor example, start by going up to y=5 at τ=1, then at τ=2, instead of y=6, stay at y=5.\n\nThen at τ=3, stay or go, but to avoid τ=4, we need to be at y<=4 at τ=4.\n\nSo from y=5 at τ=3, go down to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nGo down earlier.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, go U to y1=5\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, go D to y2=4? But at τ=2, y=4 collision, not possible.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, go S to y2=5\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, safe.\n\nThen go D to y3=4 at τ=3? But at τ=3, y=4 collision, not possible.\n\ny3=4 at τ=3 collision.\n\nSo only way is to be at y=5 at τ=3 and go down to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=6 or something, but we cannot reach y=4 from y=6 in one step.\n\nUnless we go down at τ=3 to y=5, but then at τ=4 y=5 collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with the sequence as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nτ=0: y=4, action S, so stay, y1=4\n\nBut at τ=0, action: we take action to set next position.\n\nAnswer should list actions for each turn.\n\nTurn t1: action for turn t1, which is τ=0.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t=6 (τ=0), position (0,4), take action a_{t1} = S (stay), so next position y=4 at τ=1? No.\n\nAfter action, we move to the next position.\n\nIn terms of the turn:\n\nTurn T: at position y_T, take action a_T, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision checked at turn T for y_T.\n\nIn relative: at time τ, position y_τ, take action a_τ, go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nThen at time τ+1, position y_{τ+1}, check collision.\n\nFor the sequence I have:\n\n- At τ=0 (turn 6): y_0=4, take a0 = S (so y1=4)\n\n- At τ=1 (turn 7): y1=4, position (0,4), time τ=1, check collision: freeway 4, span [-17,-6], no 0, safe. Then take a1 = U (up, to y2=5)\n\n- At τ=2 (turn 8): y2=5, position (0,5), time τ=2, check: freeway 5, span [13,24] and [-35,-24], no 0, safe. Take a2 = S (stay, to y3=5)\n\n- At τ=3 (turn 9): y3=5, position (0,5), time τ=3, check: freeway 5, span [25,36] and [-23,-12], no 0, safe. Take a3 = D (down, to y4=4)\n\n- At τ=4 (turn 10): y4=4, position (0,4), time τ=4, check: freeway 4, span [1,12], no 0, safe. Take a4 = U (to y5=5)\n\n- At τ=5 (turn 11): y5=5, position (0,5), time τ=5, check: freeway 5, span [49,60] and [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]? [1,12] is from 1 to 12, 0 not included, so safe. Take a5 = U (to y6=6)\n\n- At τ=6 (turn 12): y6=6, position (0,6), time τ=6, check: freeway 6, span [61,72] and [13,24], no 0, safe. Take a6 = U (to y7=7)\n\n- At τ=7 (turn 13): y7=7, position (0,7), time τ=7, check: freeway 7, span [73,84] and [25,36], no 0, safe. Take a7 = U (to y8=8)\n\n- At τ=8 (turn 14): y8=8, position (0,8), time τ=8, check: freeway 8, span [109,120] and [37,48], no 0, safe. Take a8 = U (to y9=9)\n\n- At τ=9 (turn 15): y9=9, reached.\n\nSo we took actions from τ=0 to τ=8, that is 9 actions, reached at turn t1 + 8? t1=6, actions at t=6 to t=14, position at t=15 is (0,9).\n\nt1 + H -1, with H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we reached at τ=9, after 9 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can reduce.\n\nNotice that at τ=4, we are at y=4, and we go up, but we could have gone up faster before.\n\nFor example, from start, go directly to y=5 at τ=1, then to y=6 at τ=2, then at τ=2 we are at y=6, but we need to be at y=5 at τ=3 to go down, so from y=6 at τ=2, go down to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nThen same as before: at τ=3 y=5, go down to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen go up.\n\nSame number of steps.\n\nAt τ=2, from y=6, go directly to y=7? But then at τ=3 y=7, then at τ=4 we collide if we stay or move.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo H=9 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier by not going down to y=4.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, if we are on y=3 or something, but y=3 at τ=4 is safe, but we need to go up from there.\n\ny=3 to y=9, 6 steps, so at least to τ=10 or more, worse than 9.\n\nSimilarly, start from y=4 at τ=0, go U to y=5 τ=1, then U to y=6 τ=2, then at τ=2, go S to y=6 for τ=3? But at τ=3 y=6 safe, but then at τ=4 y=6 collide.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=7 at τ=3, but cannot avoid τ=4 collision.\n\nSo I think H=9 is the minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nt1=6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: S (since we stay, so at turn 6, action S)\n\nThen turn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: S? In my sequence: at τ=0 (turn 6): action S\n\nτ=1 (turn 7): action U\n\nτ=2 (turn 8): action S (stay at y=5)\n\nτ=3 (turn 9): action D (down to y=4)\n\nτ=4 (turn 10): action U (up to y=5)\n\nτ=5 (turn 11): U (to y=6)\n\nτ=6 (turn 12): U (to y=7)\n\nτ=7 (turn 13): U (to y=8)\n\nτ=8 (turn 14): U (to y=9)\n\nAfter action at turn 14, we go to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nBut at turn 15, we are at (0,9), reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 6 to 14, that's 9 turns, H=9.\n\nWe could have a different sequence with fewer actions.\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately but avoid the collision by being elsewhere at τ=4.\n\nBut we have to be below y=5 at τ=4.\n\nSince we start at y=4, we can stay or go down, but going down delays.\n\nAt τ=0, go U to y=5 τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, go U to y=6 τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2, go D to y=5 τ=3? But at τ=3 y=5, then go D to y=4 τ=4.\n\nSame as before, but in this case, at τ=2 we went down immediately.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0 (t6): y0=4, action U, to y1=5\n\nτ=1 (t7): y1=5, action U, to y2=6\n\nτ=2 (t8): y2=6, action D, to y3=5\n\nτ=3 (t9): y3=5, action D, to y4=4\n\nτ=4 (t10): y4=4, action U, to y5=5\n\nτ=5 (t11): y5=5, action U, to y6=6\n\nτ=6 (t12): y6=6, action U, to y7=7\n\nτ=7 (t13): y7=7, action U, to y8=8\n\nτ=8 (t14): y8=8, action U, to y9=9\n\nReached at τ=9.\n\nSame number, 9 actions.\n\nIn this sequence, we used D at τ=2 and τ=3, but same H.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 later without going down.\n\nFor example, after τ=4, we can go directly up.\n\nBut from y=4 at τ=4, to y=9, need 5 steps: y5=5, y6=6, y7=7, y8=8, y9=9, that's actions from τ=4 to τ=8, 5 actions, but we have to get to τ=4 with y=4, which took 4 actions (τ=0 to 3), so total 9.\n\nIf we can be at higher y at τ=4, but we cannot because of collision.\n\nSo I think 9 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars on other freeways, like y=1 at high t, but since we are not going there, and we reach by τ=9, which is t=15, and y=1 collision at t=15 to 18, but we are not on y=1, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence can be as above.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had an initial stay, but we can avoid that by going up immediately and then down.\n\nIn the second sequence: actions: U, U, D, D, U, U, U, U, U\n\nAt turn t6: U\n\nt7: U\n\nt8: D\n\nt9: D\n\nt10: U\n\nt11: U\n\nt12: U\n\nt13: U\n\nt14: U\n\nAfter t14 action U, to y=9 at t15.\n\nIn this, at τ=2 (t8), we go down from y=6 to y=5, but at that time, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe could have only one down or something, but seems not.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow to write the answer.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for each turn.\n\nAlso, need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, for the second one.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn t1 =6: action U\n\nThen position at t7: y=5\n\nTurn t7: action U, to y=6 at t8\n\nTurn t8: action D, to y=5 at t9\n\nTurn t9: action D, to y=4 at t10\n\nTurn t10: action U, to y=5 at t11\n\nTurn t11: action U, to y=6 at t12\n\nTurn t12: action U, to y=7 at t13\n\nTurn t13: action U, to y=8 at t14\n\nTurn t14: action U, to y=9 at t15\n\nNow, H=9 actions from t6 to t14.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nThe answer format: list for each turn the action.\n\nSince t1=6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nAfter Turn 14 action, we reach (0,9) at turn 15.\n\nBut the turn when we reach is after the last action.\n\nThe sequence should be until we reach.\n\nIn the action list, from t=6 to t=14.\n\nWe can write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=8.\n\nSuppose we reach at τ=8, y8=9.\n\nThen we started from y0=4, need to increase by 5 in 8 steps, possible if we don't go down.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at τ=4.\n\nSuppose at τ=4, we are at y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=4, to y=9 at τ=8, need 5 steps: y4=4, y5=5, y6=6, y7=7, y8=8, y9=9? Positions: after actions.\n\ny at time τ.\n\nAt τ=4, y4=4\n\nThen after action at τ=4, go to y5\n\n...\n\nAfter action at τ=8, go to y9=9.\n\nSo actions at τ=4,5,6,7,8: 5 actions to go from y4=4 to y9=9.\n\nBut we need to get to y4=4 at τ=4.\n\nFrom y0=4 at τ=0, to y4=4 at τ=4.\n\nWith actions: to stay or move, but we need to avoid collisions at τ=1,2,3.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=4, go U to y1=5\n\nτ=1, y=5, go U to y2=6\n\nτ=2, y=6, go D to y3=5\n\nτ=3, y=5, go D to y4=4\n\nAs before.\n\nAt τ=0, go S to y1=4\n\nτ=1, y=4, go U to y2=5\n\nτ=2, y=5, go S to y3=5\n\nτ=3, y=5, go D to y4=4\n\nSame.\n\nCannot reach y4=4 with fewer than 4 actions from start.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the action sequence as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car (24,13,right,12), which I used, but it was fine.\n\nAlso, all good.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9. The sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by moving up when possible but includes downward moves to avoid the collision at relative time \\(\\tau = 4\\) (absolute turn 10), where freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) all have a car spanning \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 6 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), the player is at (0, 4). Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is safe.\n- At turn 7 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), the player is at (0, 5). Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) is safe.\n- At turn 8 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), the player is at (0, 6). Moving down to \\(y = 5\\) avoids future collision and is safe at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- At turn 9 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), the player is at (0, 5). Moving down to \\(y = 4\\) positions the player safely at \\(\\tau = 4\\).\n- At turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), the player is at (0, 4), which is safe. Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) begins the ascent to the goal.\n- From turns 11 to 14 (\\(\\tau = 5\\) to \\(\\tau = 8\\)), moving up each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15 (\\(\\tau = 9\\)) without collisions.\n\nThe actions are chosen to avoid all collision points:\n- \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) collide at \\(\\tau = 2, 3\\).\n- \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) collide at \\(\\tau = 0, 4\\).\n- \\(y = 8\\) collides at \\(\\tau = 4\\).\n- Being at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 4\\) avoids collision, and subsequent upward moves are collision-free.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U\n}",

I can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only check the row I'm currently on for collisions.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their positions, right-moving increase.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars will be at future turns relative to t_1 = 7.\n\nt_1 is given as 7, so current turn is 7.\n\nPlayer is at (0,5) at turn 7.\n\nI need to find actions from turn 7 to turn 7+H-1 such that at turn 7+H-1, y=9.\n\nSince I start at turn 7, and I take actions at turn 7, turn 7+1, ..., up to turn 7+H-1, and after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nLet’s define the turns: let t be the turn number starting from t_1=7.\n\nSo at turn t=7, position y=5.\n\nAfter action a_7, at turn 8, y changes based on a_7, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, and T should be minimized.\n\nSince I start at y=5, and y=9 is 4 above, I need at least 4 up moves, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 4.\n\nNow, about the cars: I need to know for each freeway k=1 to 8, where the cars are at any turn T, and specifically when 0 is in their span.\n\nThe span is given at turn t_1=7, and then for T>7, it changes based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all cars for each row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -42, tail -53, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nHead and tail: at t_1, head h, tail τ, and for right-moving, I think head is the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right, tail on left? Let me see the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for direction.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nh = -42, τ = -53\n\nSince it's right-moving, and h = -42, τ = -53, so -42 > -53, so head is at higher x, so when moving right, x increases.\n\nAt t_1=7, span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? No.\n\nThe initial span is given as (head, tail), but in the update, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) is defined as [τ, h], which is from tail to head, so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], with h left end, τ right end? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so both decrease.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-53 + 3(T-7), -42 + 3(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, I am on row y_T, and for some car on that row, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, as position is (0, y_t).\n\nSo we care about whether 0 is in the car's span at turn T for row y_T.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find when 0 is covered by a car at that row.\n\nSince cars are moving, the times when 0 is covered might be intervals.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on that row when 0 is covered.\n\nAlso, for rows with multiple cars, I need to consider all of them.\n\nLet me list for each freeway k, the cars and their span at time T relative to t=7.\n\nSet t_rel = T - 7, so at t_rel=0, current time.\n\nThen for each car, Span at t_rel is:\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, right, s=3, τ=-53, h=-42\n\nSpan(t_rel) = [ -53 + 3*t_rel, -42 + 3*t_rel ]\n\n0 is in span if -53 + 3*t_rel <= 0 <= -42 + 3*t_rel\n\nSo -53 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= -42 + 3t\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 3t <= 0 => 3t <= 53 => t <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so t <= 17 since t integer? t_rel is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nt_rel is integer, T integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -42 + 3t => 3t >= 42 => t >= 14\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 covered when t_rel >=14 and t_rel <=17, i.e., turns T=7+14=21 to T=7+17=24.\n\nt_rel from 0 to ... so at t_rel=14,15,16,17.\n\nT=21,22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nRight-moving, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-17, -6]\n\nAt t_rel: [ -17 + 6*t_rel, -6 + 6*t_rel ]\n\n0 in span: -17 + 6t <= 0 <= -6 + 6t\n\nFirst: -17 + 6t <= 0 => 6t <= 17 => t <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so t <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6 + 6t => 6t >=6 => t >=1\n\nSo t=1 or 2.\n\nt_rel=1 or 2, T=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-6, -17, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nBut different row, so we consider separately.\n\nFor row 2, same as above, 0 covered at t=1 and t=2? t_rel.\n\nt_rel=1: T=8, t_rel=2: T=9\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAt t_rel=1: span [ -17+6= -11, -6+6=0 ] so [ -11, 0], 0 is included? <= and >=, so yes, 0 is included when the inequality has equality.\n\nSimilarly, t_rel=1: -17+6*1= -11 <=0, and 0 <= -6+6=0, yes.\n\nt_rel=2: -17+12= -5 <=0, 0 <= -6+12=6, yes.\n\nt_rel=0: [ -17, -6], -17<=0? -17<=0 true, but 0 <= -6? 0 <= -6 false, so 0 not in [-17,-6].\n\nSimilarly, t_rel=3: [ -17+18=1, -6+18=12], 1<=0<=12? 1<=0 false, so no.\n\nSo only t_rel=1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: again (-6, -17, right, 6) same as row 2 and 3.\n\nSo row 4 also has 0 covered at t_rel=1,2, T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nSecond car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nFor first car: (h,τ) = (12,1), right, s=12\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [1,12] for right-moving.\n\nAt t_rel: [1 + 12*t_rel, 12 + 12*t_rel]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 12t <= 0 <= 12 + 12t\n\nFirst inequality: 1+12t <=0 => 12t <= -1, impossible since t>=0.\n\nSo never true. Thus 0 never in span for first car on row 5.\n\nSecond car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt t_rel: [-47 + 12*t_rel, -36 + 12*t_rel]\n\n0 in span: -47 + 12t <= 0 <= -36 + 12t\n\nFirst: -47 +12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so t<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +12t => 12t >=36 => t>=3\n\nSo t=3 only.\n\nt_rel=3, T=7+3=10.\n\nThus for row 5, only second car covers 0 at t_rel=3, T=10.\n\nFirst car never covers 0.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as row 5? (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nIdentical to row 5.\n\nSo row 6: 0 covered only at t_rel=3, T=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nSo row 7: 0 covered at t_rel=3, T=10.\n\nNow freeway 8: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12)\n\nh=36, τ=25\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [25,36] for right-moving.\n\nAt t_rel: [25 + 12*t_rel, 36 + 12*t_rel]\n\n0 in span: 25+12t <=0 <=36+12t? 25+12t <=0 impossible for t>=0, so never.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) same as before.\n\nSpan(t_rel) = [-47 +12*t_rel, -36 +12*t_rel]\n\n0 in span when t=3, as before.\n\n-47+12t <=0 <= -36+12t\n\nt>=3 and t<=3, so t=3.\n\nThus for row 8, 0 covered at t_rel=3, T=10.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the turns when 0 is covered, so I must not be on that row at those turns.\n\nAlso, for rows with no cars or never covered, it's always safe.\n\nBut all rows have cars, except let's list:\n\nRow 1: covered at T=21,22,23,24\n\nRow 2: covered at T=8,9\n\nRow 3: covered at T=8,9 (since same as row 2)\n\nRow 4: covered at T=8,9\n\nRow 5: covered at T=10\n\nRow 6: covered at T=10\n\nRow 7: covered at T=10\n\nRow 8: covered at T=10\n\nNow, row 1 has coverage later, but I start at row 5, and need to go to row 9.\n\nRow 9 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, and player can be at y=0 or y=9, which are not freeways, so no cars there, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at T=7.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe path: I need to move from y=5 to y=9, which is up 4 rows, but I might need to go through intermediate rows.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so I have to go through y=6,7,8 to reach 9, but I can stay or move down to avoid bad times.\n\nI need to be on row y at turn T only if at that T, row y is not covered.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\nFor rows 2,3,4: dangerous at T=8 and T=9\n\nRow 5: dangerous only at T=10\n\nRow 6: dangerous at T=10\n\nRow 7: dangerous at T=10\n\nRow 8: dangerous at T=10\n\nRow 1: dangerous at T=21-24, but since I'm going to 9, which is above, I probably don't need to go to row 1, so I can ignore row 1 for now.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 is below, I start at 5, go to 9, so I only care about rows 5,6,7,8 for moving up.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are the freeways I might be on.\n\ny=5 at start.\n\nNow, at T=7, I am on row 5.\n\nIs row 5 covered at T=7? From above, row 5 covered only at T=10, not at T=7, so safe to be here now.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and no cars, I just need to be there.\n\nMinimal turns: ideally, I move up 4 times, from T=7 to T=10, but let's see the actions.\n\nAt T=7, I am at y=5.\n\nAfter action a_7, at T=8, y = y7 + Δy\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9 = y8 + Δy, and so on.\n\nI need to have a sequence where at each turn, when I am on a row, it is not covered at that turn.\n\nAlso, at the turn when I reach y=9, I stop, so that turn I must be on y=9.\n\nNow, let me list the coverage:\n\nTurn T | Row 5 | Row 6 | Row 7 | Row 8\n\nT=7: row 5 not covered (covered only at T=10)\n\nBut at T=7, I am on row 5, and it is safe.\n\nNow T=8: row 5 not covered, row 6 covered? Row 6 is covered at T=10? Row 6 coverage: from above, row 6 covered at T=10 only.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at T=10, row 8 at T=10.\n\nAt T=8, which rows are covered?\n\nFrom above:\n\nRow 2,3,4 covered at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut rows 5,6,7,8: at T=8, row 5 not covered, row 6 not covered (covered at T=10), similarly row 7 and 8 not covered at T=8.\n\nOnly row 6,7,8 covered at T=10.\n\nAt T=8:\n\n- Row 2 covered\n\n- Row 3 covered\n\n- Row 4 covered\n\n- Row 5 safe\n\n- Row 6 safe (not covered)\n\n- Row 7 safe\n\n- Row 8 safe\n\nSimilarly at T=9:\n\n- Row 2 covered\n\n- Row 3 covered\n\n- Row 4 covered\n\n- Row 5 safe\n\n- Row 6 safe\n\n- Row 7 safe\n\n- Row 8 safe\n\nAt T=10:\n\n- Row 5 covered\n\n- Row 6 covered\n\n- Row 7 covered\n\n- Row 8 covered\n\n- Other rows may be covered, but not relevant if I'm not there.\n\nAt T=10, all of rows 5,6,7,8 are covered, so I cannot be on any of them at T=10.\n\nBut I need to be on row 8 or something to move to 9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and move up, or be at y=9 directly, but I start from below.\n\nAt turn T, if I am at y=8 and move up, then at turn T+1, I am at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, I could be at y=9 and stay, but since I want to minimize turns, I should move as soon as possible.\n\nBut at T=10, rows 5-8 are all covered, so I must not be on them at T=10.\n\nThat means I need to be on y=9 before or at T=10, but y=9 is not at T=10 issue.\n\nLet's think about the timeline.\n\nCurrent turn T=7, y=5.\n\nI can take actions.\n\nThe dangerous turn is T=10 for rows 5-8.\n\nAlso, at T=8 and T=9, rows 2,3,4 are covered, but since I am at y=5, and moving up, I don't care about rows 2,3,4, as I won't be on them.\n\nI only need to worry about rows 5,6,7,8 when I am on them.\n\nSpecifically, at T=10, all are covered, so I must not be on any freeway at T=10. That means at T=10, I should be on y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=0 is below, I want to go up, so probably on y=9.\n\nSo I need to reach y=9 by T=10 at latest, but since at T=10, if I am on y=9, it's fine, no issue.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, so it's always safe to be on y=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nBut I start from y=5, going to y=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and move up, or at y=9 directly, but since I move step by step, I need to go through y=8.\n\nThe turn when I arrive at y=9 is when I move up from y=8.\n\nLet T_arrive be the turn when I first reach y=9.\n\nAt that turn, I am at y=9, and it is safe.\n\nBefore that, I was at y=8 at turn T_arrive - 1, and I moved up.\n\nAt turn T_arrive - 1, I am on row 8, which must be safe at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, back to T=10 issue.\n\nAt T=10, row 8 is covered, so I cannot be on row 8 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on row 8 at T=10.\n\nTherefore, if I am on row 8 at some turn, it must not be T=10.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, let's see possible paths to go from y=5 to y=9 quickly.\n\nI need at least 4 up moves.\n\nStart T=7, y=5.\n\nOption 1: move up directly.\n\nSuppose I move up at each turn.\n\nT=7: at y=5, safe. Action U: move to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8: now I am on y=6.\n\nIs y=6 covered at T=8? From above, row 6 covered only at T=10, not at T=8, so safe.\n\nThen action U: move to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9: on y=7, row 7 covered only at T=10, not at T=9, so safe.\n\nThen action U: move to y=8 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10: now I am on y=8.\n\nBut at T=10, row 8 is covered! Oh, collision.\n\nBecause at T=10, 0 is in the car span on row 8.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at T=10.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=10 I am on y=8, which is bad.\n\nThen if I continue, action U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, I am on y=9, safe, but it took 4 actions: T=7,8,9,10 to reach y=8? Let's list:\n\nT=7: start y=5, action U → T=8 y=6\n\nT=8: at y=6, action U → T=9 y=7\n\nT=9: at y=7, action U → T=10 y=8\n\nAt T=10, on y=8, covered, collision.\n\nThen T=10: if I do U, I go to y=9 at T=11, but at T=10 I collided.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=8 at T=10.\n\nIn this sequence, I arrived at y=8 at T=10, which is bad.\n\nI could arrive earlier or later.\n\nBut earlier: I start at T=7 y=5.\n\nTo reach y=8 earlier: if I move up every turn, I can be at y=8 at T=10? From y=5 to y=8 is 3 up moves.\n\nT=7: y=5\n\nAfter first U: T=8 y=6\n\nAfter second U: T=9 y=7\n\nAfter third U: T=10 y=8\n\nSo at T=10 y=8, bad.\n\nIf I move faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so I cannot reach y=8 before T=10 from start.\n\nT=7 y=5, min to y=8 is T=10 with three up moves.\n\nSimilarly to y=9 is T=11 with four up moves.\n\nBut at T=10, if I am on y=8, it's covered.\n\nSo I need not to be on y=8 at T=10.\n\nTherefore, I must be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow, row 8 is only covered at T=10, from above.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 covered only at T=10, row 6 at T=10, row 5 at T=10.\n\nSo for each of rows 5,6,7,8, they are safe except at T=10 when they are all covered.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid being on any of rows 5,6,7,8 at turn T=10.\n\nThat means at turn T=10, I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4 are covered at T=10? Let's see.\n\nEarlier I only looked at rows 5-8 for coverage, but rows 1-4 also have coverage at some times.\n\nAt T=10:\n\nWhat about row 1? Row 1 covered at T=21-24, not at T=10.\n\nRow 2 covered at T=8 and 9, not at T=10.\n\nSimilarly row 3 at T=8,9, not T=10.\n\nRow 4 at T=8,9, not T=10.\n\nSo at T=10:\n\n- Row 1: safe\n\n- Row 2: safe (not covered)\n\n- Row 3: safe\n\n- Row 4: safe\n\n- Row 5: covered\n\n- Row 6: covered\n\n- Row 7: covered\n\n- Row 8: covered\n\n- Row 9: always safe\n\nSo at T=10, only rows 5-8 are covered; rows 1-4 and 9 are safe.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at T=10, I must not be on rows 5,6,7,8 at that turn. So I should be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or y=9.\n\nSince I am going to y=9, probably on y=9 or on a lower row.\n\nBut if I am on y=9 at T=10, it's fine.\n\nIf I am on a lower row, I need to move up later.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI start at T=7, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe constraint is that at T=10, I cannot be on rows 5-8.\n\nSo possible strategies:\n\n1. Reach y=9 before T=10.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nFrom T=7 y=5, to y=9, I need to increase y by 4, so minimum 4 turns: if I move up each turn from T=7 to T=10.\n\nT=7: action U, go to y=6 at T=8\n\nT=8: action U, go to y=7 at T=9\n\nT=9: action U, go to y=8 at T=10\n\nBut at T=10, I am on y=8, which is bad, and I haven't reached y=9 yet.\n\nThen to go to y=9, I need T=11: action U, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut I was on y=8 at T=10, collided.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nIf I move faster, but I can't.\n\nAnother way: I could stay or move down to delay.\n\nBut I want to go up.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier? No, from y=5, min to y=9 is 4 up moves, arriving at T=11.\n\nT=7: start, after action, position at next turn.\n\nAt turn T, after action, position changes at T+1.\n\nDefine the position at the start of turn or after action.\n\nIn the game dynamics:\n\nAt turn t, player position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAnd at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision at turn T if when position is (0, y_T), and y_T is freeway, and 0 in car span on that row at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, when we are at position, we check for collision.\n\nFor example, at T=7, we are at (0,5), row 5, and we need to check if covered at T=7. Not covered, safe.\n\nThen we take action a_7, which determines y_8.\n\nAt T=8, we are at (0, y_8), and check collision based on y_8 and T=8.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to have y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nAt that T, we are at y=9, no collision.\n\nThe turn before, we were at y=8 and moved up.\n\nNow, from start T=7 y=5.\n\nIf I do all U:\n\na_7 = U: then y_8 = 6\n\nAt T=8, position (0,6), row 6, is it covered? At T=8, row 6 not covered (only at T=10), so safe.\n\na_8 = U: y_9 = 7\n\nAt T=9, position (0,7), row 7, not covered at T=9 (covered at T=10), safe.\n\na_9 = U: y_10 = 8\n\nAt T=10, position (0,8), row 8, covered at T=10, collision! Bad.\n\nThen a_10 = U: y_11 = 9\n\nAt T=11, position (0,9), safe, but collided at T=10.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nTo avoid being on row 8 at T=10, I need to be on row 8 at a different time or skip it.\n\nBut row 8 is only dangerous at T=10, so other times are safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo I need to schedule my position so that when I am on rows 5,6,7,8, it is not at T=10.\n\nSpecifically, for row 8, I must be on it at some T ≠ 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince I start at y=5 at T=7, and y=5 is safe at T=7.\n\nThen I need to move to y=6, but y=6 must be at T≠10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, T=10 is the only dangerous time for rows 5-8.\n\nOther times are safe for these rows.\n\nFor example, at T=7, row 5 safe.\n\nT=8, row 6 safe, etc.\n\nBut at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSo to go from y=5 to y=9, I need to pass through y=6,7,8 at some points.\n\nThe times I am on these rows must not be T=10.\n\nFor instance, I can be on y=6 at T=8 or T=9 or T=11, etc., but not T=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, not at T=10.\n\ny=8 not at T=10.\n\ny=5 not at T=10, but I start at T=7, which is before.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=9, safe.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=10, that means at T=9, I was at y=8 and moved up.\n\nSo at T=9, position y=8, and I do U, to y=9 at T=10.\n\nNow, at T=9, I am on y=8, which must be safe.\n\nAt T=9, is row 8 covered? From above, row 8 covered only at T=10, not at T=9, so yes, safe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at T=9.\n\nStart at T=7 y=5.\n\nFrom T=7 to T=9, two turns.\n\nTo go from y=5 to y=8, need +3, but in two actions, I can only change by at most +2, so impossible to reach y=8 at T=9.\n\ny at T=9 is determined by actions at T=7 and T=8.\n\ny_9 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\ny_7=5, Δy_7 and Δy_8 each in {-1,0,1}, so y_9 between 5-2=3 and 5+2=7.\n\nCannot be 8 at T=9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach y=9 at T=10.\n\nNext, reach at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=11, I must be at y=8 at T=10 and move up? No.\n\nAt T=10, position y_10, action a_10, then y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\nIf y_11=9, then at T=11, position (0,9)\n\nAnd at T=10, I was at y_10.\n\nIf y_10=8 and a_10=U, then y_11=9.\n\nBut at T=10, if y_10=8, and row 8 covered, collision.\n\nIf y_10=9 and a_10=S or D, but y_10=9 would mean I reached earlier.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=11, possible ways:\n\n- At T=10, y_10=8, a_10=U, then y_11=9\n\n- Or at T=10, y_10=9, a_10=S, then y_11=9, but if already at 9, no need to move, but we can stay.\n\nBut to minimize turns, if I reach earlier, H smaller.\n\nBut in this case, I can't reach before T=11 with all U, but with all U I reach y=8 at T=10, then y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=10 y=8 collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nOther paths.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, be at y=8 at T=9 or T=11, etc.\n\nBut at T=9, as above, cannot be at y=8.\n\ny at T=9: min y=3, max y=7, as above.\n\nSo y=8 not possible at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8: y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7 = 5 + {-1,0,1}, so y_8=4,5,6.\n\nNot 8.\n\nAt T=7, y=5.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=8 is T=10, with three up moves: T=7 U to y=6 T=8, T=8 U to y=7 T=9, T=9 U to y=8 T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, collision.\n\nI can be at y=8 later, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=11: how?\n\nFrom T=10 to T=11, but at T=10 I need to be somewhere.\n\nLet's list possible sequences.\n\nI need to have the move to y=9 from y=8 at some turn when y=8 is safe.\n\ny=8 is safe except at T=10.\n\nSo I can be on y=8 at T=9? Impossible.\n\nT=11: possible.\n\nOr earlier, not possible.\n\nSo only possible to be on y=8 at T=11 or later.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nFirst, at T=10, I must not be on rows 5-8, so I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or y=9.\n\nSince I am at y=5 at T=7, and I want to go up, y=9 is better.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at T=10, I need to be at y=8 at T=9, which is impossible.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=9 at T=10.\n\nTherefore, at T=10, I must be on one of y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSay, I go down to a lower row at T=10 to avoid, then go up later.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=10, I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9, which is 5 up moves, so at least 5 turns from there, so total turns more.\n\nBut let's see the minimal.\n\nFirst, from start T=7 y=5.\n\nI can do actions to be at a safe row at T=10.\n\nFor example, at T=10, I can be on y=4 or y=3, etc.\n\nBut let's see how to get there.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen from y=5 at T=7, I need to decrease y by 1 in three turns? Not necessarily, I can move down or stay.\n\ny_10 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\ny_7=5, Δy_t in {-1,0,1} for t=7,8,9.\n\nSo y_10 = 5 + sum_{t=7 to 9} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t >= -1, <=1, so y_10 between 5-3=2 and 5+3=8.\n\nBut at T=10, I cannot be on 5-8, so y_10 must be 2,3,4 or 9, but 9 impossible since max 8, so y_10 must be 2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, min 2, so y=2,3,4.\n\nSo at T=10, I must be on y=2,3, or 4.\n\nAnd these are safe at T=10, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nWhich requires at least 5,6, or 7 up moves, depending on where I am.\n\nMinimal when at y=4, need 5 up moves to y=9.\n\nThen I can reach y=9 at T=10 + 5 = T=15, but let's see.\n\nT=10 at y=4, then after actions, at T=11 y=5 or etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid rows 5-8 at T=10, but at other times they are safe except T=10.\n\nSo after T=10, I can move up freely, as long as not at T=10.\n\nFor example, from T=10 at y=4, I can move up each turn to y=9 at T=14? Let's calculate.\n\nAt T=10, position y=4.\n\nAction a_10: then y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\nIf a_10=U, y_11=5\n\nThen at T=11, position (0,5), row 5.\n\nNow, at T=11, is row 5 covered? Row 5 covered only at T=10, not at T=11, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can move up: a_10=U to y=5 T=11\n\na_11=U to y=6 T=12\n\na_12=U to y=7 T=13\n\na_13=U to y=8 T=14\n\na_14=U to y=9 T=15\n\nAt T=15, y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? Probably not, since I wasted time going down.\n\nIn this case, from T=7 to T=10, I need to get to y=2,3,4 at T=10.\n\nFor example, to y=4.\n\ny_10=4.\n\ny_7=5, so I need to decrease by 1 in three actions.\n\nFor example, I can do two S and one D, or one D and two S, etc.\n\nBut I need to make sure that at each turn, when I am on a row, it is safe.\n\nNow, during T=7 to T=9, I am on some rows.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nT=7: start y=5, safe.\n\nThen action a_7, to y_8.\n\nT=8: position y_8, must be safe.\n\nAt T=8, which rows are covered? Rows 2,3,4 are covered at T=8.\n\nBut I am at y=5 or whatever.\n\ny_8 could be 4,5,6.\n\nIf y_8=4, row 4 covered at T=8, so collision.\n\nIf y_8=5, row 5 safe at T=8.\n\nIf y_8=6, row 6 safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: rows 2,3,4 covered.\n\ny_9 could be from 3 to 7, depending.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, and y_8 from 4 to6, so y_9 from 3 to7.\n\nIf y_9=3 or4, row covered at T=9.\n\nIf y_9=5,6,7 safe.\n\nThen T=10: must be y=2,3,4, but if y=3 or4, row 3 or4 not covered at T=10, safe.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, if I am on row 3 or4, it is covered, so I cannot be on them at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSimilarly for row 2.\n\nSo to be safe, at T=8, I must not be on row 2,3,4, so y_8 must be 5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, must not be on row 2,3,4, so y_9 must be 5,6,7.\n\nThen at T=10, must not be on row 5,6,7,8, so y_10 must be 0,1,2,3,4 or9, but y=9 impossible, so y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut from above, at T=9, y_9 must be 5,6,7.\n\nThen y_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nIf y_9=5,6,7, then y_10 = y_9 + {-1,0,1}, so y_10 between 4 and 8.\n\nBut at T=10, y_10 must be <=4 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y_10 <=4.\n\nSo from y_9=5,6,7, to y_10<=4, I need to move down, so Δy_9 = D.\n\nThen y_10 = y_9 -1.\n\nSo if y_9=5, y_10=4\n\ny_9=6, y_10=5\n\ny_9=7, y_10=6\n\nBut at T=10, y_10 must be <=4, so only possible if y_9=5 and y_10=4.\n\nIf y_9=6, y_10=5, but y=5 at T=10 covered, not allowed.\n\nSimilarly y_9=7, y_10=6, covered.\n\nSo only possibility: at T=9, y_9=5, then a_9=D, so y_10=4.\n\nThen at T=10, y=4, which is safe.\n\nNow, at T=9, y=5, is it safe? Row 5 at T=9: covered only at T=10, not at T=9, so safe.\n\nNow, back to earlier.\n\nAt T=8, y_8 must be 5 or 6.\n\nAnd at T=9, y_9 must be 5, but from above we need y_9=5.\n\ny_9=5.\n\nNow, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\ny_8 is 5 or 6.\n\nIf y_8=5, then to have y_9=5, need Δy_8=0, so a_8=S\n\nIf y_8=6, then to have y_9=5, need Δy_8=D, so a_8=D\n\nNow, also at T=8, if y_8=5, safe; if y_8=6, safe.\n\nNow, at T=7, y=5, action a_7 to y_8.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7 = 5 + Δy_7\n\nΔy_7 in {-1,0,1}, so y_8=4,5,6.\n\nBut at T=8, y_8 must be 5 or 6, so y_8 cannot be 4, because if y_8=4, row 4 covered at T=8, collision.\n\nTherefore, y_8 must be 5 or 6, so Δy_7 cannot be D, must be S or U.\n\nIf a_7=S, y_8=5\n\nIf a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nIf a_7=D, y_8=4, not allowed.\n\nSo a_7 cannot be D.\n\nNow, cases:\n\nCase 1: a_7=S, then y_8=5\n\nThen at T=8, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, need y_9=5, so a_8 must be S, so y_9=5\n\nThen a_9=D, y_10=4\n\nAt T=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can move up to y=9.\n\nAt T=10, y=4\n\nAction a_10=U, to y=5 at T=11\n\nAt T=11, y=5, row 5 safe (not T=10), so ok.\n\na_11=U, to y=6 at T=12\n\nT=12, y=6 safe\n\na_12=U, to y=7 at T=13\n\nT=13, y=7 safe\n\na_13=U, to y=8 at T=14\n\nT=14, y=8 safe (not T=10)\n\na_14=U, to y=9 at T=15\n\nT=15, y=9, done.\n\nH=8 actions? From t=7 to t=14, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, 8 actions, arrive at T=15.\n\nBut earlier I thought to reach at T=11, but not possible.\n\nCase 2: a_7=U, then y_8=6\n\nAt T=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen need y_9=5, so a_8 must be D, so y_9=5\n\nAt T=9, y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_9=D, y_10=4\n\nAt T=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen same as above, from y=4 at T=10, move up to y=9 at T=15.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nBut in this case, I moved up then down, wasted.\n\nNow, can I reach faster?\n\nFor example, after T=10 at y=4, I need to go to y=9, 5 steps, but perhaps I can be at higher row at T=10, but at T=10, I must be at y<=4, so y=4 is highest possible at T=10.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 5 up moves, so arrive at T=15.\n\nBut total from start: actions from t=7 to t=14, 8 actions, position at T=15.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and at turn t_1+H-1, position y=9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=7, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, so H=8, and at turn t_1+H-1=7+8-1=14, position? After action at t=14, y at T=15.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action, then position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter last action, at turn t_1+H-1, we perform action, then position becomes y_{t_1+H}, and we should have y_{t_1+H} =9.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 +0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, at turn (t_1 + H-1) +1 = t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t_1, then at t_1+1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, start at t_1=7, y=5, to y=9 at T= t_1 + H.\n\nWith the sequence above, y at T=15, so t_1 + H =15, t_1=7, so H=8.\n\nBut perhaps I can do better.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can be on y=9 at T=10 or earlier, but we saw not possible.\n\nOr at T=11.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=11, y=9.\n\nTo have y_11=9, it must be that at T=10, y_10 and a_10 such that y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10 =9.\n\nSo if y_10=8, a_10=U; or y_10=9, a_10=S or D, but if y_10=9, it means I reached earlier.\n\nIf I reach y=9 at T=10, then at T=10, y=9, safe, but is it possible?\n\ny_10=9.\n\ny_10 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\ny_7=5, each Δy <=1, so y_10 <= 5+3=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before T=11.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, y_11=9.\n\ny_11 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 + Δy_10\n\n= 5 + sum_{t=7 to 10} Δy_t\n\nEach <=1, so y_11 <= 5+4=9, so possible only if all Δy=U, y_11=9.\n\nBut with all U, y_11=9, but at T=10, y_10=8, which is covered, collision.\n\nIf I have some S or D, y_11<9, not 9.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at T=11, I must have four U in the actions from t=7 to t=10.\n\nBut with four actions, from t=7 to t=10, actions at t=7,8,9,10.\n\ny_11 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 + Δy_10\n\nSince y_7=5, and y_11=9, so sum of four Δy must be +4, so all must be U.\n\nBut then y_10 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 = 5 + U + U + U = 8 at T=10, which is covered, collision.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at T=11 without collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12: possible?\n\ny_12=9.\n\nThen y_12 = 5 + sum_{t=7 to 11} Δy_t\n\nFive actions, sum must be +4 to go from 5 to 9.\n\nSo I can have four U and one S, or three U and two D, but to have net +4, with five actions, I must have four U and one other, which could be S or D.\n\nIf I have one S, net +4, y_12=9.\n\nIf I have one D, net +3, y_12=8, not 9.\n\nSo must have four U and one S.\n\nNow, the S can be at any of the five actions.\n\nBut I need to avoid collision at each turn.\n\nSpecifically, at T=10, I must not be on rows 5-8.\n\nAlso at other turns, when on a row, not covered.\n\nNow, the turns from T=7 to T=11.\n\nT=7: start y=5, safe.\n\nAfter actions, y at T=8,9,10,11.\n\ny_11 is not the position when we reach, y_12 is the position at T=12.\n\nTo have y_12=9, we need to arrive at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, position (0,9)\n\nWe take actions from t=7 to t=11, H=5 actions? Actions at t=7 to t=11, that's 5 actions, then at T=12, y=9.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so actions at 7,8,9,10,11 for H=5, then T=12 position.\n\nNow, with four U and one S.\n\nThe S means I stay at some point, so I progress slower.\n\nBut I need to ensure that at T=10, I am not on rows 5-8.\n\ny at T=10: y_10 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nSince y_7=5, and three actions.\n\ny_10 can be from 2 to 8.\n\nBut at T=10, must be <=4.\n\nSo y_10 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, during the process.\n\nLet me denote the actions.\n\nLet the actions be a7, a8, a9, a10, a11 for H=5, but we may have fewer, but let's see.\n\nFirst, y at each turn:\n\nT=7: y=5, safe\n\nAfter a7, y8 = 5 + Δy7\n\nT=8: position y8, must be safe. y8 must be 5 or 6, as before, because if y8=4, covered at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: y9 must be 5,6,7 to be safe, as row 2,3,4 covered.\n\nT=10: y10 must be <=4 to be safe.\n\nThen T=11: y11, must be safe. At T=11, which rows covered?\n\nFrom earlier, row 5 covered only at T=10, so at T=11 safe, similarly all rows except row 1 at later times, so all safe at T=11.\n\nThen T=12: y12=9.\n\nNow, y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\ny10 <=4, and y12=9.\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nBut y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nAnd y12 = y11 + Δy11 = (y10 + Δy10) + Δy11\n\nAlso, y12 =9, y10 <=4.\n\nSince y12=9, and y10 <=4, I need to increase by at least 5 in two steps? From y10 to y12.\n\ny10 at T=10, y11 at T=11, y12 at T=12.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\ny12=9, y10 <=4, so Δy10 + Δy11 >=5\n\nBut each Δy <=1, so impossible, max increase 2, from 4 to 6, not to 9.\n\ny10 <=4, y11 <= y10 +1 <=5, y12 <= y11 +1 <=6, so y12 <=6 <9, impossible.\n\nMistake.\n\ny10 at T=10, position.\n\nThen after action a10, y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nAt T=11, position y11.\n\nThen action a11, y12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nAt T=12, position y12=9.\n\ny10 <=4, y11 <= y10 +1 <=5, y12 <= y11 +1 <=6.\n\nSo y12 <=6, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at T=12 if at T=10 I am at y<=4.\n\nSimilarly, for any earlier arrival, we have issue.\n\nNow, to reach at T=15 as before.\n\nBut H=8.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by not going down to y=4, but to a row where I can jump or something, no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can be on y=8 at T=11.\n\nThen from there move to y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at T=11.\n\ny_11 =8.\n\ny_11 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 + Δy_10\n\n=5 + sum of four Δy\n\nTo have y_11=8, net +3, so three U and one S, or two U and one D and one S, etc., but net +3.\n\nBut at T=10, I must not be on rows 5-8, so y_10 <=4.\n\ny_10 <=4.\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy10\n\nIf y_10 <=4, y_11 <=5, but I want y_11=8, impossible.\n\ny_11 <= y_10 +1 <=5 <8.\n\nSo cannot have y_11=8.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on high rows at T=11 if at T=10 I am low.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=9 at T=11 or later, but at T=11, as before, only possible with all U but collision at T=10.\n\nSo the minimal is to be at y=4 at T=10, then move up to y=9 at T=15.\n\nH=8 actions from t=7 to t=14.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach faster by choosing different path.\n\nPerhaps I can go to a different row at T=10.\n\nFor example, to y=3 or y=2, but that would be lower, take more turns to go up.\n\ny=4 is best.\n\nOr, another thought: at T=10, I can be on y=9, but impossible as y_10<=8.\n\nOr, perhaps I can avoid T=10 by being on a row not covered, but rows 5-8 are covered only at T=10, so other times safe, but I have to pass through them at other times.\n\nBut the problem is that T=10 is exactly when I would be on y=8 if I move fast, but I can delay or advance.\n\nBut advancing not possible, delaying means I stay or move down before T=10.\n\nIn the sequence where I go to y=6 at T=8, then to y=5 at T=9, then to y=4 at T=10, as in case 2.\n\nThen from T=10 y=4, I move up.\n\nBut to minimize, I need to start moving up immediately after.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps: U to y=5 T=11, U to y=6 T=12, U to y=7 T=13, U to y=8 T=14, U to y=9 T=15.\n\nT=15.\n\nTotal actions from t=7 to t=14: t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, that's 8 actions.\n\nH=8.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at T=14.\n\nFor example, if at T=10 I am at y=4, but if I can be at higher at T=10, but I can't.\n\nOr, during the down phase, I can be at higher row.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, at T=8 I can be at y=6.\n\nThen at T=9 y=5, T=10 y=4.\n\nThen from T=10 y=4 to T=11 y=5, etc., up to T=15.\n\nIf at T=9 I am at y=6 or 7, but earlier we need y_9=5 to go to y_10=4.\n\nIf I am at y=7 at T=9, but then to have y_10<=4, I need to move down, y_10=6, but y=6 at T=10 covered, not allowed.\n\nSo only y_9=5 with a_9=D to y_10=4.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let's see if I can save a turn by moving up faster after T=10.\n\nNo, because I have to go from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but at T=10 I am at y=4.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at T=14.\n\nFor example, if at T=10 I am at y=5, but at T=10 y=5 covered, not possible.\n\nOr, another idea: perhaps I can be on y=8 at T=9, but impossible.\n\nOr at T=11.\n\nTo be on y=8 at T=11.\n\ny_11=8.\n\ny_11 = 5 + sum_{t=7 to 10} Δy_t\n\nFour actions, net +3 to y=8.\n\nSo three U and one S, or other combinations net +3.\n\nBut at T=10, y_10 must be <=4.\n\ny_10 <=4.\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy10 <=4 +1=5 <8, contradiction.\n\nSo impossible to have y_11=8 if y_10<=4.\n\nSimilarly, y_11 <=5.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at T=12, y_12 = y_11 + Δy11 <=5+1=6<9, impossible.\n\nThus, the earliest possible is to be at y=4 at T=10, then y=5 at T=11, ..., y=9 at T=15.\n\nSo H=8 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I can choose either to stay at first or move up.\n\nFor example, sequence 1: all to stay at y=5 until T=9, then down.\n\na7=S: at T=8 y=5\n\na8=S: at T=9 y=5\n\na9=D: at T=10 y=4\n\nThen a10=U: T=11 y=5\n\na11=U: T=12 y=6\n\na12=U: T=13 y=7\n\na13=U: T=14 y=8\n\na14=U: T=15 y=9\n\nH=8, actions at t=7 to 14.\n\nAt each turn, we need to check collision.\n\nT=7: y=5, safe\n\nT=8: y=5, row 5 not covered at T=8 (only T=10), safe\n\nT=9: y=5, row 5 not covered at T=9, safe\n\nT=10: y=4, row 4 not covered at T=10 (covered only at T=8,9), safe\n\nT=11: y=5, row 5 not covered at T=11, safe\n\nT=12: y=6, row 6 not covered at T=12, safe\n\nT=13: y=7, row 7 not covered at T=13, safe\n\nT=14: y=8, row 8 not covered at T=14, safe\n\nT=15: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSequence with moving up first:\n\na7=U: to y=6 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=6, safe\n\na8=D: to y=5 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=5, safe\n\na9=D: to y=4 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=4, safe\n\nThen same as above: a10=U to y=5 T=11, etc., up to a14=U to y=9 T=15.\n\nAlso H=8.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=7?\n\nIf H=7, actions at t=7 to t=13, then at T=14, y=9.\n\nt_1+H =7+7=14, y=9.\n\ny_14=9.\n\ny_14 =5 + sum_{t=7 to 13} Δy_t\n\nSeven actions, net +4 to go from 5 to 9.\n\nSo I need four U and three S or D, but net +4.\n\nNow, at T=10, I must have y_10 <=4.\n\ny_10 =5 + sum_{t=7 to 9} Δy_t\n\nThree actions, so y_10 between 2 and 8.\n\nBut must <=4.\n\nThen from y_10 <=4, to y_14=9, need to increase by at least 5 in four actions (from T=10 to T=13 actions).\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy10\n\ny_12 = y_11 + Δy11\n\ny_13 = y_12 + Δy12\n\ny_14 = y_13 + Δy13\n\ny_14 = y_10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\ny_10 <=4, y_14=9, so sum of four Δy >=5.\n\nEach <=1, so possible only if all four are U, sum=4, but 4<5, impossible to have >=5.\n\nMax sum=4, so y_14 <= y_10 +4 <=4+4=8<9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at T=14 if y_10<=4.\n\nIf y_10=4, y_14<=8.\n\nIf y_10=3, y_14<=7, etc.\n\nThus impossible to reach at T=14.\n\nSimilarly for earlier.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8, with y=9 at T=15.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence, I have to specify from turn t_1=7.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 8 has two cars, but we used the coverage.\n\nIn the sequence, I can choose the first one or the second.\n\nLet's take the first sequence: all stay then down then up.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1: S  (a_7=S)\n\nTurn t_1+1: S  (a_8=S)\n\nTurn t_1+2: D  (a_9=D)\n\nThen Turn t_1+3: U  (a_10=U)\n\nTurn t_1+4: U  (a_11=U)\n\nTurn t_1+5: U  (a_12=U)\n\nTurn t_1+6: U  (a_13=U)\n\nTurn t_1+7: U  (a_14=U)\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=8, so t=0 to 7.\n\na_{t_1 +0} = a_7 = S\n\na_{t_1 +1} = a_8 = S\n\na_{t_1 +2} = a_9 = D\n\na_{t_1 +3} = a_10 = U\n\na_{t_1 +4} = a_11 = U\n\na_{t_1 +5} = a_12 = U\n\na_{t_1 +6} = a_13 = U\n\na_{t_1 +7} = a_14 = U\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H = 7+8=15, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is S)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}  (S)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 7: a_{t_1 +7}  (U)\n\nt_1 +7 =7+7=14, which is the last action.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=8, actions at offset t=0 to 7.\n\nIn the answer, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so it should be fine.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nIn the second sequence, I move up first, then down.\n\na7=U, a8=D, a9=D, then a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U.\n\na9=D to y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen same up.\n\nBut a9=D, whereas in first sequence a9=D also.\n\nIn first sequence a7=S, a8=S, a9=D.\n\nIn second, a7=U, a8=D, a9=D.\n\nThen a10 to a14 all U.\n\nNow, in both cases, from T=10 to T=15 same.\n\nBut the first one has more stay, but H same.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut in the second one, at T=8 I was at y=6, which is fine, and T=9 at y=5.\n\nNow, but let's see the coverage for row 6 at other times, but it was safe.\n\nSo both work.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with less down, but I think not.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 1-4 are safe at T=10, but I have to be on one, and y=4 is highest.\n\nBut to reach y=4 at T=10 with fewer actions or something, but not necessary.\n\nI think H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll pick one sequence.\n\nLet me write the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5,6,7 have two cars, but we considered, and freeway 8 has (36,25,right,12) which never covers 0, and the other same.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write with t_1.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: D\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nTo confirm, at turn t_1 + H -1 =7+8-1=14, action at turn 14, then position at T=15 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence above, after action at turn 14, y=9 at turn 15.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 8, with the sequence of actions detailed below.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn \\(t = 7\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), rows \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are all covered by cars, so the player must not be on any of these rows at this turn to avoid collision. Therefore, at turn \\(t = 10\\), the player must be on row \\(y = 4\\) (or lower, but \\(y = 4\\) is the highest safe row at this turn).\n- To achieve this, the player stays at \\(y = 5\\) for turns \\(t = 7\\) and \\(t = 8\\), then moves down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(t = 9\\) (reaching \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(t = 10\\)).\n- From turn \\(t = 10\\) onward, the player moves up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn \\(t = 15\\), as rows \\(5-8\\) are safe except at \\(t = 10\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are taken from turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 7 + 8 - 1 = 14\\), resulting in position \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H = 15\\).\n\n- **Turn \\(t_1\\) (Turn 7):** Action \\(S\\) (stay). Position at turn 8: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as row 5 is not covered at turn 8).\n- **Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\) (Turn 8):** Action \\(S\\) (stay). Position at turn 9: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as row 5 is not covered at turn 9).\n- **Turn \\(t_1 + 2\\) (Turn 9):** Action \\(D\\) (down). Position at turn 10: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as row 4 is not covered at turn 10).\n- **Turn \\(t_1 + 3\\) (Turn 10):** Action \\(U\\) (up). Position at turn 11: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as row 5 is not covered at turn 11).\n- **Turn \\(t_1 + 4\\) (Turn 11):** Action \\(U\\) (up). Position at turn 12: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as row 6 is not covered at turn 12).\n- **Turn \\(t_1 + 5\\) (Turn 12):** Action \\(U\\) (up). Position at turn 13: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as row 7 is not covered at turn 13).\n- **Turn \\(t_1 + 6\\) (Turn 13):** Action \\(U\\) (up). Position at turn 14: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as row 8 is not covered at turn 14).\n- **Turn \\(t_1 + 7\\) (Turn 14):** Action \\(U\\) (up). Position at turn 15: \\(y = 9\\) (reached safely).\n\nThis sequence avoids all car collisions, as verified against the car coverage times:\n- Rows 2, 3, 4 are covered at turns 8 and 9, but the player is on row 5 during these turns (safe).\n- Rows 5, 6, 7, 8 are covered only at turn 10, and the player is on row 4 at this turn (safe).\n- At all other times, the player is on safe rows or moving to safe positions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=8, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from t1.\n\nFirst, understand the player movement: at each turn, I can go up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nFor cars, they move left or right on their freeways. The collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new row until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe collision check is at the turn when I'm on that row. So for turn T, if I'm on freeway k, I check if any car on k has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t1=8, and for future turns T, I need to compute the span based on the direction and speed.\n\nList the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -39, tail -50, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-50 + 3(T-8), -39 + 3(T-8)]\n\nAt T=8, it should be [ -50 + 0, -39 +0] = [-50,-39], but the head and tail are given as (-39,-50), so for right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head is larger if it's to the right, but in coordinates, increasing x is right, so head should be larger x.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] -> span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says \"(-39, -50, right, 3)\"\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-50, -39]? But -50 to -39, that's from left to right, so head is -39, tail is -50, meaning the car is from x=-50 to x=-39.\n\nThen for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-50 + 3(T-8), -39 + 3(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (0, -11, right, 6) so at t1=8, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? Head is 0, tail is -11, so [ -11, 0] for t1.\n\nThen at T, [ -11 + 6(T-8), 0 + 6(T-8) ] = [6(T-8) -11, 6(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same as freeway 2: (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head 24, tail 13? For right-moving, span at t1 should be [τ, h] = [13,24]? But it says (24,13,right,12), so head=24, tail=13, so if right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so tail=13, head=24, so [13,24] at t1.\n\nBut in the notation, it says (head, tail), so for right, head is larger number.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at T, first car: [13 + 12(T-8), 24 + 12(T-8)]\n\nSecond car: [-35 + 12(T-8), -24 + 12(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 and 7, same as 5: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, so [37 + 12(T-8), 48 + 12(T-8)]\n\nSecond car: same as above, [-35 + 12(T-8), -24 + 12(T-8)]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on k at time T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at t=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut when I reach y=9, I'm done, so no collision there.\n\nNow, since I start at y=5, I need to move up to y=6,7,8, and then to 9.\n\nBut each move takes a turn, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, but in some cases it could to avoid a car, but let's see.\n\nSince I need to minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nSo let's see for each freeway, when is it safe to be on it, i.e., when 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nFirst, for freeway k=1: only one car, right-moving, span at T: [-50 + 3(T-8), -39 + 3(T-8)]\n\nSet 0 in span: -50 + 3(T-8) <= 0 <= -39 + 3(T-8)\n\nSo -50 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -39 + 3ΔT, where ΔT = T - 8\n\nLeft: -50 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 50 => ΔT <= 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so ΔT <= 16\n\nRight: 0 <= -39 + 3ΔT => 39 <= 3ΔT => ΔT >= 13\n\nSo 0 in span for ΔT from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nThus at T=8+13=21 to T=8+16=24, freeway 1 is unsafe.\n\nΔT min=13, T=21; ΔT max=16, T=24.\n\nFor other times, it's safe.\n\nBut since the car is moving right, and span is increasing, for ΔT <13, -39 +3ΔT <0 since ΔT<=12, -39+36=-3<0, and -50+3ΔT <= -50+36=-14<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nFor ΔT>16, -50+3ΔT >= -50+51=1>0? ΔT=17, -50+51=1>0, and -39+51=12>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, only T=21 to 24 unsafe for k=1.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (0,-11,right,6), at t1=8, span [ -11, 0 ]? Head=0, tail=-11, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at T=8.\n\nAt T, [ -11 + 6(ΔT), 0 + 6(ΔT) ] = [6ΔT -11, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 6ΔT -11 <= 0 <= 6ΔT\n\nLeft: 6ΔT -11 <= 0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nRight: 0 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >=0\n\nBut ΔT = T-8, so for T=8, ΔT=0, 6*0 -11 = -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1, T=9, [6*1 -11, 6*1] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔT=2, [12-11,12] = [1,12], 1<=0<=12? 1 <=0 is false, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=0: [ -11, 0], 0 is included? -11 <=0 <=0, since 0<=0 is true, and -11<=0 true, so 0 is in span.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=1: [-5,6], 0 in between.\n\nΔT=2: [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in span.\n\nΔT negative? But T>=t1, so no.\n\nSo freeway 2 unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8, it is unsafe now, but at turn t1=8, player is on y=5, not on k=2, so for k=2, unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut we care when player is on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (0,-11,right,6), so unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, so at T, [13 +12(ΔT), 24 +12(ΔT)]\n\nSet 0 in span: 13 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 24 +12ΔT\n\nBut 13 +12ΔT >=13 >0 for ΔT>=0, so left part 13+12ΔT <=0 is false, since min at ΔT=0 is 13>0, so never <=0. Thus 0 never in span for this car. Safe from this car.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, at T: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nLeft: -35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 24 <=12ΔT => ΔT >= 2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only ΔT=2, T=10.\n\nAt ΔT=2, [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nFor other ΔT, not.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at T=10.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same as 5, unsafe only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, at T: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT], min 37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12), same as before, unsafe at T=10, as above.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at T=10.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nk=1: unsafe T=21 to 24\n\nk=2: unsafe T=8,9\n\nk=3: unsafe T=8,9\n\nk=4: unsafe T=8,9\n\nk=5: unsafe T=10\n\nk=6: unsafe T=10\n\nk=7: unsafe T=10\n\nk=8: unsafe T=10\n\nPlayer starts at t=8, y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=5 is freeway 5.\n\nAt t=8, player is on y=5, which is freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 unsafe at t=8? From above, k=5 unsafe only at T=10, not at T=8. At T=8, for k=5, the cars: first car [13,24], not covering 0. Second car [-35,-24], not covering 0. So safe at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is safe at t=8.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe actions: at each turn, I choose to stay, up, or down, changing y for the next turn.\n\nLet t be the turn index, starting from t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be if I go up every turn, so from y=5 to y=9, that's 4 steps: up at t=8 to y=6, t=9 to y=7, t=10 to y=8, t=11 to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it's unsafe.\n\nNow, check for each step:\n\nFirst, at t=8, I'm on y=5 (freeway 5), which is safe, as above.\n\nThen I choose action at t=8: if I go up, at t=9 I will be on y=6.\n\nAction at t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), then I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t = k (freeway), and for that k, 0 in car span at time t.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, I must not have collision on that freeway at time T.\n\nIn the minimal path, I plan to go up at each turn.\n\nSo:\n\nAt t=8, y=5, freeway 5, safe as above.\n\nAction at t=8: if U, then y_{9} = 6\n\nAt t=9, I am on y=6, freeway 6.\n\nIs freeway 6 safe at t=9?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at T=10, but at t=9?\n\nFrom above, k=6 unsafe only at T=10, not at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=1, for k=6 cars: first car [13+12(1),24+12(1)]=[25,36], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], not cover 0. So safe at t=9.\n\nThen action at t=9: if U, y_{10} =7\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=10? Yes, from above, k=7 unsafe at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, for k=7, second car: [-35+12(2), -24+12(2)] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, so unsafe.\n\nIf I am on y=7 at t=10, I collide.\n\nBut in the plan, at t=10, I would be on y=7 if I went up from t=9.\n\ny_{10} =7, so at turn t=10, position y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=6 at t=9, which is safe, but then at t=10, if I go to y=7, I am on y=7 at t=10, collide.\n\nI could stay or go down, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince freeway 7 is unsafe only at t=10, I could be on it at other times.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nIn the direct path, t=10 is problem for y=7.\n\nNow, what about y=8 at t=10? If I could be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=10, I need to have been on y=7 at t=9, and go up at t=9 to y_{10}=8.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on y=7, but in the sequence, let's see.\n\nAt t=8, y=5.\n\nAfter action at t=8, y_{9} = ?\n\nIf I go up at t=8, y_{9}=6.\n\nThen at t=9, y=6, which is safe.\n\nNow at t=9, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up at t=9, y_{10}=7, then at t=10, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at t=9, y_{10}=6, then at t=10, I am on y=6.\n\nIs y=6 safe at t=10? Freeway 6 unsafe at t=10? From above, k=6 unsafe at T=10.\n\nYes, at t=10, for k=6, second car span [-11,0], 0 included, so unsafe to be on y=6 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down at t=9, y_{10}=5, then at t=10, on y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at t=10? k=5 unsafe at T=10, yes.\n\nSo at t=10, all freeways from 5 to 8 are unsafe? k=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at t=10.\n\nk=5 unsafe T=10, k=6 T=10, k=7 T=10, k=8 T=10.\n\nAnd k=1 to 4 unsafe only earlier, but at t=10, k=1 is safe, since unsafe 21-24.\n\nBut I need to be on some y between 1 and 8 to move, but at t=10, if I am on any of y=5,6,7,8, it is unsafe because all those freeways have collision at t=10.\n\ny=5 is k=5, y=6 k=6, etc., all unsafe at t=10.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, but at t=10, I might not be there.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nAt t=8, I am on y=5, safe.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeway 5,6,7,8 at t=10.\n\nSince all are unsafe at t=10.\n\nI could be on y=0 or y=9, but y=9 is goal, might not reach yet.\n\nOr I could be on a freeway that is safe at t=10, like k=1,2,3,4.\n\nk=1 is safe at t=10, since unsafe only later.\n\nk=2,3,4 unsafe at t=8,9, but at t=10? For k=2, unsafe at T=8,9, at T=10, ΔT=2, [6*2 -11, 12] = [12-11,12]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly k=3 and 4 same, safe at t=10.\n\nk=1 safe.\n\nSo at t=10, freeways 1,2,3,4 are safe, but 5,6,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=5 at t=8.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nSince at t=10, I cannot be on y=5,6,7,8, I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9 at t=10.\n\ny=9 would be good, but let's see if possible.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=8, in two turns, to where?\n\nAt t=8, after action, y_{9} = y8 + Δy8\n\ny8 is 5 at start of turn t=8.\n\nThen after action a8, y9 = 5 + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\ny10 must be such that if y10 between 1-8, it must not be unsafe at t=10, but t=10 is the time, so for position at t=10, y10 must be safe, meaning if 1<=y10<=8, then that freeway must be safe at t=10.\n\ny10 is the position at time t=10.\n\nAt time t=10, if 1<=y10<=8, then collision if freeway y10 has 0 in span at t=10.\n\nSo to avoid collision, either y10 <=0 or y10 >=9, or y10 between 1-8 but freeway safe at t=10.\n\ny10 <=0 or >=9 is safe, or y10=1,2,3,4 since freeways 1-4 safe at t=10.\n\nFreeways 5-8 unsafe at t=10.\n\nNow, from y=5 at t=8, in two moves, what y10 can I reach?\n\ny9 = 5 + a8 action: U: +1, D: -1, S:0\n\ny10 = y9 + a9 action\n\nSo y10 = (5 + a8) + a9\n\nSince a8 and a9 each in {U,D,S}, so Δy in {-1,0,1} each.\n\nSo y10 min: 5 + (-1) + (-1) = 3\n\nMax: 5 +1 +1 =7\n\nSo y10 can be from 3 to 7.\n\ny10=3,4,5,6,7\n\nNow, which of these are safe at t=10?\n\ny10=3: freeway 3, which is safe at t=10 (since k=3 unsafe only t=8,9)\n\ny10=4: freeway 4, safe at t=10\n\ny10=5: freeway 5, unsafe at t=10\n\ny10=6: freeway 6, unsafe\n\ny10=7: freeway 7, unsafe\n\nSo only y10=3 or 4 is safe.\n\ny10=3 or 4.\n\nBut y=3 or 4 is lower, and I need to go to y=9, so I have to go up later, which might take more turns.\n\nI could reach y=9 faster if I can avoid the collision.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=10, all middle freeways are unsafe, I could be on y=9 at t=10, but from above, y10 max 7 if I start from 5 in two moves, cannot reach 9.\n\ny=9 requires from 5, at least 4 moves up: to 6,7,8,9.\n\nMinimal turns to 9 is 4, but with collision at t=10 if I go directly.\n\nWith two moves from t=8, I can at best be at y=7 at t=10, which is unsafe.\n\nOr if I go down, to y=3 or 4 at t=10, safe but lower.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to 9.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=4 at t=10, then to y=9, need 5 more moves? From y=4 to y=9, 5 steps: to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut turns: let's list the turns.\n\nt=8: start y=5\n\nAction a8, then y9\n\na9, then y10\n\nIf I set y10=4, for example.\n\nThen from y10=4, I need to get to y=9.\n\nEach action increases turn.\n\nNow, I also need to consider future unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's set a path.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 are unsafe only at t=10, but safe at other times, I can be on them before or after t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, I must not be on them.\n\nSo one way is to be on y<=4 or y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable by t=10 from y=5.\n\ny<=4: so y=4,3,2,1,0.\n\nWith two moves down, y10=3 or 4 as above.\n\ny=2 or 1 or 0 also possible if I go down more, but y10 min=3 with two down? y9 =5 + D =4, then y10=4 + D=3, so y10=3.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=5, a9=D, y10=4.\n\nOr a8=D, y9=4, a9=S, y10=4.\n\nOr a8=D, y9=4, a9=D, y10=3.\n\nOr a8=S, y9=5, a9=S, y10=5, but y10=5 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations.\n\nSo safe y10: 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's take y10=4 for example.\n\nSo at t=10, y=4, freeway 4, safe at t=10.\n\nNow from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, need 5 moves up.\n\nBut I have to avoid other unsafe times.\n\nFirst, what about freeway 4? It is unsafe only at t=8 and t=9, not after, so for t>9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 same.\n\nFreeway 2 same, unsafe only t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe t=21-24, which is later, probably not issue if I move fast.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=10, I can go up each turn.\n\nBut I need to go through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, freeways 5,6,7,8 are unsafe only at t=10, so for t>10 or t<10, they are safe, except as per their cars.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: unsafe only t=10, so at t=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nk=5 unsafe only T=10, so for T=11, ΔT=3, first car [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], no 0; second car [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly k=6,7,8 same.\n\nk=1 has unsafe later, but I won't be on it if I go up.\n\nSo from t=10, y=4.\n\nI can go up at t=10 to y=5? Action at t=10 determines y_{11}.\n\nAt time t=10, I am at y=4.\n\nI choose a_{10}, which sets y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10} = 4 + Δy\n\nIf I go up, a_{10}=U, then y_{11}=5.\n\nThen at t=11, I am on y=5, freeway 5, which is safe as above.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to y=6 at t=12, and so on.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nStart: t=8, y=5\n\nTo have y_{10}=4.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: at t=8, go down? But y=5, go down to y=4? But freeway 4 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, I am on y=5, not on y=4.\n\nIf I choose a_{8}=D, then y_{9} = 5 -1 =4\n\nThen at t=9, I am on y=4.\n\nBut freeway 4 is unsafe at t=9? From above, k=4 unsafe at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, for k=4, car: same as k=2,3, at T=9, [6(1)-11, 6(1)] = [-5,6], 0 in span, so unsafe.\n\nIf I am on y=4 at t=9, I collide.\n\nBut in this case, if I go down at t=8, y_{9}=4, then at t=9, I am on y=4, which is unsafe at t=9. Collision.\n\nCannot go down at t=8 to y=4 at t=9, because at t=9, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down at t=8, I end up on y=4 at t=9, collide.\n\nIf I stay at t=8, a_{8}=S, y_{9}=5\n\nThen at t=9, on y=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 safe at t=9?\n\nk=5 unsafe only at t=10, not t=9.\n\nAt t=9, for k=5: first car [13+12(1),24+12(1)]=[25,36], no 0\n\nSecond car [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], no 0, so safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I am on y=5, safe.\n\nNow I need to set y_{10} to a safe position.\n\nIf I go down at t=9, a_{9}=D, then y_{10} = y_9 -1 =5-1=4\n\nThen at t=10, on y=4, freeway 4, which is safe at t=10, as [1,12] no 0.\n\nIf I go down to y=3, but y=4 is fine.\n\ny_{10}=4.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut I need to output actions from t=8.\n\nFirst, at t=8: I can do S or U, but not D, because if D, I go to y=4 at t=9 and collide.\n\nIf U, y_{9}=6, but at t=9, on y=6, which is safe, as earlier.\n\nBut then at t=10, if I go to y=7 or stay or down, all unsafe if on 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I need to be on safe at t=10.\n\nSo from t=9, y=5 or y=6.\n\nIf at t=9, y=5 (after S at t=8), then I can go down to y=4 at t=10.\n\nIf at t=9, y=6 (after U at t=8), then I can go down to y=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=10, or to y=6, unsafe, or to y=7, unsafe.\n\nOnly if I go down to y=5? y_{10}=5 if a_{9}=S from y=6, but unsafe.\n\nOr go down to y=5, same.\n\ny from 6, if go down, y_{10}=5, unsafe.\n\nIf stay, y_{10}=6, unsafe.\n\nIf up, y_{10}=7, unsafe.\n\nNo way to be safe at t=10 from y=6 at t=9.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go up at t=8, because it forces me to be on y=6 at t=9, and then at t=10, I must be on y=5,6, or7, all unsafe.\n\nIf I go down at t=8, I collide at t=9 on y=4.\n\nTherefore, the only choice at t=8 is to stay: a_{8}=S, so y_{9}=5, and at t=9, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I need to choose action to have safe y_{10}.\n\nIf I go down, a_{9}=D, y_{10}=4, which is safe at t=10.\n\nIf I stay, y_{10}=5, unsafe.\n\nIf up, y_{10}=6, unsafe.\n\nSo only down is possible to be safe at t=10.\n\nThus, a_{9}=D.\n\nThen y_{10}=4.\n\nAt t=10, on y=4, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, need 5 moves: U,U,U,U,U to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nAt t=10, y=4.\n\nAction at t=10: I can go up, to y_{11}=5.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs it safe? k=5 unsafe only at t=10, so at t=11, safe, as earlier.\n\nThen action at t=11: U, y_{12}=6\n\nAt t=12, on y=6, freeway 6, safe at t=12? k=6 unsafe only t=10, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=12: U, y_{13}=7\n\nAt t=13, on y=7, freeway 7, safe? Only unsafe t=10.\n\nt=13: U, y_{14}=8\n\nAt t=14, on y=8, freeway 8, safe? Only unsafe t=10.\n\nt=14: U, y_{15}=9\n\nAt t=15, on y=9, which is not freeway, so safe, and reached.\n\nNow, but I need to check if any other unsafe times, like for k=1, but I'm not on it.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=21-24, but I reach y=9 at t=15, before that.\n\nNow, how many turns: from t=8 to t=15, that's 8 actions? Let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn t: at start of turn, position y_t, then action a_t, then y_{t+1} set.\n\nReach when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nIn this case, at t=15, y=9.\n\nt from 8 to 15, that's 8 turns? t=8 to t=14 actions, then at t=15 position is 9.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t=8: position y=5\n\nAfter a8, y9 set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nWhen y_{t+1} =9, I reach at turn t+1.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=8: y8=5, a8=S, so y9=5\n\nt=9: y9=5, a9=D, so y10=4\n\nt=10: y10=4, a10=U, so y11=5\n\nt=11: y11=5, a11=U, so y12=6\n\nt=12: y12=6, a12=U, so y13=7\n\nt=13: y13=7, a13=U, so y14=8\n\nt=14: y14=8, a14=U, so y15=9\n\nNow, at t=15, y=9, reached.\n\nThe actions are from t=8 to t=14, that's 7 actions? t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nBut at which turn I reach? After a14 at t=14, y15=9, so at turn t=15, position is (0,9), but the turn when I first reach y=9 is t=15.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t=8 to t=14.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, I reach.\n\nHere, from t=8 to t=14, 7 actions, reach at t=15.\n\nMinimal H? But with no detour, minimal is 4, but not possible due to collision.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nBut from y=5, min 4 turns to y=9.\n\nBut at t=10, I have to avoid the unsafe freeways.\n\nSuppose at t=10, I am on y=4, as before.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps, from t=10 to t=15.\n\nTotal from t=8 to t=15, 8 turns? t=8 start, after 7 actions, at t=15.\n\nt=8: action, then t=9 position set, etc.\n\nTimeline:\n\n- At turn t=8: I am at y=5, choose a8\n\n- After a8, y9 set, and I move to that position for turn t=9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t=9: I am at y9, choose a9, set y10, and so on.\n\nWhen I am at turn t with y_t=9, I have reached.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=15, y=9.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=14 inclusive, that's 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nSuppose I go up at some point.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=10, freeways 5-8 unsafe, but I could be on y=8 before t=10 or after, but to reach y=9, I need to be on y=8 first.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 at t=9 or earlier.\n\nAt t=8, y=5, if I go up, y9=6\n\nThen at t=9, on y=6.\n\nIf I go up, y10=7, but at t=10 on y=7, unsafe.\n\nBut at t=9, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut I cannot go to y=7 at t=10.\n\nIf I go up twice quickly.\n\nt=8: U, y9=6\n\nt=9: U, y10=7 but unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nt=8: U, y9=6\n\nt=9: S, y10=6, but at t=10 on y=6, unsafe.\n\nt=9: D, y10=5, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo indeed, I need to be lower at t=10.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=9 directly from lower, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nAnother thought: at t=10, if I could be on y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is safe, but from y=5, I can go down to y=4 or 3 at t=10.\n\ny=0: to reach y=0 from y=5, I need to go down 5 times, which takes more turns, not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 too far.\n\nSo y=3 or 4 at t=10 is best.\n\nBut y=3: how to reach.\n\nWith a8=S, y9=5, then a9=D, y10=4, as before.\n\nIf a8=D, but earlier I saw if a8=D, y9=4, but at t=9, on y=4, which is unsafe, collide.\n\nSo cannot a8=D.\n\na8 must be S.\n\nThen a9 must be D to go to y10=4.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to minimize turns, after t=10, I go up as fast as possible.\n\nIn the sequence I have, from t=10 y=4, to t=11 y=5, t=12 y=6, t=13 y=7, t=14 y=8, t=15 y=9.\n\nThat's 5 moves from t=10 to t=14, reach at t=15.\n\nBut t=10 is after action a9? Let's list positions.\n\nt=8: y=5\n\na8=S, so y9=5\n\nt=9: y=5\n\na9=D, so y10=4\n\nt=10: y=4\n\na10=U, so y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5\n\na11=U, so y12=6\n\nt=12: y=6\n\na12=U, so y13=7\n\nt=13: y=7\n\na13=U, so y14=8\n\nt=14: y=8\n\na14=U, so y15=9\n\nt=15: y=9, done.\n\nActions: t=8: S, t=9: D, t=10: U, t=11: U, t=12: U, t=13: U, t=14: U\n\nThat's 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut I think I can save one turn.\n\nNotice that at t=11, I am on y=5, and I go up to y=6 at t=12, etc.\n\nBut freeways are safe after t=10, except for k=1 later, but not relevant.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, from t=10 y=4, if I go up multiple times, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=3 at t=10, but that would take more down, worse.\n\ny=4 is fine.\n\nAnother idea: at t=8, instead of staying, can I go up to y=6 at t=9, but then I have to deal with t=10.\n\nBut from y=6 at t=9, I need to be at safe y at t=10.\n\nBut y=6,5,7 all unsafe, and I cannot jump to y=4 in one step from y=6; if go down, y10=5, unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=4 at t=10 from y=6 at t=9, but going down: a9=D, y10=5, not 4.\n\nFrom y=6, down to y=5.\n\nCannot reach y=4 from y=6 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach y=3.\n\nSo impossible to be on safe y at t=10 if I go up at t=8.\n\nThus, only way is to stay at t=8 and go down at t=9 to y=4 at t=10.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the up phase, from t=10 to t=15, 5 turns to go from 4 to 9.\n\nBut I start from t=10 y=4, after 5 actions, at t=15 y=9.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=14.\n\nBut earlier actions t=8 and t=9.\n\nTotal actions t=8 to t=14, 7 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after t=10.\n\nNo, min 5 steps from 4 to 9.\n\nUnless I can skip some, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=10, I am on y=4, but instead of going directly up, but that would be slower.\n\nOr, I could have gone to y=3 at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=8: S, y9=5\n\nt=9: D, y10=4, as before.\n\nBut if at t=9, I go down twice? But I can only one action per turn.\n\na9=D, y10=4.\n\nTo get to y=3, I need to go down from y=4 at some point, but that would be extra.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo y=4 at t=10 is best.\n\nThen up to 9.\n\nBut let's confirm the freeways.\n\nAt t=13, I am on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt t=13, is it safe?\n\nΔT = t - t1 = t - 8, since t1=8.\n\nt=13, ΔT=5.\n\nFor freeway 7, cars: first car [13+12(5),24+12(5)]=[13+60,24+60]=[73,84], no 0\n\nSecond car [-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=14, y=8, freeway 8: first car [37+12(6),48+12(6)]=[37+72,48+72]=[109,120], no\n\nSecond car [-35+12(6), -24+12(6)]=[-35+72,-24+72]=[37,48], no 0, safe.\n\nAnd t=15, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about freeway 1? I never go there, so no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, k=1 unsafe at t=21,22,23,24, but I reach at t=15, fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nSuppose I go to y=3 at t=10.\n\nBut y=3 to y=9 needs 6 moves, worse.\n\nOr, can I be on y=9 at t=12 or something.\n\nFor example, if no cars, min from y=5 to y=9 is 4 turns: actions at t=8,9,10,11 to reach at t=12.\n\nBut with cars, not possible because of t=10 collision.\n\nTo reach at t=12: y12=9.\n\nThen y11 must be 8, since y12= y11 + a11, if a11=U, y12=9.\n\nSimilarly, y10 must be 7 or 8, etc.\n\nBut y12=9, so at t=12, on y=9.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=11, for example.\n\ny11=8.\n\nNow, at t=11, on y=8, freeway 8, safe? Yes, since unsafe only t=10.\n\nSimilarly, y10 must be such that y11=8, so if y10=7 or 8 or 9, but y9 to y10.\n\nStart from t=8 y=5.\n\nTo have y11=8.\n\ny11 = y10 + a10\n\ny10 = y9 + a9\n\ny9 = y8 + a8 =5 + a8\n\nSo y10 = 5 + a8 + a9\n\ny11 = 5 + a8 + a9 + a10\n\nSet y11=8.\n\nThen 5 + a8 + a9 + a10 =8, so a8 + a9 + a10 =3, since each Δy <=1, so must be U each, so a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nThen y9=6, y10=7, y11=8.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=6, safe.\n\nt=10, on y=7, but unsafe! At t=10, y=7 collide.\n\nThus impossible to have y11=8 with this, because y10=7 at t=10 collide.\n\nIf I have y10=8, then y11=8 or 9.\n\ny10=8: from above, y10=5 + a8 + a9\n\nSet to 8, so a8 + a9 =3, so both U, y9=6, y10=7? y10=5 + U + U =7? 5+1+1=7, not 8.\n\ny10=7 max from y=5 in two moves.\n\nCannot reach y=8 by t=10.\n\ny10 max=7, as earlier.\n\nAnd y=7 at t=10 unsafe.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=8 or y=9 by t=11 or earlier without being on unsafe spot.\n\nMinimal reach is t=12? y12=9.\n\nThen y11=8 or 9.\n\nIf y11=8, then y12=9.\n\ny11=8: how to reach.\n\ny11 =5 + a8 + a9 + a10\n\nSet to 8, so a8 + a9 + a10 =3, all U, then y9=6, y10=7, y11=8.\n\nBut at t=10, on y=7, unsafe, collide.\n\nIf y11=9, but y11=9 from y=5, need four U, but in three actions? a8,a9,a10: max y11=5+3=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny11 <= y8 +3 =8.\n\nSo y11=8 max.\n\nThus, to have y11=8, must be on y=7 at t=10, which collides.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach by t=11.\n\nNow t=12: y12=9.\n\nThen y11 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y11=8, then a11=U to y12=9.\n\ny11=8: as above, requires being on y=7 at t=10 or something.\n\ny11 =5 + a8 + a9 + a10 =8\n\nSo a8 + a9 + a10 =3, all U, so y10=7.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=7, collide.\n\nIf y11=9, impossible in three moves from 5.\n\nThus, cannot have y12=9 without being on unsafe position earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for t=13: y13=9.\n\nThen y12=8 or 9.\n\nIf y12=8, then a12=U to y13=9.\n\ny12=8: y12 =5 + a8 + a9 + a10 + a11\n\nSet to 8, so a8 + a9 + a10 + a11 =3.\n\nNot all U, since 4 actions, sum=3, so three U and one S, for example.\n\nBut need to avoid t=10 collision.\n\nNow, y12=8.\n\ny11 = y12 - a11, but depends.\n\nList the positions.\n\nt=8: y=5\n\nAfter a8: y9\n\nAfter a9: y10\n\nAfter a10: y11\n\nAfter a11: y12\n\ny12=8.\n\nSince y12 = y11 + a11, so if a11=U, y12= y11 +1, so y11=7\n\nIf a11=S, y12=y11, so y11=8\n\nIf a11=D, y12=y11-1, so y11=9, impossible.\n\nSo y11=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, y10 from y9 and a9, etc.\n\nNow, at t=10, y10 must be safe, not on 5,6,7,8.\n\nSo y10 <=4 or >=9, but >=9 impossible, so y10 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, y10 = y9 + a9\n\ny9 =5 + a8\n\na8 in U,D,S, so y9 in {4,5,6}\n\nThen y10 = y9 + a9\n\nIf y9=4, y10 can be 3,4,5\n\nIf y9=5, y10=4,5,6\n\nIf y9=6, y10=5,6,7\n\nNow, y10 <=4 for safety at t=10.\n\nCases:\n\n- If y9=4, then y10 can be 3 or 4 (if a9=D or S), or 5 (if U, but y10=5>4, unsafe)\n\nBut y10<=4 needed, so if y9=4, a9=D: y10=3, or a9=S: y10=4, both <=4 safe.\n\na9=U: y10=5, unsafe.\n\n- If y9=5, then y10=4 (a9=D), safe; y10=5 (S), unsafe; y10=6 (U), unsafe. So only a9=D, y10=4\n\n- If y9=6, then y10=5 (D), unsafe; y10=6 (S), unsafe; y10=7 (U), unsafe. All unsafe, so cannot have y9=6 if I want safe y10.\n\nTherefore, to have safe y10, I must have y9 <=5, and specifically:\n\n- If y9=4, then a9 can be S or D to have safe y10=4 or 3\n\n- If y9=5, then must a9=D to y10=4\n\n- Cannot have y9=6\n\nNow, back to reaching y12=8.\n\ny12=8, and y11=7 or 8.\n\nFirst, suppose y11=7.\n\nThen y12=8 with a11=U.\n\ny11=7: how to reach.\n\ny11 = y10 + a10\n\ny10 <=4, as above.\n\ny11=7.\n\nBut y10 <=4, and y11 = y10 + a10 <=4 +1=5, so y11<=5, cannot be 7.\n\nContradiction.\n\ny10 <=4, y11 = y10 + a10 <= 4+1=5 <7, impossible.\n\nIf y11=8.\n\nThen y12=8 with a11=S.\n\ny11=8.\n\ny11 = y10 + a10\n\ny10 <=4, so y11 <=5, cannot be 8.\n\nAlso impossible.\n\nThus, it is impossible to have y12=8 or y13=9 by t=12? y12=9 not possible since y11<=5, y12<=6.\n\ny12 max: from y10<=4, y11<=5, y12<=6.\n\nCannot reach y=8 or 9 by t=12.\n\nSimilarly, t=13: y13=9.\n\ny13=9, so y12 must be 8 or 9.\n\ny12 <=6 as above, so y12=8 or 9 impossible.\n\ny12 <=6, so y13 <=7.\n\nCannot reach by t=13.\n\nt=14: y14=9.\n\ny13 must be 8 or 9.\n\ny13: now y13 = y12 + a12\n\nBut y12 <=6, so y13 <=7, cannot be 8 or 9.\n\nStill impossible? Earlier I reached at t=15.\n\nIn my sequence, y14=8, y15=9.\n\ny14=8: how?\n\nIn my sequence, at t=14, y=8.\n\ny14=8.\n\nNow, y14 = y13 + a13\n\ny13=7 in my sequence.\n\ny13=7, which is possible since at t=13, no restriction.\n\nSimilarly, y12=6, etc.\n\nBut to reach earlier, suppose t=13: y13=9 not possible.\n\nt=14: y14=9 requires y13=8 or 9.\n\ny13: from y12 + a12.\n\ny12: in the context, after t=10, y10<=4, then y11<=5, y12<=6, y13<=7, y14<=8, so y14=8 max, y15=9.\n\nCannot reach before t=15.\n\nThus, minimal is to reach at t=15 with 7 actions.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I have actions from t=8 to t=14.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have a8=S, a9=D, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U.\n\nBut at t=9, I have a9=D, going down, but is there a problem?\n\nAt t=9, I am on y=5, freeway 5, which is safe at t=9, as established.\n\nThen I choose D, so y10=4.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nThen up to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after t=10.\n\nBut no, from 4 to 9, min 5 steps.\n\nAnother path: suppose at t=10, I am on y=4, but instead of going to y=5, I go directly, but I have to pass through.\n\nOr, can I reach y=9 in fewer steps by being on other rows, but no benefit.\n\nThus, this should be minimal H=7.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn count.\n\nStart at t=8, position (0,5)\n\nAfter 0 actions: at t=8\n\nAfter 1 action (t=8): position at t=9\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions: position at t=8+k\n\nReach when position y=9 at some t.\n\nIn this case, after 7 actions: actions at t=8 to t=14, position at t=15 is (0,9)\n\nH=7.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, i.e., t=8 to 14.\n\nActions: a8, a9, ..., a14.\n\nIn the output: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t=8: S\n\nt=9: D\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=10, I go U to y=5, which is fine.\n\nNow, but in the car states, I think I covered.\n\nFreeway 1 has later unsafe, but not on it.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list for each turn the position and if collision.\n\nt=8: y=5, freeway 5, cars: at t=8, ΔT=0, [13,24] and [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a8=S, so y9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, freeway 5, at t=9, ΔT=1, [13+12=25,24+12=36] and [-35+12=-23,-24+12=-12], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a9=D, so y10=4\n\nt=10: y=4, freeway 4, at t=10, ΔT=2, for k=4 car: [6*2 -11, 12] = [12-11,12]=[1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0, so safe.\n\nAction a10=U, so y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, freeway 5, at t=11, ΔT=3, [13+36=49,24+36=60] and [-35+36=1,-24+36=12], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a11=U, so y12=6\n\nt=12: y=6, freeway 6, at t=12, ΔT=4, [13+48=61,24+48=72] and [-35+48=13,-24+48=24], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a12=U, so y13=7\n\nt=13: y=7, freeway 7, at t=13, ΔT=5, [13+60=73,24+60=84] and [-35+60=25,-24+60=36], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a13=U, so y14=8\n\nt=14: y=8, freeway 8, at t=14, ΔT=6, for first car: [37+72=109,48+72=120], second car: [-35+72=37,-24+72=48], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a14=U, so y15=9\n\nt=15: y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=6?\n\nSuppose I reach at t=14.\n\ny14=9.\n\nThen y13 must be 8 or 9.\n\ny13: from y12 + a12\n\ny12 <=6 as before, since y10<=4, y11<=5, y12<=6.\n\ny13 = y12 + a12 <=6+1=7.\n\nSo y13<=7, cannot be 8 or 9.\n\nThus impossible to reach before t=15.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns starting from t1=8.\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nBut in the action, at turn 9, I go down, but that's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down by going to another row, but I think not necessary.\n\nAnother idea: at t=9, instead of going down, but I have to, to avoid t=10 on middle rows.\n\nSuppose I go to freeway 1 or 2, but lower, and go up from there, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=5 at t=9, if I go down to y=4 at t=10, same as before.\n\nOr to y=3, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, the sequence is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\), the player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at \\(t = 8\\) (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)), so staying (S) is chosen to remain at \\(y = 5\\) for turn \\(t = 9\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), the player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at \\(t = 9\\), but freeways 5-8 are unsafe at \\(t = 10\\). To avoid being on freeways 5-8 at \\(t = 10\\), moving down (D) is chosen to reach \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4) for turn \\(t = 10\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is safe at \\(t = 10\\) (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)), and moving up (U) is chosen to reach \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5) for turn \\(t = 11\\).\n- From turn \\(t = 11\\) to \\(t = 14\\), the player moves up (U) each turn to progress towards \\(y = 9\\):\n  - At \\(t = 11\\), from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 6\\).\n  - At \\(t = 12\\), from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 7\\).\n  - At \\(t = 13\\), from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n  - At \\(t = 14\\), from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 15\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nAll positions during the sequence are verified to be collision-free based on the car states and update rules. Freeways 5-8 are unsafe only at \\(t = 10\\), which is avoided by being on \\(y = 4\\) at that turn. Other freeways (e.g., freeway 1) have unsafe times later (e.g., \\(t = 21\\) to \\(24\\)), but the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) by \\(t = 15\\) before these times and does not use those freeways.\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t = 8\\) to \\(t = 14\\) (7 actions) achieves the goal at turn \\(t = 15\\) with minimal \\(H = 7\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\n The grid has freeways y=1 to y=8 (each row is a freeway). The player moves vertically: up (U, y+1), down (D, y-1), or stay (S, y same). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\n Collision occurs at turn T if the player is at some freeway y at that turn (meaning at the end of the turn, the player is on that freeway) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that same turn.\n\n Important note: When moving from freeway y to y+1 (by U) at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on freeway y (the starting freeway) and then at turn T+1 the player is on freeway y+1. Similarly for moving down.\n\n Therefore, when we are at position (0, y_t) at the beginning of turn t, we choose an action that will lead to y_{t+1}. Then at turn t (during the action) we are on freeway y_t, and at turn t+1 we are on freeway y_{t+1}. So the collision check at turn t is for freeway y_t.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" This means that at the exact turn T, the player is on freeway y_T and we check the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n Therefore, when we are at turn t (with current position y_t) and we choose an action, then during that turn we are still on freeway y_t. After the action, we move to y_{t+1} and then at the next turn we will be on freeway y_{t+1}.\n\n So the plan is to simulate from turn t1=9, starting at y=5, and we want to reach y=9 as quickly as possible without having any collision at any turn.\n\n We are given the car states at turn t1=9 for each freeway (k=1 to 8). The cars are moving at constant speed. We need to compute for any future turn T (>=9) the position of each car on its freeway.\n\n The car update:\n   Left-moving: span [h, τ] at turn t1 becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n   Right-moving: span [τ, h] at turn t1 becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n\n But note: the representation for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n   For right-moving: the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the update rule for right-moving says: \n        [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n   and for left-moving: \n        [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\n However, looking at the table, the direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\". In the provided data, all cars are \"right\". So we only use the right-moving update.\n\n But note: the representation in the table for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So at turn t1, the car spans from tail to head: [tail, head]. Then at turn T, the car spans [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\n However, in the table for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3). This is confusing because -36 is greater than -47. So if we consider the head as the front of the car (which is at -36) and tail at -47, then the car spans from -47 to -36? But for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost? Then at turn 9, the car is from -47 to -36? Then as time increases, the car moves right.\n\n But note: the update rule for right-moving says: \n        [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n   so if we take τ = tail = -47 and h = head = -36, then at time T, the span is [-47 + 3*(T-9), -36 + 3*(T-9)].\n\n Similarly, for freeway 2: (6, -5, right, 6) -> span at T: [-5 + 6*(T-9), 6 + 6*(T-9)]\n\n Now, we are only concerned when the player is on a freeway at a particular turn and if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\n We are to simulate from turn 9 (current turn) until we get to y=9. We are at y=5 at the beginning of turn 9.\n\n We are allowed to choose actions: U, D, S.\n\n We need to avoid collisions on every turn we are on a freeway (i.e., at turn T, if we are on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) then we must ensure that for every car on that freeway at turn T, 0 is not in the car's span.\n\n Note: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. How do we determine y_T?\n   - At the start of turn 9, we are at y=5. Then we choose an action for turn 9. After the action, we are at y_{10} (if we do U: then y10=6, D: y10=4, S: y10=5). But during turn 9, we are still on freeway 5. Then at the start of turn 10, we are at y10.\n\n So for collision at turn 9: we are on freeway 5 at turn 9. We must check the cars on freeway 5 at turn 9.\n\n Similarly, at turn 10: we will be on freeway y10 (the position we moved to at the end of turn 9).\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let t = 9, and y = 5.\n\n   We want to choose a sequence of actions until we get to y=9.\n\n   We must check for each turn t (starting at 9) until we reach the goal, that if at turn t we are on a freeway k (where k from 1 to 8) then 0 should not be in any car span on freeway k at turn t.\n\n   How to check for a freeway k at turn T?\n        For each car on freeway k (given at turn t1=9) with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n            if direction is right:\n                tail_T = tail + s*(T - 9)\n                head_T = head + s*(T - 9)\n                the span is [tail_T, head_T] (since the car moves right and the tail is left, head is right).\n            if direction is left (but in this problem all are right, so skip).\n\n        Then check if 0 is between tail_T and head_T (inclusive?).\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T)\". So if 0 is exactly at tail_T or head_T, that is a collision.\n\n   Important: the player is at x=0 always.\n\n We are to minimize the number of turns H (so the actions from turn 9 to turn 9+H-1, and at the end of turn 9+H-1 we are at y=9).\n\n Since we start at y=5 and we want to get to y=9, we must move up 4 times. However, we might have to wait (stay) to avoid collisions. Also, we might move down to avoid a collision and then up again? But that would take more steps. Since the goal is minimal H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\n However, we must check the freeways we step on: from y=5 to y=6 to y=7 to y=8 to y=9. But note that we are only on freeway 5,6,7,8 during the journey. We start at y=5 (freeway 5) at turn 9. Then we move to y=6 (so at turn 10 we are on freeway 6) and so on.\n\n But note: we can also stay on a freeway for multiple turns. However, the minimal H is at least 4 (if we do UUUU: then at turn 9: we are at y=5 -> at turn 10: y=6 -> turn 11: y=7 -> turn 12: y=8 -> turn 13: y=9. So H=5? because we have 5 turns: turn9, turn10, turn11, turn12, turn13? Actually, the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1. We start at turn9, and we take H actions to get to turn9+H. And at the beginning of turn9+H, we are at the new position. So we want at the beginning of turn9+H to be at y=9.\n\n How many actions to go from y=5 to y=9? We need 4 ups. So without waiting, we would have:\n   Turn9: U -> at turn10: y=6\n   Turn10: U -> at turn11: y=7\n   Turn11: U -> at turn12: y=8\n   Turn12: U -> at turn13: y=9\n\n Then we stop at turn13 (so we have taken 4 actions: turns9,10,11,12). Therefore H=4? But note the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. Then at the end of the last action (turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\n In this plan, at turn12 (which is t1+3, since t1=9, so t=3) we do the last action (U) and then at the next state (turn13) we are at (0,9). But the problem requires that we reach (0,9) at the end of the sequence? Actually, the player update: after action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1}. So at the end of turn12 (after the last action) we are at y=9. Then we are done.\n\n Therefore, we have H=4 actions: from turn9 to turn12.\n\n But note: we must check for collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. In this plan:\n\n   Turn9: we are at freeway5 (because we start at y=5 at turn9). Then we do U and then at turn10 we move to y=6. But during turn9, we are on freeway5.\n\n   Turn10: we are at freeway6 (at the start of turn10). Then we do U and move to y=7 at turn11. During turn10, we are on freeway6.\n\n   Turn11: freeway7.\n   Turn12: freeway8.\n\n   We are never on freeway9? because when we are at y=9, we are at the goal and we don't check? Actually, the freeways are only y=1 to 8. The goal is at y=9, which is not a freeway? So no car on y=9. Therefore, we only check freeways 5,6,7,8 at turns9,10,11,12 respectively.\n\n Now, we must check for each:\n\n   Freeway5 at turn9: \n        Cars: freeway5 has two cars: (36, 25, right, 12) and (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\n        For the first car: (36,25) -> wait, head=36, tail=25? But that would mean the car spans from 25 to 36? But the representation for right-moving: the update rule uses [τ, h] -> so we take τ = tail = 25? and head=36? Then at turn9 (T=9, so T-9=0): \n            span = [25, 36]? But 0 is not in [25,36]. \n        However, wait: the representation in the table is (head, tail). The first car is (36,25) meaning head=36, tail=25? But that would be a car of length 11? and at turn9, it is at [25,36]. Then 0 is not in that.\n\n        Second car: (-12, -23, right, 12): head=-12, tail=-23? so the car spans from -23 to -12? Then at turn9: [-23, -12]. 0 is not in this interval.\n\n        So freeway5 at turn9 is safe.\n\n   Freeway6 at turn10 (T=10, T-9=1):\n        Cars: same two cars? because freeway6 also has two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\n        First car: tail=25, head=36 -> at T=10: [25+12*1, 36+12*1] = [37,48] -> 0 not in there.\n        Second car: tail=-23, head=-12 -> [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0] -> now 0 is in [-11,0]? because -11<=0<=0.\n\n        Therefore, at turn10, if we are on freeway6, we would collide with the second car? because 0 is in the span.\n\n        So we cannot be on freeway6 at turn10.\n\n Therefore, the direct UUUU plan fails at turn10.\n\n We must avoid being on freeway6 at turn10.\n\n How? We can delay our arrival at freeway6. Alternatively, we might take a detour? But note that we are at freeway5 at turn9. We have three choices: U, D, S.\n\n If we do S at turn9: then we stay at y=5 for turn9 and then at turn10 we are still at y=5? Then we are on freeway5 at turn10? We must check freeway5 at turn10.\n\n   Freeway5 at turn10 (T=10):\n        First car: [25+12, 36+12] = [37,48] -> safe.\n        Second car: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? so collision.\n\n        So staying at freeway5 at turn10 is also unsafe.\n\n Then what about moving down? D at turn9: then at turn10 we are at y=4. But freeway4? We must check freeway4 at turn10.\n\n   Freeway4: has one car? Actually, the table only goes from freeway1 to 8. Freeway4 is not listed? Actually, the table:\n\n        Freeway1: one car\n        Freeway2: one car\n        Freeway3: one car\n        Freeway4: one car? The table says for freeway4: (6, -5, right, 6) -> same as freeway2 and 3? \n\n        Actually, the table:\n\n        | 1 | (-36, -47, right, 3) |\n        | 2 | (6, -5, right, 6) |\n        | 3 | (6, -5, right, 6) |\n        | 4 | (6, -5, right, 6) |\n        | 5 | (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12) |\n        | 6 | same as 5? Actually: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12) |\n        | 7 | same as 5? |\n        | 8 | (60,49,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12) |\n\n        So freeway4: one car: (6, -5, right, 6)\n\n        At turn10 (T=10, T-9=1): \n            tail = -5, head=6 -> becomes [-5+6*1, 6+6*1] = [1, 12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, moving down to freeway4 at turn10 is safe.\n\n        But note: we are at freeway5 at turn9 and we do D. Then at turn9 we are on freeway5? and we must check freeway5 at turn9 (which we did: safe). Then at turn10 we are on freeway4? and we check freeway4 at turn10: safe.\n\n        However, now we are at y=4. We need to get to y=9. So we have to go up 5 times. We have taken one turn and we are at y=4. Then we need at least 5 more ups -> total turns at least 6? But maybe we can do it in less by avoiding collisions.\n\n        But we are trying to minimize H. We want the minimal H. So maybe there is a way that avoids going down and then up again? \n\n        Alternatively, we might wait at freeway5 for one turn? But we saw that at turn10, freeway5 is unsafe. What about at turn11?\n\n        Freeway5 at turn11 (T=11, T-9=2):\n            First car: [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60] -> safe.\n            Second car: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway5 is safe at turn11.\n\n        Therefore, if we do S at turn9 and then S at turn10? Then at turn9: we are on freeway5 (safe). At turn10: we are still on freeway5? and we do S -> then we are still at freeway5 at turn10? and we must check freeway5 at turn10: which we saw is unsafe (because of the second car: [-11,0]). So that is not an option.\n\n        What if we do S at turn9? then we are at freeway5 at turn9 (safe) and then at turn10 we are at freeway5 (unsafe). So we cannot do S at turn9.\n\n        So the only safe action at turn9 is D? Then we go to freeway4 at turn10.\n\n        Then at turn10, we are at freeway4. We need to go to freeway9. What next?\n\n        We can try to go up at turn10: then we go to freeway5 at turn11. We must check:\n\n            Freeway4 at turn10: we already did: safe.\n            Then at turn10, we do U -> then at turn11 we are at freeway5.\n\n            Now, check freeway5 at turn11: we just did: safe.\n\n        Then at turn11: we are at freeway5 (safe). Then we can do U to go to freeway6 at turn12.\n\n            Check freeway6 at turn12 (T=12, T-9=3):\n                Freeway6 has two cars: \n                    First: (36,25,right,12): [25+12*3, 36+12*3] = [25+36, 36+36] = [61,72] -> safe.\n                    Second: (-12,-23,right,12): [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn12 we do U -> freeway7 at turn13.\n\n            Check freeway7 at turn13 (T=13, T-9=4):\n                Freeway7: same two cars? \n                    First: [25+48, 36+48] = [73,84] -> safe.\n                    Second: [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn13: U -> freeway8 at turn14.\n\n            Check freeway8 at turn14 (T=14, T-9=5):\n                Freeway8: two cars: \n                    (60,49,right,12): [49+12*5, 60+12*5] = [49+60, 60+60] = [109,120] -> safe.\n                    (-12,-23,right,12): [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn14: U -> freeway9 at turn15. And we are done.\n\n        So the sequence: \n            turn9: D  (from y=5 to y=4 at turn10)\n            turn10: U (y=4->5 at turn11)\n            turn11: U (5->6 at turn12)\n            turn12: U (6->7 at turn13)\n            turn13: U (7->8 at turn14)\n            turn14: U (8->9 at turn15)\n\n        Total actions: 6 (from turn9 to turn14, H=6).\n\n        But is there a faster way? We saw that the direct 4-step plan fails at turn10. Maybe we can wait one turn at a safe freeway? But we saw freeway5 at turn10 is unsafe. \n\n        What if we try to go to freeway6 at a later turn? For example, we wait at freeway5 until it is safe? But we saw that freeway5 is safe at turn11. So:\n\n            turn9: S -> then we are still at freeway5 at turn10? -> unsafe? because at turn10, freeway5 is unsafe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can go up at turn9 to freeway6 at a time when freeway6 is safe? We saw freeway6 at turn10 is unsafe. What about freeway6 at turn11? \n\n            Freeway6 at turn11 (T=11, T-9=2):\n                First car: [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60] -> safe.\n                Second car: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n            So freeway6 is safe at turn11.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            turn9: U -> then at turn10 we are at freeway6? -> unsafe (because at turn10, freeway6 is unsafe).\n\n            But wait: at turn9 we are at freeway5 (safe). We do U at turn9 -> then at turn10 we are at freeway6? and we must check freeway6 at turn10: unsafe.\n\n            So we cannot do U at turn9 to go to freeway6 at turn10.\n\n        However, what if we do something else at turn9? We already saw that S and U lead to unsafe at turn10? and D is safe but then we go down.\n\n        Another idea: go up at turn9 to freeway6 at turn10? but we know that freeway6 at turn10 is unsafe. So we must avoid that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            turn9: D (to freeway4 at turn10) -> safe at turn10 (freeway4).\n            Then at turn10: we can go up to freeway5 at turn11 -> safe (freeway5 at turn11 is safe).\n            Then at turn11: we go up to freeway6 at turn12 -> safe (freeway6 at turn12: we already computed for turn12? actually we computed for turn12 in the previous plan and it was safe? but that was for freeway6 at turn12? and we did that at turn12 in the previous plan. Now we are at turn12? Let me compute freeway6 at turn12 (T=12, T-9=3): \n                First car: [25+36, 36+36] = [61,72] -> safe.\n                Second car: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn12: U to freeway7 at turn13 -> check freeway7 at turn13 (T=13, T-9=4): \n                First car: [25+48,36+48] = [73,84] -> safe.\n                Second car: [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn13: U to freeway8 at turn14 -> freeway8 at turn14: we computed: safe.\n            Then at turn14: U to freeway9.\n\n        That is 6 actions: same as before.\n\n        But note: we could try to go faster after turn11. We are at freeway5 at turn11. Then we want to go to freeway6 at turn12, then freeway7 at turn13, freeway8 at turn14, freeway9 at turn15: that's 4 actions from turn11 to turn14? but we already used 2 actions (turn9: D, turn10: U) so total 6.\n\n        Alternatively, from freeway5 at turn11, we might do two ups in a row? But that doesn't save: we still need to go to 6,7,8,9 -> 4 steps.\n\n        What if we skip one? We can't because we can only move one step at a time.\n\n        Is there a way to get to freeway6 at turn11 without going down? \n\n        We are at freeway5 at turn9. If we do nothing at turn9, we are at freeway5 at turn10 (unsafe). So we must leave freeway5 at turn9. The only safe move is down to freeway4 at turn10.\n\n        Then at turn10 we are at freeway4. We can then go up to freeway5 at turn11 (safe). Then at turn11 we are at freeway5. Then we can go to freeway6 at turn12 (safe). Then freeway7 at turn13, freeway8 at turn14, freeway9 at turn15.\n\n        That is 6 actions.\n\n        But wait: what if we go up twice in a row from freeway4? \n\n            At turn10: we are at freeway4. We do U: go to freeway5 at turn11 (safe). \n            Then at turn11: we do U: go to freeway6 at turn12 (safe).\n\n        That is the same.\n\n        What if we do U at turn10 and then at turn11 we do U again? That's what we did.\n\n        So minimal H is 6? But let me check if we can do it in 5.\n\n        We need to be at freeway9 at the end of the 5th action? That is at turn14 (because turn9: action0, turn10: action1, turn11: action2, turn12: action3, turn13: action4 -> then at turn14 we are at the new position). We start at y=5 at turn9. We need to go up 4 steps. But we have 5 actions? Then we can do 4 ups and one extra action. The extra action must be a stay or a down? \n\n        Consider:\n\n            Option1: \n                turn9: U -> to freeway6 at turn10 -> unsafe at turn10 (freeway6).\n\n            Option2:\n                turn9: D -> to freeway4 at turn10 (safe).\n                turn10: U -> to freeway5 at turn11 (safe).\n                turn11: U -> to freeway6 at turn12 (safe).\n                turn12: U -> to freeway7 at turn13 (safe).\n                turn13: U -> to freeway8 at turn14 (safe) -> but we are at freeway8 at turn14, not freeway9.\n\n            Then we need one more U to get to freeway9 at turn15.\n\n            So that's 6.\n\n        What if at turn13 we are at freeway8? we do U at turn13 to go to freeway9 at turn14? Then we are at freeway9 at turn14? and that is the goal. But we are at freeway8 at turn13? How did we get to freeway8 at turn13? \n\n            We started at turn9: D -> at turn10: freeway4.\n            turn10: U -> turn11: freeway5.\n            turn11: U -> turn12: freeway6.\n            turn12: U -> turn13: freeway7? \n            then turn13: U -> turn14: freeway8? \n\n            We are at freeway8 at turn14? and we want to be at freeway9 at the end of the sequence? so we need one more U at turn14 to get to freeway9 at turn15.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to do:\n\n            turn9: D -> freeway4 at turn10.\n            turn10: U -> freeway5 at turn11.\n            turn11: U -> freeway6 at turn12.\n            turn12: U -> freeway7 at turn13.\n            turn13: U -> freeway8 at turn14. \n            turn14: U -> freeway9 at turn15.\n\n            That is 6 actions.\n\n        How to do in 5? We need to be at freeway9 at the end of the 5th action (turn13: action4 -> then at turn14 we are at freeway9). So we must have moved from freeway5 to freeway9 in 4 actions? That requires 4 ups. So we must do 4 ups and one other action. The other action must be a down or a stay. But we started at freeway5 and we did a down at turn9. Then we are at freeway4. Then we do 4 ups: \n            freeway4 -> freeway5 -> freeway6 -> freeway7 -> freeway8.\n            Then we are at freeway8 at the end of the 4th up? which is after the 5th action? \n\n            Specifically:\n                turn9: D -> freeway4 at turn10.\n                turn10: U -> freeway5 at turn11.\n                turn11: U -> freeway6 at turn12.\n                turn12: U -> freeway7 at turn13.\n                turn13: U -> freeway8 at turn14.\n\n            Then we are at freeway8 at turn14, not freeway9.\n\n        So we need a 6th action to get to freeway9.\n\n        What if we do two downs? \n\n            turn9: D -> freeway4 at turn10.\n            turn10: D -> freeway3 at turn11.\n\n            Then we are at freeway3 at turn11? Check freeway3 at turn11 (T=11, T-9=2):\n                Freeway3: one car: (6,-5,right,6) -> at T=11: [-5+6*2, 6+6*2] = [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\n            Then we have to go up 6 steps? That would take even longer.\n\n        Alternatively, we might try to go up at turn9? even though freeway6 at turn10 is unsafe? but we can't because it is unsafe.\n\n        Another idea: what if we do U at turn9 to freeway6 at turn10? but then we are unsafe. But note: the problem says that we are on freeway6 at turn10 and we check the cars at turn10. The car on freeway6 at turn10 has a span that includes 0? so we die.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\n        But wait: is there a way to get to freeway9 in 5 turns? \n\n        We start at y=5 at turn9. We do 5 actions. The net displacement must be +4 (to get to 9). So the sum of the moves must be +4. Each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0. So we need the number of U minus the number of D = 4. Let u be the number of U, d the number of D, s the number of S. Then u - d = 4, and u+d+s=5. Then:\n\n            u = 4 + d\n            then 4+d + d + s = 5 -> 4 + 2d + s = 5 -> 2d+s=1.\n\n            So d can be 0 and s=1 -> then u=4. That is: 4 ups and one stay.\n\n            Or d=1 and s=-1 -> impossible. So the only possibility is 4 ups and 1 stay.\n\n        So we must have one stay and four ups. The stay can be at any turn.\n\n        Let me try:\n\n            Option: stay at turn9: then at turn10 we are still at freeway5? and we must check freeway5 at turn10: unsafe -> so that fails.\n\n            Option: stay at turn10: so we do:\n                turn9: U -> to freeway6 at turn10 -> unsafe at turn10 -> fails.\n\n            Option: stay at turn11: \n                turn9: U -> unsafe at turn10 -> fails.\n\n            Option: stay at turn12: \n                turn9: U -> unsafe at turn10 -> fails.\n\n            Option: stay at turn13: \n                turn9: U -> unsafe at turn10 -> fails.\n\n        So the 5-action plan fails.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 6.\n\n        We have a 6-action plan: D, U, U, U, U, U.\n\n        But wait: we do D at turn9, then U at turn10, then U at turn11, U at turn12, U at turn13, and then U at turn14? Then we are at freeway9 at turn15? That is 6 actions and we are at freeway9 after the 6th action? So the last action is at turn14? and we are done at turn14? \n\n        Actually, the sequence:\n\n            Start at turn9: y=5.\n            turn9: D -> then at turn10: y=4 (freeway4) -> safe at turn10 (freeway4).\n            turn10: U -> then at turn11: y=5 (freeway5) -> safe at turn11 (freeway5).\n            turn11: U -> then at turn12: y=6 (freeway6) -> safe at turn12 (freeway6).\n            turn12: U -> then at turn13: y=7 (freeway7) -> safe at turn13 (freeway7).\n            turn13: U -> then at turn14: y=8 (freeway8) -> safe at turn14 (freeway8).\n            turn14: U -> then at turn15: y=9 -> goal.\n\n        But note: we are required to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence? The last action is at turn14, and after that we are at y=9. So we do 6 actions: from turn9 to turn14.\n\n        So the sequence:\n\n            Turn 9: D\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: U\n            Turn13: U\n            Turn14: U\n\n        But wait: we only need to be at y=9 at the end of the sequence. The problem does not require that we are at freeway9 at a particular turn? so yes.\n\n        However, we must check the last action: at turn14 we are at freeway8? and we do U -> then we are at freeway9 at turn15. But we are not on freeway9 during the sequence? we are only on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 during the actions. And we checked those. The goal freeway9 is not a freeway with cars? so no check.\n\n        Therefore, the plan is safe.\n\n        But note: we must also check that we don't go out of bounds? The player update: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. In this plan:\n\n            turn9: from 5 to 4 -> safe.\n            turn10: 4 to 5 -> safe.\n            turn11: 5 to 6 -> safe.\n            turn12: 6 to 7 -> safe.\n            turn13: 7 to 8 -> safe.\n            turn14: 8 to 9 -> safe.\n\n        So it is within bounds.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            Turn 9: D\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: U\n            Turn13: U\n            Turn14: U\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" for the first action. Here t1=9.\n\n        So:\n\n            Turn 9: D\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n\n        H=6.\n\n        However, let me double-check the freeway8 at turn14? \n\n            Freeway8 at turn14 (T=14, T-9=5): \n                Cars: \n                    (60,49,right,12): [49+12*5, 60+12*5] = [49+60, 60+60] = [109,120] -> safe.\n                    (-12,-23,right,12): [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n        So safe.\n\n        And freeway7 at turn13: \n            (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12) at T=13 (T-9=4):\n                [25+48, 36+48] = [73,84] -> safe.\n                [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n        freeway6 at turn12: [61,72] and [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        freeway5 at turn11: [49,60] and [1,12] -> safe? 0 is not in [49,60] or [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        freeway4 at turn10: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        freeway5 at turn9: [25,36] and [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n        All safe.\n\n        But note: what about the other freeways? We have freeway1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But we are only on freeways 5,4,5,6,7,8? \n\n        Specifically:\n            turn9: freeway5 -> safe.\n            turn10: freeway4 -> safe.\n            turn11: freeway5 -> safe.\n            turn12: freeway6 -> safe.\n            turn13: freeway7 -> safe.\n            turn14: freeway8 -> safe.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        However, wait: the freeway4 at turn10: we have one car: (6,-5,right,6) -> at T=10: [-5+6, 6+6] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        Yes.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 6, and the sequence is as above.\n\n        But is there a 5-action sequence? We argued that the only 5-action sequence must have 4 ups and 1 stay. We tried and we couldn't because the stay must be at a safe moment? and we found that either the move to freeway6 at turn10 is unsafe or staying at freeway5 at turn10 is unsafe. \n\n        However, what if we do:\n\n            turn9: U -> freeway6 at turn10: unsafe? but what if we do a stay at turn10? then we are at freeway6 at turn10? and we must check freeway6 at turn10: which is unsafe. So we cannot.\n\n        What if we do:\n\n            turn9: S -> then we are at freeway5 at turn10: unsafe -> so we die.\n\n        So no 5-action plan.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the 6-action plan.\n\n        However, note that the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=6.\n\n        Let me see if we can do it in 6 with a different sequence? but we have one that works.\n\n        But wait: we could avoid the down and then up? by waiting at freeway5 until it is safe? we saw that freeway5 is safe at turn9 and turn11, but not at turn10. So if we could skip turn10? We can't because we are at freeway5 at turn9 and if we do nothing we are at freeway5 at turn10 (unsafe). \n\n        What if we do:\n\n            turn9: D -> freeway4 at turn10 (safe).\n            turn10: U -> freeway5 at turn11 (safe).\n            Then we have to do 4 more ups: to 6,7,8,9. That's 6 actions.\n\n        Or:\n\n            turn9: D -> freeway4 at turn10 (safe).\n            turn10: U -> freeway5 at turn11 (safe).\n            turn11: S -> freeway5 at turn12? Check freeway5 at turn12 (T=12, T-9=3): \n                First car: [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] -> safe.\n                Second car: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] -> safe.\n            Then turn12: U -> freeway6 at turn13: check freeway6 at turn13 (T=13, T-9=4): \n                [25+48,36+48]=[73,84] and [-23+48,-12+48]=[25,36] -> safe.\n            turn13: U -> freeway7 at turn14: safe.\n            turn14: U -> freeway8 at turn15: then we do U at turn15 to get to freeway9 at turn16? then we have 7 actions.\n\n        That is worse.\n\n        So the original 6-action plan is minimal.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 9: D\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n\n        But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\". Here H=6, so t from 0 to 5.\n\n        t=0: turn9 -> D\n        t=1: turn10 -> U\n        t=2: turn11 -> U\n        t=3: turn12 -> U\n        t=4: turn13 -> U\n        t=5: turn14 -> U\n\n        So:\n\n            Turn 9: D\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n\n        Now, let me write the answer in the boxed format.\n\n        \\boxed{\n            Turn 9: D\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n        }\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\" etc. So:\n\n            Turn 9: D\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the initial turn is t1=9, and the player is at (0,5). After the action at turn9 (D), we are at (0,4) at the beginning of turn10. Then after turn10 (U) we are at (0,5) at turn11, and so on.\n\n        We reach (0,9) at the beginning of turn15? But the problem says we must reach (0,9) at the end of the last action? The last action is at turn14, and after that we are at (0,9). So at the beginning of turn15 we are at (0,9), but we don't take an action at turn15. We stop after the 6th action.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n        Let me check if there is a shorter way that I missed? \n\n        What if we go up at turn9 to freeway6 at turn10? and then at turn10 we do D? That would be:\n\n            turn9: U -> freeway6 at turn10: unsafe? so we collide at turn10.\n\n        Similarly, any sequence that goes to freeway6 at turn10 is unsafe.\n\n        What if we go to freeway5 at turn9, then at turn9 we do U? that leads to freeway6 at turn10 -> unsafe.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal is 6.\n\n        We are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 6, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn 9, starting at \\(y = 5\\), moving down (D) avoids collision on freeway 5 at turn 9 and moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, on freeway 4, moving up (U) avoids collision (car span at turn 10 is \\([1, 12]\\), not containing 0) and moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, on freeway 5, moving up (U) avoids collision (car spans at turn 11 are \\([49, 60]\\) and \\([1, 12]\\), not containing 0) and moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, on freeway 6, moving up (U) avoids collision (car spans at turn 12 are \\([61, 72]\\) and \\([13, 24]\\), not containing 0) and moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, on freeway 7, moving up (U) avoids collision (car spans at turn 13 are \\([73, 84]\\) and \\([25, 36]\\), not containing 0) and moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, on freeway 8, moving up (U) avoids collision (car spans at turn 14 are \\([109, 120]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\), not containing 0) and moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 6 turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars defined with their positions, directions, and speeds. I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car occupies position x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new y-position, at turn T, you are only on y_T for that turn, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=10.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-33, -44, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-44, -33] at t_1=10. Direction is right, so head is at h, tail at τ, and since right-moving, the span is [τ, h], so from -44 to -33.\n\nAt time T, the span becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here seem to be right-moving based on the data.\n\nLet me confirm the directions: all say \"right\" except for freeway 1, it says \"right\", freeway 2,3,4 \"right\", 5,6,7,8 all \"right\". Freeway 8 has two cars, both \"right\". So all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving, since it moves right.\n\nIn the update rule: right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would be [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], but no left-moving here.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, there exists a car such that 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for some car on that freeway.\n\nt_1 is 10, so T - t_1 is the offset.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1, so for turn T, Δt = T - 10.\n\nSpan for a car: [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt] for right-moving.\n\n0 is in this interval if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSince τ ≤ h for right-moving? In the span, for right-moving, head is larger than tail, I think, because it's moving right.\n\nIn the initial state, for freeway 1: head h=-33, tail τ=-44, so h > τ, so span [τ, h] = [-44, -33].\n\nAfter moving, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], so since s>0, it increases.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nNow, 0 is in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSo for collision on freeway k at time T, if for some car on k, τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt, where Δt = T - 10.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe start at y=4, turn 10.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be small, but we have to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each possible turn, when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut since the player moves vertically, and cars horizontally, we need to know for each y and each time, if (0,y) is occupied.\n\nBut the occupation depends on the cars on that freeway at that time.\n\nSo let's list for each freeway k from 1 to 8, the cars and when they occupy x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: τ = -44, h = -33, s=3, right-moving.\n\nSet Δt = T - 10.\n\nSpan at T: [ -44 + 3Δt, -33 + 3Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -44 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -33 + 3Δt\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-44 + 3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 44 => Δt ≤ 44/3 ≈ 14.666, so Δt ≤ 14 since integer? Δt is integer, T integer, so Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -33 + 3Δt => 3Δt ≥ 33 => Δt ≥ 11\n\nSo for Δt from 11 to 14 inclusive, 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nΔt = 11: low = -44 + 33 = -11, high = -33 + 33 = 0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, so occupied.\n\nΔt=12: low= -44+36= -8, high= -33+36=3, [ -8,3], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=13: low= -44+39= -5, high= -33+39=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=14: low= -44+42= -2, high= -33+42=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔt=15: low= -44+45=1, high= -33+45=12, [1,12], 0 not in since 0<1.\n\nΔt=10: low= -44+30= -14, high= -33+30= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at Δt=11,12,13,14, i.e., turns T=21,22,23,24.\n\nT = t_1 + Δt = 10 + Δt.\n\nSo T=21,22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: (12,1,right,6)\n\nh=12, τ=1? Let's see: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" so for freeway 2: (12,1,right,6)\n\nSo head=12, tail=1, so span at t_1: [1,12] I think, since right-moving.\n\n[τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [1 + 6 Δt, 12 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 6Δt\n\nBut 1 + 6Δt ≥ 1 > 0 for Δt ≥ 0, so left inequality 1 + 6Δt ≤ 0 is impossible since 1+6Δt ≥1 >0. So 0 never in span? But 0 ≤ 12 + 6Δt always true for Δt ≥0, but the lower bound is positive, so 0 < lower bound, not in interval.\n\nFor example, Δt=0: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=1: [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nAlways, since min is at least 1, so freeway 2 is never occupied at x=0? But let's confirm.\n\nThe car is at [1,12] at t_1, moving right with speed 6, so it starts from x=1 to 12, moving away from 0, so indeed, for t≥t_1, it will be to the right, so x=0 never occupied on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (12,1,right,6)\" identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: also \"(12,1,right,6)\" same.\n\nSo freeways 2,3,4 have no car that occupies x=0 at any time, since the car is always to the right.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\nLower bound 37+12Δt ≥37 >0, so 0 never in this interval.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), so h=0, τ=-11, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 12 Δt is always true for Δt ≥0.\n\n-11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/12 <1, so for Δt=0, it holds? Δt=0: [-11,0], so -11 ≤0≤0, 0 is included? 0≤0 is true, so yes.\n\n0 ≤ 12 Δt: for Δt=0, 0≤0 true.\n\n-11 +12(0) = -11 ≤0, true.\n\nSo at Δt=0, [ -11, 0 ], 0 is in.\n\nBut Δt=0 is turn T= t_1=10.\n\nNow, for Δt=1: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=0 only.\n\nBut this is for freeway 5 at turn T.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\nFirst, for freeway 5, second car at Δt=0: occupied.\n\nBut we need to know for each turn.\n\nΔt=0: T=10, occupied by second car.\n\nFirst car never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 5 occupied only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? \"6 | (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\" identical.\n\nSo also occupied only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 7: same, \"(48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\", so occupied only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 8: \"(-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\"\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12 Δt\n\nFirst, -59 +12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt ≤ 4\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -48 +12 Δt => 12 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo Δt=4: low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: low= -59+36= -23, high= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only Δt=4, T=10+4=14.\n\nNow second car on freeway 8: (0,-11,right,12), same as before.\n\nh=0, τ=-11, s=12.\n\nSpan: [-11 +12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\n0 in if -11 +12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nAs before, for Δt=0: [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor Δt=1: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=10, occupied.\n\nBut freeway 8 has two cars, so if either occupies x=0, it's occupied.\n\nAt T=10, both might occupy, but for second car at Δt=0.\n\nAt T=10, Δt=0.\n\nFirst car at T=14, as above.\n\nBut for occupancy, we care if at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nSo for freeway 8:\n\nAt T=10: second car has span [-11,0], so 0 in, occupied.\n\nAlso, first car at T=10: span [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=14: first car has span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSecond car at T=14: span [-11+48, 48]? Δt=4 for T=14, since T=10+4.\n\nSecond car: at Δt=4, span [-11 + 12*4, 12*4] = [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at T=10 and T=14.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=21,22,23,24 (from earlier, Δt=11,12,13,14)\n\nFreeway 2: never occupied\n\nFreeway 3: never\n\nFreeway 4: never\n\nFreeway 5: occupied only at T=10 (from second car)\n\nFreeway 6: occupied only at T=10\n\nFreeway 7: occupied only at T=10\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=10 and T=14\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=10, position y=4.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on freeway y_T, and if that freeway has x=0 occupied at T, then collision.\n\nNote that freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, always safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, at turn 10, player is on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4? Freeway k corresponds to row y=k, I think.\n\nIn the problem, freeways y=1,...,8, so freeway k is at height y=k.\n\nSo for position (0,y), if y between 1 and 8, it's on freeway y.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T, if 1≤ y_T ≤8, then we need to check if freeway y_T is occupied at T.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, at turn 10, y=4, and freeway 4 is occupied? Freeway 4: from above, freeway 4 is never occupied, since it has a car at [12,1] or something, but earlier we said freeway 2,3,4 never occupied.\n\nFreeway 4: car (12,1,right,6), which is always right of 1, so x=0 never occupied. Yes.\n\nBut at turn 10, for freeway 4, it's not occupied, so player is safe at turn 10.\n\nBut freeway 5,6,7,8 are occupied at T=10, but player is on y=4, which is freeway 4, not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we can move up, we can go directly up.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on occupied freeways at the wrong times.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path: from y=4 to y=9, we need to increase y by 5, so at least 5 moves up, but we can also stay or move down, but to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we might need to wait to avoid collisions.\n\nSince some freeways are occupied at certain times.\n\nList the dangerous times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: occupied T=21,22,23,24\n\nFreeway 5,6,7: occupied only at T=10, but T=10 is current turn, and player is not on them, so for future, T>10, not occupied except as below.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 occupied only at T=10, so for T>10, they are safe.\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=10 and T=14.\n\nT=10 is past or current? At T=10, player is on y=4, not 8, so safe.\n\nT=14, freeway 8 occupied.\n\nOtherwise, freeways 2,3,4 always safe.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied at T=21-24.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4, turn 10.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, S keeps, D decreases.\n\nSince we need to go up, D might not be useful unless to avoid something, but let's see.\n\nThe minimal H: if we go up every turn, we can reach in 5 turns: from y=4 to y=5,6,7,8,9 in 5 steps.\n\nStart turn 10: y=4\n\nAfter action at turn 10, we move to turn 11.\n\nTurn-based: at turn t, we are at position, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions, and after H turns, we are at y_{t_1 + H} or something.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nTurn t_1 =10: player is at (0, y_{10}) = (0,4)\n\nThen we choose action a_{10}, which determines y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy, with Δy based on a_{10}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, we choose a_{11}, and so on, up to some turn when we reach y=9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe reach y=9 at some turn, say T_final.\n\nThen H is the number of actions, so from turn 10 to turn T_final, there are (T_final - 10) actions, I think.\n\nStart: turn 10, position set.\n\nAfter action a_{10}, at turn 11, position y_{11}.\n\nAfter a_{11}, at turn 12, y_{12}, and so on.\n\nSo after k actions, we are at turn 10 + k.\n\nAnd y_{10 + k} should be 9 for some k.\n\nH is the minimal k such that y_{10 + k} = 9.\n\nAnd we need the sequence of actions from a_{10} to a_{10 + H -1}, I think.\n\nIn the answer format: actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to the turn before we reach.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t_1, then at t_1+1, y=9.\n\nBut here y starts at 4, to 9, need 5 steps up, so H at least 5.\n\nIf we do U every turn, from y=4, after one U, y=5 at turn 11; after two U, y=6 at turn 12; ... after five U, y=9 at turn 15.\n\nTurn 10: y=4\n\nAction a_{10}: U, then turn 11: y=5\n\na_{11}: U, turn 12: y=6\n\na_{12}: U, turn 13: y=7\n\na_{13}: U, turn 14: y=8\n\na_{14}: U, turn 15: y=9\n\nSo at turn 15, y=9, reached.\n\nH=5 actions: from a_{10} to a_{14}.\n\nNow, we need to check if during this path, we collide with any car.\n\nThat is, for each turn from 10 to 14, when we are on a freeway, is it occupied.\n\nTurn 10: y=4, freeway 4, which is never occupied, so safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=5, freeway 5. Freeway 5 is occupied only at T=10, but T=11>10, so not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 12: y=6, freeway 6, occupied only at T=10, not at 12, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=7, freeway 7, occupied only at T=10, not at 13, safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=8, freeway 8. Freeway 8 is occupied at T=10 and T=14.\n\nAt T=14, it is occupied, and we are on y=8 at turn 14, so collision!\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt turn 14, y=8, freeway 8 occupied, so we would collide.\n\nTherefore, this path has collision at turn 14.\n\nWe cannot be on freeway 8 at turn 14.\n\nNow, we need to avoid that.\n\nPossible ways: either not be on y=8 at turn 14, or be there but at a time when not occupied.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied only at T=10 and T=14, so other times safe.\n\nBut T=10 is past, so for T=14 occupied, T=15 not, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to pass through y=8 or go directly, but we move one step at a time.\n\ny=8 must be visited at some point.\n\nWe can be on y=8 at turn not 14.\n\nFor example, earlier or later.\n\nBut we start from y=4, turn 10.\n\nIf we go up slower, or faster, or stay, or move down.\n\nFirst, the direct path has issue at turn 14.\n\nSince freeway 8 is safe except at T=14, we can be on y=8 at another time.\n\nFor instance, at turn 13 or turn 15, etc.\n\nBut at turn 13, if we are at y=8, but let's see the sequence.\n\nWe need to minimize H, so we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nWith H=5, we reach turn 15, but on the way, at turn 14 we are on y=8 which is occupied.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? With H=5, we reach at turn 15, but the collision is at turn 14.\n\nCan we reach earlier? From y=4 to y=9 in fewer than 5 moves? No, because each move changes y by at most 1, so from 4 to 9, need at least 5 up moves. If we do S or D, it takes more moves, so minimal H is 5, but with collision, so we need H>5 or different sequence.\n\nWith H=5, we must do 5 U moves, no other choice, since any S or D would require more moves to reach y=9.\n\nTo go from 4 to 9, net +5, each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0, so to have net +5, we need number of U minus number of D to be 5, and H = number of U + number of D + number of S.\n\nSince number of U = number of D + 5, let N_U, N_D, N_S.\n\nThen y_final = y_start + N_U - N_D = 4 + N_U - N_D =9, so N_U - N_D =5.\n\nAnd H = N_U + N_D + N_S.\n\nMinimal H when N_D=0 and N_S=0, so H=5.\n\nBut with H=5, N_U=5, N_D=0, N_S=0, but we have collision at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, we need to take more turns, with some S or D to avoid the collision.\n\nNow, the collision is only at turn 14 on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 is safe except at T=14.\n\nOther freeways: freeway 1 has issues later, but we might not reach there if we go fast.\n\nSince we go to y=9, which is above, freeway 1 is y=1, we don't need to go there.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=4,5,6,7,8 from turn 10 to 14.\n\ny=8 at turn 14 is bad.\n\nWe can be on y=8 at a different turn.\n\nFor example, if we delay being on y=8.\n\nOr advance.\n\nBut advancing: to be on y=8 earlier.\n\nTurn 10: y=4\n\nIf we could be at y=8 earlier, but from y=4, to y=8, need 4 moves, so at turn 14, y=8 is the earliest? Turn 10: y=4, after 4 U, at turn 14 y=8.\n\nTurn 10: start, after action, turn 11 y=5, turn 12 y=6, turn 13 y=7, turn 14 y=8. So y=8 at turn 14 is the earliest possible.\n\nWe cannot be at y=8 before turn 14.\n\nLater, yes, if we stay or move down.\n\nBut to reach y=9 later.\n\nNow, freeway 8 is occupied only at T=14, so if we are on y=8 at T=13 or T=15, it should be safe.\n\nBut T=13: if we are on y=8 at turn 13, but from y=4, how to reach y=8 by turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: after 3 actions from turn 10.\n\nAfter 3 actions: if all U, at turn 13 y=7, not 8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 13, we need to start from y=4, and after 3 actions, be at y=8.\n\nBut each action changes y by at most 1, so from y=4, after 3 actions, max y=7, min y=1, so impossible to be at y=8 at turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, turn 12: after 2 actions, y between 2 and 6, not 8.\n\nTurn 11: after one action, y=3,4, or 5.\n\nSo the earliest to be at y=8 is turn 14, as before.\n\nAnd at turn 14, it is occupied, so we cannot be on y=8 at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y=8 at turn 14.\n\nSince we must pass through y=8 at some point, we have to be there at a different turn, but since turn 14 is the only possible time we can be there early? No, we can be later.\n\nFor example, at turn 15 or later.\n\nBut at turn 15, if we are at y=8, but we want to reach y=9 at turn 15, but y=8 at turn 15 might be possible, but let's see.\n\nFirst, to avoid being on y=8 at turn 14.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 14, we should not be on y=8.\n\nSince we are going up, at turn 14, we could be on y=7 or y=9 or something.\n\nBut from previous.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, freeway 8 is the only one with a problem at T=14, others are fine except freeway 1 later, but we might not care if we go fast.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied at T=21-24, but if we reach y=9 by turn 15, we are done before that, so no issue.\n\nSo only problem is freeway 8 at T=14.\n\nWe need to ensure that at turn 14, we are not on y=8.\n\nPossible positions at turn 14: since we start from y=4 at turn 10, after 4 actions, y at turn 14 can be from 0 to 8, but since we go to 9, we want to be as high as possible.\n\nBut specifically, we don't want y=8 at turn 14.\n\nSo we can be at y=7, or y=9? But to be at y=9 at turn 14, we need to reach in 4 actions, but from y=4 to y=9 in 4 actions: min y=0, max y=8, so y=9 impossible at turn 14. Max is 8.\n\nSo at turn 14, y can be at most 8.\n\nSimilarly, min 0.\n\nSo possible y at turn 14: 0 to 8.\n\nWe need y not 8 at turn 14.\n\nThen we can be at y=7, for example.\n\nThen from there, go to y=8 and y=9 later.\n\nBut that will take more turns.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid y=8 at turn 14.\n\nSo, from turn 10 to turn 13, we can go up, but at turn 14, we should not be at y=8.\n\nSo, for example, at turn 13, we should not be at y=7, because if at turn 13 y=7, and we go U, then turn 14 y=8, which is bad.\n\nIf at turn 13 y=6, and go U, turn 14 y=7.\n\nOr if at turn 13 y=7, and go S, turn 14 y=7.\n\nOr go D, turn 14 y=6.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nAlso, at turn 13, we might be on freeway, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart turn 10: y=4\n\nWe need to choose actions.\n\nTo reach quickly, we should go up, but avoid being on y=8 at turn 14.\n\nSo, one way: by turn 13, be at y=6 or less, so that at turn 14, after action, y=7 or less, not 8.\n\nBut then from there, we need to go to y=9, which takes more moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose at turn 13, we are at y=6.\n\nThen at turn 14, we can go to y=7.\n\nThen turn 15, to y=8.\n\nBut at turn 15, y=8, is freeway 8 occupied? Freeway 8 occupied at T=10 and T=14, not at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, freeway 8: from earlier, only occupied at T=10 and T=14, so at T=15, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen turn 16 to y=9.\n\nBut we reached at turn 16, with H=6 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from turn 10 to 15: 6 actions to reach at turn 16.\n\nH=6, since after 6 actions, at turn 16 y=9.\n\nBut earlier with H=5 we could not, so H=6 might be minimal now.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 8 is safe at turn 15, if we can be at y=8 at turn 15.\n\nBut at turn 15, if we are at y=8, then to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut same as above.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 15.\n\nFrom start, turn 10 y=4.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at turn 15 y= something.\n\nIf we do actions to have y=8 at turn 15.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at some point.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, y=9 is possible if we go up fast.\n\nBut from y=4, to y=9 in 5 actions: with 5 U, at turn 15 y=9.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 14 we are at y=8, which is occupied, as before.\n\nBut if we do only 4 U and one S, for example, then at turn 15 y=8 or less, not 9.\n\nLet's list possible.\n\nWe need N_U - N_D =5.\n\nFor minimal H, set N_D=0, then N_U=5, H = N_U + N_S =5 + N_S.\n\nIf N_S=0, H=5, but collision.\n\nSo we need at least one S or D.\n\nIf N_D=0, H=5 + N_S.\n\nWith N_S=1, H=6.\n\nSimilarly, if N_D=1, then N_U=6, since N_U - N_D=5, so H = N_U + N_D + N_S =6 +1 + N_S if N_D=1, N_U=6, H=7 + N_S, worse than with N_D=0.\n\nSimilarly, if N_D=2, N_U=7, H larger.\n\nSo minimal H with no collision is H=6 with N_U=5, N_S=1, N_D=0.\n\nOr with N_U=6, N_D=1, but H larger.\n\nSo best to have one stay.\n\nNow, we need to place the stay so that at turn 14, we are not on y=8.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 14, we should be at y=7 or less.\n\nSince we start at y=4 turn 10.\n\nAfter actions: let t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn 10: y=4\n\nWe need to choose a_t for t=10,11,12,13,14, and at turn 15 y=9 for H=6? After 6 actions, turn 16.\n\nSet the actions.\n\nWe have to do 5 U and one S.\n\nThe S can be at different times.\n\nNow, the position at turn 14 must not be y=8.\n\nTurn 14 position depends on previous actions.\n\nTurn 14 is after 4 actions from turn 10.\n\nAfter 4 actions, y_{14} = 4 + number of U minus number of D in first 4 actions.\n\nSince N_D=0, y_{14} = 4 + number of U in first 4 actions.\n\nWe want y_{14} != 8.\n\nSince max y_{14} with 4 U is 8, min 4 with 4 S, but with actions.\n\ny_{14} = 4 + U_count in a_{10} to a_{13}, since action at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn 10: position y=4\n\nChoose a_{10}, then y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}\n\nSimilarly, a_{11}, y_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11}, and so on.\n\nSo at turn T, y_T.\n\nFor turn 14, y_{14}, which is after actions a_{10} to a_{13}, since a_{13} determines y_{14}.\n\ny_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13}\n\nBut y_{13} depends on previous.\n\nThe value y_{14} depends on actions from a_{10} to a_{13}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{14} = 4 + sum_{t=10}^{13} Δy_t\n\nΔy_t = +1 if U, 0 if S, -1 if D.\n\nSince we have 5 U in total, but for the first four actions, we have some U, S, or D.\n\nBut N_D=0, so only U or S.\n\ny_{14} = 4 + (number of U in a_{10} to a_{13}) + (number of S in a_{10} to a_{13}) * 0, but S doesn't change, so y_{14} = 4 + U_count_{10-13}\n\nU_count_{10-13} is the number of U actions from t=10 to 13, which is 0 to 4.\n\nThus y_{14} = 4 + U_count_{10-13}, between 4 and 8.\n\nWe want y_{14} != 8, so U_count_{10-13} != 4, so less than 4, so U_count_{10-13} <=3, so y_{14} <=7.\n\nThus, we must have at most 3 U in the first four actions (t=10 to 13).\n\nSince we need 5 U in total, and H=6 actions (from t=10 to 15? Actions: a_{10} to a_{15}, 6 actions, to reach at turn 16 y=9.\n\nAfter 6 actions, turn 16.\n\nWe have 6 actions: 5 U and 1 S.\n\nThe actions are at t=10,11,12,13,14,15.\n\nNow, for y_{14}, which is determined by actions up to a_{13}.\n\ny_{14} = 4 + sum_{t=10}^{13} Δy_t\n\nAs above, y_{14} = 4 + U_count_{10-13}\n\nWe need y_{14} <=7, so U_count_{10-13} <=3.\n\nSince we have 5 U in total, and 6 actions, with one S.\n\nThe S can be in the first four actions or in the last two.\n\nIf S is in a_{10} to a_{13}, then U_count_{10-13} <=3, which is fine for y_{14}<=7.\n\nIf S is in a_{14} or a_{15}, then in a_{10} to a_{13}, we have 4 actions, all must be U? But we have only 5 U, but actions 10-13: if all U, then U_count=4, y_{14}=8, which we don't want.\n\nIf S is not in 10-13, then since one S, it must be in 14 or 15, so actions 10-13 are all U or some, but we have 5 U for all, so if actions 10-13 are all U, that's 4 U, then y_{14}=4+4=8, which is bad.\n\nIf we have a D, but we set N_D=0, so only U and S.\n\nTherefore, to avoid y_{14}=8, we must have the S in the first four actions, so that U_count_{10-13} <=3.\n\nThus, one of a_{10} to a_{13} must be S, and the others U, so that U_count_{10-13} <=3.\n\nThen y_{14} <=7.\n\nThen at turn 14, y <=7, not 8, so no collision.\n\nThen we can proceed to go up to y=9.\n\nNow, we need to check if at other turns, we are safe.\n\nFirst, let's list the freeway occupations again.\n\nDangerous times:\n\n- Freeway 5,6,7: occupied only at T=10, not later.\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at T=10 and T=14.\n\n- Freeway 1: occupied at T=21-24, but if we reach by turn 16, before 21, so no issue.\n\n- Freeway 2,3,4: never occupied.\n\nIn the sequence, we will be on y=5,6,7,8 at some points.\n\nNow, with the stay in the first four actions.\n\nFor example, suppose we do S at turn 10.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = S, then y_{11} = y_{10} + 0 = 4 (since S)\n\nAction at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: start y=4\n\na_{10} = S, then turn 11: y=4\n\na_{11} = U, turn 12: y=5\n\na_{12} = U, turn 13: y=6\n\na_{13} = U, turn 14: y=7  (since y_{13}=6, a_{13}=U, y_{14}=7)\n\nNow, at turn 14, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied only at T=10, not at 14, so safe.\n\nThen a_{14} = U, turn 15: y=8\n\nNow, turn 15: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nIs freeway 8 occupied at T=15? No, only at 10 and 14, so at 15, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen a_{15} = U, turn 16: y=9, reached.\n\nH=6 actions: a_{10} to a_{15}.\n\nNow, check all turns:\n\nTurn 10: y=4, freeway 4, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=4, still? After a_{10}=S, y_{11}=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=5, freeway 5. T=12, freeway 5 occupied only at T=10, not 12, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=6, freeway 6, occupied only at T=10, not 13, safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=7, freeway 7, occupied only at T=10, not 14, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=8, freeway 8, T=15, not occupied (only at 10 and 14), safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nWe used one S at turn 10.\n\nBut we can place the S at other times in the first four actions.\n\nFor example, S at turn 11.\n\na_{10} = U, turn 11: y=5\n\na_{11} = S, turn 12: y=5\n\na_{12} = U, turn 13: y=6\n\na_{13} = U, turn 14: y=7\n\nThen a_{14} = U, turn 15: y=8\n\na_{15} = U, turn 16: y=9\n\nNow, turns:\n\nTurn 10: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=5, freeway 5, T=11, not occupied (only at 10), safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=5, freeway 5, T=12, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=6, freeway 6, T=13, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=7, freeway 7, T=14, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=8, freeway 8, T=15, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, S at turn 12.\n\na_{10} = U, turn 11: y=5\n\na_{11} = U, turn 12: y=6\n\na_{12} = S, turn 13: y=6\n\na_{13} = U, turn 14: y=7\n\na_{14} = U, turn 15: y=8\n\na_{15} = U, turn 16: y=9\n\nTurns:\n\nTurn 10: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=5, T=11, freeway 5 safe\n\nTurn 12: y=6, T=12, freeway 6 safe\n\nTurn 13: y=6, T=13, freeway 6? y=6, freeway 6, T=13, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=7, freeway 7, T=14, safe\n\nTurn 15: y=8, freeway 8, T=15, safe\n\nGood.\n\nS at turn 13.\n\na_{10} = U, turn 11: y=5\n\na_{11} = U, turn 12: y=6\n\na_{12} = U, turn 13: y=7\n\na_{13} = S, turn 14: y=7  (since S)\n\nThen a_{14} = U, turn 15: y=8\n\na_{15} = U, turn 16: y=9\n\nTurns:\n\nTurn 10: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 12: y=6, safe\n\nTurn 13: y=7, freeway 7, T=13, not occupied, safe\n\nTurn 14: y=7, freeway 7, T=14, not occupied, safe\n\nTurn 15: y=8, freeway 8, T=15, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nIn all cases, H=6.\n\nBut can we reach earlier with H=5? We saw that with H=5, we must be at y=8 at turn 14, which is occupied, so impossible. So H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for turns starting from t_1=10.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nFor H=6, actions from turn 10 to 15.\n\nWe can choose any of the above sequences.\n\nFor example, with S at turn 10:\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut after a_{15}=U, at turn 16 y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions up to a_{15}, and after that, at turn 16, we reach.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so for H=6, t=0 to 5, corresponding to turns t_1 + t = 10 + t, so turns 10,11,12,13,14,15.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut at turn 15 action U, then position at turn 16 is (0,9).\n\nSimilarly, with S at other points.\n\nBut all are fine.\n\nTo make it faster in a way, but since we have to stay once, it's the same.\n\nAnother sequence: we could go up immediately but stay later, but in terms of time, we reach at turn 16 in all cases.\n\nIs there a way to reach at turn 15? With H=5 actions, but we saw not possible without collision.\n\nPerhaps by moving down, but that would take more actions, worse.\n\nFor example, if we move down to avoid something, but no need.\n\nFreeway 1 is occupied later, but we don't go there.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence above, with S at turn 10, we stay at y=4 for two turns: turn 10 and 11.\n\nTurn 10: after a_{10}=S, y_{11}=4.\n\nThen from turn 11 to 12: a_{11}=U, y_{12}=5, etc.\n\nBut we can have S later to be higher faster, but since we have to delay y=8, it might not help.\n\nFor example, with S at turn 13: we are at y=7 at turn 13 and 14, then to y=8 at 15, y=9 at 16.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAll sequences with one S and five U, with the S in the first four actions, will work.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the car states, I think I covered all.\n\nBut freeway 8 has another car, but I think I considered.\n\nIn the beginning, for freeway 5,6,7, at T=10 occupied, but since player is not on them at T=10, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are on them later, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 not an issue.\n\nSo, one possible sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut turn 14 action U, from y=7 to y=8 at turn 15? Let's list positions:\n\nTurn 10: y=4\n\na10=S → turn 11: y=4\n\na11=U → turn 12: y=5\n\na12=U → turn 13: y=6\n\na13=U → turn 14: y=7\n\na14=U → turn 15: y=8\n\na15=U → turn 16: y=9\n\nYes.\n\nWith S at turn 11:\n\nTurn 10: U → turn 11: y=5\n\na11=S → turn 12: y=5\n\na12=U → turn 13: y=6\n\na13=U → turn 14: y=7\n\na14=U → turn 15: y=8\n\na15=U → turn 16: y=9\n\nIn this case, at turn 14 y=7, which is freeway 7, safe.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, we can choose any.\n\nBut perhaps to minimize something, but H is the same.\n\nSince the player might want to be higher, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: in the sequence with S at turn 10, we stay at y=4, which is safe, but we could have gone up earlier.\n\nFor example, with S at turn 13, we are at y=7 at turn 13 and 14, which is closer to goal.\n\nBut not required.\n\nI think any sequence is acceptable.\n\nLet me write one.\n\nAlso, in the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nNow, t_1=10.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut H=6 actions, from turn 10 to 15.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car for freeway 7 at turn 14.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 14, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt T=14, Δt=4.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12*4, 48 + 12*4] = [37+48,48+48]= [85,96], not at 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 12*4, 12*4] = [-11+48,48] = [37,48], not at 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 15, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCars: first car (-48,-59,right,12) at Δt=5 (T=15, t1=10, Δt=5)\n\nSpan: [-59 + 12*5, -48 + 12*5] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 12*5, 12*5] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60], not at 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other turns.\n\nTherefore, this works.\n\nTo have fewer lines, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with H=5 if we go to y=9 directly but avoid y=8 at turn 14, but impossible since must be at y=8 at turn 14 with H=5.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nI think we can output the sequence.\n\nIn the format.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at turn 15, and after that, at turn 16, position is (0,9).\n\nSince the player reaches at turn 16, but the actions are up to turn 15.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother sequence with S later, but same H.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, we do S, staying at y=4, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps we can do U immediately but S at another time.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 10: U → turn 11: y=5\n\nTurn 11: S → turn 12: y=5\n\nTurn 12: U → turn 13: y=6\n\nTurn 13: U → turn 14: y=7\n\nTurn 14: U → turn 15: y=8\n\nTurn 15: U → turn 16: y=9\n\nSame thing.\n\nIn this, at turn 11, y=5, which is freeway 5, but at T=11, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think both are acceptable.\n\nI'll go with the first one for simplicity.\n\nBut in the first, we stay at start.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must increase their \\(y\\)-position from 4 to 9, requiring a net change of +5. Each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, so at least 5 \"U\" actions are necessary.\n- With 5 \"U\" actions and no other actions, the player would reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15 (after actions from turn 10 to 14). However, this path results in a collision at turn 14 when \\(y = 8\\), as freeway 8 is occupied at turn 14.\n- Freeway 8 is occupied only at turns 10 and 14, so being on \\(y = 8\\) at any other turn (e.g., turn 15) is safe.\n- To avoid being on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14, an additional action is needed. The minimal solution uses 5 \"U\" actions and 1 \"S\" (stay) action, resulting in \\(H = 6\\) actions, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n- The \"S\" action must occur in one of the first four actions (turns 10 to 13) to ensure \\(y \\leq 7\\) at turn 14, avoiding the collision on freeway 8.\n- All other freeways (1 to 7) are either never occupied at relevant times or safe when the player is on them in this sequence, as verified below.\n\n### Safe Sequence with \\(H = 6\\):\nOne valid sequence is to use \"S\" at turn 10, followed by \"U\" for all subsequent actions. This ensures:\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, not occupied at turn 14).\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, not occupied at turn 15).\n- Reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n\n#### Position and Collision Check:\n| Turn | Action | \\(y\\) Position | Freeway | Occupied at Turn? | Collision? |\n|------|--------|----------------|---------|-------------------|-----------|\n| 10   | S      | 4              | 4       | No (never)        | No        |\n| 11   | U      | 4 → 5          | 5       | Only at turn 10   | No        |\n| 12   | U      | 5 → 6          | 6       | Only at turn 10   | No        |\n| 13   | U      | 6 → 7          | 7       | Only at turn 10   | No        |\n| 14   | U      | 7 → 8          | 7       | Only at turn 10   | No        |\n| 15   | U      | 8 → 9          | 8       | Only at turns 10 and 14 | No (turn 15 safe) |\n| 16   | -      | 9              | -       | -                 | Goal reached |\n\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Never occupied (car at [12,1] moving right, always x>1).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Occupied only at turn 10 (car [0,-11] at turn 10), safe at turn 11.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Occupied only at turn 10, safe at turn 12.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Occupied only at turn 10, safe at turns 13 and 14.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Occupied at turns 10 and 14; at turn 15, cars are at [1,12] and [49,60] (not at x=0), so safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 6\\)) with no collisions.\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 11, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes the x-coordinate 0 (which is the player's x).\n\nImportant: The player is on a freeway y at turn T if they are at that y at the start of the turn? Actually, note the update: at turn T, the player's position is (0, y_T). Then we check for collision at turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAlso note: the car movement is continuous. For a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s, then at turn T (>=t1), the span becomes:\n\nFor left-moving (which we don't have in this problem? all are right?): \n  Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the cars given are all right-moving? Let me check:\n\nAll cars are labeled \"right\", so for right-moving:\n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (right end) and tail is the left end? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3). So at t1=11, the car is at [tau, h] = [-41, -30]? But the table says (head, tail) = (-30, -41). So we must interpret: the given tuple is (head, tail) and for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-41, -30].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (60,49,right,12) -> span at t1: [49,60]? But wait, the table says \"Cars\" and for freeway 5 there are two: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12). So for the first car: head=60, tail=49 -> so the car is from 49 to 60 (so at t1, it is [49,60] and moving right at speed 12 per turn).\n\nBut note: the update for right-moving: \n  At T: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for the first car on freeway 5: \n  tau = 49, head = 60, s=12.\n  At T: [49 + 12*(T-11), 60 + 12*(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly, the second car: head=12, tail=1 -> so at t1: [1,12]. Then at T: [1+12*(T-11), 12+12*(T-11)].\n\nNow, collision at turn T on freeway k if the player is on freeway k at turn T (i.e., y_T = k) and the car's span at turn T contains 0.\n\nBut note: the player is at x=0. So we require that 0 is in the interval [A, B] for the car at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 11, and we are at y=4. We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid freeways 1 to 8 when there is a car that has 0 in its span at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nImportant: when we move, we are on a freeway at turn T if we are at that freeway at the start of the turn? Actually, the position at turn T is (0, y_T). Then we update to y_{T+1} = y_T + action. And at the moment of turn T, we are at y_T and we check collision for freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo if we are at y_T = k (with k in 1..8) at turn T, then we check all cars on freeway k at turn T: if any car's span at turn T contains 0, then collision.\n\nBut note: each freeway may have multiple cars. So we have to check all cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are starting at turn 11 at y=4. We are going to plan a sequence of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car positions at future turns. We are at t1=11. For a future turn T, we compute the car spans for each freeway and each car.\n\nWe note that the freeways that have cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=-30, tau=-41, d=right, s=3) -> at T: [ -41 + 3*(T-11), -30 + 3*(T-11) ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (18,7,right,6) -> [7+6*(T-11), 18+6*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2: (18,7,right,6) -> same as above\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: \n  car1: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(T-11), 60+12*(T-11)]\n  car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(T-11), 12+12*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: two cars with the same parameters.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: \n  car1: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12*(T-11), -36+12*(T-11)]\n  car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(T-11), 12+12*(T-11)]\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe start at turn 11 at y=4. We are on freeway 4 at turn 11? Let's check freeway 4 at turn 11.\n\nFreeway 4: car: [7+6*(0), 18+6*(0)] = [7,18] -> does 0 in [7,18]? No. So safe.\n\nNow, we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nGoal: reach y=9. The minimal number of moves without considering cars is 5 moves up (U). But we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe can also consider moving down? But that would take us away from 9, so unless necessary, we avoid. But sometimes we might have to wait by staying or even move down to avoid a collision.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 11 onward, and we want the minimal H.\n\nWe can try to go up as fast as possible and check for collisions.\n\nPlan: \n  Turn 11: we are at y=4. We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to get to 9, so ideally we go up every turn until we get to 9.\n\nBut we must check for collisions at each freeway we step on.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns:\n\nAt turn 11: we are at y=4. We do an action that will set y_12.\n\nLet me denote the turn and the y at that turn.\n\nTurn 11: y=4.\n\nWe consider actions for turn 11, then turn 12, etc.\n\nWe need to check for each turn T, if we are at y_T in [1,8], then check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe start at T=11, y=4: safe (as above).\n\nNow, we want to go to y=5 at turn 12? So we do U at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 12: y=5. Now we are on freeway 5. Check freeway 5 at turn 12.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars at turn 12 (T=12, so T-11=1):\n\n  car1: [49+12*1, 60+12*1] = [61,72] -> doesn't contain 0? (0 is not in [61,72])\n  car2: [1+12*1, 12+12*1] = [13,24] -> doesn't contain 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at turn 12, we do U again -> turn 13: y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 at turn 13: T-11=2.\n\nFreeway 6 cars (same as freeway5):\n\n  car1: [49+12*2, 60+12*2] = [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> no 0.\n  car2: [1+12*2,12+24]= [25,36] -> no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 13: do U -> turn 14: y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 14: T-11=3.\n\n  car1: [49+12*3,60+36]= [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> no 0.\n  car2: [1+36,12+36]= [37,48] -> no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 14: do U -> turn 15: y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 15: T-11=4.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars:\n\n  car1: (-36,-47,right,12) -> at T=15: [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12]\n  car2: [1+12*4,12+48] = [49,60]\n\nCheck: car1: [1,12] -> contains 0? 0 is not in [1,12] (since 0<1). \ncar2: [49,60] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn 15: do U -> turn 16: y=9. We are at the goal.\n\nSo we did: \n  Turn11: U -> from 4 to 5\n  Turn12: U -> from 5 to 6\n  Turn13: U -> from 6 to 7\n  Turn14: U -> from 7 to 8\n  Turn15: U -> from 8 to 9\n\nTotal turns: 5 actions (from turn11 to turn15) and we reach at turn16? \n\nWait: at turn11 we are at y4. After action at turn11, we get to turn12 at y5. Then after turn15 action (U) we get to turn16 at y9.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: we have a sequence of actions for t = t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (after H actions) we are at y = 9.\n\nSpecifically: \n  At turn t1 (11): we are at y4. Then we take H actions: at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at y9.\n\nIn the above, we have H=5 actions: at turns 11,12,13,14,15. Then at turn16 we are at y9. So H=5.\n\nBut we must check if we are safe at every step. We checked:\n\nTurn11: at y4 -> safe\nTurn12: at y5 -> safe\nTurn13: at y6 -> safe\nTurn14: at y7 -> safe\nTurn15: at y8 -> safe\n\nAnd then at turn16 we are at y9 (goal) and we don't care about collision on freeway? Because freeways are only 1-8.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 5 turns.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway 1,2,3,4? We passed freeway 4 at turn11, 5 at turn12, 6 at turn13, 7 at turn14, 8 at turn15. We didn't go to freeway 1,2,3.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at turn15: we have car1: [1,12] and car2: [49,60]. 0 is not in [1,12] (since 0<1) and not in [49,60]. So safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway8 car1: at turn15: [1,12]. The player is at x=0, and the car is from 1 to 12. Since the car is moving right, and at turn15 it is at [1,12], so 0 is not in the span. So safe.\n\nHowever, note that the car representation: for a right-moving car, the span is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. In freeway8 car1: head=-36, tail=-47? Then at T=15: \n  tail = -47 + 12*(4) = -47+48 = 1\n  head = -36 + 48 = 12\nSo [1,12]. Correct.\n\nIs there any other freeway that we might have stepped on? No, because we went straight up.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? For example, if we had to wait, we might have to go through them, but we didn't.\n\nSo why is there freeway 1,2,3,4 with cars? They might be dangerous if we were to go through them at a bad time. But we only passed freeway4 at turn11 (which was safe) and then moved up.\n\nBut let me check freeway4 at turn11: [7,18] -> 0 not in there.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway1? We didn't. So we are safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for t from 0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nSo for H=5, we have actions at turns 11,12,13,14,15.\n\nBut we must also check if there is a possibility of a shorter path? The minimal moves without obstacles is 5 (since 9-4=5). So we cannot do less than 5. So 5 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we could skip some freeways? We cannot: we have to go from 4 to 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9. So 5 steps.\n\nBut is there a danger that if we go slower we might avoid something? But we don't need to because going straight up is safe.\n\nHowever, let me check the other freeways to see if there is any car that might hit at the same time? For example, what if at turn11, freeway4 was unsafe? But we checked it was safe.\n\nBut wait: I just realized: at turn11 we are at y4, and we are about to take an action. The collision check at turn11 is already done? Actually, the problem says: collision occurs at turn T if ... when we are on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo at the start of turn11, we are at (0,4). Then we are on freeway4 at turn11? So we must check freeway4 at turn11. We did: [7,18] does not contain 0 -> safe. Then we take an action.\n\nSimilarly, at turn12: we are at y5 (because we did U at turn11) and then we check freeway5 at turn12: safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway1? It has a car: at turn T: [-41+3*(T-11), -30+3*(T-11)]\n\nWe never step on freeway1, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: [7+6*(T-11), 18+6*(T-11)]\n\nWe are at freeway2? We never go to freeway2 because we start at 4 and go up. So we skip freeway2 and 3? Actually, we go from 4 to 5, then 6,7,8. So we skip 1,2,3? But we are at 4 at turn11, then 5 at turn12, so we don't step on 1,2,3.\n\nBut wait: the player can move only one step at a time, so we cannot skip freeways: we must traverse each freeway we step on.\n\nBut we did step on freeway4 (at turn11), then freeway5 (turn12), then 6 (turn13), then 7 (turn14), then 8 (turn15). So we never step on freeway1,2,3. So we are safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway3 at turn11: [7,18] -> safe, but we are not on it. Similarly, freeway2 at turn11: same [7,18] -> safe, but we are not on it.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, and the actions are U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut wait, the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n\nSo for t1=11:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut note: we are at turn11 and we are at y4. After U at turn11, we are at y5 at turn12. Then after U at turn12, we are at y6 at turn13, etc.\n\nAnd at turn16, we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem says: we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? Let me read:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we update to the next turn (t1+H) and we must be at y=9 at that turn.\n\nSo we are at turn t1+H = 11+H. We want to be at (0,9) at turn 11+H.\n\nIn our case: H=5, then turn 16: y=9. Correct.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H and ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd in the update: after action a_t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t (we are at y_t), we take action a_t, then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that sets y_T = 9.\n\nIn our case, we are at turn11: y=4. We want to be at turn T: y=9. Then T = 11 + H? \n\nBut note: we take H actions: at turns 11, 12, ..., 11+H-1. Then at turn 11+H, we have y_{11+H} = 9.\n\nSo the turn we reach is turn 11+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1\".\n\nSo H is the number of actions. The time from start to finish is H turns? Actually, the number of turns that pass is H (because we start at turn11 and after H actions we are at turn11+H). But the problem says \"turns\" meaning the number of actions? \n\nYes, because we are to output H actions.\n\nSo H=5.\n\nBut wait: what if we can do it in less? For example, by moving faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So minimal is 5.\n\nBut note: we can also stay or move down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo 5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me verify the cars again to ensure we are safe at each step.\n\nTurn11: y=4 -> freeway4: [7+6*(0), 18+6*0] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\nTurn12: y=5 -> freeway5: \n  car1: [49+12*(12-11)=49+12=61, 60+12=72] -> 0 not in [61,72]\n  car2: [1+12,12+12]= [13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn13: y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 at turn13? \n  T-11=2: \n  car1: [49+24=73, 60+24=84]\n  car2: [1+24=25,12+24=36] -> safe.\n\nTurn14: y=7 -> freeway7: same as above, T-11=3:\n  car1: [49+36=85,60+36=96]\n  car2: [1+36=37,12+36=48] -> safe.\n\nTurn15: y=8 -> freeway8: \n  car1: [-47+12*(15-11)= -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] (since 0<1) -> safe.\n  car2: [1+12*4=49,12+48=60] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut wait: what about the other cars on freeway8? We have two cars. We checked both.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" meaning the action at turn t1.\n\nBut note: the initial position is at turn t1 (11) and we are at (0,4). Then we take action at turn11.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut wait, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so we have 5 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut wait, is there a problem at freeway8? The car1 at turn15 is at [1,12]. What if we are at freeway8 at an earlier turn? But we are only at freeway8 at turn15.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at turn14? We are not on freeway8 at turn14 (we are at y7 at turn14). But for completeness:\n\nAt turn14: freeway8 car1: [-47+12*(14-11)= -47+36=-11, -36+36=0] -> [-11,0]. Does this contain 0? Yes, because 0 is in [-11,0]. But we are not on freeway8 at turn14. We are on freeway7 at turn14.\n\nSimilarly, at turn15: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nBut what if we had been on freeway8 at turn14? Then we would have collided. But we weren't.\n\nSo our path is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we try to go faster? We cannot.\n\nOr what if we go slower? Then H would be more than 5, so we don't want.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we can avoid a collision by waiting? But we don't need to.\n\nBut let me see if there is a car that might hit at freeway5,6,7,8 at the times we are there? We checked and they are safe.\n\nBut note: freeway5 at turn12: car2 is at [13,24] -> safe. But what if we were at freeway5 at an earlier time? For example, if we had started earlier? But we are at turn12.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway8: we are at turn15, and car1 is at [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at turn16? But we are at y9 at turn16, so we don't care.\n\nBut what if we had to wait at freeway7? We don't.\n\nSo I think we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the freeway1 car: at turn T: [-41+3*(T-11), -30+3*(T-11)]\n\nWhen would it hit 0? We solve: \n  -41 + 3*(T-11) <= 0 <= -30 + 3*(T-11)\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 3*(T-11) <= 0 -> 3*(T-11) <= 41 -> T-11 <= 41/3 ≈ 13.666 -> T <= 24.666 -> so T<=24.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -30 + 3*(T-11) -> 30 <= 3*(T-11) -> T-11 >= 10 -> T>=21.\n\nSo for T from 21 to 24 inclusive, the car on freeway1 would be at 0. But we are not going to freeway1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: [7+6*(T-11), 18+6*(T-11)] contains 0?\n  7+6*(T-11) <= 0 <= 18+6*(T-11)\n\nFirst: 7+6*(T-11) <=0 -> 6*(T-11)<=-7 -> which is impossible since T>=11. So never contains 0? \n\nBut wait: the car is at freeway2, which we never step on. But for completeness: \n  7+6*(T-11) is at least 7 at T=11, and increases. So always positive. So 0 is never in [7+6*(T-11), 18+6*(T-11)] because the lower bound is at least 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 and 4: same as freeway2? Freeway2,3,4 have the same car: (18,7,right,6). So same: the span starts at 7 and goes up. So 0 is never in the span.\n\nFreeway5: \n  car1: [49+12*(T-11), 60+12*(T-11)] -> starts at 49 and increases -> never 0.\n  car2: [1+12*(T-11), 12+12*(T-11)] -> \n      When does 0 in this? \n      1+12*(T-11) <=0 and 0<=12+12*(T-11)\n      The second inequality: 0<=12+12*(T-11) -> always true for T>=11.\n      First: 1+12*(T-11) <=0 -> 12*(T-11) <= -1 -> T-11 <= -1/12 -> T<=10. something -> impossible.\n\nSo car2 on freeway5 is always above 1? at T=11: [1,12] -> 1 to 12. 0 is not in [1,12]. Then at T=12: [13,24], etc. So never contains 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 and 7: same.\n\nFreeway8: \n  car1: [-47+12*(T-11), -36+12*(T-11)]\n      Contains 0 when: \n        -47+12*(T-11) <= 0 <= -36+12*(T-11)\n      First: -47+12*(T-11)<=0 -> 12*(T-11)<=47 -> T-11<=47/12≈3.916 -> T<=14.916 -> T<=14\n      Second: 0<=-36+12*(T-11) -> 36<=12*(T-11) -> T-11>=3 -> T>=14.\n\n      So T=14: \n        T-11=3: \n          lower: -47+36 = -11\n          upper: -36+36=0\n          so [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is closed? The problem says \"span\", and we have [A,B] inclusive? \n\n      So at T=14, car1 on freeway8 is at [-11,0] -> which contains 0.\n\n  car2: [1+12*(T-11),12+12*(T-11)] -> as above, never contains 0.\n\nSo at turn14, if we were on freeway8, we would collide. But in our plan we are at freeway7 at turn14, and then we move to freeway8 at turn15. At turn15, car1 is at [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut if we had been on freeway8 at turn14, we would have been hit. But we are not.\n\nSo our path avoids that.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5, which is minimal.\n\nBut note: we are at y4 at turn11. After 5 U moves, we get to y9 at turn16.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Then the next turn is t1+H, and we are at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nSo the turn when we arrive is t1+H = 11+H.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn 16, so H=5.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nNo, it doesn't specify the turn of arrival. It just says \"reach (0,9)\". The arrival turn is after the last action.\n\nIn the update: after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we update to turn t1+H and position y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem does not specify that we must be at (0,9) at a particular turn, only that we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to the arrival.\n\nSo we are safe at turns 11 to 15 (the turns we are on freeways) and then at turn16 we are at y9, which is safe.\n\nSo I think that's correct.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me see if we can do it in 4 turns? That would require moving up 5 steps in 4 moves? But we can only move one step per move. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are not on any freeway at turn16 (y9 is not a freeway with cars).\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nOne last check: at turn15 we are at y8, which is a freeway. We checked: safe.\n\nSo I think it's done.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 11 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\) includes the x-coordinate 0.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal path without obstacles requires 5 moves up (U) since \\(9 - 4 = 5\\).\n- The sequence of actions must be checked for collisions at each turn when the player is on a freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)).\n\n### Car Positions at Relevant Turns (relative to turn 11, \\(T = 11 + t\\)):\n- **Freeway 4** (at turn 11):  \n  Car: \\((18, 7, \\text{right}, 6)\\) → Span at \\(T\\): \\([7 + 6(t), 18 + 6(t)]\\).  \n  At \\(t = 0\\) (turn 11): \\([7, 18]\\) → 0 not in span → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 5** (at turn 12):  \n  Cars:  \n  - \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\) → \\([49 + 12(t), 60 + 12(t)]\\)  \n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\) → \\([1 + 12(t), 12 + 12(t)]\\)  \n  At \\(t = 1\\) (turn 12):  \n    - First car: \\([61, 72]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n    - Second car: \\([13, 24]\\) → 0 not in span → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 6** (at turn 13): Same cars as freeway 5.  \n  At \\(t = 2\\) (turn 13):  \n    - First car: \\([73, 84]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n    - Second car: \\([25, 36]\\) → 0 not in span → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 7** (at turn 14): Same cars as freeway 5.  \n  At \\(t = 3\\) (turn 14):  \n    - First car: \\([85, 96]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n    - Second car: \\([37, 48]\\) → 0 not in span → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 8** (at turn 15):  \n  Cars:  \n  - \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 12)\\) → \\([-47 + 12(t), -36 + 12(t)]\\)  \n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\) → \\([1 + 12(t), 12 + 12(t)]\\)  \n  At \\(t = 4\\) (turn 15):  \n    - First car: \\([1, 12]\\) → 0 not in span (since \\(0 < 1\\)).  \n    - Second car: \\([49, 60]\\) → 0 not in span → safe.\n\n### Proposed Action Sequence:\n- Turn 11: Move up (U) → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 12.\n- Turn 12: Move up (U) → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13.\n- Turn 13: Move up (U) → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14.\n- Turn 14: Move up (U) → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15.\n- Turn 15: Move up (U) → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n\nThis sequence requires \\(H = 5\\) turns (actions at turns 11 to 15). The player reaches (0, 9) at turn 16, which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed. All intermediate positions on freeways (4 at turn 11, 5 at turn 12, 6 at turn 13, 7 at turn 14, 8 at turn 15) are safe, as verified.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible because 5 moves are required to cover the vertical distance, and moving slower (e.g., including stays or downs) would increase \\(H\\). Thus, \\(H = 5\\) is minimal.\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are moving left or right, and I need to avoid being on a row when a car is covering position x=0 at that turn. The key point is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, I collide if there's a car on that row with 0 in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that new row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check for collision on the row I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=12, and I need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each row:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-27, -38, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-38, -27] at t=12? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span [h, τ] becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3). It says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, head is larger, I think? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end, so at t1, position from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so h is right end, τ is left end, but since it's moving left, the values decrease.\n\nIn this case, all cars given are right-moving, I think.\n\nFreeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3). So head h = -27, tail τ = -38, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince right-moving, at time t, span is [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)] = [-38 + 3(t-12), -27 + 3(t-12)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on that row at turn T.\n\nI start at y=5 at t=12.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars there since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, I think. The grid has y from 0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nBut the player position is (0,y), so at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nGoal is to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nMinimize turns from t=12 onwards.\n\nI need to go from y=5 to y=9, so I need to move up at least 4 times, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, but since time is important, I should minimize waiting, but sometimes I have to wait to avoid collision.\n\nAlso, moving down might be necessary if I need to dodge, but in this case, since I'm going up, and cars are moving, I might not need to go down.\n\nBut let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, when a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for each car on it, find the times T when 0 is in the span at that T.\n\nThen, at turn T, if I am on row k, I must not have any car on k with 0 in span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per row, but for each row, I need that no car covers 0 at time T if I'm on row k at time T.\n\nNow, for each row, let's list the cars and find the critical times.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, one car: h=-27, τ=-38, d=right, s=3 at t1=12.\n\nSpan at time T: [ -38 + 3(T-12), -27 + 3(T-12) ]\n\nSet 0 in this interval:\n\n-38 + 3(T-12) ≤ 0 ≤ -27 + 3(T-12)\n\nLet u = T-12, so time offset.\n\nThen -38 + 3u ≤ 0 ≤ -27 + 3u\n\nSplit:\n\n-38 + 3u ≤ 0 => 3u ≤ 38 => u ≤ 38/3 ≈ 12.666\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -27 + 3u => 3u ≥ 27 => u ≥ 9\n\nSo u between 9 and 12.666, since u integer, u=9,10,11,12\n\nu=T-12, so T=21,22,23,24\n\nT=12 + u, u=9,10,11,12 so T=21,22,23,24\n\nNow, at T=12, u=0: -38 +0 = -38, -27+0=-27, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, T=13, u=1: -38+3=-35, -27+3=-24, still negative.\n\n...\n\nUntil u=9: -38+27= -11? u=9: -38 + 3*9 = -38+27= -11\n\n-27 + 27=0, so 0 is included since ≤0 and ≥0, so at u=9, T=21, left end -11, right end 0, so 0 is the right end, included.\n\nSimilarly u=10: -38+30= -8, -27+30=3, so -8 to 3, 0 inside.\n\nu=11: -38+33= -5, -27+33=6, 0 inside.\n\nu=12: -38+36= -2, -27+36=9, 0 inside.\n\nu=13: -38+39=1, -27+39=12, 1 to 12, 0 not inside since 1>0.\n\nSo T=21,22,23,24 have collision on row 1.\n\nT=21 to 24 inclusive.\n\nNow, freeway 2: k=2, one car: (24,13, right,6)\n\nHead h=24, tail τ=13? But for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [13,24] at t=12? τ=13, h=24, so left to right, 13 to 24.\n\nIn the table: (24,13,right,6), but it says head h, tail τ, and for right, h should be larger, so h=24, τ=13, yes.\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [13 + 6(u), 24 + 6(u)] with u=T-12.\n\nSet 0 in [13+6u, 24+6u]\n\n13+6u ≤ 0 ≤ 24+6u\n\nFirst, 13+6u ≤ 0 => 6u ≤ -13, but u≥0, 6u≥0, 13+6u≥13>0, so never ≤0? So 0 cannot be in the interval because left end is at least 13 at u=0, which is positive and increasing, so always positive, 0 never in the span. So no collision on row 2 ever? Let me check.\n\nAt u=0, [13,24], both positive.\n\nu=1, [19,30], etc., all positive, so indeed, since τ=13>0, and moving right, so left end always positive, so x=0 never covered. So freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24,13,right,6), identical, so also always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (24,13,right,6), always safe.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst, car1: h=-48? Head and tail, for right-moving.\n\nGiven (-48, -59, right, 12), so τ=-59, h=-48? Since for right, head is larger, so h=-48, τ=-59? -48 > -59, yes.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(u), h + s(u)] = [-59 + 12u, -48 + 12u] with u=T-12.\n\nSet 0 in this: -59 +12u ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12u\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +12u ≤0 => 12u ≤59 => u ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so u≤4 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +12u => 12u ≥48 => u≥4\n\nSo u=4, T=12+4=16\n\nAt u=4, -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nu=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nu=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=16, collision possible from first car.\n\nNow second car on row 5: (24,13,right,12), same as before, τ=13, h=24, s=12.\n\nSpan: [13 +12u, 24+12u]\n\nAlways positive, so never covers 0. Safe.\n\nSo on row 5, only at T=16, when first car covers 0, collision if on row 5 at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars, both same as row 5? (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as row 5, so at T=16, collision possible.\n\nSecond car: always safe.\n\nSo row 6 has collision at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same cars, (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12), so collision at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nSecond: (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan: [-35 +12u, -24 +12u]\n\nSet 0 in: -35+12u ≤0 ≤ -24+12u\n\nFirst: -35+12u ≤0 => 12u≤35 => u≤35/12≈2.916, u≤2\n\nSecond: 0≤ -24+12u => 12u≥24 => u≥2\n\nSo u=2, T=12+2=14\n\nAt u=2, -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), always safe.\n\nSo row 8 collision at T=14.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, unsafe times:\n\n- Row 1: unsafe at T=21,22,23,24\n\n- Row 2: always safe\n\n- Row 3: always safe\n\n- Row 4: always safe\n\n- Row 5: unsafe at T=16\n\n- Row 6: unsafe at T=16\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at T=16\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at T=14\n\nAlso, rows 2,3,4 always safe.\n\nI start at t=12, y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I must pass through rows 6,7,8 or stay, but I need to reach 9.\n\nSince rows 2,3,4 are always safe, I can stay there if needed, but I need to go up.\n\nNow, the unsafe times: row 5,6,7 unsafe at T=16, row 8 unsafe at T=14, row 1 unsafe later.\n\nBut row 1 is below, I'm at 5 going to 9, so I probably don't care about row 1.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 unsafe only at T=14.\n\nNow, at t=12, I am on row 5.\n\nAt t=12, row 5: is it unsafe? At T=12, u=0, for row 5, first car span [-59, -48], both negative, not 0. Second car [13,24], not 0. So safe at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 same, safe at t=12.\n\nRow 7 same.\n\nRow 8: at t=12, u=0, first car [-35,-24], both negative, not 0; second [13,24], not 0, safe.\n\nBut row 8 unsafe at T=14.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal moves: if I go up every turn, I can reach in 4 turns: from t=12, y=5.\n\nt=12: y=5\n\nt=13: move U, y=6\n\nt=14: move U, y=7\n\nt=15: move U, y=8\n\nt=16: move U, y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=12: on row 5, safe as above.\n\nt=13: I move to y=6? At turn t, I start on y_t, then I choose action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if on row y_T and car on that row covers x=0 at T.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=12: on y=5, row 5 safe at t=12.\n\nI move U, so at t=13, I am on y=6.\n\nt=13: on y=6, is it safe? Row 6 at t=13.\n\nu=t-12=1 for t=13.\n\nRow 6 cars: first car (-48,-59,right,12), span at T: [-59 +12u, -48+12u]\n\nAt u=1: -59+12= -47, -48+12= -36, both negative, not 0.\n\nSecond car, [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not 0. So safe.\n\nI move U, so at t=14, on y=7.\n\nt=14: on y=7.\n\nRow 7 same as row 6, cars: first [-59+12u, -48+12u], u=2 (t=14, t-12=2)\n\n-59+24= -35, -48+24= -24, both negative, not 0.\n\nSecond car [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not 0. Safe.\n\nBut row 7 unsafe at T=16, but t=14 is not 16.\n\nNow, I move U at t=14, so at t=15, on y=8.\n\nt=15: on y=8.\n\nRow 8 at t=15.\n\nu=t-12=3\n\nFirst car: span [-35 +12u, -24 +12u] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], both positive, not 0.\n\nSecond car: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], not 0. So safe.\n\nBut row 8 unsafe at T=14, but t=15 is safe.\n\nNow, at t=15, I move U to y=9 at t=16.\n\nt=16: I am on y=8? No.\n\nAt turn t=15, I am on y=8.\n\nI choose action, say U, so y_{16} = y_{15} +1 =9.\n\nBut at turn t=16, I start on y_{16}, which is 9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible. I reach (0,9) at t=16.\n\nBut let's confirm the position.\n\nAt t=16, I am on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, but at t=16, row 8: what about row 8 at t=16?\n\nBut I am not on row 8 at t=16, I am on row 9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=15: on y=8, safe.\n\nI move U, so at t=16, I am on y=9.\n\nAt turn t=16, I am on row y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSimilarly, earlier turns were safe.\n\nBut row 5,6,7 unsafe at T=16.\n\nAt t=16, if I were on row 5,6, or 7, it would be unsafe.\n\nBut in this sequence, at t=16, I am on y=9, not on those rows.\n\nt=16, I am on y=9.\n\nWhat about row 8 at t=16? Row 8 at t=16: u=4\n\nFirst car: [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], not 0.\n\nSecond car [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], not 0. Safe anyway.\n\nBut row 8 unsafe only at T=14.\n\nIn this sequence, all seems fine.\n\nBut at t=14, I was on y=7, which is safe.\n\nIn my sequence: t=12: y=5, safe\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\nt=14: y=7, safe\n\nt=15: y=8, safe\n\nt=16: y=9, safe\n\nAnd I used 4 moves: U at t=12,13,14,15 to go from 5 to 9 in 4 turns.\n\nBut is y=9 reached at t=16? Start at t=12, y=5.\n\nAfter one U at t=12, y=6 at t=13.\n\nAfter U at t=13, y=7 at t=14.\n\nU at t=14, y=8 at t=15.\n\nU at t=15, y=9 at t=16.\n\nYes, at turn t=16, I am at (0,9).\n\nAnd all positions were safe.\n\nBut the unsafe times: row 5 unsafe at T=16, but at T=16, I am not on row 5, I am on row 9.\n\nSimilarly, row 6,7 unsafe at T=16, but not on them.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=14, but at T=14 I was on row 7, which was safe.\n\nSo seems no problem.\n\nBut let me confirm row 7 at t=14.\n\nt=14, u=2, row 7: first car [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], not 0; second [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not 0. Safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo with 4 turns, I can reach.\n\nBut the minimal number should be 4, since I need to increase by 4.\n\nIs there a way in fewer? 3 turns? From y=5 to y=9, I need to go up 4 times, so at least 4 actions, so H=4 turns of actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: from t=12 to t=15, I perform actions, and at t=16 I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=12 to t=15, that's 4 actions: a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}.\n\nEach action corresponds to the turn.\n\nThe player position after actions.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at the next turn, I am at that position.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at turn T, meaning y_T =9.\n\nI start at t=12, y=5.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay, I remain at 5.\n\nBut I need to reach 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H turns, I am at 9.\n\nAt turn t=12 + t, for t=0 to H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t=12 + H, position y_{12+H}.\n\nSet y_{12+H} =9.\n\nSince I start at y=5, and each action changes y by at most 1, I need at least 4 up moves, so H at least 4.\n\nWith H=4, I can be at y=9 at t=16.\n\nIn my sequence, it works.\n\nBut is there a problem with row 8 at t=14?\n\nIn my sequence, at t=14, I am on y=7, not on row 8.\n\nRow 8 is unsafe only at t=14, but I am not there at that time.\n\nAt t=14, if I were on row 8, it would be unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, rows 5,6,7 unsafe, but I'm on row 9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster? But H=4 is minimum.\n\nH=4 actions: from t=12 to t=15, actions, then at t=16, position is 9.\n\nThe answer should list actions starting from t_1=12.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=12,13,14,15 all U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nIn this case H=4, so actions at t1 + 0 =12, t1+1=13, t1+2=14, t1+3=15.\n\nEach U.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else?\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nOr move down, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nBut let me check if at t=16, when I go to y=9, but y=9 is safe.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I can reach earlier, but from y=5 to y=9, min 4 moves.\n\nUnless I can go faster, but the moves are only +1,-1,0, so min 4 up moves.\n\nSo H=4 is minimum.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=15, I am on y=8, and I move U to y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut row 8 at t=15 is safe, as I calculated.\n\nAnother thing: at t=14, row 8 is unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nSuppose I try to go faster, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I start moving earlier, but I start at t=12, y=5.\n\nt=12: if I move U, to y=6 at t=13.\n\nCannot be at y=9 before t=16.\n\nt=12: y=5\n\nt=13: y=6 if U\n\nt=14: y=7\n\nt=15: y=8\n\nt=16: y=9\n\nYes, t=16 is earliest.\n\nIf I move multiple, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nBut in the car states, for row 5,6,7, unsafe at T=16, but since I'm not on them at T=16, fine.\n\nBut let me double-check row 5 at T=16.\n\nT=16, u=4, row 5 first car: [-59 +12*4, -48+48] = [-59+48, 0] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if on row 5 at t=16, collision.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: same, [-59+48,0]=[-11,0], collision.\n\nRow 7: same, collision.\n\nBut at t=16, in my sequence, I am on y=9.\n\nNow, what about when I move? For example, at turn t=15, I am on y=8, and I move U, so during the move, but the collision is only checked at the start of the turn, based on the row I'm on.\n\nAs per the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T, I am on y_T, and only cars on y_T matter.\n\nSo in the move, no issue.\n\nSo my sequence seems fine.\n\nBut let me see if I need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nFor example, if I were to be on row 8 at t=14, it would be unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, rows 5-7 unsafe.\n\nBut since I'm past them, fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go through row 1, but that would be longer, since row 1 is below, and has unsafe times later, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think H=4 with all U is possible.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, it has a car, but I don't go there.\n\nSimilarly, rows 2,3,4 are safe, but I don't need to go down.\n\nSo actions: at turn 12: U\n\nturn 13: U\n\nturn 14: U\n\nturn 15: U\n\nThen at turn 16, position (0,9).\n\nThe sequence should be for t from t1 to t1+H-1, with H=4.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut is turn 15 included? t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: t1, t=1: t1+1, ..., t=H-1: t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case H=4, so actions at t=12,13,14,15.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=15 I move U, to y=9 at t=16.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions clearly.\n\nAnother thing: at t=15, I am on y=8, and row 8 is safe at t=15, as [1,12] not include 0.\n\nBut row 8 was unsafe at t=14, but I'm not there.\n\nSuppose I do something else, like stay or move down, but that would delay, so worse.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=12, then y=5 at t=13, then I need more moves.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nPerhaps to avoid row 8 at t=14, but I don't need to, since I'm not on it.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on row 7 at t=14, safe.\n\nBut let me see the row 7 car: at t=14, u=2, span [-35,-24] and [37,48], no 0.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in H=4 with different actions, but all U is fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the context, H is the length of the action sequence.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach.\n\nIn this case, with 4 actions, I reach at turn 16.\n\nIs there a way with H=3? Then I would be at turn t=12+3=15, position y_{15}.\n\nStart y=5 at t=12.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at t=15, y_{15}.\n\nIf I go up all, y=5 +3 =8, since each U increase by 1.\n\nSo at t=15, y=8.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, so not yet.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can't, only +1 per move.\n\nSo impossible with H=3.\n\nWith H=4, I can be at y=9 at t=16.\n\nWith H=5, I could be later, but minimal H=4.\n\nIn my sequence, it works.\n\nBut let me check row 8 at t=14 again.\n\nSuppose at some point I am on a row when unsafe.\n\nFor example, if I had stayed at y=5 longer.\n\nBut in direct path, fine.\n\nPerhaps for row 5,6,7 at t=16 unsafe, but since I leave before, ok.\n\nAnother thing: when I am on row 5 at t=12, safe, I move to row 6 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, row 6 safe.\n\nMove to row 7 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, row 7 safe.\n\nMove to row 8 at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, row 8 safe.\n\nMove to row 9 at t=16.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut row 8 is safe at t=15, as I said.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on row 8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nAt t=15, u=3\n\nFirst car: [-35 +12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSecond car: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], no.\n\nAt t=14, u=2: first car [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included, so if on row 8 at t=14, collision.\n\nBut I am on row 7 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, row 5: u=4, first car [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0], 0 included, so unsafe, but I am on row 9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 4 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,5) at t=12.\n\nCar state seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother row: freeway 1 has cars, but I don't care.\n\nOr rows 2,3,4 safe.\n\nIn freeway 5,6,7, there are two cars, but only the first one causes issue at t=16.\n\nBut in my path, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nSo for H=4.\n\nActions: a_{12} = U, a_{13} = U, a_{14} = U, a_{15} = U.\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nSince t1=12, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for each turn.\n\nPerhaps I should write the turns.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there any reason to do otherwise?\n\nSuppose at t=14, if I were on row 8, it would be bad, but I'm not.\n\nPerhaps I can go through row 4 or something, but row 4 is always safe, but it's below, I would need to go down, which takes more time.\n\nFor example, go to y=4 at some point, but y=4 is safe always, but then from 4 to 9, I need 5 moves, which is worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, minimal is 4 with all up.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 4, as the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate by 4 units to go from 5 to 9, and each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1. The sequence of actions is all \"U\" (up) for four turns, resulting in the following path:\n\n- At turn 12, \\(y = 5\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, \\(y = 6\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 7\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 8\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, the player reaches (0, 9), and no collisions occur during the sequence:\n- Turns 12 to 15 are safe because the player is not on any row at an unsafe time:\n  - Row 5 is unsafe only at turn 16, but the player is on row 5 only at turn 12 (safe).\n  - Row 6 is unsafe only at turn 16, but the player is on row 6 only at turn 13 (safe).\n  - Row 7 is unsafe only at turn 16, but the player is on row 7 only at turn 14 (safe).\n  - Row 8 is unsafe only at turn 14, but the player is on row 8 only at turn 15 (safe, as row 8 at turn 15 has no car covering x=0).\n- Rows 2, 3, and 4 are always safe, but the player does not use them.\n- Rows 1, and the goal row 9, have no cars and are safe.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence of actions is all \"U\" for turns 12 to 15.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,6) at turn t_1 = 13. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay within 0 to 9. Since we start at y=6 and want to go to y=9, we need to move up, but we have to avoid the cars on the freeways when we're on them.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, if you move to a different y at turn T+1, you're only on y_T at turn T, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So for collision, we care about the y-position at the start of the turn before moving.\n\nLet me denote the turn. At turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t). Then, based on action a_t, y_{t+1} is set. But for collision at turn t, it depends on y_t, because that's where you are during turn t.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the y-position at turn T, I assume.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which makes sense; you're on y_T during turn T, and only move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo, to avoid collision at turn T, we need that for freeway y_T, no car has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute turn number.\n\nNow, current turn is t_1 = 13, player at y=6.\n\nWe need to find actions from t=13 onwards to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -24, tail -35? That seems odd. For right-moving cars, head should be greater than tail, I think. Let me read the car update.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since it's right-moving, head > tail, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nBut for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nHere, head h = -24, tail τ = -35? But -24 > -35, so τ = -35, h = -24? But it's written as (head, tail, direction, speed), I think.\n\nLook at the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and h = -24, τ = -35, so h > τ, which is correct for right-moving: head at higher x.\n\nBut x positions, I assume. The freeway is horizontal, so cars span from left to right or right to left.\n\nBut since the player is at x=0, we care when the car spans include x=0.\n\nNow, for freeway 1 at turn t_1=13: car with τ = -35, h = -24, d=right, s=3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13)] = [-35 + 3(T-13), -24 + 3(T-13)]\n\nWe need to find when this span includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway, as multiple cars can be on one freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=3)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (30, 19, right, 6) — h=30, τ=19? But for right-moving, if d=right, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, but here h=30, τ=19, and 19<30, so τ=19, h=30.\n\nIn the input, it's (head, tail), so for freeway 2: head=30, tail=19, d=right, s=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (30,19,right,6) — probably another car.\n\nFreeway 3: (30,19,right,6) — same as freeway 2, but different freeway, so separate.\n\nFreeway 4: (30,19,right,6) — again same.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, d=right, s=12\n\nSince d=right, and head=-36, tail=-47, so τ=-47, h=-36? But for right-moving, head should be on the right, so if x increases to the right, head at higher x, so if tail is left, head is right.\n\nHere tail=-47, head=-36, so tail < head, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36, [25,36] at t_1.\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, d=right, s=12 → τ=-23, h=-12, so [-23,-12] at t_1.\n\nSecond car: same as others, (36,25,right,12) → [25,36] at t_1.\n\nNow, we need to find, for each freeway, when x=0 is covered by a car at time T.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway and time T, if there is a car such that 0 is in [τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, as per data, no left-moving cars here.\n\nAll directions are right, so only right-moving formulas.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13)] if d=right.\n\nThen 0 is in span if min(τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13)) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13))\n\nBut since for right-moving, τ < h, so τ + s(T-13) < h + s(T-13), so the span is [τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13)], and 0 is in it if:\n\nτ + s(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-13)\n\nSimilarly, if left-moving, it would be different, but here all right.\n\nSo collision on freeway i at time T if for some car on i, τ + s(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-13)\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their τ, h, s.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCar: τ = -35, h = -24, s = 3\n\nSo at time T, span: [-35 + 3(T-13), -24 + 3(T-13)]\n\n0 in span if: -35 + 3(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 3(T-13)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst: -35 + 3(T-13) ≤ 0 ⇒ 3(T-13) ≤ 35 ⇒ T-13 ≤ 35/3 ≈ 11.666 ⇒ T ≤ 13 + 11.666 = 24.666, so T ≤ 24 since T integer.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 3(T-13) ⇒ 24 ≤ 3(T-13) ⇒ 8 ≤ T-13 ⇒ T ≥ 21\n\nSo T from 21 to 24 inclusive.\n\nT ≥ 21 and T ≤ 24.\n\nNow, freeway 2:\n\nCar: τ=19, h=30, s=6\n\nSpan: [19 + 6(T-13), 30 + 6(T-13)]\n\n0 in span: 19 + 6(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ 30 + 6(T-13)\n\nFirst inequality: 19 + 6(T-13) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(T-13) ≤ -19 ⇒ T-13 ≤ -19/6 ≈ -3.166, so T ≤ 13 - 3.166 = 9.833, so T ≤ 9\n\nBut T is turn, current T=13, so for T≥13, 19 + 6(T-13) ≥ 19 >0, so left end >0, thus 0 cannot be ≤ left end since left end >0. Inequality is 19 + 6(T-13) ≤ 0, which for T≥13 is false because 19 + something non-negative >=19>0. So no solution for first inequality. Similarly, 0 ≤ 30 + 6(T-13) is always true for T≥13. But since first inequality false, 0 not in span for any T≥13. So no collision on freeway 2 for T≥13.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car as freeway 2: τ=19, h=30, s=6, same thing, no collision for T≥13.\n\nFreeway 4: same, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nSpan: [-47 + 12(T-13), -36 + 12(T-13)]\n\n0 in span: -47 + 12(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12(T-13)\n\nFirst: -47 + 12(T-13) ≤ 0 ⇒ 12(T-13) ≤ 47 ⇒ T-13 ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916 ⇒ T ≤ 16.916, so T ≤ 16\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 + 12(T-13) ⇒ 36 ≤ 12(T-13) ⇒ 3 ≤ T-13 ⇒ T ≥ 16\n\nSo T ≥ 16 and T ≤ 16, so only T=16.\n\n-36 + 12(T-13) ≥ 0 when T-13 ≥ 36/12=3, so T≥16\n\nAnd -47 +12(T-13) ≤0 when T-13 ≤47/12≈3.916, T≤16 since T integer? T≤16.916, so T≤16.\n\nT-13 ≤ 47/12 = 3.916, so T ≤ 13 + 3.916 = 16.916, so T≤16 since T integer.\n\nT≥16 and T≤16, so only T=16.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: τ=25, h=36, s=12\n\nSpan: [25 + 12(T-13), 36 + 12(T-13)]\n\n0 in span: 25 + 12(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ 36 + 12(T-13)\n\nFirst: 25 + 12(T-13) ≤ 0 ⇒ 12(T-13) ≤ -25 ⇒ T-13 ≤ -25/12 ≈ -2.083 ⇒ T ≤ 10.917, so for T≥13, always false.\n\nSecond inequality always true for T≥13, but first false, so 0 not in span. No collision from this car.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only collision at T=16 from first car.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars: first same (-47,-36) and second (25,36), so same, only collision at T=16 from first car.\n\nFreeway 7: same, collision only at T=16.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, so τ=-23, h=-12, s=12\n\nSpan: [-23 + 12(T-13), -12 + 12(T-13)]\n\n0 in span: -23 + 12(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12(T-13)\n\nFirst: -23 +12(T-13) ≤0 ⇒ 12(T-13) ≤23 ⇒ T-13 ≤23/12≈1.916 ⇒ T≤14.916, so T≤14\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 +12(T-13) ⇒ 12 ≤12(T-13) ⇒ 1 ≤ T-13 ⇒ T≥14\n\nSo T≥14 and T≤14, only T=14.\n\nSecond car: same as before, τ=25, h=36, s=12, no collision for T≥13.\n\nSo for freeway 8, collision at T=14 from first car.\n\nNow summarize when each freeway has collision at x=0:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=21,22,23,24\n\n- Freeway 2: no collision\n\n- Freeway 3: no collision\n\n- Freeway 4: no collision\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=16\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=16\n\n- Freeway 7: collision at T=16\n\n- Freeway 8: collision at T=14\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at turn t=13.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny can be from 0 to 9, freeways are 1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it has collision.\n\nSince we start at y=6, and need to reach y=9, which is 3 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 3, since we need to increase y by 3.\n\nBut we might need to take detours.\n\nNow, let's see the collision times.\n\nFirst, at turn T=13, player is on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 has collision at T=16? But T=16 is future.\n\nAt current turn t=13, we are on y=6.\n\nWhat is the state of freeway 6 at T=13?\n\nFor freeway 6, at T=13, the car spans are as given.\n\nFor freeway 6, first car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, at T=13, span [-47, -36], 0 not in, since -36 <0? -36 is negative, so x from -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in, so no collision at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, second car [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=13, no collision on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we are only on y=6 at T=13.\n\nNow, we need to plan actions from t=13 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nSet t=13 as time 0 for simplicity? But the times are absolute, so better to keep absolute turns.\n\nLet me set τ = T - 13, so time offset.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 13), y=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ = H-1, since actions from t=13 to t=13+H-1, and after H actions, we have moved H steps, but y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, we take action, and after action, position is updated.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAnd at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and collision depends on cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nWe start at T=13, y=6.\n\nGoal is to have y =9 at some T, and we need to minimize the number of turns, so minimize the time to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, the minimal time is at least |9-6| =3 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut with cars, we might need more.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: collision at T=21,22,23,24\n\n- y=5: collision at T=16\n\n- y=6: collision at T=16\n\n- y=7: collision at T=16\n\n- y=8: collision at T=14\n\ny=2,3,4 no collision at any time.\n\ny=1 has collision at T=21-24, which is later.\n\nWe start at T=13, y=6.\n\nAt T=13, y=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, we can take action at T=13.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up to y=7 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, if we are on y=7, but freeway 7 has collision at T=14? Freeway 7 collision at T=16, not 14.\n\nFreeway 7: collision only at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 collision at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, if we are on y=8, it would be dangerous.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, suppose we go up immediately.\n\nOption 1: Go up as fast as possible.\n\nAt T=13: action U, so y_{14} = 7\n\nNow, at turn T=13, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nAfter action, position for next turn.\n\nAt T=14, we are on y=7.\n\nNow, freeway 7: collision at T=16, not 14, so at T=14, y=7 is safe? We need to check if freeway 7 has collision at T=14.\n\nFor freeway 7, cars: first car τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, at T=14: τ + s(T-13) = -47 +12(1) = -35, h + s(T-13) = -36 +12 = -24? T=14, T-13=1.\n\nSpan: [-47 +12(1), -36 +12(1)] = [-35, -24], 0 not in, since -24<0.\n\nSecond car: [25 +12(1), 36+12(1)] = [37,48], 0 not in. So safe at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=8 at T=15.\n\nAction at T=14: U, so y_{15} = 8\n\nAt T=14, we are on y=7, safe as above.\n\nThen at T=15, we are on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=14? T=14 is previous, now T=15.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at T=14 only, as per earlier.\n\nAt T=15, freeway 8: first car τ=-23, h=-12, s=12, T-13=2, span [-23 +12(2), -12 +12(2)] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], now 0 in [1,12]? 1 to 12, 0 is less than 1, so 0 not in [1,12], so no collision.\n\nSecond car: [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60], no. So safe at T=15.\n\nThen action at T=15: U, to y=9 at T=16.\n\ny_{16} =9\n\nAt T=15, we are on y=8, safe as above.\n\nThen at T=16, we are on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at T=16.\n\nT=16 is turn number.\n\nSequence: start T=13, y=6\n\nT=13: action U, to y=7 at T=14\n\nT=14: action U, to y=8 at T=15\n\nT=15: action U, to y=9 at T=16\n\nNow, at each turn, we were on:\n\n- T=13: y=6, freeway 6: at T=13, span [-47,-36] and [25,36], 0 not in, safe\n\n- T=14: y=7, freeway 7: at T=14, span [-35,-24] and [37,48], 0 not in, safe\n\n- T=15: y=8, freeway 8: at T=15, span [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in [1,12] since 0<1, so safe\n\n- T=16: y=9, not freeway, safe\n\nSo we reached in 3 turns, H=3.\n\nBut is there a problem? Freeway 6,7,5 have collision at T=16, but at T=16, we are on y=9, not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do it faster? 3 turns is minimal possible, since we need to go from 6 to 9.\n\nBut at T=16, y=9 is safe.\n\nIn this path, we didn't encounter any collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 8 has collision at T=14, but in this path, at T=14 we were on y=7, not y=8.\n\nAt T=14, if we were on y=8, it would be dangerous.\n\nBut we were on y=7.\n\nIn this case, it worked.\n\nBut let's check if at T=16, when we are moving, but no, at T=16 we are on y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or something, but this seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 3 turns.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision times.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at T=14 only.\n\nAt T=14, if on y=8, collision.\n\nBut we were not.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 collision at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, if on y=5,6,7, collision.\n\nBut we are on y=9 at T=16.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIs there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since minimal is 3.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier? From T=13 to T=16, that's 3 actions: at T=13,14,15, reach at T=16.\n\nT=13: action, then position at T=14.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=13, after actions from t=13 to t=13+H-1, we have y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, action at t1 +0 = t1, which affects position at t1 +1.\n\nAfter action at time T, position at T+1 is updated.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, then action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAnd at turn T, collision based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nWe want y_{T_final} =9 for some T_final.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, the last position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart: at turn t1=13, position y_{13} =6.\n\nAfter action a_{13}, y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{13 + k}, y_{14 + k} = y_{13 + k} + Δy_{13+k}\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{14} to y_{13+H}, and we want y_{13+H} =9? No.\n\nAfter the last action at turn t1 + (H-1), we have position at turn t1 + H.\n\nAnd we want that position to be (0,9).\n\nSo y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t1=13, so y_{13+H} =9.\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nAt T=13: action U, so y_{14} =7\n\nAt T=14: action U, so y_{15} =8\n\nAt T=15: action U, so y_{16} =9\n\nSo after 3 actions, at turn 16, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, which is 3.\n\ny_{13+H} = y_{16} =9, so H=3.\n\nNow, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nWhat about freeway 1 at later times, but we don't care since we are not on it.\n\nIn this path, we only used y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 at T=13: safe\n\ny=7 at T=14: for freeway 7, at T=14, as computed, span [-35,-24] and [37,48], 0 not in.\n\ny=8 at T=15: freeway 8 at T=15, span [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8 at T=15: first car, τ=-23, h=-12, s=12, T-13=2, so τ +12(2)= -23+24=1, h +12(2)= -12+24=12, so [1,12], min=1, max=12, 0 not in since 0<1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 8, it has (-12,-23,right,12), which is head=-12, tail=-23, so τ=-23, h=-12, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo with 3 turns: actions at t=13: U, t=14: U, t=15: U.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t_1=13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 16.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? No, because we need to go up 3 times.\n\nWe could go up faster? But only one step per turn.\n\nOr go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nBut let's see if at some point we have to avoid.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=7 at T=14, but if we stayed or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: at T=16, freeway 5,6,7 have collision, but we are at y=9.\n\nBut suppose we were at y=8 at T=16, it would be bad, but we are at y=8 only at T=15, not at T=16.\n\nAt T=15, y=8 is safe.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we can reach earlier, but from T=13 to T=16 is earliest possible.\n\nStart at T=13, after one action at T=13, to y=7 at T=14.\n\nAfter two actions, to y=8 at T=15? After first action, y=7 at T=14; after second action at T=14, to y=8 at T=15; after third action at T=15, to y=9 at T=16.\n\nSo cannot reach before T=16.\n\nThus minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, collision at T=16, but we are not on them.\n\nNow, but the player is at (0,y), and cars are on freeways, so only when y between 1 and 8.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check for y=7 at T=16, just to see.\n\nAt T=16, freeway 7: for first car, τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, T-13=3, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n-47 + 12*3 = -47 + 36 = -11\n\nh + s(T-13) = -36 + 36 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], which includes 0? -11 to 0, so x=0 is included, since 0 is the endpoint.\n\nNow, is 0 included? The span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], and for right-moving, it's inclusive I assume.\n\nThe inequality: τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT\n\nAt T=16, ΔT=3, τ + sΔT = -47 + 36 = -11 ≤ 0\n\nh + sΔT = -36 + 36 = 0 ≤ 0, which is true.\n\nSo yes, 0 is in [-11,0], so collision if on freeway 7 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in our path, we are not on freeway 7 at T=16; we are on y=9.\n\nAt T=16, we are on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8 at T=14: at T=14, freeway 8 first car: τ=-23, h=-12, s=12, ΔT=1, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], includes 0.\n\nSo if on y=8 at T=14, collision.\n\nBut we were not.\n\nIn our path, we were on y=8 at T=15, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, with actions U, U, U.\n\nBut the answer format should be for each turn.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo for H=3, actions at t=13,14,15.\n\na_{13}=U, a_{14}=U, a_{15}=U\n\nAnd we reach at t=16.\n\nBut the sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: a13, t=1: a14, t=2: a15.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the problem, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so H=3.\n\nBut is there a reason to do differently? For example, if we go to y=5 or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSuppose at T=13, we go down to y=5, then we need to go up more, which takes at least 4 turns: to y=5, then to y=6,7,8,9 or something, worse.\n\nOr stay, then go up, same or worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nPerhaps to avoid y=6 at T=16, but we are not there.\n\nSo I think H=3 is achievable.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,6) at turn t1=13.\n\nAfter action U at t=13, position at t=14 is (0,7)\n\nThen U at t=14, position at t=15 is (0,8)\n\nThen U at t=15, position at t=16 is (0,9)\n\nAt each turn, the position during the turn:\n\n- At turn t=13: position (0,6), freeway 6, no collision as above.\n\n- At turn t=14: position (0,7), freeway 7, at t=14, no collision.\n\n- At turn t=15: position (0,8), freeway 8, at t=15, no collision.\n\n- Then at turn t=16: position (0,9), no freeway, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t1=13.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be boxed.\n\nAlso, H is 3.\n\nBut the answer is the sequence.\n\nNow, but I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there is a path with H=2? Impossible, since from y=6 to y=9 in two steps: even if we go up both, y=7 then y=8, not y=9. After two actions: from t=13, action U to y=7 at t=14; action U at t=14 to y=8 at t=15. Still y=8, not 9. Need third action to reach y=9. So minimal H=3.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is three Ups.\n\nSo answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn 13 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway (y_T between 1 and 8) and x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n- Based on the car states at turn 13 and their movement rules (all cars are right-moving), the dangerous times for each freeway are:\n  - Freeway 1: Collision at turns 21, 22, 23, 24.\n  - Freeway 5: Collision at turn 16.\n  - Freeway 6: Collision at turn 16.\n  - Freeway 7: Collision at turn 16.\n  - Freeway 8: Collision at turn 14.\n  - Freeways 2, 3, 4: No collision at any turn.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in Minimal Turns:\n- The minimal number of turns required to move from y=6 to y=9 is 3, as each action changes y by at most ±1.\n- Sequence of actions:\n  - At turn 13: Action U (move up to y=7 at turn 14).\n    - Position at turn 13: y=6 (freeway 6).\n    - Freeway 6 at turn 13: Cars spans are [-47, -36] and [25, 36]; x=0 not in span, no collision.\n  - At turn 14: Action U (move up to y=8 at turn 15).\n    - Position at turn 14: y=7 (freeway 7).\n    - Freeway 7 at turn 14: Cars spans are [-35, -24] and [37, 48]; x=0 not in span, no collision.\n  - At turn 15: Action U (move up to y=9 at turn 16).\n    - Position at turn 15: y=8 (freeway 8).\n    - Freeway 8 at turn 15: Cars spans are [1, 12] and [49, 60]; x=0 not in span, no collision.\n- At turn 16: Position is (0, 9), which is not a freeway, so no collision possible. Goal reached.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 3 turns (H=3) with no collisions. No shorter path is possible, as moving from y=6 to y=9 requires at least 3 upward moves.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 13: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\, U \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway (y_T from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the player's x-coordinate).\n\nNote: The player updates position at the end of the turn. So at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action (U, D, S) to move to y_{T+1}. The collision check for the player at turn T is only for the freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso note: The cars are moving. For a car on freeway i, we are given its state at turn t1=14.\n\nWe need to compute the car's span at any future turn T (relative to t1=14) by:\n  T_rel = T - 14\n\nFor a left-moving car (but note: in the table, direction is given as 'right' or 'left'? Actually, the update rules are given for left-moving and right-moving. In the car state table, we have direction: 'right' means right-moving? Yes.\n\nSo for a car with direction 'right':\n  At turn T (absolute) = 14 + T_rel, the car's span is [tau + s * T_rel, h + s * T_rel]   (because at T=14: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*0, h+s*0] = [tau, h])\n\nWait, the initial state at t1=14 is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front? The update rule for right-moving: \n  Initial span at t1: [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table: \n  For example, freeway 1: (-21, -32, right, 3). \n  Here, head = -21, tail = -32? But for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost (greater x) and tail the leftmost? \n\nBut -21 > -32, so head=-21 (rightmost) and tail=-32 (leftmost). So at t1=14, the car is from x=-32 to x=-21. Then at a future turn T, the car will be at:\n  [ -32 + 3*(T-14), -21 + 3*(T-14) ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule for left-moving says:\n  Initial: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nand note that in the representation for left-moving, we have head and tail? But the table doesn't have left-moving cars in this state.\n\nIn the given car state, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: right\nFreeway 2: right\nFreeway 3: right\nFreeway 4: right\nFreeway 5: two cars, both right\nFreeway 6: two cars, both right\nFreeway 7: two cars, both right\nFreeway 8: two cars, both right\n\nSo all are right-moving. Therefore, for any car with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, right, s) at turn 14, at turn T (>=14) the car is at:\n  [tau + s*(T-14), h + s*(T-14)]\n\nCollision on freeway i at turn T happens if the player is on y_T = i and the car on that freeway (if any) has a span that includes 0. Since there might be multiple cars on a freeway, we must check every car on that freeway.\n\nImportant: The player is only on one freeway at a time. We start at y=7 (freeway 7? Actually, the freeways are for y=1 to 8, and the player at y=7 is on freeway 7. The goal is y=9, which is above freeway 8, so we must move up from 7 to 8 and then to 9.\n\nBut note: the grid is from y=0 to y=9. The freeways are at y=1 to 8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no freeways? Therefore, no collision at y=0 or y=9.\n\nOur current state: \n  Turn 14: player at (0,7). \n\nWe need to get to (0,9). The minimal number of moves? Since we are at 7, we need to go up 2 steps. But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 7 and 8 when we are on them.\n\nHowever, we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision? But we want minimal turns. So ideally we want to go up at every step: U, U -> 2 turns. But we must check if we collide on freeway 7 at turn 14? and on freeway 8 at turn 15.\n\nBut note: at turn 14, we are at y=7. We are going to choose an action for turn 14 that will determine y15.\n\nBut first, we must check: at turn 14, is the player colliding at y=7? \n  We are at (0,7) at turn 14. Check freeway 7 at turn 14.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars: \n  car1: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> at turn 14: [ -35 + 12*(0), -24 + 12*(0) ] = [-35, -24] -> does it include 0? 0 is not between -35 and -24? (since -35<=0<=-24? no, because 0 is greater than -24). So no.\n  car2: (48, 37, right, 12) -> [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48]. \n\nSo at turn 14, no collision on freeway 7.\n\nNow, we plan to move up to y=8 at turn 15. Then at turn 15, we are at y=8. Then we can move up to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut we must check freeway 8 at turn 15? and also note: when we are at turn 15, we are on freeway 8? and then we choose an action to move to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nSo at turn 15, we are at y=8. Check freeway 8 at turn 15.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars at turn 14:\n  car1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at turn 15 (T=15, T_rel=1): \n        [ -11 + 12*1, 0 + 12*1 ] = [1, 12] -> does it include 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> no.\n  car2: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 15, no collision on freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n  Turn 14: U -> move to y=8 at turn 15? \n      Actually: \n          At turn 14: we are at y=7. We choose action U -> then y15 = 7+1 = 8.\n      Then at turn 15: we are at y=8. Then we choose action U -> y16 = 8+1 = 9 -> goal.\n\nSo in 2 moves we are done.\n\nBut wait: what about the other freeways? We are only on freeway 7 at turn 14 and freeway 8 at turn 15. We don't go to other freeways.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway 8 at turn 15: \n  car1: [ -11 + 12*(15-14) = -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> does not include 0? Correct.\n\nBut wait: the first car on freeway 8 at turn 14 is (0, -11, right, 12). \n  Head=0, tail=-11? Then for a right-moving car, the head is the right end? So the car is from tail=-11 to head=0? \n  So at turn 14: the car is at [-11,0]? \n  Then at turn 15: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> correct.\n\nBut note: at turn 14, the car on freeway 8 at x=0 is present? Because the span is [-11,0] which includes 0? \n  So at turn 14, if the player were on freeway 8, then they would collide. But at turn 14, the player is on freeway 7, not 8.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nHowever, let me check freeway 8 at turn 14 for completeness: \n  car1: [ -11, 0] -> includes 0? Yes. But we are not on freeway 8 at turn 14, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, and the actions are U at turn 14 and U at turn 15.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1, so two actions: t=0 (turn 14) and t=1 (turn 15).\n\nBut wait, the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\nSo:\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n\nBut let me check if there is any danger in moving up to 8 at turn15? We just checked freeway8 at turn15: safe.\n\nBut wait, what about the other car on freeway8 at turn15? The second car: (48,37,right,12) at turn14 -> at turn15: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway7 at turn15? We don't need to because at turn15 we are at y=8, not 7. However, for completeness: \n  Freeway7 at turn15: \n    car1: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12] -> doesn't include 0.\n    car2: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait, what if we consider that at turn14 we are at y=7 and we are going to move to y=8 at turn15. And at turn15 we are at y=8. Then we move to y=9 at turn16. But note that at turn16, we are at y=9 which is not a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". So H=2.\n\nBut wait: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? So two actions: at turn14 and turn15.\n\nHowever, note that after the second action (at turn15) we move to y=9 at turn16? \n  Turn14: action U -> then at turn15: we are at y=8 (because we moved at the end of turn14 to y=8).\n  Turn15: action U -> then at turn16: we are at y=9.\n\nSo we reach the goal at turn16? But the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H? Because:\n  t1: we start at y_{t1}=7, then we take H actions: \n      at t1: action0 -> y_{t1+1}\n      ...\n      at t1+H-1: action_{H-1} -> y_{t1+H}\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nActually, the sequence is indexed t=0 to H-1, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and the state after that action is y_{t1+H}. But the problem says: \"to reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\nLet me read carefully: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. The problem says: \n  \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: \n  At turn t1 (current turn) we are at y_{t1}=7.\n  We take an action at turn t1: then at the next turn (t1+1) we are at y_{t1+1}.\n  Similarly, after H actions (at turn t1+H-1) we take the last action, and then the state becomes y_{t1+H}. But the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut note: the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo after the action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. \n\nWe start at turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=7. \nThen we take an action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> then we get y_{t1+1} = 7 + Delta y_{t1}.\nThen we take a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta y_{t1+1}\n...\nWe take the last action at turn t1+H-1 -> then we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" ? \n\nWait, the problem says: \n  \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut that would mean that after H-1 actions we are at 9? \n\nActually, the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1 (so H actions). The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and it produces the state at turn t1+H. But the problem says we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nThat doesn't match because at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y_{t1+H-1}, and then we take an action to get to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem states: \n  \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo that means we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So if we are already at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is ambiguous. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, we write the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut when do we reach? After the last action, we are at turn t1+H and we are at y_{t1+H}=9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" — wait, I think I misread. \n\nActually, in the task section: \n  \"Find a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIt says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nBut note: the index of the state: \n  At the beginning of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}.\n  Then we take an action at turn t1 and move to y_{t1+1} at the beginning of turn t1+1? \n\nBut actually, the state is updated at the end of the turn? \n\nThe problem says: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nSo at the end of turn t, we are at y_{t+1}. \n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=7. \nAfter taking action at turn t1, at the end of turn t1 (which is the beginning of turn t1+1) we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn. The goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" — and we are at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? \n\nBut note the collision condition: collision occurs at turn T if at that turn (the beginning of the turn?) the player is on a freeway and the car's span at turn T includes 0.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn T is what matters for collision and also for the goal.\n\nTherefore, we want the player to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. Why? \n\nBecause: \n  - At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=7 (beginning).\n  - We take action a_{t1} -> then at the beginning of turn t1+1: we are at y_{t1+1}.\n  - ... \n  - We take action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then at the beginning of turn t1+H: we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \n  \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait, that would be at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence requires H actions, so we would have taken H-1 actions to get to that state? \n\nThis is a key point.\n\nLet me parse the problem statement again:\n\n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand the goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo if we set H=1: \n  Then we have one action: a_{t1} (t=0). \n  Then we want y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=9? But we start at 7 -> not 9.\n\nIf H=2: \n  Then we have two actions: at t1 and t1+1.\n  Then we want y_{t1+2-1}=y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nBut if we take two actions, then at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}. Then we take an action at turn t1+1 and move to y_{t1+2}. But the condition is y_{t1+1}=9. \n\nSo that means we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+1. Then we take an action at turn t1+1? But that action might move us away? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9), so we don't care after? \n\nHowever, the problem says we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut we start at turn t1 at y=7. We want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+? \n\nWith two moves: \n  Action at turn t1: U -> then at the beginning of turn t1+1: y=8.\n  Then action at turn t1+1: U -> then at the beginning of turn t1+2: y=9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2. \n\nBut the condition says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nIf we set H=3, then we want y_{t1+3-1}=y_{t1+2}=9 -> that matches. \n\nBut then we would have to take 3 actions? \n\nBut we only need two actions to get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2. \n\nSo for H=3, we take actions at turn t1, t1+1, t1+2. But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2. Then we take an action at turn t1+2? But that might move us away? \n\nThe problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9, but we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2, so we have reached. However, the sequence must be of H actions. \n\nBut if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2, we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the sequence for H=3 requires an action at turn t1+2. \n\nSo we can do: \n  Turn t1: U\n  Turn t1+1: U\n  Turn t1+2: S (stay) -> but then we are still at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+3? \n\nBut the condition is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = t1+3-1 = t1+2 we must be at 9. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2, which is before we take the third action? \n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn t1+2, so we have achieved the goal at that turn. Why take a third action? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2, we only need two actions: \n  Action at turn t1: U -> then at turn t1+1: we are at 8 (beginning).\n  Action at turn t1+1: U -> then at turn t1+2: we are at 9 (beginning).\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2. \n\nTo satisfy the condition: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n  So we set H-1 = 2? Then H=3. But then we have to write three actions? \n\nBut we have only taken two actions. The third action would be taken at turn t1+2, but we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2. \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1. So for H=3, we have t=0,1,2 -> actions at turn t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nBut we don't need the third action. \n\nThis suggests that the problem might mean: we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then we set H such that we take H actions and then at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding in the indexing. \n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand \n  \"minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: \n  After k actions, we are at the beginning of turn t1+k. \n  Why? \n      Start: turn t1, we are at y_{t1} (beginning).\n      After 0 actions: we are at turn t1, and we have not taken any action -> but the sequence starts at t=0, so we take an action at turn t1.\n      After taking the first action (at turn t1), we move to the beginning of turn t1+1 at y_{t1+1}.\n      After two actions: we are at the beginning of turn t1+2.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+2, we have taken two actions (at turn t1 and t1+1). \n\nThe number of actions is H, and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2, then we set t1+H-1 = t1+2 -> H-1=2 -> H=3. \n\nThat means we must have H=3, and then we have to show three actions. But the third action is taken at turn t1+2, and we are already at 9 at the beginning of that turn. So we can choose any action (S, U, D) but we are at 9, so if we choose U, we go to 10 which is not allowed? The update rule says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. \n\nSo we cannot go above 9. \n\nTherefore, if we are at 9 and we choose U, then y_{t+1}=min(9+1,9)=9? But the rule says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then it is clamped to [0,9]? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". It doesn't say it is clamped, but the movement is defined only for moves that keep it in [0,9]. \n\nBut if we are at 9 and we choose U, then we try to go to 10, which is not allowed? So we must stay at 9. \n\nThe update rule: \n  If a_t = U, then y_{t+1}=y_t+1, but then it must be in [0,9]. So if y_t=9, then y_{t+1} would be 10 -> invalid. \n\nTherefore, we cannot choose U when at 9. Similarly, we cannot choose D at 0. \n\nSo if we are at 9, we must choose S (stay). \n\nTherefore, for H=3, we would do:\n  Turn t1: U\n  Turn t1+1: U\n  Turn t1+2: S\n\nThen at the beginning of turn t1+3: we are still at 9? But we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = t1+3-1 = t1+2. \n\nAt the beginning of turn t1+2: we are at 9 (because the last action we took was at turn t1+1: U, which moved us from 8 to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2). \n\nSo we are at 9 at turn t1+2 (which is H-1=3-1=2, so t1+2). \n\nBut then why do we need the third action (S at turn t1+2)? The problem requires H actions. \n\nSo with H=3, we are at 9 at turn t1+2 (the beginning) and then we take an action S at turn t1+2 to stay at 9 for the next turn. \n\nBut the condition is only that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn t1+2). The condition doesn't require us to stay. \n\nHowever, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and then the goal is achieved. So once we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2, we have reached. \n\nBut the sequence requires H=3 actions. \n\nThis is inefficient because we are taking an extra action. \n\nAlternatively, we can interpret the problem as: we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then we would set H=2, and then we are at 9 at turn t1+2. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me see the example in the problem? There isn't one. \n\nGiven the car state, and the minimal moves, it's clear that we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+2 with two actions. \n\nBut to match the problem's condition, we have to set H=3. \n\nThis seems odd. \n\nPerhaps there is a typo in the problem. \n\nAnother possibility: the index in the state is off by one. \n\nLet me assume that the problem means we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then we want to minimize H such that we take H actions and end up at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nThen for our case, H=2, and the actions are:\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n\nAnd then at turn 16 (beginning) we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which would be y_{14+2-1}=y_{15}=9. \n\nBut with two actions, at the beginning of turn 15 we are at 8, and at the beginning of turn 16 we are at 9. \n\nSo y_{15}=8, y_{16}=9. \n\nSo if the problem requires y_{15}=9, then we are not there. \n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn 15? \n\nHow can we be at 9 at the beginning of turn 15? \n  We start at turn 14 at y=7. \n  We take one action at turn 14: U -> then at turn 15 we are at 8, not 9.\n  If we take a double move? But we can only move one step per turn. \n\nSo it is impossible to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 15. \n\nThe next chance is turn 16: then we need two actions (H=2) to get from 7 to 9 in two steps, arriving at turn 16.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9, which for H=2 would be y_{14+2-1}=y_{15}=9. But we are at 8 at turn 15. \n\nSo that condition is not met. \n\nWith H=3, we require y_{14+3-1}=y_{16}=9. \n  How to achieve that? \n      Turn14: action0 -> turn15: y15 = 7 + action0 (if U then 8, if D then 6, if S then 7)\n      Turn15: action1 -> turn16: y16 = y15 + action1\n      Turn16: action2 -> turn17: y17 = y16 + action2\n\n  We want y16=9.\n\n  So we need to get from 7 to 9 in two actions: \n        action0: U -> y15=8\n        action1: U -> y16=9\n        Then action2 can be S (since we are at 9 at the beginning of turn16, and we take action2 at turn16 to stay at 9 for turn17).\n\n  But then at the beginning of turn16, we are at 9, which satisfies y_{t1+H-1}=y_{14+3-1}=y_{16}=9.\n\n  And the sequence has three actions.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n  At turn15: we need to be at 9. But from 7, we can only get to 8 at turn15 (by U at turn14). \n  We cannot get to 9 at turn15.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at 9 is at turn16.\n\nTherefore, with H=3, we have y16=9.\n\nAnd we must show three actions.\n\nBut note: the third action at turn16 is necessary to meet the sequence length, but it doesn't change the fact that we are at 9 at turn16.\n\nAnd collision checks? \n  We need to check for each turn from 14 to 16 (the beginning of turn14, turn15, turn16) for collision? \n      But at turn16, we are at y=9 -> not a freeway, so no collision.\n\n  Turn14: y=7 -> freeway7: we checked: safe.\n  Turn15: y=8 -> freeway8: we checked at turn15: car1: [1,12] -> safe, car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n\n  Also, during the actions, we are not on freeway9, so no issue.\n\nBut what about the actions themselves? The collision condition is only at the beginning of the turn for the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n  Turn14: U\n  Turn15: U\n  Turn16: S   (because we are at 9 at the beginning of turn16, and we must stay)\n\nBut we could also do U at turn16? But that would try to go to 10, which is not allowed. The problem says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. How is that enforced? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". It doesn't specify what happens if we try to go out of bounds. \n\nTo be safe, we should stay.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut is there a possibility to do it in fewer than 3 actions? No, because we cannot be at 9 at turn15.\n\nAlternatively, if we could move faster, but the moves are only +1, -1, 0.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car states: are there any cars that might appear at turn16 on freeway9? No, because there is no freeway9.\n\nAnd at turn16, we are at y=9, so no freeway.\n\nBut what about during the moves? The only freeways we are on are 7 and 8.\n\nWe've checked turn14 (y=7) and turn15 (y=8).\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut wait, the car state for freeway8 at turn16? \n  We are at turn16: we are at y=9, so not on freeway8. But if we were on freeway8 at turn16, we would need to check. \n  But we are not.\n\nBut for completeness, freeway8 at turn16: \n  car1: (0,-11,right,12) at turn14: \n        turn16: T_rel=2 -> [ -11+12*2, 0+12*2] = [13,24] -> doesn't include 0.\n  car2: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo even if we were on freeway8 at turn16, it would be safe. But we are not.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway8 at turn14 that covers x=0: the first car at turn14 is [ -11,0] -> includes 0. \n  But at turn14, we are not on freeway8, we are on freeway7.\n\nSo the final answer is three turns.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found H=3.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 at turn16 with two actions? Yes, but then we would be at 9 at turn16, and the condition requires that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n  For two actions: H=2, then we want y_{14+2-1}=y_{15}=9 -> but we are at 8 at turn15, not 9.\n\nSo we need H=3.\n\nAlternatively, if we could be at 9 at turn15, we would need H=2: \n  then y_{14+2-1}=y_{15}=9 -> then we would be done.\n\nBut we cannot.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at 9 earlier by a different route? For example, if we move down first? \n  That would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we move down to 6, then up to 7, then up to 8, then up to 9 -> that would be 4 turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the direct up-up is the fastest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so three turns: 14,15,16.\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the third action? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we must have three actions.\n\nWe must have an action for turn16.\n\nAnd at turn16, we are at y=9, so we must choose S (stay) to remain at 9.\n\nWe cannot choose U or D.\n\nSo S is the only choice.\n\nTherefore, this is the minimal and safe sequence.\n\nBut what about the cars on freeway7 and freeway8 at other turns? We are only on freeway7 at turn14 and freeway8 at turn15.\n\nWe've checked those.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway8 at turn15 is [1,12] and [49,60] -> safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are not on them, so no need.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,8) at turn t1 = 15. I need to get to (0,9) with minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The goal is to reach y=9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=8 and going to y=9, moving up seems direct, but I have to avoid the cars on the freeways when I'm on them.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on direction and speed.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you're not on the new row until the next turn. So if you move at turn T, you're still on y_T for collision check at turn T, and you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn this case, since we're going to y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so no cars on y=9. So once we reach y=9, we're safe. But to reach it, we need to be at position (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe position is (x,y), but x is always 0 for the player, I think. The player is at (0,y_t) always, since it's moving vertically, I assume. The grid is 2D, but the player only moves vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, so collisions depend on the x-position, but the player is always at x=0, so we care about whether 0 is in the car's span at the time.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nSpan is defined with head and tail. For left-moving, span is [h, τ] which might be decreasing, and for right-moving, it's [τ, h] increasing? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. Since it's left-moving, h and τ decrease over time.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h], I think? No, the table says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3). Direction right, so I think for right-moving cars, head is the front when moving right, so if direction is right, head should be greater than tail? But here head is -18, tail is -29, and direction right, but -18 > -29, so moving right, head is at -18, tail at -29? That seems odd because usually we think of increasing x.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of position.\n\nLet me define for a car, at time t, the span is the interval it occupies.\n\nFor a right-moving car with speed s, at time t, the position of head and tail.\n\nGiven at time t1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf d is right, then as time increases, both head and tail increase by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, if d is left, both decrease.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's left-moving, and head and tail decrease, so if at t1, head is h, tail is τ, with h > τ? For left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the left, decreasing.\n\nIn the example, freeway 1: head -18, tail -29, direction right.\n\n-18 > -29, so if direction right, it's moving to the right, so at t1, head at -18, tail at -29, so the car is from x=-29 to x=-18? But tail should be behind, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, I think.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3), so head -18, tail -29, since -18 > -29, and direction right, so the car is from x=-29 to x=-18, and moving right, so at time T, positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head and tail would be such that head < tail or something.\n\nBut in the table, all cars here are right-moving, I think, except let's see.\n\nFreeway 5: (-12,-23,right,12), so head -12, tail -23, direction right, so head > tail.\n\nAnother one: (60,49,right,12), head 60, tail 49, 60>49, so tail at 49, head at 60, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, all seem consistent.\n\nNow for collision: at turn T, for freeway k, if the player is on y=k, then if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nThe span at time T for a car: for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? From the update rule.\n\nFrom the text: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, at t1, head h, tail τ, with h > τ, so Span(t1) = [τ, h], since τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving, I think.\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving? Let me check the table.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: both right\n\n6: both right\n\n7: both right\n\n8: both right, and direction is right for all.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if y_T = k and 0 is in [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for some car on freeway k.\n\nNow t1 = 15, current turn.\n\nPlayer at (0,8), so y=8.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 1, since from 8 to 9, one up move.\n\nBut we need to check if we can move up immediately without collision.\n\nAt turn t1=15, player is on y=8.\n\nFreeway y=8 has cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head 12, tail 1, direction right, speed 12.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-15), h + s(T-15)] = [1 + 12(T-15), 12 + 12(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head 60, tail 49, speed 12, span [49 + 12(T-15), 60 + 12(T-15)]\n\nNow at turn T=15, for freeway 8:\n\nFirst car span: [1 + 12(0), 12 + 12(0)] = [1,12]\n\nSecond car: [49 + 0, 60 + 0] = [49,60]\n\nIs 0 in [1,12]? No, 1 to 12, 0 not included.\n\n0 in [49,60]? No.\n\nSo at turn 15, on freeway 8, no collision since 0 not in any span.\n\nPlayer can choose to move.\n\nIf we move up at turn 15, a_{15} = U, then y_{16} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nBut at turn 15, we are still on y=8, and we perform action, then move to y_{16}=9.\n\nThe collision is checked at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nAt turn 15, we are on y=8, and as above, no collision.\n\nThen we move to y=9 at turn 16, and since y=9 has no cars, we are safe.\n\nH=1, sequence: at turn t1=15, action U.\n\nThen at turn 16, position (0,9), done.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nTurn t1=15: player at (0,8), on freeway 8.\n\nCheck cars on freeway 8 at T=15:\n\nFirst car: span [1,12], 0 not in it.\n\nSecond car: [49,60], 0 not in it.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nAction U: move up to y=9 at next turn.\n\nAt turn 16, player at (0,9), not on any freeway, so no collision, and we reached the goal.\n\nMinimal H=1.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with one move, we do.\n\nBut let me check if there are any issues.\n\nThe car on freeway 8 with (12,1,right,12), at T=15, [1,12], not including 0.\n\nSince speed is 12, at T=16, span would be [1+12(1), 12+12(1)] = [13,24], even farther.\n\nSimilarly, other car [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], no issue.\n\nAnd at turn 15, we are safe to be there.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if we stay or something, but moving up directly seems fine.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, but since we are only on y=8 at turn 15, and moving directly to y=9, we don't go to other rows.\n\nSo H=1 should work.\n\nBut why is there information about other freeways? Maybe for other actions, but here we don't need.\n\nPerhaps I misread the collision condition.\n\nAnother thing: when you move, you are not on the new row until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 15, we are on y=8, check collision.\n\nThen after action, at turn 16, we are on y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, it's the goal, so no car.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt t1=15, τ=1, h=12 for first car, so [1,12]\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, second car [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nAnd since we leave immediately, no problem.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 15, if we had to stay or something, but we don't.\n\nPerhaps the player can only move to adjacent y, which we are doing.\n\nAnother point: y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, safe.\n\nSo minimal H is 1.\n\nBut why are there other freeways listed? Maybe if we start from lower, but here we are at y=8.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be for turn t1=15, action U.\n\nThen done.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason we cannot move up immediately.\n\nFor example, if at turn 15, on y=8, there was a car at 0, but there isn't.\n\nPerhaps for future turns, but we are not staying.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut here, at turn T=15, we are on y=8, and moving to y=9, so at turn T=15, we are only concerned with freeway 8, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 16, we are on y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 7 or others, but we never go there.\n\nPerhaps to be thorough, but I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and here H=1.\n\nBut let me see the car state for other freeways; maybe there is a reason we need to wait, but I don't see.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 has cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt T=15, first car: τ=-23, h=-12, span [ -23 +12(0), -12+12(0)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 same, etc.\n\nAll seem fine, but we are not on them.\n\nOnly at start we are on y=8.\n\nPerhaps if we move down, but why would we?\n\nSo I think moving up immediately is safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the position.\n\nPlayer at (0,8) at turn 15.\n\nAfter action U at turn 15, position at turn 16 is (0,9).\n\nAnd no collision during the process.\n\nThe collision is only checked when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn 15, on y=8, no collision.\n\nAt turn 16, on y=9, no freeway, so no collision check or always safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action at turn 15: U.\n\nSequence: Turn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nBut the answer format should be like that.\n\nBut in the sequence, it says {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for H=1, only t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_{15}\n\nSo Turn t1: a_{t1} which is U.\n\nThen done.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it as per format.\n\nMaybe there is a mistake.\n\nAnother thought: the car on freeway 8 with (12,1,right,12), at T=15, [1,12], but x=0, and 0 is not in [1,12] since 1 to 12, 0 is less than 1, so not included.\n\nSimilarly, if it was [0, something], but it's not.\n\nUnless the span includes the endpoints? Probably, but 0 is not equal to 1 or 12.\n\nFor example, if span was [0,10], then 0 is included, collision.\n\nBut here not.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for turn 15, if we stay, but no need.\n\nSo I believe H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me see why other freeways are given; maybe if we start from lower, but here y=8.\n\nPerhaps the player needs to go through other rows if direct is not safe, but here it is safe.\n\nAnother point: at turn 15, position (0,8), and we can move to (0,9) in one turn.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is just one action: at turn 15, U.\n\nSo answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAnd since H=1, only one turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's for t from 0 to H-1, so only t=0.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider if we had to go through y=7 or something, but no need.\n\nSuppose we couldn't move up immediately, but we can.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (12,1,right,12), head 12, tail 1, so at T=15, span [1,12], x=0 not in.\n\nBut 1 is the tail, 12 head, so positions from 1 to 12 inclusive, I assume, so x=0 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the direction: right, so moving right, at T=15, it's at [1,12], and since speed 12, moving fast.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 15, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 are:\n- Car 1: head = 12, tail = 1, direction = right, speed = 12\n- Car 2: head = 60, tail = 49, direction = right, speed = 12\n\nThe span of each car at turn \\(T\\) is calculated as \\([\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\\) for right-moving cars.\n\nAt turn \\(T = 15\\):\n- Car 1 span: \\([1 + 12(15 - 15), 12 + 12(15 - 15)] = [1, 12]\\)\n- Car 2 span: \\([49 + 12(15 - 15), 60 + 12(15 - 15)] = [49, 60]\\)\n\nThe player's position is \\(x = 0\\). Since 0 is not in \\([1, 12]\\) or \\([49, 60]\\), there is no collision at turn 15.\n\nThe player can move up (U) at turn 15. After this action, at turn 16, the player's position is \\(y_{16} = y_{15} + \\Delta y_{15} = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nAt turn 16, the player is at (0, 9), which is not a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision check is needed, and the goal is reached.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 1, and the sequence consists of a single action at turn 15.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\n}",
