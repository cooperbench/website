From (4,3), we can move directly right to (5,3) to eat.\n2. The up path requires moving down to (5,3) from (5,4), which is less direct.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nAt turn 0, the best move is **Down (D)** to (3,2), initiating the optimal path to (5,3).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 0, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake is just a single segment at (3,3), so it's only the head. The head direction is left, which means it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Since it's a single segment, there's no body to worry about, and the tail is the same as the head right now.

But since we're at turn 0, life span 10 means they last until turn 10, I think. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, then turn 1 it becomes 9, and so on, disappearing when it reaches 0.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 1 \\):\n\n- **Snake Positions**: The snake is a single segment at `(3, 2)`, meaning it's just the head.\n- **Snake Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving **Down (D)**.\n- **Walls**: \n  - Border walls at `x=0`, `x=7`, `y=0`, `y=7`.\n  - Internal obstacle at `(5, 2)`.\n- **Food**:\n  - `(1, 1)`: Value `+1`, Life span `9`.\n  - `(5, 3)`: Value `+1`, Life span `9`.\n  - `(5, 6)`: Value `+1`, Life span `9`.\n  - `(3, 4)`: Value `+1`, Life span `10`.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nFrom `(3, 2)` with direction **D**, the snake can move:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: `(3, 1)`.\n   - Check: `y=1` is within bounds (not `y=0`), and `(3, 1)` is not an obstacle.\n   - Valid move.\n2. **Left (L)**: `(2, 2)`.\n   - Check: `x=2` is within bounds (not `x=0`), and `(2, 2)` is not an obstacle.\n   - Valid move.\n3. **Right (R)**: `(4, 2)`.\n   - Check: `x=4` is within bounds (not `x=7`), and `(4, 2)` is not an obstacle.\n   - Valid move.\n4. **Up (U)**: `(3, 3)`.\n   - This is the opposite of the current direction **D**, so it's **not allowed** (instant reverse).\n\nThus, valid immediate moves are **D**, **L**, or **R**.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nLet's look at the food positions relative to the snake's current position `(3, 2)`:\n\n1. `(1, 1)`:\n   - Distance: `|1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n2. `(5, 3)`:\n   - Distance: `|5-3| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n3. `(5, 6)`:\n   - Distance: `|5-3| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6`.\n4. `(3, 4)`:\n   - Distance: `|3-3| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2`.\n\nThe closest food is `(3, 4)` at distance `2`, but moving **Up (U)** is not allowed. The next closest are `(1, 1)` and `(5, 3)` at distance `3`.\n\n### Planning the Path\n\nGiven that we cannot move **Up (U)**, let's consider paths to `(5, 3)` and `(1, 1)`:\n\n1. **Path to `(5, 3)`**:\n   - Current: `(3, 2)`.\n   - Move **Right (R)** to `(4, 2)`.\n   - Then **Right (R)** to `(5, 2)` is invalid (obstacle at `(5, 2)`).\n   - Alternative: From `(4, 2)`, move **Up (U)** to `(4, 3)`.\n   - Then **Right (R)** to `(5, 3)` to eat.\n   - Total moves: 3 (`R`, `U`, `R`).\n\n2. **Path to `(1, 1)`**:\n   - Current: `(3, 2)`.\n   - Move **Left (L)** to `(2, 2)`.\n   - Then **Left (L)** to `(1, 2)`.\n   - Then **Down (D)** to `(1, 1)` to eat.\n   - Total moves: 3 (`L`, `L`, `D`).\n\nBoth paths require 3 moves to reach the first food. However, after eating `(5, 3)`, the snake can potentially reach `(5, 6)` more easily, while after `(1, 1)`, reaching other foods is harder due to distance.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn \\( t_0 = 1 \\)\n\nGiven the above, the immediate action should start the path towards one of the closest foods. Since both `(5, 3)` and `(1, 1)` are equally distant, but `(5, 3)` allows for easier access to `(5, 6)` later, let's start moving towards `(5, 3)`.\n\nThe first move towards `(5, 3)` is **Right (R)** to `(4, 2)`.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\n- Moving **Right (R)** to `(4, 2)`:\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - No food at `(4, 2)`, so the snake remains length `1`.\n  - Next direction is **R**, allowing moves **U**, **D**, or **R** (not **L**).\n\nThis move is safe and aligns with the plan to reach `(5, 3)`.\n\n### Considering Previous Guidance\n\nThe previous thinking model at Turn \\( t_1 = 0 \\) suggested moving **Up (U)** from `(3, 3)` (initial position), but now the snake is at `(3, 2)` moving **D**. The previous plan is not directly applicable, but the strategy to prioritize reaching the closest food still holds.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the current state and the goal to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** towards `(5, 3)`.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

But since we're at turn 0, life span 10 means they last until turn 10, I think. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, then turn 1 it becomes 9, and so on, disappearing when it reaches 0.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, cells with x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6 are inside, but (5,2) is an obstacle, so I can't go there.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,4), body (5,3). So it's vertical, head above body. Direction Up, so moving north.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,1) - bottom-left, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 10? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 5, life span 5 means it has 5 turns left, including turn 5, so it disappears after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn 5, life span 5: after turn 5, countdown to 4; after turn 6, to 3; ... after turn 9, to 0; so it disappears before turn 10? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now it's gone.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+N. Since countdown decreases every turn, at turn t, countdown is N; after turn t, it becomes N-1; ... when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The input says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> For food at (1,1): life span 5 at turn 5. So after 5 turns, meaning after turn 10? Let's see the countdown.\n> \n> At turn 5, countdown = 5.\n> \n> After turn 5 is executed, countdown becomes 4 (before turn 6).\n> \n> After turn 6, countdown 3, and so on.\n> \n> After turn 9, countdown 0, so before turn 10, it disappears. So it exists from turn 5 to turn 9 inclusive? Turn 5: countdown 5, present; turn 6: countdown 4, present; ... turn 9: countdown 1, present; at the start of turn 10, countdown 0, disappears.

Let's see.\n> \n> Rule: deadly collisions include body collision, but you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move away.\n> \n> Here, the tail is at (5,3). If I move down to (5,3), since it's the tail, and after the move, the head moves to (5,3), and the tail would have moved from (5,3), but where? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: [ (5,4) head, (5,3) tail ]\n> \n> If head moves to a new cell, say to (5,5) for example.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at (5,5), and the body segment that was at (5,4) moves to where? The tail was at (5,3), but when head moves, the segment that was head becomes body, and the tail stays or moves depending on eating.\n> \n> Rule: if not eating, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is removed.\n> \n> So after move, new head position is the moved-to cell, and the tail position is removed from the list.\n> \n> Specifically, for a move without eating: new head position, and the body list is the old body list minus the tail, plus the old head position as new body segment?

(5,3) has no food, I think. Food positions are given, (5,3) is snake body, not food.\n> \n> So if I move down to (5,3), I am moving to a cell that is currently tail, but after move, the tail was at (5,3), and head moves to (5,3), but then the new positions: head at (5,3), and the body is the old head at (5,4). So the cell (5,3) is now head, and (5,4) is body.

        "thinking": "Based on the provided guidance from the previous thinking model, the immediate action for the current turn \\( t_0 = 6 \\) should be to move **U (Up)** to (5,5), as this aligns with the plan to reach the time-sensitive food at (5,6) by the next turn (Turn 7). \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. **Current State**: Snake head at (4,4), direction L (Left), with food at (3,4) directly left and (5,6) above.\n2. **Previous Plan**: The thinking model at Turn 5 planned to move U to (5,5) at Turn 5, then U to (5,6) at Turn 6 to eat the food. However, the current state shows the snake is now at (4,4) with direction L, indicating the plan was adjusted (likely due to a missed turn or updated state). \n3. **Immediate Action**: Since the snake is now at (4,4) with direction L, the next step in the original plan (moving U to (5,5)) is no longer directly applicable. However, the priority remains to reach (5,6) before it disappears (by Turn 9). From (4,4), moving **U (Up)** to (4,5) is valid (not opposite to current direction L) and starts a path toward (5,6) (e.g., via (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6)).\n\nHowever, the snake's current direction is L (Left), and the head is at (4,4). Valid moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (4,5) – Valid (not opposite to L).\n- **D (Down)**: (4,3) – Invalid (opposite to current direction U, but current direction is L, so this is actually valid. Wait, no: \"No instant reverse\" means you cannot move opposite to the *last* direction. The last move was L, so opposite is R, which is forbidden. U/D are allowed.\n  \nGiven the confusion, let's clarify:\n- Current direction is L (Left), so the snake moved from (5,4) to (4,4) by going L. Thus, the next move cannot be R (Right), but U/D/L are allowed.\n- Moving **U (Up)** to (4,5) is safe and aligns with the goal of reaching (5,6) (next turn: (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6)).\n- Moving **L (Left)** to (3,4) would eat the food at (3,4) immediately, but the original plan prioritized (5,6) due to its shorter lifespan.\n\n**Final Decision**: Stick to the original plan's priority of securing (5,6) by moving toward it. From (4,4), moving **U (Up)** to (4,5) is the best step toward (5,5) and (5,6). \n\n\\boxed{U}",

Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 5, life span 5 means it has 5 turns left, including turn 5, so it disappears after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn 5, life span 5: after turn 5, countdown to 4; after turn 6, to 3; ... after turn 9, to 0; so it disappears before turn 10? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now it's gone.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+N. Since countdown decreases every turn, at turn t, countdown is N; after turn t, it becomes N-1; ... when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The input says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but avoiding (5,2).\n> \n> The snake is at positions: head at (4,5), body at (4,4). So, it's a short snake, only two segments long. The head direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food items are given with their positions, life span, and value. All values are +1, since it says \"value1\", etc., and from the context, positive food has value +1. Let me list them:\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 3, value 1\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 3, value 1\n> \n> - (3,4) with life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All are positive food, no negative food mentioned, so I don't have to worry about penalties for now.\n> \n> Current turn is t=7. I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. X from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,5), moving Up. Body at (4,4). Since the snake is moving Up, if it continues Up, it would go to (4,6). But y=6 is the top border? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is the top? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases upwards, x increases rightwards. Walls at y=0 (bottom), y=7 (top), x=0 (left), x=7 (right). So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), so if moving Up (increasing y), next position would be (4,6). y=6 is within 1 to 6, so it's playable, but y=6 is not the wall; y=7 is the wall, so (4,6) is fine.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints. Current direction is Up, so I cannot instantly reverse to Down on the next turn. So from current state, possible actions: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite to Up, so not allowed.\n> \n> Action choices for turn 7: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns, but since food life spans are short, I should consider which food to target.\n> \n> Food life spans: each has a life span decreasing each turn, including current turn. So at turn 7, life spans:\n> \n> - (1,1): life span 3, so disappears after 3 turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current turn. So if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N more turns starting from now.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\". So for food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear at turn T + L - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at the start of turn T, if a food has life span S, after the turn, countdown decreases by one. So if S is the life span at turn T, after turn T, it becomes S-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn 7, food at (1,1) has life span 3, meaning after 3 turns, it will be gone. So it can be eaten on turns 7,8,9, and disappears after turn 9 or at turn 10? Let's define.\n> \n> Typically, at the beginning of turn T, the food is present. If not eaten during T, at the end of turn, countdown decreases. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for simplicity, I think we can say that with life span S at turn T, it will disappear after S more turns, so last chance to eat it is on turn T + S - 1.\n> \n> In this case, turn 7, life span 3: so it can be eaten on turns 7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life span 3: can be eaten turns 7,8,9\n> \n> (3,4) life span 4: turns 7,8,9,10\n> \n> (5,1) life span 7: turns 7 to 13\n> \n> (6,3) life span 10: turns 7 to 16\n> \n> Now, snake is at (4,5) with head direction Up.\n> \n> I need to move to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible cells I can move to from current position.\n> \n> Current head: (4,5)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): but Down is opposite to current direction (U), so not allowed.

Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,6) is x=4,y=6, within 1-6, not a wall. Obstacle at (5,2), not here. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,5) head, (4,4) body. So (4,6) is empty. So safe to move to.\n> \n> - (3,5): x=3,y=5, within bounds, no wall, not obstacle, not snake, so safe.\n> \n> - (5,5): x=5,y=5, within bounds. Obstacle at (5,2), different y, so not affected.

(4,5) to (3,4): Δx=1, Δy=1, so Manhattan dist=2, but since we move one cell per turn, it takes 2 moves to reach, but we can be adjacent.\n> \n> (3,4) is at (3,4), head at (4,5). So from (4,5) to (3,4), I can move Left to (3,5) first, then Down to (3,4), or Down to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, but moving to body is not possible if it's occupied, but when I move, the snake moves, so let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 7, snake positions: head (4,5), body (4,4). If I move to a cell, the body follows.\n> \n> But (3,4) is a food position, and it's not occupied by snake now, since snake is at (4,5) and (4,4), so (3,4) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> (5,6) is at (5,6), head at (4,5), so |dx=1, dy=1|, dist=2.\n> \n> (3,4) at (3,4), head (4,5), dx=1, dy=1, dist=2.\n> \n> But (3,4) is directly adjacent diagonally, but since we can only move orthogonally, I need two moves to reach it.\n> \n> For example, from (4,5), I can go Left to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go Down to (3,4). Or I could go Down first to (4,4), but (4,4) is the current body position. When I move, if I go Down to (4,4), that would be moving into the body segment, which is deadly collision? No, let's see the rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> The tail segment is the last segment. Here, snake has two segments: head and one body, which is also the tail since it's the end.\n> \n> Positions: [(4,5), (4,4)] so head is (4,5), tail is (4,4).\n> \n> If I move Down to (4,4), that is moving into the tail cell.

Turn 7,8,9: three turns to move. But I need 7 steps, so cannot reach (1,1) in time. It will disappear after turn 9, so I cannot eat it.

So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but avoiding (5,2).\n> \n> The snake is at positions: head at (4,5), body at (4,4). So, it's a short snake, only two segments long. The head direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food items are given with their positions, life span, and value. All values are +1, since it says \"value1\", etc., and from the context, positive food has value +1. Let me list them:\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 3, value 1\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 3, value 1\n> \n> - (3,4) with life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All are positive food, no negative food mentioned, so I don't have to worry about penalties for now.\n> \n> Current turn is t=7. I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. X from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,5), moving Up. Body at (4,4). Since the snake is moving Up, if it continues Up, it would go to (4,6). But y=6 is the top border? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is the top? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases upwards, x increases rightwards. Walls at y=0 (bottom), y=7 (top), x=0 (left), x=7 (right). So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), so if moving Up (increasing y), next position would be (4,6). y=6 is within 1 to 6, so it's playable, but y=6 is not the wall; y=7 is the wall, so (4,6) is fine.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints. Current direction is Up, so I cannot instantly reverse to Down on the next turn. So from current state, possible actions: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite to Up, so not allowed.\n> \n> Action choices for turn 7: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns, but since food life spans are short, I should consider which food to target.\n> \n> Food life spans: each has a life span decreasing each turn, including current turn. So at turn 7, life spans:\n> \n> - (1,1): life span 3, so disappears after 3 turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current turn. So if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N more turns starting from now.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\". So for food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear at turn T + L - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at the start of turn T, if a food has life span S, after the turn, countdown decreases by one. So if S is the life span at turn T, after turn T, it becomes S-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn 7, food at (1,1) has life span 3, meaning after 3 turns, it will be gone. So it can be eaten on turns 7,8,9, and disappears after turn 9 or at turn 10? Let's define.\n> \n> Typically, at the beginning of turn T, the food is present. If not eaten during T, at the end of turn, countdown decreases. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for simplicity, I think we can say that with life span S at turn T, it will disappear after S more turns, so last chance to eat it is on turn T + S - 1.\n> \n> In this case, turn 7, life span 3: so it can be eaten on turns 7,8,9.

Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,6) is x=4,y=6, within 1-6, not a wall. Obstacle at (5,2), not here. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,5) head, (4,4) body. So (4,6) is empty.

If I move to a cell, the body follows.\n> \n> But (3,4) is a food position, and it's not occupied by snake now, since snake is at (4,5) and (4,4), so (3,4) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> (5,6) is at (5,6), head at (4,5), so |dx=1, dy=1|, dist=2.\n> \n> (3,4) at (3,4), head (4,5), dx=1, dy=1, dist=2.\n> \n> But (3,4) is directly adjacent diagonally, but since we can only move orthogonally, I need two moves to reach it.\n> \n> For example, from (4,5), I can go Left to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go Down to (3,4). Or I could go Down first to (4,4), but (4,4) is the current body position. When I move, if I go Down to (4,4), that would be moving into the body segment, which is deadly collision? No, let's see the rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Can move Right (R), Up (U), or Down (D).\n- **Food**: All food has life span 1 and will disappear after this turn. None are adjacent to the head, so no food can be eaten this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **Right (R) to (6,6)**:\n   - (6,6) is within bounds and not occupied by the snake or a wall.\n   - After moving, the snake will be at [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)].\n   - On the next turn (Turn 10), the only possible move is Down (D) to (6,5), as other directions are blocked by walls or the snake's body.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (5,5)**:\n   - (5,5) is within bounds and not occupied by the snake or a wall.\n   - After moving, the snake will be at [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6)].\n   - On the next turn (Turn 10), possible moves are Down (D) to (5,4), Left (L) to (4,5), or Right (R) to (6,5).\n\n3. **Up (U) to (5,7)**:\n   - (5,7) is a wall (y=7 is a border), so this move is invalid.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving **Right (R)** to (6,6) limits future moves, as the only possible move on Turn 10 is Down (D) to (6,5), which may lead to being cornered.\n- Moving **Down (D)** to (5,5) provides more flexibility for future moves, allowing the snake to explore more of the grid and avoid being trapped.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most flexible move is **Down (D)** to (5,5).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls are at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then (4,6), then (4,5). So the snake is three segments long: head, body, tail.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 1\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 2? Wait, no: the format is (x, y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the input: \" (1, 1, 1, 1) \" – it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" but lists tuples like (1,1,1,1). I think it's (x,y, value, life_span). In the description, it says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the state, it's given as (1,1,1,1) which might be a tuple of four numbers. Probably it's (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> Similarly: (3,4,2,1) – so (3,4) value 2, life span 1\n> \n> (5,1,5,1) – (5,1) value 5, life span 1\n> \n> (6,3,8,1) – (6,3) value 8, life span 1\n> \n> All food has life span 1? That means they disappear after this turn or next? Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t=9. So for food with life span 1, it will disappear after turn 9, meaning at the end of turn 9, it's gone? Or during turn 9?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone by turn t+N? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is N at the start of turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before or after the turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the beginning of turn t, if a food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including the current turn. So after L turns, at the start of turn t+L, it is removed.\n> \n> For example, life span 1 at turn t=9: it will disappear after turn 9, so it can be eaten on turn 9, but not on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 5 at (5,1): value 5, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 13? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Current turn t=9.\n> \n> Food at (1,1): value 1, life span 1 – so after turn 9, it disappears. Can be eaten on turn 9.\n> \n> (3,4): value 2? Wait, (3,4,2,1) – value 2, life span 1 – same, disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> (5,1,5,1) – value 5, life span 1? No: (5,1,5,1) – I think it's x,y,value,life_span, so (5,1) value 5, life span 1? But earlier it says \" (5, 1, 5, 1)\" so value 5, life span 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3,8,1) value 8, life span 1.\n> \n> All food has life span 1? That seems odd, but let's accept it.\n> \n> In the list: (1,1,1,1) , (3,4,2,1), (5,1,5,1), (6,3,8,1) – all life span 1, so all will disappear after this turn, turn 9.\n> \n> So if not eaten on turn 9, they are gone forever.\n> \n> But the snake can only eat on turn 9 if it moves to the food cell.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,6), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R (continue right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because that's opposite, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L (left) next turn.\n> \n> So possible actions: R, U, D.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5).\n> \n> So the cells: (5,6) head, (4,6) body, (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Food at: (1,1), (3,4), (5,1), (6,3)\n> \n> All with life span 1, so must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> But (5,1) is at (5,1), which is below, but there's an obstacle at (5,2), so (5,1) might be accessible? (5,1) is at y=1, x=5, and obstacle at (5,2), so to reach (5,1), I need to go down from above, but (5,2) is blocked, so I cannot go directly to (5,1) from north; I need to come from south or sides, but y=1 is the bottom wall, so only from north or east/west, but north is (5,2) which is obstacle, so (5,1) is inaccessible? Let's see.\n> \n> Grid rows and columns: y from 1 to 6, I think, with walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is the bottom row.\n> \n> Cell (5,1): x=5, y=1.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: north (5,2), south: but y=1, south would be y=0 which is wall, so no cell. West (4,1), east (6,1).\n> \n> But (5,2) is an obstacle, so from (5,1), it can be accessed from west (4,1) or east (6,1), since north is blocked and south is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, for the snake to reach (5,1), it needs to be at (4,1) or (6,1) and move to (5,1).\n> \n> But currently snake is at (5,6), which is far away.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,1) at bottom left, (3,4) around center, (6,3) near right.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,6), can move to:\n> \n> - R: (6,6) – is this safe? (6,6) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=6<7. Now, is there body? Snake body is (4,6) and (4,5), so (6,6) is empty. Also, no food there? Food is at (1,1),(3,4),(5,1),(6,3), not (6,6). So moving to (6,6) is safe, no collision.\n> \n> - U: up to (5,7)? But y=7 is wall, so (5,7) is invalid, cannot move there. Walls are at y=7, so y=7 is wall, so moving up from (5,6) to (5,7) is impossible, collision with wall. So U is not possible.\n> \n> - D: down to (5,5). Is (5,5) occupied? Snake body: positions are (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). So (5,5) is not occupied, and no wall, so it should be safe. Food? (5,5) not listed, so no food, just move.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,6), but (4,6) is the body segment, the first body part. Now, if I move to (4,6), head collides with body? But according to rules, when moving, the tail will move, so let's see.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, if I move left to (4,6), which is currently occupied by the body. But after the move, the tail will move away? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5).\n> \n> If I move head to (4,6), then the new positions: head at (4,6), and the body will follow: the segment that was at (4,6) moves to where the head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,6), which was previously occupied by the first body segment, then that segment must move to the next position.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,6)\n> \n> - Then the body segment that was at (4,6) must move to where? It was following head, but head is now at (4,6), so it should move to the next in line, but since head took its place, it needs to move to the position of the tail or something.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions.\n> \n> Current: segment 0: head at (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 1: body at (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 2: tail at (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head left to (4,6):\n> \n> New head position: (4,6)\n> \n> Now, segment 1 (which was at (4,6)) must move to where segment 0 was, but segment 0 is now at (4,6), so segment 1 should move to (5,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> Generally, when head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> So new head position is the move target.\n> \n> Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the previous state.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> New head: (4,6)  // moved from (5,6) to (4,6)\n> \n> Then segment 1: was at (4,6), but now that position is taken by head, so segment 1 must move to where segment 0 was, which is (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 2: was at (4,5), must move to where segment 1 was, which was (4,6), but (4,6) is now head, so it moves to (4,6)? No.\n> \n> Positions before move:\n> \n> - Seg0: (5,6)\n> \n> - Seg1: (4,6)\n> \n> - Seg2: (4,5)\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New seg0 (head): (4,6)  // from move\n> \n> - Then seg1: moves to previous position of seg0, which is (5,6)\n> \n> - Seg2: moves to previous position of seg1, which is (4,6)\n> \n> But (4,6) is now occupied by head, so seg2 moving to (4,6) would collide with head? But at that point, head is already there.\n> \n> In terms of collision, after all movements, if head is on the same cell as any body segment, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, after move:\n> \n> Head at (4,6)\n> \n> Seg1 at (5,6)\n> \n> Seg2 at (4,6)  // because it moves to previous seg1 position, which was (4,6)\n> \n> So now head and seg2 are both at (4,6), so collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,6) is invalid, collision with body.\n> \n> Since (4,6) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, the tail is at (4,5), not at (4,6). (4,6) is the body segment before tail.\n> \n> So moving to a cell that is the tail position is ok, because tail moves away.\n> \n> But moving to a non-tail body position causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, (4,6) is a body position, not tail, so moving there causes head to be on the same cell as that segment after move, but since the segment moves, it might be messy.\n> \n> In simulation: after head moves to (4,6), the segment that was there (seg1) moves to (5,6), and seg2 moves to where seg1 was, (4,6), so seg2 moves to (4,6) which is now head, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, so cannot move to a body cell except the tail cell.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (4,5), so moving to (4,5) might be possible.\n> \n> But currently, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) is to a body cell, not tail, so invalid.\n> \n> Moving down to (5,5) is empty, safe.\n> \n> Moving right to (6,6) is empty, safe.\n> \n> Moving up to (5,7) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: D (down to (5,5)) or R (right to (6,6)).\n> \n> L and U are not possible.\n> \n> U is wall, L is body collision.\n> \n> So only D or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score.\n> \n> But all food has life span 1, so if I don't eat them now, they disappear, and I get no points.\n> \n> But I need to survive long-term.\n> \n> First, can I eat any food this turn?\n> \n> Food positions: (1,1), (3,4), (5,1), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake at (5,6), so none adjacent, so I cannot eat any food this turn no matter where I move, because moving to (5,5) or (6,6), no food there.\n> \n> (5,5) has no food, (6,6) no food.\n> \n> So I cannot eat any food on turn 9; they will all disappear after this turn.\n> \n> So for turn 9, no food can be eaten, so I should just move safely to survive.\n> \n> Then after turn 9, no food? But probably new food spawns, but the problem doesn't specify how food spawns. I think we assume that after existing food is eaten or expires, new food appears, but it's not stated.\n> \n> The state only gives current food; it doesn't say anything about future food. So for planning, I need to assume that food will appear, but since it's not specified, I should focus on the current state and possible paths.\n> \n> The rule doesn't say how new food is generated, so for long-term survival, I need to avoid dead ends and keep space to move.\n> \n> Currently, with no food to eat now, I should move to a position where I can access areas for future food.\n> \n> But since future food is unknown, I need to maximize mobility.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except (5,2) is obstacle.\n> \n> So cells: (1,1) to (6,6) minus (5,2).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n> \n> After move, if I go D to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), tail (4,6)?

Wait, no: the format is (x, y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the input: \" (1, 1, 1, 1) \" – it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" but lists tuples like (1,1,1,1). I think it's (x,y, value, life_span). In the description, it says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the state, it's given as (1,1,1,1) which might be a tuple of four numbers. Probably it's (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> Similarly: (3,4,2,1) – so (3,4) value 2, life span 1\n> \n> (5,1,5,1) – (5,1) value 5, life span 1\n> \n> (6,3,8,1) – (6,3) value 8, life span 1\n> \n> All food has life span 1?

So for food with life span 1, it will disappear after turn 9, meaning at the end of turn 9, it's gone? Or during turn 9?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone by turn t+N? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is N at the start of turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before or after the turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the beginning of turn t, if a food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including the current turn. So after L turns, at the start of turn t+L, it is removed.\n> \n> For example, life span 1 at turn t=9: it will disappear after turn 9, so it can be eaten on turn 9, but not on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 5 at (5,1): value 5, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 13? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Current turn t=9.\n> \n> Food at (1,1): value 1, life span 1 – so after turn 9, it disappears. Can be eaten on turn 9.\n> \n> (3,4): value 2?

That seems odd, but let's accept it.\n> \n> In the list: (1,1,1,1) , (3,4,2,1), (5,1,5,1), (6,3,8,1) – all life span 1, so all will disappear after this turn, turn 9.\n> \n> So if not eaten on turn 9, they are gone forever.\n> \n> But the snake can only eat on turn 9 if it moves to the food cell.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,6), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R (continue right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because that's opposite, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L (left) next turn.\n> \n> So possible actions: R, U, D.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5).\n> \n> So the cells: (5,6) head, (4,6) body, (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Food at: (1,1), (3,4), (5,1), (6,3)\n> \n> All with life span 1, so must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> But (5,1) is at (5,1), which is below, but there's an obstacle at (5,2), so (5,1) might be accessible? (5,1) is at y=1, x=5, and obstacle at (5,2), so to reach (5,1), I need to go down from above, but (5,2) is blocked, so I cannot go directly to (5,1) from north; I need to come from south or sides, but y=1 is the bottom wall, so only from north or east/west, but north is (5,2) which is obstacle, so (5,1) is inaccessible? Let's see.\n> \n> Grid rows and columns: y from 1 to 6, I think, with walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is the bottom row.\n> \n> Cell (5,1): x=5, y=1.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: north (5,2), south: but y=1, south would be y=0 which is wall, so no cell.

(6,6) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=6<7. Now, is there body? Snake body is (4,6) and (4,5), so (6,6) is empty. Also, no food there? Food is at (1,1),(3,4),(5,1),(6,3), not (6,6). So moving to (6,6) is safe, no collision.\n> \n> - U: up to (5,7)? But y=7 is wall, so (5,7) is invalid, cannot move there. Walls are at y=7, so y=7 is wall, so moving up from (5,6) to (5,7) is impossible, collision with wall. So U is not possible.\n> \n> - D: down to (5,5). Is (5,5) occupied? Snake body: positions are (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). So (5,5) is not occupied, and no wall, so it should be safe. Food? (5,5) not listed, so no food, just move.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,6), but (4,6) is the body segment, the first body part. Now, if I move to (4,6), head collides with body? But according to rules, when moving, the tail will move, so let's see.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, if I move left to (4,6), which is currently occupied by the body.

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,6), which was previously occupied by the first body segment, then that segment must move to the next position.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,6)\n> \n> - Then the body segment that was at (4,6) must move to where? It was following head, but head is now at (4,6), so it should move to the next in line, but since head took its place, it needs to move to the position of the tail or something.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions.\n> \n> Current: segment 0: head at (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 1: body at (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 2: tail at (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head left to (4,6):\n> \n> New head position: (4,6)\n> \n> Now, segment 1 (which was at (4,6)) must move to where segment 0 was, but segment 0 is now at (4,6), so segment 1 should move to (5,6)?

It's turn 11, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body at (5,5), and tail at (5,6). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (4,5) from (5,5)? Let's see the positions: head is (4,5), previous was (5,5), so from (5,5) to (4,5) is moving left, so current direction is L, which matches.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 1 – so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 11, life span is 1, meaning after turn 11, it will be gone? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,4), life span 1 on turn 11. That means it will disappear after turn 11, so it can only be eaten on turn 11 if the snake moves to it now. Similarly, other foods have longer life spans.\n> \n> - (5,1) value 1, life span 3 – so it will disappear after turn 13 (since countdown starts from turn 11: turn 11: life=3, turn 12: life=2, turn 13: life=1, after turn 13 it disappears? Countdown decreases every turn, so on turn 11, life=3, after turn 11 it becomes 2, after turn 12 it becomes 1, after turn 13 it becomes 0 and disappears. But since it can be eaten as long as life span >0, I think. The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns, so on the turn when life span is 1, it can still be eaten that turn, and after that it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (6,3) value 1, life span 6 – disappears after turn 16\n> \n> - (6,1) value 1, life span 9 – disappears after turn 19\n> \n> All foods have value 1, so all are positive food? The value is given as 1, and it says \"value1\" etc., but in the description, positive food has value +1, negative has -1. Here all are 1, so all positive? But let's confirm: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and for (3,4) it's (3,4,1,1), so value=1, which is positive.\n> \n> Similarly all others have value=1. So no negative food in this state. Good.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,5), direction L (left).

I can only move to adjacent cells: same x or y, differ by 1.\n> \n> So adjacent cells to head (4,5) are:\n> \n> - West: (3,5)\n> \n> - North: (4,6)\n> \n> - South: (4,4)\n> \n> - East: (5,5) but (5,5) is the body segment, so moving east to (5,5) would be collision, since it's the second segment.\n> \n> Body positions: index 0: head (4,5), index 1: (5,5), index 2: (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So (5,5) is occupied by body, so moving to (5,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is head, but we're moving away.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4).\n> \n> Cannot move R to (5,5) because it's body.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,4) is one step away, but not directly adjacent to head; it's at (3,4), which is adjacent to (3,5) or (4,4), but not to (4,5).\n> \n> To eat (3,4), I need to be at (3,4) with head.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,5) this turn, then from there, (3,4) is south, so I could move down to (3,4) next turn, but food has life span 1, so after this turn (turn 11), it disappears. So on turn 11, if I don't move to (3,4), it will be gone.\n> \n> Life span: on turn 11, life span is 1, and it decreases every turn including current, so after turn 11, it becomes 0 and disappears.

I can only move to adjacent cells: same x or y, differ by 1.\n> \n> So adjacent cells to head (4,5) are:\n> \n> - West: (3,5)\n> \n> - North: (4,6)\n> \n> - South: (4,4)\n> \n> - East: (5,5) but (5,5) is the body segment, so moving east to (5,5) would be collision, since it's the second segment.\n> \n> Body positions: index 0: head (4,5), index 1: (5,5), index 2: (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So (5,5) is occupied by body, so moving to (5,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is head, but we're moving away.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4).\n> \n> Cannot move R to (5,5) because it's body.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,4) is one step away, but not directly adjacent to head; it's at (3,4), which is adjacent to (3,5) or (4,4), but not to (4,5).\n> \n> To eat (3,4), I need to be at (3,4) with head.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,5) this turn, then from there, (3,4) is south, so I could move down to (3,4) next turn, but food has life span 1, so after this turn (turn 11), it disappears. So on turn 11, if I don't move to (3,4), it will be gone.\n> \n> Life span: on turn 11, life span is 1, and it decreases every turn including current, so after turn 11, it becomes 0 and disappears. So to eat it, I must be on (3,4) during turn 11, meaning I move to it on turn 11.\n> \n> But from current position (4,5), I cannot move directly to (3,4) because it's not adjacent vertically or horizontally; it's diagonal. So I cannot reach it this turn. Therefore, (3,4) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Is that correct? Let me confirm the adjacency.\n> \n> Grid: cells are discrete. From (4,5), adjacent cells are (4,6) north, (4,4) south, (3,5) west, (5,5) east.\n> \n> (3,4) is west and south, so not adjacent; it's a knight move or something, but no, in grid, only orthogonal moves.\n> \n> So yes, (3,4) is not reachable from (4,5) in one move. Therefore, since life span is 1 on turn 11, it cannot be eaten and will be gone.\n> \n> So I should forget about that food.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (5,1), (6,3), (6,1)\n> \n> All with positive value.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (4,5), (5,5), (5,6).

When head moves to (3,5), the body segments follow: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.

The tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (5,4), index 1: body (4,4), index 2: tail (4,5).\n> \n> So (4,4) is the first body segment after head. If I move left to (4,4), I'm moving onto a body segment that is not the tail. Since the tail is at (4,5), and after moving, the snake will update: new head at (4,4), then the body segments follow.

After head moves to (4,4), the first body segment (which was at (4,4)) will move to where? The body segments shift: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where the head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - New head position based on direction.\n> \n> - Then, each segment from 1 to n-1 moves to the position of segment i-1?

S1 is body, not tail. So moving there would cause collision because head and S1 occupy the same cell briefly before S1 moves? But in terms of rules, it's considered collision if head touches any body segment except the tail.\n> \n> Rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by tail is ok, but moving to a cell occupied by non-tail body segment is collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,4), possible moves without collision:\n> \n> - Up to (5,5): is this free?

Is it occupied?\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5). So (5,5) is not in the list, so should be free, unless wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3), (6,4) should be free.\n> \n> Also, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (5,5) is within bounds, x=5,y=5 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,5) is not that.\n> \n> So (5,5) should be free.\n> \n> (5,3): y=3, x=5, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacle is (5,2), which is different, so (5,3) free.\n> \n> (6,4): x=6,y=4, within bounds, not obstacle, free.\n> \n> Now, head direction is R (right). Movement constraint: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is R, opposite is L. So I cannot move left immediately after a right move?

No.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> \"on next turn\" – so when I choose the action for turn t, I cannot choose the opposite of the direction I was moving in turn t-1?

The list is head first, so S0=(5,4), S1=(4,4), S2=(4,5).\n> \n> So the snake was at turn 12: head at (4,4), then it moved right to (5,4) on turn 13? No, current turn is 13, positions are for turn 13.\n> \n> \"Snake Positions\" for current turn t1=13.\n> \n> So at turn 13, snake is at (5,4), (4,4), (4,5).\n> \n> So before, at turn 12, head was at (4,4), and it moved right to (5,4), so the body was at (4,5) at turn 12? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> At turn 12, positions: head at (4,4), then the body segments. Since at turn 13, positions (5,4) head, (4,4) body, (4,5) tail, so at turn 12, head was at (4,4), and tail was at some position, but we don't have history.\n> \n> The tail at turn 13 is (4,5), so at turn 12, it was part of the body or head, but we can infer that the snake moved from a position that had (4,5) as not tail or something.\n> \n> For planning, I don't need past, only current.\n> \n> But for y-direction: from (4,5) to (4,4), y decreased, so if y decreases down, then (4,4) is below (4,5), or if y increases down, it's above. But for adjacency, it doesn't matter.\n> \n> I'll assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so y increases upwards.

No, when you move to a food cell, you eat it, and the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So for movement:\n> \n> - If no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail cell is free.\n> \n> - If eat, head moves to new cell (with food), eats it, then the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the old tail position, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,4) on turn 13, (6,4) is not food, so no eat, so new positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), and tail (4,4) — since S1 moves to (5,4), S2 moves to (4,4), and old tail (4,5) is free.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] — tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Old tail (4,5) is now empty.\n> \n> Then, at turn 14, if I move D to (6,3), which is food, so I eat it.\n> \n> New head at (6,3), and since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (6,3), then body (6,4), (5,4), and tail (4,4) — no, when eating, the new segment is added at the tail, so the tail stays, and segments shift.\n> \n> After eating at (6,3):\n> \n> - Head to (6,3)\n> \n> - Body segments: the first body segment is the old head (6,4), then old body (5,4), and since eaten, tail does not move, so the old tail (4,4) remains, and a new segment is added, but the tail position is extended, so the snake has segments: head (6,3), body1 (6,4), body2 (5,4), tail (4,4).

No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it lasts for N turns, so if spawned at turn T, it's available from turn T to turn T + N - 1, inclusive. But the countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span is L, so after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after N more turns, meaning it can be eaten for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the turn it's given, the life span is N, and after that turn, it becomes N-1 for the next turn, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So it can be eaten until the turn when life span is 1, and after that, it's gone.\n> \n> For (6,1), life span 6 at turn 15. So:\n> \n> - Turn 15: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 16: life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 20: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 21: gone\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,2), life span 8 at turn 15:\n> \n> - Turn 15: 8\n> \n> - Turn 16: 7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: 1\n> \n> - Turn 23: gone\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3), direction down. Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is down, so opposite is up, so I cannot move up next.\n> \n> So from (6,3), moving down would go to (6,2), moving left to (5,3), moving right to (7,3). But x=7 is a wall, so (7,3) is invalid. Also, (6,2): is that a wall? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,2) is within bounds, y=2 >0, x=6 between 0 and 7. But there's an internal obstacle at (5,2), but (6,2) is different.\n> \n> (5,2) is an obstacle, but (6,2) is not mentioned, so it should be free, unless it's a wall or something, but walls are only borders and that obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) to (7,7), I assume.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,3), body (6,4), (5,4), (4,4). So the snake is going down from (6,4) to (6,3), but positions are given head first: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)], so head at (6,3), next segment at (6,4), which is above it, so the snake is moving downward, since from (6,4) to (6,3) is down.\n> \n> Direction given as D, down.\n> \n> Food: (6,1) and (2,2), both +1.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (6,1) has life 6, so must be eaten by turn 20. (2,2) has life 8, by turn 22.\n> \n> But I need to eat them before they disappear.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the tail grows and collides.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,4). Is there food there? Food is at (6,1) and (2,2), not at (4,4), so no issue now.\n> \n> But after eating, the tail might not move, etc.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position (6,3):\n> \n> - Down to (6,2): is this safe? (6,2) is not a wall, not occupied by body? Body positions: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4). (6,2) is empty, I think. Also not food, food is at (6,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> - Left to (5,3): (5,3) not wall, not body (body at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), all y=4 except head y=3), so (5,3) empty.\n> \n> - Right to (7,3): but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Up: but instant reverse, not allowed since current direction down.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Down or Left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,2), then head at (6,2). But (6,2) is above (6,1), which has food. But I'm not eating it yet.\n> \n> From (6,2), I can then move down to (6,1) to eat the food, but need to check if safe.\n> \n> (6,1) is not wall, y=1>0.\n> \n> But after eating, length increases, so the tail stays, but since I eat at (6,1), head moves to (6,1), and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Let's recall how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, body follows, tail cell is free.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the new head is at the food cell, and the previous tail remains, with a new segment added.\n> \n> But for collision, when moving to a cell, if it's occupied by body except the tail, it's collision. But tail is safe to move into because tail will move away.\n> \n> But in the case of eating food under tail, there's a special rule.\n> \n> Now, back to (6,2). If I go to (6,2) now, turn 15.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), I can move to (6,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> But (6,1) is food, so if I move to (6,1), I eat it, score +1, length +1.\n> \n> Is it safe? When I move to (6,1), the head is at (6,1), and the body was at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)? Let's list positions after moving to (6,2) on turn 15.\n> \n> Current positions turn 15: head (6,3), body (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> After move down to (6,2): head moves to (6,2), then body segments move: the segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the next segment moves to the previous head position, and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> So from positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> After moving down to (6,2):\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment was at (6,4), but it should move to the previous head position (6,3)\n> \n> The segments: index 0: head, 1: next, 2: next, 3: tail.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, segment 1 moves to old position of segment 0, segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, segment 3 moves to old position of segment 2.\n> \n> So old positions: seg0: (6,3), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (5,4), seg3: (4,4)\n> \n> After head moves to (6,2):\n> \n> - New seg0: (6,2)  // head\n> \n> - New seg1: old seg0 position (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 position (6,4)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 position (5,4)  // tail now at (5,4)\n> \n> Old seg3 was (4,4), but since no food eaten, tail moves, so seg3 is removed? No, the tail moves to the previous position of the last body segment.\n> \n> In this case, since no growth, the snake moves, so tail is at old seg2 position? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So positions after move: new head at (6,2), then seg1 at (6,3) (previous head), seg2 at (6,4) (previous seg1), and seg3 at (5,4) (previous seg2). But previous seg2 was (5,4), and previous seg3 was (4,4), but since seg3 moves to where seg2 was, which is (5,4), so tail is now at (5,4), and (4,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved left to (5,3), new head (5,3), seg1 at (6,3), seg2 at (6,4), seg3 at (5,4).\n> \n> But back to moving down.\n> \n> On turn 15, if I move down to (6,2), positions become: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]  // tail at (5,4)\n> \n> Now, from here, on turn 16, I can move down to (6,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> (6,1) is food, so moving to (6,1) eats it.\n> \n> After moving to (6,1), since food eaten, the head moves to (6,1), and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So positions before move: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> Head at (6,2), move down to (6,1), eat food.\n> \n> New head: (6,1)\n> \n> Then, since food eaten, the body: seg1 moves to old head (6,2)? No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments move as usual, but instead of the tail moving away, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So before move: positions: seg0: (6,2), seg1: (6,3), seg2: (6,4), seg3: (5,4)\n> \n> After move to (6,1) with food eaten:\n> \n> - New seg0: (6,1)  // head\n> \n> - New seg1: old seg0 (6,2)  // moved to previous head\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 (6,4)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 (5,4)  // added because of growth\n> \n> So now snake is longer: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> Tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Now, is this safe? The head is at (6,1), and body segments are (6,2), (6,3), etc., so no collision with body since (6,1) is not occupied by body except tail, but tail is at (5,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> (6,1) is free, so no problem.\n> \n> But after this, the snake is longer, and I need to avoid walls and body.\n> \n> Now, the other food is at (2,2), which is far away.\n> \n> But I also need to think about the life span. (6,1) has life span 6 at turn 15, so if I eat it on turn 16, that's fine, since life span decreases to 5 on turn 16, but as long as I move to it before it disappears, it's ok. On turn 16, life span is 5, I eat it, so it's consumed.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) has longer life.\n> \n> But if I go for (6,1) now, I can eat it quickly, but then I might be in a position where it's hard to reach (2,2) or other areas.\n> \n> I should consider going for (2,2) directly, but it's at (2,2), I'm at (6,3), so I need to move left and down.\n> \n> But there's an obstacle at (5,2), which might block the path.\n> \n> Let me map the grid.\n> \n> Draw a grid:\n> \n> y=7 top? Usually in coordinates, y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume, since moving up increases y.\n> \n> In the state, snake positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), so (6,4) to (6,3) is down, so y=4 to y=3, so y decreases as we go down, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, x from left to right, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Food at (6,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> (6,1) is near the bottom wall, y=1.\n> \n> (2,2) is left side.\n> \n> Snake at (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) — so the body is at y=4, x from 4 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (6,3).\n> \n> Now, from (6,3), moves: down to (6,2) or left to (5,3).\n> \n> If I go down to (6,2), then to (6,1) to eat, as above.\n> \n> But after eating at (6,1), the snake is at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) — all in a column except the tail.\n> \n> Then from (6,1), I can move left to (5,1), or right to (7,1) but x=7 wall, invalid, or down to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.

So it can be eaten until the turn when life span is 1, and after that, it's gone.\n> \n> For (6,1), life span 6 at turn 15. So:\n> \n> - Turn 15: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 16: life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 20: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 21: gone\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,2), life span 8 at turn 15:\n> \n> - Turn 15: 8\n> \n> - Turn 16: 7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: 1\n> \n> - Turn 23: gone\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3), direction down. Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is down, so opposite is up, so I cannot move up next.\n> \n> So from (6,3), moving down would go to (6,2), moving left to (5,3), moving right to (7,3). But x=7 is a wall, so (7,3) is invalid. Also, (6,2): is that a wall? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,2) is within bounds, y=2 >0, x=6 between 0 and 7. But there's an internal obstacle at (5,2), but (6,2) is different.\n> \n> (5,2) is an obstacle, but (6,2) is not mentioned, so it should be free, unless it's a wall or something, but walls are only borders and that obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) to (7,7), I assume.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,3), body (6,4), (5,4), (4,4). So the snake is going down from (6,4) to (6,3), but positions are given head first: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)], so head at (6,3), next segment at (6,4), which is above it, so the snake is moving downward, since from (6,4) to (6,3) is down.\n> \n> Direction given as D, down.\n> \n> Food: (6,1) and (2,2), both +1.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (6,1) has life 6, so must be eaten by turn 20. (2,2) has life 8, by turn 22.\n> \n> But I need to eat them before they disappear.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the tail grows and collides.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,4). Is there food there? Food is at (6,1) and (2,2), not at (4,4), so no issue now.\n> \n> But after eating, the tail might not move, etc.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position (6,3):\n> \n> - Down to (6,2): is this safe? (6,2) is not a wall, not occupied by body? Body positions: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4). (6,2) is empty, I think. Also not food, food is at (6,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> - Left to (5,3): (5,3) not wall, not body (body at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), all y=4 except head y=3), so (5,3) empty.\n> \n> - Right to (7,3): but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Up: but instant reverse, not allowed since current direction down.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Down or Left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,2), then head at (6,2). But (6,2) is above (6,1), which has food. But I'm not eating it yet.\n> \n> From (6,2), I can then move down to (6,1) to eat the food, but need to check if safe.\n> \n> (6,1) is not wall, y=1>0.\n> \n> But after eating, length increases, so the tail stays, but since I eat at (6,1), head moves to (6,1), and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Let's recall how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, body follows, tail cell is free.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the new head is at the food cell, and the previous tail remains, with a new segment added.\n> \n> But for collision, when moving to a cell, if it's occupied by body except the tail, it's collision. But tail is safe to move into because tail will move away.\n> \n> But in the case of eating food under tail, there's a special rule.\n> \n> Now, back to (6,2). If I go to (6,2) now, turn 15.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), I can move to (6,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> But (6,1) is food, so if I move to (6,1), I eat it, score +1, length +1.\n> \n> Is it safe? When I move to (6,1), the head is at (6,1), and the body was at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)? Let's list positions after moving to (6,2) on turn 15.\n> \n> Current positions turn 15: head (6,3), body (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> After move down to (6,2): head moves to (6,2), then body segments move: the segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the next segment moves to the previous head position, and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> So from positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> After moving down to (6,2):\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment was at (6,4), but it should move to the previous head position (6,3)\n> \n> The segments: index 0: head, 1: next, 2: next, 3: tail.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, segment 1 moves to old position of segment 0, segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, segment 3 moves to old position of segment 2.\n> \n> So old positions: seg0: (6,3), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (5,4), seg3: (4,4)\n> \n> After head moves to (6,2):\n> \n> - New seg0: (6,2)  // head\n> \n> - New seg1: old seg0 position (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 position (6,4)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 position (5,4)  // tail now at (5,4)\n> \n> Old seg3 was (4,4), but since no food eaten, tail moves, so seg3 is removed? No, the tail moves to the previous position of the last body segment.\n> \n> In this case, since no growth, the snake moves, so tail is at old seg2 position? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So positions after move: new head at (6,2), then seg1 at (6,3) (previous head), seg2 at (6,4) (previous seg1), and seg3 at (5,4) (previous seg2). But previous seg2 was (5,4), and previous seg3 was (4,4), but since seg3 moves to where seg2 was, which is (5,4), so tail is now at (5,4), and (4,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved left to (5,3), new head (5,3), seg1 at (6,3), seg2 at (6,4), seg3 at (5,4).\n> \n> But back to moving down.\n> \n> On turn 15, if I move down to (6,2), positions become: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]  // tail at (5,4)\n> \n> Now, from here, on turn 16, I can move down to (6,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> (6,1) is food, so moving to (6,1) eats it.\n> \n> After moving to (6,1), since food eaten, the head moves to (6,1), and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So positions before move: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> Head at (6,2), move down to (6,1), eat food.\n> \n> New head: (6,1)\n> \n> Then, since food eaten, the body: seg1 moves to old head (6,2)? No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments move as usual, but instead of the tail moving away, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So before move: positions: seg0: (6,2), seg1: (6,3), seg2: (6,4), seg3: (5,4)\n> \n> After move to (6,1) with food eaten:\n> \n> - New seg0: (6,1)  // head\n> \n> - New seg1: old seg0 (6,2)  // moved to previous head\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 (6,4)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 (5,4)  // added because of growth\n> \n> So now snake is longer: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> Tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Now, is this safe? The head is at (6,1), and body segments are (6,2), (6,3), etc., so no collision with body since (6,1) is not occupied by body except tail, but tail is at (5,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> (6,1) is free, so no problem.\n> \n> But after this, the snake is longer, and I need to avoid walls and body.\n> \n> Now, the other food is at (2,2), which is far away.\n> \n> But I also need to think about the life span. (6,1) has life span 6 at turn 15, so if I eat it on turn 16, that's fine, since life span decreases to 5 on turn 16, but as long as I move to it before it disappears, it's ok. On turn 16, life span is 5, I eat it, so it's consumed.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) has longer life.\n> \n> But if I go for (6,1) now, I can eat it quickly, but then I might be in a position where it's hard to reach (2,2) or other areas.\n> \n> I should consider going for (2,2) directly, but it's at (2,2), I'm at (6,3), so I need to move left and down.\n> \n> But there's an obstacle at (5,2), which might block the path.\n> \n> Let me map the grid.\n> \n> Draw a grid:\n> \n> y=7 top?
