        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 1 \\):\n\n- **Snake Positions**: The snake is a single segment at `(3, 2)`, meaning it's just the head.\n- **Snake Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving **Down (D)**.\n- **Walls**: \n  - Border walls at `x=0`, `x=7`, `y=0`, `y=7`.\n  - Internal obstacle at `(5, 2)`.\n- **Food**:\n  - `(1, 1)`: Value `+1`, Life span `9`.\n  - `(5, 3)`: Value `+1`, Life span `9`.\n  - `(5, 6)`: Value `+1`, Life span `9`.\n  - `(3, 4)`: Value `+1`, Life span `10`.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nFrom `(3, 2)` with direction **D**, the snake can move:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: `(3, 1)`.\n   - Check: `y=1` is within bounds (not `y=0`), and `(3, 1)` is not an obstacle.\n   - Valid move.\n2. **Left (L)**: `(2, 2)`.\n   - Check: `x=2` is within bounds (not `x=0`), and `(2, 2)` is not an obstacle.\n   - Valid move.\n3. **Right (R)**: `(4, 2)`.\n   - Check: `x=4` is within bounds (not `x=7`), and `(4, 2)` is not an obstacle.\n   - Valid move.\n4. **Up (U)**: `(3, 3)`.\n   - This is the opposite of the current direction **D**, so it's **not allowed** (instant reverse).\n\nThus, valid immediate moves are **D**, **L**, or **R**.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nLet's look at the food positions relative to the snake's current position `(3, 2)`:\n\n1. `(1, 1)`:\n   - Distance: `|1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n2. `(5, 3)`:\n   - Distance: `|5-3| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n3. `(5, 6)`:\n   - Distance: `|5-3| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6`.\n4. `(3, 4)`:\n   - Distance: `|3-3| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2`.\n\nThe closest food is `(3, 4)` at distance `2`, but moving **Up (U)** is not allowed. The next closest are `(1, 1)` and `(5, 3)` at distance `3`.\n\n### Planning the Path\n\nGiven that we cannot move **Up (U)**, let's consider paths to `(5, 3)` and `(1, 1)`:\n\n1. **Path to `(5, 3)`**:\n   - Current: `(3, 2)`.\n   - Move **Right (R)** to `(4, 2)`.\n   - Then **Right (R)** to `(5, 2)` is invalid (obstacle at `(5, 2)`).\n   - Alternative: From `(4, 2)`, move **Up (U)** to `(4, 3)`.\n   - Then **Right (R)** to `(5, 3)` to eat.\n   - Total moves: 3 (`R`, `U`, `R`).\n\n2. **Path to `(1, 1)`**:\n   - Current: `(3, 2)`.\n   - Move **Left (L)** to `(2, 2)`.\n   - Then **Left (L)** to `(1, 2)`.\n   - Then **Down (D)** to `(1, 1)` to eat.\n   - Total moves: 3 (`L`, `L`, `D`).\n\nBoth paths require 3 moves to reach the first food. However, after eating `(5, 3)`, the snake can potentially reach `(5, 6)` more easily, while after `(1, 1)`, reaching other foods is harder due to distance.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn \\( t_0 = 1 \\)\n\nGiven the above, the immediate action should start the path towards one of the closest foods. Since both `(5, 3)` and `(1, 1)` are equally distant, but `(5, 3)` allows for easier access to `(5, 6)` later, let's start moving towards `(5, 3)`.\n\nThe first move towards `(5, 3)` is **Right (R)** to `(4, 2)`.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\n- Moving **Right (R)** to `(4, 2)`:\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - No food at `(4, 2)`, so the snake remains length `1`.\n  - Next direction is **R**, allowing moves **U**, **D**, or **R** (not **L**).\n\nThis move is safe and aligns with the plan to reach `(5, 3)`.\n\n### Considering Previous Guidance\n\nThe previous thinking model at Turn \\( t_1 = 0 \\) suggested moving **Up (U)** from `(3, 3)` (initial position), but now the snake is at `(3, 2)` moving **D**. The previous plan is not directly applicable, but the strategy to prioritize reaching the closest food still holds.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the current state and the goal to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** towards `(5, 3)`.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However, the current state shows the snake is now at (4,4) with direction L, indicating the plan was adjusted (likely due to a missed turn or updated state). \n3. **Immediate Action**: Since the snake is now at (4,4) with direction L, the next step in the original plan (moving U to (5,5)) is no longer directly applicable. However, the priority remains to reach (5,6) before it disappears (by Turn 9). From (4,4), moving **U (Up)** to (4,5) is valid (not opposite to current direction L) and starts a path toward (5,6) (e.g., via (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6)).\n\nHowever, the snake's current direction is L (Left), and the head is at (4,4). Valid moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (4,5) – Valid (not opposite to L).\n- **D (Down)**: (4,3) – Invalid (opposite to current direction U, but current direction is L, so this is actually valid. Wait, no: \"No instant reverse\" means you cannot move opposite to the *last* direction. The last move was L, so opposite is R, which is forbidden. U/D are allowed.\n  \nGiven the confusion, let's clarify:\n- Current direction is L (Left), so the snake moved from (5,4) to (4,4) by going L. Thus, the next move cannot be R (Right), but U/D/L are allowed.\n- Moving **U (Up)** to (4,5) is safe and aligns with the goal of reaching (5,6) (next turn: (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6)).\n- Moving **L (Left)** to (3,4) would eat the food at (3,4) immediately, but the original plan prioritized (5,6) due to its shorter lifespan.\n\n**Final Decision**: Stick to the original plan's priority of securing (5,6) by moving toward it. From (4,4), moving **U (Up)** to (4,5) is the best step toward (5,5) and (5,6). \n\n\\boxed{U}",

Valid moves:\n  - Down (D) to (6,2).\n  - Left (L) to (5,3).\n  - Right (R) to (7,3) is invalid (wall at x=7).\n\n### Food Analysis:\n1. **(6,1)**: Life span 6 (disappears after Turn 20). Eating it requires moving down twice (to (6,2) then (6,1)).\n2. **(2,2)**: Life span 8 (disappears after Turn 22). Requires a longer path (left 4, down 1).\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move Down (D) to (6,2)**:\n   - Next turn (16), can move down to (6,1) to eat the food.\n   - Risk: After eating, the snake is long and may get trapped near the bottom-left corner due to the obstacle at (5,2).\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5,3)**:\n   - Begins path toward (2,2), which is safer long-term.\n   - (6,1) will still be available until Turn 20, but may not be reachable after committing to (2,2).\n\n### Decision:\nPrioritize the **long-term path to (2,2)** because:\n- (2,2) has a longer life span (can be eaten up to Turn 22).\n- The path to (2,2) is safer and avoids potential traps near (6,1).\n- (6,1) is riskier due to the obstacle at (5,2) limiting escape routes.\n\n### Action:\nMove **Left (L)** to (5,3) to start heading toward (2,2).\n\n\\boxed{L}",
