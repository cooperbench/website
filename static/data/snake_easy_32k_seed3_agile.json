From current position (1,3), to reach (1,6):\n  - Need to move Up, but current direction is Down, and opposite move is not allowed.\n  - Even if direction changes later, the body blocks immediate upward movement.\n  - **Conclusion**: Cannot reach (1,6) before it expires.\n\n- **(1,1)**: Expires by turn 31. Can be eaten by moving Down now or later.\n  - Immediate eating risks trapping the snake.\n  - Delayed eating might still be possible but requires careful pathing.\n\n- **(6,6)**: Expires by turn 34. Plenty of time to reach if the snake navigates wisely.\n\n### Risk of Trapping\n\nEating (1,1) immediately (Option 1) leads to:\n- After eating, the snake is at (1,1) with a long body.\n- Must move Right to (2,1), then Up to (2,2), then Right to (3,2), etc.\n- This path seems safe as it avoids immediate body collisions and heads towards open space.\n\nDelaying eating (1,1) (Option 2) risks:\n- Getting stuck after eating later, as seen in the sequence where moving Left to (1,1) after (2,1) leads to no valid moves from (1,1).\n\n### Optimal Path\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest and most rewarding immediate action is to move Down to (1,2), setting up to eat (1,1) next turn. This ensures:\n1. Immediate +1 score and growth.\n2. A clear path to escape the corner by moving Right and then Up.\n3. Future flexibility to navigate towards (6,6).\n\n### Final Decision\n\n**Immediate Action at Turn 26**: Move Down (D) to (1,2).\n\nSubsequent moves (as planned):\n- Turn 27: D to (1,1) (eat food)\n- Turn 28: R to (2,1)\n- Turn 29: U to (2,2)\n- Turn 30: R to (3,2)\n\nThis sequence maximizes the immediate reward while ensuring the snake's survival and setting up for future food collection.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

But D is already invalid due to collision, so this doesn't restrict further.\n\n**Conclusion**: Only possible move is Left (L) to (5,6).\n\n### Verifying the Move Left to (5,6)\n\nAfter moving left to (5,6):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,6).\n- **New Direction**: Left (since we moved left).\n- **Body Update**: The tail (4,6) moves away (since no food is eaten), vacating (4,6).\n- **Food at (4,6)**: Now exposed (since tail moved away), life span decreases to 1 (will disappear after turn 55).\n\n### Next Move at Turn 55\n\nFrom (5,6), direction L.\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,7) - Wall, invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,5) - Occupied by the snake's body (segment after head), invalid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (4,6) - Now vacated and has food.\n   - Can eat the food here since the body moved away and head moves onto it.\n4. **Right (R)**: (6,6) - Occupied by the snake's body, invalid.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n- Head is at (5,6), adjacent to (4,6) (left).\n- Tail is at (3,6) (after tail moves from (4,6)).\n- Food is at (4,6), not on the tail (3,6), so no danger.\n\n**Conclusion**: Move Left (L) to (4,6) to eat the food.\n\n### After Eating at (4,6)\n\n- **Score**: +1, snake length increases by 1.\n- **New Head Position**: (4,6).\n- **New Direction**: Left.\n- **Body Update**: Tail does not move (since snake grew), so tail remains at (3,6).\n- **Food at (4,6)**: Eaten, removed from the grid.\n\n### Next Move at Turn 56\n\nFrom (4,6), direction L.\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,7) - Wall, invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,5) - Check if free:\n   - Not in snake's body positions.\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Valid move.\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,6) - Occupied by the tail (3,6), but since it's the tail, it's a collision if moving onto it unless the tail moves away first. But since we're not eating, tail moves away, but head moving to tail's current position would mean tail hasn't moved yet, so collision.\n   - Actually, when moving, tail moves first if no eat, then head moves. So if head moves to (3,6), tail would have moved away, making (3,6) free. But since tail is at (3,6), moving left would mean head goes to (3,6), tail moves to where the segment before it was, which is (2,6).\n   - However, (3,6) is the tail, and moving onto it is allowed only if the tail moves away first, which it does when not growing. So moving left is valid.\n   - But let's check positions after move left:\n     - Head moves to (3,6), tail was at (3,6), moves to (2,6).\n     - But (3,6) is now head, and (2,6) is new tail.\n     - No immediate collision.\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,6) - Occupied by the snake's body, invalid.\n\n**Choosing Between D and L**:\n- Moving left to (3,6) is valid but may lead to limited space later.\n- Moving down to (4,5) is safer, opening more options.\n\n**Conclusion**: Move Down (D) to (4,5) for more space.\n\n### Next Move at Turn 57\n\nFrom (4,5), direction D.\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,6) - Occupied by the snake's body (previous head position), invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,4) - Check if free:\n   - Not in snake's body positions.\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Valid move.\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,5) - Check if free:\n   - Not in snake's body positions.\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Valid move.\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,5) - Occupied by the snake's body, invalid.\n\n**Choosing Between D and L**:\n- Moving down to (4,4) continues downward path, away from the body.\n- Moving left to (3,5) moves towards the left side where the body is more convoluted.\n\n**Conclusion**: Move Down (D) to (4,4) for safety.\n\n### Next Move at Turn 58\n\nFrom (4,4), direction D.\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,5) - Occupied by the snake's body, invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,3) - Check if free:\n   - Not in snake's body positions.\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Valid move.\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,4) - Check if free:\n   - Not in snake's body positions.\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Valid move.\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,4) - Occupied by the snake's body, invalid.\n\n**Choosing Between D and L**:\n- Moving down to (4,3) continues the safe downward path.\n- Moving left to (3,4) starts to wrap around the body.\n\n**Conclusion**: Move Down (D) to (4,3) to continue opening space.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate and subsequent safe moves are:\n\n1. **Turn 54**: Move Left (L) to (5,6).\n2. **Turn 55**: Move Left (L) to (4,6) to eat the food.\n3. **Turn 56**: Move Down (D) to (4,5).\n4. **Turn 57**: Move Down (D) to (4,4).\n5. **Turn 58**: Move Down (D) to (4,3).\n\n### Verifying the Food at (2,2)\n\nThe other food at (2,2) is under the snake's body and will not be vacated before it disappears at turn 58. Therefore, it's not reachable, and we don't need to plan for it.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: L\nTurn 55: L\nTurn 56: D\nTurn 57: D\nTurn 58: D\n}",
