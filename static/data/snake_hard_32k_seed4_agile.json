The internal obstacles are given: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]. I need to avoid these as well as the borders.\n> \n> The snake is currently at position [(3,3)] with head direction L, which means it's facing left. Since it's only one segment, it's just the head, so no body to worry about yet. When it eats food, it will grow.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive and has the same life span, so I need to eat them to grow and score points.\n> \n> Since the snake is at (3,3) and facing left, possible moves are U, D, L, R, but I have to consider the no instant reverse rule. Current direction is L, so I cannot move right (R) on the next turn because that would be opposite. But since it's turn t1=0, and I'm choosing the first move, I can choose any direction except the reverse of current, but current is L, so reverse is R. So I cannot move right immediately. Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Grid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left, but since y=0 and y=7 are borders, and movement U is (x,y+1), which might be up or down depending on convention. I need to clarify.\n> \n> The movement says U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1). If y=0 is the bottom, then U would be increasing y, moving up, and D decreasing y, moving down. But walls are y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, U to (x,y+1) would be towards higher y, which is up if bottom is low y.\n> \n> In standard grid, often (0,0) is top-left, y increasing downward, but here movement U is (x,y+1), which if y increases downward, U would be down. But the wall is y=0 and y=7, and it says \"border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so probably y=0 is one edge, y=7 opposite.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume the grid has (0,0) at bottom-left, so y increases upwards. That way U (up) is (x,y+1), D (down) is (x,y-1), which makes sense. Similarly, L left is (x-1,y), R right is (x+1,y). I think that's standard for such descriptions.\n> \n> In the food positions, (6,4), (4,5), etc., and snake at (3,3). If y=0 is bottom, then (3,3) is near the bottom, and (4,5) is up and right, etc.\n> \n> But let's confirm with obstacles: for example, (3,6) is high y, so if y=0 bottom, (3,6) is near top.\n> \n> Similarly, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Ok, so coordinates: x from left to right, y from bottom to top.\n> \n> Snake at (3,3), head direction L, so facing left.\n> \n> Current possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: (3,4)\n> \n> - D: (3,2)\n> \n> - L: (2,3)\n> \n> - R: (4,3)\n> \n> But cannot move R because it's opposite to current direction L. So only U, D, L are possible? No, the no instant reverse means on the very next turn, I cannot go opposite. Since current direction is L, I cannot choose R for turn t1=0.\n> \n> After that, for future turns, it depends on the head direction at that time.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid with obstacles and food.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

No, the border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so corners are included.\n> \n> But for movement, we cannot move to these cells.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Now, food: (6,4), (4,5), (6,6)\n> \n> All with value +1 and life span 10, starting from turn 0.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, meaning it will disappear after 10 turns, so available until turn 10 inclusive? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span L, it can be eaten on turns where t <= t_eat < t + L, I think.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for a food spawned at some turn, with life span N, at the turn it appears, countdown is N, then next turn N-1, down to 0, and it disappears after turn when countdown reaches 0? The phrasing: \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it exists for N turns.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"including current\" means that on the turn it appears, countdown starts at N, and decreases each turn.\n> \n> So after N turns, countdown reaches 0, and it disappears at that point, I assume before the next turn or something. But for eating, as long as countdown >0, it can be eaten.\n> \n> The rule says: \"can be eaten if head moves onto the food cell\" when it exists.\n> \n> So for food at (6,4) with life span 10 at turn 0, it can be eaten from turn 0 to turn 9, since at turn 10 it disappears? Countdown: turn 0: 10, turn 1:9, ..., turn 9:1, turn 10:0 and disappears. So it exists during turns 0 to 9 inclusive, 10 turns.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (3,3), alone, so no body collision risk yet.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's find a path to eat food while avoiding obstacles.\n> \n> Possible immediate moves from (3,3): U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), cannot R.\n> \n> Now, (2,3) is an obstacle!

It's turn 2, and the grid has walls and internal obstacles. The grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So I need to avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment? [(4,4)] and head direction is R (right).

Since the snake is short, eating food will make it grow, but I have to be careful about collisions, especially with the tail when it's adjacent.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But I can't move opposite to current direction instantly.

Since the tail will move after head moves, moving to (4,4) might be okay only if the tail is not staying, but let's think.\n> \n> Collision rules: Body collision is deadly if head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving into the tail cell, it's allowed because the tail moves away. But only if the tail is moving away.\n> \n> In this case, since snake has only two segments, if I move Down to (4,4), which is the current tail, after the move, the head would be at (4,4), and the tail was at (4,4) but moves to...? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - The head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - If no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so the cell it was in becomes empty.\n> \n> - If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> Now, if I move head to the current tail position, like from (4,5) to (4,4), which is occupied by tail.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head is now at (4,4)\n> \n> - Since I didn't eat food (assuming no food there), the tail should move. But where? The tail was at (4,4), but now head is there, so the tail segment needs to move to the previous position or something? This is confusing.\n> \n> I think for a snake with two segments, moving to the tail cell is tricky.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: If the snake has length 2, and head moves to tail, if no food, the tail moves away, so head and tail swap positions, no collision. But since head moves first, and tail follows, it should be safe.\n> \n> But in terms of grid: before move, positions: head (4,5), tail (4,4)\n> \n> After move Down: head moves to (4,4), which was tail.\n> \n> Then, since no food eaten, tail moves to where? The tail was at (4,4), but now head is there, so the tail should move to the previous head position? No.\n> \n> The snake positions are a list. Before: [(4,5), (4,4)] head first.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,4): new head position is (4,4), but the body segment was at (4,4), which is now occupied by head? Conflict.\n> \n> I think I need to simulate.\n> \n> When moving:\n> \n> - New head position is based on action.\n> \n> - If new head position is not food, then the last segment (tail) is removed, so snake length same.\n> \n> - If new head position is food, tail not removed, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, for move Down to (4,4):\n> \n> - New head position: (4,4)\n> \n> - Is (4,4) food? No, food is at (6,4), etc., not (4,4). So no food eaten.\n> \n> - Therefore, tail is removed. The tail was at (4,4), but since head is moving there, and tail is removed, it's like the snake moves to (4,4) with no body, but head at (4,4) and tail removed, so new positions: only head at (4,4)? But that doesn't make sense for length 2.\n> \n> Let's think of the positions list.\n> \n> Initial positions: [head: (4,5), tail: (4,4)]\n> \n> After move Down to (4,4):\n> \n> - New head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Since not food, remove tail, which was (4,4). But (4,4) is the new head, so removing it would leave no snake? Messy.\n> \n> I think there's a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Typically in snake, the body segments follow the head. When head moves to a new cell, if not food, the tail cell is freed, and all segments shift.\n> \n> For a two-segment snake:\n> \n> - Head at A, tail at B.\n> \n> - Move head to new position C.\n> \n> - If C is not food, new positions: head at C, tail at A (since tail moves to where head was).\n> \n> - If C is food, new positions: head at C, tail at B (and a new segment, so length increases).\n> \n> In this case, moving to the tail position.\n> \n> If I move head to B, which is the current tail position.\n> \n> - New head at B.\n> \n> - If not food, tail moves to A (previous head position).\n> \n> So new snake: head at B, tail at A. Positions [(4,4), (4,5)] for example.\n> \n> And since head moved to B, which was tail, but tail moved to A, so no collision, it's safe.\n> \n> If B had food, but in this case, (4,4) has no food, so it should be safe.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, during the move, when head moves to B, for a moment it might be on the same cell, but in game logic, it's handled by the position update.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So it should be allowed and safe, as long as it's only the tail and not another body part.\n> \n> Here, snake has only two segments, so moving to tail is safe if no food or if food but not causing collision.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, for move Down to (4,4), the tail is at (4,4), and if I eat food there, but there is no food at (4,4), so it's fine.\n> \n> But for now, no food there, so moving Down to (4,4) should be possible and safe.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> But for turn 3, I cannot move Down because of no instant reverse.

It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but the walls are at the borders, meaning cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6? Not necessarily, because internal obstacles are given, so the playable area includes cells not occupied by walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), body at (3,5). Head direction is D (down).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food; no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,4), life span 5, and current turn is 5, so it will disappear after turn 5? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at the state given, for food at (6,4), life span is 5. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, after this turn (turn 5), the countdown will be 4. It will disappear when countdown reaches 0, so after 5 more turns? I need to clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" means it will be gone after N turns from now. And countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> For example, if life span is N at turn t, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown becomes N-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + (N-1), countdown becomes 0, so it disappears before turn t+N or after?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so at the end of turn t + N, it should disappear.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, countdown is N. After turn t is played, countdown decreases to N-1. Similarly, after turn t+k, countdown is N-k. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (6,4) with life span 5 at turn 5:\n> \n> - After turn 5, life span becomes 4\n> \n> - After turn 6, life span becomes 3\n> \n> - After turn 7, life span becomes 2\n> \n> - After turn 8, life span becomes 1\n> \n> - After turn 9, life span becomes 0, so it disappears after turn 9, meaning it's not available on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (6,6): life span 5, same as above.\n> \n> Food at (3,1): life span 6, so disappears after turn 5+6=11? At turn 5, life span 6. After turn 5, 5; turn 6,4; ... after turn 10, 0, disappears after turn 10.\n> \n> Food at (2,5): life span 9, disappears after turn 13 or so.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (3,4), body at (3,5), so the snake has only two segments, length 2. Head direction is down, so it was moving down to (3,4) from (3,5)? Positions are [(3,4), (3,5)], so head is at (3,4), and the body segment is at (3,5). Since head direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (3,4), so previous head was at (3,5) or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake positions are given in order: head first, then body. So [(3,4), (3,5)] means head at (3,4), and one body segment at (3,5). Since head direction is D, it was moving down, so from (3,5) down to (3,4). So on the next move, if it continues down, it would go to (3,3), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4)\n> \n> Head direction: D (down)\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is down, reverse is up, so cannot move up immediately. So possible moves are D, L, R. Down, left, right.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, not accessible.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - All border cells: x=0, x=7 for any y; y=0, y=7 for any x.\n> \n> - Plus internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Now playable area: 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except the internal obstacles.\n> \n> List all obstacles:\n> \n> - (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (1,6)\n> \n> And borders.\n> \n> Now snake: head (3,4), body (3,5)\n> \n> Food: (6,4), (6,6), (3,1), (2,5)\n> \n> All value 1, positive.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see possible actions for turn 5.\n> \n> Current position: head (3,4), direction D.\n> \n> Cannot move up (reverse), so can move down, left, or right.\n> \n> If move down to (3,3): is (3,3) accessible? No obstacles at (3,3), and it's within bounds, since y=3, x=3 between 1-6, so yes.\n> \n> If move left to (2,4): x=2,y=4, should be accessible? Check obstacles: obstacles include (2,1), (2,3), but not (2,4). (2,4) is not listed, so free. Similarly, (4,4) if right, but right to (4,4), x=4,y=4.\n> \n> Move right to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food. Since length is 2, if it eats, length becomes 3, with new head at food position, and tail remains until next move? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn, I think? But in this case, since it's moving, let's clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: when you eat food, length increases by one, but the growth happens immediately, so after moving to a food cell, the new segment is added at the position where the head was? I need to see the movement.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when the head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> But in this description, it says: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> And for movement: the snake moves one cell per turn, and if it eats food, it grows, meaning the new position is added, and tail stays or something.\n> \n> Let's read the rule: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" and \"length of snake +1\".\n> \n> Also, in the tail reward danger: \"if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\"\n> \n> That implies that when you eat food, a new segment is added at the tail position or something? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps I need to model the snake movement.\n> \n> Assume standard snake mechanics: at each turn, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell has food, the snake eats it, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell. If no food, the tail moves forward, so length stays the same.\n> \n> In this case, for the tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail, meaning the tail segment is next to head, and the tail cell has food (but food on tail cell? Food can be under body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically for tail: if the tail cell has food, and the head moves directly to it when it's exposed.\n> \n> But in the danger case: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, the new segment is added, but since head was adjacent, now the head is on the food (which was tail position), and the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is where the old tail was, but since head moved to it, they occupy same cell? No.\n> \n> Let's think: suppose tail is at position T, head is at H adjacent to T. If the snake moves to T, which has food, it eats it. After eating, the head is now at T, and since it ate, the tail does not move, so the old tail is still at T? But that would mean head and tail at same cell, collision.\n> \n> But when you move to T, the head moves to T, and if T has food, it eats, so the new head position is T, and the segment that was tail remains, but since you ate, you add a new segment, so the snake grows: the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added behind? I'm messing up.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake is a list of segments. When head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, the head moves to new cell, and the tail segment is removed, so the new snake has head at new position, and all segments shift.\n> \n> - If food, the head moves to new cell, eats food, tail does not move, so the new snake has the new head position, and the old tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, snake segments: [H, B, T] for length 3. Head H, body B, tail T.\n> \n> Move to new cell N: if no food, new segments: [N, H, B], tail T is removed.\n> \n> If food at N, new segments: [N, H, B, T], so tail T remains, and new head N, so length increased, tail is still T.\n> \n> In this case, for a snake with only two segments: [H, T].\n> \n> Move to new cell N.\n> \n> If no food: new snake [N, H], tail T is gone.\n> \n> If food at N: new snake [N, H, T], so now length 3, with segments N (head), H (body), T (tail).\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail, meaning for a two-segment snake, H and T are adjacent.\n> \n> Suppose H and T are adjacent, e.g., H at (3,4), T at (3,5), so they are vertically adjacent.\n> \n> If the head moves to T's position, which has food, then after eating, new snake: head at T position, and segments: [T, H, T]? No.\n> \n> Positions: suppose T is at (3,5), H at (3,4).\n> \n> Head moves to (3,5), which is T's position. Since it moves there and eats food, new snake: head at (3,5), and the old head becomes body, and tail remains? So segments: new head at (3,5), body at (3,4), and tail at (3,5)? But (3,5) is now head, and tail was at (3,5), so conflict.\n> \n> Since head moved to (3,5), which was tail position, and ate food, so the tail does not move, meaning the segment at (3,5) stays, but head is now at (3,5), so they are at same cell, collision.\n> \n> Hence, it kills the snake.\n> \n> Therefore, for a two-segment snake, if tail has food, and head moves directly to it, it causes collision because after move, head and tail are at same position.\n> \n> Similarly, if the snake is longer, but only when head is adjacent to tail and moves to tail position with food.\n> \n> In this case, for our snake, positions: head (3,4), tail (3,5), so they are adjacent vertically. Is there food on tail? Tail is at (3,5), but food positions are (6,4), (6,6), (3,1), (2,5), none at (3,5), so no food on tail.

It's turn 6. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I should list all blocked cells to avoid.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 – so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,4), body at (3,4). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is L, meaning it's moving left, so from (3,4) to (2,4) on the previous move.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.

Since it's moving left, the head is at (2,4) and it came from (3,4).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,4):\n> \n> - Up: (2,5)\n> \n> - Down: (2,3)\n> \n> - Left: (1,4)\n> \n> - Right: (3,4) – but (3,4) is the body, and since the snake is only 2 segments, moving right would go to (3,4), which is the current tail. But according to the rules, moving into the tail is allowed only if the tail moves away, so it should be safe because the tail will advance.\n> \n> Let me confirm the collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, for food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n> \n> In this case, no food is under the body currently.

Since the tail will move, it should be okay.

R is opposite, so invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move up, direction becomes U; down, D; left, L.\n> \n> Now, check for walls or obstacles.\n> \n> (2,5): is it blocked? Walls: internal obstacles include (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), etc., but (2,5) not listed. Borders: y=0 and y=7, x=0 and x=7. (2,5) has y=5, not 0 or 7, x=2 not 0 or 7, and not in internal obstacles: internal are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So (2,5) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3): internal obstacle (2,3) is listed, so (2,3) is blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> (2,3) is in internal obstacles: (2,3) is there, so (2,3) is wall.\n> \n> Therefore, down to (2,3) is invalid.\n> \n> Left to (1,4): (1,4) – not border, not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (1,3) and (1,6), but (1,4) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Up to (2,5): free, as above.\n> \n> So valid moves from (2,4) at turn 6: U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).

Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,4), life span 4 at turn 6. After turn 6, countdown to 3, then 2, then 1, then after turn 9, it disappears? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t when it appears, life span is N, then after that turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> But the state says \"Current Turn: t1 = 6\", and food has life span given, so at turn 6, life span is the remaining turns it will exist.\n> \n> For (6,4): life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, meaning after turn 9, it's gone? Let's think.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 6, life span 4, after turn 6, it becomes 3, after turn 7, 2, after turn 8, 1, after turn 9, 0 and disappears. So it exists during turns 6,7,8,9, and gone at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) same, life span 4.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 5, so exists until turn 10 (after turn 10, gone? After turn 6, span 5 → after t6:4, t7:3, t8:2, t9:1, t10:0 gone, so exists t6 to t10.\n> \n> After turn N, it decreases, so at start of turn, life span is current value.\n> \n> At turn 6, life span is 4 for (6,4), meaning it will be there for 4 more turns: turns 6,7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears, so not there at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) life span 5: turns 6 to 10, gone at turn 11.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 8: turns 6 to 13, gone at turn 14.\n> \n> (2,5) is very close and has long life, so not urgent.\n> \n> Now, snake is short, only 2 segments, so eating food grows it to 3.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,4), head at (2,4).

        "thinking": "### Action Sequence\n\n\\boxed{R}\n\n### Explanation\n\nGiven the current state and the analysis from the Thinking Model, the immediate action at Turn 7 is to move **Right (R)** to position (3,5). This decision is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Avoid Dead Ends**: Moving Up (U) to (2,6) leads to a dead end with no valid moves in the next turn, as both (1,6) and (3,6) are obstacles, and (2,7) is a wall. Thus, U is unsafe.\n2. **Prioritize Long-Life Food**: The short-life foods at (6,4) and (6,6) expire by turn 9 and are unreachable in time. The food at (3,1) expires by turn 10 and is also unreachable. The only viable target is the long-life food at (6,3), which is available until turn 16.\n3. **Safe Path**: Moving Right (R) to (3,5) initiates a safe path towards (6,3) via (4,5), (5,5), and (6,5), then down to (6,4) and (6,3). This path avoids obstacles and ensures the snake can reach the food without collisions.\n4. **Immediate Action**: At Turn 7, the only safe and strategic move is R, as it aligns with the long-term plan to reach (6,3) while avoiding immediate dangers.\n\nThus, the immediate action for Turn 7 is \\boxed{R}.",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 7 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 6), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (6, 4, 3, 1)\n\t- (6, 6, 3, 1)\n\t- (3, 1, 4, 1)\n\t- (6, 3, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 7 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state:\n> \n> - **Current Turn**: 7\n> - **Walls**:\n> - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and these borders are deadly.\n> - Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). These are also deadly to touch.\n> - **Snake Positions**: Head at (2,5), then (2,4), then (3,4). So the snake has three segments: head at (2,5), body at (2,4), tail at (3,4).\n> - **Snake Head Direction**: Currently facing Up, which is U. So last move was up to (2,5).\n> - **Food**:\n> - (6,4) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> - (6,6) with life span 3, value +1\n> - (3,1) with life span 4, value +1\n> - (6,3) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here. That's good; I don't have to worry about penalties.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including the current one. So for (6,4), life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 7 + 3 - 1? Let's clarify: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's there for turns t to t+N-1? The problem says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, life span N, it will be gone by turn t + N. For example, at turn 7, life span 3: it will disappear after turn 10? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So if countdown starts at N on turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn. So on turn t, countdown = N; turn t+1, countdown = N-1; ... turn t + (N-1), countdown = 1; then on turn t + N, it disappears, so not available.\n> \n> Therefore, for food at (6,4) with life span 3 at turn 7:\n> - Available on turn 7, 8, 9 (countdown 3,2,1)\n> - Disappears after turn 9, so not on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> - (6,6): life span 3, available turns 7,8,9\n> - (3,1): life span 4, available turns 7,8,9,10\n> - (6,3): life span 10, available for many turns.\n> \n> Now, snake is at positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4). Direction U, so it came from below, meaning it moved up to (2,5) from (2,4) previously? Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so (2,5) is head, then (2,4) is the segment behind, which was head before, and (3,4) is tail.\n> \n> Since direction is U, and head is at (2,5), it must have moved up from (2,4) to (2,5) on the previous move.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot instantly reverse. Since it's facing U, reverse would be D, so I cannot move Down on this turn. Allowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, inclusive. So positions from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning I cannot move to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7; those are out of bounds or walls.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,5)\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): but cannot, because reverse of current direction U.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,5)\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe:\n> \n> First, (2,6): is it a wall or obstacle?\n> \n> - Walls: border y=7 is wall, but (2,6) is y=6, not 7, so not border wall. x=2 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (5,6), etc. (2,6) not in obstacle list: obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (2,6) not there, so should be ok, but let's confirm if it's occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4). So (2,6) is empty now. But after move, if I go to (2,6), the snake will move: head to (2,6), body to (2,5), tail to (2,4)? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to new cell, the body segment that was behind moves to where head was, and so on, tail moves to where the second last segment was.\n> \n> Specifically: current positions: index 0: head (2,5), index 1: (2,4), index 2: tail (3,4)\n> \n> If head moves to (2,6), then new positions: head (2,6), then segment 1 moves to (2,5), segment 2 moves to (2,4). But segment 2 was at (3,4), now moves to (2,4), which is where segment 1 was. The tail moves to the position that the body segment was at.\n> \n> In terms of collision, I need to check if the new head position collides with any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail leaves its position, so only if head moves to a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail segment. Specifically, if it moves to the tail's current position, it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (2,6):\n> \n> - Is (2,6) occupied?

So I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (3,5), then body at (2,5), and tail at (2,4). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (3,5) from previous position.

But since it decreases including current turn, let's think.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn t, if life_span is L, then during turn t, it is present. After turn t is executed, life_span decreases by 1, so at start of turn t+1, life_span is L-1.

So the snake is horizontal, facing right, since head direction is R.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life_span 2\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life_span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, meaning positive food, since value is +1. The value is given as the third number? Let's see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\": it says (x,y, life_span, value). For example, (6,4,1,1) so that's (x,y, life_span, value). Value is 1 for all, so all positive food.\n> \n> Life_span: for (6,4) it's 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So at turn 9, life_span=1, it will disappear at the end of turn 9? Or after turn 9?\n> \n> Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at the turn when food is present, countdown starts. For food with life_span S at turn T, it will disappear after S turns, meaning it is present for turns T to T+S-1? Or after T+S?\n> \n> I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, that means:\n> \n> - At turn T, food has life_span N. After turn T, life_span becomes N-1.\n> \n> - After N turns, at turn T+N, it has life_span 0 and disappears.\n> \n> But when we say \"disappears after N turns\", it might mean after N turns from now.\n> \n> For example, food at turn 9 with life_span 1: after 1 turn, it disappears. So it is present at turn 9, and disappears before turn 10. So it can be eaten only on turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 2 at turn 9: present at turn 9 and 10, disappears before turn 11.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - (6,4,1,1): life_span 1 at turn 9, so it will disappear after this turn, meaning only available to eat on turn 9.\n> \n> - (6,6,1,1): same, life_span 1, only turn 9.\n> \n> - (3,1,2,1): life_span 2, so present at turn 9 and 10.\n> \n> - (6,3,8,1): life_span 8, present for many turns.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,5), facing right. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But current direction is R, so cannot instantly reverse to L. So cannot move left. Possible moves: U, D, R. But R is forward, U is up, D is down.\n> \n> Now, grid: let's sketch the playable grid.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Also, snake occupies: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> Food at: (6,4), (6,6), (3,1), (6,3)\n> \n> (6,3) is food, but (6,3) is within playable area? x=6, y=3. x=6 is not wall?

Since the snake is moving, if it moves right, the tail will move, so (3,5) might be free next turn, but for collision, head cannot move to body except the tail if it's moving away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] so head at (4,5), body at (3,5), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> If snake moves right to (5,5), then new positions: head to (5,5), body from (3,5) to (4,5), tail from (2,5) to (3,5), so tail leaves (2,5).\n> \n> If it moves up to (4,6), head to (4,6), body to (4,5) and (3,5), tail leaves (2,5).\n> \n> Similarly for down.\n> \n> Now, for the current turn, t=9, head at (4,5), what cells are occupied?\n> \n> Body: (3,5) and (2,5) are occupied, so head cannot move to them unless it's the tail and moving away.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Move left to (3,5): (3,5) is the body segment, which is not the tail; tail is at (2,5). So moving to (3,5) would cause collision because it's a body segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"head touches any body segment\" except if it's the tail and the tail is moving.\n> \n> But (3,5) is not the tail; tail is (2,5).

(5,5) not in obstacles? Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (5,5) not in list, and not wall, so should be free. Snake not there yet.\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) – (4,6) not in obstacles? Obstacles include (3,6), (5,6), (1,6), but not (4,6). (4,6) is y=6, which is not wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable. So (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Down: (4,4) – not in obstacles, not wall, not snake, so free.\n> \n> - Left: (3,5) – occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left because it's reverse direction? Current direction R, so reverse is L, cannot move opposite on next turn.

Food at (4,6) is not under snake; snake is at y=5, (4,6) is y=6. Similarly, others are not on snake cells.\n> \n> (4,6) is at (4,6), snake is at (3,5),(4,5),(5,5), all y=5 except (4,6) is y=6, so not under.\n> \n> But (4,6) might be accessible.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (6,6) and (3,1) have life span 1, meaning they disappear after this turn, so if not eaten on turn 10, they're gone.\n> \n> (6,3) has life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 10+7=17? Life span decreases every turn including current, so for food at turn t with life span N, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> So for (6,6): at turn 10, life span 1, so after turn 10, it disappears. Meaning if not eaten on turn 10, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1): life span 1, must be eaten on turn 10 or it's gone.\n> \n> (6,3): life span 7, so it will be there for turns 10 to 16, disappearing after turn 16.\n> \n> (4,6): life span 10, there for turns 10 to 19.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 15 or so.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot reverse instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite) on next turn. So possible moves: U, D, R. Not L.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or dangers.\n> \n> First, immediate actions: should I try to eat the food that will disappear soon?\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which is adjacent to head? Head at (5,5), (6,6) is (5+1,5+1), so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, one cell away.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: for (5,5), neighbors are:\n> \n> - Up: (5,6)\n> \n> - Down: (5,4)\n> \n> - Left: (4,5) but that's the body, occupied\n> \n> - Right: (6,5)\n> \n> (6,6) is not adjacent; it's diagonal. To reach (6,6), I need to move right to (6,5) then up to (6,6), or up to (5,6) then right to (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) must be eaten this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is far away; head at (5,5), (3,1) is left and down, many cells away.\n> \n> (3,1) is at (3,1), which is not reachable in one turn.\n> \n> So for turn 10, I cannot eat (6,6) or (3,1) directly because they're not adjacent to head.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (5,5):\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - is this free? Let's see walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so (5,6) is within bounds, x=5 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not 7, so ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: list is (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,6) is an obstacle! (5,6) is in the internal obstacles list. So (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles.\n> \n> So for (5,5):\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - obstacle, cannot move there\n> \n> - D: (5,4) - obstacle? (5,4) is in internal obstacles, yes, so cannot move down\n> \n> - L: (4,5) - this is the body segment, occupied by snake\n> \n> - R: (6,5) - let's check: x=6, y=5. Borders: x=6 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: is (6,5) listed? No, obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), etc., no (6,5), so (6,5) should be free.\n> \n> But is it accessible? We need to see if it's empty.\n> \n> Snake is at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), so (6,5) is not occupied.\n> \n> Walls not there, obstacle not there, so (6,5) is free.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5) with direction R: U, D, R are possible, but U is blocked, D is blocked, so only R is possible? But I thought U and D are directions, but they are blocked.\n> \n> Current possible actions: U, D, R (since L is reverse, not allowed).\n> \n> But U: (5,6) is obstacle, so invalid move.\n> \n> D: (5,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> R: (6,5) is free, valid.\n> \n> L: not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me double-check.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so from (5,5), moving right to (6,5) is allowed.\n> \n> Moving up would be U to (5,6), but it's an obstacle, so not possible.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (5,4) obstacle.\n> \n> Left to (4,5) is body, and also reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is R to (6,5).\n> \n> But if I move to (6,5), what happens? Snake moves: head to (6,5), body follows: (5,5) becomes body, (4,5) becomes body, (3,5) becomes tail, but since no food eaten, tail doesn't grow, so tail at (3,5) moves away? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves to the next position.\n> \n> After move to (6,5), snake positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5). Tail (3,5) is left, so it disappears.\n> \n> Now, on this turn, turn 10, I move to (6,5). But I didn't eat any food, so (6,6) is still there, but since life span 1, after turn 10, it disappears. Similarly (3,1) disappears.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (6,5), head at (6,5), direction now R.\n> \n> Food: (6,6) is above (6,5), so adjacent up. But (6,6) has life span 1, and after this turn it disappears, but turn 10 is ending.\n> \n> I moved on turn 10 to (6,5), so at the end of turn 10, food life spans decrease.\n> \n> Let's clarify the sequence.\n> \n> At turn t:\n> \n> - I choose action\n> \n> - Move to new cell\n> \n> - If that cell has food, eat it: increase score and length\n> \n> - Then, food life spans decrease by 1, and if 0, disappear.\n> \n> - Snake grows only if food eaten; otherwise, tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 10, I moved to (6,5), which has no food, so no eat, snake length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Then after move, food life spans decrease: (6,6) was life span 1, decrease to 0, so it disappears. Similarly (3,1) disappears.\n> \n> (6,3) life span decreases to 6, (4,6) to 9.\n> \n> Now turn 11: head at (6,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. Cannot reverse, last direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - but was food, but now disappeared? On turn 10 after move, (6,6) life span decreased to 0 and disappeared. So (6,6) is empty now? But it was never eaten, just disappeared.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is not there anymore.\n> \n> So (6,6) is gone.\n> \n> Now head at (6,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - now empty? But is it accessible? Let's check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> (6,6): x=6, y=6. Borders: x=6 not 0 or 7 (7 is wall, so x=6 is ok, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is within 0 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free? No, the border cells are walls, meaning that positions with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 cannot be moved to.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacles.\n> \n> (6,6): x=6, y=6. x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=6 is not 0 or 7, so not border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: list has (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) not listed, so (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> But after turn 10, (6,6) food disappeared, so cell is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is current head.\n> \n> So from (6,5):\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - free, I think.\n> \n> - D: (6,4) - check: x=6,y=4, not border, not in obstacles? Obstacles: no (6,4), so free.\n> \n> - L: (5,5) - this is the body segment now. Snake positions after turn 10: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5). So (5,5) occupied.\n> \n> - R: (7,5) - x=7, which is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L, R but R is wall, L is body and also reverse? Last direction was R to (6,5), so current direction is R.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite, which is L.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> But R to (7,5) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> L is invalid because reverse.\n> \n> So only U and D possible? U to (6,6), D to (6,4).\n> \n> Both seem free.\n> \n> Now, food available: (6,3) at (6,3), value 1, life span now 6 (after turn 10).\n> \n> (4,6) at (4,6), life span 9.\n> \n> (6,3) is at (6,3), which is directly below (6,4)? From (6,5), down to (6,4), then down to (6,3).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is at (4,6), which is left and up from (6,5)? Not directly adjacent.\n> \n> I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the snake has only 3 segments, so it's short, can maneuver.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> List all free cells or something.\n> \n> Since I need to output an action sequence for several turns, and a conclusion.\n> \n> But for turn 10, I only have one choice: move R to (6,5), as I thought earlier.\n> \n> Is that correct? On turn 10, from (5,5), only R is possible, so I must move R.\n> \n> Then turn 11, head at (6,5), and I can move U or D.\n> \n> Now, let's plan ahead.\n> \n> First, turn 10: only possible action is R, so I move to (6,5).\n> \n> Turn 11: head at (6,5), direction R. Possible moves: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4). Cannot go R or L.\n> \n> Now, (6,6) is above, free. (6,4) is below, free.\n> \n> Food: (6,3) is below at (6,3), which I can reach by going down twice: to (6,4) then (6,3).\n> \n> (4,6) is at (4,6), which I can reach by going up to (6,6) then left, but (6,6) to (5,6) or something.\n> \n> (5,6) is an obstacle, as per internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6) is blocked, so from (6,6), I cannot go left to (5,6) because obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, other obstacles.\n> \n> Also, (4,6) is food, but it might be under something? No, snake is at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), all at y=5. (4,6) is at y=6, so not under.\n> \n> Now, life span: (6,3) has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after turn 16? After turn 10, life span 6, so it decreases each turn, after turn 11:5, turn12:4, etc., until after turn 15:1, after turn 16:0, disappear? Let's define.\n> \n> At start of turn t, food has life span L.\n> \n> After action and move, if eaten, removed; else, life span decreases by 1, and if 0, removed.\n> \n> So for (6,3) at turn 10: life span 7.\n> \n> After turn 10: decreased to 6.\n> \n> Turn 11: if not eaten, decrease to 5 after turn.\n> \n> Similarly.\n> \n> It has several turns left.\n> \n> Similarly (4,6) life span 10 at turn 10, after turn 10:9, etc.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 11 choices.\n> \n> From (6,5), I can go U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n> \n> If I go U to (6,6), then head at (6,6), direction U.\n> \n> Then possible moves from there: U, D, L, R but last direction U, so cannot D (reverse).\n> \n> Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) - but y=7 is border wall, cannot.\n> \n> - D: (6,5) - but that's the body, since snake: after move to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5). So (6,5) occupied.\n> \n> - L: (5,6) - but (5,6) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - R: (7,6) - x=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U, L, R, but U wall, L obstacle, R wall, D invalid because reverse. All invalid? That would be death.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,6) on turn 11, from (6,5), then at (6,6), no possible moves except D, but D is reverse, not allowed, and other directions blocked, so I would die.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot go U to (6,6) on turn 11.\n> \n> So only choice is to go D to (6,4).\n> \n> Turn 11: move D to (6,4).\n> \n> Then head at (6,4), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5). Tail (4,5) moved away, so snake is (6,4), (6,5), (5,5).\n> \n> Now, food: (6,3) is at (6,3), directly below, adjacent down.\n> \n> Life span of (6,3) is now 5? After turn 11 decrease.\n> \n> Let's track turns.\n> \n> Turn 10: move to (6,5), no eat. Food: (6,6) and (3,1) disappear after turn 10. (6,3) life span from 7 to 6, (4,6) from 10 to 9.\n> \n> Turn 11: I move to (6,4). Cell (6,4) has no food? Food is at (6,3), not (6,4). So no eat. Snake positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5).

(6,3) with value 1, life span now 5.\n> \n> - L: (5,4) - check: x=5,y=4. Not border. Internal obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are obstacles. (5,4) is in list, so blocked.\n> \n> - R: (7,4) - x=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L, R but U is body and reverse? U is up, last direction down, so U is opposite, not allowed. D is down, allowed. L is left, not opposite to down? Directions: U and D are vertical, L and R horizontal. Reverse means opposite direction: if last was U, cannot D; last D, cannot U; last L, cannot R; last R, cannot L.\n> \n> Here last direction is D (down), so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> L and R are perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> But L to (5,4) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> R to (7,4) wall, blocked.\n> \n> D to (6,3) is possible, and has food.\n> \n> U not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,3).\n> \n> Then I eat the food at (6,3).\n> \n> So on turn 11, I move to (6,3) and eat it.\n> \n> Then snake grows: head to (6,3), new tail not grown immediately? When eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes longer.\n> \n> After eating: head at (6,3), then previous head was (6,4), which becomes body, then (6,5), (5,5).

The body: when no eat, tail moves off.\n> \n> Positions: new head (6,2), then previous head (6,3) becomes body, (6,4) body, (6,5) body, and (5,5) was tail, so it is removed. So snake: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)? (6,5) was the last body, but after growth, when we ate, the tail didn't move, so segments are fixed until next move without eating.\n> \n> After eating on turn 11, snake is 4 segments: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5).\n> \n> Now on turn 12, move to (6,2), no eat, so head moves to (6,2), then the body follows: (6,3) to where head was?

It's turn 11, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since borders are walls, I can only move within (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacles are given: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5). So the snake is horizontal, facing right, since head direction is R. So moving right from (6,5) would go to (7,5), but x=7 is a wall, so I can't go right. Head is at (6,5), and moving right would be (7,5), which is out of bounds since x=7 is wall. Similarly, up would be (6,6), down (6,4), left (5,5). But (5,5) is the body, but since it's the tail, I might be able to move there if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 1. Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 11, life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 11, so I need to eat it this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (3,1) with life span 1 at turn 11, if not eaten on turn 11, it disappears after turn 11, so I must eat it on turn 11 to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) with value 1, life span 6. So it will disappear after turn 11 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Example: at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N more turns? The description says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, L decreases by 1 to L-1. If L-1 >0, it stays for next turn. It disappears when L reaches 0 after a turn.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think N is the number of turns it remains, including the current one.\n> \n> For example, if life span is 1 at turn t, it is available only on turn t; after turn t, it disappears.\n> \n> If life span is 2 at turn t, it is available on turn t and t+1; disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Generally, food with life span L at turn t will disappear after turn t + L - 1. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For (3,1): life span 1 at turn 11, so only available on turn 11. Must eat now or lose it.\n> \n> (6,3): life span 6, available from turn 11 to 11+6-1=16.\n> \n> (4,6): life span 9, available from turn 11 to 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,5), direction R. Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But R to (7,5) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> U to (6,6): is that a wall? y=6 is not border yet; border is y=7 and y=0. Grid is x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (6,6) is within bounds? x=6, y=6, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are safe? No.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 free? Let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) to (6,6) should be free, but we have internal obstacles.\n> \n> (6,6): x=6, y=6. x=6 is not x=0 or x=7, y=6 is not y=0 or y=7, so it should be free unless it's an obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (6,6) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,4): should be free?

Since it's the second segment, and tail is (4,5), I need to see if moving to (5,5) is safe.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a body segment that is not the tail, it's collision. If I move to the tail segment, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, snake positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5).\n> \n> If I move left to (5,5), that's the second segment, not the tail. Tail is (4,5). So moving to (5,5) would be head touching body segment, which is collision. So I cannot move left to (5,5) because it's not the tail; it's the body.\n> \n> The tail is the last segment, which is (4,5). So (5,5) is the segment before tail, so it's part of the body, not tail.

But (3,1) is at x=3,y=1. Head at (6,5), which is far away. From (6,5) to (3,1) is not adjacent, so I can't eat it this turn anyway. Since I can only move one step, and (3,1) is not adjacent to head, I cannot eat it on turn 11. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn; I miss it.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) life span 1 at turn 11, so only available turn 11. But head not adjacent, so cannot eat.

When I move, the head moves to new position, and each segment follows, tail is removed unless I eat food.\n> \n> Standard snake: when I move, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed. If I eat food, tail doesn't remove, so length increases.\n> \n> Here, if I move to (6,4), no food there, so snake becomes: head (6,4), then body (6,5), then (5,5), tail (4,5) is removed?

Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (6,3) — is (6,3) valid? (6,3): x=6,y=3. Borders: x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,3) not listed, so should be free? Food is at (6,3), but food can be eaten, so moving there is possible, but we eat it.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) with life span 6, value 1.\n> \n> - L: to (5,4) — (5,4) is internal obstacle? Yes, (5,4) is in the list: (5,4) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) — x=7 is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - U: but U is opposite direction, cannot move instantly reverse, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,3)? But let's confirm.\n> \n> Allowed moves: from (6,4), with direction D.\n> \n> Possible: D, L, R, but R to (7,4) wall, L to (5,4) obstacle, so only D to (6,3) is possible? But (6,3) has food, and it's not blocked.\n> \n> But is there any issue? Tail reward danger? No, tail is at (5,5), not adjacent to head.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), tail at (5,5), which is diagonally? Adjacent means sharing side, I think. So (6,4) adjacent cells: (6,5) north? Let's define directions.\n> \n> Assume y increases north, so U north, D south.\n> \n> So (6,4): north (6,5), south (6,3), west (5,4), east (7,4)\n> \n> But (7,4) wall, (5,4) obstacle, (6,5) is body, which is occupied by snake body, but since it's moving, we can move to tail cell if tail moves away, but here (6,5) is not tail, it's the body segment before tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,4) head, (6,5) body, (5,5) tail]\n> \n> So (6,5) is occupied, so moving to (6,5) would be collision, unless it's the tail and we eat food, but here not tail.\n> \n> From (6,4), moving U to (6,5) is invalid because it's occupied by body and not tail, and we're not eating food there. Food is at (6,3), not at (6,5).\n> \n> Also, U is opposite direction, so already invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,3).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> (6,3): is it wall? No, borders: x=6 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: list has (5,3), (5,4), etc, but not (6,3), so (6,3) is free, with food.\n> \n> So moving D to (6,3) is possible, and we eat the food there.\n> \n> Then snake grows: since positive food, length increases by one, so new positions: head to (6,3), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (6,5) body, (5,5) tail, so snake becomes [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Now, after eating, life span of that food decreases, but since eaten, it's gone.\n> \n> Other food at (4,6).\n> \n> But the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (6,3), I eat food, score +1, snake longer.\n> \n> But what about future moves?

When moving to (6,2), the tail moves to where? Snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So from [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], move head to (6,2), so new head (6,2), then body: (6,3) from previous head, (6,4), (6,5), and tail was (5,5), but since we didn't eat, length same, so tail moves off, new positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (5,5) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> After eating on turn 12, snake grew, so 4 segments: positions [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Then turn 13, move to (6,2), no eat, so snake: head (6,2), then body: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). The tail (5,5) is gone, since no growth, so segments: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]? (6,5) was body, now it becomes the last body, but (5,5) was tail, and we didn't eat, so when head moves to (6,2), the body segments move: the first body segment goes to previous head position (6,3), second body to (6,4), third body to (6,5), and tail (5,5) is left, so it disappears. So new snake: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]? Positions: head (6,2), then the body that was at (6,3) moves to (6,3)?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game:\n\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 grid with coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and at specific internal obstacles.\n  \n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: Head at (6,3), followed by (6,4), (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n  - Current direction: Down (D), meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n\n- **Food**:\n  - Positive food at (4,6) with a value of +1 and life span of 7 turns (disappears at turn 20).\n  - Positive food at (1,5) with a value of +1 and life span of 10 turns (disappears at turn 23).\n\n- **Walls**:\n  - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n\n### Determining Possible Moves for Turn 13\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,3), moving downward (D). The possible moves from here are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: Move to (6,2).\n   - Check if (6,2) is valid:\n     - Not a border wall (x=6, y=2 are within bounds).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (not listed in internal walls).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (only the tail is at (5,5), which will move away unless we eat food).\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (5,3).\n   - (5,3) is an internal obstacle (listed in walls). Invalid.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (7,3).\n   - x=7 is a border wall. Invalid.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: Move to (6,4).\n   - (6,4) is the second segment of the snake's body (not the tail), so it's a collision. Also, moving up is the reverse of the current direction (D), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 13**: The only valid move is **Down (D)** to (6,2).\n\n### Verifying the Move to (6,2)\n\nAfter moving to (6,2):\n\n- New head position: (6,2).\n- Body segments shift:\n  - Body at (6,3) (previous head).\n  - Body at (6,4) (previous first body segment).\n  - Tail at (6,5) (previous second body segment).\n- (5,5) is now empty (tail moves away).\n\nNo food is at (6,2), so the snake does not grow, and the tail moves away from (5,5).\n\n### Planning Subsequent Moves\n\nGiven that the only immediate move is D to (6,2), let's plan the next moves to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\n**Food Considerations**:\n\n1. **(4,6)**:\n   - Life span: 7 turns from turn 13, so disappears after turn 20.\n   - To reach (4,6) from (6,2), the Manhattan distance is |6-4| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n   - Possible path: Left to (5,2), then (4,2), then up to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and finally (4,6) on turn 19.\n   - However, after eating at (4,6), the snake would be trapped:\n     - Head at (4,6), body at (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n     - Possible moves from (4,6):\n       - Up to (4,7): wall.\n       - Left to (3,6): wall.\n       - Right to (5,6): wall.\n       - Down to (4,5): body segment. Collision.\n     - Thus, eating (4,6) leads to immediate death on the next turn. Avoid this food.\n\n2. **(1,5)**:\n   - Life span: 10 turns from turn 13, so disappears after turn 23.\n   - To reach (1,5) from (6,2), a possible path is:\n     - Left to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then up to (3,3), (3,4), left to (2,4), (1,4), then up to (1,5) by turn 21.\n   - This path avoids obstacles and allows eating (1,5) safely:\n     - After eating at (1,5), possible moves:\n       - Right to (2,5): not a wall or body (assuming body is not there yet).\n       - Other directions may be blocked, but right is safe.\n\n**Optimal Path**:\n\nGiven that (4,6) is a death trap, focus on reaching (1,5):\n\n1. **Turn 13**: D to (6,2).\n2. **Turn 14**: L to (5,2).\n3. **Turn 15**: L to (4,2).\n4. **Turn 16**: L to (3,2).\n5. **Turn 17**: U to (3,3).\n6. **Turn 18**: U to (3,4).\n7. Continue to (2,4), (1,4), then (1,5) by turn 21.\n\nThis sequence ensures reaching (1,5) before it disappears and allows an escape after eating.\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 13\n\nBased on the above, the only valid and safe move for turn 13 is **Down (D)** to (6,2).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So for (4,6), life span 7 means it will disappear after 7 turns from now, so at turn 13 + 7 = turn 20, it's gone. Similarly, (1,5) with life span 10 will disappear at turn 13 + 10 = 23.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). (0,0) is bottom-left? Usually in coordinates, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But in snake games, it often doesn't matter as long as consistent. I'll assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up, but head direction is D, which is down, so y decreases as we go down? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Head direction is D, and snake positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). Since head is at (6,3) and previous segment is (6,4), and direction is D (down), that means moving down decreases y. So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top row? Let's see: from (6,5) to (6,4) to (6,3) with direction D, so from (6,4) to (6,3) is down, so decreasing y.

Is this safe? (6,2) is not a wall? Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (6,2): x=6 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (6,2) not in this list, so empty? But we need to check if occupied by snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). (6,2) not in this list, so empty.

So the snake is vertical, going downwards, since head direction is D (down). The head is at (6,2), and the body segments are at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Since it's moving down, the next position would be south, so y decreasing? No, let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The walls are given with y=0 and y=7, and since head direction is down, I think y=0 is the bottom and y=7 is top, or vice versa? Head direction D means moving down, so from (6,2) to (6,3)? That doesn't make sense because if y increases upwards, moving down would decrease y. I need to define the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the movement constraints: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. That means y=0 is the bottom row, and y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Head at (6,2), which is y=2, and body at (6,3) y=3, which is above since y=3 > y=2? y=3 is higher y, so if y increases upwards, (6,3) is north of (6,2). But head direction is D, down, meaning it was moving to lower y. From where did it come?\n> \n> Current head is at (6,2), and it's moving down. Last turn, head must have been at (6,3) or something. Snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]. This is listed as head first, so head is (6,2), then next segment is (6,3), then (6,4), then tail at (6,5).\n> \n> Since head direction is D (down), that means it was moving down to (6,2). Before that, head was at (6,3), moved down to (6,2). So the body segments: after head moves to (6,2), the segment that was at (6,3) is now the first body segment, but in the list, (6,3) is the second position, meaning it's the neck or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: positions list has head at index 0, then the adjacent body segment, and so on to the tail.\n> \n> So here: index 0: (6,2) head\n> \n> index 1: (6,3)  // this is the segment that was head before moving\n> \n> index 2: (6,4)\n> \n> index 3: (6,5) tail\n> \n> Since head moved down from (6,3) to (6,2), and direction is down, so current direction is down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

Life_span decreases every turn, so if not eaten, it will be gone when life_span reaches 0.\n> \n> Since it decreases including current turn, at turn 14, it has life_span 6, meaning it will disappear after turn 14 + 6 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if food has life_span L, it means:\n> \n> - After turn t, L decreases to L-1\n> \n> - It exists as long as L > 0\n> \n> - Disappears when L becomes 0, which happens after the turn where it was decreased to 0.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L: after turn t, L = L-1; if L-1 == 0, it disappears before turn t+1.\n> \n> Standard: at the start of turn, food with life_span L is present; after the turn, L decreases; if L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> But the problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think for this, since it decreases including current turn, at turn t, with life_span L, after this turn, L becomes L-1.

It's turn 15, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I have to account for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So these are cells the snake can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Since head direction is D (down), that means the snake is moving downwards. But (6,1) is the head, and it's at y=1, moving down to lower y? No, typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U is y+1, that means y increases as we go up. But in the snake positions, head is at (6,1), and moving D (down) to (x,y-1), so from (6,1) down would be to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. But the head is at (6,1) with direction D, so it must have come from above, meaning from (6,2) or something. Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]. Head is first, so (6,1) is head, then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) is the tail. Direction is D, which is down, meaning towards decreasing y. But (6,1) to (6,2) would be increasing y if y+1 is up? I'm confused.\n> \n> Movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — so if y increases, it's up.\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) — y decreases, so down.\n> \n> In positions, (6,1) is head, and it's at y=1. Moving D to (x,y-1) would go to y=0, which is a wall. But since the snake is at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), with head at (6,1) and direction D, that means it was moving down to (6,1) from (6,2)? That doesn't make sense because positions are listed head first, so from head to tail.\n> \n> Typically, the head is the first element, and the tail is the last. So positions: index 0: head (6,1), index 1: (6,2), index 2: (6,3), index 3: tail (6,4).\n> \n> Direction is D, meaning it was moving down. But if it was moving down to (6,1), that would mean it came from a higher y, like (6,2) to (6,1), which is decreasing y, so down. Yes, that makes sense. So from (6,2) to (6,1) is moving down to (6,1).\n> \n> Now, at turn 15, head is at (6,1), and it just moved there, I assume. The direction is the current heading.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6), it disappears after 5 turns, meaning turn 15 + 5 = turn 20, but since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn 15, life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns, so on turn 20 it's gone. Similarly, (1,5) life span 8, disappears on turn 15 + 8 = turn 23.\n> \n> Now, the snake is at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So it's vertical, from y=1 to y=4, all at x=6.\n> \n> Head at (6,1), direction D (down), but it can't move down because y-1=0 is wall. So it must change direction.\n> \n> Possible moves: since current direction is D, it can move L, R, or U, but not D because instant reverse would be U, but D to U is opposite? Directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down). Cannot move opposite, which is U (up). So possible moves: L (left), R (right), or D, but D is to (6,0) which is wall, so invalid. So only L or R are possible.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) so (5,1)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) so (7,1) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is border wall, so (7,1) is out of bounds, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is L to (5,1).\n> \n> But is (5,1) free? Snake body: positions are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So (5,1) is not occupied by body. Also, walls: internal obstacles include (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), but (5,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So (5,1) is not an obstacle, not a wall, so it should be movable.\n> \n> But let's list all wall cells for clarity.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: specific cells (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n> \n> So for (5,1): x=5, y=1. Not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is head, so moving to (5,1) should be possible, but after moving, the snake will have new positions.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the tail will also move, so positions shift.\n> \n> But for collision, when moving to (5,1), is there body there? Current body: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) and (5,1) is not among them. Head was at (6,1), moving to (5,1), which is empty.\n> \n> Also, after move, the new head is (5,1), then body: since head moves, the body follows, so the segment that was at (6,1) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves from (6,1) to (5,1), then the segment that was at (6,2) moves to (6,1), the one at (6,3) moves to (6,2), and tail at (6,4) moves to (6,3). So new positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). The tail was at (6,4), which moves to (6,3), but (6,3) was occupied, but since it moves away, it's fine, no collision.\n> \n> Collision is only if head moves into a body segment that is not the tail, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,1), no body there, so safe.\n> \n> But we have food to consider.\n> \n> Food at (4,6) and (1,5).\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, value +1, life span 5.\n> \n> (1,5) at x=1,y=5, value +1, life span 8.\n> \n> Now, from current position, head at (6,1), only possible move is L to (5,1), since D to (6,0) wall, R to (7,1) wall, U to (6,2) but U is opposite to D, and instant reverse not allowed, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Current direction is D, moving U would be opposite, so not allowed. Only L or R possible, but R to (7,1) wall, so only L to (5,1) is possible.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 15, action must be L.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (5,1), new head position (5,1), direction now L (since moved left).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Tail was at (6,4), now at (6,3) after move.\n> \n> Length is 4, same.\n> \n> No food eaten, since (5,1) has no food listed.\n> \n> Food is at (4,6) and (1,5), not (5,1).\n> \n> Now, turn 16, head at (5,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction L, cannot move R (opposite). Can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> L: to (4,1)\n> \n> U: to (5,2)\n> \n> D: to (5,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> Also, (5,0) is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible: L to (4,1) or U to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (4,6) disappears in 5 turns, so by turn 20. (1,5) disappears in 8 turns, by turn 23.\n> \n> Snake is at (5,1), with body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n> \n> The grid has obstacles, so I should sketch the grid.\n> \n> Let me make a mental grid. x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, so at x=5, y=3 and y=4 are blocked.\n> \n> Also, (5,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Now, snake at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> From (5,1), can move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is free? y=2, x=5, not listed as obstacle, so free.\n> \n> (4,1) should be free, no obstacle listed.\n> \n> But let's list all blocked cells for safety.\n> \n> Border walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\n> \n> So free cells are all except these.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,6) and (1,5).\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6.

At turn 16, after move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). Tail at (6,3) moved to (6,2)? Let's track.\n> \n> At turn 15 end: positions (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) is tail.\n> \n> Now turn 16, move from head (5,1) to new position.\n> \n> If move U to (5,2), new head (5,2), then body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). The segment that was at (6,3) is not there anymore; tail was (6,3), after move, the last segment moves to where the previous tail was, but since head moved, the body shifts: the first body segment moves to previous head position, etc.\n> \n> Standard: new positions: head at new cell, then the previous head position becomes first body, and so on, up to the previous second-to-last becomes last body, and tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> Specifically: old positions: head A, body B, C, D (tail).\n> \n> After move to new head E: new positions: head E, then A, B, C.

After move to (5,2), positions are (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), so (6,2) is tail, I think. Positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — so (6,2) is the last body segment, which is tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (6,2), it would collide because (6,2) is a body segment (tail), but when head moves to tail position, if the tail moves away, it might be ok, but in this case, when head moves to (6,2), the tail is at (6,2), but after move, the tail would move to (6,1) or something.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and the tail moves away, it doesn't collide. But here, (6,2) is tail, so if head moves to (6,2), at the same time, the tail moves to the previous position of the second-to-last segment.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (6,2), which is current tail position, but after the move, the snake will have head at (6,2), and body: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1). The cell (6,2) was tail, but now head is there, and tail is at (6,1), so no collision, because the tail moved away.\n> \n> Generally, moving into the tail cell is safe as long as it's not a body segment that stays there.\n> \n> So from (5,2), moving R to (6,2) should be safe, since (6,2) is tail and will move.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (4,2) should be safe.\n> \n> Moving U to (5,3) invalid.\n> \n> So from (5,2), can go L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n> \n> Option 2 from turn 16: from (5,1) move L to (4,1)\n> \n> Then at (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> Then possible moves: L to (3,1), R to (5,1) but R is opposite to L, so cannot (instant reverse), U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall invalid.\n> \n> So can move L to (3,1) or U to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, let's think about reaching the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,6): to reach it, we need to go up to y=6 from y=1 or 2.\n> \n> But there are obstacles on the way.\n> \n> For example, at x=5, y=3 and y=4 are blocked, so we cannot go up directly on x=5.\n> \n> Also, (5,6) blocked.\n> \n> So from (5,1), if we go up to (5,2), then we are stuck because (5,3) blocked, so we must go left or right.\n> \n> If go right to (6,2), but (6,2) is body or free? After move to (5,2), (6,2) is tail, so moving to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> But then from (6,2), we can go up to (6,3), but (6,3) is free? At that point, after moving to (6,2), new positions, but (6,3) might be free.\n> \n> Let's plan a path to (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n> \n> From current (5,1), one way is to go left to (4,1), then up to (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n> \n> But (4,3) is free?

Let me confirm the grid size.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable, but there are internal obstacles too. Internal obstacles are: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So I need to avoid those as well.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,1), then body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is 4 segments long. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it just moved left to (5,1) from, say, (6,1), but positions show head at (5,1), then (6,1), which is the neck, so it must have been at (6,1) before moving left to (5,1). So current head direction is L, so it can't move right instantly next turn because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Current turn is 16, so for food at (4,6), life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 20. Similarly, (1,5) life span 7, gone by turn 23, and (2,2) life span 10, gone by turn 26.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> List them:\n> \n> - (3,6) obstacle\n> \n> - (2,1) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,3) obstacle\n> \n> - (2,3) obstacle\n> \n> - (5,6) obstacle\n> \n> - (5,3) obstacle\n> \n> - (5,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,6) obstacle\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (5,1), body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> Head direction L, so from (6,1) to (5,1), moved left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,1): since head direction is L, I can move U (up), D (down), or L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,1)\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,2) – is this free? Let's check.\n> \n> y=2, x=5. Is there an obstacle or wall? Walls are at borders, so (5,2) is within bounds. Obstacles: (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, but (5,2) is not listed, so it should be free. Snake body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) – (6,2) is at y=2,x=6, so (5,2) is different cell. So (5,2) should be free to move to.\n> \n> - Down: (5,0) – but y=0 is wall, so cannot move down, out of bounds.\n> \n> - Left: (4,1) – x=4,y=1. Within bounds? x=4 between 1-6, y=1, but y=1 is not wall, wall is y=0. Obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) is not listed. Snake body: head is at (5,1), body at (6,1), etc., so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (6,1) – but (6,1) is the neck of the snake, occupied by body. But according to rules, moving into the tail might be possible if the tail moves away, but let's see the collision rules.\n> \n> Deadly collisions: body collision if head touches any body segment, except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward, so it's safe only if you're moving to where the tail is and the tail leaves.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,1), moving right to (6,1): (6,1) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the move, the snake moves, so head goes to (6,1), and the tail moves from (6,3) to... let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> After one move, say I move right to (6,1). Then new head is at (6,1), and the body segments follow: the segment that was at (6,1) moves to where the head was? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, if head moves to (6,1), then the segment at (6,1) moves to (5,1), but (5,1) was head, now it's occupied by the second segment? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> - Segment 0: head at (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: at (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: at (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: tail at (6,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,1):\n> \n> - New head: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (6,1)) moves to where head was, (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (6,2)) moves to where segment 1 was, (6,1)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment shifts to the position of the segment in front of it.\n> \n> So, after head moves to (6,1):\n> \n> - New head position: (6,1)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (6,1) now moves to the position of the head, which was (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment that was at (6,2) moves to where segment 1 was, which is now (6,1)? Positions:\n> \n> - Old positions: head (5,1), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3)\n> \n> - After head moves to (6,1):\n> \n> - Head now at (6,1)\n> \n> - seg1 moves to old head position: (5,1)\n> \n> - seg2 moves to old seg1 position: (6,1) — but (6,1) is now head, conflict?\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when the head moves, the tail end moves forward, so the segment that was tail might be left.\n> \n> Better to think: the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But in this case, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So for movement without eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - So from positions: index 0: head (5,1), index 1: (6,1), index 2: (6,2), index 3: tail (6,3)\n> \n> If head moves to (6,1), then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,1)\n> \n> - New segment 1: position of old head, which is (5,1)\n> \n> - New segment 2: position of old segment 1, which was (6,1), but (6,1) is now the head, so segment 2 moves to (6,1)? That would cause collision.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: after move, the body segments occupy the positions that were occupied by the previous segments, except the head is new.\n> \n> So the new positions are:\n> \n> - Head at new position: (6,1)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment at the old head position: (5,1)\n> \n> - Second body segment at the old position of first body segment: (6,1) — but (6,1) is now the head, so (6,1) is occupied by both head and second segment? That can't be.\n> \n> Ah, error. When the head moves to a cell that was occupied by the first body segment, it's a collision unless that segment is the tail and it moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell occupied by the body, it's deadly, except if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (6,1) is occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail. The tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> So moving to (6,1) would cause head to collide with segment 1, which is deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,1), I cannot move right to (6,1) because it's occupied by the body and not the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (5,0) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,1) are:\n> \n> - Up to (5,2)\n> \n> - Left to (4,1)\n> \n> - Down: not possible, wall\n> \n> - Right: not possible, body collision\n> \n> So only U or L.\n> \n> Now, (5,2): is it free? No obstacles at (5,2), and snake body is at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, (5,2) is x=5,y=2, different, so free.\n> \n> (4,1): x=4,y=1, no obstacle, not snake body, so free.\n> \n> So actions for turn 16: U or L.\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Food locations: (4,6), (1,5), (2,2)\n> \n> Life spans: (4,6) life 4, so disappears after turn 20? Current turn 16, life span 4, so it will be present on turns 16,17,18,19, gone on turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life 7, present turns 16 to 22, gone 23.\n> \n> (2,2) life 10, present 16 to 25, gone 26.\n> \n> All positive, so I want to eat them if possible.\n> \n> But I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's see where I can go.\n> \n> From (5,1), if I move U to (5,2), or L to (4,1).\n> \n> If I go U to (5,2), then head at (5,2), direction U.\n> \n> Then from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is obstacle! (5,3) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> D to (5,1), but that might be reverse or not, but (5,1) will be empty after move? After moving to (5,2), the snake body: head to (5,2), then segment 1 to (5,1), segment 2 to (6,1), segment 3 to (6,2), tail at (6,2) or (6,3)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> After move U to (5,2):\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head position (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 position (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old seg2 position (6,2)\n> \n> - Tail is now at (6,2), and (6,3) is free.\n> \n> So positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), tail (6,2)\n> \n> From (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,3): but (5,3) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> - D to (5,1): but (5,1) is now occupied by segment 1, so body collision, deadly.\n> \n> - L to (4,2)\n> \n> - R to (6,2): (6,2) is occupied by tail? Currently, after move, tail is at (6,2). If I move to (6,2), head to (6,2), but (6,2) is tail, and since tail moves away, it might be safe? But when I move to (6,2), the tail was there, but after move, tail moves to old seg2 position, which was (6,1)? Positions after move:\n> \n> If head moves to (6,2) from (5,2):\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head position (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 position (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old seg2 position (6,1)\n> \n> - So tail is now at (6,1), and (6,2) is head, so no collision because the tail moved from (6,2) to (6,1).\n> \n> But (6,2) was tail, and head moved there, but since tail moves away, it's safe, as per rules.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves.\n> \n> But here, from (5,2), moving R to (6,2) is possible and safe.\n> \n> Also, L to (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> And U and D not possible as above.\n> \n> So from (5,2), moves: L to (4,2) or R to (6,2)\n> \n> Now, back to turn 16, if I move L to (4,1) instead.\n> \n> From (5,1) move L to (4,1):\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old seg2 (6,2)\n> \n> - Tail at (6,2) or (6,3)?

Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), etc., (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - D: (4,0) - but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: (3,1) - similarly, not snake, not wall. Obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - R: (5,1) - but (5,1) is body segment. Now, can I move there? The rule says: \"Cannot move to body segment except possibly the tail if it moves away.\" But (5,1) is not the tail; tail is (6,2). So moving to (5,1) would collide with body, deadly. So R is invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because opposite direction is disallowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible actions from current position: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Food available:\n> - (4,6): life span 3, so it disappears after turn 17 + 3 = turn 20? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 17, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left, including turn 17, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (4,6) at turn 17, life span 3, so it will be present on turns 17, 18, 19, and disappear on turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 6: present turns 17 to 22 (since 17+6-1=22), disappear turn 23.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 9: present turns 17 to 25, disappear turn 26.\n> \n> All food is +1, so eating any is good, but I need to get to them safely.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (4,1), and I need to move towards food or safe areas.\n> \n> But first, let's plan a sequence starting from turn 17.\n> \n> Possible moves: U or L.\n> \n> If I go U to (4,2), or L to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, from (4,2), where can I go? Or from (3,1).\n> \n> I should consider the food positions.\n> \n> (4,6) is at y=6, x=4, which is above, but there are obstacles.\n> \n> (1,5) is left and up.\n> \n> (2,2) is left and down, but (2,2) is food, but there are obstacles near.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (6,2), which might move.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]. Head at (4,1), tail at (6,2).\n> \n> When the head moves, the tail will also move depending on the direction.\n> \n> For example, if head moves U to (4,2), then new positions: head to (4,2), then body segments follow: (4,1) becomes body, (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2) moves to where? The tail was at (6,2), and it was moving... Let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no growth, but when eating food, length increases.\n> \n> No food eaten yet in this move, so if head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So for current snake: segments: index 0: head (4,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: tail (6,2).\n> \n> If head moves to new position, say (4,2), then:\n> - New head: (4,2)\n> - Segment 1 moves to where head was: (4,1)\n> - Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was: (5,1)\n> - Segment 3 (tail) moves to where segment 2 was: (6,1)\n> \n> So new positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] and tail is now at (6,1), but (6,2) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves L to (3,1), new positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] and tail at (6,1), (6,2) vacated.\n> \n> (6,2) was tail, but after move, it moves to (6,1), so (6,2) is free.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n> \n> Let's consider going U first.\n> \n> Turn 17: move U to (4,2)\n> \n> Then new head position (4,2), head direction now U (since moved up).\n> \n> Snake: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n> \n> Tail at (6,1)\n> \n> Now, from (4,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n> \n> So can move U, L, R.\n> \n> - U to (4,3): is it free? (4,3) not snake, not wall. Obstacles: (5,3) is obstacle, (5,4), etc., but (4,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - L to (3,2): similarly, should be free.\n> \n> - R to (5,2): (5,2) - obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are obstacles, but (5,2) not listed, so should be free? (5,2) is x=5,y=2.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), so (5,2) is not occupied, so free.\n> \n> But (5,1) is body, but (5,2) is different.\n> \n> (5,2) is empty now.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (4,1) but (4,1) is body segment now, so cannot move there, and also D is opposite if direction U, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So from (4,2) with dir U, can go U to (4,3), L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,6) is above, so going U might be towards it.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L from (4,1) on turn 17.\n> \n> Turn 17: move L to (3,1)\n> \n> New head position (3,1), head direction L.\n> \n> Snake: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] tail at (6,1)\n> \n> From (3,1), possible moves: since dir L, cannot move R.\n> \n> Can move U, D, L.\n> \n> - U to (3,2): free? (3,2) not snake, not wall, obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, (1,3), etc., (3,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - D to (3,0): but y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L to (2,1): but (2,1) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,1), so cannot move there.\n> \n> - R to (4,1): but (4,1) is body segment, and not tail, so collision, invalid. Also opposite direction disallowed.\n> \n> So from (3,1), only possible move is U to (3,2), since D and L invalid, R invalid.\n> \n> So if I move L on turn 17, I must move U on turn 18, no choice.\n> \n> Whereas if I move U on turn 17, I have more options on turn 18.\n> \n> So moving U might be better for flexibility.\n> \n> But let's think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is left and down from (3,1) or something.\n> \n> Also, there is an obstacle at (2,1) and (2,3), so (2,2) might be accessible, but need to see.\n> \n> (2,2) is food, and obstacles are at (2,1) and (2,3)? Obstacles include (2,1) and (2,3), so (2,2) is free, but surrounded? (2,2) has neighbors: (2,1) obstacle, (2,3) obstacle, (1,2), (3,2), etc.\n> \n> (1,2) might be free, (3,2) free.\n> \n> But to reach (2,2), I need to come from above or below, but below y=1 has obstacle at (2,1), so only from left or right or above.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5) at (1,5), which is top-left, and (4,6) at (4,6), top.\n> \n> But (4,6) has life span 3, so only available until turn 19, meaning I need to eat it by turn 19 at latest.\n> \n> Turn 17,18,19 to eat.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 6, until turn 22.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, from current position (4,1), to reach (4,6), I need to go up, but there are obstacles in the way.\n> \n> For example, to go to (4,6), I need to go from (4,1) to (4,2), (4,3), but (4,3) is free, then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n> \n> (4,4) should be free, (4,5) free? Let's check obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), etc., but (4,4) not listed, (4,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> (4,5) is y=5,x=4, no obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is food, but there is an obstacle at (3,6) and (5,6), so (4,6) is between them, but (4,6) itself is not obstacle, it's food.\n> \n> But to reach (4,6), I need a path.\n> \n> From (4,1) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6).\n> \n> (4,3) to (4,4) etc.\n> \n> But are there any blocks? (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, but they are at x=5, so not directly blocking x=4.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) at x=3,y=6, not on x=4.\n> \n> So the column x=4 seems clear from y=1 to y=6, except for possible snake body.\n> \n> But when moving, the snake body moves, so it might be possible.\n> \n> However, when I move up, the body follows.\n> \n> For example, if I go U now to (4,2), then snake is at (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> Then from there, if I go U to (4,3), new positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n> \n> Then U to (4,4): head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n> \n> Then U to (4,5): head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n> \n> Then on turn, say, if I start from turn 17 U, turn 18 U, turn 19 U, turn 20 U, but (4,6) disappears on turn 20? Life span.\n> \n> (4,6) life span 3 at turn 17, so present turns 17,18,19, disappear turn 20.\n> \n> So to eat on turn 19, I need to be at (4,6) on turn 19.\n> \n> From (4,1) at turn 17, if I go U to (4,2) on turn 17.\n> \n> Then turn 18: U to (4,3)\n> \n> Turn 19: U to (4,4) — but (4,4) is not (4,6), I need to reach (4,6) by turn 19.\n> \n> From (4,1) to (4,6) is 5 steps up? y from 1 to 6, delta y=5, so from (4,1) to (4,6) is 5 moves: to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n> \n> So turns: turn 17 to (4,2), turn 18 to (4,3), turn 19 to (4,4), turn 20 to (4,5), turn 21 to (4,6) — but (4,6) disappears on turn 20, so on turn 20 it's gone, so I can only reach it by turn 19 at latest.\n> \n> But on turn 19, if I am at (4,4), I can move to (4,5) or something, but not to (4,6) directly.\n> \n> To be on (4,6) on turn 19, I need to start moving earlier.\n> \n> At turn 17, I am at (4,1). After move on turn 17, I am at new position at end of turn 17.\n> \n> Turn 17: after moving, head is at new cell.\n> \n> At start of turn 17, head at (4,1). After action, head moves to new cell, and that position is for turn 17.\n> \n> Then on turn 18, from that new position, etc.\n> \n> To be at (4,6) on turn t, I need to move to it on turn t.\n> \n> For (4,6), it must be eaten by turn 19, so head must be on (4,6) on turn 19.\n> \n> From (4,1) at turn 17 start, after turn 17 move, I can be at (4,2) or (3,1).\n> \n> If I go to (4,2) on turn 17, then on turn 18 I can go to (4,3), then on turn 19 to (4,4) — but (4,4) is not (4,6), I need to be at (4,6) on turn 19.\n> \n> From (4,2) on turn 17 end, to (4,6) is 4 moves: to (4,3) on turn 18, (4,4) on turn 19, (4,5) on turn 20, (4,6) on turn 21 — but (4,6) gone on turn 20, so I cannot reach it in time from here. Even if I move directly up, it takes 4 moves to go from y=2 to y=6, which is 4 steps, but from (4,2) to (4,6) is delta y=4, so 4 moves: to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So turns: turn 18 to (4,3), turn 19 to (4,4), turn 20 to (4,5), turn 21 to (4,6) — but on turn 20, food disappears, so not available on turn 20 or 21. Only on turns 17,18,19.\n> \n> So on turn 19, I need to be at (4,6). But from turn 17 end at (4,2), on turn 18 I can go to (4,3), on turn 19 to (4,4), which is not (4,6). I cannot reach (4,6) by turn 19 from (4,2).\n> \n> If on turn 17 I go to (4,2), I can only reach up to (4,4) on turn 19.\n> \n> (4,4) is not food, and (4,6) is too far.\n> \n> If on turn 17 I go L to (3,1), then on turn 17 end at (3,1), then on turn 18 I must go U to (3,2) as we saw earlier, then on turn 19 from (3,2) I can go to (3,3) or something, but (3,2) to (4,6) is even farther.\n> \n> So it seems impossible to reach (4,6) by turn 19 from current position, because it's 5 cells away in y-direction, and I have only 2 moves after turn 17 to reach it by turn 19.\n> \n> At turn 17 start, head at (4,1), I make a move to new position for turn 17.\n> \n> Then turn 18, move to new position.\n> \n> Turn 19, move to new position; that position must be (4,6) to eat on turn 19.\n> \n> From (4,1), after first move, I am at either (4,2) or (3,1) at turn 17 end.\n> \n> From (4,2) at turn 17 end, after turn 18 move, I am at some position at turn 18 end, say (4,3) if U, then at turn 19 move to (4,4) at turn 19 end.\n> \n> (4,4) is not (4,6).\n> \n> From (3,1) at turn 17 end, turn 18 to (3,2), turn 19 to say (3,3) or other, not (4,6).\n> \n> So indeed, I cannot reach (4,6) by turn 19; it's too far with only 2 moves available after the first.\n> \n> Since I start at (4,1) and need to be at (4,6) on turn 19, the Manhattan distance is |4-4| + |6-1| = 5, and in 2 moves (turn 18 and 19), I can cover at most 2 cells, so from y=1, after move turn 17 to y=2 or same, then turn 18 to y=3, turn 19 to y=4, max y=4, not 6. So impossible. Thus, (4,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> So I should ignore (4,6) and focus on other food.\n> \n> Now, other food: (1,5) and (2,2).\n> \n> (1,5) at (1,5), life span 6, so present until turn 22.\n> \n> (2,2) at (2,2), life span 9, until turn 25.\n> \n> Now, snake at (4,1), need to move towards them.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (3,1), then as before, I must go U to (3,2) on turn 18.\n> \n> Then from (3,2), I can go to (2,2) if possible.\n> \n> (2,2) is food, and from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), but (2,2) has obstacles at (2,1) and (2,3), but (2,2) itself is not obstacle, it's food.\n> \n> But to move to (2,2) from (3,2), that would be left, so direction L.\n> \n> Now, is (2,2) safe?

(3,3) not snake, not wall. Obstacles: (2,3) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - L to (2,2): (2,2) is food, and not snake, not wall, and not obstacle, so should be free to move.\n> \n> - R to (4,2): (4,2) not snake, etc., free.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,2) on turn 19, I eat the food at (2,2), since it's present.\n> \n> Life span of (2,2) is 9, turn 17 to 25, so on turn 19 it is present.\n> \n> By moving to (2,2) on turn 19, I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> But let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Turn 17: L to (3,1)\n> \n> Turn 18: U to (3,2) — must, no choice.\n> \n> Turn 19: move L to (2,2) to eat food.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows: head to (2,2), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so new tail is added.\n> \n> Standard: when eat food, head moves to food cell, body follows, but tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions: before move, snake at [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n> \n> Move head to (2,2), so new head (2,2), then body: segment1 to where head was (3,2), segment2 to (3,1), segment3 to (4,1), and since food eaten, add new segment at tail position, so tail stays at (5,1)? No.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to new cell (with food), each body segment moves to previous position, but since food eaten, the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> Before move: segments [head, seg1, seg2, tail]\n> \n> After move with food eaten: new head at new position, seg1 to old head, seg2 to old seg1, tail to old seg2, and new tail added at old tail position? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when head moves to a food cell, the head occupies the food cell, the body segments move such that each moves to the position of the previous segment, but since food is eaten, the tail does not advance, so the new position has the head at food, and the tail remains where it was, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, but the segments shift.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions: [A, B, C, D] where A head, D tail.\n> \n> If head moves to E (with food), then new positions: [E, A, B, C, D] — so E is new head, A is now segment after head, B, C, D tail. So D remains tail, but now there is an extra segment at the end, so length increased by one.\n> \n> The cell that was tail is still occupied, but now by the new segment before tail? In this case, from [A,B,C,D] to [E,A,B,C,D], so D is still there, but now it's the second last, and tail is still D? Positions: E, then A, then B, then C, then D, so tail is D.\n> \n> But the cell D was occupied, and after move, it is still occupied by D, but now it's not the tail anymore? No, in the list, positions are occupied, so from [A,B,C,D] to [E,A,B,C,D], so the cell A,B,C,D are all occupied before, after move, E is new, A,B,C,D are still occupied, but the snake is now at E,A,B,C,D, so head E, then body A,B,C, tail D.\n> \n> The tail segment is still at D, so the cell D is still occupied, and no new cell is vacated; instead, cell E is now occupied.\n> \n> In terms of grid, cell E was empty, now occupied by head; cells A,B,C,D were occupied, and after move, A,B,C,D are occupied by body segments, with D still tail.\n> \n> In this case, the tail position doesn't change when eating food? I think I have it.\n> \n> When no food: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous segment position, so tail moves to where the second last was, and the old tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> With food: head moves to new cell (food), each body segment moves to previous segment position, but the tail does not move; instead, it stays, and a new segment is added, so the tail remains at its position, and the body extends.\n> \n> From positions [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> Move to new head position N (with food).\n> \n> Then new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, T]  -- so N new head, H is now first body, B1 second body, B2 third body, T tail.\n> \n> T remains at same position, and since a new segment is added, length increases.\n> \n> In grid, the cell T was occupied, still occupied, no change; cell B2 was occupied, now by B2? In new positions, B2 is at its old position? Let's think coordinates.\n> \n> Suppose old positions: head at (4,1), body at (5,1), (6,1), tail at (6,2) for original.\n> \n> In our case after turn 17 L move.\n> \n> After turn 17 move L to (3,1): positions [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] tail at (6,1)\n> \n> At turn 18, move U to (3,2): no food, so new positions: head to (3,2), body: (3,1) to where head was? Segment1 moves to (3,1) — old head position? After move, new head at (3,2), segment1 at old head position (3,1), segment2 at old segment1 position (4,1), segment3 at old segment2 position (5,1), and tail was segment3, so it moves to (5,1), and old tail cell (6,1) vacated.\n> \n> So snake now [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] tail at (5,1)\n> \n> Then turn 19, move to (2,2), which has food.\n> \n> So head to (2,2), with food, so new positions: head at (2,2), segment1 at old head position (3,2), segment2 at old segment1 position (3,1), segment3 at old segment2 position (4,1), and since food eaten, add new segment at old tail position (5,1), so new tail at (5,1).\n> \n> So snake: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] length 5 now.\n> \n> And (2,2) food eaten.\n> \n> Now, is this safe?

Moving left immediately positions the snake closer to the left side, and subsequent upward moves along x=3 create a safe path to (1,5) by turn 22, leveraging the food's remaining life span of 6 turns. Avoiding (2,2) prevents entrapment due to surrounding obstacles.\n",

It's turn 18, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are the borders. There are also internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake is horizontal, facing left, since head direction is L. That means the head is at (3,1), and it's moving left, so from (4,1) to (3,1) on the previous move? Let's see: positions are [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)], and head direction is L, so the head is at (3,1), and it just moved left to there. The body segments are at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), so the tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Since it's moving left, and positions are listed head first, so (3,1) is head, then (4,1) is the first body segment, etc. So the snake is occupying (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). All at y=1, x from 3 to 6.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, so +1 each.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 18, life span is 2, so after turn 18, it will have 1 left, and after turn 19, it disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 18 or 19.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 5: after turn 18, 4 left; turn 19, 3; etc., up to turn 22 it disappears (since 18+5-1=22?

So (3,2) should be free, I think.\n> \n> List all occupied cells:\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, e.g., for y=0: (0,0) to (7,0) are walls; y=7: (0,7) to (7,7); x=0: (0,0) to (0,7); x=7: (7,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Snake: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> So cell (3,2): not a border wall, not in internal obstacles, not occupied by snake, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, down (D): to (3,0) — but y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> x=3,y=0: since y=0 is wall, yes.\n> \n> And right (R): but current direction is L, so moving right is instant reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (3,1) are: Up to (3,2) or Left to (2,1) but (2,1) is obstacle, blocked.

When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current positions: turn 18, snake: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n> \n> If I move up to (3,2), new head (3,2), then body segments: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1).

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 19 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 6), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 6, 1, 1)\n\t- (1, 5, 4, 1)\n\t- (2, 2, 7, 1)\n\t- (4, 3, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 19 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 19, and I have to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> The grid has walls: border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the edges. Internal obstacles are at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I should sketch this mentally to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake is 4 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it just moved up to (3,2) from (3,1), I assume. Since head direction is U, it can't instantly reverse to D on the next turn.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 1 – this will disappear after this turn if not eaten now? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 19, life span is 1, meaning after turn 19, it will be gone. So if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 4 – so it will disappear after turn 22? Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 19, life span 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including this one. After turn 19, life span becomes 3, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears. So (1,5) will be available until turn 19 + 4 - 1 = turn 22? Let's clarify: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? No.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for (4,6) at turn 19, life span 1, so after this turn (turn 19), it will have life span 0 and disappear, so it must be eaten now or not at all.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 4 at turn 19, so it will be available for turns 19,20,21,22, and disappear after turn 22 (life span 0 at turn 23? Let's see: at turn 19, life span 4; after turn 19, at turn 20, life span 3; after turn 20, turn 21, life span 2; after turn 21, turn 22, life span 1; after turn 22, turn 23, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 23. So it can be eaten from turn 19 to 22 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> \n> - (2,2) life span 7, available for many turns.\n> \n> - (4,3) life span 10, also long time.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,2), direction U. So possible moves: U, L, R. Cannot D because it would be reverse from U.\n> \n> If I move U, to (3,3). Is that safe? Let's check for collisions.\n> \n> Current positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). After move U, head to (3,3), then the body will move: the tail (5,1) will be left, and the new position depends on eating or not. If no food eaten, tail moves, so body becomes (3,3) head, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) – let's simulate.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it. If not eating, the tail segment is removed. If eating, tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> But here, no food at (3,3), I think. Food is at (4,6), (1,5), (2,2), (4,3). Not at (3,3).\n> \n> So if I move U to (3,3), head at (3,3), then body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). Tail was (5,1), which is removed since no food eaten. So positions after move: head (3,3), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). (4,1) was the second last, now it becomes third segment? Snake positions: after move U: head to (3,3), then the first body segment moves to previous head (3,2), second body to previous first body (3,1), third body to previous second body (4,1), and tail (5,1) is removed. So new positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)].\n> \n> Now, (3,3) is not a wall or obstacle? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is inside. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (3,3) not in obstacles, so safe.\n> \n> But let's check if (3,3) is occupied by body? Current body before move: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). After move, body will be (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), all different from (3,3), so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Possible actions at turn 19:\n> \n> - U: to (3,3)\n> \n> - L: to (2,2) – but (2,2) has food! Value 1, positive.\n> \n> - R: to (4,2)\n> \n> Now, (4,2) – is it safe? Current positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). After R to (4,2), head to (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). Tail (5,1) removed. So positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]. (4,2) not in obstacles, and not body, since body will be at (3,2), etc., different.\n> \n> But (4,2) might be food? Food at (4,3), (4,6), not (4,2). So no food there.\n> \n> L to (2,2): (2,2) has food with value 1, life span 7. So if I move L, I eat the food at (2,2).\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe. Moving to (2,2), which is not wall or obstacle. Obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (2,2) is not listed, so ok.\n> \n> Now, after eating, snake grows. Head to (2,2), then since eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (2,2), then body segments: previous head (3,2) becomes first body, then (3,1), then (4,1), then (5,1) remains as tail. So snake becomes [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] – length 5.\n> \n> But is there any danger? Tail at (5,1), not adjacent to head. Head at (2,2), tail at (5,1), not adjacent.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (4,6) with life span 1, which must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> Current head at (3,2), (4,6) is at (4,6), which is far away. To reach (4,6) from (3,2) in one move? Impossible, since I can only move one step. (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, head at x=3,y=2, so not adjacent. So I cannot eat (4,6) this turn; it will disappear after this turn. So I should ignore it, as it's not reachable now.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,5) at (1,5), (2,2) at (2,2), (4,3) at (4,3).\n> \n> (2,2) is adjacent to head, since (3,2) to (2,2) is left, one step.\n> \n> (4,3) is at (4,3), from (3,2), not adjacent; I need to move to (3,3) or (4,2) first.\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), far.\n> \n> So immediate options:\n> \n> - Move L to (2,2): eat positive food, grow to length 5.\n> \n> - Move U to (3,3): no food, but position.\n> \n> - Move R to (4,2): no food.\n> \n> Now, head direction after move: if I move L, new head direction L; if U, U; if R, R.\n> \n> Then next moves depend.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, avoid risks, like dead ends or collisions.\n> \n> First, let's consider the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So let's list all obstacles:\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (1,3)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (1,6)\n> \n> And borders.\n> \n> Now, snake at [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] – so the body is at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). Head at (3,2).\n> \n> Food: (4,6) life span 1, so gone after this turn.\n> \n> (1,5) life span 4, available turns 19-22\n> \n> (2,2) life span 7\n> \n> (4,3) life span 10\n> \n> (4,3) is at (4,3), which is above (4,2), but (5,3) is obstacle, so (4,3) might be accessible from left or below.\n> \n> Since (4,6) is not reachable, I should focus on other food.\n> \n> Option to eat (2,2) now by moving L.\n> \n> But let's see what happens after that.\n> \n> If I eat (2,2) at turn 19, snake grows to length 5: positions [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n> \n> Head at (2,2), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> From (2,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction L, so cannot instantly reverse to R.\n> \n> So possible: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2)\n> \n> Now, (2,1) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,1), so cannot move D to (2,1).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) is also an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,3).\n> \n> So from (2,2), if I move D to (2,1), it's obstacle, die.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,3), it's obstacle, die.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,2), that might be possible.\n> \n> (1,2) – is it wall or obstacle? Borders: x=0 is wall, y=0 wall, but (1,2) x=1,y=2, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,3) and (1,6), not (1,2), so (1,2) should be free.\n> \n> So from (2,2), only safe move is L to (1,2). Cannot go U or D because obstacles, and cannot go R because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So if I move to (2,2) at turn 19, then at turn 20, I must move L to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, at (1,2), head direction L.\n> \n> Then from (1,2), possible moves: U, D, L? Cannot R, reverse.\n> \n> U to (1,3): but (1,3) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,3), so cannot.\n> \n> D to (1,1): (1,1) – not obstacle? Internal obstacles not listed, and not border, so should be free.\n> \n> L to (0,2): but x=0 is wall, so cannot, die.\n> \n> So from (1,2), moves:\n> \n> - U: (1,3) obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - D: (1,1) possible\n> \n> - L: (0,2) wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: reverse, not allowed\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (1,1).\n> \n> Then at turn 20, move to (1,2), then turn 21, move D to (1,1).\n> \n> Now (1,1): head at (1,1), direction D.\n> \n> Then possible moves: from (1,1), U to (1,2), but that's where I came from, and body might be there, but need to see.\n> \n> Let's simulate positions.\n> \n> Start: turn 19, move L to (2,2), eat food, so snake: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]  length 5.\n> \n> Turn 20: move L to (1,2). No food at (1,2), so not eating. Move head to (1,2), body moves: (2,2) to first body, (3,2) to second, (3,1) to third, (4,1) to tail. (5,1) removed? Since no food, tail removed. Positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> After turn 19: positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] since ate food.\n> \n> Turn 20: move to (1,2), not eating, so head to (1,2), then segments: new body positions: the segment that was at (2,2) moves to where head was? Standard: when moving, head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> After turn 19: segments: index 0: head (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: tail (5,1)\n> \n> Turn 20: move head to (1,2), no eat, so new head (1,2), segment 1 moves to previous head (2,2), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (3,2), segment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (3,1), segment 4 moves to previous segment 3 position (4,1), and since no eat, tail segment 4 is removed, so positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]? No: segments: head new (1,2), body0: previous head (2,2), body1: previous body0 (3,2), body2: previous body1 (3,1), body3: previous body2 (4,1), and previous tail (5,1) is gone. But body3 is at (4,1), which was the position of body2 before move? Let's list previous positions:\n> \n> Before move turn 20: head (2,2), body0 (3,2), body1 (3,1), body2 (4,1), body3 (5,1)\n> \n> After move to (1,2), no eat: head to (1,2), body0 to previous head position (2,2), body1 to previous body0 position (3,2), body2 to previous body1 position (3,1), body3 to previous body2 position (4,1), and body3 was tail, but since no eat, it is removed, so the tail is at (4,1), but body3 is the last segment.\n> \n> New positions: head (1,2), then body segments: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ] – so length 4 again? No, after eating at turn 19, length was 5, but at turn 20 no eat, so when moving without eating, snake length decreases? No.\n> \n> Snake length increases only when eating. When not eating, length stays the same, but the tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n> \n> At turn 19 after move and eat: positions: head (2,2), body segments: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) – so 5 positions.\n> \n> At turn 20, move to (1,2), no food, so: head moves to (1,2), the first body segment moves to the previous head position (2,2), the second body segment moves to the previous first body position (3,2), the third body segment moves to the previous second body position (3,1), the fourth body segment (tail) moves to the previous third body position (4,1), and since no food, the tail position is left, but the segment that was at (5,1) is removed, so the new tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> Positions after turn 20: head (1,2), body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) – so still 5 segments? Let's count: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) – that's 5 positions. The tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> Previous tail was at (5,1), which is removed, and body segments shift, but since there was a body segment at (4,1) before, it moves to (4,1) but it's still there? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when not eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So before turn 20 move: cells occupied: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n> \n> After move to (1,2) no eat: head to (1,2), so (1,2) occupied.\n> \n> The segment that was at head (2,2) moves to where? The body segments follow: the first body segment (which was at (3,2)) moves to (2,2) - previous head position.\n> \n> The second body segment (which was at (3,1)) moves to (3,2) - previous position of first body.\n> \n> The third body segment (which was at (4,1)) moves to (3,1) - previous position of second body.\n> \n> The tail segment (which was at (5,1)) moves to (4,1) - previous position of third body.\n> \n> And since no eat, the cell (5,1) is vacated.\n> \n> So new occupied cells: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n> \n> Yes, positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> Tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Now, at turn 21, from (1,2), we move D to (1,1), as only option.\n> \n> Move D to (1,1), no food there, so head to (1,1), body: first body to previous head (1,2), second body to previous first body (2,2), third body to previous second body (3,2), tail to previous third body (3,1), and (4,1) vacated.\n> \n> Positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)]\n> \n> Now at (1,1), head direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R?

After move, body will be at (1,2), but when moving, head to (1,1), body moves, so (1,2) will be occupied by body, but U to (1,2) is the cell that will be occupied by the first body segment after move, so it's a collision.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving to (1,1), the cell (1,2) is occupied by the first body segment, so moving up to (1,2) would cause head to collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) obstacle.\n> \n> So indeed, no safe move from (1,1), so the snake dies on turn 22 if I go this path.\n> \n> Therefore, moving L to (2,2) at turn 19 leads to a dead end in a few turns.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 20, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns, so it's gone at turn 24? Let's clarify the life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it disappears after t + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If at turn t, a food has life span L, then:\n> \n> - On turn t, countdown is L\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the start of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that if life span is L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including the current turn. So it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's see an example.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span is 1. Then it decreases on this turn, so after this turn, it should be gone. So if life span is 1, it disappears after the current turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if life span is N, it decreases by 1 each turn, and after N decreases, it disappears. Since it decreases on the current turn, after N turns from now, it will have decreased N times and be gone.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span L:\n> \n> - During turn t: food is present, countdown is L\n> \n> - After turn t is processed, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When countdown is 1, after that turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for life span L at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Let's set t as current turn.\n> \n> At start of turn t, food has life span L.\n> \n> During turn t, it can be eaten. If eaten, it's consumed. If not eaten, at end of turn, life span decreases to L-1.\n> \n> Similarly for next turns.\n> \n> The food disappears when life span reaches 0, which happens after the decrease at the end of turn.\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t:\n> \n> - It can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to turn t + L - 1 (since on turn t + L - 1, life span is 1, decreases to 0 after that turn).\n> \n> - On turn t + L, it is not present.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Turn 20:\n> \n> - Food at (1,5): life span 4, so can be eaten on turns 20,21,22,23. Gone on turn 24.\n> \n> - Food at (2,2): life span 6, can be eaten on turns 20 to 25. Gone on turn 26.\n> \n> - Food at (4,3): life span 9, can be eaten on turns 20 to 28. Gone on turn 29.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,3), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down. So cannot move Down next turn. Allowed moves: Up, Left, Right. Not Down.\n> \n> Now, let's see the positions around head:\n> \n> - Up: (3,4) - is this available? Let's check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls, so (3,4) is within 1-6, so no border wall. Internal obstacles: list has (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (3,4) not in list, so free? But snake body? Snake body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). (3,3) is head, so (3,4) is empty? Body is at (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - Left: (2,3) - but (2,3) is an internal obstacle! From the list: (2,3) is an obstacle. So cannot move Left to (2,3).\n> \n> - Right: (4,3) - (4,3) has food? Food at (4,3) is present. But is it occupied? The cell (4,3) has food, but the snake can move there to eat it, unless it's blocked.\n> \n> (4,3) is not a wall, not an obstacle? Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (5,3) is obstacle, but (4,3) is not listed, so it should be free except for food.\n> \n> But food is there, so moving to (4,3) would eat the food.\n> \n> Now, also, snake body: positions are (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So (4,3) is not part of body, so it's free.\n> \n> - Down: (3,2) - but (3,2) is part of the snake body, segment 2. But can we move to body? Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Here, (3,2) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (4,1). So moving to (3,2) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Down to (3,2) is invalid.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (3,4): free, no obstacle.\n> \n> - Left to (2,3): but (2,3) is obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> - Right to (4,3): has food, but can move to eat it.\n> \n> - Down to (3,2): body segment, collision, not allowed.\n> \n> So only two possible moves: Up or Right.\n> \n> Right to (4,3) would eat the food there immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,1). Head at (3,3). Are they adjacent? (3,3) and (4,1) – not adjacent, since |dx| + |dy| = |3-4| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 >1, so not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> If I move Right to (4,3), I eat the food at (4,3), which is positive, so snake grows by one segment. After eating, the new tail will be added, so snake becomes positions: new head at (4,3), then previous head (3,3) becomes body, then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and since it ate, it grows, so tail stays or new segment? When snake eats food, it grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food, and the tail doesn't advance, so you grow.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So on turn when you eat, after moving head to food, the body moves except the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move Right to (4,3):\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,3), eats food.\n> \n> - Body: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where head was? No, in snake movement, all segments move: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So initial positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] with head (3,3).\n> \n> After moving Right to (4,3):\n> \n> - New head at (4,3)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment moves to old head position (3,3)\n> \n> - Second body segment moves to (3,2)\n> \n> - Tail moves to (3,1)? No: the segments: index 0: head new position (4,3)\n> \n> Index 1: position of old head (3,3)\n> \n> Index 2: position of old index 1 (3,2)\n> \n> Index 3: position of old index 2 (3,1)\n> \n> But old index 2 was (3,1), so tail moves to (3,1). But (4,1) was tail, now it moves? Since we ate, the tail doesn't move, and we add a new segment.\n> \n> Rule: when eating, the snake grows, so the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position? Or the tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> Typically in snake: when no eat, head moves, each segment follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, body follows, but tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food, then the previous positions except the tail is not removed, so the new body includes the old head and all except tail is shifted, but tail remains and a new segment is added? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose positions before move: S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail)\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new position, S0 becomes body at its position, S1 moves to S0 old, ..., Sk moves to Sk-1 old, and Sk old position is free.\n> \n> With eating: new head at food, S0 becomes body at its position, S1 moves to S0, ..., Sk stays? No, Sk moves to Sk-1, but since we eat, we don't remove the tail, so the tail position remains occupied, and we have a new segment at the tail position? Actually, after moving head and body, the tail doesn't advance, so the position that was tail remains, and the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> For example, snake: H at A, B at B, T at C.\n> \n> After move to D (food): new H at D, B at A, T at B. But T was at C, now at B, so C is free? But since we ate, T should not move, so we have H at D, B at A, and T still at C? But then positions are H,D; B,A; T,C. But C was T, now it's still there, and we have an extra segment? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: when snake eats, it moves to the new cell, and the tail does not shorten, so the length increases by one. So the tail position remains occupied, and the new head is added.\n> \n> In terms of positions: old positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]\n> \n> After moving to new head position P_new:\n> \n> - New positions: [P_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]  // Pk is still there, so length k+2?

It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? Not necessarily, because internal obstacles are given, so the grid might have obstacles inside. But borders are walls, so moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)] These are cells that are blocked, so I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So the snake is vertical, going down from (3,4) to (3,1). Head direction is U, which is up. But if head is at (3,4) and direction is U, that means it was moving up to (3,4), so next move could be U, L, R, but not D because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Head direction U means last move was up, so it came from below. Positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So if direction is U, it was moving up to (3,4), so previous position was (3,3) before moving up? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed head first: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]. So head is at (3,4), and it moved to this position from (3,3) by moving up, since (3,3) to (3,4) is up. So current head direction is U, meaning it was moving up to get to (3,4). Therefore, for the next move, I can go U (to (3,5)), L (to (2,4)), R (to (4,4)), but not D (to (3,3)) because that's instant reverse and not allowed.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 3 (so disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 21, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 23? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t+L-1, it disappears? Example: if at turn t, life span N, then on turn t, N decreases to N-1? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Re-reading: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, when food is spawned, it has life_span N. On the turn it is spawned, countdown is N. After that turn, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown reaches 0, and it disappears after that turn or at the end of the turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it is present for N turns.\n> \n> Let's clarify with an example. Suppose at turn t, food with life_span N is present. After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1. After turn t+1, to N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown is 1, then after turn t + N -1, it decreases to 0 and disappears? Or at turn t + N, it disappears.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After the turn, if eaten, it's gone; if not, life_span decreases by 1. If life_span was 1, after decrease, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". I think it's similar to: food is present for exactly N turns from its appearance.\n> \n> For this state, turn 21:\n> \n> Food: (1,5) value 1, life_span 3 → so it appeared on turn 19? Life_span 3 at turn 21 means it has 3 turns left, including turn 21. So after turn 21, life_span becomes 2; after turn 22, becomes 1; after turn 23, becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 21, 22, or 23.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) value 1, life_span 5 → appears on turn 17? Life_span 5 at turn 21, so it has 5 turns left: turns 21,22,23,24,25. Disappears after turn 25.\n> \n> (4,3) value 1, life_span 8 → life_span 8 at turn 21, so many turns left.\n> \n> All food here has value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 21 onwards.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7 for any y; all y=0, y=7 for any x.

Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In the context, snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) with head direction U, so moving up, meaning y increasing up? Usually in such games, y increases upwards, so (3,1) is low y, (3,4) higher y.\n> \n> Confirm: head at (3,4), moving U to (3,5) would be increasing y.\n> \n> Now, L: to (2,4) — (2,4) not in obstacles, not snake body, so possible.\n> \n> R: to (4,4) — (4,4) not in obstacles, not snake body, possible.\n> \n> D: to (3,3) — but (3,3) is the second segment, and since we can move into tail only if tail moves away, but here if I move D to (3,3), it would be collision because the body is there, and tail might not move away instantly.\n> \n> Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" — so since current direction is U, I cannot move D immediately.

It's turn 23. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I should plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it's moving left.

(1,5) is not listed as obstacle or snake body? Snake body is at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), so (1,5) is not occupied by snake. Obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (1,5) is not in obstacles, so it should be free, but there's food there.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) with life span 1. Since current turn is 23, and life span decreases every turn including current, so after this turn, if not eaten, it disappears. Life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 23 if not eaten on turn 23.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves forward, so length same. If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (1,5) eats food, so new positions: head at (1,5), then previous head (1,4) becomes body, so snake: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] but since we ate food, we add a segment, so the tail doesn't move. Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the new head is at the food cell, and the tail stays in place, so the snake lengthens by one.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head moves to (1,5), and since food eaten, the tail (3,3) does not move, so new body is: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and (3,3) still there? No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Before move: positions [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] — head (1,4), segment 2 (2,4), segment 3 (3,4), tail (3,3).\n> \n> After moving head to new position:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed from old position.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment added at tail, so tail position stays, and a new segment is added where the tail was, meaning the tail doesn't move, and the new head is added.\n> \n> Perhaps better to think in terms of the list.\n> \n> Initial: positions S = [H, B1, B2, T] where H=(1,4), B1=(2,4), B2=(3,4), T=(3,3)\n> \n> After move to new cell C:\n> \n> - If C has no food, then new positions: [C, H, B1, B2] and T is removed, so [C, (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)] and (3,3) is free now.\n> \n> - If C has food, then new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, T] or rather, since we grow, it's [C, H, B1, B2] and T stays, so effectively [C, (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] — yes, the tail is not removed, so it becomes a longer snake.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (1,5), which has food, so after move: head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> Now, the head direction: since I moved up, new head direction is U.\n> \n> But I need to think about future turns.\n> \n> First, is this move safe?

Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,5) and (3,3) are not adjacent; (1,5) to (3,3) is dx=2, dy=-2, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, (1,5) has food, and we're eating it, so it's fine.\n> \n> But life span: (1,5) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.

So yes, only U is possible.\n> \n> So for turn 23, I must move U to (1,5).\n> \n> Then, I eat the food, so snake grows to length 5: positions [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n> \n> Head direction now U.\n> \n> Now, turn 24.\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list all food and their life spans.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,5): life span 1, eaten on turn 23, so gone.\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 3, so disappears after turn 25? Countdown: on turn 23, life span 3, so after turn 23, life span 2; after turn 24, life span 1; after turn 25, gone. So must be eaten by turn 25.\n> \n> - (4,3): life span 6, disappears after turn 28? Turn 23: life 6, after t23:5, t24:4, t25:3, t26:2, t27:1, t28:0, gone after t28.

No.\n> \n> Initial positions: [A, B, C, D, E] where A=head, B=next, ..., E=tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell F, if no food, new positions: [F, A, B, C] and D and E are removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is left, and a new cell is occupied by head.\n> \n> So for list [A, B, C, D, E], after head moves to F, new list is [F, A, B, C] and D and E are no longer part of snake; E is removed, and D becomes the new tail?

Positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), tail (2,4). So (2,4) is the tail, but moving to (2,4) would be collision, because it's occupied by the tail segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"body collision (head touches any body segment)\" but note that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment only if the tail moves away, but in this case, if I move to (2,4), and (2,4) is the tail, but when I move, the tail will also move, but let's see.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is allowed, because after move, the tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, here, if I move down to (2,4), which is tail, it should be ok, because after move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, since no food eaten, the tail moves.\n> \n> Now, (3,5): not wall, not obstacle?

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let's confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, the borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells outside these are walls. The grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So movable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,4) with life_span=10 at turn 25, it will disappear after turn 34? Turn 25: countdown to 9, turn 26: to 8, ..., turn 34: to 0, disappears after turn 34? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, with life_span L, it will last for L turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1? For example, if life_span=1 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, then disappears before turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span=10 at turn 25: it can be eaten from turn 25 to turn 34, and disappears after turn 34 (so not on turn 35).\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 25, life_span=10, after turn 25, it becomes 9, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, as long as it's present when the head moves to it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. Head at (2,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,6) — but y=6? y=7 is wall, y=6 is within bounds? Grid y from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=6 is not wall, but let's check if it's obstacle.\n> \n> (2,6): is it wall or obstacle? Walls: borders are walls, internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) is not listed. Internal obstacles are only the points given, so (2,6) should be free, but y=6 is not border? y=7 is border wall, y=0 is border wall. So y from 1 to 6 are free except obstacles.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, x=1 to 6 playable except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,6), which is at x=3,y=6. So (2,6) is not obstacle, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is not in snake positions? Snake is at (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), so (2,6) is free.\n> \n> But let's confirm all:\n> \n> - U: (2,5) to (2,6)\n> \n> - D: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is part of snake body, so collision if I move there? (2,4) is the fourth segment, not the tail. Snake positions: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,4), which is occupied by the body, so it would be collision, death. So cannot move down.\n> \n> - L: left to (1,5) — but (1,5) is the second segment, body, so collision. Also, current direction is R, moving left would be reverse? But the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so moving left is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - R: right to (3,5) — (3,5) is what? Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) not listed, so should be free. Snake? Snake has (3,4), but (3,5) not occupied. So possible.\n> \n> So from (2,5), possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (2,6)\n> \n> - R: to (3,5)\n> \n> D and L not possible: D to body, L reverse and to body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or it disappears. Value +1.\n> \n> - (4,3): life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (4,1): life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (3,4): life span 10, value +1, but currently under tail.\n> \n> To eat (2,2), it's at (2,2), head at (2,5), so I need to go down, but from (2,5), down to (2,4) is body, impossible. Or via other paths.\n> \n> From (2,5), I can only go U or R.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,6), then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> (2,6): y=6, which is near top, but y=7 is wall above.\n> \n> Then from (2,6), I can go U, D, L, R, but not opposite if I came from down? Movement constraints: no instant reverse only for next move based on current direction.\n> \n> After moving, the head direction changes.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,6), then new head direction is U.\n> \n> Then from (2,6), possible moves: U, L, R, but not D (reverse).\n> \n> U to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, so invalid, death.\n> \n> L to (1,6): (1,6) is internal obstacle? Obstacles include (1,6), yes, (1,6) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> R to (3,6): (3,6) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> D to (2,5): but reverse, not allowed if current direction U.\n> \n> So from (2,6), the only possible move would be D, but if direction is U, D is reverse, not allowed. And other directions are blocked: U wall, L obstacle, R obstacle. So if I go to (2,6), I am trapped and die next turn. So moving U is suicidal.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move U; it's a dead end immediately.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (3,5).\n> \n> I must move R to (3,5).\n> \n> Then, at (3,5), new head position. Snake: after moving, head to (3,5), tail? When snake moves, head moves to new position, and each segment follows, so the tail moves away from (3,4) to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> After move R to (3,5):\n> \n> New positions: head at (3,5), then body: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). Tail was (3,4), but since snake moved, the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where tail was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So sequence: positions before move: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5):\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Then body: previous head (2,5) becomes first body segment\n> \n> - Then (1,5) becomes second\n> \n> - (1,4) becomes third\n> \n> - (2,4) becomes fourth, which was the third segment\n> \n> - And tail: since there were 5 segments, the last segment (tail) at (3,4) is left, but since head moved, the tail moves to the position of the previous tail segment? No.\n> \n> When snake moves forward, the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, snake length same, so after move, positions: head at new position, then the first body segment moves to where head was, second to where first was, and so on, so the tail is removed from its position.\n> \n> Specifically: new positions: head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: segment 1: (2,5)  // previous head position\n> \n> Segment 2: (1,5)  // previous segment 1\n> \n> Segment 3: (1,4)  // previous segment 2\n> \n> Segment 4: (2,4)  // previous segment 3\n> \n> Previous segment 4 (tail) was at (3,4), but since no growth, it is removed, so (3,4) is now empty.\n> \n> And food at (3,4) is still there, since not eaten.\n> \n> Now, at (3,5), head direction: since moved right, direction is R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U: to (3,6) — but (3,6) is obstacle, cannot\n> \n> - D: to (3,4) — (3,4) now has food, and it's empty? After move, (3,4) is free, and has food.\n> \n> (3,4) was tail, but tail moved away to (2,4)? Positions now: head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So (3,4) is free and has food with life span 10.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,4), I eat the food, since head moves to it, and it's positive food, so snake grows: new head at (3,4), and tail not removed, so new positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), and (2,4) becomes part of body? When eating food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> After moving to food cell, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place.\n> \n> Standard: if no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from old position.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, tail is not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> Here, if I move to (3,4), which has food, so I eat it, value +1, length +1.\n> \n> New positions: head at (3,4), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, and so on, down to the tail (2,4) remains, so positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: positions [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]  // after previous move to (3,5)\n> \n> Now move D to (3,4): which has food.\n> \n> So new head at (3,4)\n> \n> Then, since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the body segments remain: (3,5) becomes first body, (2,5) second, (1,5) third, (1,4) fourth, and (2,4) fifth, and since growth, a new segment is added where the tail was, but tail was at (2,4), and since not moved, it stays, but the snake grows, so the tail position is extended.\n> \n> After eating, the new tail is the old tail position, so positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), and tail at (2,4) still? No.\n> \n> The segments: the new head is at (3,4), then the previous head (3,5) is attached, then (2,5), then (1,5), then (1,4), and since we ate food, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving, but since tail didn't move, it's confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: before moving to (3,4), positions are P = [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ]\n> \n> When head moves to new cell (3,4), and eats food, so we add (3,4) as new head, and keep all body segments, so the snake becomes: [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ]? But that would have (2,4) twice? No.\n> \n> The segment that was tail at (2,4) is still there, and we add a new head, so positions: new head at (3,4), then the previous segments: (3,5) is now first body, (2,5) second, (1,5) third, (1,4) fourth, and (2,4) is still fifth segment, tail.\n> \n> But (1,4) and (2,4) are both present, but (1,4) is at index 3, (2,4) at index 4? Positions: index 0: head (3,4), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (2,4)? That can't be right because (1,4) to (2,4) is not adjacent; it's a corner.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake in the position list.\n> \n> Initially at turn 25: snake [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> After move R to (3,5): head to (3,5), then body: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). The tail (3,4) is removed, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Now, from here, move D to (3,4): (3,4) is now free and has food.\n> \n> Head moves to (3,4), eats food, so snake grows. New positions: head at (3,4), then the previous body: since food eaten, we keep the tail, so the segments are: new head (3,4), then the previous head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), and the tail (2,4) remains, but (1,4) is the fourth segment, and (2,4) is the fifth, tail.\n> \n> But the position (2,4) is occupied, and (1,4) is occupied, but in terms of connectivity, from (1,4) to (2,4) is diagonal? No, (1,4) and (2,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> In the list, positions are in order: after growth, snake is [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) ] with head at (3,4) and tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Now, back to the move: from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> Other moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U: to (3,6) obstacle, impossible\n> \n> - L: left to (2,5) — but (2,5) is body segment, collision\n> \n> - R: right to (4,5) — (4,5) is what? Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), etc, not (4,5). So (4,5) should be free. Snake?

So possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, check if moving to adjacent cells is safe.\n> \n> Adjacent cells from head (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) – is this wall? Internal obstacles include (3,6), which is a wall, so cannot move up.\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) – is this occupied? Snake body? Let's see: snake positions are (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). (3,4) is not in this list, so it might be free or food.\n> \n> (3,4) is a food position! Food at (3,4) with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) – but (2,5) is the first body segment, so if I move left, head goes to (2,5), which is occupied by body, but since the body will move, let's think about collisions.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move. But when moving, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it might be ok only if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard Snake: if head moves to a cell that will be free after the snake moves, it's ok. Specifically, after the move, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail becomes free, but other body cells remain occupied.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) tail.\n> \n> If I move head to a new position, the body follows, so the tail (2,4) will be left, and a new segment added if food eaten.\n> \n> But for collision: the head cannot move to a cell that is occupied by the body, except that it can move to the current tail position because the tail will move away.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, head can move to tail cell only if tail is moving away.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) – this is an internal obstacle, wall, so collision, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) – currently, what is there? Not occupied by snake body, and it's food. So if I move down, head to (3,4), which is free except for food.\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) – this is the first body segment at (2,5). Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> (2,5) is the segment right after head, so it's part of the body, not tail. Tail is at (2,4).\n> \n> If head moves to (2,5), which is occupied by the body, and since (2,5) is not the tail, it will not be vacated immediately; after move, the segment at (2,5) will become part of the body, so head colliding with it.\n> \n> Therefore, cannot move left to (2,5).\n> \n> - Right: (4,5) – what is this? Not in snake positions, not in wall list. Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,5) should be free. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (4,5) not there, so free.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (3,4) or Right to (4,5). Cannot Up or Left.\n> \n> Now, food available:\n> \n> - (4,3) at (4,3), life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (4,1) at (4,1), life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (3,4) at (3,4), life span 9, value 1\n> \n> (3,4) is directly below head, so if I move down, I eat it immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there's a danger about tail reward.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is tail? Tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Head at (3,5), tail at (2,4). Are they adjacent? Distance: |3-2|=1, |5-4|=1, so diagonal? Adjacent means sharing a side, I think. In grid, adjacent usually means up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So head (3,5) and tail (2,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be like (3,5) and (3,4) down, (3,5) and (3,6) up, (2,5) left, (4,5) right.\n> \n> Tail (2,4) is not adjacent to head; it's diagonally adjacent but not sharing a side.\n> \n> Therefore, no tail reward danger here since tail is not adjacent to head.\n> \n> Now, if I move down to (3,4), I eat the food there. Then snake grows, so new tail is added, positions become: head at (3,4), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, so [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] but (2,4) was tail, but since we ate food, we add a segment, so tail remains or new?\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position for that turn, but actually, the snake moves, head to new position, each segment follows, and if food eaten, tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: current positions: [H(3,5), B1(2,5), B2(1,5), B3(1,4), T(2,4)]\n> \n> If move down to (3,4), and eat food there, then new positions: head to (3,4), then the body: B1 moves to (3,5), B2 moves to (2,5), B3 moves to (1,5), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so T stays at (2,4), but a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> After moving: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. When food is eaten, the last segment (tail) is not removed, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> So before move: segments: S0: (3,5), S1: (2,5), S2: (1,5), S3: (1,4), S4: (2,4)  // S4 is tail\n> \n> After move down to (3,4) and eat food:\n> \n> - New head: (3,4)\n> \n> - S1 moves to S0 old position: (3,5)\n> \n> - S2 moves to S1 old position: (2,5)\n> \n> - S3 moves to S2 old position: (1,5)\n> \n> - S4 moves to S3 old position: (1,4)\n> \n> - And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before move, but after S4 moves, the new segment is added at the new tail position? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: after move, if no food, tail is removed. If food eaten, tail is not removed, and new head position added.\n> \n> Positions after move with growth: the new head position, followed by all previous positions except the tail is kept if food eaten? Better to think of the list.\n> \n> Previous positions: [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4] with P0 head, P4 tail.\n> \n> After moving in direction D to new head position P_new.\n> \n> If no food eaten, new positions: [P_new, P0, P1, P2, P3]  // P4 is removed\n> \n> If food eaten, new positions: [P_new, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4]  // all previous segments kept, and P4 is now part of body, new tail is P4? No.\n> \n> [P_new, P0, P1, P2, P3] and since food eaten, P4 is not removed, so the new list is [P_new, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4] with P4 as the new tail? But P4 was tail, now it's the second last, and a new segment? I think I have it.\n> \n> When snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - If no food eaten, the last position (tail) is vacated\n> \n> - If food eaten, the tail does not vacate; it stays, and the snake grows, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> Example: positions: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> Move to new cell N.\n> \n> If no eat: [N, H, B1] and B2 is removed?

When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, snake moves, head to new cell, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added at tail, so tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can only be eaten when the body moves away, meaning that cell is vacated, then later head moves to it.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) has food, but it's currently occupied by body segment 3.\n> \n> When the snake moves, depending on the move, this body segment will move to a new position.\n> \n> Let's see the current snake path.\n> \n> Positions: (4,3) head down, so next move.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) is below, at y=1.\n> \n> Life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 31, meaning it can be eaten on turn 29,30,31.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) has long life.\n> \n> But (3,5) is under body, so not accessible now.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> Options: move D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n> \n> If I move D to (4,2), then head at (4,2), and the body follows: the segment that was at (4,3) becomes body at (4,3)? After move, new head position, and body segments shift.\n> \n> After moving D to (4,2):\n> \n> - New head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Then body: the previous head position becomes body, so (4,3) is now body segment 1\n> \n> - Then previous segment 1 (4,4) becomes segment 2, so (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2 was (3,4), now segment 3 at (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 was (3,5), now segment 4 at (3,5)\n> \n> - But (3,5) has food, but since we didn't eat, it remains, but now segment 4 is at (3,5), still occupied.\n> \n> After move, the snake positions: head at (4,2), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). Tail is (1,5), and (1,4) is vacated since tail moved? Snake length 7, no food eaten, so head moves to (4,2), then the body: segment 1 moves to previous head (4,3), segment 2 moves to previous seg1 (4,4), segment 3 to previous seg2 (3,4), segment 4 to previous seg3 (3,5), segment 5 to previous seg4 (2,5), segment 6 to previous seg5 (1,5). Previous seg6 (1,4) is not part of snake anymore, so vacated.\n> \n> So now snake: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is still under the body, now segment 4 or 5? Positions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (1,5).

Walls: border y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not border? Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (4,1) is within bounds, x=4 between 1-6, y=1 between 1-6. Internal obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But when I move to (4,1) on turn 30, if I go that way.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> Another food at (3,5), which is occupied, but I can plan to eat it later.\n> \n> But it has long life, so not urgent.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (4,1) which is about to disappear soon.\n> \n> Life span 3, so I have until turn 31 to eat it.\n> \n> If I don't eat it soon, it will be gone.\n> \n> But is it worth eating? Value +1, but I need to consider risks.\n> \n> Now, from current position (4,3), if I move D to (4,2), then on turn 30 I can move D to (4,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But after eating, snake grows, so positions: after turn 30, head at (4,1), body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) and since ate, new tail added, so tail is where? When eating, the new segment is added at the end, so the previous tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Before eating, on turn 30, if I move to (4,1), from previous position, say after turn 29 I am at (4,2), so on turn 30, move D to (4,1), which is food, so eat, head to (4,1), body: the previous head (4,2) becomes body, and since ate, the tail doesn't move, so the snake becomes: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) and since ate, new segment is added, but where? The tail was (1,5), after growth, tail remains (1,5) and new segment is added after, so the new tail is (1,5), but positions: head (4,1), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (2,5), seg7 (1,5). Length 8.\n> \n> But (1,5) is still there, no change to tail position immediately.\n> \n> Now, potential danger: after eating, the head is at (4,1), which is near the bottom.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from there.\n> \n> But first, let's see if moving directly to (4,1) is safe.\n> \n> On turn 29, if I move D to (4,2), is (4,2) safe? What is around (4,2)?\n> \n> (4,2): no walls, no body now, since body is at (4,3) etc., all above.\n> \n> After move to (4,2), body is at (4,3), (4,4), etc., so (4,2) is head, no issue.\n> \n> Then turn 30 move D to (4,1), similarly, (4,1) was free, no body, so eating should be fine.\n> \n> But after that, head at (4,1), with body above.\n> \n> Now, from (4,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But D is down to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot move D.\n> \n> L to (3,1), R to (5,1), U to (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) is body, but when I move, if I move U to (4,2), which is now occupied by body segment, but since it's the segment that will move away, I think it's allowed only if it's the tail, but here (4,2) is not tail.\n> \n> Collision rules: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves.\n> \n> But when moving to a cell, if it's a body cell, it's collision unless it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake: moving into the tail is ok because tail moves, but moving into other body is death.\n> \n> Here: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

After move, (3,4) is occupied by body. Positions: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). So (3,4) is a body segment, not tail.

So these are cells I can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,3), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (3,3) from (4,3), I assume? Positions are given head first, so from (3,3) to (1,5), but head is at (3,3) and direction is L, which makes sense because the next segment is (4,3), which is to the right, so head moved left to (3,3).\n> \n> Let me list the snake segments in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,3)  // right of head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (4,4)  // up from (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,4)  // left from (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,5)  // up from (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (2,5)  // left from (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (1,5)  // left from (2,5)\n> \n> And head direction is L, meaning it was moving left when it arrived at (3,3).

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 30, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 31? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,1), life span 2 at turn 30. After turn 30, life span becomes 1; after turn 31, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) with value 1, life span 8. At turn 30, life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 37 (since 8 turns from now, including current? Countdown: start from 8, after turn 30: 7, after 31:6, ..., after 37:0, disappear. So available until turn 37.\n> \n> Value 1 for both, so positive food, +1 score and length increase.\n> \n> But there's a special case: food at (3,5) is on the snake's body! Look at snake positions: (3,5) is segment 4. So it's under the body.\n> \n> According to rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (3,5), which is currently occupied by the snake, to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (3,5), and then head moves there.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,5). Head is at (3,3), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) to (1,5): delta x=2, delta y=2, not adjacent; adjacent cells would be (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4) – but (3,4) is body, etc. Tail is (1,5), so adjacent to tail would be (1,4), (1,6), (0,5), (2,5) – but (2,5) is part of body, not tail end. Tail end is (1,5), so adjacent cells are (1,4), (1,6), (0,5), (2,5). (2,5) is segment 5, which is not tail; tail is last segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: indices: 0: head (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: tail (1,5).\n> \n> So tail is (1,5). Adjacent cells: (1,4) down, (1,6) up, (0,5) left, (2,5) right. But (2,5) is occupied by segment 5, so not empty.

Movement: U is (x,y+1), so if U is up, then y increases up. Similarly, D (x,y-1) down.

Walls include (2,3)? Internal obstacles list: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), etc. Yes, (2,3) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Up (U): (3,4) but (3,4) is segment 3, occupied by snake body, collision.\n> \n> - Down (D): (3,2) – is this free?

Not snake: snake at (3,3) etc, not (3,2). Food? Food at (4,1) and (3,5), not (3,2). So (3,2) should be free.\n> \n> - Right (R): but direction is L, and R is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. Cannot move right to (4,3), which is segment 1 anyway, collision.\n> \n> So possible moves: only Down to (3,2)? L to (2,3) is wall, U to (3,4) is body, R not allowed and body. Only D to (3,2) is possible? But let's confirm.\n> \n> Head direction L, so from (3,3), came from (4,3), so moving left.\n> \n> Possible actions: L, U, D.

Tail (1,5) is left, but since head moved, the tail moves, so the segment at (1,5) is removed, and new segment added at head?

At turn 31, life span 1, so if not eaten, after turn 31 it disappears? Countdown: at turn 30, life span 2; after turn 30, becomes 1; after turn 31, becomes 0 and disappears. So must be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n> \n> Turn 30: I moved to (3,2), not (4,1), so not eaten.\n> \n> Turn 31: if I move to (4,1), I can eat it.\n> \n> From current position at turn 31 start: head at (3,2), I can move directly to (4,1)? From (3,2), moving to (4,1) is not adjacent; adjacent moves are U, D, L, R to (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2). (4,1) is not adjacent to (3,2); to reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,2) first or (3,1), but (3,1) to (4,1) is right, not direct from (3,2).\n> \n> From (3,2), I can move to (4,2) or to (3,1), then from there to (4,1).\n> \n> If I want to eat on turn 31, I need to be adjacent to food and move there.\n> \n> (4,1) is adjacent to (4,2), (4,0) but y=0 wall, (3,1), (5,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is adjacent to (4,1)? (3,1) and (4,1) share x-diff 1, same y, so yes, adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is above (4,1), so adjacent.\n> \n> So from (3,2), I can move to (4,2) or to (3,1), both are one step from (4,1).\n> \n> But to eat on turn 31, I need to move directly to (4,1), which I can't from (3,2); I need to be at (4,2) or (3,1) first.\n> \n> So on turn 31, if I move to (4,2), I am at (4,2), then on turn 32 I can move down to (4,1) to eat, but (4,1) life span: after turn 31 it disappears, so on turn 32 it's gone. Must be eaten by turn 31.\n> \n> Life span at turn 30: 2, decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 30: food available, life span 2.\n> \n> After turn 30: life span decreases to 1 (still available for turn 31).\n> \n> After turn 31: life span decreases to 0, disappears, not available for turn 32.\n> \n> So to eat (4,1), must be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n> \n> Turn 30: I moved to (3,2), not (4,1), so not eaten.\n> \n> Turn 31: I need to move to (4,1) directly. But from head position at turn 31 start: (3,2), I can only move to adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2). None is (4,1), so I cannot move directly to (4,1) on turn 31. I need to be at an adjacent cell first.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat (4,1) on turn 31 because I'm not adjacent to it at the start of turn 31.\n> \n> At turn 31 start, head is at (3,2), food at (4,1) is at distance; not adjacent.\n> \n> To eat it on turn 31, I need to be at (3,1) or (4,2) or (5,1) or (4,0), but (4,0) wall, (5,1) may not be accessible.\n> \n> Since I'm at (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or to (4,2) on turn 31.\n> \n> If I move to (3,1) on turn 31, then I am at (3,1), and (4,1) is adjacent right, so on turn 32 I could move to (4,1), but turn 32 is after turn 31, and after turn 31, food disappears, so on turn 32 it's gone. Cannot eat on turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (4,2) on turn 31, then on turn 32 move to (4,1), but again, turn 32 too late.\n> \n> So, it is impossible to eat (4,1) food because by the time I can reach it, it will have disappeared.\n> \n> Turn 30: I could have moved to (4,1)? But from (3,3), I could only move to (3,2), not to (4,1). From (3,3), adjacent are (3,4) up, (3,2) down, (2,3) left wall, (4,3) right but body and not allowed reverse. So no way to reach (4,1) in one move from (3,3).\n> \n> Therefore, (4,1) food cannot be eaten; it will disappear unused. So I should ignore it.\n> \n> Now, only other food is at (3,5), value 1, life span 8 at turn 30, so available until turn 37.\n> \n> (3,5) is currently under snake body, so I need to move the snake away and then back to eat it.\n> \n> After turn 30, snake head at (3,2), and body includes (3,5).\n> \n> In new positions: head (3,2), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (2,5) — (3,5) is occupied.\n> \n> To eat (3,5) food, I need the snake to move so that (3,5) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is the position of seg5, which is part of body.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves away, so eventually (3,5) could be vacated if the snake moves and tail leaves it.\n> \n> But the food is at (3,5), so when the tail moves away, the cell is free, then head can move to it to eat.\n> \n> But the food might be under body, and when body moves away, it becomes accessible.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is occupied by a body segment, not tail yet.\n> \n> Let me see the snake body order.\n> \n> After turn 30: positions: index 0: head (3,2), 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5)\n> \n> So (3,5) is segment 5, which is the sixth segment, tail is (2,5).\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, tail (2,5) is removed, and head moves to new position, segments shift: segment 5 moves to old segment 4 position, etc.\n> \n> Specifically, when moving, if not eating, the cell that was tail is vacated, and each segment moves forward.\n> \n> To vacate (3,5), which is currently segment 5, it will be vacated when segment 5 moves to a new position, which happens when the snake moves and segment 5 becomes the position of segment 4 or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 31, I move from (3,2) to some direction.\n> \n> If I move to, say, (3,1) down.\n> \n> Then new head (3,1), seg1: (3,2), seg2: (3,3), seg3: (4,3), seg4: (4,4), seg5: (3,4), seg6: (3,5).

After move down to (3,1): positions: head (3,1), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (3,5). So (3,5) is now the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move right to (4,2): head (4,2), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (3,5). (3,5) is tail.\n> \n> In both cases, after one move, (3,5) becomes the tail position because the old tail (2,5) is removed.\n> \n> Then, since (3,5) has food on it, and it's now the tail, if I move the head to (3,5), I can eat it, but there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, after one move, (3,5) is the tail, and it has food.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,5), which is the tail, but since it's food, eating it means the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows, but the head is moving to the tail position.\n> \n> When you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> But if you move head to the tail cell, and eat the food, then the new head is at the old tail position, and since tail doesn't move, the new tail is the old tail segment, but it's now part of the body, and the head is there, so it might cause collision.\n> \n> Rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> I think it means that after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and head is on it, but since head moved to it, it's like the head is on the same cell as the tail was, but after growth, that cell has both head and the new tail? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Normally, when moving without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to next, but tail is not removed, so snake grows by one; the new tail is the former last body segment.\n> \n> In this case, if tail has food, and head moves to tail cell:\n> \n> - Before move: head at some position, tail at T with food.\n> \n> - Head moves to T.\n> \n> - Since food is eaten, tail is not removed; instead, the snake grows, so the new positions: head is at T, and the body includes all previous segments including the old tail, so now there are two segments at T? No.\n> \n> Let's think of positions.\n> \n> Suppose positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] with T having food.\n> \n> Head moves to T.\n> \n> Since food eaten, tail not removed, so new positions: [T (new head), H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] and Bk is new tail? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - Without eat: new head position, then body: [old head, ..., second last], tail removed.\n> \n> - With eat: new head position (food), then body: [old head, ..., tail], tail not removed, so new snake has one more segment.\n> \n> So when head moves to a cell with food, that cell is occupied by head, and the old positions are all shifted, but tail stays.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a cell that was not part of snake, it's fine.\n> \n> But if head moves to the tail cell:\n> \n> - Tail cell has food.\n> \n> - Head moves to tail cell.\n> \n> - Since food eaten, the tail segment is not removed; it becomes part of the body.\n> \n> - New head is at the cell that was tail.\n> \n> - The body includes the old head position and all others, including the old tail, which is now a body segment.\n> \n> - But the new head is at the same position as the old tail, which is now a body segment, so immediately, head collides with body segment, since that cell is now occupied by both head and the segment that was tail? No, in terms of cells, after movement, the cell has only the head, but in the body list, the old tail is still there at that cell, but since head moved to it, it should be that the cell is set to head, and the old tail is now a body segment at that cell, but that means two segments at same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> Yes, so it causes instant death because head and body collide at that cell.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to any body segment, it collides, but tail is special because it moves away normally.\n> \n> But when eating at tail, it doesn't move away, so collision.\n> \n> Hence the rule: if head moves to tail cell when there is food, it dies.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,5), after one move, it becomes the tail with food.\n> \n> Then, if I move head to (3,5), it would die.\n> \n> To eat (3,5) safely, I need to move such that the body moves away first, so that (3,5) is no longer occupied, then head can move to it when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is occupied by body segment.\n> \n> After one move without eating, the tail moves away, so (3,5) is now the new tail position, but still occupied.\n> \n> After two moves without eating, the tail would move further.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current state: positions: H(3,2), B1(3,3), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(3,4), B5(3,5), T(2,5)\n> \n> Food at (3,5), which is B5.\n> \n> After move 31, say we move down to (3,1), no eat (since no food there), so new positions: head (3,1), then body: old head (3,2) -> seg1, B1(3,3) -> seg2, B2(4,3) -> seg3, B3(4,4) -> seg4, B4(3,4) -> seg5, B5(3,5) -> seg6 (tail). T(2,5) removed.\n> \n> So now (3,5) is tail, with food.\n> \n> If we move head to (3,5) now, it would be moving to tail with food, causing death.\n> \n> To avoid that, we need to move such that (3,5) is vacated first.\n> \n> After another move, say turn 32, we move from (3,1) to somewhere, no eat, then tail (3,5) moves to the position of seg5, which is (3,4)?

Walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]. So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (4,2), and body segments are (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). The head direction is R, which means right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 7.

Indices: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's set coordinates.\n> \n> Assume (0,0) is bottom-left, but in grid terms, usually (0,0) is top-left or bottom-left? The problem doesn't specify, but for movement, it shouldn't matter. I'll assume (x,y) with x increasing right, y increasing up, so (4,2) is somewhere.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction right.\n> \n> Body: (4,2) head, then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5).

According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is the tail, so if the snake moves, the tail will move, so the food might be accessible if the head can get there after the tail moves.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see the current situation.\n> \n> Head is at (4,2), tail at (3,5). Are they adjacent? Let's see the distance. (4,2) to (3,5): delta x = -1, delta y = +3, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (4,2) and (3,5) are not adjacent; they are separated.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,5) with life span 7. Since the tail is on (3,5), and there's food, when the snake moves, the tail will leave (3,5) only if the snake doesn't eat food. If the snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; only the head moves to a new cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> But in this case, since there's food under the tail, if the snake eats it, it might cause a problem.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement and eating.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - If it moves to a cell with food, it eats it, grows by one segment, so the tail stays in place, and the head moves to the food cell.\n> \n> - If no food, it moves head to new cell, tail moves off the last position.\n> \n> But here, the food is under the tail, so for the head to eat it, the tail must move away first, meaning that in some move, the snake doesn't eat, so tail moves, then later head can move to that cell if food is still there.\n> \n> Also, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head is on food, tail is still there but now it's part of the body, and head is adjacent, but after eating, the snake grows, so the tail remains, and head is on the food cell, which was the tail position.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully:\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, specifically, if head is adjacent to tail (meaning |dx|=1 and dy=0 or |dy|=1 and dx=0), and the tail cell has food, then if the head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, after eating, the snake grows, so the head is now where the tail was, and the tail doesn't move, but since it grew, there's a new segment at the tail, so the head is adjacent to the new tail? After eating, the tail position remains, and a new segment is added, so the tail is still at the same place, but now it's not the tail anymore; the new tail is the segment before that, but since we added a segment, the position that was tail is now the second last segment.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions: head A, segment B, tail C. C has food. If head is adjacent to C, and moves to C, it eats food, so new positions: head at C (which was tail), then A, B, C (but C was tail, now it's part of body), and since we add a segment, the new tail is the old C? No.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and we add a copy or something.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, you grow by adding a new segment at the end, so the tail doesn't advance for that move.\n> \n> So positions: before eat, snake: [head, body..., tail]\n> \n> After moving to food: head moves to food, new segment added at tail position, so snake becomes [new head (food cell), old head, body..., tail, new tail (same as old tail position)] but since we add a segment, the tail position is the same, but now it's the second last, and the new tail is the old tail position with the segment added.\n> \n> Let's index:\n> \n> Suppose before move: segments: S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail)\n> \n> If move to empty cell: new head position, then S0 becomes S1, S1 to S2, ..., Sk-1 to Sk, Sk is removed.\n> \n> If move to food: new head position (food), S0 becomes S1, S1 to S2, ..., Sk to Sk+1, and add new segment at Sk position, so new tail is Sk position.\n> \n> In terms of positions, after eating, the tail position remains the same, but it is now the second last segment, and the last segment is the new one at the same position? No.\n> \n> When you eat, you add a new segment at the tail end, so after moving (to food), the head is at new position, and all segments shift: the old head becomes body, and so on, and since you add a segment, the tail stays where it was, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail position has two segments for a moment? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard implementation: when snake moves to a cell without food, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail is removed from its position.\n> \n> When snake moves to a cell with food, the head moves to the new cell (food), the tail is not removed, so the snake grows by one segment; the tail remains, and the new head is added.\n> \n> So positions: before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to food: [new H (food), H, B1, B2, ..., T]  so the tail T is still there, and snake is longer.\n> \n> So the cell that was T is now occupied by the second last segment, and the tail is still T.\n> \n> In terms of collision, the body includes all segments except the head.\n> \n> Now, for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, and head moves to tail cell to eat it.\n> \n> After eating: head is now at the tail cell, which was occupied by tail, but now head is there, and the old head is now body, and tail is still tail.\n> \n> But the tail cell had food, so after head moves there, it eats, so the snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays in place.\n> \n> But since head moved to the tail position, and tail is still there, but head and tail are the same cell? No, the tail is at its position, head moves to it, so they occupy the same cell, which is impossible, or collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> After eating, the head is at the food cell, which was the tail position, and since we grow, the tail remains, so effectively, the head and tail are on the same cell, causing immediate collision.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So if head moves to the tail cell to eat food, and head was adjacent, it causes collision because after eating, head and tail are co-located.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,5), which is the tail, and head is at (4,2), not adjacent, so it's safe to eat it if possible, but we need to move the tail away first.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,1), food.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (3,5) has life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 32 + 7 - 1? Turn 32: life span decreases, so at turn 32, life span is 7, meaning it has 7 turns left including current turn? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1?

So it has L turns left starting from turn t.\n> \n> For example, at turn 32, life span 7, so it will be there until turn 32 + 6 = 38? Let's say: after N turns from now, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from current, meaning at turn t + N it is gone.\n> \n> But countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, countdown is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for turn 32, life span 7, so:\n> \n> - Turn 32: countdown 7\n> \n> - After turn 32, countdown 6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 38, countdown 0, disappears before turn 39.\n> \n> So it is present on turns 32 to 38 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,1) life span 9: present on turns 32 to 40 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite direction).\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.

It's turn 33. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), and (1,6). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,2), then body segments: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is R, meaning right, so it was moving east to (5,2) from (4,2), I assume.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so it will disappear after 6 more turns? Life span is given as 6, and it decreases every turn, so at turn 33, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, including turn 33. So it will be gone after turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) with value 1 and life span 8, so it disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but probably more since food has life spans.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,2), direction R (right). So possible moves: since head is facing right, I can move right, up, or down, but not left because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Current direction is R, so I can't move L next.\n> \n> From (5,2), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Right: (6,2)\n> \n> - Up: (5,3)\n> \n> - Down: (5,1)\n> \n> But I need to check which are valid, not walls, not body except tail, and not out of bounds.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,2) is x=6, y=2, which is within bounds, x=6<7, y=2>0 and <7? Grid is from 0 to 7 inclusive? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free? No.\n> \n> \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see: for example, (5,2) is given, so x=5, y=2, which should be within bounds. x=5 is between 1 and 6? x=1 to x=6 should be free, since x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n> \n> Similarly for y.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (5,2) is given, and y=2, so y from 1 to 6 should be free, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles? But snake has (4,3) and (4,4), which are different.\n> \n> (5,3) is an obstacle, but let's list all obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So for (5,3), it's an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) obstacle.\n> \n> Now, from head (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Right: (6,2) - is this wall? x=6, y=2, x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not border wall.

But y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall, I think.\n> \n> \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so y=0 is wall, y=1 is not border, and (5,1) not in internal obstacles, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied?

(4,2) is the second segment, so if I move left, head to (4,2), which is occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> Unless it's the tail, but tail is (3,4), not (4,2).\n> \n> So only two possible moves: R or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) and (6,1).\n> \n> (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> (6,1) at x=6,y=1, value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> (6,1) is directly below (6,2)?

When I move, if I don't eat food, the tail moves, so snake shortens? No.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, snake moves forward, head to new position, tail end is removed, so length same.\n> \n> If I eat food, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I go to (6,2), I don't eat food yet, since (6,2) is not food.

Head direction is down, which is increasing y, I assume? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards or downwards? U is up, so (x,y+1) means y increases as we go up, I think. But let's confirm.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) – moving up increases y, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (5,1), direction D (down). Down is (x,y-1), so from (5,1) down would be to (5,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't go down.

After turn 34, it will have 4 left, and so on, disappearing after turn 38 or something? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1?

No.\n> \n> Standard: if not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If eating, head moves to new cell with food, body segments move as usual, but a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one, with new tail at old tail position.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So, after eating, the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move to (6,1) with eat, new positions: head (6,1), then the previous head (5,1) becomes seg1, then (5,2) seg2, (4,2) seg3, (3,2) seg4, (3,3) seg5, (4,3) seg6, and since it ate, the tail (4,4) remains, so new tail is still (4,4), but now it's part of the body, and new segment added? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions before move: [H: (5,1), B1: (5,2), B2: (4,2), B3: (3,2), B4: (3,3), B5: (4,3), T: (4,4)]\n> \n> After moving right to (6,1) and eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,1)\n> \n> - B1 moves to where H was, (5,1)\n> \n> - B2 moves to where B1 was, (5,2)\n> \n> - B3 moves to where B2 was, (4,2)\n> \n> - B4 moves to where B3 was, (3,2)\n> \n> - B5 moves to where B4 was, (3,3)\n> \n> - T moves to where B5 was, (4,3)\n> \n> Then, since it ate, a new segment is added at the position where T was before move, which is (4,4). So new positions: [ (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] — new tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Before move, T was at (4,4). After move, T moves to (4,3), and new segment added at old T position (4,4).\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), tail (4,4)\n> \n> Length 8 now.\n> \n> But (4,4) is still the tail, but it's the same cell, but now it's part of the snake.\n> \n> In this case, no issue.\n> \n> But we need to think about future turns.\n> \n> If I don't eat, move left to (4,1).\n> \n> Then no eat, so head to (4,1), body moves: B1 to (5,1), B2 to (5,2), B3 to (4,2), B4 to (3,2), B5 to (3,3), T to (4,3), and tail (4,4) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) ] — tail is (4,3), length 7.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> For turn 34, I can go L to (4,1) or R to (6,1) to eat.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (3,5) and (1,1).\n> \n> (3,5) is at (3,5), which is above and left.\n> \n> (1,1) is left and down, but y=1 is same row, x=1.\n> \n> Current head (5,1).\n> \n> Food at (3,5): x=3,y=5\n> \n> (6,1): x=6,y=1\n> \n> (1,1): x=1,y=1\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, which are above the head.\n> \n> Head at (5,1), so above: (5,2) is snake body, (5,3) obstacle, (5,4) obstacle, (5,5) might be free, but (5,6) obstacle.\n> \n> y=5, x=5: (5,5) not in obstacles, not wall, so free.\n> \n> But to reach (3,5), need to go left and up.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is at (1,1), which is left.\n> \n> Now, life span: (3,5) has life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 38.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 7, by turn 40.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 10, by turn 43.\n> \n> Turn 34 now, so (3,5) is urgent, only 5 turns left.\n> \n> (6,1) can be eaten now, but if I eat it, I might not be able to reach (3,5) in time.\n> \n> (1,1) has more time.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to (6,1) to eat.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,1), I eat, snake grows to 8, head at (6,1), direction would be R, since I moved right.\n> \n> Then from (6,1), possible moves.\n> \n> (6,1) is at right, x=6, y=1.\n> \n> Walls: x=7 is wall, so cannot go right to (7,1).\n> \n> Can go up, down, left.\n> \n> Up: (6,2)\n> \n> Down: (6,0) wall, invalid\n> \n> Left: (5,1) – which is now occupied by the body?

It's turn 35. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I should list all walls to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,1), then body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (6,1) from previous position. Since head is at (6,1) and direction is R, it came from left, so previous head was at (5,1) or something? Snake positions are given as [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]. So head is (6,1), next is (5,1), which is left, but direction is R? That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> Direction is \"Snake Head Direction: R\", which probably means the direction it is facing now, so from (6,1), it can move right, up, down, or left, but not left because that would be opposite to current direction? No, the rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so it can move U, D, R, but not L, because L is opposite to R.\n> \n> Opposite directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites. So from R, cannot move L immediately.\n> \n> Now, food positions: (3,5,4,1) – this might be a tuple. It says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for first food: (3,5) with value 1 and life span 4. Similarly, second food: (1,1) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> Food: (3,5) value 1, life span 4; (1,1) value 1, life span 9. Both are positive since value +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,5), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 35, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 38 (since turn 35:4, 36:3, 37:2, 38:1, then gone after 38? Or at turn 38 it becomes 0 and disappears? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is L, then at turn t, it has L, at t+1 it has L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1 it has 1, and then after that turn, it disappears, so it can be eaten until turn t+L-1.\n> \n> For (3,5) at turn 35 with life span 4, it can be eaten on turns 35,36,37,38 (since at turn 38, life span is 1, and after eating or after turn, it might be gone). Similarly, (1,1) with life span 9 can be eaten until turn 43.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,1), direction R. Possible moves: U (up to (6,2)), D (down to (6,0)), R (right to (7,1)), L (left to (5,1)). But L is opposite to R, so cannot move L because of no instant reverse. So only U, D, R possible.\n> \n> But (5,1) is the second segment, so moving left to (5,1) would cause collision? No, because the tail will move away. Let's think about collisions.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision except that moving into tail is ok because tail moves. But here, if I move left to (5,1), (5,1) is the next segment after head, so it's not the tail; the tail is at (4,4). Snake positions: indices: head (6,1), then (5,1) is segment 1, (5,2) seg2, (4,2) seg3, (3,2) seg4, (3,3) seg5, (4,3) seg6, (4,4) seg7 (tail? Positions: 0:head (6,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4) tail. So 8 segments, tail at (4,4).\n> \n> If I move left to (5,1), which is position of segment 1. But at the next turn, when head moves to (5,1), the body will shift, so segment 1 moves to where segment 2 was, and so on, tail moves away. So moving to (5,1) should be ok because it's only deadly if it's not the tail and the head touches it before it moves. But since the tail moves, only the cell that was tail might be ok to move into if it's not occupied later.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,1) is not the tail; it's the first body segment. So if head moves to (5,1), it would collide with segment 1 before it moves, so it should be a collision. Similarly, moving to any body cell except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) is occupied by the body, so moving left to (5,1) would cause collision because head touches segment 1.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other body cells would be bad.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - U to (6,2): is this free? Check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (6,2) is within bounds, x=6 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. So grid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so movable cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (6,1): x=6, y=1, which is on the bottom row? y=0 is wall, y=1 is first row.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, but internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So for (6,2): x=6,y=2.

After moving, the direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> After moving U, head direction becomes U.\n> \n> Then snake positions: after moving to (6,2), the body follows: tail was at (4,4), but when head moves to (6,2), the segment that was at (5,1) moves to where head was? Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (6,2), then the new positions: head (6,2), then the previous head (6,1) becomes the new segment 1, (5,1) becomes segment 2? Let's index.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,2):\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then segment 1: previous position of index 0, which was (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: previous position of index 1, (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: previous position of index 2, (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4: previous position of index 3, (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: previous position of index 4, (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: previous position of index 5, (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: previous position of index 6, (4,3)\n> \n> - Tail: previous position of index 7, but since tail was index 7, it moves to where index 6 was? The tail cell is abandoned unless food or something.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,2), then body: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> Previous tail (4,4) is now free, but since no food, it's empty.\n> \n> Snake length is still 8, no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2).\n> \n> But D is opposite to U, so cannot move D due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> R to (7,2): x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,2): (5,2) is now occupied by body? New positions: (6,2) head, (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), etc. So (5,2) is segment 3? Positions: 0: (6,2), 1: (6,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (5,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,3), 7: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> So (5,2) is segment 3, not tail. Moving to (5,2) would be collision.\n> \n> U to (6,3): is it free? (6,3) not wall, not snake? Snake has (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), etc., no (6,3), and no obstacle at (6,3), so should be ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6) — (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles.\n> \n> (6,3) not in list, so free.\n> \n> So from (6,2) with direction U, possible moves: U to (6,3) or L to (5,2) but L to (5,2) is occupied, collision, or R to (7,2) wall, D not allowed. So only U to (6,3) possible? That seems forced.\n> \n> Then move U to (6,3).\n> \n> New head (6,3), direction U.\n> \n> Positions: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (4,3)? Previous tail was (4,3), but after move: new positions: head (6,3), seg1: (6,2), seg2: (6,1), seg3: (5,1), seg4: (5,2), seg5: (4,2), seg6: (3,2), seg7: (3,3) tail? Index: 0: (6,3), 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (5,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3) — but (3,3) was previously segment 5, and (4,3) was tail but now gone? Previous positions before move: head (6,2), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (5,2), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,3), seg7 (4,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,3):\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Seg1: previous head position (6,2)\n> \n> - Seg2: previous seg1 position (6,1)\n> \n> - Seg3: previous seg2 position (5,1)\n> \n> - Seg4: previous seg3 position (5,2)\n> \n> - Seg5: previous seg4 position (4,2)\n> \n> - Seg6: previous seg5 position (3,2)\n> \n> - Seg7: previous seg6 position (3,3)\n> \n> - Tail: previous seg7 position (4,3), but since it was tail, it moves to where seg6 was, so (3,3) is now tail? Seg7 is now at (3,3), which was previous seg6 position.\n> \n> Previous seg6 was (3,3), and it becomes the new seg7?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game at Turn 36:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The game is played on an 8x8 grid (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)].\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (6,2), followed by body segments: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving Up (\"U\").\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (3,5): Value = +1, Life Span = 3 (will disappear after Turn 38).\n   - (1,1): Value = +1, Life Span = 8 (will disappear after Turn 43).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 36\n\nFrom the current head position (6,2) moving Up (\"U\"), the possible moves are Up (\"U\"), Down (\"D\"), Left (\"L\"), and Right (\"R\"). However, we must consider the constraints:\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Cannot move Down (\"D\") because it's the opposite of the current direction (\"U\").\n- **Wall Collision**: Cannot move into border walls or internal obstacles.\n- **Body Collision**: Cannot move into any body segment except the tail (since the tail will move away after the move).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (\"U\") to (6,3)**:\n   - Check if (6,3) is a wall or occupied by body:\n     - Not a border wall (x=6, y=3 is within bounds).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (not listed in internal obstacles).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (current body positions don't include (6,3)).\n   - **Valid Move**.\n\n2. **Down (\"D\") to (6,1)**:\n   - Opposite direction, so invalid due to \"No Instant Reverse\".\n   - Additionally, (6,1) is occupied by the second body segment, so collision.\n   - **Invalid Move**.\n\n3. **Left (\"L\") to (5,2)**:\n   - (5,2) is occupied by the fourth body segment (not the tail), so collision.\n   - **Invalid Move**.\n\n4. **Right (\"R\") to (7,2)**:\n   - x=7 is a border wall.\n   - **Invalid Move**.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 36**: Only valid move is Up (\"U\") to (6,3).\n\n### Simulating Moves for Subsequent Turns\n\nGiven that the only valid move at Turn 36 is \"U\", let's simulate the next few turns to see the sequence of forced moves:\n\n**Turn 36**: Move \"U\" to (6,3).\n- New head: (6,3).\n- New body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3).\n- Tail (4,3) is removed (since no food is eaten).\n- Direction remains \"U\".\n\n**Turn 37**: From (6,3), direction \"U\".\n- Possible moves:\n  - \"U\" to (6,4): \n    - Not a wall or obstacle.\n    - Not occupied by body.\n    - **Valid**.\n  - \"D\" to (6,2): Occupied by body (not tail), **invalid**.\n  - \"L\" to (5,3): (5,3) is an internal obstacle, **invalid**.\n  - \"R\" to (7,3): x=7 wall, **invalid**.\n- **Only move**: \"U\" to (6,4).\n\n**Turn 38**: From (6,4), direction \"U\".\n- Possible moves:\n  - \"U\" to (6,5):\n    - Free.\n    - **Valid**.\n  - \"D\" to (6,3): Occupied by body, **invalid**.\n  - \"L\" to (5,4): (5,4) is an obstacle, **invalid**.\n  - \"R\" to (7,4): x=7 wall, **invalid**.\n- **Only move**: \"U\" to (6,5).\n\n**Turn 39**: From (6,5), direction \"U\".\n- Possible moves:\n  - \"U\" to (6,6):\n    - Free.\n    - But let's check future moves from (6,6):\n      - From (6,6), possible moves:\n        - \"U\" to (6,7): y=7 wall, **invalid**.\n        - \"D\" to (6,5): Occupied by body, **invalid**.\n        - \"L\" to (5,6): (5,6) is an obstacle, **invalid**.\n        - \"R\" to (7,6): x=7 wall, **invalid**.\n      - **Dead end**: No moves from (6,6), leading to death next turn.\n    - **Avoid this move**.\n  - \"D\": Reverse, **invalid**.\n  - \"L\" to (5,5):\n    - Free.\n    - **Valid**.\n  - \"R\" to (7,5): x=7 wall, **invalid**.\n- **Only safe move**: \"L\" to (5,5).\n\n**Turn 40**: From (5,5), direction \"L\" (since last move was left).\n- Possible moves:\n  - \"U\" to (5,6): (5,6) is an obstacle, **invalid**.\n  - \"D\" to (5,4): (5,4) is an obstacle, **invalid**.\n  - \"L\" to (4,5):\n    - Free.\n    - **Valid**.\n  - \"R\" to (6,5): Occupied by body, **invalid**.\n- **Only move**: \"L\" to (4,5).\n\n**Turn 41**: From (4,5), direction \"L\".\n- Possible moves:\n  - \"U\" to (4,6):\n    - Free.\n    - **Valid**.\n  - \"D\" to (4,4):\n    - Free.\n    - **Valid**.\n  - \"L\" to (3,5):\n    - Free.\n    - **Valid**.\n  - \"R\" to (5,5): Occupied by body, **invalid**.\n- Multiple options: \"U\", \"D\", or \"L\".\n\nAt this point, we have some flexibility. Given that the food at (1,1) is unreachable within its lifespan (as determined by the previous analysis), the priority is to avoid dead ends and prolong survival.\n\n### Determining the Best Move at Turn 41\n\nFrom (4,5), let's evaluate the options:\n\n1. **\"U\" to (4,6)**:\n   - Future moves from (4,6):\n     - \"U\" to (4,7): y=7 wall, **invalid**.\n     - \"D\" to (4,5): Occupied by body, **invalid**.\n     - \"L\" to (3,6): (3,6) is an obstacle, **invalid**.\n     - \"R\" to (5,6): (5,6) is an obstacle, **invalid**.\n   - **Dead end**: No moves next turn, leading to death.\n   - **Avoid this move**.\n\n2. **\"D\" to (4,4)**:\n   - Future moves from (4,4):\n     - Can go \"D\" to (4,3), \"L\" to (3,4), or \"R\" to (5,4) (but (5,4) is obstacle).\n     - More options available, safer path.\n   - **Valid and safer**.\n\n3. **\"L\" to (3,5)**:\n   - Future moves from (3,5):\n     - \"U\" to (3,6): obstacle, **invalid**.\n     - \"D\" to (3,4): free.\n     - \"L\" to (2,5): free.\n     - \"R\" to (4,5): occupied by body, **invalid**.\n   - **Valid and provides options**.\n\nBetween \"D\" to (4,4) and \"L\" to (3,5), both are safe. Choosing \"L\" to (3,5) moves the snake towards the left side, which may open up more space for future moves.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above analysis, the sequence of moves from Turn 36 to Turn 41 is:\n\n1. **Turn 36**: \"U\" (only valid move)\n2. **Turn 37**: \"U\" (only valid move)\n3. **Turn 38**: \"U\" (only valid move)\n4. **Turn 39**: \"L\" (to avoid dead end at (6,6))\n5. **Turn 40**: \"L\" (only valid move)\n6. **Turn 41**: \"L\" (safe move towards left side)\n\n### Verifying Food Accessibility\n\nThe food at (3,5)\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 36 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 6), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (3, 5, 3, 1)\n\t- (1, 1, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 36 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Border: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n> - Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,2), then body segments: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 36, it will disappear after turn 38 (if we start counting from now, it has turns 36,37,38 to be eaten, so must be eaten by turn 38).\n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will disappear after turn 43 (36 + 8 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N-1 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L turns, from turn t to turn t + L - 1. For example, at turn 36, life span 3 means it will be gone after turn 38 (since 36,37,38 are the turns it exists).\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,1): life span 8, so exists from turn 36 to 43 (36 to 36+7=43? Turns: 36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43 — that's 8 turns, gone after turn 43.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> - Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So let's list all wall cells:\n> \n> - x=0: all y from 0 to 7\n> - x=7: all y from 0 to 7\n> - y=0: all x from 0 to 7 (but x=0 and x=7 covered, so corners are walls)\n> - y=7: all x from 0 to 7\n> \n> Additionally:\n> (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,6) is listed, and (5,6), etc.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head at (6,2), direction Up.\n> \n> Body: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> I'll make a grid with coordinates:\n> \n> Rows y from 7 to 0 (top to bottom), columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> But in programming, often y=0 bottom, but here it doesn't matter, I'll keep y=0 bottom, y=7 top as per coordinates.\n> \n> y=7 is top, y=0 is bottom, since walls y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> In movement, U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up, so y=7 is top, y=0 bottom.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So grid:\n> \n> y\\ x | 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7\n> -----|-----------------------------------\n> 7    | W    W    W    W    W    W    W    W  (y=7 wall)\n> 6    | W    .    .    .    .    .    .

Let's list by row.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So by row:\n> \n> y=6: (3,6), (5,6), (1,6)  [since (1,6), (3,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> y=1: (2,1)\n> \n> y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (5,3)\n> \n> y=4: (5,4)  [and (5,4) is at y=4]\n> \n> Also borders.\n> \n> Now y=2: no obstacles mentioned, but snake is there.\n> \n> y=5: no obstacles.\n> \n> y=7: all wall.\n> \n> y=0: all wall.\n> \n> Now snake: positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> So at:\n> \n> (6,2) head\n> \n> (6,1)\n> \n> (5,1)\n> \n> (5,2)\n> \n> (4,2)\n> \n> (3,2)\n> \n> (3,3)\n> \n> (4,3) tail\n> \n> Direction Up, so moving from (6,2) to up, which would be (6,3), but let's see what's at (6,3).\n> \n> First, I need to find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head at (6,2), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R but with constraints.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is Up, so cannot move Down immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Also, cannot move into walls or body, except tail if it moves.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except that if moving into tail, it might be ok because tail moves, but need to check.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it collides, except if that body segment is the current tail, because after move, tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,2):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,3)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by the body segment? Current positions: (6,1) is the second segment, so it's a body part.\n> \n> After moving, the snake moves: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> So, if I move Up to (6,3), head to (6,3), then body: (6,2) becomes new segment 2, (6,1) becomes segment 3, and so on, up to (3,3) moves to (4,3)? Let's trace.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (6,2), 1: (6,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (5,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,3), 7: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> If I move Up to (6,3), new head at (6,3). Then new body: segment 1: old head (6,2), segment 2: old segment 1 (6,1), segment 3: old segment 2 (5,1), segment 4: old segment 3 (5,2), segment 5: old segment 4 (4,2), segment 6: old segment 5 (3,2), segment 7: old segment 6 (3,3), and tail old segment 7 (4,3) is removed since no food eaten? When no food, tail is removed, so the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, and the tail cell is vacated. So the snake doesn't shorten; it stays the same length, but the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move, new positions: head at new position, then the first body segment is the old head position, second is old first body, etc., up to the new tail is the old second-to-last segment? Let's see.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is left empty. The body segments shift: the segment that was behind the head now occupies the head's old position, and so on, with the tail segment moving to the position of the previous tail-but-one, and the old tail position is freed.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's a collision. Because if you move to the tail, the tail moves away, so it's safe.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,2), moving:\n> \n> - U to (6,3): what is at (6,3)? Current positions: (6,3) is not occupied; snake is at (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So (6,3) is empty. Also, is it wall? x=6, y=3: y=3, x=6 is not a wall; walls are at borders and obstacles. Borders x=0,7 or y=0,7; internal obstacles include (5,3) but that's different. (6,3) is free.\n> \n> (6,3): x=6, y=3, not in obstacle list: obstacles are (1,3), (2,3), (5,3), etc., but (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, not (6,3). So (6,3) is free.\n> \n> - D to (6,1): but (6,1) is occupied by body segment, and it's not the tail; tail is (4,3). So moving to (6,1) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - L to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by body segment? Current positions: (5,2) is segment 3 or something. Positions: (6,2) head, (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), ... so (5,2) is the fourth segment? Indices: 0:(6,2), 1:(6,1), 2:(5,1), 3:(5,2), so (5,2) is segment 3, which is body, not tail. Tail is (4,3). So moving to (5,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> - R to (7,2): but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Therefore, from current position, only possible move is Up to (6,3), since Down, Left, Right are all invalid.\n> \n> Down to (6,1) is body, Left to (5,2) is body, Right to (7,2) is wall.\n> \n> So only U is possible?

Internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n- **Snake**: Positions [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] (head first). Head direction is Up (U).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,5): value=1, life_span=2 (disappears after Turn 38)\n  - (1,1): value=1, life_span=7 (disappears after Turn 43)\n  - (4,4): value=1, life_span=10 (disappears after Turn 46)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 37\nFrom the head position (6,3) with direction U, the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (6,4)\n  - Check: Not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by the snake's body. Valid.\n- **L (Left)**: (5,3)\n  - Check: Internal obstacle at (5,3). Invalid.\n- **R (Right)**: (7,3)\n  - Check: Border wall at x=7. Invalid.\n- **D (Down)**: Opposite of current direction U. Invalid.\n\n**Only possible move at Turn 37: U to (6,4).**\n\n### Simulating Turn 37\nMove U to (6,4):\n- New head: (6,4)\n- Body: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n- Tail (3,3) is removed (no food eaten).\n- Direction remains U.\n\n### Turn 38\nFrom (6,4), direction U:\n- Possible moves:\n  - U to (6,5): Valid (not wall, not obstacle, not body).\n  - L to (5,4): Obstacle at (5,4). Invalid.\n  - R to (7,4): Border wall. Invalid.\n  - D: Opposite direction. Invalid.\n\n**Only possible move at Turn 38: U to (6,5).**\n\nSimulate:\n- New head: (6,5)\n- Body: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)]\n- Tail (3,2) removed.\n- Direction U.\n\n### Turn 39\nFrom (6,5), direction U:\n- Possible moves:\n  - U to (6,6): Valid.\n  - L to (5,5): Valid (not wall, not obstacle, not body).\n  - R to (7,5): Border wall.

Invalid.\n    - L to (5,6): Obstacle. Invalid.\n    - R to (7,6): Border wall. Invalid.\n    - D: Opposite direction. Invalid.\n  - **Dead end!** No possible moves. Game over.\n\n#### Option 2: L to (5,5)\n- New head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n- Tail (4,2) removed.\n- Direction L.\n\n**Choose L to (5,5) to avoid death.**\n\n### Turn 40\nFrom (5,5), direction L:\n- Possible moves:\n  - U to (5,6): Obstacle. Invalid.\n  - D to (5,4): Obstacle. Invalid.\n  - L to (4,5): Valid.\n  - R to (6,5): Body segment at (6,5). Collision. Invalid.\n\n**Only possible move at Turn 40: L to (4,5).**\n\nSimulate:\n- New head: (4,5)\n- Body: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n- Tail (5,2) removed.\n- Direction L.\n\n### Turn 41\nFrom (4,5), direction L:\n- Possible moves:\n  - U to (4,6): Valid.\n  - D to (4,4): Food at (4,4). Valid and beneficial.\n  - L to (3,5): Valid (food at (3,5) expires after Turn 38, so empty now).\n  - R to (5,5): Body segment.

Impossible to reach by then (as shown above).\n- **(1,1)**: Distance from (4,4) is |1-4| + |1-4| = 6. Cannot reach by Turn 43 (only 2 moves left after Turn 41). Ignore.\n- **(4,4)**: Successfully eaten at Turn 41.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\nGiven the constraints and the need to maximize score while avoiding death, the optimal immediate action at Turn 37 is to move Up (U), leading to the sequence:\n\n1. **Turn 37**: U (only possible move)\n2. **Turn 38**: U (only possible move)\n3. **Turn 39**: L (to avoid dead end at (6,6))\n4. **Turn 40**: L (only possible move)\n5. **Turn 41**: D (to eat food at (4,4))\n\n### Conclusion\nThe immediate action at Turn 37 is to move Up (U), as it's the only valid move that leads to a sequence allowing the snake to eventually eat the positive food at (4,4) while avoiding collisions and dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 37. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is Up, which is consistent with moving from (6,2) to (6,3) since y increases by 1.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 37. The sequence should be for turns 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, etc. I have to think about long-term survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n> \n> (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, and snake has segments, but let's list all blocked cells.\n> \n> Blocked by walls or obstacles:\n> \n> - All border cells: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x.\n> \n> - Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,3) is an obstacle, but snake head is at (6,3), which is fine.

(5,1) to (5,2) is up, then (5,2) to (4,2) is left, then (4,2) to (3,2) left, then (3,2) to (3,3) up. So the snake is like: from head (6,3) down to (6,2), down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), up to (5,2), left to (4,2), left to (3,2), up to (3,3). Tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Head direction is U, meaning it just moved up to (6,3) from (6,2), I assume, since positions are head first.\n> \n> In the list, positions are [(6,3) head, (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail]. So from head to tail: (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3). So the snake is moving: from (6,1) to (5,1) was left, then to (5,2) up, then to (4,2) left, to (3,2) left, to (3,3) up. But current head is at (6,3) with direction U, so it came from (6,2) to (6,3) up.\n> \n> Food: (3,5), (1,1), (4,4)\n> \n> Life spans: (3,5) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 37, life span 2, it will disappear after turn 38?

Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,5) with life span 2 at turn 37: after turn 37, countdown to 1; after turn 38, countdown to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 7, so disappears after turn 43 (37+6? let's calculate).\n> \n> Turn t, life span L: it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1? Countdown starts at L, decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown = L.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown = L-1.\n> \n> After turn t+1, countdown = L-2, ..., after turn t + (L-1), countdown=0, disappears before turn t+L.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For (3,5) at turn 37, life span 2: can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n> \n> For (1,1) life span 7: can be eaten from turn 37 to 37+6=43? t to t+L-1, so turn 37 to 37+6=43? L=7, so turns: 37 (cd=7), 38(cd=6), ..., up to turn 43 (cd=1), after turn 43, cd=0, disappears. So eaten on turns 37 to 43 inclusive.\n> \n> Turn 37: cd=7, exists; turn 38: cd=6, exists; ... turn 43: cd=1, exists; after turn 43, cd=0, gone.

Moves were constrained by obstacles and no-reverse rules, with turn 39's left turn critical to evade a dead end at (6,6).

It's turn 38. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, let's see: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid has x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x are 1 to 6. Similarly y=1 to 6. But let's confirm: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" means that any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]. So these are also walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,4), then body segments: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, meaning moving towards increasing y, I assume. Standard coordinates: U is (x, y+1), D is (x, y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So head at (6,4), direction U, so last move was up to (6,4).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 6? The format is (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\" and then \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state it's written as (3,5,1,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? I need to check.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" and then \"- (3, 5, 1, 1)\" – this is ambiguous. Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\" but in the list it's shown as (3,5,1,1), (1,1,6,1), (4,4,9,1). And it says \"Value and Life Span\", so probably (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state, it's listed as (3,5,1,1), which might be shorthand for (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Given the header \"Value and Life Span\", and the example has three numbers: x,y, and then two more.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x, y, value, life_span). But value is 1 for all? Let's see: (3,5,1,1) – if value is 1 and life span 1, or vice versa?\n> \n> The core rules say: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it should be (x,y), value, life_span.\n> \n> But in the state, it's written as (3,5,1,1) which might be a tuple, but it has four elements. I think it's a typo in the representation; probably it should be read as the position (3,5) with value 1 and life span 1, similarly (1,1) with value 1 and life span 6? (1,1,6,1) – that has four numbers.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) or something. Let's look at the value: all have last number 1, and middle number different. (3,5,1,1) – life span 1, value 1? (1,1,6,1) – life span 6, value 1? (4,4,9,1) – life span 9, value 1? But the core rules say positive food has +1, negative has -1, but here all values are 1, so all positive? But it says value and life span.\n> \n> In the core rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for each food, it's position, then value, then life span.\n> \n> In the state, it's listed as (3,5,1,1), which might be misformatted; I think (3,5,1,1) means position (3,5), value=1, life_span=1. Similarly, (1,1,6,1) position (1,1), value=1, life_span=6? But it has four elements; perhaps it's a mistake in the way it's written. (1,1,6,1) – if it's (x,y, value, life_span) then for (1,1) value 6? But value should be +1 or -1 for positive or negative food.\n> \n> All values are 1 here, so probably all are positive food. But for (1,1,6,1), if value is 6, that doesn't match the rules. I think there's a inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps the state is listing (x,y, life_span, value), so for (3,5,1,1) : x=3,y=5, life_span=1, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1,6,1): x=1,y=1, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (4,4,9,1): x=4,y=4, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense, because value is 1 for all, meaning all are positive food with reward +1. And life span as given.\n> \n> Okay, so food:\n> \n> - (3,5): value +1, life span 1 (so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 38, life span 1, after turn 38 it will be 0, so disappears before turn 39? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn t, if life_span is S, it decreases during turn t, so after turn t, it becomes S-1. If S=1 at turn t, during turn t it is present, but after turn t, it disappears, so it can be eaten only on turn t if S=1.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,1): life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns 38 to 43, and disappears after turn 43? Let's think: at turn 38, life span 6, so after turn 38, it becomes 5, and so on, until after turn 43 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 38 to 43 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,4): life span 9, so it will be around for many turns.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,4), direction U, so last move was up to (6,4). Current possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" so since current direction is U, I cannot move D on this turn.\n> \n> So from (6,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,5)\n> \n> - D: not allowed, opposite direction\n> \n> - L: to (5,4)\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so R to (7,4) is invalid.\n> \n> Also, walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,4) is an obstacle? (5,4) is listed as internal obstacle.\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,4), moving to (5,4) would be L, but (5,4) is an obstacle? Let's list obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Yes, (5,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move to (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is obstacle, but I'm not moving there directly.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,4):\n> \n> - U: to (6,5) – is this valid? (6,5): x=6, y=5. Borders: x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: check if (6,5) is listed? Internal obstacles are: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (6,5) not listed, so should be free, but need to check if it's occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] so (6,5) is not in snake body, so should be free to move, unless it's a wall, which it's not.\n> \n> - L: to (5,4) but (5,4) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) but x=7 is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - D: to (6,3) but (6,3) is the second segment of the snake? Snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,3) is the first body segment. If I move D to (6,3), that is a body segment, but according to rules, body collision: \"head touches any body segment\" but there's an exception: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Now, what is the tail segment? Snake positions: indices: 0: head (6,4), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2) so tail is (3,2).\n> \n> If I move to (6,3), which is position index 1, not the tail.

No.\n> \n> The body segments follow: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, (6,4), but head is moving to (6,5), so new position: head at (6,5), then the first body segment is now at (6,4) (which was head), second body at (6,3) (which was first body), third at (6,2) (was second), fourth at (6,1) (was third), fifth at (5,1) (was fourth), but (5,1) was index 4, which is now the position for index 5?

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I should map these out mentally.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then body segments at (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2). So the snake is 8 segments long.

Similarly, y=7 is wall, but (6,6) is y=6, which is not y=7, so (6,6) should be ok? Grid is from 0 to 7, so y=7 is top wall, so (6,6) is within bounds since y=6 < 7, no: y=0 to y=7, so cells y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not a wall, it's playable.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is playable.\n> \n> So from (6,5):\n> \n> - Up: (6,6) – is this wall? y=6, not y=7, so no.

Snake positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), etc. So (6,4) is occupied by the body. But according to rules, I can move into the tail segment if it will move, but let's see.\n> \n> Rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Tail segment is (4,2), which is not adjacent to head. Head is at (6,5), tail at (4,2), far away.\n> \n> But (6,4) is the segment right after head, so it's the neck, not tail.

If I move down to (6,4), I hit segment [1], which is body, not tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving Down is not possible because it's opposite direction and also leads to immediate collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,5) with direction U:\n> \n> - Up to (6,6)\n> \n> - Left to (5,5)\n> \n> - Right to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> So only Up or Left are possible.\n> \n> Now, (6,6): is it free? No snake body there? Snake body: positions are (6,5), (6,4), etc., no (6,6). Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) not listed, so should be free. Walls: y=7 is wall, but (6,6) is y=6, so ok.\n> \n> (5,5): similarly, not in snake or obstacles.\n> \n> Food: (1,1) and (4,4), not near.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food and avoiding risks.\n> \n> But first, let's list possible moves for turn 39.\n> \n> Action at turn 39: I can choose U or L.\n> \n> If I go Up to (6,6), then direction becomes U.\n> \n> If I go Left to (5,5), direction becomes L.\n> \n> Now, I must think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (1,1) has life 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 39, so for (1,1), life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 39 + (6-1) = turn 44? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 39, life span is given as 6, meaning after 6 turns it will be gone. Countdown starts from N and decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Example: suppose at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, countdown decreases to L-1. After turn t+1, to L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, countdown to 0, and it disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> In this case, turn 39, food at (1,1) life span 6, so it will disappear at turn 39 + 6 = turn 45? Let's see:\n> \n> - Turn 39: life span 6 (after this turn, it decreases to 5)\n> \n> - Turn 40: life span 5 (decreases to 4)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 44: life span 1 (decreases to 0)\n> \n> - Turn 45: disappears, not present.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn 39 to 44 inclusive? At turn 44, if eaten, it's still there, since after eating, it decreases, but when eaten, it's consumed.\n> \n> The food is present until the turn when countdown reaches 0, but before the turn it is consumed.\n> \n> Typically, on the turn when head moves to it, if life span >0, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Then after eating, it disappears.\n> \n> But the countdown decreases each turn, so on turn when life span is 1, it can be eaten, and after that turn, it would have decreased to 0, but since eaten, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,4), life span 8, so disappears at turn 39 + 8 = 47?

Snake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2) tail. So (4,4) not in there. Obstacles: not listed. So free, and food.\n> \n> - L to (3,5): not wall, not in snake, obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - R to (5,5): but (5,5) is now body segment, occupied, and moving right would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> D to (4,4) is possible and has food.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (4,4), I eat the food, snake grows, so new tail added, length increases.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the sequence so far.\n> \n> Turn 39: L to (5,5)\n> \n> Turn 40: L to (4,5)  (only choice, as above)\n> \n> Now turn 41: I can choose U, D, or L.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,4), I eat the food at (4,4), which is positive, so score +1, length becomes 9.\n> \n> Then head at (4,4), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Now, after eating, the new tail will be added, so positions: head (4,4), then previous head (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), and tail (4,2) but since eaten, a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, the head is on food, it eats, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, you move to the food cell, and the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to food, the body moves as usual, but since food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, meaning tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Before move: positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> - Move head to new cell.\n> \n> - If new cell has food, eat it, and do not remove the tail segment (so tail stays, new segment added).\n> \n> - If no food, move tail forward, so tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 41, if I move head to (4,4), which has food, so after moving, head is at (4,4), the segment that was at (4,5) is now behind, and since food eaten, the tail (4,2) does not move, so new positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), and tail still (4,2)? But (4,2) was tail, and since no move, it stays, and a new segment is effectively added.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (4,4) and eat: head (4,4), then the previous positions from index 1 onwards, but tail not removed.\n> \n> Previous positions before move: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), tail (4,2) -- 9 segments? Let's count.\n> \n> After turn 40, head at (4,5), body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), tail (4,2). So positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2) -- that's 10 positions? Indices: 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (5,2), 9: (4,2) tail. So 10 segments? But initial was 8, and I haven't eaten yet.\n> \n> Initial at turn 39: snake positions 8 segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2) -- that's 8.\n> \n> Turn 39: move L to (5,5), so new head (5,5), body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), tail (4,2). Still 8 segments.\n> \n> Turn 40: move L to (4,5), new head (4,5), body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), tail (4,2)? (4,2) is tail, but when head moves, tail moves? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, the body follows: the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Standard: each move, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and if no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed, so length same.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, turn 39: head moves to (5,5), so new positions: head (5,5), then the first body segment moves to old head position (6,5), then (6,4) to (6,4)? List:\n> \n> Old positions turn 39 before move: [ (6,5) head, (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2) tail ]\n> \n> After move to (5,5): head to (5,5), then body segments: the segment that was at (6,4) moves to the position of the previous head, which was (6,5), but no: the body segments move to the position of the segment in front.\n> \n> Typically: the new position for segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i>0.\n> \n> So after head moves to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (6,4)) moves to old position of segment 0, which was (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (6,3)) moves to old position of segment 1, which was (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (6,2)) moves to old position of segment 2, which was (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (6,1)) moves to old position of segment 3, which was (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was at (5,1)) moves to old position of segment 4, which was (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was at (5,2)) moves to old position of segment 5, which was (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was at (4,2)) moves to old position of segment 6, which was (5,2)\n> \n> And since no food eaten, the tail is removed, but in this case, the last segment moves to (5,2), and the old tail position (4,2) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: head (5,5), then body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2) -- and tail is (5,2)?

Segment 7 moves to old position of segment 6, which was (5,1), so tail at (5,1).\n> \n> List:\n> \n> - Head to (4,5)\n> \n> - Body: seg1 to old head (5,5)\n> \n> - Seg2 to old seg1 (6,5)\n> \n> - Seg3 to old seg2 (6,4)\n> \n> - Seg4 to old seg3 (6,3)\n> \n> - Seg5 to old seg4 (6,2)\n> \n> - Seg6 to old seg5 (6,1)\n> \n> - Seg7 to old seg6 (5,1)\n> \n> And old seg7 (5,2) vacated.\n> \n> So positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail. 8 segments.\n> \n> Now turn 41: head at (4,5), direction L (since moved left last time).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> - U to (4,6): free, as earlier\n> \n> - D to (4,4): food, positive\n> \n> - L to (3,5): free\n> \n> If I move D to (4,4), I eat the food.

(5,1) to (5,2) is up, so the tail is at (5,2) moving up? Not sure about direction, but for movement, we care about positions.\n> \n> Available moves from head (5,5): since head direction is L, meaning last move was left, so I cannot move right (opposite) immediately. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but L is left, which is same as current? No.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning the snake is facing left, so moving left would be continuing in the same direction. But I can also turn, as long as not instant reverse.\n> \n> Instant reverse: if moving left, I cannot move right on the next turn.\n> \n> So from (5,5), with head direction L, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,6)\n> \n> - D: (5,4)\n> \n> - L: (4,5)  (since x-1)\n> \n> - R: (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied by body, and also R is opposite direction, so I cannot move right because it's instant reverse.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move R to (6,5).\n> \n> Moreover, (6,5) is occupied by the body, so even if I could, it's blocked.\n> \n> So available cells:\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - is this free? Let's check obstacles and body.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,6) is an internal obstacle? From list: (5,6) is an obstacle, yes.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6) is listed, so (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> - D: (5,4) - is this free? (5,4) is an internal obstacle? From list: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are obstacles, so (5,4) is blocked.\n> \n> (5,4) is an obstacle.\n> \n> - L: (4,5) - is this free? (4,5) not in obstacles, and not occupied by body? Body positions: (5,5) head, (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). So (4,5) is not in body, and not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls are borders, so (4,5) should be free.\n> \n> - R: (6,5) but occupied by body and also opposite direction, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (4,5)? U to (5,6) is obstacle, D to (5,4) is obstacle, L to (4,5) seems free, R invalid.\n> \n> But is there any other direction? Only four directions.\n> \n> So from (5,5), only possible move is L to (4,5).\n> \n> Is that right? (5,5) to U (5,6): (5,6) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> D (5,4): (5,4) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> L (4,5): let's confirm coordinates. Moving left decreases x, so from (5,5) to (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) not in obstacles: obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So (4,5) not listed.\n> \n> Not in body positions except head and body listed.\n> \n> Body: (6,5), (6,4), etc., (4,5) not there.\n> \n> Walls: borders, x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7, (4,5) is within, so yes, (4,5) is free.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (4,5).\n> \n> But I need to plan for multiple turns. For turn 40, action must be L, since no other choice.\n> \n> Then for subsequent turns, I can choose.\n> \n> But let's confirm the state.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n> \n> After moving L to (4,5), the new head position is (4,5), and the tail will move, so the body shifts.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell, and tail moves away, so the last segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since we're not eating food yet, length stays the same.\n> \n> So after moving to (4,5), new positions: head (4,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, so [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)] and tail was (5,2), but since tail moves, (5,1) becomes the new tail? Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (5,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5), the new body is from index 0 to 6, but shifted: new head (4,5), then segment 1: (5,5), segment 2: (6,5), segment 3: (6,4), ..., up to segment 7: (5,1), and tail segment 7 is removed, so the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head is at new position, then the first body segment moves to the old head position, second to old first body, and so on, so the tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> So here: new head: (4,5)\n> \n> Then body: position 1: old head (5,5)\n> \n> Position 2: old body 1 (6,5)\n> \n> Position 3: old body 2 (6,4)\n> \n> Position 4: old body 3 (6,3)\n> \n> Position 5: old body 4 (6,2)\n> \n> Position 6: old body 5 (6,1)\n> \n> Position 7: old body 6 (5,1)\n> \n> Old body 7 (5,2) is the tail, and since no food eaten, it is removed, so tail is now at (5,1).\n> \n> New positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n> \n> Tail at (5,1).\n> \n> Now, direction: since moved left, new head direction is L.\n> \n> But for next move, I can choose direction.\n> \n> Now, food items: (1,1), (4,4), (4,2)\n> \n> (1,1) at (1,1), life span 5, so must eat by turn 44.\n> \n> (4,4) at (4,4), life span 7, by turn 46.\n> \n> (4,2) at (4,2), life span 10, by turn 49.\n> \n> (4,2) is at (4,2), which might be accessible.\n> \n> Also, note that (4,2) is a food position, but let's see if it's under snake body.\n> \n> Current snake body: before move, at turn 40, positions include (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), etc.\n> \n> (4,2) is not in snake positions, so it's free to eat if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is free.\n> \n> (1,1) is free.\n> \n> Now, after move to (4,5), head at (4,5).\n> \n> From (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But head direction now L, since just moved left.\n> \n> So cannot move right (opposite).\n> \n> Possible: U (4,6), D (4,4), L (3,5), R (5,5) but (5,5) is now body, and also opposite direction, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> U: (4,6) - is this free? y=6, x=4.\n> \n> Walls: y=7 is wall, y=6 not border wall. Obstacles: internal obstacles include (3,6), (5,6), but (4,6) not listed, so should be free. Body: after move, positions: (4,5) head, (5,5), (6,5), etc., no (4,6), so free.\n> \n> D: (4,4) - this is a food position, and free? (4,4) not in obstacles, not in body positions.

So free.\n> \n> L: (3,5) - not in obstacles, not in body, should be free.\n> \n> R: invalid and occupied.\n> \n> So from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4), or L to (3,5).\n> \n> If I go D to (4,4), I eat the food at (4,4), since it's positive food, snake grows, length increases by 1.\n> \n> (4,4) has value 1, life span 7, so I can eat it now.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Similarly, there is food at (4,2), which is below.\n> \n> Also, (1,1) is far.\n> \n> But (4,2) is at (4,2), which might be reachable soon.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (1,1) must be eaten soon, within 5 turns, by turn 44.\n> \n> Current turn 40, after move to (4,5), it's turn 41.\n> \n> Turn 40: move to (4,5), now turn 41.\n> \n> At turn 41, head at (4,5).\n> \n> Food at (1,1) life span: at turn 40, life=5, turn 41 life=4, so must eat by turn 44 (life=1 at turn 44, gone at turn 45).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) at turn 40 life=7, turn 41 life=6, etc.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Since I have to move L at turn 40, let's set that.\n> \n> Action for turn 40: L to (4,5)\n> \n> Now for turn 41 and beyond.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Options: U, D, L.\n> \n> If I go D to (4,4), I eat the food. Then snake grows, so new tail is added, positions: head moves to (4,4), body: old head (4,5) becomes segment 1, then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and since ate food, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail is still (5,1), but new segment added where tail was, so positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) — now 9 segments, tail at (5,1).\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added at the position where tail was before move.\n> \n> Before move, tail at (5,1), head to (4,4), so body segments shift: new head (4,4), segment 1: old head (4,5), segment 2: old seg1 (5,5), ..., up to segment 8: old seg7 (5,1), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position, which is (5,1)? Old tail was (5,1), but after move, the segment that was tail is now part of body, and new tail is added at the previous tail position if not moved, but since tail didn't move, it stays, and new segment added.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, head moves to food cell, body follows, but tail stays in place, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: after moving to (4,4) and eating, new head (4,4), body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and tail was (5,1), but (5,1) is now the second last, and new tail added? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions: head (4,5), body1 (5,5), body2 (6,5), body3 (6,4), body4 (6,3), body5 (6,2), body6 (6,1), body7 (5,1) — tail is body7 at (5,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (4,4) with eat: new head (4,4), then body1: old head (4,5), body2: old body1 (5,5), body3: old body2 (6,5), body4: old body3 (6,4), body5: old body4 (6,3), body6: old body5 (6,2), body7: old body6 (6,1), body8: old body7 (5,1), and since ate, add new body9 at position of old tail, which is (5,1), but (5,1) is now occupied by body8, so new segment added where tail was before move, which is (5,1), but since body moved, it's vacant? Messy.\n> \n> Simpler: the cell that was the tail is vacated when snake moves without eating, but when eating, that cell is not vacated; instead, the snake gains a new segment there.\n> \n> So before move, tail at (5,1).\n> \n> Head moves to (4,4), then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the segment that was at (5,1) moves to where?

Head direction is down, which is D, meaning (x,y-1). Since head is at (4,4) and direction is D, moving down would go to (4,3), but let's see what's around.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including this one, so by turn 45 it's gone.\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8, so it lasts until turn 50.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 42.\n> \n> Available moves: since head direction is D (down), I can move L (left), R (right), or D (down), but not U (up) because that's the opposite direction.

Snake positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So (6,4) is a body segment, but (5,4) is not listed as a body segment; it's listed as an internal obstacle.\n> \n> Conflict: (5,4) is both an obstacle and not in snake positions? Snake positions don't have (5,4), so it must be solely an obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, other points: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6) are all obstacles, not part of snake.\n> \n> So wall cells: all border cells (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and these internal points.\n> \n> Now for possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - L to (3,4): is (3,4) a wall? x=3, y=4.

None at (3,4), so (3,4) should be free, but is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (4,4) head, (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So (3,4) not in list, so empty and not wall.

Cannot move there.\n> \n> - D to (4,3): (4,3) - not border, not internal obstacle (internal obstacles are listed, (5,3) is obstacle, but (4,3) not listed). Snake body: (4,4) is head, (4,5) is next, but (4,3) not in positions. So should be free. But let's confirm: positions are (4,4), (4,5), etc., so (4,3) is not occupied, and not wall. So D to (4,3) possible.\n> \n> But (4,3) is below (4,4), and direction is D, so moving down is fine.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,2) is below, but not immediately.\n> \n> Food at (4,2), which is two steps down from head?

So can be eaten on turn 42,43, or 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) has life span 8, so many turns.\n> \n> But (4,2) is closer to head now: head at (4,4), so moving down twice: to (4,3) then (4,2).\n> \n> (1,1) is farther: from (4,4) to (1,1), need to go left and down.\n> \n> But there are obstacles in the way.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) bottom left? Usually in coordinates, y=0 is bottom or top? In the state, snake positions: head (4,4), then (4,5) which is up, since y=5 > y=4, so y increases up, I think. Direction D is down, so (x,y-1), so y decreases down. So (4,5) is above (4,4), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,1) is bottom left, (4,2) is left bottom from center? (4,2) y=2, so row 2 from bottom.\n> \n> Now obstacles: list all walls.\n> \n> Border: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, (5,6) etc.\n> \n> Snake: positions from head to tail: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and bottom, with head at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - L to (3,4): free? (3,4) not wall, not body. Body: (4,4) is head, (4,5) is above, (5,5) right-up, etc. (3,4) not occupied. So yes.\n> \n> - D to (4,3): (4,3) not wall, not body, body has (6,3) but not (4,3), so free.\n> \n> - R to (5,4): (5,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> - U to (4,5): but (4,5) is the second segment of snake, so if I move up, head goes to (4,5), which is occupied by body, so collision. Also, U is opposite to current D? Current direction is D, so U is opposite, not allowed anyway. So not possible.\n> \n> So only L or D.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (4,3), then I am one step closer to food at (4,2). From (4,3), I can move to (4,2) next turn to eat it.\n> \n> But need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, eating (4,2): it's positive food, so snake grows by one segment. When I eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (5,1), not near head. Head at (4,4), tail at (5,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so (4,4) adjacent to (4,3), (4,5), (3,4), (5,4) but (5,4) wall. (5,1) is far, so no issue.\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), head at (4,3), then I can move to (4,2) to eat food.\n> \n> But is (4,2) accessible? From (4,3) to (4,2), moving down, direction would be D.\n> \n> (4,2) is not wall, not body? Body positions: after moving to (4,3), the snake will be: head at (4,3), then the previous head (4,4) becomes body, so positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]? When I move, the head moves to new position, and tail moves only if not eating. But when not eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Turn 42: start, snake positions: H=(4,4), B1=(4,5), B2=(5,5), B3=(6,5), B4=(6,4), B5=(6,3), B6=(6,2), B7=(6,1), B8=(5,1) tail.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,3), no food eaten, so new head at (4,3), then the body segments shift: the tail (5,1) is removed, so new positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). Tail is (6,1).\n> \n> B8 was (5,1), but since tail moves, (5,1) is vacated, and new tail is (6,1) which was B7.\n> \n> Positions after move: head to new position, then the previous positions except the tail is cut off.\n> \n> So: new head (4,3), then the first body segment is previous head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). And (5,1) is free now.\n> \n> Tail is (6,1).\n> \n> Now, from here, at turn 43, head at (4,3), direction is D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Now, (4,2) has food, and I can move down to (4,2) to eat it.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,2), I eat the food. Since it's positive, I grow, so when I move to (4,2), head is there, and I add a new segment, so tail doesn't move. The new segment is added at the end, so positions become: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). And (5,1) was already vacated, but since eating, tail stays, so (6,1) is still there, and new segment added, but where? The snake grows by adding a new segment at the tail position before moving? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively increasing length.\n> \n> In this case: before moving to eat, positions: head (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> After moving down to (4,2) and eating: head at (4,2), then the body includes all previous segments plus the tail stays, so new positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) — and since eating, we add a new segment, so the tail (6,1) is not removed, and a new segment is added after it? No, the new segment is added at the end, meaning the tail position is extended.\n> \n> After moving to food, the head is at food, and the tail remains where it was, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) — that's 10 segments now, with tail at (6,1).\n> \n> Previously 9 segments, after eating, 10 segments, tail at (6,1).\n> \n> Now, that seems fine.\n> \n> But is (4,2) safe?

Let's see the positions:\n> \n> The positions are listed from head to tail: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]\n> \n> Since head is at (4,3) and direction is D (down), that means the snake was moving down to (4,3), so previous head was at (4,4) before moving down to (4,3).

Old tail (6,2) is removed. So new tail is at (6,3)? New positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). Tail at (6,3).\n> \n> Length still 9.\n> \n> If move D to (3,2): new head (3,2), then body: seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (4,4), seg4 to (4,5), seg5 to (5,5), seg6 to (6,5), seg7 to (6,4), seg8 to (6,3). Tail was (6,2) removed, so new tail at (6,3). Positions: head (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,2) is close.

From there, possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) will be body segment after move? After moving to (3,4), the body includes (3,3), so moving back to (3,3) might be collision.\n> \n> After move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), etc. as above.\n> \n> So from (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,5): is (3,5) free?

Food? No food at (3,5), so empty.\n> \n> - D to (3,3): but (3,3) is occupied by seg1, which is not tail (tail is (6,3)), so moving to (3,3) would collide with seg1. Invalid.\n> \n> - L to (2,4): (2,4) not wall? Walls: x=2,y=4. Not border, internal: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), etc. (2,4) not listed, so should be free. Not snake, so possible.\n> \n> - R to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied by seg3? After move, positions: seg2 is (4,3), seg3 is (4,4)? Positions: index: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), etc. So (4,4) is seg3, not tail. Moving to (4,4) would collide. Invalid.\n> \n> So from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) or L to (2,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if we moved D on turn 44 to (3,2).\n> \n> After move D to (3,2): head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). Tail (6,3).\n> \n> From (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by seg1, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (3,1): (3,1) not wall? y=1, not border, internal obstacles: (2,1) is wall, but (3,1)? Internal obstacles listed: (2,1), but not (3,1), so (3,1) should be free, but is it border? y=0 is border, y=1 is not border wall, so (3,1) is empty, no snake, no food, so can move there.\n> \n> - L to (2,2): (2,2) not wall? Not border, internal: (2,1) wall, (2,3) wall, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - R to (4,2): (4,2) is food! Value +1, life span 6. And it's empty now? Not occupied by snake. So can move there to eat it.\n> \n> If we move to (4,2), we eat the food, so snake grows.\n> \n> Now, compare the two options for turn 44.\n> \n> If we move U, we go to (3,4), and then we can go to (3,5) or (2,4), but no immediate food, and we might get trapped or something.\n> \n> If we move D to (3,2), then next turn we can move to (4,2) to eat the food at (4,2), which has life span 6, so it will be there for a few turns, but since we can eat it next turn, it's good.\n> \n> Also, (4,2) is adjacent to (3,2), so from (3,2) move R to (4,2).\n> \n> But need to check if moving to (4,2) is safe.\n> \n> First, if we move D on turn 44 to (3,2), then on turn 45, move R to (4,2).\n> \n> At turn 45, head at (3,2), moving to (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) has food, so eat it, then snake grows: head moves to (4,2), new head, then body: since food eaten, tail does not move, so body segments: seg1 to old head (3,2)? Positions before move: head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc. up to (6,3).\n> \n> After move to (4,2): new head (4,2), then body: seg1 moves to old head (3,2), but since food eaten, no tail removal, so new segment added? Standard: when food eaten, head moves to new cell, body segments shift, but tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions: head (4,2), then seg1: old head position (3,2), seg2: old seg1 position (3,3), seg3: old seg2 (4,3), seg4: old seg3 (4,4), seg5: old seg4 (4,5), seg6: old seg5 (5,5), seg7: old seg6 (6,5), seg8: old seg7 (6,4), seg9: old seg8 (6,3), and since food eaten, no removal, so new tail is old tail? Old tail was (6,3), which becomes seg9, but since we add a segment, the tail is now seg9 at (6,3), but it was already there.\n> \n> After move: head at (4,2), then body: position of seg1 is (3,2) — which was head, now body. seg2: (3,3) — old seg1. seg3: (4,3) — old seg2. seg4: (4,4) — old seg3. seg5: (4,5) — old seg4. seg6: (5,5) — old seg5. seg7: (6,5) — old seg6. seg8: (6,4) — old seg7. seg9: (6,3) — old seg8. And since food eaten, we add a new segment? No: when food eaten, the tail does not advance, so the segment that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added at head, but in terms of positions, after movement, the tail is not removed, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Initially, 9 segments. After move with no food, 9 segments. With food, 10 segments.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new cell. If food there, it is eaten. Then body: each segment moves to the previous position, but if food eaten, the tail segment does not move (is not removed), so the segment that was tail remains, and the new head position adds a segment.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (4,2). Then the first body segment is at the previous head position (3,2). Second body segment at previous seg1 position (3,3), and so on, up to the tail: since food eaten, the previous tail position is still occupied, and it becomes the new second last or something.\n> \n> Previous positions: head (3,2), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (6,5), seg7 (6,4), tail (6,3) — since after move D, tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> After move R to (4,2) with food: new head (4,2). Then body: seg1: (3,2) — previous head. seg2: (3,3) — previous seg1. seg3: (4,3) — previous seg2. seg4: (4,4) — previous seg3. seg5: (4,5) — previous seg4. seg6: (5,5) — previous seg5. seg7: (6,5) — previous seg6. seg8: (6,4) — previous seg7. seg9: (6,3) — previous tail, and since food eaten, no removal, so seg9 at (6,3). But now we have 10 segments: head + 9 body? Positions: 10 cells.\n> \n> Head (4,2), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (5,5), seg7 (6,5), seg8 (6,4), seg9 (6,3). Tail at (6,3).\n> \n> Collision: when moving to (4,2), it was empty, no wall, so safe. No collision with body since (4,2) was free.\n> \n> Now, after eating, snake is longer.\n> \n> But we need to think about future moves.\n> \n> If we don't eat now, we might have other options.\n> \n> But (4,2) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current. Current turn 44, life span 6, so it will be there until turn 44 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> The food has a life span, which is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 44, life span 1 for (1,1), so it disappears after turn 44, meaning it can be eaten only on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 6 at turn 44, so it will disappear after turn 49 (since 44 to 49 is 6 turns: 44,45,46,47,48,49 — that's 6 turns, so after turn 49 it is gone).\n> \n> Turn 44: life span 6, so countdown 6, decreases to 5 on turn 45, to 4 on 46, ..., to 0 on turn 49, so it disappears after turn 49, meaning last chance to eat is turn 49.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 9, disappears after turn 44+9-1=52? Turn 44: life span 9, so on turn 45, life span 8, ..., turn 52: life span 1, turn 53: gone. So can be eaten up to turn 52.\n> \n> But back to decision.\n> \n> If we move D on turn 44 to (3,2), we can then eat (4,2) on turn 45.\n> \n> If we move U, we go to (3,4), and (4,2) might still be reachable later, but let's see the path.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,6), which is up and left.\n> \n> But with obstacles.\n> \n> Now, another thing: the grid has many obstacles, so space might be limited.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, but walls, so free cells.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> - Internal: (1,3), (2,3), (2,1), (1,6), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\n> \n> (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are walls, so at x=5, y=3,4,6 walls.\n> \n> Also (3,6) wall.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), but (4,3) is body, and (5,3) is wall, so the snake is near walls.\n> \n> Free areas: for example, left side: x=1,2 but with obstacles.\n> \n> y=1: (2,1) wall, so (1,1) might be accessible but food there disappearing.\n> \n> y=2: (2,2) free?

After move, if we move to (3,3), new head at (3,3), but body[0] will move to old head (3,2), so the cell (3,3) is now head, and body[0] moves to (3,2), so no collision because the body segment that was there moves away. But when we move head to (3,3), at the moment of move, (3,3) is occupied, so it would be collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the collision rule.\n> \n> From the problem: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, head can move to tail position safely, because tail moves away.\n> \n> But if head moves to a non-tail body segment, it will collide because that segment doesn't move away immediately; it only moves after, but at the time of move, the cell is occupied.\n> \n> In the movement, when you decide to move, the head tries to occupy the new cell. If that cell has a body segment (except tail), it's collision. If it has tail, and you move there, it's ok because tail moves.\n> \n> Also, if it has food, you eat it.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,2), possible cells:\n> \n> - (3,3): occupied by body segment (3,3), which is not tail. Tail is at (6,3). So moving to (3,3) would cause collision because it's a body segment.\n> \n> - (3,1): down, (3,1). Now, is (3,1) valid? y=1, which is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7. y=1 is within 1 to 6, so valid, but is there obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) is not listed, so should be free. But (3,1) is not occupied by snake or obstacle? Snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), etc., not (3,1), so free.\n> \n> - (2,2): left, (2,2). Is it wall? x=2, y=2, not border. Obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), but (2,2) not listed, so free. Snake? Not occupied.\n> \n> - (4,2): right, (4,2). Now, (4,2) has food! Food at (4,2), with value 1, life span 6. So moving to (4,2) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> Also, (4,2) is not occupied by snake; snake head is at (3,2), body starts from (3,3), so (4,2) is free except for food.\n> \n> Now, is (4,2) under snake body?

Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 45, life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning on turn 51 it will be gone? Let's see.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 45, countdown is 6. After turn 45, it decreases to 5, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears, I assume at the end of that turn or beginning of next.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify when it disappears, but probably at the start of the turn when countdown reaches 0, or after.\n> \n> To be safe, assume that at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including t, so it disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 45, life span 6, so it is present on turns 45,46,47,48,49,50. After turn 50, it disappears, so not available on turn 51.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,6) life span 8, present turns 45 to 52, disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (6,3), and there is a food at (4,2) which is adjacent?

Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,2) adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2). Tail at (6,3), which is not adjacent, so no danger for this food.\n> \n> Now, let's consider options for turn 45.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (4,2) to eat the food immediately.\n> \n> If we eat, snake grows: new head at (4,2), then body: old head (3,2) becomes new body[1], then (3,3) body[2], ..., up to (6,3) body[8], and new tail at old tail (6,3)? When eating, length increases.\n> \n> Positions before move: head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) so 9 segments.\n> \n> After moving R to (4,2) which is food:\n> \n> - New head: (4,2)\n> \n> - New body[1]: old head (3,2)\n> \n> - New body[2]: old body[0] (3,3)\n> \n> - New body[3]: old body[1] (4,3)\n> \n> - New body[4]: old body[2] (4,4)\n> \n> - New body[5]: old body[3] (4,5)\n> \n> - New body[6]: old body[4] (5,5)\n> \n> - New body[7]: old body[5] (6,5)\n> \n> - New body[8]: old body[6] (6,4)\n> \n> - New body[9]: old body[7] (6,3)  // new tail, since old tail was (6,3), but now it's body[9], and since we ate, new segment added, so body[9] is at old tail position.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3) tail.\n> \n> After eating at (4,2):\n> \n> - New head: (4,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 (3,3)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 (4,4)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 (4,5)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old segment 5 (5,5)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old segment 6 (6,5)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old segment 7 (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old segment 8 (6,3)  // this is the new tail, position (6,3)\n> \n> So snake now has segments: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> And head direction: since we moved right, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, after eating, we have score +1, length 10.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term.

Since it's turn 45, it has 6 turns left, so we can eat it later, but we might lose it if we wait.\n> \n> Life span 6 at turn 45, so available until turn 50 inclusive? Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn 45: countdown 6, turn 46:5, turn 47:4, turn 48:3, turn 49:2, turn 50:1, then after turn 50, countdown 0, so disappears before turn 51?

Then, I planned a sequence moving right (to (5,2), (6,2)) and up (to (6,3), (6,4)) to navigate toward open areas on the right side of the grid, minimizing collision risks with the body or obstacles while keeping options open for future turns. This approach balances immediate reward with long-term survival by steering clear of tight spaces and leveraging the snake's current position.\n",

No, x=0 to x=7 means 8 cells in x-direction, same for y. But typically, coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive would be 8x8. Let me confirm: x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 – that's 8 columns. Similarly for y. But the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the border cells are walls, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can be in cells where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6? Let's see the snake positions: (4,2), (3,2), etc., all between 1 and 6, so playable grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y, so 6x6 grid internally.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). x from 3 to 6, y from 2 to 5. Head is at (4,2), direction is R (right), so last move was to the right.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)].

Turn 46 current, life span decreases each turn, so at turn 46, life span 7, so it will disappear at the end of turn 52? Let's think: at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N turns, so from turn t to t+N-1, it exists, and disappears at turn t+N. So for (2,6), turn 46, life span 7, so exists until turn 52 (46+6), and disappears at turn 53? Better to think: after turn 46, life span decreases to 6 at turn 47, and so on, to 0 at turn 53, when it disappears. Similarly for (6,5), life span 10, so disappears at turn 56.\n> \n> But we need to think about eating it before it disappears.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,2), direction R.

Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is not wall, but there might be obstacles. Obstacles: (2,1), (1,3), etc., but (4,1) is not listed, so should be free. But let's check if it's occupied by snake or wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2) head, (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).

So cannot go U.\n> \n> - Down to (4,1): (4,1) is not in snake positions, not a wall (since walls are borders and obstacles), obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So (4,1) is free? x=4,y=1, not in obstacles, and not border wall. Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,1) is within 1-6 in both, so should be free. But is it safe? We need to consider if moving there causes issues.\n> \n> - Right to (5,2): (5,2) is not in snake positions? Snake has (5,5), (6,5), etc., but not (5,2). Also not an obstacle. Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), but (5,2) not listed.

No, when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail is cut off.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the last segment (tail) is removed, unless eating food.\n> \n> But here, no food eaten, so length same.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) ] 10 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,2):\n> \n> New positions: head (5,2), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,2), so (4,2) now body, then (3,2) moves to previous position of next, which is (3,2) was after (4,2), but the segments: index 0: (4,2), index 1: (3,2), index 2: (3,3), etc.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,2)\n> \n> Then segment that was index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so to (4,2)\n> \n> Segment that was index 2 moves to where index 1 was, so to (3,2)\n> \n> Segment that was index 3 moves to where index 2 was, so to (3,3)\n> \n> Index 3 was (4,3), moves to where index 2 was, which is (3,3)?

It's turn 47. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,2), and the body segments are: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So the tail is at (6,4). Snake head direction is R, meaning it just moved right to (5,2), since previous position was (4,2), and moving right increases x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current one, so for (2,6), at turn 47, life span 6, it will disappear after 6 turns, so on turn 53 it should be gone? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be there until turn t + N - 1, I think. The problem says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is L, then after one turn, at turn t+1, life span is L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So for (2,6), life span 6 at turn 47, so it will be there until turn 52 (since 47 to 52 is 6 turns: turn 47,48,49,50,51,52; at turn 53, it's gone). Similarly, (6,5) life span 9 at turn 47, so disappears after turn 55.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for turns 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, etc., but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence for at least 5 turns. The answer format should include actions for multiple turns starting from t1=47.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,2), direction R.

So allowed moves: U (up, to (5,3)? y+1 is U, so from (5,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1), R to (6,2), or L to (4,2). But L is opposite to R? Current direction is R, so moving L would be left, which is opposite, so not allowed. Only U, D, R are possible, since L is reverse.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so for turn 47, I cannot move L.

Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, so tail moves forward or stays depending.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), the new positions: head at (6,2), then the previous head (5,2) becomes body, so positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] and the tail (6,4) is removed? No.\n> \n> Snake has 10 segments: from head to tail, 10 cells.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, the snake grows only if it eats food; otherwise, the tail moves off its position.\n> \n> Currently, no food eaten, so when head moves to (6,2), the tail (6,4) is removed, and the new positions are: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and since tail was (6,5)? Tail is (6,4), so after move, the segment that was at (6,4) is no longer part of snake; the new body is from the old head position onwards.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So here, snake positions: indices: 0: (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (6,5), 9: (6,4)  // tail is index 9.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2), new positions: head (6,2), then body: old 0 becomes new 1: (5,2), old 1 becomes new 2: (4,2), old 2: (3,2) new 3, old 3: (3,3) new 4, old 4: (4,3) new 5, old 5: (4,4) new 6, old 6: (4,5) new 7, old 7: (5,5) new 8, old 8: (6,5) new 9, and old 9 (6,4) is removed. So tail is now at (6,5), which was previously occupied, but now it's the tail.\n> \n> (6,5) has food, but it's now the tail position. To eat the food at (6,5), the head needs to move there when it's not occupied, but now it's occupied by the tail.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (6,2), the cell (6,5) is now the tail, so it's still occupied, but if the tail moves away later, it might be eatable.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 47, if I move to (6,2), no food eaten.\n> \n> If I move D to (5,1): new head (5,1), then body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), and tail (6,4) removed. So tail now at (6,5), which has food.\n> \n> (6,5) has food and is now tail.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,5) can be eaten if the head moves to it when it's free, but it's currently tail.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (6,5), with food.\n> \n> If I move to (6,2), head is at (6,2), tail at (6,5). Are they adjacent? (6,2) and (6,5), y differs by 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so same x, y diff 1 or same y, x diff 1.\n> \n> (6,2) and (6,5) are not adjacent; they are 3 apart vertically.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) and (6,5) are not adjacent.\n> \n> For turn 47, both moves seem possible.\n> \n> But let's think about future turns.\n> \n> I need to consider the food and plan to eat them safely.\n> \n> First, food at (2,6): positive, life span 6, so must eat by turn 52.\n> \n> Distance from current head (5,2) to (2,6): Δx=3, Δy=4, so Manhattan distance 7, but with obstacles, it might be longer.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,5): but it's currently occupied, and will be tail after move, but life span 9, so we have time.\n> \n> (6,5) has life span 9 at turn 47, so disappears after turn 55, plenty of time.\n> \n> But it's under the body, so we need to free it first.\n> \n> After any move, the tail is at (6,5) with food.\n> \n> If I move to (6,2), tail at (6,5); if I move to (5,1), tail at (6,5).\n> \n> Let's say I move to (6,2) at turn 47.\n> \n> Then positions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), tail (6,5)\n> \n> Food at (6,5) is under tail, so to eat it, tail must move away, then head move there.\n> \n> Tail at (6,5), which has food.\n> \n> Now, for the snake to eat the food at (6,5), it needs to move the tail away from (6,5), so that (6,5) becomes free, then head can move to it.\n> \n> But when the tail moves away, it means the snake is moving, so (6,5) is vacated, and if head is adjacent, it can move there immediately or later.\n> \n> But after moving, tail is at (6,5), and head at (6,2).\n> \n> From head (6,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction: after moving R to (6,2), direction is now R? Head direction is the last move, so from (5,2) to (6,2) is R, so direction R.\n> \n> Cannot move L (left) to (5,2), but (5,2) is now body, so cannot move there anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,2): U to (6,3), D to (6,1), R to (7,2), but x=7 is wall, so R invalid. L to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, and also L is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, moving L would be opposite, so not allowed. So only U or D possible.\n> \n> U to (6,3): is (6,3) free? Not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, but (6,3) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: after move, head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), etc., tail (6,5), so (6,3) not occupied.\n> \n> D to (6,1): y=1, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied.\n> \n> So from (6,2), I can go U or D.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved D to (5,1) at turn 47, head at (5,1), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> But let's think about the food at (2,6).

Let's list all free cells or something.\n> \n> Perhaps I should focus on the food at (6,5) first since it's closer and has longer life, but it's under the body.\n> \n> After turn 47, if I move to (6,2), tail at (6,5) with food.\n> \n> To eat the food at (6,5), I need the tail to move away, so that (6,5) is free, then head can move to it.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,5), and it will move when the snake moves, but the tail moves only if the head moves and no growth, so each move, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> From the position after turn 47 move to (6,2): snake: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), tail (6,5)\n> \n> Now, when the snake moves next, say turn 48, head moves to new position, then tail moves off (6,5), so (6,5) becomes free, but only if the head doesn't eat food or something.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, if it doesn't eat food, the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> Then, if that cell has food, it is still there, but since it's vacated, it can be eaten later if head moves there.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 48, after moving head from (6,2), the tail at (6,5) is removed, so (6,5) is free and has food.\n> \n> Then, if the head is adjacent to (6,5), it can move there to eat it.\n> \n> But at turn 48, head is at (6,2), which is not adjacent to (6,5); they are 3 apart in y.\n> \n> So from (6,2), if I move U to (6,3), then positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), tail was (6,5) removed, so new tail is (5,5)? After moving head to (6,3), the new body is old head (6,2) as first body, then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and old tail (6,5) removed, so the last body is (5,5), which becomes tail.

So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Snake: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> Food: (2,6) and (6,5)\n> \n> (6,5) is both snake tail and food location. So food is under the tail.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,2), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head is moving right, I can go U, D, R, but not L because L is left, opposite to R, and \"no instant reverse\" rule, so cannot move left immediately.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I can move U, D, R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around head (6,2):\n> \n> - Up: (6,3) - is this free? y=3, x=6. Check if wall, obstacle, or body.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (6,3) not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, but (6,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). So (6,3) is not occupied by snake body. Similarly, (6,1) is down, but y=1, not wall, and not in obstacles or body? (6,1): x=6,y=1. Not in obstacles, snake has (6,2) and (6,5), not (6,1). Body has (6,2) and (6,5), but (6,1) is empty.\n> \n> List all snake positions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). So cells occupied: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\n> \n> So for head at (6,2):\n> \n> - Right: (7,2) - but x=7 is wall, so collision, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Up: (6,3) - not wall, not obstacle, not body, so free.\n> \n> - Down: (6,1) - y=1, not wall (y=0 is wall, so y=1 is ok), not obstacle, not body (body has (6,2) and (6,5), not (6,1)), so free.\n> \n> - Left: (5,2) - but (5,2) is the second segment of the snake, so moving left would hit the body. Also, left is opposite to current direction right, so cannot move left anyway due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: U (up to (6,3)), D (down to (6,1)), or R (right to (7,2) but wall, impossible). R is impossible because (7,2) is wall.\n> \n> Therefore, only U or D are possible moves now.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,6) and (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is the tail, and it has food under it. To eat it, the tail must move away, and then head moves there. But currently, head is at (6,2), tail at (6,5), not adjacent.\n> \n> Moreover, if head were adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it would be dangerous, but here head is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Distance: head (6,2), tail (6,5), same x, y difference 3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right, so (6,2) and (6,3) would be adjacent vertically, but (6,5) is at y=5, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,5) has life span 8, so it will stay until turn 56, plenty of time.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) has life span 5, so it disappears after turn 52? Turn 48 current, life span 5: it disappears after N turns, including current, so after 5 turns from now, it will be gone. Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L, then turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So it disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> Example: if life span is 1, it disappears after this turn, so not available next turn.\n> \n> If life span is 2, at turn t, countdown 2, turn t+1 countdown 1, turn t+2 it disappears, so available for turns t and t+1.\n> \n> General: food with life span L at turn t is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> In the input, it's given at turn 48, so for (2,6): value 1, life span 5, so available from turn 48 to 52 (inclusive), disappears at turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): value 1, life span 8, available from turn 48 to 55, disappears at turn 56.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,2), only can move U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns: turns 48,49,50,51,52.\n> \n> But since food at (2,6) disappears after turn 52, I might want to eat it before it's gone.\n> \n> (2,6) is at x=2,y=6. Head at (6,2), so it's far, and there are obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,5) is under tail, but I need to move tail away first.\n> \n> First, let's list all free cells and possible paths.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, walls on borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Snake occupies: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> Food: (2,6), (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied by tail, so not accessible yet.\n> \n> To eat (6,5), the tail must move away. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if I move in a way that the tail leaves (6,5), then (6,5) becomes free, and if head moves there later, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food is on (6,5), so when tail moves away, the food is still there, and head can eat it by moving to that cell.\n> \n> But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger only if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food; eating it causes collision because after eating, tail grows and occupies the previous tail position, but head is there, so collision.\n> \n> Here, head is not adjacent to tail, so if I can get head to (6,5) after tail moves away, it should be fine.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (6,5), and it will move when the snake moves. The snake moves one step at a time; head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move; new segment added at head.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can only be eaten when body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,5), when the snake moves, the tail at (6,5) will move to the next position, which depends on the movement.\n> \n> Current snake positions: index 0: head (6,2), 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: tail (6,5)\n> \n> When snake moves, say to a new head position, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, segment 9 (tail) moves to where segment 8 was, and the old tail position (6,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Then, if there is food at (6,5), it is now exposed, and head can move to it later to eat it.\n> \n> But after moving, the tail is at a new position. Let's see the body connections.\n> \n> From positions: head (6,2) to (5,2) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5).\n> \n> So the tail (6,5) is connected to (5,5), so when snake moves, if head moves, say, up to (6,3), then new head is (6,3), then segment 1 moves to (6,2), segment 2 to (5,2), ..., segment 8 moves to (5,5), segment 9 (tail) moves to (6,5)? No.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head to new pos, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (6,3):\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: was (5,2), moves to where head was, (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: was (4,2), moves to where seg1 was, (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: was (3,2), moves to where seg2 was, (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4: was (3,3), moves to where seg3 was, (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: was (4,3), moves to where seg4 was, (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: was (4,4), moves to where seg5 was, (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: was (4,5), moves to where seg6 was, (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 8: was (5,5), moves to where seg7 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 9: tail was (6,5), moves to where seg8 was, (5,5)\n> \n> So new tail is at (5,5), and (6,5) is vacated. Since food is at (6,5), it is now free, and can be eaten if head moves to it.\n> \n> But head is now at (6,3), which is above (6,2), and (6,5) is at y=5, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (6,1), similar thing, tail moves to (5,5), (6,5) vacated.\n> \n> But head at (6,1) or (6,3), far from (6,5).\n> \n> Now, to eat (6,5), I need to get the head to (6,5) at some point after it's vacated.\n> \n> Since it's vacated after this move, from turn 49 onwards, it might be available.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two choices at turn 48: U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n> \n> If I go U to (6,3), head to (6,3), then snake becomes: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), and (6,5) is free with food.\n> \n> Similarly, if go D to (6,1), head to (6,1), snake: head (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), ..., up to (5,5) tail, (6,5) free.\n> \n> Now, from there, I can try to reach the food at (6,5) or at (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) has limited time, life span 5, so available until turn 52.

Food positions: (2,6), (6,5), (1,4) – (6,4) not food, so no eat.\n> \n> Snake new positions: head at (6,4), then the body: since head moved from (6,3) to (6,4), the segment that was at (6,3) becomes part of body, so positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] but tail was (5,5), which moves to where? The tail moves forward only if no food eaten; since no eat, tail is removed.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and no food, the tail is removed, so the new tail is the previous second last, but positions shift.\n> \n> Initial positions: indices 0 to 9: 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving Up to (6,4), head is now at (6,4). The body segments follow: segment 1 (6,2) stays, but actually, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, but since head moved, the new position 1 is the old head position (6,3), then position 2 is old position 1 (6,2), position 3 old position 2 (5,2), and so on, up to position 9 old position 8 (4,5), and tail old position 9 (5,5) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — but (4,5) was position 8, now position 9? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: previous head position (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: previous segment 1 (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: previous segment 2 (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4: previous segment 3 (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: previous segment 4 (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: previous segment 5 (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: previous segment 6 (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8: previous segment 7 (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 9: previous segment 8 (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 10: previous segment 9 (5,5) — but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so we have only 9 segments? No.\n> \n> Snake had 10 segments. After moving without eating, head moves to new cell, all body segments shift forward, and the tail cell is vacated. So the new snake has the same length, but positions: the last segment (tail) is removed, so the snake shortens by one segment? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is left, and snake has one less cell? No, in terms of positions, the head is new, each subsequent segment takes the position of the previous segment in the list, so the last segment (tail) is discarded, meaning the snake loses one segment only if it doesn't eat, but in terms of length, when no eat, length remains the same? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Let's clarify the rules from the problem.\n> \n> The core rules say: when eating positive food, length +1; when eating negative, length unchanged; no mention of length change when not eating. So when not eating, length unchanged, meaning the snake moves, head to new position, and tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is free now.\n> \n> In terms of positions, for a snake of length L, after moving to a new head position without eating, the new positions are: new head, then positions 0 to L-2 of the old positions, but shifted: new position 1 is old position 0, new position 2 is old position 1, ..., new position L-1 is old position L-2, and old position L-1 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So the snake still has length L, but the tail cell changes.\n> \n> In this case, L=10, after move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (6,3)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 (6,2)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 (5,2)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 (4,2)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old segment 5 (3,3)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old segment 6 (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old segment 7 (4,4)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old segment 8 (4,5)  -- tail\n> \n> Old segment 9 (5,5) is removed, so it's no longer part of snake.\n> \n> So new snake: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n> \n> Length still 10? Positions: 10 positions? Head and 9 body segments, so 10 cells.\n> \n> Old: 10 positions, after move, new head added, tail removed, so still 10 positions.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,4), and direction was Up, but after moving, the new head direction depends on the move. For the next move, the current direction is the direction I just moved, which is Up.\n> \n> For turn 50, head at (6,4), direction Up.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,4):\n> \n> - Up: to (6,5)\n> \n> - Down: to (6,3) — but (6,3) is now the first body segment, so it's occupied, and moving Down would collide with body. Also, it's reverse direction from current Up, so forbidden.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (7,4) — x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible: Up to (6,5) or Left to (5,4)\n> \n> But (5,4) is an obstacle? Obstacles: (5,4) is in the list, yes, (5,4) is internal obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> Therefore, only Up to (6,5) is possible.\n> \n> (6,5) is food!

It's turn 50, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? Let me confirm the grid size. The border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Since it's a grid, cells go from (0,0) to (7,7), but x=7 and y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see: border cells are x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7. So x=0 and x=7 are vertical walls, y=0 and y=7 are horizontal walls. So the grid has rows and columns from 1 to 6? Coordinates: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to y=6. Let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7) are walls, (7,0) to (7,7) walls, (0,0) to (7,0) walls, (0,7) to (7,7) walls. So the playable cells are where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? But let's see the snake positions: head at (6,4), which is within x=1-6, y=1-6? (6,4): x=6, y=4. Since x=7 is wall, x=6 should be playable if it's not border. Similarly, y=4, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=4 is fine.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n> \n> So head is at (6,4), direction is U (up). So moving up increases y, I assume? Typically in grids, y increases up or down? In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is north, I think.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 50, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 52? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns.

(5,4) is an obstacle, but (6,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6): x=2,y=6, not border, internal obstacles have (3,6) and (1,6), but not (2,6), so should be free.\n> \n> (1,4): x=1,y=4, not border, obstacles have (1,3) and (1,6), but (1,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Now, (6,5) is adjacent to head, I could eat it immediately by moving U.\n> \n> But I need to consider risks.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (6,5), I eat the food, snake grows to length 11, new tail will be added, so positions become: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) and new segment, so tail is still (4,5) until it moves, but after eating, when head moves to food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Food mechanics: when head moves onto food cell, it eats it, length increases by 1, and the new segment is added at the end, so tail position stays the same for that turn, but next turn when snake moves, the tail moves.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after eating, the new tail is where the tail was, but since head moved, it might not collide immediately.\n> \n> Specifically for (6,5), if I move U to (6,5), I eat it, head now at (6,5), body includes (6,4), (6,3), etc., and tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, is there any collision? Head at (6,5), body: (6,4) is adjacent but not same cell, so no collision.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,5), which has food? (4,5) is a snake body part, not food position. Food is at (2,6), (6,5), (1,4), so (4,5) has no food, so no issue.\n> \n> So moving U to (6,5) seems safe and gives +1.\n> \n> But I should think long-term. There are other food, and I need to survive.\n> \n> (2,6) has short life, only 3 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is easy to get now.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 50: U, L, R.\n> \n> U: to (6,5), eat food, grow to 11.\n> \n> L: to (5,4), but (5,4) is an internal obstacle?

After eating at turn 50, when head moves to (6,5), it eats, so the body grows, so positions: head (6,5), then the previous head (6,4) becomes body, so segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) and since it grew, the tail is still (4,5), but now length 11, so when it moves next, tail will move.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 51 start, positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, from (6,5), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (6,6): should be free, no obstacle, not body.\n> \n> L to (5,5): (5,5) not occupied, no obstacle.\n> \n> R to (7,5): but x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (6,4): but (6,4) is body, and reverse direction?

Snake positions: head at (5,5), body segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake is 11 units long. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (5,5) from (6,5) I assume, since the previous position was (6,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> - (1,4) with value 1, life span 7\n> - (5,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,6), life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 52 if not eaten now. Since we're on turn 52, and life span decreases every turn including current, if we don't eat it this turn, it will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) has life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 52 + 7 - 1?

When the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes empty. But (5,2) is not the tail; it's in the middle. So to make (5,2) empty, I need the snake to move such that the segment at (5,2) advances, and no new segment is added there unless I eat.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the cell (5,2) will be vacated only when the segment that was there moves to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head, the segment at index 1 moves to where head was, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on, down to the tail, which is removed.\n> \n> So for cell (5,2), which is currently index 5, after one move, the segment that was at index 5 will move to index 4's position, which is (6,2) in current state?

From above, after move, new S[6] is old S[5], which is (5,2), so (5,2) is still occupied, but by the segment that was previously at (5,2), so the cell doesn't change.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) remains occupied as long as there is a body segment there, which there is until that part of the body moves forward.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at (5,2) will move to where the previous segment was when the snake moves.

Both are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turns 53, 54, 55, etc., thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid with walls and snake.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, all y=0, all x=7, all y=7.

No.\n> \n> When snake moves: head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail or something, but in this case, if head moves to (5,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment, after head moves to (5,5), that segment will move to where the head was or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but other body cells are still occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail will cause collision, because after movement, that segment is still there or moves to a different cell? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start, all cells occupied by snake are blocked.\n> \n> When you move the head to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell is a wall or a body segment (except the tail segment in some cases), it dies.\n> \n> - The tail segment will move only if no food is eaten, so the cell it was in becomes free, but only after the move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for t to t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N, after turn t, it decreases by 1, so at turn t+1, life span N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, life span 1, then at turn t+N, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (1,4): life span 6 at turn 54, so present turns 54 to 59, gone at 60.\n> \n> For (5,2): life span 8 at turn 54, present turns 54 to 61, gone at 62.\n> \n> But (5,2) is currently under snake body, specifically, it's occupied by the segment at index 7: (5,2). When the snake moves, the body will move, so if the tail moves away, it might be eatable later.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is free now.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (3,3), and head is at (3,5), so they are two cells apart vertically.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding walls and body.\n> \n> Since I must think long-term, I should consider going for (1,4) or for (5,2) later.\n> \n> First, from current position (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n> \n> If I move L to (2,5), that might be towards (1,4), since (1,4) is left and down.\n> \n> (2,5) to (1,4) is down-left, but I can only move one cell at a time.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,4), that is down, towards the bottom.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout to find paths.\n> \n> List all walls:\n> \n> Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So, for example, (5,3) and (5,4) are walls, which block the right side.\n> \n> Also (1,3) and (2,3) walls, so left bottom is blocked.\n> \n> And (3,6) wall top, etc.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Food at (1,4) and (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied, so I need to wait for the body to move away.\n> \n> The snake is moving, so each turn, when I move, the tail will also move, depending on the path.\n> \n> The tail position changes based on the head movement.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (3,4), then the new head is (3,4), and the tail will move forward, so the segment at (3,3) will be the new tail or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]\n> \n> If I move down to (3,4), new head is (3,4), then the body follows: the first segment after head was (4,5) moves to (3,5), but since head moved to (3,4), the body shifts: new positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).

It's turn 55, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, and (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, there are internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,4), and direction is D (down). The body segments are: (3,4) head, then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). So the tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (1,4), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 55, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 59? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So for (1,4) at turn 55, life span 5: after turn 55, it becomes 4; after turn 56, 3; after turn 57, 2; after turn 58, 1; after turn 59, 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 55 to 59.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life span 7: from turn 55 to 61? After turn 55, 6; ... after turn 61, 0, disappears. Turn 55: L=7, after turn 55: L=6, after turn 56: L=5, ..., after turn 61: L=0, gone. So available turns 55 to 61.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 10: available turns 55 to 64.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,4), direction down. From (3,4), moving down would go to (3,3), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current dir is D, I cannot move U (up) next turn, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body, the second segment. If I move up, head goes to (3,5), which is where the body is, but since the snake moves, the tail will move, so it might not be a collision if it's the tail cell, but let's see.\n> \n> General rule: head touches body segment except the tail, because tail moves. But in this case, (3,5) is not the tail; it's the segment behind the head. Snake positions: index 0: head (3,4), index 1: (3,5), index 2: (4,5), ..., index 10: (3,2) tail.\n> \n> If I move up to (3,5), that's where the body segment at index 1 is. But after movement, the head moves to (3,5), and the body should shift, so the segment that was at (3,5) would move to... let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if I move up to (3,5), the head was at (3,4), moves to (3,5). Then the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where? The new head is at (3,5), which was previously occupied by body segment 1. After head moves to (3,5), body segment 1, which was at (3,5), needs to move to the next position. But the next position for body segment 1 is the old position of segment 0, which is (3,4). So body segment 1 moves to (3,4). Then segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, which is (4,5)? Old positions: before move, head (3,4), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), etc.\n> \n> After move up: head to (3,5), then seg1 to old head position (3,4), seg2 to old seg1 position (3,5)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten. But in terms of positions, the body segments follow.\n> \n> Specifically: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is vacated. So the new positions are: head at new position, then each subsequent segment takes the position of the previous segment in the old list.\n> \n> So old positions: [ (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ]\n> \n> If move up to (3,5): new head at (3,5). Then the new body: first body segment at old head position (3,4), then next at old seg1 position (3,5)? No.\n> \n> The new segment 1 should be at the position where segment 0 was, which is (3,4). New segment 2 at position where segment 1 was, which is (3,5). But (3,5) is where the head just moved to, so that would be a collision because head and segment 2 are both at (3,5)? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to the new cell. If no food is eaten, the tail is removed, so the last segment is discarded. The body segments shift: the segment that was behind the head now occupies the head's old position, and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> For example, with positions [H, B1, B2, B3, T]\n> \n> After moving to a new cell without eating: new positions [new H, old H, B1, B2] and B3 is gone if it was the tail, but since tail moves, T is removed.\n> \n> In this case, positions: indices 0: H, 1: B1, 2: B2, 3: B3, ..., 10: T\n> \n> After moving head to a new position, say new_pos, the new positions are: [new_pos, old_pos of H, old_pos of B1, old_pos of B2, ..., old_pos of B9] and old T is removed. So the new snake has the same length, positions shifted.\n> \n> If food eaten, new segment added at the end, so positions: [new_pos, old H, old B1, ..., old T] and the tail is extended, so new segment at old T position? No, when food eaten, after moving, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving.\n> \n> But for collision, during movement, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail (because tail will move), it's a collision.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, head can move to tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> But for other body segments, if head moves there, it collides because that segment won't move away immediately.\n> \n> In this case, for move up from (3,4) to (3,5): (3,5) is currently occupied by B1, which is not the tail. Tail is at (3,2). So if I move to (3,5), it will collide with B1, since B1 is not moving away; it will stay or move to another position, but at the moment of movement, (3,5) has a body segment that isn't the tail, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to a cell with any body segment except the tail, it's deadly.\n> \n> Now, let's list possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up (U) to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied by snake body (segment 1), not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (3,3): is (3,3) free?

So (3,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but I need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (3,3) is within 1-6 in both x and y? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so playable grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> (3,3): x=3, y=3, both between 1 and 6, not a border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).

Snake positions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — (5,2) is segment 8 or so, not tail. Tail is (3,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is a body segment, and it has food on it? Food at (5,2) with value 1, life span 7.\n> \n> But the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,2), it has food, but currently occupied by body.

Move to new cell D with food eaten: new positions [D, A, B, C] and new segment added, so [D,A,B,C] with C still tail, but since new segment added, it should be [D,A,B,C] and a new cell at C? But C is occupied.\n> \n> Better: after moving, the positions are [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_bodyk, old_tail] and if food eaten, the old_tail position is kept, so the new segment is at old_tail position, but since the tail was there, it's extended.\n> \n> So in terms of cells: before move, cells occupied: H, B1, B2, ..., T.\n> \n> After move to new cell with food eaten: head at new, B1 at old H, B2 at old B1, ..., Bk at old Bk-1, T at old T position? Let's index.\n> \n> Positions before: seg0: H, seg1: B1, seg2: B2, ..., segN: T.\n> \n> After moving to new_pos with food eaten: new seg0: new_pos, new seg1: old seg0, new seg2: old seg1, ..., new segN: old segN-1, new segN+1: old segN (which is old tail position).\n> \n> So the new snake has segments from new_pos down to old tail position.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to (2,4) with food: new head at (2,4), new seg1 at (3,4), new seg2 at (3,5), new seg3 at (4,5), new seg4 at (5,5), new seg5 at (6,5), new seg6 at (6,4), new seg7 at (6,3), new seg8 at (6,2), new seg9 at (5,2), new seg10 at (4,2), new seg11 at (3,2). So tail at (3,2), but now it's seg11.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food, no new segment, tail moves off.\n> \n> But for now, back to decision.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,4), I eat the food, snake grows to 12 segments, head at (2,4), direction was D, but I moved L, so new direction L.\n> \n> Then from there, I can plan next moves.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Also, there is danger with tail food: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,2), and there is food at (5,2), which is on a body segment, not tail. But if later, when the tail moves, and if food is on tail cell, and head is adjacent, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> Currently, tail at (3,2), no food on it; food at (5,2) is on a body segment.\n> \n> For the food at (5,2), it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should eat food when possible, but avoid risks.\n> \n> (2,4) is right there, I can eat it now.\n> \n> But let's see the grid to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=6 to y=1, columns x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> y=6: top row, y=1 bottom, since y=0 is wall.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), y increases up or down?

It's turn 56, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning I can't move to cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,3), and the body segments follow: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is Down, which is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 4, value +1 (since it's positive food, I assume value is 1 unless specified, but it says value1=1 for the first one, so all seem +1)\n> \n> Food format: (x,y, life_span, value)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Food at (1,4): life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> - Food at (5,2): life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> - Food at (2,4): life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> All are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 56, life_span=4 for (1,4) means it will disappear after 4 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,4) with life_span=4 at turn 56, it will disappear at the end of turn 56 + 4 = turn 60? Or at the start of turn 60?\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 56, life_span=4; after turn 56, it becomes 3; after turn 57, it becomes 2; and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it disappears when life_span becomes 0 after the turn.\n> \n> But for eating, we care about when it's available. I need to plan moves to eat food before it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) has life_span=6, so it will last until turn 56+6-1=61? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life_span = N. After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1. After turn t+1, it becomes N-2, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So the food is present during the turn when life_span > 0.\n> \n> For (1,4) at turn 56: life_span=4, so it can be eaten on turns 56, 57, 58, 59. After turn 59, it disappears (life_span=0 at turn 60).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life_span=6 at turn 56: can be eaten from turn 56 to 61, disappears at turn 62.\n> \n> (2,4) life_span=9: can be eaten from 56 to 64, disappears at 65.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,3), direction Down. Down means moving to (x,y-1), so from (3,3), moving down would go to (3,2).\n> \n> But (3,2) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), etc. down to (4,2).\n> \n> List all snake positions:\n> \n> 1. (3,3) head\n> \n> 2. (3,4)\n> \n> 3. (3,5)\n> \n> 4. (4,5)\n> \n> 5.

(4,2) tail\n> \n> So the tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Now, food at (5,2) is mentioned, but (5,2) is occupied by the snake! It's the 10th segment.\n> \n> Food at (5,2) is listed, but snake has a segment at (5,2). How can food be there?\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,2), since it's under the snake body, I can only eat it if the snake moves such that the body is no longer there, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 56, (5,2) is occupied by snake, so I cannot eat it now. I need to move so that the tail moves away, but tail is at (4,2), so when the snake moves, the tail will move to the next position.\n> \n> Let's see the movement.\n> \n> Head direction is Down, so if I move down, head goes to (3,2), then the body follows: the segment that was at (3,4) moves to (3,3), (3,5) to (3,4), (4,5) to (3,5)? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves down to (3,2), then:\n> \n> - New head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Body: position 1 (was head) becomes (3,3), position 2 was (3,4) becomes (3,4)? Let's index.\n> \n> After move: new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2) if move down\n> \n> - Then segment 1: old head (3,3) becomes body\n> \n> - Segment 2: old (3,4) moves to (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old (3,5) moves to (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old (4,5) moves to (3,5)? No, (4,5) to where? The segments move to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> The snake positions list: index 0: head (3,3), index 1: (3,4), index 2: (3,5), index 3: (4,5), index 4: (5,5), index 5: (6,5), index 6: (6,4), index 7: (6,3), index 8: (6,2), index 9: (5,2), index 10: (4,2)\n> \n> After moving head down to (3,2):\n> \n> - New head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Then body: index 0 (old head) becomes (3,3)\n> \n> - Index 1 moves to old index 0 position: (3,3)? No.\n> \n> In snake movement, the head moves to a new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was. So:\n> \n> - New position 0: (3,2)  // head moved to (3,2)\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0, which is (3,3)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1, which is (3,4)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2, which is (3,5)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3, which is (4,5)\n> \n> - New position 5: old position 4, which is (5,5)\n> \n> - New position 6: old position 5, which is (6,5)\n> \n> - New position 7: old position 6, which is (6,4)\n> \n> - New position 8: old position 7, which is (6,3)\n> \n> - New position 9: old position 8, which is (6,2)\n> \n> - New position 10: old position 9, which is (5,2)\n> \n> - Old position 10 (4,2) is left, so tail moves away from (4,2).\n> \n> The tail was at (4,2), and after move, it's at (5,2) because old position 9 was (5,2), which is now new position 10.\n> \n> But (5,2) had food? Let's see.\n> \n> After move down, the cell (5,2) is now occupied by the tail segment, but food is at (5,2), so it's still under the body? Not necessarily, because the body moved.\n> \n> Before move, food at (5,2) is under snake body at position 9.\n> \n> After move down:\n> \n> - The head moves to (3,2)\n> \n> - The body segments shift: position 9 (was (5,2)) moves to where? New position 9 is old position 8, which is (6,2), and new position 10 is old position 9, which is (5,2). So (5,2) is still occupied by the snake, now at position 10 (tail).\n> \n> Position 10 was (4,2), which is now empty.\n> \n> Let's list new positions after move down:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)  // new\n> \n> - Pos1: old head (3,3)\n> \n> - Pos2: old pos1 (3,4)\n> \n> - Pos3: old pos2 (3,5)\n> \n> - Pos4: old pos3 (4,5)\n> \n> - Pos5: old pos4 (5,5)\n> \n> - Pos6: old pos5 (6,5)\n> \n> - Pos7: old pos6 (6,4)\n> \n> - Pos8: old pos7 (6,3)\n> \n> - Pos9: old pos8 (6,2)\n> \n> - Pos10: old pos9 (5,2)  // tail\n> \n> So (5,2) is still occupied by the tail, and food is at (5,2), so it's still under the body. To eat it, I need the snake to move so that (5,2) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, if I move down, (5,2) remains occupied.\n> \n> But the food at (5,2) has life_span=6, so it will be there for a while.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,4) and (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is at (2,4), which is not occupied by snake. Snake positions: all listed, no (2,4), so it's free.\n> \n> (1,4) also not occupied.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,3), direction Down.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is Down, I can move Down, Left, or Right, but not Up, because no instant reverse.

(2,3) is listed: internal obstacles include (2,3), so I cannot move to (2,3).

Usually in coordinates, y=0 might be bottom or top, but in movement, Down is y-1, so probably y increases up or down? Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases up, decreases down, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Or vice versa?\n> \n> In the state, head at (3,3), and moving down to (3,2), so if down is y-1, that means y decreases as we go down, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, walls at y=0 and y=7, so bottom and top borders.\n> \n> Now, snake head (3,3), which is somewhere in the middle.\n> \n> Food at (1,4), (5,2), (2,4)\n> \n> (1,4) is at x=1,y=4\n> \n> (5,2) at x=5,y=2\n> \n> (2,4) at x=2,y=4\n> \n> Head at (3,3)\n> \n> To eat (2,4), it's at (2,4), which is adjacent: from (3,3), (2,4) is left and up?

If I move left to (3,3), that would be colliding with body, since it's not the tail. The tail is (5,2), which is segment 10.\n> \n> Only moving to the current tail position is safe because after the move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> But (3,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment. So moving to (3,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,4) -- free, no obstacle, no snake body except possibly after move.\n> \n> - D: to (4,2) -- similarly, should be free.\n> \n> - R: to (5,3) -- obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (3,3) -- body segment, collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only U or D are possible moves for turn 57.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score, avoid risks, and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,4): value 1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 59? Life span decreases every turn including current. Turn 57: life span 3, so after turn 57, it decreases to 2, then turn 58 to 1, turn 59 to 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 57, 58, or 59.\n> \n> - (5,2): value 1, life span 5. Turn 57: life 5, decreases each turn, so eaten by turn 61? Turn 57:5, turn58:4, t59:3, t60:2, t61:1, t62:0. So eaten by turn 61.\n> \n> - (2,4): value 1, life span 8. Turn 57:8, so eaten by turn 64.\n> \n> (5,2) is at (5,2), which is currently occupied by the tail! Snake tail is at (5,2), and food is at (5,2).

The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food at (5,2), which is tail position.\n> \n> Head is at (4,3), which is adjacent to (5,2)? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,3) and (5,2): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent should be same x or same y, differ by 1.\n> \n> (4,3) to (5,3) would be adjacent horizontally, but (5,3) is wall.\n> \n> (4,3) to (4,2) down, (4,4) up, (3,3) left (invalid), (5,3) right (invalid).\n> \n> (5,2) is at x=5,y=2.

When snake moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten. Since I moved to (4,4), which has no food? (4,4) is not a food position, so no food eaten, so tail moves: the last segment is removed, so tail was (5,2), it is removed, new tail is (6,2)?

It's turn 58, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So these are cells the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). That's 11 segments. Head direction is down, so moving down, but since head is at (4,2), moving down would be to (4,1), but y=0 is a wall, so (4,1) is invalid? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So y=0 is a wall, meaning cells with y=0 are inaccessible. Similarly, x=0, x=7, y=7. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,2). Moving down from (4,2) would go to (4,1), but y=1 is the lowest, so (4,1) should be within bounds? y=1 to y=6, I think. y=0 is wall, so y=1 is accessible. Similarly, y=6 is accessible, y=7 wall.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction down. So if it moves down, to (4,1). But let's list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,3)  // since direction is down, and head at (4,2), body at (4,3) is above, so snake is moving down.\n> \n> Positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n> \n> From head (4,2) down to (4,3)? That doesn't make sense. If head is at (4,2) and moving down, the next segment should be where it came from. Direction is down, so it was moving down to (4,2), so the previous position is (4,3), which is above it? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, snake positions list head first, then the body segments in order. So [(4,2), (4,3), ...] means head at (4,2), then the next segment is (4,3), which is directly above since y increases up or down? In coordinates, usually y increases upwards, but in grids, sometimes y increases downwards. I need to clarify.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom or top? The wall is y=0 and y=7, with border cells. Probably, y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 top, but let's see the movement definitions.\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — so y increases upwards, I assume. D: (x, y-1) — y decreases downwards.\n> \n> So for head at (4,2), moving down (D) to (4,1). But (4,1) has y=1, which is above y=0? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is row 1, probably the bottom row if y=0 is below.\n> \n> Standard grid: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> For movement: U: (x,y+1) — so if y increases upwards, U is up. D: (x,y-1) down. L: (x-1,y) left. R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> Head at (4,2). Direction D, so it was moving down to (4,2). Before that, it was at (4,3), since moving down to (4,2) from (4,3).\n> \n> Positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), which is above it, then (3,3), which is left, then (3,4) up, (3,5) up, (4,5) right, (5,5) right, (6,5) right, (6,4) down, (6,3) down, (6,2) down? Let's plot this.\n> \n> List of positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (4,2) head\n> \n> Index 1: (4,3)  // directly above head\n> \n> Index 2: (3,3)  // left of (4,3)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,4)  // up from (3,3)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,5)  // up from (3,4)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,5)  // right from (3,5)\n> \n> Index 6: (5,5)  // right from (4,5)\n> \n> Index 7: (6,5)  // right from (5,5)\n> \n> Index 8: (6,4)  // down from (6,5)\n> \n> Index 9: (6,3)  // down from (6,4)\n> \n> Index 10: (6,2) // down from (6,3)\n> \n> Tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,2) with direction D, so it can move U, D, L, R, but not opposite direction instantly. Current direction is D, so it cannot move U immediately, because that would be reverse. No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so it cannot move U (up) on this turn. Possible moves: D, L, R. But D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1): x=4, y=1, which is within 1-6, so ok. (3,2): x=3,y=2 ok. (5,2): x=5,y=2 ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, but (5,2) is not an obstacle, so R to (5,2) is possible.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) not obstacle, L possible.\n> \n> (4,1) not obstacle, D possible.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,4) value 1, life_span 2\n> \n> - (5,2) value 1, life_span 4\n> \n> - (2,4) value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (6,2) value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? Value 1, and penalty for negative is -1, but here all value=1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Life span: (1,4) life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 58, life_span=2, so after this turn, if not eaten, it becomes life_span=1, then at turn 59, if not eaten, it becomes 0 and disappears? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,4) with life_span 2 on turn 58, after turn 58, if not eaten, life_span becomes 1. After turn 59, if not eaten, life_span becomes 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 58 or 59.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life_span 4, so disappears after 4 turns from now, so on turn 62 if not eaten.\n> \n> (2,4) life_span 7, disappears turn 65.\n> \n> (6,2) life_span 10, disappears turn 68.\n> \n> Now, special note: (6,2) has food, and it's also the tail position of the snake. Tail is at (6,2), and food is there.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,2), head is at (4,2). Are they adjacent? (4,2) to (6,2) is two cells apart in x, same y, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> From (4,2), adjacent cells: (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2). Tail is at (6,2), which is not adjacent; it's two steps right. So not adjacent to head now.\n> \n> But if snake moves, tail might move.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, possible actions this turn: since direction D, cannot go U. So can go D, L, R.\n> \n> Go D to (4,1)\n> \n> Go L to (3,2)\n> \n> Go R to (5,2)\n> \n> Now, (5,2) has food! (5,2) is a food position with value 1.\n> \n> If I go R to (5,2), I eat the food, since head moves there and it's food.\n> \n> Then snake grows: since positive food, length increases by one, so new head at (5,2), and tail stays or moves? When eating, head moves to food cell, and since it's eaten, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> Here: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So if I move to (5,2), I eat the food, head to (5,2), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (5,2), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, and so on, up to tail (6,2) still there, but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] but tail is (6,2), and I added a segment, so after move, snake has 12 segments: head at (5,2), then (4,2), then (4,3), ..., up to (6,3), and tail (6,2) but since I ate, the tail (6,2) doesn't move, so it stays, and a new segment is added at the tail? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move that turn, the new segment is attached, so the tail remains in place, and the body extends.\n> \n> Positions: before move, snake is at S0: (4,2), S1: (4,3), S2: (3,3), ..., S10: (6,2)\n> \n> After moving right to (5,2) and eating, new head at (5,2), then the previous head (4,2) becomes the first body segment, and so on, up to the tail (6,2) remains, but since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail position, so the tail stays at (6,2), and we have an additional segment.\n> \n> So the new positions: head: (5,2), then body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), and tail: (6,2) — but (6,2) was the tail, now it's the second last, and we add a new tail?

Turn 58 life=10, after turn 58 life=9, ..., after turn 67 life=0, so eaten turn 58 to 67.\n> \n> But (6,2) is current tail, so to eat it, tail must move away first.\n> \n> Current tail at (6,2), so when snake moves without eating, tail moves away, so (6,2) is free for head to move in later, but only if head goes there after tail leaves.\n> \n> Also, the food at (6,2) is on the tail, so once tail moves, it's exposed, and can be eaten.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail when eating, it kills snake.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a cell where tail is, but tail moves away, so when head moves to the food, tail is not there anymore, so no immediate collision, but after eating, the new tail is added, which might cause collision if head is near.\n> \n> Rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So it's about when eating the food that is on the tail cell, and if at that moment head is adjacent to tail, then after eating, since tail doesn't move, and head is on the food, but the new tail is added, which was the old tail position, so if head was adjacent, it might be next to the new tail, causing collision.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose tail is at T, with food. Head moves to T to eat the food. At the time of move, tail is at T, but when head moves to T, for that move, the tail is still at T, but during the move, when head moves to T, it eats the food, and tail does not move, so the new snake has head at T, and the old tail at T becomes part of body, and new tail is added at T? I'm confused.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, head moves to the food cell. If the food was under the tail, when the tail moves away, the food is exposed. Then, when head moves to that cell, it eats it. At that point, the tail has already moved, so the cell is empty except for food. Head moves there, eats, and since eating, tail does not move that turn, so the tail stays where it is, and a new segment is added at the end, so the snake grows.\n> \n> The position where the food was is now the new head, and the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the same as the old tail position before the move? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Assume at turn t, tail is at T with food. But since food is under tail, it can't be eaten yet.\n> \n> At turn t, snake moves, not eating anything, so tail moves away from T, to a new position, and T is now free, with food.\n> \n> Then at turn t+1, if head moves to T, it can eat the food.\n> \n> At that point, when head moves to T, it eats the food, so head is now at T, and the previous tail position (where tail was at turn t+1 before move) does not move, so it becomes the new tail, and we add no new segment? When eating, the tail does not move, so the segment that was the tail remains, and the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> For example, suppose before move at t+1, snake has head H, body, tail at P.\n> \n> Head moves to food cell F (which is T in this case), eats food, so new head at F.\n> \n> Then the body segments move: the first body segment goes to H's position, and so on, but the tail segment: since eating, the tail does not move, so it stays at P.\n> \n> Then, because we ate, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it's added at P, so the new tail is at P, and the old tail is now part of body.\n> \n> In terms of positions: let's say before move at t+1, positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]\n> \n> After moving head to F and eating:\n> \n> New head: F\n> \n> New segment 1: H (old head position)\n> \n> New segment 2: B1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment k+1: Bk\n> \n> New segment k+2: T  // old tail, now part of body\n> \n> New tail: T  // but T is occupied? No, new segment at the end is added.\n> \n> Since tail didn't move, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so the tail position remains, and it becomes the second last segment, and the new tail is the same cell? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a misconception.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the new cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one cell at the tail end, meaning the tail stays in place, and a new segment is attached there, but since it doesn't move, the position is the same, but it's now a body segment, and the new tail is that position? No.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the tail cell is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Common implementation: when snake eats, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail segment does not advance, so the last position is repeated, and the snake length increases by one. So the new tail is at the same position as the old tail.\n> \n> For example, positions before eat move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After eat: [F, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  but T is still there, so positions are F, then H, then B1, ..., up to T, and T is the tail, same as before.\n> \n> But in terms of cells, the cell T is occupied twice? No, in the list, the tail position is T, and it doesn't move, so it's still there.\n> \n> Then for the next move, it will move away if not eating.\n> \n> In this case, for the food at tail, when tail moves away, the cell is free with food. Head moves there, eats, and the tail position at that time stays, so if head was adjacent to tail before moving, it might be a problem.\n> \n> Tail Reward Danger rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, if you eat it, after eating, the head is on the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the new head is where the tail was, and the new tail is still there, so they are on the same cell, causing collision? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> After eating, the head is on the food cell, which was the tail cell, but the tail cell is now the head, and the body includes the previous tail position, but the new tail is the position that was the tail before eating, which is now a body segment.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> When you eat the food on the tail cell, you move the head to the tail cell. At that time, the tail is at that cell, so head and tail are on the same cell, which is a collision? But the rule says \"adjacent\", not same cell.\n> \n> \"adjacent to the tail\" means head is next to the tail cell, not on it.\n> \n> For example, head at H, tail at T, H and T are adjacent cells.\n> \n> T has food.\n> \n> If head moves to T to eat the food, but when it moves to T, T is occupied by the tail, so it's a collision? But the rule says food can be under body, and can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So when tail moves away, T is free, then head can move to T.\n> \n> At the time head moves to T, the tail is not at T anymore; it has moved.\n> \n> So head moves to T, eats food, and since eating, tail does not move that turn, so tail stays where it was before this move.\n> \n> Then, after eating, the new head is at T, and the tail is at its position, say P, and since eating, the snake grows, so the new tail is at P, and a new segment is added, but P is where the tail was.\n> \n> The collision danger is that if head was adjacent to tail before the move, after moving head to T (which was the food cell), the new head is at T, and the tail is at P, but if P is adjacent to T, then head and tail are adjacent, and since the snake grew, the new segment is added, but the tail didn't move, so the body includes the cells.\n> \n> After the move, the head is at T, the first body segment is at the previous head position, etc., and the tail is at P.\n> \n> If P is adjacent to T, then head at T and tail at P are adjacent, but in snake, head and tail can be adjacent without collision, as long as not on the same cell. Collision is when head hits body or wall.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment, including if it moves into a cell occupied by body.\n> \n> Tail is a body segment, but when it moves, it's ok to move to where tail was, because tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, after eating, head at T, tail at P, if P is adjacent to T, that's fine, no collision, because they are different cells.\n> \n> The rule says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" Newly grown tail?\n> \n> After eating, the tail is at P, and it is not grown; the growth is that the snake is longer.\n> \n> Perhaps the confusion is with \"newly grown tail\".\n> \n> Let's read: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> When you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the position P where the tail was becomes the second last segment, and a new tail segment is added at P, but that means two segments at P, which is impossible.\n> \n> I think there's a mistake in the rule interpretation.\n> \n> Perhaps \"newly grown tail\" means that after eating, the tail is extended, but in standard, the tail doesn't move, so the cell P is still occupied, and the new segment is added at P, but that would have two things at P.\n> \n> I think I have a fundamental error.\n> \n> Let me research standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> In most snake games, when the snake eats food, the head moves to the food position, and the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the last position is kept, and the snake length increases by one. So the new tail is at the same position as the old tail, and it doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> For example, positions: before eat, [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After moving head to F (food), and eating: new positions [F, H, B1, B2, T]  -- T is still there, so the tail is at T, and it's the same cell, but now it's part of the body, and the tail is still at T? No, in the list, T is the last element, so it's the tail.\n> \n> Then the positions are F, H, B1, B2, T, all distinct cells.\n> \n> T is the tail position.\n> \n> If F was T, but F is the food cell, which was free.\n> \n> In the case of tail food, when tail moves away, T is free with food. Head moves to T, so F = T.\n> \n> After eating, positions: new head at T, then old head H, then B1, B2, ..., and old tail position, say P, but P is where the tail was before move.\n> \n> Before move to eat, tail was at P, not at T.\n> \n> At turn t, tail moves away from T, so at turn t, after move, tail is at P, and T is free with food.\n> \n> At turn t+1, head moves to T to eat.\n> \n> Before move at t+1, head at H, tail at P.\n> \n> Head moves to T.\n> \n> Since eating, tail does not move, so new positions: head at T, then body: H, then the rest, and tail at P (does not move).\n> \n> So the new snake has head at T, and tail at P, with the body in between.\n> \n> No issue with collision, unless T is adjacent to P and the snake is short, but in general, it's ok.\n> \n> But the rule has \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifically: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills snake.\n> \n> In this case, when head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food, if you move head to the tail cell, but at that time, the tail cell is occupied by the tail, so moving there would be a collision with body, so you can't move there anyway.\n> \n> If the tail has moved away, the cell is free, so head can move there.\n> \n> But if head is adjacent to tail, and you move to the tail cell, but after tail moves, it's not there.\n> \n> Perhaps the danger is that after eating, the new head is at the former tail position, and if the tail was adjacent, now the new head is next to the current tail position, but since the tail didn't move, it might be close, but not necessarily collision.\n> \n> I think for this game, I should just follow the rule as stated.\n> \n> So if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, then eating that food (by moving to it) will kill the snake, because of collision with newly grown tail.\n> \n> To avoid that, I should not eat the food on the tail cell if head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> In this state, head at (4,2), tail at (6,2), not adjacent, so no danger for now.\n> \n> Also, (6,2) has food, so I can eat it later.\n> \n> Now, back to current turn.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D to (4,1): no food, so just move, tail moves to (6,3) or something.\n> \n> - L to (3,2): no food, move.\n> \n> - R to (5,2): has food, eat it, grow to 12 segments.\n> \n> If I go R, I eat (5,2) food, which is good, +1 score.\n> \n> Then new head at (5,2), direction R.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since I moved R, I cannot move L next turn.\n> \n> Current direction after move is R, so next turn cannot move L.\n> \n> Now, from (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (5,3): but (5,3) is an internal obstacle!

It's turn 59, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). That means these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,2), and the body segments follow: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). Head direction is R (right), meaning it was moving right to get to (5,2).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 1 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (6,2) is listed as food, but (6,2) is also part of the snake body? Snake positions end with (6,2), which is the tail. Let's see: snake is [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. So (6,2) is the tail segment.\n> \n> But food is at (6,2) with life span 9. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. Since (6,2) is the tail, and the head is at (5,2), which is adjacent.\n> \n> Head is at (5,2), tail is at (6,2). They are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Now, the rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, (6,2) has food, and head is at (5,2), which is adjacent. So if I move right to (6,2), I would eat the food, but since the head is adjacent to the tail, eating it would cause the snake to grow, so the new tail would be where the old tail was, but since the head moves to (6,2), and the tail was at (6,2), after moving, the tail moves away, but when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat food, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So if head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the new segment is added, so the tail stays in place.\n> \n> But in this case, if head moves to (6,2) which is currently the tail position and has food, then:\n> \n> - Before move: head at (5,2), tail at (6,2)\n> \n> - Move head to (6,2): since (6,2) has food, it is eaten. So the snake grows: the head is now at (6,2), and a new segment is added where the head was? No.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> 1. Head moves to new position.\n> \n> 2. If new position has food, eat it: don't remove the tail segment this turn, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> 3. If no food, remove the tail segment.\n> \n> So here: head moves from (5,2) to (6,2). (6,2) has food, so it is eaten. Therefore, the tail is not removed; instead, the snake grows, so the new length is one longer. The body segments follow: the old tail at (6,2) is no longer the tail; the new tail is the second last segment.\n> \n> But in this move, since head moves to (6,2) which was tail, and we eat, so:\n> \n> - New head position: (6,2)\n> \n> - Body: previous positions except tail is not removed. So the snake becomes: head at (6,2), then previous head (5,2) becomes segment, then (4,2), etc., and tail is still (6,2)? No.\n> \n> Let's list positions before move:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), ..., 11: tail (6,2)\n> \n> After move right:\n> \n> Head moves to (6,2). Since (6,2) has food, we don't remove the tail. So new positions: head at (6,2), then segments: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to the previous tail (6,2) is still there? But (6,2) is now the head, and also the previous tail was (6,2), but it's the same cell.\n> \n> Problem: the cell (6,2) was occupied by the tail. When head moves to it, it's moving to a cell that was occupied, but according to rules, body collision happens if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves away if no eat.\n> \n> But when eating, tail doesn't move, so if head moves to a cell that was tail and eats, then after move, the head is at the food cell, and the tail is still there? But that would mean two segments at (6,2), which is impossible.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake: the tail is only removed if no food is eaten. If food is eaten, the tail stays, so the snake grows.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the last segment (tail) is only removed if no eat.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Move head to new cell.\n> \n> - If new cell has food: add new head, and keep the tail; so the tail position remains, and a new segment is added at the head position.\n> \n> - If no food: add new head, remove tail; so tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to (6,2), which was the tail position:\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ]  // head at (5,2), tail at (6,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2):\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Since (6,2) has food, we do not remove the tail. So the body becomes: the previous head (5,2) is now segment 1, then (4,2) segment 2, ..., up to (6,3) segment 10, and the tail (6,2) is still there, but (6,2) is now the head, so the tail segment is removed? No.\n> \n> The list of positions: after move, the new head is at (6,2), and the body segments are all previous positions except that the tail is not removed, so the new body includes all previous positions, with the head moved.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: the snake moves forward; the head goes to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> - If new position has food, then after moving, the tail position is not removed, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> - If no food, the tail position is removed.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> New head position: (6,2)  // since moving right from (5,2)\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at index 1 (4,2) moves to where head was, (5,2)\n> \n> Segment at index 2 (4,3) moves to where index 1 was, (4,2)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment at index 11 (6,2) moves to where index 10 was, (6,3)? Index 10 is (6,3), so tail (index 11) moves to (6,3)\n> \n> Let's index the positions:\n> \n> 0: (5,2) head\n> \n> 1: (4,2)\n> \n> 2: (4,3)\n> \n> 3: (3,3)\n> \n> 4: (3,4)\n> \n> 5: (3,5)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (6,5)\n> \n> 9: (6,4)\n> \n> 10: (6,3)\n> \n> 11: (6,2) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2):\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 0 moves to new head position, but segment 0 was head, now it's body.\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> Head is now at (6,2)\n> \n> Then, the body segments: the previous positions shifted.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 0 (5,2) is now at position where head was, but head moved, so index 1 moves to index 0's position, etc.\n> \n> Standard way: after move, the new position list is:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment is the previous head position (5,2)\n> \n> - Then the previous segment 1 position (4,2)\n> \n> - Then previous segment 2 (4,3)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Up to previous segment 10 (6,3)\n> \n> - And since we ate food, we do not remove the tail, so the previous tail (6,2) is not in the list? No.\n> \n> Because the tail moves: the last segment moves to where the second last was.\n> \n> In this case, when we move, the tail segment (index 11) moves to where index 10 was, which is (6,3).\n> \n> Then, since we ate food, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was or something? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let me clarify with a smaller example.\n> \n> Suppose snake: head at A, body at B, tail at C. Positions: [A, B, C]\n> \n> Move head to D.\n> \n> If D has no food: new positions [D, A, B]  // C is removed\n> \n> If D has food: new positions [D, A, B, C]  // C is not removed, so snake grows, and C is still tail.\n> \n> In this case, D is the new head, A is new body, B is body, C is tail.\n> \n> If D is the same as C, but in grid, positions are cells.\n> \n> In this state, if head moves to (6,2), which is the current tail position.\n> \n> Before: positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., (6,3), (6,2) ]  // (6,2) is tail\n> \n> Move head to (6,2): new head at (6,2)\n> \n> Since (6,2) has food, we do not remove the tail. So the new positions should be: new head (6,2), then previous head (5,2), then previous segment 1 (4,2), ..., previous segment 10 (6,3), and previous tail (6,2) is not removed, so it should be added, but (6,2) is already the head, so we have two segments at (6,2)? That's a problem.\n> \n> I think there's a mistake. When the head moves to a cell that was the tail, and it has food, it's a special case.\n> \n> According to the rule given: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For the tail, if the food is under the tail, and the tail moves away, then the head can move onto it.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is at (6,2), which is the tail, so for it to be eaten, the tail must move away first, then the head moves to it later.\n> \n> But if the head moves to it directly, since the tail is still there, it might cause collision.\n> \n> The rule specifically says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So in this case, head at (5,2), tail at (6,2), adjacent. Food at (6,2). If I move right to (6,2), I eat the food, but because the head was adjacent to the tail, after eating, the snake grows, so the new tail will be where the old tail was, but the head is now there, so it collides with itself.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> Before move: head (5,2), tail (6,2)\n> \n> Move head to (6,2): eats food, so snake grows. New positions: head at (6,2), body segments: (5,2), then (4,2), (4,3), ..., (6,3), and since we ate, we add a new segment, but where? The new segment is added at the tail position before move, which is (6,2), but (6,2) is now the head, so we have head at (6,2) and a new segment at (6,2), which is impossible; or the new segment is added after the tail.\n> \n> I think the common implementation is that when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake length increases by one, with the head at the new position, and the tail remains where it was.\n> \n> So in this case:\n> \n> After move: head at (6,2)  // new position\n> \n> Body: the previous positions from head to tail are kept, so (5,2) becomes body, (4,2) body, ..., (6,2) was tail, but now it's not tail anymore, the new tail is the previous second last segment or something.\n> \n> Positions before: 0:(5,2), 1:(4,2), 2:(4,3), 3:(3,3), 4:(3,4), 5:(3,5), 6:(4,5), 7:(5,5), 8:(6,5), 9:(6,4), 10:(6,3), 11:(6,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head at (6,2)\n> \n> - Then the previous segments from 0 to 10 are all kept, but shifted: new segment 0: (6,2) head\n> \n> New segment 1: previous seg0 (5,2)\n> \n> New segment 2: previous seg1 (4,2)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 11: previous seg10 (6,3)\n> \n> And since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, which is the position of the previous tail (6,2), but (6,2) is now the head, so new segment 12 at (6,2)? That would have two at (6,2), which is collision.\n> \n> Therefore, it's not allowed; the snake would die because of collision with itself at (6,2).\n> \n> The rule says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\", so in this case, after eating, the head is at (6,2), and the new tail is added at (6,2), but since it's the same cell, it collides.\n> \n> So for safety, we should not move to the tail if it has food and we are adjacent.\n> \n> In this state, moving right to (6,2) would cause death.\n> \n> So I must avoid that.\n> \n> Now, back to the food: (6,2) has life span 9, so it will be there for a while, but I can't eat it now because of the danger.\n> \n> Other foods: (1,4) with life span 1, so it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 59, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> (2,4) with life span 6, so it has 6 turns left, including turn 59.\n> \n> (6,2) with life span 9.\n> \n> Head at (5,2), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

So I can't eat it this turn, so it will disappear after this turn. So (1,4) is not available.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 59: it will disappear after turn 59, meaning if not eaten on turn 59, it's gone.

It's turn 60, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so that's from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles are at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I should plot this mentally.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is Down, which means it was moving down to (5,1) from (5,2)? Let's see the positions: the list is head first, so from head to tail: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), etc. Head is at (5,1), and it's moving Down. If head is at (5,1) and direction is Down, that means it just moved to (5,1) from above, but (5,1) is the head, so before moving, head was at (5,2) I think? I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> The head direction is given as \"D\" for Down. Since the snake moves one cell per turn, and head direction indicates the direction it moved to get to the current position. So from turn 59 to turn 60, the snake moved Down to (5,1), so it was at (5,2) on turn 59, and now at (5,1) on turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: (2,4) disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so it will be gone by turn 66. Similarly, (6,2) disappears after 8 turns, by turn 68.\n> \n> Current turn is 60, so for (2,4): life span 6, so it will count down each turn, starting from turn 60. So it exists on turns 60,61,62,63,64,65. Gone on turn 66.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): exists on turns 60 to 67, gone on turn 68.\n> \n> I need to move the snake to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Snake occupies: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Food at: (2,4) and (6,2)\n> \n> (2,4) is food, but let's see if it's under the snake. Snake positions: (3,4) is a body segment, but (2,4) is not listed in snake positions, so it's free. Similarly, (6,2) is not in snake positions.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,1), moving Down. But moving Down to (5,1) means from above, so possible moves from here.\n> \n> Since head direction is Down, I cannot move Up immediately because of no instant reverse rule. So from (5,1), with head direction Down, I can move Down, Left, or Right? Directions: U (y+1), D (y-1), L (x-1), R (x+1). Assuming y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y+1 is Up, meaning y increases as we go up, I think.\n> \n> In standard coordinates, often y=0 is bottom, but here U is (x,y+1), so moving up increases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (5,1): x=5, y=1. Since head direction is Down, and Down is (x,y-1), so from (5,2) to (5,1), y decreased from 2 to 1.\n> \n> Now, from current position (5,1), with last move Down, I can move:\n> \n> - Down: to (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Left: to (4,1)\n> \n> - Right: to (6,1)\n> \n> - Up: to (5,2), but (5,2) is the second segment, and moving Up would be reverse, which is not allowed because last move was Down, so Up is opposite, cannot move Up.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is Down, so cannot move Up on next turn.\n> \n> So possible moves: Left to (4,1) or Right to (6,1). Down to (5,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> (4,1): is it free?

Obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). (6,1) is none, so free.\n> \n> But (6,2) is food, but we're at (5,1), so moving to (6,1) is adjacent, but not directly to food.\n> \n> I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells to avoid.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

So after eating, the snake will have head at (6,2), and the body includes (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), etc., and tail at (6,3) still? Let's simulate.\n> \n> On turn 60: head at (5,1), move R to (6,1). Now snake positions: head to (6,1), then previous head (5,1) becomes body, so new positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (6,3)] but (5,1) was head, now body, and (5,2) was first body, still there. The tail (6,3) moves? No, when snake moves, all segments shift: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when you move, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated, unless you eat food, then tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> In this case, if I don't eat food, after move, tail is removed.\n> \n> But when I move to a food, I eat it, so no tail removal, length increases.\n> \n> But for collision, during move, if head hits body or wall, it dies.\n> \n> Now, from (5,1) to (6,1): (6,1) is not wall, not occupied by body? Body cells are (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), etc. (6,1) is not in the list, so it should be safe.\n> \n> Then, from (6,1), I can move to (6,2), which is food. (6,2) is not occupied by body currently? Current body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). (6,2) is not in this list, and it's food, so moving to (6,2) should eat it.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), head is there, and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No: when you eat, the head moves to food, the body follows, but the tail stays in place, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> Positions after eating: head at (6,2), then the previous head (6,1) becomes first body, then (5,1), (5,2), and so on, up to (6,3) which is still tail, but since we ate, tail doesn't advance, so (6,3) remains, and we have a new segment at the end? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), ..., (6,3) ] 12 segments.\n> \n> Move head to (6,1): no eat, so new positions: head to (6,1), then body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), ..., and tail (6,3) moves to the previous position of the second last, which is (6,4)? The segment before tail is (6,4), so when head moves to (6,1), the body shifts: (5,1) moves to where (5,1) was but it's now occupied? Standard: the head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving to (6,1) without eating: new head at (6,1), then the first body segment is at previous head position (5,1), second body at previous first body (5,2), third at (4,2), and so on, up to the tail, which was at (6,3), but since we didn't eat, the last segment is removed, so the segment that was at (6,4) moves to (6,3)? Let's index.\n> \n> Let positions be P0 = head (5,1), P1 = (5,2), P2 = (4,2), P3 = (4,3), P4 = (3,3), P5 = (3,4), P6 = (3,5), P7 = (4,5), P8 = (5,5), P9 = (6,5), P10 = (6,4), P11 = tail (6,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,1): new head at (6,1), then new P1 = old P0 = (5,1), new P2 = old P1 = (5,2), new P3 = old P2 = (4,2), ..., new P10 = old P9 = (6,5)? Old P9 is (6,5), old P10 is (6,4), old P11 is (6,3).\n> \n> After move: new head at (6,1), then new body: position 1: old head (5,1), position 2: old P1 (5,2), position 3: old P2 (4,2), ..., position 10: old P9 (6,5), position 11: old P10 (6,4). And since no eat, the tail old P11 (6,3) is removed, so 11 segments now.\n> \n> Old P11 is (6,3), which is removed, so new positions: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — 12 positions? No: from above, new head (6,1), new P1 (5,1), new P2 (5,2), new P3 (4,2), new P4 (4,3), new P5 (3,3), new P6 (3,4), new P7 (3,5), new P8 (4,5), new P9 (5,5), new P10 (6,5), new P11 (6,4) — but old P10 was (6,4), which becomes new P11, and old P11 (6,3) is gone. So new tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Now, if I then move to (6,2) from (6,1), (6,2) is food, so I eat it. When I move to food, head goes to (6,2), and the body shifts, but tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2) and eating: new head at (6,2), new P1 = previous head (6,1), new P2 = previous P1 (5,1), and so on, up to new P11 = previous P10 (6,5), and since ate, we add a new segment at previous tail position, which was (6,4) before the move? Before the move to (6,2), the snake was at positions: let's call S: head (6,1), P1 (5,1), P2 (5,2), P3 (4,2), P4 (4,3), P5 (3,3), P6 (3,4), P7 (3,5), P8 (4,5), P9 (5,5), P10 (6,5), P11 (6,4) — tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Move head to (6,2) and eat food: new head at (6,2), new P1 = old head (6,1), new P2 = old P1 (5,1), new P3 = old P2 (5,2), ..., new P11 = old P10 (6,5), and since ate, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before move, which is (6,4), so new P12 = (6,4). But (6,4) is where old P11 was, so it stays, and we have 13 segments.\n> \n> The key point is that (6,2) is not occupied when I move there, so it should be safe to eat.\n> \n> But there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (6,4), food is at (6,2), which is not the tail cell. Tail cell is (6,4), no food there. So no issue.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, but no immediate danger.\n> \n> But let's see the position: head at (6,2), tail at (6,4)? After eating, positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — and new tail at (6,4)? New P12 is (6,4), but (6,4) is already there? Let's list: new segments: head (6,2), P1 (6,1), P2 (5,1), P3 (5,2), P4 (4,2), P5 (4,3), P6 (3,3), P7 (3,4), P8 (3,5), P9 (4,5), P10 (5,5), P11 (6,5), P12 (6,4) — so tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Now, head at (6,2), which is above (6,1), so direction could be U.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> There's another food at (2,4) with shorter life span.\n> \n> If I go left to (4,1), then I can go towards (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is at x=2,y=4.\n> \n> From (5,1), move L to (4,1).\n> \n> Then from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2), but (4,2) is currently a body segment? Current positions: (4,2) is occupied, but when I move, it might be free.\n> \n> On turn 60, move L to (4,1): (4,1) is free, move there.\n> \n> New positions: head to (4,1), then body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., and tail (6,3) removed? After move to (4,1) no eat: new head (4,1), P1 (5,1), P2 (5,2), P3 (4,2), P4 (4,3), P5 (3,3), P6 (3,4), P7 (3,5), P8 (4,5), P9 (5,5), P10 (6,5), P11 (6,4) — tail at (6,4).\n> \n> (4,2) is now P3, which is body, but when I am at (4,1), I can move to (4,2)? (4,2) is currently occupied by P3, so moving there would be collision, unless it moves away.\n> \n> But when I move, the body shifts. From (4,1), I can move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall invalid, L to (3,1), R to (5,1) but (5,1) is now body P1, so cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> (4,1) to (4,2): (4,2) is currently P3, but when I move to (4,2), at that time, the body will have shifted.\n> \n> At the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail and it moves away, but only for food under body, but here (4,2) is not food, it's body.\n> \n> General rule: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment at that time, it collides and dies.\n> \n> Before move, (4,2) is occupied by P3. When I move head to (4,2), at the same time, the body segments move. So the cell (4,2) might be vacated by the body segment moving away.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment simultaneously.\n> \n> So for cell (4,2), before move, it is occupied by P3 (which was (4,2) in old positions).\n> \n> After head moves to (4,2), the new head is at (4,2), then new P1 is at old head (4,1), new P2 is at old P1 (5,1), new P3 is at old P2 (5,2), and so on. So the old P3 at (4,2) moves to new P3 position, which is old P2 (5,2). So (4,2) is vacated by the body and occupied by the new head. Since the head moves to it after the body leaves, it should be ok, as long as no other collision.\n> \n> In snake games, moving to the cell that was just vacated by the adjacent body segment is allowed because that segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if head is at A, body at B, and you move head to B, at the same time body moves to where the next was, but since the body at B moves away, and head moves to B, it doesn't collide because the cell is free for that instant? I think in standard rules, it is allowed to move to the position that the neck was, because the neck moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,1), moving to (4,2) which was the position of the first body segment.\n> \n> After move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), P1 (5,1), P2 (5,2), P3 (4,2), etc.\n> \n> P3 is at (4,2), which is directly above (4,1).\n> \n> If I move Up to (4,2), head moves to (4,2), and simultaneously, the body segment at (4,2) (P3) moves to the position of P2, which is (5,2), so (4,2) is now free for head to occupy. No collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I were to move to the tail position and tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> Only if I move to a body segment that doesn't move away, like if it's not the immediate next, then collision.\n> \n> But here, since (4,2) is the adjacent body cell, moving there should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, I can move Left to (3,1) or Right to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied by P1, so moving to (5,1) would be collision because P1 is there and it will move, but to where? If I move to (5,1), head at (4,1), P1 at (5,1), which is adjacent right. Moving to (5,1): head moves to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied by P1, and P1 will move to where? New P1 should be at old head position (4,1), so P1 moves to (4,1), but at the same time, head moves to (5,1). Since P1 is moving to (4,1), it vacates (5,1), so head can move to (5,1) safely. But (5,1) is being vacated by P1, so yes, it should be ok.\n> \n> In general, the only body cell you can move to is the tail cell if it moves away, but for other cells, if you move to a body cell, it might not be vacated.\n> \n> For example, if a body segment is not moving away from its position, then moving there causes collision.\n> \n> But in this case, for a body segment, when the snake moves, each segment moves to a new position, so the cell it was in is vacated, and if head moves to that cell, it should be fine as long as no other issue.\n> \n> The collision rule: head touches any body segment after the move. After moving, if the head is on the same cell as any body segment, it dies.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, and the body moves, the new positions are set, and if head position equals any body position, collision.\n> \n> For moving to (4,2) from (4,1): after move, new head at (4,2), new body: P1 at (4,1) (previous head), P2 at (5,1) (previous P1), P3 at (5,2) (previous P2), etc. So (4,2) is head, not body, and no body is at (4,2), so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,1) from (4,1): new head at (5,1), new P1 at (4,1), new P2 at (5,2), etc. (5,1) is head, not body, so safe.\n> \n> But (5,1) was previously body, but after move, it's head, and the body is at new positions.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,2): should be safe, as above\n> \n> - D to (4,0): wall, invalid\n> \n> - L to (3,1): let's check (3,1). Is it free? Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,1) is obstacle, (3,1) is not listed, so should be free. Snake positions after move to (4,1): body at (5,1), (5,2), etc., not (3,1), so free.\n> \n> - R to (5,1): but (5,1) is where P1 is, but after move, as above, it should be safe to move there, since P1 moves to (4,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is occupied by P1 before move, but when I move, P1 moves to new position, so (5,1) is vacated, and head can move there.\n> \n> Similarly, I can move to (3,1) or (4,2) or (5,1).\n> \n> But (4,2) is where the body was, but it moves away.\n> \n> So from (4,1), moves: U, L, R are possible, D invalid.\n> \n> Back to the decision.\n> \n> I have two choices at turn 60: L or R.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,1), then next turn I can go U to (6,2) to eat the food there.\n> \n> (6,2) has life span 8, so not urgent.\n> \n> There is food at (2,4) with life span 6, so only 5 more turns to eat it?

It's turn 61, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include borders and internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,1), then body segments: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (2,4) with life span 5, value +1 (positive food)\n> - (6,2) with life span 7, value +1 (positive food)\n> - (1,2) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n> \n> Current turn is 61, so:\n> - Food at (2,4): life span 5, so it disappears after turn 65? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N-1 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear at turn T + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn T, countdown is L, after one turn, it's L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So it disappears at the start of turn when countdown reaches 0? The rule doesn't specify exactly when it disappears, but since it can be eaten on the turn when countdown is still >0, I think it disappears at the end of the turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> But for simplicity, I'll assume that at turn T, with life span L, the food can be eaten on turns T to T+L-1, and disappears at turn T+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 61, life span 5: it can be eaten on turns 61,62,63,64, and disappears at turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 7: can be eaten turns 61 to 67, disappears turn 68.\n> \n> (1,2) life span 10: eaten turns 61 to 70, disappears turn 71.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,1) moving right. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next turn.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, except tail is ok if it moves away.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.

But the body will move away when the snake moves, so it might be ok? Let's see collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

After the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So if head moves to (5,1), which is currently occupied by segment 1. After move, segment 1 will move to where segment 2 is, or something? Let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn start: positions: H(6,1), B1(5,1), B2(5,2), B3(4,2), ..., up to tail T(6,4)\n> \n> If I move left to (5,1), new head position (5,1). Then the body segments: B1 moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment is added if food eaten.\n> \n> But for collision, during the move, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail (which will move), it collides.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that has a body segment causes collision, except if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) is B1, not the tail. Tail is (6,4). So moving to (5,1) would collide with body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving up to (6,2): what is at (6,2)? Let's see snake positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), etc. (6,2) is not in the list, so it might be free or have food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is present, with value +1.\n> \n> (6,2) is a food position, so it should be empty for snake body? Snake body positions are given, so (6,2) is not occupied by snake, so it should be free or food.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (6,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving right to (7,1) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (6,1) are: U to (6,2) or L to (5,1). But L to (5,1) is occupied by B1, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Let me confirm snake positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> So cells occupied: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,2) is not in this list, so it should be empty or food. And indeed, food is at (6,2), so it's a food cell.\n> \n> Also, no wall at (6,2), walls are borders and internal, (6,2) is not border or internal obstacle? Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,2) is within, and internal obstacles don't include (6,2), so it's free but with food.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,1), moving U to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> L to (5,1) is occupied by snake body (segment 1), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> D and R are walls, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible action at turn 61 is U to (6,2).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> So for turn 61, I must move U.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (6,2), I eat the food there? Since (6,2) has food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) with value +1, life span 7.\n> \n> So if I move to (6,2), I eat the food, snake grows, so length increases by 1, new tail added.\n> \n> After eating, the snake will have 13 segments.\n> \n> New head position: (6,2)\n> \n> Then body: since I ate food, a new segment is added where the tail was, but tail moves only if no food eaten?

No.\n> \n> The movement: head moves to new cell. If food eaten, the tail remains, so a new segment is added.

It's turn 63, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but moving to any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Similarly, internal obstacles are given: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]. So I need to avoid these as well.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). That's 13 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards (x,y+1). Since head is at (6,3), moving up would go to (6,4).\n> \n> Food positions: one at (2,4) with value 1 and life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 63, life span 3, so it will be gone by turn 66. Similarly, food at (1,2) with value 1 and life span 8, so it will last until turn 71.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value 1, so eating them increases length by 1.

No.\n> \n> List: after move to (5,5), head is (5,5), then the previous positions are all kept, but since growth, tail doesn't move, so the new body includes all previous segments plus the new head, so positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] so tail is (4,5), and the segment before that is (3,5).\n> \n> Now, direction: head moved from (6,5) to (5,5), which is left, so new direction is L.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,6), no food there, so snake moves, head to (6,6), tail moves forward. So new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and tail is (4,5) but tail moves to (3,5)? After move, head to (6,6), then the body: previous head (6,5) becomes first body, then (6,4), ..., up to (3,5), and the tail (4,5) is removed? When no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions before move: indices 0: (6,5) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (5,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (3,4), 11: (3,5), 12: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (6,6), no eat, so new head (6,6), then body: segment 0 moves to (6,6), so segment 1 (which was (6,4)) moves to where segment 0 was, (6,5), segment 2 moves to (6,4), ..., segment 12 moves to where segment 11 was, which is (3,5), and the tail segment 12 (4,5) is removed, so new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) and tail is (3,5)? Let's list: new body: position of new head is (6,6), then the previous positions from index 0 to 11 become the new body segments 1 to 12? Better: the new body is: the cell that was head becomes first body, then the previous body segments in order, but the last one is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head: (6,6), body segments: (6,5) [previous head], (6,4) [previous seg1], (6,3) [seg2], (6,2) [seg3], (6,1) [seg4], (5,1) [seg5], (5,2) [seg6], (4,2) [seg7], (4,3) [seg8], (3,3) [seg9], (3,4) [seg10], (3,5) [seg11], and the tail was seg12 (4,5), but since no growth, it is removed, so the last body is (3,5), which was seg11, now tail.\n> \n> Seg11 was (3,5), and after move, it becomes the last segment, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Direction: moved U, so new direction U.\n> \n> Now, need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, option 1: move L to (5,5) on turn 65, eat food.\n> \n> Then new state: head at (5,5), dir L, positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Food: (2,4) disappears after this turn since not eaten, life span 1.\n> \n> (1,2) still there, life span 5 at turn 66?

No, food is at (1,2), not (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is empty cell now? After we moved to (5,5), (4,5) is still occupied by the tail, but when we move, if we go to (4,5), it's the tail position.\n> \n> If I move to (4,5), since it's the current tail, and if I don't eat food, tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> But (4,5) has no food, so moving to (4,5) is safe, but no food.\n> \n> Other cells: down to (5,4): what is (5,4)?

Let me list them in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (5,5)\n> \n> 2. (6,5)\n> \n> 3. (6,4)\n> \n> 4. (6,3)\n> \n> 5. (6,2)\n> \n> 6. (6,1)\n> \n> 7. (5,1)\n> \n> 8. (5,2)\n> \n> 9. (4,2)\n> \n> 10. (4,3)\n> \n> 11. (3,3)\n> \n> 12. (3,4)\n> \n> 13. (3,5)\n> \n> 14. (4,5)  # This is the tail, I assume, since it's last.\n> \n> The positions are given as a list: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]. So the snake has 14 segments. Head at (5,5), tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which means Left. So it was moving left to (5,5) from previous position. Since it came to (5,5) from the right, because (6,5) is to the right of (5,5), so direction L makes sense; it moved left to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, food: only one food item given: (1,2) with value 1 and life span 6. So positive food at (1,2), which will disappear after 6 turns, including this turn, so it has 5 more turns after this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 66, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 66 + 5 = 71? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will be there for this turn and N-1 more turns? For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on this turn. If N=2, it can be eaten on this turn or next, and disappears after next turn.\n> \n> Here, at turn 66, food at (1,2) has life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 66 to 71, and disappears after turn 71? Turn 66: life span 6, after turn 66, it becomes 5, and so on, down to 0 after turn 71? Let's think:\n> \n> - Turn 66: life span 6, available\n> \n> - Turn 67: life span 5, available\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 71: life span 1, available\n> \n> - Turn 72: life span 0, disappears, not available.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn 66 to 71 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The action sequence should be for turns starting from t1=66.\n> \n> First, I need to find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head at (5,5), direction L. So possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1,y), R (right, x+1,y). But no instant reverse, so since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on this turn because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current direction L means I was moving left to (5,5), so from (6,5) to (5,5). Now, from (5,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,6)\n> \n> - D: (5,4)\n> \n> - L: (4,5)  # left, x-1\n> \n> - R: (6,5) but R is right, which is opposite to L, so cannot move R because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but body collision: moving to a cell that will be occupied by body when head moves, except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that won't move away, it's collision. But the tail segment will move if the snake doesn't eat, so if head moves to tail position, it's ok because tail moves forward.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving, the new head position, if it's the same as the current tail position, it's ok because tail will move to next position. If it's any other body segment, it will still be there, so collision.\n> \n> Also, walls: border walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to 6 inclusive, that's 6 cells? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are free? Similarly y.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are valid, that's 6 columns. Similarly y=1 to 6.\n> \n> But internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (3,6): y=6, but y=6 is not border? Border y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable, but (3,6) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): y=1, playable but obstacle.\n> \n> (1,3), (2,3), etc.\n> \n> Also, (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Now, current head at (5,5).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,6). Is this valid? (5,6): check if wall or obstacle. y=6 is not border wall, but (5,6) is an internal obstacle? Look at internal obstacles: (5,6) is listed, yes, so (5,6) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are walls, so cells occupied by walls.\n> \n> - D: to (5,4). (5,4) is an internal obstacle? List: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are obstacles. (5,4) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - L: to (4,5). (4,5) is not listed as wall, and not border, so should be free? But is it occupied by snake body?\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all snake positions to see where body is.\n> \n> Snake: (5,5) head, then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (4,5) is the last position, which is the tail.\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is occupied by tail. If head moves to (4,5), since it's the tail, and we don't eat food, tail will move away, so it should be ok, no collision.\n> \n> - R: to (6,5). But (6,5) is the first body segment after head. Currently, (6,5) is occupied by the snake body. If head moves to (6,5), it would be colliding with itself because (6,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment. After head moves, the body segments follow, so (6,5) would still be occupied unless it's the tail, which it's not.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's a collision. If it's the current tail, and we don't eat, tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> Here, (6,5) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is (4,5).\n> \n> So moving to (6,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Also, R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R anyway due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5):\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (5,4) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: (4,5) - currently occupied by tail, but can move there since tail will move\n> \n> - R: (6,5) - occupied by body, and opposite direction, invalid\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (4,5).\n> \n> Is that right? U and D are walls, R is invalid, so only L is possible.\n> \n> But let me confirm the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7; internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,6) is wall, (5,4) is wall, (5,3) is wall.\n> \n> (5,5) is free, head.\n> \n> (4,5): not in wall list, not border, so free, but occupied by snake tail.\n> \n> Since it's tail, moving there is ok.\n> \n> Are there any other directions? I think only L is possible.\n> \n> But what about other cells? For example, could I move to (4,6) or something? No, only adjacent: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> So from (5,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,6) - wall\n> \n> - Down: (5,4) - wall\n> \n> - Left: (4,5) - free, occupied by tail, but movable\n> \n> - Right: (6,5) - occupied by body, not movable\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is L to (4,5).\n> \n> Therefore, on turn 66, I must move L to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,5), what happens? The head moves to (4,5), which was the tail. Since we didn't eat food (no food at (4,5)? Food is at (1,2), not here), so the snake does not grow, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,5), which head is moving to, so after head moves to (4,5), the tail will be removed, and new positions: head at (4,5), then the body: the previous segments except tail.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), ..., up to tail (4,5).\n> \n> After moving L to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head at (4,5)\n> \n> - Then the body: first segment after head was (6,5), but now it becomes the new second segment, and so on, up to the second last segment (3,5) or what?\n> \n> List of positions before move: index 0: (5,5) head, 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (5,2), 8: (4,2), 9: (4,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (3,4), 12: (3,5), 13: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5), which was the tail position, and since no food eaten, we remove the tail, so new snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,5)\n> \n> Then: (5,5)  # previous head\n> \n> Then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)  # and (4,5) was tail, removed.\n> \n> (3,5) was position 12, which is now the last segment, tail.\n> \n> So new positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Head direction: after moving left to (4,5), the new direction is L (left).\n> \n> Now, it's turn 67? Turn 66: move to (4,5), so now state for turn 67.\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> But currently, only one food at (1,2), value 1, life span 6 at turn 66, so at turn 67, life span decreases to 5, still available.\n> \n> Now, I need to get to (1,2) to eat the food, but it's at (1,2), and I'm at (4,5), so I need to move left and down.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls at borders and internals.\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\n> \n> Now, snake positions after turn 66: head at (4,5), body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) with value 1, life span now 5 (since turn 67).\n> \n> I need to go to (1,2). (1,2) is at x=1,y=2.\n> \n> Is (1,2) accessible? Not a wall, so yes.\n> \n> Path from (4,5) to (1,2): need to move left (decrease x) and down (decrease y).\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> For example, directly left: to (3,5), (2,5), etc., but (2,5) might be free? Let's see free cells.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is around, so I need to avoid colliding.\n> \n> Moreover, tail is at (3,5), which is adjacent to head? Head at (4,5), tail at (3,5), which is left of head, so if I move left to (3,5), it would be moving to tail position.\n> \n> At turn 67, head at (4,5), direction L (since last move left).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - U: to (4,6). Is (4,6) wall? Internal obstacles: (3,6) is wall, but (4,6) not listed, so should be free? Border y=7 wall, y=6 not border, so (4,6) is playable and no obstacle listed, so free.\n> \n> But is it occupied? Snake positions: after move, positions are (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), etc., no (4,6), so free.\n> \n> - D: to (4,4). (4,4) not wall, not occupied? Snake has (4,3), but (4,4) not in positions, so free.\n> \n> - L: to (3,5). (3,5) is currently the tail position. So if move to (3,5), since it's tail, and no food, it should be ok.\n> \n> - R: to (5,5). (5,5) is occupied by the second segment, so collision. Also, R is opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, moving R would be opposite, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> No instant reverse: from direction L, cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> L to (3,5) is possible since it's tail.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead to eat the food at (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is at x=1,y=2.\n> \n> From (4,5) to (1,2), I need to decrease x by 3 and decrease y by 3.\n> \n> But with obstacles, I need a path.\n> \n> Also, the food life span: at turn 67, life span 5, so must eat by turn 71.\n> \n> Turn now 67?

Turn 67,68,69,70,71: 5 turns to eat.\n> \n> Now, distance: Manhattan distance |4-1| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6, so minimum 6 moves, but I have 5 turns? Turns 67,68,69,70,71: that's 5 actions, but I need 6 moves, so I might not reach in time with direct path, but I can take a shorter path or something.\n> \n> |dx| = 3, |dy| = 3, so min moves 6, but I have only 5 turns to move and eat.\n> \n> Turns: to eat on turn t, I need to move to (1,2) on that turn.\n> \n> So I need to arrive at (1,2) on one of turn 67 to 71.\n> \n> From current position (4,5) at turn 67, to (1,2).\n> \n> Number of moves: if I go directly, it takes at least 6 moves, so I could arrive on turn 67 + 6 = 73, which is too late, turn 73 > 71.\n> \n> Turn 67: start from (4,5)\n> \n> After 1 move: turn 67, to say (3,5) or other.\n> \n> After 2 moves: turn 68\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After k moves, at turn 67 + k -1?

Impossible, not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells only.\n> \n> So earliest I can eat is when I am adjacent to (1,2) and move to it.\n> \n> But (1,2) is at corner, adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,2) but x=0 wall, so (1,1), (1,3), (2,2).\n> \n> (1,3) is obstacle, wall, so only (1,1) and (2,2) are possible approach cells.\n> \n> (2,2) might be free?

Walls: internal obstacles, (3,6) is wall, but (3,5) is not listed, and not border since x=3, y=5, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,5) should be free, except for snake.\n> \n> But it is snake tail, so moving there is ok.\n> \n> Similarly, move U to (4,6): (4,6) - is it wall? Internal obstacles: (3,6), (5,6) are walls, but (4,6) not listed, so should be free? Borders: y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border, x=4 not border, and not in internal obstacles list, so (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6). So (4,6) not there, so free.\n> \n> But snake: is (4,6) occupied? Snake positions: (4,5) is head, (5,5), etc., no (4,6), so free.\n> \n> Move D to (4,4): (4,4) not wall, not snake?

Let's list the positions after move.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0:(4,5), 1:(5,5), 2:(6,5), 3:(6,4), 4:(6,3), 5:(6,2), 6:(6,1), 7:(5,1), 8:(5,2), 9:(4,2), 10:(4,3), 11:(3,3), 12:(3,4), 13:(3,5)\n> \n> After moving left: head to (3,5), but (3,5) is already position 13, so if head moves to (3,5), and since (3,5) is occupied, but it's the tail, so it's ok, but after move, the new positions: head at (3,5), then the body segments: the previous positions from 0 to 12, but since head moved, we add new head and remove tail if no food.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, it adds a new head position and removes the tail position, unless it eats food, in which case tail is not removed, length increases.\n> \n> But in this case, moving to (3,5), which is the current tail position. Since we're moving to the tail, and no food eaten, the tail will be removed, and the new tail will be the previous second last segment.\n> \n> Specifically: after move, new head at (3,5), but since (3,5) was the tail, and we're moving there, it becomes the head, and the tail is removed, which was (3,5), but now it's head, so we remove the old tail, which is (3,5), but it's the same cell, so effectively, the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> The snake consists of segments. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But if the head moves to the current tail cell, since the tail is moving away, it's ok.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), ..., (3,4), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After moving left to (3,5): the new head position is (3,5). Since no food eaten, the tail is removed. The tail was (3,5), so we remove (3,5), but the new head is also (3,5), so it's a bit confusing.\n> \n> Practically, since the head moves to (3,5) and it was the tail, after the move, the head is at (3,5), and the tail was removed, but since it's the same cell, the snake should now have one less segment? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a misconception.\n> \n> In snake games, when the head moves to the tail cell, since the tail will move away at the same time, there is no collision, and the snake length remains the same, but the head occupies the cell that was tail, and the tail moves to the next position.\n> \n> In terms of the list: when moving, we add the new head position and remove the last position (tail).\n> \n> So if new head is the same as current tail, we add it and remove it, so the cell is occupied, but the segment count decreases? No.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions: head at A, tail at B, and A and B are adjacent. If head moves to B, new head at B, and we remove the old tail, which was B, so we add B and remove B, which is null, but then the new positions are the body without the last segment.\n> \n> Let's take a small example.\n> \n> Suppose snake with 2 segments: head at (1,1), tail at (1,2). Head moving right, say.\n> \n> If it moves down to (1,2), which is tail. New head at (1,2), and remove tail (1,2), so now the snake has only one segment at (1,2). But that means the snake shortened, which is not correct.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> In standard snake, when the head moves to the tail cell, since the tail moves at the same time, the head occupies the tail cell, and the tail is removed, but because the tail was there, it's not a collision, and the snake length should remain the same, but in this case, with two segments, after moving head to tail, it should have head at tail and no tail, but that means length 1.\n> \n> But in reality, for a longer snake, it should be fine.\n> \n> Another way: the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail only if no food eaten.\n> \n> If the new head position is the current tail position, then after adding new head, the tail is removed, so that cell is now head, and the previous tail is gone, so the snake has the same number of segments, but the head is now where tail was, and the body is shifted.\n> \n> In the list, for a snake with multiple segments, when head moves to a new cell, we prepend that cell to the positions list, and remove the last one.\n> \n> So if the new head cell is the current tail cell, we add it to the front, and remove it from the end, so it's still in the list, but now at the head, and the previous last is removed, so the segment that was second last becomes new tail.\n> \n> In my earlier small example: positions [ (1,1), (1,2) ] head at (1,1), tail at (1,2).\n> \n> If head moves to (1,2), new positions: add (1,2) to front, so [ (1,2), (1,1), (1,2) ]? No, we only add one new position.\n> \n> Standard: new head position is (1,2), so positions become [ (1,2), (1,1) ], and then remove tail, which was (1,2), so we remove (1,2), leaving [ (1,1) ]. So now head at (1,1), with no body, length 1.\n> \n> But originally length 2, after move to tail, length 1. That means the snake shortened, which is incorrect for the game.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Upon second thought, in snake games, moving to the tail position is safe and does not shorten the snake; the tail moves away, so the head can occupy the cell that was tail without issue, and the snake length remains the same.\n> \n> In terms of collision, it's only a problem if the head moves to a body cell that is not the tail.\n> \n> For the tail, it's safe.\n> \n> In the position list, when head moves to tail cell, we add the new head position (which is the old tail position), and remove the old tail position, so it's the same as not changing the list for that cell, but the head is now there, and the new tail is the previous position.\n> \n> Let's take a longer snake.\n> \n> Suppose positions: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n> \n> If head moves to C, new head position C, so new positions: [C, A, B], then remove tail C, so [A, B], with A as head, B as tail. So the snake has moved, and length is the same, but the head is now at C, which was tail, and the body is A and B.\n> \n> In this case, from [A,B,C] to [C,A,B] after move, but when we remove tail, we remove C, so positions become [C,A,B] minus C, so [A,B], so head at A, tail at B. But A was not moved, so it's messy.\n> \n> I think the correct way is: the new positions are the old positions shifted, with new head prepended and tail removed.\n> \n> So from [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell N.\n> \n> New positions: [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] if no food, so tail Pk removed.\n> \n> If N is Pk, then new positions: [Pk, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}], and since we remove Pk, it becomes [P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}], so the snake is shorter by one segment.\n> \n> But that means moving to the tail shortens the snake, which is not the case in standard rules.\n> \n> I think for this game, we should follow the rule given: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So it is safe, and the snake does not shorten; the head moves to the tail cell, and the tail moves away, so the cell is vacated by tail and occupied by head at the same time, no collision.\n> \n> In terms of position update, when head moves to tail cell, we do not remove the tail; instead, we add the new head and the tail remains for that turn, but since it's the same cell, it's fine, but then when the tail moves next time, it leaves.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that for that move, since head moves to tail, no change in length, and positions are updated with head at new position and tail removed, but since new position is old tail, the list has the new head and the body without the old tail.\n> \n> For example, snake [A,B,C] head A tail C.\n> \n> Move head to C: new head at C, so positions become [C, A, B], and tail B.

No.\n> \n> Original positions have 14 cells.\n> \n> After move, we add new head position, so temporarily 15 positions, then remove tail, so back to 14 positions if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, new head at (3,5), which is the old tail position, so when we add (3,5) as new head, the list has 15 positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (3,4), (3,5) ] since old tail was (3,5), so we have two (3,5) in the list?

It's turn 68. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). Snake positions: head is at (3,5), then body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). That's 14 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food: two items. First is at (1,2) with value 1 and life span 4. Second is at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,2), life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 68+4=72, it vanishes. Similarly, (5,1) has life span 9, so disappears after turn 68+9=77.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 68.

List: indices: 0: (3,5) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (5,2), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,4).

Snake positions include (5,1) at index 8. But food at (5,1) is listed.

After moving, the new tail will be the previous segment, which is (3,3)? Positions: after moving down, head to (3,4), then the body: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to (3,5), and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> Let's list positions in order: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), ..., 12: (3,3), 13: tail (3,4).\n> \n> If head moves down to (3,4), which is currently index 13.\n> \n> After move: new head at (3,4). Then the body segment that was at index 1, (4,5), moves to the old head position (3,5). Similarly, index 2 (5,5) moves to (4,5), and so on, until index 12 (3,3) moves to where? The segment that was at index 13, (3,4), but now head is moving to (3,4), so the new body positions: head at (3,4), then the first body segment is old index 0 position (3,5), but since head moved down, the first body segment goes to (3,5), which was head, then index 1 goes to (4,5), no.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the neck moves to where head was, and each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the one before it, and the tail segment is left, so the cell that was tail is vacated unless the snake grows.\n> \n> Since we're not eating food, length doesn't change, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: new head position is the move destination. Then the new position for segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i=1 to len-1, and the tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving head to (3,4), new positions: head at (3,4), then body: segment 1 at old head (3,5), segment 2 at old segment 1 (4,5), segment 3 at old segment 2 (5,5), ..., segment 13 at old segment 12 (3,3). Old segment 12 was (3,3), so new segment 13 at (3,3), and the old tail (3,4) is now head, so the cell (3,4) is occupied by head, but it was tail, but after move, it's head, and the tail is now at (3,3), so no issue, no collision because the old tail is no longer there when head moves in.\n> \n> In terms of collision check: when moving, if the new head position is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's collision.

If it's moving down from (3,5) to (3,4), then y=5 to y=4, y decreases, so down decreases y. So (0,0) is bottom-left, y increases up, x increases right. Standard Cartesian with origin bottom-left.\n> \n> In many games, (0,0) top-left, y increases down, but here since head direction D down, and positions, let's confirm.\n> \n> If head is at (3,4) and moving down to, say, (3,3), but next position is (3,5), which has higher y, so if moving down to (3,4), it came from (3,5), so (3,5) to (3,4), y from 5 to 4, so y decreases when moving down. Therefore, (0,0) is bottom-left, y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall? But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so playable y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=1 is bottom row, y=6 is top row? Let's see: snake has (6,1), which is bottom row if y=1 is low, and (3,5) is higher y.\n> \n> In the position list, (6,1) to (5,1) to (5,2), so y=1 to y=2, y increasing.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction down, so next move down would be to (3,3).\n> \n> But let's not get distracted.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2,3,1) — this is confusing. Food is given as ( (x,y), value, life_span )\n> \n> It says: Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (1,2,3,1) and (5,1,8,1)\n> \n> Probably it's (x,y, value, life_span) or ( (x,y), value, life_span )? The format says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> \n> But here it's written as (1,2,3,1) which might be a tuple, so (1,2) is position, 3 is value, 1 is life_span? Value should be +1 or -1, but 3? That can't be.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1,2,3,1) - (5,1,8,1)\"\n> \n> And in the core rules, food has value +1 or -1, but here it's 3 and 8? That must be a mistake.\n> \n> Perhaps it's ( (x,y), value, life_span ) so for first one, (1,2) is position, 3 is value? But value should be +1 or -1, not 3. Life span is 1? But 3 is not a standard value.\n> \n> Another possibility: it might be misformatted. Let's see the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1,2,3,1) - (5,1,8,1)\"\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x, y, life_span, value) or something. But value should be +1 or -1.\n> \n> I think there's a typo. In the core rules, it says value is +1 or -1, but here it's 3 and 8, which might be the life span? But life span is given separately.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" in the state input format.\n> \n> Then in current state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1,2,3,1) - (5,1,8,1)\"\n> \n> The order might be position, then life span, then value? But value is 1 for both, I think.\n> \n> (1,2,3,1) — if position is (1,2), then 3 could be life span, 1 could be value? Similarly, (5,1,8,1) position (5,1), life span 8, value 1.\n> \n> Value 1 means +1, since positive food.\n> \n> Similarly, first one value 1, so +1 food.\n> \n> But life span for first is 3, second is 8.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So:\n> \n> - Food at (1,2): life span 3, value +1 (positive)\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): life span 8, value +1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, good.\n> \n> Now, life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 69, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 69 + 3 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> Life span N: appears for N turns, starting from when it spawned. But here it's given at current turn.\n> \n> For a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it has L turns left including current turn. After L turns, it will be gone. For example, at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Here turn t=69.\n> \n> First food at (1,2): life span 3, so it can be eaten on turn 69, 70, 71; disappears at turn 72.\n> \n> Second food at (5,1): life span 8, can be eaten from turn 69 to 76; disappears at 77.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), direction Down.\n> \n> Current possible moves: since direction is Down, cannot move Up instantly (no instant reverse), so can move Down, Left, Right. But need to check walls and body.\n> \n> Grid: playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7; y=0,7; internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So internal walls at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> Snake body positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Tail is (3,3)\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2) and (5,1)\n> \n> (5,1) is occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (5,1), which is the 10th segment: positions index from 0: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So (5,1) is a body segment, specifically the snake is on that cell.\n> \n> But there is food at (5,1) with value +1 and life span 8.\n> \n> According to rules, food can spawn under snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is a free cell? Let's see if any snake or wall there.\n> \n> (1,2): x=1,y=2. Walls: internal obstacles include (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), etc., but not (1,2). Snake positions: none at (1,2), so (1,2) is free with food.\n> \n> (5,1) has snake body and food.\n> \n> Now, current possible moves from (3,4) direction Down.\n> \n> Can move: Down, Left, Right. Cannot move Up (reverse).\n> \n> - Down: to (3,3). But (3,3) is the tail position. Tail is at (3,3), and head moving to (3,3) might be ok if tail moves, but need to see.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (4,4)\n> \n> First, check if cells are valid.\n> \n> (3,3): is it occupied? Snake has (3,3) as tail, but when head moves, the tail will also move, so moving to tail position is generally safe because the tail moves away, unless it's a special case like tail reward danger.\n> \n> (2,4): is it free? x=2,y=4. Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (1,3), (2,3), but (2,4) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: none at (2,4), so free.\n> \n> (4,4): x=4,y=4. No walls, no snake, should be free.\n> \n> Now, about moving to (3,3): it's the tail, so if head moves to (3,3), and tail moves away, it should be ok, but there might be food or something. Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (3,3), head at (3,4), so adjacent vertically. If head moves to (3,3) and eats food there, but is there food at (3,3)? Food is at (1,2) and (5,1), not at (3,3), so no food to eat. So moving to (3,3) should be safe because tail moves to next position.\n> \n> When head moves to (3,3), the new head is (3,3), and the tail, which was at (3,3), but now head is there, so tail will move to the next segment. Positions: after move down, head to (3,3), then the body: previous head (3,4) becomes neck, so snake becomes: new head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), ..., up to (4,3) or something. Tail was (3,3), but now head is at (3,3), so the segment that was tail will be removed or something? Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail moves away; if food, tail stays, snake grows.\n> \n> But here, moving to (3,3) which is current tail position.\n> \n> Case 1: if no food at (3,3), then head moves to (3,3), tail moves away to the previous position of the second last segment, so snake shortens or stays same length? When head moves to empty cell, tail moves, so length same. Here, (3,3) is occupied by tail, but since it's the tail, when head moves in, tail moves out, so effectively, the cell is vacated and head occupies it, no collision.\n> \n> Specifically, after move: head to (3,3), which was tail, so now the new snake positions: head (3,3), then previous positions except tail is removed, so body from (3,4) to ... but (3,4) was head, now body, then (3,5), etc., up to the segment before tail. Tail was (3,3), so it's gone, new tail is the second last, which was (4,3)? Positions: indices: let's say positions[0] = head (3,4), [1]=(3,5), [2]=(4,5), [3]=(5,5), [4]=(6,5), [5]=(6,4), [6]=(6,3), [7]=(6,2), [8]=(6,1), [9]=(5,1), [10]=(5,2), [11]=(4,2), [12]=(4,3), [13]=(3,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (3,3): new head at (3,3), then the body: the segment that was [0] becomes [1], so (3,4) becomes neck, then [1] becomes [2], so (3,5), then [2]=(4,5), ..., up to [12]=(4,3), and tail [13]=(3,3) is removed because we moved to an empty cell? But (3,3) was occupied, but since it's the tail, and no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> General rule: if head moves to a cell not food, then tail is removed, so snake moves forward, length same.\n> \n> If head moves to food, tail not removed, length increases by one.\n> \n> Here, moving to (3,3), which has no food (food at (1,2) and (5,1) only), so no food, so tail is removed, new snake: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3) — and (3,3) is head, so the old tail is gone, new tail is (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) was position [12], now new tail.\n> \n> No collision because the tail moved.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,3) is now head, and it was tail, but since we moved there, it's fine.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (3,4) down:\n> \n> - Down to (3,3): as above, safe, no food.\n> \n> - Left to (2,4): free cell, safe.\n> \n> - Right to (4,4): free cell, safe.\n> \n> Cannot go up to (3,5) because it's body and reverse, but (3,5) is body segment, and moving up would be reverse direction, which is not allowed, and also occupied.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score.\n> \n> Food: (1,2) with life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 71, else gone.\n> \n> (5,1) with life span 8, more time.\n> \n> But (5,1) is under snake body, specifically at position [9]=(5,1), which is a body segment.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body moves away from (5,1), and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (3,4), far from (5,1).\n> \n> Also, (1,2) is at (1,2), which is closer.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid 6x6: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (since walls at 0 and 7, so playable 1-6).\n> \n> y=1 bottom, y=6 top; x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Internal walls: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (3,6): top row, x=3,y=6\n> \n> - (2,1): bottom row, x=2,y=1\n> \n> - (1,3): left, x=1,y=3\n> \n> - (2,3): x=2,y=3\n> \n> - (5,6): top, x=5,y=6\n> \n> - (5,3): x=5,y=3\n> \n> - (5,4): x=5,y=4\n> \n> - (1,6): top-left, x=1,y=6\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head (3,4)\n> \n> Then: (3,5) y=5, up\n> \n> (4,5) x=4,y=5\n> \n> (5,5) x=5,y=5\n> \n> (6,5) x=6,y=5\n> \n> (6,4) down to y=4\n> \n> (6,3) down to y=3\n> \n> (6,2) down to y=2\n> \n> (6,1) down to y=1\n> \n> (5,1) left to x=5,y=1\n> \n> (5,2) up to y=2?

No, head (3,4) down would be to (3,3), but it's connected to (3,5) which is up, so the snake has a bend.\n> \n> From (3,4) to (3,5) is up, then to (4,5) right, then to (5,5) right, to (6,5) right, to (6,4) down, to (6,3) down, to (6,2) down, to (6,1) down, to (5,1) left, to (5,2) up, to (4,2) left, to (4,3) up, to (3,3) left.\n> \n> So tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Food at (1,2): x=1,y=2, which is bottom-left area.

segment comes, but since the snake is connected, when it moves, the cell is vacated only if the segment leaves and the next segment doesn't come, but in snake, the segments move sequentially, so when a segment leaves a cell, it might be occupied by the next segment or not, but in this case, since the segments are moving to the previous position, the cell is vacated only if no segment moves into it, which happens when the tail leaves a cell and no growth.\n> \n> For example, when the tail moves away from a cell, that cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for (5,1), it is not the tail, so it will be

Internal obstacles: (1,6) is wall, but (1,5) not listed as wall.

After move without eating, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so 13 segments? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So positions: start with [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to new head position, new body: [new head, H, B1, B2, ..., second last], so T is removed.\n> \n> Here, positions: index 0: head (1,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), 10: (6,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (5,2), 13: (4,2) so tail is (4,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) without eating, new head: (1,5), then body: (1,4) [prev head], (2,4) [prev B1], (3,4) [prev B2], (3,5) [prev B3], (4,5) [prev B4], (5,5) [prev B5], (6,5) [prev B6], (6,4) [prev B7], (6,3) [prev B8], (6,2) [prev B9], (6,1) [prev B10], (5,1) [prev B11], (5,2) [prev B12], and (4,2) is removed.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 71, if not eaten, after turn it becomes 5, then 4, etc., so it will disappear after turn 76? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning after N decreases to 0.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, if not eaten, at turn t+1, life span L-1, and when L=0, it disappears before the next turn or after?

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with some cells blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,5), then body: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards higher y.\n> \n> Food: two pieces. One at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 6 turns. Another at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 8 turns.\n> \n> Life span means how many turns left before it disappears. For (5,1), life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 72 + 6 = 78? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 72, life span is 6, meaning it will be there for 6 more turns, including turn 72. After turn 72, life span becomes 5, and so on, until 0, then it disappears. Similarly for (3,2), life span 8, so disappears after turn 79.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (1,5), direction U.

So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. But since playable area is from 1 to 6 in both x and y, I think x=0 and x=7 are the left and right borders, y=0 bottom, y=7 top. So any move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is invalid.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake body positions: from head to tail: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2).\n> \n> Tail is at (5,2), and the segment before is (5,1), but (5,1) is also a food position?

So (5,1) is the 13th segment? Let's count: position 0: head (1,5), 1: (1,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (6,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (5,2). Tail is (5,2), and (5,1) is the second last segment.\n> \n> But food is at (5,1), which is currently occupied by a body segment. According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (5,1) has food, but it's under a body segment. So if the snake moves such that the body moves away from (5,1), and then head moves to (5,1), it can eat it. But eating food grows the snake, so after eating, a new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> There's also a Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (5,2), and food is at (5,1), which is adjacent to tail? (5,1) and (5,2) are adjacent vertically? (5,1) is above (5,2)? y=1 and y=2, assuming y increases up, since U is (x,y+1), so y=1 is below y=2? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so higher y is up. U (up) is (x,y+1), so from (x,y) to (x,y+1), which is increasing y.\n> \n> So (5,1) has y=1, (5,2) has y=2, so (5,2) is above (5,1), I think. Let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Head at (1,5), which is x=1,y=5. Then (1,4) is down, so y=4. Then (2,4) right to x=2,y=4. Then (3,4) right to x=3,y=4. Then (3,5) up to y=5. Etc.\n> \n> Tail: (6,1) at x=6,y=1, then (5,1) left to x=5,y=1, then (5,2) up to x=5,y=2. So tail is at (5,2), and (5,1) is below it, occupied by body and food.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) is under body, so not accessible now.\n> \n> Other food at (3,2) with life span 8.\n> \n> Now, head at (1,5), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move D (down). So options: U, L, R.\n> \n> Moving U: to (1,6)\n> \n> But (1,6) is an internal obstacle? Walls include (1,6) as internal obstacle, so (1,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,6) is listed, so (1,6) is wall.\n> \n> Moving L: to (0,5), but x=0 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Moving R: to (2,5)\n> \n> Is (2,5) free? Let's see what's at (2,5).\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), etc. (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, so (2,5) is not occupied by snake. Walls: (2,5) is not listed as wall, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, internal obstacles don't include (2,5), so (2,5) should be free.\n> \n> But is it safe? Moving to (2,5) from (1,5) with direction U.\n> \n> After moving, head will be at (2,5), and direction becomes R? No, direction is set by the move, not the previous, I think. The head direction is given as U, but when I move, I choose the action, which sets the new direction.\n> \n> In the state, head direction is U, meaning it was moving up to get to (1,5). Now, from (1,5), if I move R to (2,5), that's right, so new direction is R.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U, but U is invalid, L invalid, so only possible move is R to (2,5)? But I have three options, U, L, R, but U and L are invalid, so only R is possible? But that can't be right, because D is forbidden due to instant reverse.\n> \n> Let me confirm possible moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,5)\n> \n> Current direction: U (up)\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - U: (1,6) - but (1,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (1,4) - but D is opposite to current U, so instant reverse, forbidden. Also, (1,4) is the body segment, so even if not forbidden, it would be body collision unless it's the tail, but it's not the tail; tail is (5,2), and (1,4) is the second segment, so moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> - L: (0,5) - x=0 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (2,5) - not wall, not occupied by body? Body positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). So (2,5) is not in this list, so free cell. Also not wall. So moving R to (2,5) is possible.\n> \n> But is that the only move? What about other directions? D is forbidden and occupied, U and L walls, so yes, only R is possible at turn 72.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns. The action sequence should be for turn 72 and subsequent turns.\n> \n> Turn 72: I must move R to (2,5).\n> \n> Then, after that, head at (2,5), direction R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to plan future moves to eat food and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, food locations: (5,1) with life span 6, so available until turn 77 (since turn 72: life 6, turn 73:5, ..., turn 77:1, turn 78:0 disappear? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 72, life span 6, it means after 6 turns, at turn 78, it disappears. Similarly, (3,2) life span 8, disappears at turn 80.\n> \n> Now, (5,1) is currently under the body at (5,1), which is part of the snake. To eat it, the body must move away, and head move to it.\n> \n> Currently, the body segment at (5,1) will move when the snake moves. Since snake moves one step each turn, the segments shift.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is free, I think. Let's see what's at (3,2).\n> \n> Is (3,2) occupied? Snake positions: all listed, (3,2) not there. Walls: internal obstacles include (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,3), etc., but not (3,2). Borders not. So (3,2) should be free and has food.\n> \n> So I can go for (3,2) directly.\n> \n> But (3,2) is at x=3,y=2, head now at (1,5), after moving to (2,5), head at (2,5).\n> \n> From (2,5), I can move to (3,2)? Not directly, need to move step by step.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid collisions and plan path.\n> \n> Moreover, there's the food at (5,1) which might be eaten later.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to see free cells.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n> \n> (1,6) is obstacle, (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,6), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> (5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, so column x=5 has obstacles at y=3,4,6? (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\n> \n> (5,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> Also (3,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Now, snake body occupies multiple cells.\n> \n> At turn 72, after move, head to (2,5).\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> At turn 72, before move: positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n> \n> I move R to (2,5).\n> \n> So new head position: (2,5)\n> \n> Then the body: the tail will move, but since no food eaten, snake doesn't grow, so tail is removed, and new head added.\n> \n> After move: head at (2,5), then the previous head (1,5) becomes body, so positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)] and tail (5,2) is removed? Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (1,5) head, 1: (1,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (6,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (5,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving R to (2,5): new head is (2,5), then the body is the previous segments but shifted; the segment that was at index 0 is now at new position, but since we move, the new body is: [new head (2,5), then previous head (1,5), then previous body 1: (1,4), then 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (6,1), 12: (5,1)] and the tail (5,2) is removed, so positions become 14 segments? Original had 14 positions? Count: from 0 to 13, that's 14 segments.\n> \n> After moving without eating, the snake length stays the same, so we add new head and remove tail.\n> \n> So new positions: head: (2,5), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) — and (5,2) is removed.\n> \n> So tail is now (5,1), which has food under it? Food is at (5,1), and now (5,1) is the tail segment.\n> \n> In the positions, (5,1) is occupied by snake, with food.\n> \n> Now, at turn 72, after move, head at (2,5), direction R.\n> \n> Now turn 73, I need to choose next action.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5) with direction R.\n> \n> Directions: U, D, L, R. L is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, so instant reverse L is forbidden.\n> \n> So possible: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> - U: (2,6) — is it free? y=6, but y=6 is not border? Borders y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1-6. Walls: internal obstacles, (3,6) but not (2,6). Snake positions: after move, positions are (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So (2,6) not occupied. Not wall, so U to (2,6) possible.\n> \n> - D: (2,4) — (2,4) is occupied by body? Positions: (2,4) is in the list, index 3? New positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), ... so (2,4) is the fourth segment, not tail, so moving to (2,4) would be body collision. Also, D is down, which is not reverse? Current direction R, D is perpendicular, not opposite. Opposite of R is L, which is forbidden. U and D are perpendicular, so allowed. But (2,4) is occupied, so cannot move D.\n> \n> - R: (3,5) — (3,5) is occupied? Positions: (3,5) is there, index 5? Positions: (2,5) head, (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), etc. so (3,5) is the sixth segment, not free. So moving to (3,5) would collide.\n> \n> Therefore, from (2,5), only possible move is U to (2,6).\n> \n> Is that right? U to (2,6): not wall, not occupied, as above.\n> \n> D and R are occupied, L forbidden.\n> \n> So at turn 73, must move U to (2,6).\n> \n> Then head to (2,6), direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 74.\n> \n> Head at (2,6), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> U: (2,7) — y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (2,5) — but D is opposite to current U?

That can't be.\n> \n> (2,6) to U: (2,7) y=7 wall.\n> \n> D: (2,5) — but (2,5) is previous head position, now body? Positions after turn 73: head moved to (2,6), so positions: head (2,6), then previous head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) — tail at (5,1).\n> \n> (2,5) is now body segment.\n> \n> Moving D to (2,5) is body collision, and also D is reverse, forbidden.\n> \n> L to (1,6): wall.\n> \n> R to (3,6): wall.\n> \n> So no valid moves? But that means snake is trapped and will die. But at turn 72, I had to move R, then to U, and now stuck.\n> \n> But at turn 72, head at (1,5), I moved R to (2,5), which was the only move, then at (2,5), only U to (2,6), then at (2,6), no moves.

Not a valid move.\n\n- **Attempting to Move Down (D) to (2, 4)**:\n  - (2, 4) is occupied by the snake's body (segment 3).\n  - **Result**: Immediate collision with the body.

However, this move leads to an unavoidable dead end on the next turn. \n\nSince the instruction is to decide the immediate action for the current turn \\( t_0 = 73 \\), and no other moves are viable, the action must be:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 73, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls and can't be moved to.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]. So these cells are blocked and I must avoid them.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,5), and it's moving right, so direction is R. The body segments are: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (6,1)\n> \n> - Tail: (5,1)\n> \n> The tail is at (5,1), and there's food at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 5. But food at (5,1) is under the tail? Let's see: snake positions include (5,1), which is the tail. So food is under the tail.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1): value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,2): value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1) it's 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn. So after turn 73, it has 4 turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 73, life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + N - 1? No.\n> \n> If at turn t, life_span is N, then:\n> \n> - On turn t, countdown is N\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - It disappears when countdown reaches 0, so after N turns from now, it's gone. Specifically, it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 73, life_span 5: it is available on turns 73,74,75,76,77? Countdown starts at N and decreases each turn.\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown = N\n> \n> - After turn t (turn t+1), countdown = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When countdown = 1, after that turn, it disappears? I think it's better to think: the food is present for N turns, including the current turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, if life_span is N, countdown is N. After the turn, it decreases to N-1. When countdown reaches 0 after a turn, it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, it happens during the turn when head moves to it.\n> \n> For simplicity: food with life_span N at turn t will be available until the end of turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> For (5,1): life_span 5 at turn 73, so available on turns 73,74,75,76,77? Turn 73: countdown=5, after turn 73, countdown=4, so it decreases after each turn. It should be available as long as countdown > 0.\n> \n> - Start of turn 73: countdown=5, food present\n> \n> - After turn 73 actions: countdown decreases to 4\n> \n> - Start of turn 74: countdown=4, food present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Start of turn 77: countdown=1, food present\n> \n> - After turn 77: countdown=0, food disappears\n> \n> So food is present from turn 73 to turn 77 inclusive, and gone at turn 78.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (3,2): life_span 7, available from turn 73 to 79\n> \n> (6,4): life_span 10, available from turn 73 to 82\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,5), direction R, so last move was right to (2,5) from (1,5)?

Here, (2,5) is not the tail (tail is at (6,1)), so moving into it causes a collision.\n- **Direction Reversal**: The snake cannot move in the opposite direction (down) immediately after moving up.\n- **Wall Collision**: Moving into any wall cell (border or internal) is invalid.\n\n### Verification of Surroundings\n\n- **Adjacent Cells to (2,6)**:\n  - (2,7): Wall (border).\n  - (2,5): Snake body (not tail).\n  - (1,6): Wall (internal).\n  - (3,6): Wall (internal).\n\n- **No Free Cells**: There are no unoccupied or non-wall cells adjacent to the head.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the current state and the rules:\n- **No valid action exists** that avoids collision or wall collision.\n- The snake is effectively trapped with no possible moves.\n\n### Action\n\nSince the problem requires an action, and all possible actions lead to death, the only logical response is to acknowledge the impossibility of a valid move. However, as the format demands an action, we must choose one, even if it leads to a collision.\n\n\\boxed{D} \n\n**Note**: This move is invalid as it reverses direction and collides with the body, but it is the only possible \"action\" to choose given the constraints. The snake will die upon executing this move.",

It's turn 74. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those edges. Also, internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).

Snake length is 14 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up, so moving in the positive y-direction? In coordinates, U is (x, y+1), so y increases up, I assume. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U: (x,y+1), so let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, and y increases upwards, x increases right. But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.

Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so snake can't go there. Internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).
