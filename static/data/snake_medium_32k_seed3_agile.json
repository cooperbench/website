Valid.\n  - Left (L): to (0, 4).\n    - Check: \\( x=0 \\) is a wall. Invalid.\n  - Right (R): to (2, 4).\n    - Check: (2, 4) is an internal obstacle. Invalid.\n  - Down (D): to (1, 3).\n    - Check: (1, 3) is the tail. Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves away. However, this is a reverse move (opposite to current direction U), which is prohibited. Invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The only valid move at Turn 3 is **Up (U)** to (1, 5).\n\n### Verification:\n- After moving U to (1, 5):\n  - New head position: (1, 5).\n  - Tail (1, 3) is removed, body becomes (1, 4).\n  - Snake positions: [(1, 5), (1, 4)].\n  - Direction remains U (since the move is in the same direction).\n  - No food is eaten, so length remains 2.\n\n### Next Steps (for context):\n- At Turn 4, the snake will be at (1, 5), direction U.\n- Possible moves:\n  - U to (1, 6): but (1, 6) is an obstacle. Invalid.\n  - D: reverse, not allowed.\n  - L to (0, 5): wall. Invalid.\n  - R to (2, 5): valid and has food.

Eating it now ensures we don't miss the opportunity.\n2. **Safety**: Moving right to (5,6) is safe because:\n   - (5,6) is not occupied by the snake's body or walls.\n   - The tail is at (5,5), which is diagonally adjacent to the head (not directly adjacent), so no tail reward danger exists.\n3. **No Better Option**: \n   - Moving down (D) to (4,5) avoids the food but doesn't provide any immediate benefit and may lead to dead ends later.\n   - Moving left (L) is invalid (opposite of current direction R).\n   - Moving up (U) is invalid (hits the wall at y=7).\n\n### Long-Term Consideration:\nWhile this move may lead to challenges in future turns (e.g., potential dead ends), it is the optimal choice for Turn 74 to secure the +1 reward and avoid losing the food. Subsequent moves can be planned to navigate the snake away from traps. \n\n### Next Steps (for future turns):\nAfter eating the food at (5,6), the snake will grow, and the next move could be:\n- Down (D) to (5,5) to avoid the corner, or \n- Right (R) to (6,6) if space allows, though this risks trapping the snake later. \n\nHowever, as a non-thinking executor, only the immediate action for Turn 74 is required: \\boxed{R}.",
