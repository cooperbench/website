Since the snake is only one segment long, eating food will increase its length. But I have to be careful with tail reward danger, but right now, with length 1, there is no tail, so that shouldn't be an issue yet.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and collides. But with length 1, tail is the head itself? No, positions are given as list, head first. With one segment, head and tail are the same cell. But when it eats, it grows, so after eating, length becomes 2.\n> \n> Let me read the food mechanics carefully.\n> \n> When snake eats positive food, length increases by 1. Negative food, length unchanged.\n> \n> But for tail reward danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> With one segment, head and tail are the same cell, so they are not adjacent; adjacent means next to, not the same. So probably, with length 1, there is no tail adjacent issue. When it eats, it grows, so after eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the head was, so tail is now that new segment.\n> \n> But initially, with no body, no issue.\n> \n> Now, movement: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse.

But the rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", meaning for the action I choose now.\n> \n> Let me read: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So for turn t1, since current direction is L, I cannot choose R for turn t1 action.

It's turn 1, and the snake is at position (2,3), heading left. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). The snake is only one segment long right now, so it's just the head. That means there's no body to collide with except itself, but since it's alone, collisions aren't an issue yet.

Life spans are high, so they won't disappear soon.\n> \n> Since the snake is at (2,3) and heading left, possible moves are U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But I need to consider the no instant reverse rule. Current direction is L (left), so I cannot move right immediately, as that would be the opposite direction.\n> \n> So, allowed moves: U, D, L. Not R.\n> \n> Now, the grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so yes, 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally. Walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so we can't go to those cells.

But I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, if I move left to (1,3), I eat the food. Since the snake is only one segment, eating food will make it grow to two segments: head and tail both at (1,3)? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, but since it was moving, the tail might stay or move? Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, since snake is one cell, if it eats food at (1,3), head moves to (1,3), and since it was alone, now the tail is also at (1,3)? That might cause immediate collision.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> But also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake.\n> \n> Here, since snake is one cell, head and tail are the same point? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Snake positions: currently [(2,3)], so only one segment. Head and tail are the same.\n> \n> If I move to a food cell, I eat it, and the snake grows. So after eating, positions should be, say if I move to (1,3), which has food, so head moves to (1,3), and since it grows, the tail remains at (2,3) for that turn? I think I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the snake moves, head goes to new position, and tail follows, unless food is eaten, in which case tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> But here, since it's turn-based, on each turn, you choose direction, head moves one step, if that cell has food, you eat it and grow (tail doesn't move), else tail moves forward.\n> \n> But with only one segment, it's special.\n> \n> At turn 1, snake at [(2,3)].\n> \n> I choose a direction, say L.\n> \n> Head moves to (1,3). Since (1,3) has food, I eat it. So now snake positions: head at (1,3), and since it grew, a new segment is added, but where? Since the tail was at (2,3) and didn't move, now the snake has two segments: head at (1,3) and tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Then, next turn, if I move, head moves to new position, tail moves to (1,3) or stays? When head moves, tail moves forward unless food was eaten.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move on that turn, so positions become [head new, and old position becomes body].\n> \n> In this case: start [(2,3)] -> move to (1,3), eat food, so now snake is [(1,3), (2,3)] with head at (1,3), tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Then next turn, if I move, say left again to (0,3), but x=0 is wall, so I die if I go there.\n> \n> But (1,3) to left is (0,3), which is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Back to the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, when snake is one cell, if I move to a food cell, head and tail are both at the same cell after eating? No, after moving and eating, head is at food cell, tail is at previous position.\n> \n> So they are not adjacent; they are separate.\n> \n> For example, from (2,3) move L to (1,3), eat food, now head at (1,3), tail at (2,3), which are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Then, if I were to eat the food at tail, but the food is already eaten; the cell is empty now.\n> \n> The danger is when the tail cell has food, meaning there is food on the tail position, and head moves to it.\n> \n> But in this case, when snake has multiple segments.\n> \n> For now, with one segment, it should be fine.\n> \n> But let's confirm the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Here, with one segment, head and tail are the same, so they are adjacent? Distance zero, which is adjacent, I think.\n> \n> Adjacent means next to, not same cell.\n> \n> Typically, adjacent means neighboring cells, not the same cell.\n> \n> In grid terms, adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, not the same cell.\n> \n> So if head and tail are on the same cell, it might not be considered adjacent; adjacent implies different cells.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail\" — so if they are on different but neighboring cells.\n> \n> When head and tail are on the same cell, it's not adjacent; it's coincident.\n> \n> In this state, snake is one cell, so no adjacency.\n> \n> If I move to a food cell, I eat it, grow to two segments, head and tail on different cells, adjacent if it was a direct move.\n> \n> But the danger only when tail cell has food and head moves to it while adjacent.\n> \n> In this case, after eating, the tail cell is (2,3), which may or may not have food; in this case, (2,3) is empty now, I think, since food was eaten.\n> \n> Food was at (1,3), eaten, so cell is empty.\n> \n> No food on tail cell.\n> \n> So no danger.\n> \n> But let's not digress.\n> \n> For now, I can eat the food at (1,3) by moving left.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Available moves from (2,3): U, D, L, R but cannot R because current direction is L, so no instant reverse, so cannot move right.

No, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see the snake position: snake is at (1,4) and (1,3), so x=1 is within 1 to 6, y=3 and 4 are within 1 to 6.

It's turn 4, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7; those cells are blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). So I need to avoid those cells too.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (1,5), and tail at (1,4). Since it's a list with head first, so head (1,5), body (1,4). But the snake has only two segments? Positions are [(1,5), (1,4)], so yes, length 2. Head direction is U, which is up. Since moving up increases y, so from (1,5) moving U would go to (1,6), but y=6 is within bounds? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is ok, but let's check obstacles.\n> \n> y=0 to y=7, so y=7 is wall, meaning (x,7) for any x is wall. Similarly, (0,y) and (7,y) are walls. Internal obstacles are specific cells.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All foods have value 1 and are positive, since value is +1. No negative food mentioned here. Value is given as 1, and from rules, positive food has +1, negative has -1, so all these are positive foods.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is L, then on turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten until the turn when countdown reaches 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the turn when it's spawned, countdown is life_span. Then each turn, including that one, it decreases? No.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, then during turn t, it can be eaten, and at the end of turn t, life span decreases to L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains; if L-1=0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous. I think the standard way is: food is present for N turns, including the turn it appears.\n> \n> For example, life span 6 at turn 4: it will be available on turns 4,5,6,7,8,9? Let's count.\n> \n> Turn 4: life span 6, so after turn 4, it decreases to 5.\n> \n> After turn 5, to 4, and so on, until after turn 9, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 inclusive? When the snake moves to the cell on turn t, it eats it if present.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn t, food is present with some life span. Snake moves, if head lands on food, it eats it. Then, after the move, life span decreases for all food.\n> \n> Similarly for this state.\n> \n> Current turn t=4.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,3): life span 6, so available from turn 4 to turn 9 (since after turn 9, it would be 0 and disappear)\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn including current, but \"including current\" might mean that at turn t, when we start, life span is L, and after turn t, it becomes L-1.\n> \n> But for eating, during turn t, if head moves to food, it eats it before life span decrease.\n> \n> I think it's fine; we can think the food is there until life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5): life span 6, same\n> \n> (2,5): life span 7, so available longer\n> \n> (4,5): life span 10, long time\n> \n> Now snake: head at (1,5), direction U (up).

From (1,4) to (1,5) by moving U, yes.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite, and no instant reverse. So possible moves: U (up to (1,6)), L (left to (0,5)? but x=0 is wall, so L to (0,5) is invalid), R (right to (2,5)), or D (down to (1,4)? but (1,4) is current tail.\n> \n> Let's list possible actions from (1,5) with direction U.\n> \n> - U: to (1,6)\n> \n> - D: to (1,4) but D is opposite to U, so cannot move D because of no instant reverse.

Snake is at (1,5) and (1,4), so (2,5) is not snake. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed, so should be free. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, but (2,5) x=2 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so ok.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,5) is present? Food positions: (2,5) has food with life span 7, value 1.\n> \n> So moving R to (2,5) is possible and would eat the food.\n> \n> But let's confirm if I can eat it.\n> \n> Food at (2,5), snake head moving to (2,5), so yes, if it moves there, it eats it.\n> \n> Now, since snake is length 2, eating positive food increases length to 3, so after eating, positions would be head at (2,5), and body segments: since tail was at (1,4), but when head moves to new position, the body follows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell, if it's food, snake grows, so new head position, and tail doesn't move? No.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when you eat food, the tail extends, meaning that after move, head is at new position, and the previous tail stays or something.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat food, you grow, so the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> But in terms of movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> If not eating, tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> If eating, tail stays, so a new segment is added.\n> \n> In this case, currently positions: head (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> If I move R to (2,5) and eat food, then new head is (2,5), and since eating, the tail doesn't move, so body becomes (1,5) and tail (1,4), so positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]\n> \n> Head at (2,5), then (1,5) is body, (1,4) is tail.\n> \n> Length increased to 3.\n> \n> If I don't eat, and just move, say to (1,6), but (1,6) is obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> Only possible move is R to (2,5), which has food, so I must move there and eat it.\n> \n> But is that safe? Let's see.\n> \n> After moving to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> Now, direction: I moved R, so new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.\n> \n> But first, at turn 4, action must be R, since it's the only possible move.\n> \n> Is that true?\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,5) with dir U: U, L, R, D but D opposite invalid, L to (0,5) wall invalid, U to (1,6) obstacle invalid, R to (2,5) valid and food.\n> \n> So only R is possible. So for turn 4, action is R.\n> \n> Now, after that, turn 5: head at (2,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since dir R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite).\n> \n> Now, positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> After moving to (2,5) and eating, positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]? No: when head moves to (2,5), the segment that was at (1,5) moves to where head was? Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> Standard: the head moves to new cell. Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head was at P0, body at P1, tail at P2.\n> \n> After move, head to new position, say P_new, then body moves to P0, tail moves to P1.\n> \n> But if eating food, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> In this case: before move: head (1,5), body/tail (1,4) — since only two segments, (1,4) is both body and tail.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (1,5), index 1: tail (1,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,5), since eating food (positive), the snake grows, so the tail stays, and new positions: head at (2,5), then the previous head becomes body, so (1,5) is now body segment, and tail remains at (1,4) because it didn't move.\n> \n> So positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> Now, at turn 5, head at (2,5), direction is R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: to (2,6)\n> \n> - D: to (2,4)\n> \n> - R: to (3,5)\n> \n> - L: to (1,5) but (1,5) is current body, and L is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L anyway.\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n> \n> Now, possible cells:\n> \n> - U: (2,6) — y=6, not wall. Obstacles? Internal: (1,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so should be free. Walls: borders, x=2 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so ok.\n> \n> - D: (2,4) — y=4, not wall. But internal obstacle: (2,4) is listed as internal obstacle! Obstacles: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)], so (2,4) is obstacle, cannot go there.\n> \n> - R: (3,5) — x=3, y=5. Walls: x=3 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7. Obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (3,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - L: invalid because opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (2,6), or R to (3,5)\n> \n> Now, food: at (2,5) was eaten, so no food there anymore.

As above.\n> \n> Then positions: head moves to (2,6), no food there, so no grow, tail moves. Previous tail was at (1,4), but since no eat, tail moves to the previous body position? Movement: head to (2,6), body (1,5) moves to where head was, which is (2,5)? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move: positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> After move head to (2,6), no eat, so the body segments move: the segment that was at (1,5) moves to (2,5) (previous head position), and the tail at (1,4) moves to (1,5) (previous body position). So new positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), tail (1,5)\n> \n> Body is (2,5), which was the previous head position, and tail is (1,5), which was previous body.\n> \n> Now, (1,4) is now free.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,5): head to (3,5), no food there? Food at (4,3), (5,5), (4,5), not (3,5), so no eat. So head to (3,5), body (1,5) moves to (2,5), tail moves to (1,5)? Positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (1,5)? Previous: head (2,5), body (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> After head to (3,5): body moves to previous head (2,5), tail moves to previous body (1,5).

Walls: border y=7 is top, y=0 bottom. y=6 is not border, and (2,6) not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).

quickly while avoiding the unreachable (4,3) due to life span constraints.

No, when snake eats, it grows, so new head at (5,5), and the body follows, so the segment that was at (1,5) will be the tail, and since it grows, the tail doesn't move immediately? Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place for that turn. Then on next move, the tail moves.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the snake length increases by one, so positions become [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)] for this case, since head was (4,5), moves to (5,5) and eats, so new head at (5,5), and the body segments remain, with an additional segment, so the tail is still at (1,5), but now there are 5 segments.\n> \n> Initially: positions [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] head to tail.\n> \n> After moving R to (5,5) and eating: head is now at (5,5), and the previous positions are still there, but since it ate, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move. So positions become [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ].\n> \n> Then on the next turn, when I move, the head moves, and the tail moves forward, so the last segment (1,5) is removed if no growth, but since it grew, the tail stays for one extra turn? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail leaves the last cell.\n> \n> When snake eats, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> In this case: from state, move to (5,5), which has food, so eat: head now at (5,5), body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (1,5) remains, so new positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] with length 5.\n> \n> If I didn't eat, move to empty cell, head moves, tail moves, positions shift.\n> \n> Here, eating at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, is (5,5) safe?

I think it's better to think that at the start of turn t, if life_span > 0, it's present, and after being eaten or when life_span reaches 0, it's gone.\n> \n> But for planning, since we decide actions for turns, we need to know when it's available.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (5,4) with value 1 and life_span=9, so it has plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,5), direction R (right). So from (5,5), possible moves are U (up to (5,6)? y increases up? Let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U is y+1, that might mean y increases upwards, so (0,0) could be bottom-left or top-left? But walls are given: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so I think (0,0) is one corner, say bottom-left or top-left. But for movement, it doesn't matter as long as consistent.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — so if y+1 is up, then y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Or if y+1 is north, etc. But for planning, I can think in terms of coordinates.\n> \n> Current head at (5,5). Directions:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (5,6)\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (5,4)\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (4,5)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (6,5)\n> \n> But head direction is R, so last move was to the right. Now, no instant reverse, so I cannot move left (L) immediately, because that would be opposite to current direction R. Current direction is the direction the head is facing, which is the last move direction.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R? L is opposite, so cannot move L.\n> \n> Opposite of R is L, so cannot move L. Can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, check if these moves are valid, meaning not into wall or obstacle.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So:\n> \n> - U to (5,6): y=6, which is not y=7, so not wall. x=5 between 0 and 7, so ok.\n> \n> - D to (5,4): y=4, not 0, ok.\n> \n> - R to (6,5): x=6, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is not wall? x=7 is wall, so x=6 is within bounds. Grid from x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable? No.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,y) for any y, (7,y) for any y, (x,0) for any x, (x,7) for any x are walls.\n> \n> Therefore, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? Let's see.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are ok. Similarly y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are ok, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,5):\n> \n> - U: (5,6) — y=6, which is within 1 to 6, and not an obstacle. (5,6) not in obstacle list: obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (5,6) is not there, so ok.\n> \n> - D: (5,4) — y=4, x=5, not wall. Is it obstacle? (5,4) not in list, list has (2,4), (6,4), but (5,4) is different, so ok.\n> \n> - R: (6,5) — x=6, y=5. x=6 is not wall? x=6 is between 1 and 6, not x=7, so not wall. Obstacle? (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is not, so ok.\n> \n> - L: (4,5) — but cannot move L because opposite to current direction R.\n> \n> (4,5) is also where the body segment is. But let's see collision rules.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment. But there's an exception: you can move into the tail segment, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)] so head at (5,5), next segment at (4,5), which is the neck, then (3,5), (2,5), tail at (1,5).\n> \n> If I move left to (4,5), that is currently occupied by the body. But since it's the neck, and after move, the tail will move, so let's think what happens after move.\n> \n> After a move, the head moves to the new position, and if no food eaten, the tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> But if I move to a cell that is not the tail, it might be a body collision.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides.\n> \n> But if it moves to the tail cell, it's ok, because the tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,5): that is the position of the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (1,5). So (4,5) is the neck, which is part of the body, so moving there would cause collision, even if I could move left, which I can't because of direction.\n> \n> But since I cannot move left anyway, it's moot.\n> \n> Now, for other moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,6): is this cell occupied? Snake positions: all on y=5, x=1 to 5, so (5,6) is free, not occupied by snake. Not wall, not obstacle, so safe.\n> \n> - D to (5,4): similarly, free, not occupied, not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> - R to (6,5): free, not occupied, not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> All three moves are possible without immediate death.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, life_span 2. At turn 8, it has life_span 2, so it will be available on turn 8 and turn 9. After turn 9, it disappears, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n> \n> - (5,4): value 1, life_span 9, so available for many turns.\n> \n> (5,4) is directly below the head at (5,5), so D move would go to (5,4) and eat it, since it's positive food.\n> \n> If I move D to (5,4), I eat the food there, value +1, snake length increases to 6.\n> \n> But I need to consider the risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid for visualization.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls on borders and obstacles.\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) head.\n> \n> Food: (4,3) and (5,4)\n> \n> (4,3) is at x=4,y=3, which is below and left of head? Head at (5,5), so (4,3) is left and down.\n> \n> (5,4) is directly below, one step down.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (5,4), I eat the food immediately. Since it's positive, I grow, so after eating, the snake will have a new head at (5,4), and the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (5,4), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, so [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)] but since I ate, length increases, so tail stays, so segments: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) — that's 6 segments.\n> \n> Now, direction: after moving D, head direction becomes D.\n> \n> But is there any danger? (5,4) is not adjacent to tail or anything immediately dangerous.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,5), far away.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> There is also the food at (4,3) with short life span.\n> \n> If I eat (5,4) now, I might miss (4,3) if I can't reach it in time.\n> \n> (4,3) has life span 2, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n> \n> Turn 8: I move, if I don't eat it now, life span decreases to 1 after this turn? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 8, life span is 2. After turn 8, if not eaten, life span becomes 1 for turn 9. After turn 9, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> So I can eat it on turn 8 or turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,4), life span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (5,4) on turn 8, I eat it, grow to length 6.\n> \n> Then on turn 9, head at (5,4), direction D.\n> \n> From (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), but (5,5) is now the body, since after growing, (5,5) is the second segment.\n> \n> After eating at (5,4), positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n> \n> So if I move U to (5,5), that would be into the body segment, collision.\n> \n> Cannot move U.\n> \n> D to (5,3): y=3, within bounds, not wall.

It's turn 9, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead for long-term survival.\n> \n> The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with some internal blocks.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then body segments at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and (1,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since (x,y) and D is (x,y-1).\n> \n> Food: there's one food at (4,3) with value 1 and life span 1. That means it will disappear after this turn, since life span decreases every turn including current, and it's 1 now, so if not eaten this turn, it vanishes.\n> \n> Food life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for life span 1, if it's not eaten on turn 9, it will be gone by turn 10. Since we're on turn 9, we can eat it now to get it before it disappears.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (5,4), and food is at (4,3). Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But current head direction is D, so I cannot do an instant reverse to U next turn because of the no instant reverse rule. Since I moved down to get to (5,4), I can't go up immediately; that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning the last move was down to reach (5,4). So from (5,5) to (5,4) by moving down. Therefore, on the next move, I cannot move up (U) because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Allowed moves: from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5), but (5,5) is the second segment of the snake body. Moving there would cause a collision unless it's the tail and we're moving such that the tail moves away.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). So (5,5) is the segment right behind the head.\n> \n> If I move up to (5,5), that's directly into the body, which would cause a collision and death, because it's not the tail; the tail is at (1,5). Only moving to the tail cell might be safe if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except when it's the tail and we're moving in a way that the tail moves, so it doesn't occupy that cell anymore.\n> \n> General rule: if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it's collision, except for the tail segment if the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,5): currently, (5,5) has a body segment. After moving the head to (5,5), the body segments shift: the old head becomes new neck, etc., and the tail moves away if we grow or not.\n> \n> When we move, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. If we don't eat food, the tail segment is removed, so the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and I don't eat food, then after moving, the tail moves away, so that cell is free, and no collision. But if I move to a cell that is occupied by a non-tail body segment, that segment will still be there after the move, so collision.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If moving to a cell that is not occupied by any body segment, safe.\n> \n> - If moving to a cell occupied by the tail segment, and we do not eat food, then after move, tail moves away, so safe.\n> \n> - If moving to a cell occupied by the tail segment and we eat food (if food is there), then the tail doesn't move away; instead, we grow, so the head and the new tail occupy adjacent cells, but if it was the tail, and we eat food there, it's dangerous because of tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, for moving to a cell.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up (U) to (5,5): this cell is occupied by the first body segment. After move, if I go to (5,5), the head moves there, and the body segments shift: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to (5,4) or something. Let's simulate:\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n> \n> If I move U to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head position: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then the body: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where the head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (5,5) becomes the neck, so it stays? No.\n> \n> Positions before move: index 0: head (5,4), index 1: (5,5), index 2: (4,5), etc.\n> \n> After move to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then new body: the old head (5,4) becomes new index 1 (neck), old index 1 (5,5) was at (5,5), but since head moved to (5,5), that cell is now head, and old index 1 must move to where? It moves to the position of the segment it was following, which was index 0, but index 0 is now at (5,5), so old index 1 moves to (5,4)? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it in the previous state.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> - Segment 0: (5,4) head\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (1,5) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old segment 0, which was (5,4), so (5,4)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1, which was (5,5), but (5,5) is now head, so it moves to where? The body segments shift: segment 1 moves to the position that segment 0 was, which is (5,4), but (5,4) is now occupied by new segment 1.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions:\n> \n> The head moves to (5,5).\n> \n> Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Segment 1 (which was at (5,5)) moves to the position of segment 0 before move, which was (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (at (4,5)) moves to the position of segment 1 before move, which was (5,5)\n> \n> - But (5,5) is now head, so segment 2 moves to (5,5)? That would be collision.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: when the head moves to a new cell, the neck (first body segment) moves to the old head position, and so on.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - New head at (5,5)\n> \n> - New position for segment 1: the old head position (5,4)\n> \n> - New position for segment 2: the old position of segment 1, which was (5,5)\n> \n> But (5,5) is now the head, so segment 2 would be moving to (5,5), which is occupied by the head, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's a collision because the head and segment 2 both want to be at (5,5), but segment 2 is moving to where the head is.\n> \n> In terms of the grid after move:\n> \n> - Cell (5,5) has the new head.\n> \n> - When segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, which was (5,5), but (5,5) is now occupied, so it collides.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to a cell that is occupied by a body segment other than the tail is always deadly, because that segment doesn't move away; it shifts to a new position but the cell is taken by head.\n> \n> Except for the tail: if you move to the tail position, and you don't eat food, then the tail moves away, so it's safe.\n> \n> But if you eat food, you grow, so tail stays, and you collide with the new segment.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by segment 1, not the tail. Tail is at (1,5). So moving to (5,5) would cause collision with segment 1, since it will be moving to or occupying that cell.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, head is at (5,5), segment 1 moves to (5,4), segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, which was (5,5), but (5,5) is head, so segment 2 cannot move there; collision.\n> \n> So, moving to (5,5) is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,4), moving up to (5,5) is not possible; it's a body collision.\n> \n> Now, down: D to (5,3). Is (5,3) within bounds? Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since borders at x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls.\n> \n> x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> (5,3): x=5, y=3, which is within 1 to 6, so possible. Is it a wall? No walls at (5,3), internal obstacles are at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Also, no food or body there? Body positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc., all at y=4 or 5, so (5,3) should be empty.\n> \n> So moving down to (5,3) is possible.\n> \n> Left: L to (4,4). (4,4): x=4,y=4. Within bounds? x=4 between 1-6, y=4 between 1-6. Not a wall: obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (4,4) not listed, so free. Is it occupied? Snake is at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc., so (4,4) not occupied, no food mentioned, so empty. So L to (4,4) possible.\n> \n> Right: R to (6,4). (6,4): x=6,y=4. Within bounds? x=6 is ok, y=4 ok. But internal obstacles: (6,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacles include (6,4), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So R to (6,4) is not possible; wall collision.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (5,4) with head direction D:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5) - body collision, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (5,3) - possible\n> \n> - L: to (4,4) - possible\n> \n> - R: to (6,4) - wall, invalid\n> \n> Also, cannot do instant reverse, but U is opposite to D, so even if it were free, I couldn't do it, but it's not free anyway.\n> \n> So only possible actions: D or L.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) with life span 1.

It's turn 10. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). Snake positions: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is down, meaning it was moving down to (5,3) from (5,4)? Let's see: positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). Since head is at (5,3) and previous was (5,4), that means it just moved down to (5,3), so current direction is D (down).\n> \n> Now, food: only one food item at (4,6) with value 1 and life span 10. Since current turn is 10, and life span decreases every turn including current, this food will disappear after turn 10 + 10 - 1? Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, a food with life span L will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> It says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for a food spawned at turn S with life span N, it exists from turn S to turn S + N - 1, and disappears at turn S + N. But here, it's given at current turn, so for food at (4,6), it has life span 10 at turn 10. That means it was spawned at some turn, but we don't know when. The life span is the remaining life at current turn. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at current turn t, life_span is the number of turns it will still exist, including the current turn. So for this food, at turn 10, life_span=10, meaning it will disappear after turn 10 + 10 - 1 = turn 19? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns from now. \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N more turns, so it exists for this turn and N-1 more turns.\n> \n> For example, if life_span=1 at turn t, it exists only at turn t, disappears after turn t.\n> \n> If life_span=2, exists at turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> So generally, with life_span L at turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> So for this food, at turn 10, life_span=10, so it exists from turn 10 to turn 19, and disappears at turn 20.\n> \n> But we're at turn 10, so it has 10 turns left including this one.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> Food at (4,6) with value +1.\n> \n> Head direction is D (down), meaning it just moved down to (5,3) from (5,4)? Positions: from head to tail: (5,3) <- head, then (5,4), which is above it, so yes, it moved down to (5,3), so current direction is down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,3): can go up, down, left, right, but considering no instant reverse and collisions.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so cannot go up (opposite direction) on next turn. So reverse is up, which is not allowed.\n> \n> Possible moves: down, left, right. Up is reverse, so invalid.\n> \n> Down to (5,2)? (5,2) is within bounds? y=2, x=5, but walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is fine, x=5 fine. Check if cell is free.\n> \n> (5,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So (5,2) is not in snake, not an obstacle? Obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (5,2) is free? But walls: borders are walls, so (5,2) is not border, x=5 between 1-6? x from 0 to 7, 0 and 7 walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. So valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? For example, (1,1) is an internal obstacle, not border, so (1,1) is a cell but occupied by obstacle.\n> \n> Generally, all cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6 are playable except where obstacles are.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so not accessible. Similarly y=0 and y=7 not accessible. So accessible area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) is at corner, but it's listed as internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6), (6,4), etc.\n> \n> So (5,2): x=5, y=2, which is within 1-6, and not in obstacles list, and not occupied by snake, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (4,3): x=4, y=3, free? Snake: (5,3) head, (5,4), etc., so (4,3) not in snake positions. Obstacles: (3,1) but not (4,3), so free.\n> \n> Right to (6,3): x=6, y=3, not in snake, not obstacle? Obstacles include (6,4), but (6,3) is different, so free.\n> \n> But (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,3) should be ok.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (4,6).\n> \n> I need to think about getting to the food or not, considering risks.\n> \n> First, let's see the distance to food.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), food at (4,6). So Δx = -1, Δy = +3, so Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n> \n> But with obstacles, it might not be direct.\n> \n> Now, possible actions this turn: since cannot go up (reverse), can go down, left, right.\n> \n> If I go down to (5,2), that moves away from food.\n> \n> Left to (4,3) is closer to food in x, same y.\n> \n> Right to (6,3) farther in x.\n> \n> But food is at (4,6), so left might be better, but need to plan path.\n> \n> Also, need to think about the tail and potential collisions.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5), which is not near head right now.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), tail at (2,5), so not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, about the food: it's at (4,6), which is not under snake body, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (2,5), not near (4,6), and no food there, so not an issue now.\n> \n> First, I need to consider moving towards the food or not.\n> \n> But the food has life span 10, so it will be there until turn 19, we have time, but we need to survive and eat it or other foods, but there might be only this one for now.\n> \n> The state only shows this food, so I think for now, we assume only this food is present.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should eat positive food when possible, but avoid risks.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout to find safe paths.\n> \n> List all occupied cells:\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> So free cells: all (x,y) for x=1-6, y=1-6 except above.\n> \n> For example, row y=1: x=1 to 6 except (1,1) obstacle and (3,1) obstacle, so (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) free?

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and moving to any of these border coordinates is a wall collision. Also, internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (4,3), then body segments at (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So the snake has 6 segments: head at (4,3), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> - Snake head direction: Currently moving Left (L), so from (4,3) it was moving left to (4,3)? No, the positions show the head at (4,3), and it was moving left to get there, I think. Head direction is L, meaning it just moved left to (4,3) from some previous position. But since positions are given as [(4,3), (5,3), ...], the head is at (4,3), and it came from (5,3) since (5,3) is the next segment. So moving left to (4,3) from (5,3).\n> \n> - Food: Only one food item given: (4,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Life span 9 means it disappears after 9 turns, including this one, so it will disappear on turn 11 + 9 = 20? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 11, life span is 9, then turn 12 it will be 8, and so on, until turn 20 it will be 0 and disappear. But since it's eaten when head moves onto it, as long as we eat it by turn 19, it should be fine. Turn 11: life span 9, after turn 11 it decreases to 8, so after k turns, life span is 9 - k, and it disappears when life span reaches 0, which is after 9 decreases. So from turn 11 to turn 19, life span from 9 to 1, and on turn 20 it disappears. But we can eat it on turn 19 when life span is 1, and it will be gone. Eating happens when head moves to the food cell.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 11.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

(4,5) is a body segment, and (4,6) is food.\n> \n> (4,5) is a body segment, (4,6) is above it, so not occupied by snake currently.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it just moved left to (4,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (4,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,3)\n> \n> But we have constraints:\n> \n> - Cannot move into walls or obstacles.\n> \n> - Cannot move into body segments, except the tail, because when we move, the tail also moves.\n> \n> Body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> From (4,3), moving:\n> \n> - U to (4,4): is (4,4) occupied? Snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So (4,4) is not in the list, so it's free? Let's list all occupied cells: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So (4,4) is empty, not occupied by snake.\n> \n> But is there a wall or obstacle? (4,4) is within bounds, x=4 between 0-7, y=4 between 0-7. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) — none at (4,4), so (4,4) is free.\n> \n> - D to (4,2): (4,2) — not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Borders: y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is fine. Obstacles no at (4,2), so free.\n> \n> - L to (3,3): (3,3) — not in snake positions? Snake has (3,5) and (4,3), etc., but (3,3) not listed. Also, not wall or obstacle. Obstacles at (3,1), but (3,3) is different. So free.\n> \n> - R to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied by the second body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision, as head touches body. The tail is at (3,5), so (5,3) is a body segment, not tail. Therefore, moving right to (5,3) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, which is not allowed. Current head direction is L, meaning it was moving left, so moving right (opposite) is forbidden.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L. R is invalid because it's reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> Now, food is at (4,6), which is two cells up from head? Head at (4,3), so (4,4) then (4,5) then (4,6)? (4,5) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> (4,5) is a body segment, so to eat food at (4,6), we need to move head to (4,6), but (4,5) is currently occupied. According to rules, food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, food at (4,6) is not under snake, since (4,6) is free, I think. Snake positions don't include (4,6), so it's accessible.\n> \n> But to reach (4,6) from (4,3), we need to go up.\n> \n> But (4,4) is free, (4,5) is occupied by snake body, (4,6) is food.\n> \n> If we move up to (4,4), then from there to (4,5), but (4,5) is currently occupied, but when we move, the snake moves, so if we move up to (4,4), the head moves to (4,4), and the body follows: the tail at (3,5) will move away? Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> On turn 11, we choose an action.\n> \n> Suppose we move U to (4,4).\n> \n> Then new positions: head moves to (4,4), and the body segments shift: the segment that was at (5,3) moves to where head was, (4,3)? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So current positions: [ (4,3) head, (5,3) seg1, (5,4) seg2, (5,5) seg3, (4,5) seg4, (3,5) seg5 tail ]\n> \n> After moving U to (4,4):\n> \n> New head position: (4,4)\n> \n> Then seg1 moves to old head position (4,3)\n> \n> seg2 moves to old seg1 position (5,3)\n> \n> seg3 moves to old seg2 position (5,4)\n> \n> seg4 moves to old seg3 position (5,5)\n> \n> seg5 (tail) moves to old seg4 position (4,5)\n> \n> So new snake: [ (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] and tail at (4,5), but (4,5) was seg4, now seg5 is at (4,5), and the old tail seg5 at (3,5) is gone, so tail is now at (4,5).\n> \n> Positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,6) is still there.

I need to check the movement: U is (x,y+1), which might mean y increases upwards or downwards? The movement says U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), so if y+1 is up, then higher y is up. But in many systems, y=0 is top, but here it says y=0 is a border, so likely y=0 is bottom or top? Let's see the borders: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake is at (4,4), and head direction U, so moving to (x,y+1), which should be (4,5) if y increases up, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Head is (4,4), next is (4,3), which is below if y=3 < y=4, so if y increases upwards, then (4,3) is south of head.

So the second segment is (4,3), which is directly below head if y increases upwards. Then (5,3), which is east and same y, so right if x increases right. Then (5,4), which is north of (5,3) if y=4>y=3, so up. Then (5,5), up from (5,4)? (5,4) to (5,5) is up if y increases up.

But only if it's the tail; other body parts would cause collision.\n> \n> Here, (4,5) is the tail, so moving to (4,5) should be safe because after movement, the tail moves forward, so head goes to (4,5), and tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> But let's confirm the movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed from old position.\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,5), which is current tail position, after move: head is at (4,5), then body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (5,5) is now the new tail? Let's see: original positions: head (4,4), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (5,3), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (5,5), tail (4,5).\n> \n> After moving head U to (4,5): new head at (4,5), then the segments: seg1 becomes (4,4), seg2 becomes (4,3), seg3 becomes (5,3), seg4 becomes (5,4), seg5 becomes (5,5). And the old tail at (4,5) is now head, so the new body is from (4,4) to (5,5), with tail at (5,5). So no collision, since head moved to where tail was, and tail moved away.\n> \n> Now, food: there's one food at (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8. Life span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 12, life span 8, it will disappear after turn 12 + 8 - 1? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now? Example: at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten for N turns, from t to t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> Here, turn 12, food at (4,6) with life span 8, so it will be available until turn 12 + 8 - 1 = turn 19? Let's calculate: at turn 12, life span 8, so after turn 12, life span becomes 7 (if we think after state update), but the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at the start of turn 12, life span is 8, after turn 12 is processed, it decreases to 7, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when life span >0.\n> \n> It can be eaten on turn t if life span at start of turn >0, and after eating, it's removed.\n> \n> But in terms of disappearance: after N turns from current, it disappears. At turn t, life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> Standard way: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, L decreases by 1. When L reaches 0, after the decrease, it disappears, so it can be eaten only when L >=1, and after eaten or L=0, it's gone.\n> \n> For this food, at turn 12, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 12 to turn 19? Let's think:\n> \n> - Start turn 12: L=8\n> \n> - After turn 12: if not eaten, L=7\n> \n> - After turn 13: L=6, and so on, down to after turn 19: L=0, so it disappears before turn 20 or after turn 19?\n> \n> After processing turn t, life span decreases. So after turn t, if L was >0, it decreases; if L=1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food to be eatable on turn t, L at start of turn must be at least 1.\n> \n> This food has L=8 at turn 12, so it can be eaten on turns 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. After turn 19, L=0, gone.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (4,6). Head is at (4,4), and if it moves U, it goes to (4,5), which is not food, food is at (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) is one cell above (4,5). So from head (4,4), moving U to (4,5) is possible, but (4,5) is currently tail, but as we said, it's safe.\n> \n> Then from (4,5), it can move U to (4,6) to eat food.\n> \n> But let's see the rules: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (4,6), not on the tail. Tail is at (4,5), no food there.\n> \n> Food is at (4,6), separate cell.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,4)\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction is U, so I cannot move opposite, which is D, immediately.

So if head moves to (4,5), it would be colliding with the body segment at (4,5), which is not the tail. So that should be a collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to a cell where a body segment is, it dies, unless it's the tail and we're moving to it just as the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is (5,5). So moving to (4,5) should cause collision.\n> \n> Let's list current snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (4,6) head\n> \n> Index 1: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 3: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 4: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 5: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 6: (5,5) tail\n> \n> So positions occupied: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> From head (4,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (4,7) — but y=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: to (4,5) — but (4,5) is occupied by body segment, and it's not the tail, so collision, invalid\n> \n> - Left: to (3,6) — let's check if valid\n> \n> - Right: to (5,6) — similarly\n> \n> Now, (3,6): is it a wall? Borders: x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7. (3,6) has x=3, y=6, both within 0-7, not border. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) is not listed, so free. No body there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6): x=5,y=6, not border, not in obstacles list, free.\n> \n> Also, (4,5) is occupied, but as we said, invalid for down.\n> \n> But what about (4,5)? If I move down to (4,5), it's body, collision.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at (5,5), so if I move to (5,5), that might be okay, but from (4,6) to (5,5) is diagonal, not possible; moves are only U/D/L/R, so to (5,5) would require moving right then down or something, but not directly.\n> \n> From (4,6), I can only move to adjacent cells: (4,7) U, (4,5) D, (3,6) L, (5,6) R.\n> \n> U to (4,7): wall, invalid\n> \n> D to (4,5): occupied by body, not tail, collision, invalid\n> \n> L to (3,6): free, should be ok\n> \n> R to (5,6): free, ok\n> \n> So possible moves from current position: Left to (3,6) or Right to (5,6)\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food. Food is at (2,3) with value +1, life span 9, so it will disappear after turn 14+9-1? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life span 9, decreases every turn including current. So on turn 14, it has life span 9, meaning it will be there for 9 turns, from turn 14 to turn 22? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn 14, life_span=9, after turn 14, it becomes 8, and so on, until turn 14+9-1=22? After 9 turns, on turn 23 it disappears? Example: on turn t, life_span=N, then after turn t, it becomes N-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So food at (2,3) with life_span=9 on turn 14:\n> \n> - After turn 14, life_span=8\n> \n> - After turn 15, life_span=7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 22, life_span=0, so it disappears before turn 23? Or after the turn it becomes 0.\n> \n> Typically, it should be present until the end of the turn when life_span decreases to 0. But for planning, it's available until turn 14 + 9 - 1 = 22? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span N. During turn t, it can be eaten. After turn t, life_span decreases to N-1. So if N=1 on turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and after turn t, it becomes 0 and disappears, so not available for turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, here life_span=9 on turn 14, so it can be eaten on turns 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. After turn 22, it disappears, so not on turn 23.\n> \n> It is available from turn 14 to turn 22 inclusive, that's 9 turns: 14 to 22 is 9 turns? 22-14+1=9, yes.\n> \n> Now, I need to get to (2,3) to eat it, but it might not be safe immediately.\n> \n> First, let's see the path to (2,3) from head (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) to (2,3): delta x = -2, delta y = -3, so need to go left and down.\n> \n> But with obstacles and walls.\n> \n> Also, snake body is in the way.\n> \n> Now, current possible moves: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6)\n> \n> If I go left to (3,6), then from there, I can go to (2,6), (3,5), (4,6) but (4,6) is previous, or (3,7) but y=7 wall, so U invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go right to (5,6), then to (6,6), (5,5), etc.\n> \n> But (5,5) is tail, so moving to (5,5) might be ok if tail moves.\n> \n> But let's think step by step.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks, like dead ends or getting trapped.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid with obstacles and snake.\n> \n> I'll make a grid representation mentally.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. But since borders, it's the cells.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,6) is obstacle, which is near.\n> \n> Now snake positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> So cells occupied by snake: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> Food at (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is currently occupied by snake body?

The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Here, food at (2,3) is not under snake body, since snake is at (4,3) and (5,3), not (2,3), so it's free to eat when head moves there.\n> \n> (2,3) is empty now.\n> \n> Now, to reach (2,3) from (4,6), I need to go left and down.\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> But first, I must choose a move for turn 14.\n> \n> Options: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6)\n> \n> If I go left to (3,6), then from there, I can go to (2,6), (3,5), or (4,6) but (4,6) will be body after move, so not back.\n> \n> (2,6): x=2,y=6, not border, obstacles: (1,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are (1,6), so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> (3,5): free.\n> \n> (3,7) wall.\n> \n> So from (3,6), can go U (invalid), D to (3,5), L to (2,6), R to (4,6) which will be body.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6), the snake will be at positions: head to (3,6), then the body: since head moves to (3,6), the tail (5,5) will move?

Also, R is opposite to current L, so invalid move anyway.\n> \n> Current direction L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> U: (3,7) is y=7, border wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (3,5) — let's confirm: grid cells, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, borders are walls. (3,5): not border, not in obstacle list: obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (3,5) clear. Snake body: positions are as above, (3,5) not occupied. So D to (3,5) is possible.\n> \n> L: (2,6) — x=2,y=6, not border, not obstacle (obstacles: (1,6) but (2,6) not listed), snake body: (2,6) not in positions, so should be free.\n> \n> But (1,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) is different cell.\n> \n> So possible actions: D or L.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 15, life span 8, then turn 16 it becomes 7, ..., down to 0 on turn 22? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

It's turn 16, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (3,5) to... the positions are given in order, so from head to tail: (3,5) is head, then (3,6) is the next segment. If head is at (3,5) and direction is down, but (3,6) is above? Let's plot this.\n> \n> Coordinates: y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in programming, sometimes y=0 is top. But here, since head direction is down and position (3,5) to (3,6), if y increases upwards, (3,6) would be north of (3,5), so if head is moving down to (3,5), it should have come from (3,6)? I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Head is at (3,5), and it was moving down to get there.

So before that, it was at (3,6), I think? But (3,6) is now occupied by segment 2.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment follows the previous position. So at turn t, head is at (3,5), which it moved to from previous position.\n> \n> Previous head position: since it moved down to (3,5), it came from (3,6), which is now the second segment.\n> \n> Then the positions: after head moved to (3,5), the body segments are at the previous positions: (3,6) was head, now segment 2; (4,6) was segment 2, now segment 3; (4,5) was segment 3, now segment 4; (4,4) was segment 4, now segment 5; (4,3) was segment 5, now segment 6; (5,3) was segment 6, now tail.\n> \n> And tail was at (5,3) before, but since the snake moved, the tail moves forward, so (5,3) is the current tail.\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,5). So from (3,6) to (3,5).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,3), life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 16, so for (2,3), it will disappear after turn 16 + 7 - 1? Let's see: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now, meaning on turn t + N it is gone, so it can be eaten from turn t to t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, if life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Here, life span 7 at turn 16, so it will be available until turn 16 + 6 = 22? Turn 16: life span 7, so after turn 16, life span becomes 6, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 16 to 22 inclusive? Let's calculate:\n> \n> At turn 16: life span 7, countdown starts, after turn 16, it decreases to 6.\n> \n> After turn 17: 5, ..., after turn 22: 0, so on turn 23 it disappears. So it is present from turn 16 to 22.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,5): life span 10, present from turn 16 to 25.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 16 onwards.\n> \n> First, I need to find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but with constraints.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction.

But if it moves to the tail cell, and the tail moves away, it's ok, because the snake grows only after eating food, but when moving, if it doesn't eat, tail moves, so head can move to where tail was, and tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, since no food is eaten yet, moving to tail position is safe if tail moves.\n> \n> Now, let's list all occupied cells by snake and walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So forbidden cells: walls and snake body except tail can be occupied only if tail moves.\n> \n> For movement, from (3,5), possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) - but (3,6) is occupied by segment 2, which is body, not tail.

No, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and new segment added?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it occupies that cell, and the tail does not advance, so the snake length increases by one.

It's turn 17. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). These are walls I must avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,4), then body segments at (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it's moving downward. Since it's moving down, the next position would be y decreasing, so from (3,4) down would be to (3,3), but I need to check if that's valid.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1 each.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.

Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake: positions: (3,4) head, (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3).

Current head is at (3,4), direction D, meaning it just moved down to (3,4) from, say, previous position. Snake positions are given in order: head first, so [(3,4), (3,5), ...] so from (3,4) to (3,5) to (3,6) etc., but if head is at (3,4) and moving down, that means it came from above, like (3,5) or something? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The positions are listed: index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (3,5), index 2: (3,6), index 3: (4,6), index 4: (4,5), index 5: (4,4), index 6: (4,3).\n> \n> Since head direction is D (down), and head is at (3,4), that means on the previous move, it moved down to (3,4). So before that, head was at (3,5) or something? Positions: if head is at (3,4) and next segment is (3,5), that means the snake was moving upward, because from (3,5) to (3,4) is down? I'm getting confused.\n> \n> Standard: positions list: [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail]\n> \n> So head at (3,4), segment1 at (3,5) — that means segment1 is directly behind the head. If the snake is moving down, from (x,y) to (x,y-1), but here head is at (3,4), segment1 at (3,5), which is above it, so y=5 > y=4, so if head is at (3,4) and segment at (3,5), that means the head moved down to (3,4) from (3,5), but (3,5) is now the first body segment. That makes sense: the snake was at (3,5) and moved down to (3,4), so now (3,4) is head, and (3,5) is the first body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, then (3,6) is next, then (4,6), etc.\n> \n> So current direction is down, so from (3,4), moving down would go to (3,3), but let's see what's at (3,3).\n> \n> Available moves: from head (3,4), I can move U (up, to (3,5)), D (down, to (3,3)), L (left, to (2,4)), R (right, to (4,4)).\n> \n> But I have movement constraints: no instant reverse. Current direction is D (down), so I cannot move up (U) immediately, because that would be opposite direction. So U is invalid for next move.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid walls and body.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: (3,5) — but this is occupied by the first body segment. Moving into body is deadly, so I cannot move to (3,5) because it's part of the snake body. The snake body includes (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). (4,4) is a body segment, and (3,5) is body.\n> \n> Also, walls: let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> For collision: head touches any body segment except the tail in some cases, but generally, if I move to a cell with body, it's collision unless it's the tail and I'm eating food or something, but in this case, for movement, if the cell has a body part, it's deadly.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the cell is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it's collision. If it's the tail, and I move there, it might be ok if the tail moves away, but only if I'm not eating food there or something. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But there's a special case for food under body.\n> \n> In this position, from (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,5) — this is a body segment (first segment after head), so it's not tail, so collision if I move there.

It's turn 18, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but there are internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). I should note these as blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,3), and the body segments are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it's moving towards decreasing y, I assume? Let me confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). But in grid terms, usually y increases upwards, but here U is y+1, which might imply y increases as we go up? Let's see: U: (x,y+1) – so if y increases upwards, U would be up. Similarly, D: (x,y-1) would be down. L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right. Yes.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,3), and moving down, so from (3,3) to (3,4)? Positions are given as list: index 0 is head: (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4). Since head direction is D, and it's at (3,3), moving down would be to (3,2), but (3,2) isn't listed yet; it's the next move. Current positions are where the snake is now.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order: head (3,3), then next segment (3,4), which is above it? (3,3) and (3,4) – if y increases upwards, (3,4) is above (3,3), but head direction is D, down, which is decreasing y. So from previous position, if it was moving down, it came from (3,4) to (3,3)? That might be inconsistent.\n> \n> Perhaps I should think of the positions in sequence. Snake positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]. So head is at (3,3), and the tail is at (4,4). Since head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,3). Before this, head was at (3,4), and it moved down to (3,3). (3,4) is now the neck. From the list, position 0: (3,3) head, position 1: (3,4), position 2: (3,5), etc. So when head was at (3,4), it moved down to (3,3), so direction is D.\n> \n> Now, for the next move, from (3,3), it can move to adjacent cells, but with constraints.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 5. Life span decreases every turn, including current turn 18, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning on turn 23 it will be gone? Life span decreases each turn, so if life span is 5 at turn 18, after turn 18 it becomes 4, turn 19:3, turn 20:2, turn 21:1, turn 22:0, so it disappears after turn 22, or at the end of turn 22? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 18, life span 5, after turn 18 it's 4, so it should be present until the start of turn when life span becomes 0. I think it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5) value 1, life span 8, so it has more time.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 18 and beyond, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - Walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7\n> \n> - Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) is corner, but since walls are separate, (1,1) might be playable? Walls are at borders, so (1,1) is inside but has obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - Snake body: (3,3) head, but head is not body for collision? Collision is head touching any body segment except tail in some cases.\n> \n> Rule: body collision (head touches any body segment), but when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,4), and when snake moves, tail will move to the next position.\n> \n> Also, food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on it.\n> \n> Now, current food: (2,3) and (1,5)\n> \n> (2,3) is adjacent to head? Head at (3,3), so (2,3) is left of head, L direction.\n> \n> (1,5) is at x=1,y=5.\n> \n> Possible moves from head position (3,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): (x,y+1) = (3,4) – but (3,4) is occupied by the snake body (second segment). So if I move up to (3,4), that's where the neck is, so head would collide with body immediately. Since it's not the tail, it's a body segment, so collision, death. Cannot move up.\n> \n> - Down (D): (x,y-1) = (3,2) – is this within bounds? y=2, x=3. y=1 to 6, so y=2 is valid. Is there wall or obstacle? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is fine. Obstacles: (3,1) is at y=1, not y=2. (3,2) should be free, I think. Let me list all blocked cells.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> - Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 – all cells on these lines.\n> \n> - Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> - Snake body: except the head, but head is current position, so for next move, the cells occupied by body segments are obstacles unless it's the tail and we can move there.\n> \n> For movement options, we consider which cells are safe to move to.\n> \n> From (3,3):\n> \n> - U: (3,4) – occupied by snake body (segment 1), so not free, collision.\n> \n> - D: (3,2) – let's check: x=3,y=2. Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles are (3,1), etc.), and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4). So (3,2) is not in list, so free? But is it within bounds? y=2, between 1 and 6, yes. So (3,2) seems free.\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (2,3) – x=2,y=3. Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different), and not in snake positions? Snake: (3,3), etc., (2,3) not listed, but there is food at (2,3), but food is not obstacle, snake can move to food cell to eat it. So (2,3) is free for movement, with food.\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (4,3) – x=4,y=3. Not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake has (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), but not (4,3), so free.\n> \n> (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Since we cannot move opposite on next turn, so U is not allowed anyway, because it would be reverse. Current direction D, so cannot move U immediately.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn, meaning for turn 18, since head direction is D, I cannot choose U for this move.\n> \n> So possible actions for turn 18:\n> \n> - U: invalid, because reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> - D: to (3,2)\n> \n> - L: to (2,3)\n> \n> - R: to (4,3)\n> \n> All seem possible except U.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and risks.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) with life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 22? At turn 18, life span 5, decreases each turn, so after 5 turns, at turn 23 it should be gone? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 18: life span 5\n> \n> After turn 18, life span 4 (before turn 19)\n> \n> Turn 19: life span 3\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 22: life span 0, so it disappears, not available on turn 22 or after.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 8, so longer.\n> \n> Now, (2,3) is adjacent, I can eat it by moving left.\n> \n> But I need to consider the tail and body.\n> \n> If I move to (2,3), I eat the food, snake length increases by 1, so new head at (2,3), and the tail doesn't move yet? When you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the head position, but since head moves, the body extends.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the tail doesn't advance, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> Head at (3,3), tail at (4,4), distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, I think?

So no immediate danger.\n> \n> If I move to (2,3), I eat food, snake grows to length 8, new head at (2,3), body: (3,3) becomes new segment 1, then (3,4), etc., and tail still at (4,4) for now? When head moves to (2,3), since it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4) — tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Then next turn, when snake moves, tail will move depending on direction.\n> \n> But for now, eating (2,3) seems possible.\n> \n> I could move down to (3,2) or right to (4,3).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, the food at (1,5) is available.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the board state.\n> \n> Grid:\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> - Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> - Also walls at borders, but not inside.\n> \n> Snake: positions (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Row y=6: (1,6) obstacle, (3,6) snake, (4,6) snake\n> \n> y=5: (3,5) snake, (4,5) snake\n> \n> y=4: (3,4) snake, (4,4) snake, and (2,4) obstacle\n> \n> y=3: (3,3) snake head, and (2,3) food\n> \n> y=2: (3,2) free?

Main Thinking Conclusion\n> \n> Prioritized eating the positive food at (1,5) due to its shorter life span (7 turns) by moving left and up immediately, securing the +1 score while avoiding the risk of missing it; this also maintains a shorter snake length (8 segments) for better maneuverability in the confined top-left area, ensuring long-term survival by not growing prematurely from (2,2) and reducing collision risks.\n",

It's turn 20, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (1,3), then body segments at (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), and tail at (4,5). So the snake has 8 segments. The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (1,3) from (2,3) in the previous move.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - One at (1,5) with value 1 and life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, so by turn 26.\n> - Another at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 9, disappearing after turn 29.\n> \n> Both foods are positive since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Priority is long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize. Grid is 8x8, coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> - Head: (1,3)\n> - Body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)  // tail is (4,5)\n> \n> Head direction: L, so it just moved left to (1,3).\n> \n> Available moves from current head position (1,3):\n> - Up (U): (1,4)\n> - Down (D): (1,2)\n> - Left (L): (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> - Right (R): (2,3) but (2,3) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> (2,3) is the first body segment, so moving right would cause a collision because the head would hit the body at (2,3). But according to the rules, I can move into the tail cell if the tail moves away. Let's see the tail position.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,5). When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if I move right to (2,3), which is currently occupied, but since it's not the tail, and the tail is at (4,5), moving to (2,3) would collide with the body segment that is not the tail. The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment other than the tail causes collision. Only the tail cell is safe to move into because the tail moves.\n> \n> From (1,3):\n> - U: (1,4) – is this free? Let's see what's there. Snake positions: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc. (1,4) is not in the snake list, and not a wall? Walls: internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,4) is not listed as obstacle, and not border since y=4 is not border. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,4) should be free.\n> \n> - D: (1,2) – not in snake positions, not wall? (1,2) not listed, should be free.\n> \n> - L: (0,3) – x=0 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (2,3) – this is occupied by the snake body (second segment), so moving there would cause collision unless it's the tail. But (2,3) is not the tail; tail is (4,5). So moving right to (2,3) is invalid due to body collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from current position (1,3) with head direction L, possible moves are only Up or Down.\n> \n> Now, since head direction is L, moving opposite would be R, but R is invalid anyway, so no issue with instant reverse.\n> \n> So actions for turn 20: I can choose U or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead to eat food and avoid risks.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> - (1,5) with life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 26.\n> - (2,2) with life span 9, by turn 29.\n> \n> Also, the grid has obstacles, so I need to be careful.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving Up to (1,4).\n> \n> From (1,4), possible moves:\n> - U: (1,5) – which has food! (1,5) is a food position.\n> - D: (1,3) – but (1,3) is where the snake body is now, but after moving to (1,4), the snake will have moved, so positions will shift.\n> \n> I need to simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current snake positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n> \n> If I move Up to (1,4), the head moves to (1,4), and the tail moves away from (4,5) to the next segment, but since no food eaten, length doesn't change, so tail moves to (4,6)? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So after moving U to (1,4):\n> - New head: (1,4)\n> - Then body: (1,3) [was head], (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) – and tail (4,5) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> Positions: head was (1,3), after move: head at (1,4), then the first body segment is the old head position (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), and (4,6).

It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7, so the snake can only be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? But there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So walls are all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and also (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake has 8 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y, I assume. In coordinates, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,5), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So at turn 21, life span is 5, so it will disappear after 5 more turns? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L turns, including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So, for example, at turn t, life span N, after one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears. So at turn t, with life span N, it will be present for N more turns, disappearing at turn t + N.\n> \n> For (1,5), life span 5 at turn 21, so it disappears after turn 25? Let's say at turn 21, countdown is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including current. After turn 21, countdown becomes 4, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So it will be gone at the start of turn 26? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically: at the beginning of turn t, the food is present with life span L. After the snake moves, if it eats, food is consumed. Then, at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given at current turn, so for turn t=21, food has life span L, meaning after this turn, it will have L-1, and so on.\n> \n> For simplicity, I think we can think that the food will disappear after L turns from now, so for (1,5), it will be gone after turn 21 + 5 - 1? Better to think in terms of remaining turns.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L means it has L turns left including t, so it can be eaten in turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (1,5) at turn 21, life span 5, so it can be eaten in turns 21,22,23,24,25, and disappears at turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,2), life span 8, can be eaten from turn 21 to 28, disappears at turn 29.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,4), direction U, so last move was up to (1,4) from (1,3)? Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,3), ...] so head is (1,4), and previous was (1,3), so since it moved to (1,4) from (1,3), and direction is U, which is consistent, (1,3) to (1,4) is up.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so from (1,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since current direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, L, R. D is not allowed.\n> \n> U: to (1,5)\n> \n> L: to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> R: to (2,4)\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (2,4) is listed, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (1,4), moving U to (1,5) or L to (0,4) but x=0 wall, invalid, R to (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, invalid. D is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (1,5).\n> \n> But (1,5) has food, with value +1.\n> \n> If I move to (1,5), I eat the food, snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger.\n> \n> First, let's see if moving to (1,5) is safe.\n> \n> (1,5) is the food position.\n> \n> After moving, snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (1,5), then the body: since it eats, a new segment is added at the end? No, in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Snake positions: current [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) ]\n> \n> After moving U to (1,5), and since there is food, it eats, so new head is (1,5), and the tail stays, so body becomes [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) ] with a new segment? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, so the new position is head at (1,5), then previous head (1,4) becomes body, and so on, down to the tail, which was (4,6), and since it grows, (4,6) stays, and a new segment is added after the tail? Standard snake growth: after moving to a food cell, the head moves to the food, and the tail does not move, so the snake increases in length by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (1,5), then the rest: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), and since it grows, (4,6) is still there, so 9 segments.\n> \n> Now, is there any collision? Head at (1,5), body segments: (1,4), (1,3), etc. (1,4) is adjacent, but not the same cell, so no collision yet.\n> \n> But let's check the grid.\n> \n> Also, walls: (1,5) is within bounds? x=1, y=5, walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 are borders, but x=1,y=5 should be free, except for internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,5) not listed, so safe.\n> \n> But after moving, head at (1,5), and body at (1,4), which is directly below, but in the next moves, I need to be careful.\n> \n> Now, the food at (1,5) has life span 5, so it can be eaten now.\n> \n> But I have to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is another food at (2,2).\n> \n> Now, from (1,5), after moving U, head is at (1,5), direction was U, but after moving, the new direction depends on what I do next.\n> \n> But for future moves, I need to consider.\n> \n> Moreover, the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,6), which has no food, so not an issue.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (1,5), I am at (1,5), with direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Possible next moves: from (1,5), I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since I just moved U, I cannot move D down immediately.\n> \n> So possible: U to (1,6), L to (0,5) invalid, R to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, (1,6): is it wall? Internal obstacles include (1,6), which is a wall, so (1,6) is occupied by wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> R to (2,5): (2,5) not listed as wall, so should be free.\n> \n> D is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So from (1,5), only possible move is R to (2,5)? U to (1,6) is wall, L to (0,5) wall, D not allowed, so only R to (2,5).\n> \n> Then at (2,5), direction R.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move U, D, L, but not R? Current direction would be R, so cannot move L left immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is wall, internal obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> (1,5) is where I just came from, but it might be occupied by body now.\n> \n> After I move to (1,5), body is at (1,4), (1,3), etc., so (1,5) is head, (1,4) is body, so (1,5) is free only if not occupied.\n> \n> But when I move from (1,5) to elsewhere, (1,5) becomes body.\n> \n> In the sequence: at turn 21, move U to (1,5), eat food, snake grows: positions [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Head at (1,5), tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now turn 22, I move R to (2,5), as only option, I think.\n> \n> Then new head at (2,5), and since no food there, tail moves, so positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), and tail (4,6) moves to? When no eat, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Snake moves: head to new position, if no food, tail is removed, so body shifts.\n> \n> After move to (2,5) no food, so new positions: head (2,5), then previous head (1,5) becomes body, then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), and (4,6) is removed? Segments: original 8, after eating at turn 21, 9 segments. After moving without eating, it should be 8 segments again? No.\n> \n> At turn 21: after eating, positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)] 9 segments.\n> \n> At turn 22, move to (2,5), no food at (2,5), so head moves to (2,5), body: the segment from (1,5) to (1,4) to etc., but the tail (4,6) is removed, so new positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]?

So positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] 9 segments? No, when no eat, the snake length stays the same, so from 9 segments, after moving without eating, it should have 9 segments but the tail moves.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, head moves there, tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so length same.\n> \n> In terms of positions: let S be the list of positions, head at S[0].\n> \n> After moving to new position P:\n> \n> - If P has food, new positions: [P] + S, so S[0] becomes S[1], etc., and S[-1] remains, length +1.\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: [P] + S[:-1], so S[0] becomes S[1], ..., S[-2] becomes S[-1], S[-1] is removed, length same.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 21, after moving to (1,5) with food, new positions: head (1,5), then previous positions: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc. up to (4,6), so 9 segments.\n> \n> Then at turn 22, moving to (2,5) no food, so new head (2,5), then the previous body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), and (4,6) is removed. Previous positions had (1,5) to (4,6), 9 segments. After move, new positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) — that's 9 positions, but (4,6) is gone, so (3,6) is now the tail, and (3,6) was the second last, so positions from index 0 to 8: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Length is 9, but since no food eaten, it should be length 8?

So 9 positions, but S[0:8] is from index 0 to 7, which is 8 elements: S[0] to S[7] are positions 1 to 8 of the list, but the list has indices 0 to 8, S[0] to S[8].\n> \n> S has 9 elements, indices 0 to 8.\n> \n> After no eat, new positions: [new_head] + S[0] to S[7] , so S[0] to S[7] are 8 elements, plus new head, 9 elements?

It's turn 22. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So cells that are walls or obstacles cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given as coordinates, so (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) are blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving in the positive y-direction? In grid terms, usually y increases up or down? The movement says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so U is up, increasing y, D is down, decreasing y. L is left, decreasing x, R is right, increasing x.\n> \n> Head direction U, so current movement is up, meaning next move could be U, L, or R, but not D because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (2,2), life span 7 at turn 22, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning on turn 29 or when countdown reaches 0? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 22, life span is 7, after turn 22, it decreases to 6, and so on, until turn 22 + 7 - 1 = turn 28, it has life span 1, then after turn 28, it disappears, so not available on turn 29. Similarly for (6,3), life span 10, disappears after turn 31.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 22.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Since head is at (1,5), moving down to (1,4) would collide with body, but let's check collision rules.\n> \n> Deadly collisions: body collision except that you can move into the tail cell if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, head can move to the current tail position because the tail will move forward, so after move, it's not occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,5), then body: (1,4), (1,3), etc., tail is (4,6).\n> \n> If I move down to (1,4), that is currently occupied by the second segment.

It's turn 23. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). So, these cells are blocked; I can't move into them.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (2,5), then body segments at (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). So, the snake is 9 units long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (2,2) with value 1 and life span 6. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 6 turns, so by turn 29 (23+6=29, but since it decreases on turn 23, it might be gone by turn 29? Let's clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns, counting from now. So on turn 23, life span is 6, so it decreases to 5 on turn 24, to 4 on turn 25, ..., to 0 on turn 29, and disappears after that turn, I think. Typically, it might be present until the end of turn when life span reaches 0. But for planning, I need to know when it vanishes. Assuming it vanishes when life span reaches 0, which would be after turn 28? Let's calculate: current turn t=23, life span 6. After turn 23, it decreases to 5. After turn 24, to 4. After turn 25, to 3. After turn 26, to 2. After turn 27, to 1. After turn 28, to 0, and then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 23 to turn 28 inclusive? I need to be careful. The rule says: \"life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn 23, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one. After turn 23, it will have 5 left, and so on, until after turn 28, it has 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on any turn from 23 to 28, and is gone by turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 9. So it can be eaten from turn 23 to turn 31 (23+8=31, since 9 turns: after 23, 8 left?

(2,2) – let's see if it's obstacle: obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), etc., (2,2) is not listed, so it should be free, but snake body might be on it? Snake positions are given, so (2,2) is not occupied by snake; snake is at (2,5), etc., down to (3,6). (2,2) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,5) moving right, so from (2,5), possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> But head direction is R, so moving right would be to (3,5). But (3,5) is occupied by body? Snake positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), etc., and (3,5) is part of body? Let's list snake segments:\n> \n> Index 0: head (2,5)\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (1,4)\n> \n> 3: (1,3)\n> \n> 4: (2,3)\n> \n> 5: (3,3)\n> \n> 6: (3,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,5)\n> \n> 8: (3,6)  // tail\n> \n> (3,5) is the second last segment, position 7.\n> \n> Since the tail moves when snake moves, if head moves to (3,5), it would collide with body because (3,5) is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail? The rule is: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment only if the tail is moving away, but generally, moving into any body cell except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, but other body cells are not.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,5), moving right to (3,5): (3,5) is currently occupied by a body segment (index 7). But when the snake moves, if head goes to (3,5), and since (3,5) was occupied, but the segment that was there will move to where the head was? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at (2,5) becomes body at (2,5), but since head moves, the body shifts.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to (3,5), then:\n> \n> - New head at (3,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (2,5) becomes the new neck at (2,5)\n> \n> - Then (1,5) moves to (2,5)? Let's think of the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) ]\n> \n> After moving right:\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,5) — but (3,5) is currently occupied by the 7th segment. If head moves to (3,5), since (3,5) is a body cell, it would be a collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,6), so (3,5) is not the tail; it's the second last. So moving to (3,5) would cause head to collide with the body segment there, which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (1,5): (1,5) is the first body segment, index 1. So moving left to (1,5) would also cause collision.\n> \n> Moving up: from (2,5), up to (2,6). Is (2,6) free? Let's see.\n> \n> (2,6): not a wall, not an obstacle. Snake positions: (3,6) is tail, but (2,6) is not occupied. So moving up to (2,6) should be safe, as long as no wall or other body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (2,4). (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), yes, (2,4) is blocked, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (2,4) is listed as internal obstacle, so it's wall, cannot move.\n> \n> So from (2,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (2,6) — y+1, so U\n> \n> - Down: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - Left: to (1,5) — but (1,5) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - Right: to (3,5) — occupied by body segment (index 7, which is not tail), collision.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,6), so only moving to (3,6) might be safe if tail moves away.\n> \n> But (3,5) is not tail; tail is (3,6).\n> \n> So the only possible move without immediate death is up to (2,6).\n> \n> Is that right? (2,6) is free? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells: (2,6) — x=2, y=6. Borders: y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable. Not obstacle: obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake: positions include (1,5), (1,4), etc., but not (2,6). (3,6) is snake, but that's different cell.\n> \n> (2,6) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, are there any other options? Down is blocked, left and right are body collision.\n> \n> So only possible move is up to (2,6).\n> \n> But head direction is R, moving right, but since right is blocked by body, it can't go there.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: but left is opposite to current direction R, so moving left would be reverse, which is not allowed if it's the next move? The rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is R (right). Opposite is L (left). So moving left is not allowed because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Similarly, moving up or down are perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> So from (2,5), moving left to (1,5) is both body collision and instant reverse, so doubly bad.\n> \n> Moving right to (3,5) is body collision.\n> \n> Moving down to (2,4) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> Moving up to (2,6) is the only viable option.\n> \n> But let's make sure about (2,6): is it within bounds? x=2, y=6, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so yes. Not wall, not obstacle, not snake-occupied currently.\n> \n> After moving, the tail will move from (3,6) to where? When head moves to (2,6), the body shifts: new head at (2,6), then the segment that was head becomes body at (2,5), and so on, down to tail moving from (3,6) to the previous position of the second last segment, which was (3,5) or something. But since we're moving, the cell (3,6) will be vacated, but we're not moving there.\n> \n> So for turn 23, action must be U, move up to (2,6).\n> \n> Then, after that, the snake positions will be: head at (2,6), then body at (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Tail was at (3,6), which is now vacated, and the new tail is the segment that was at (3,5), I think.

Segment 4 to (1,4). Segment 5 to (1,3). Segment 6 to (2,3). Segment 7 to (3,3). Segment 8 to (3,4).

It's turn 25, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and also internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then body segments at (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), and tail at (3,4). The head direction is right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 4\n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n> - (3,4) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span means how many turns until they disappear. For (2,2), life span 4, so it disappears after turn 25 + 4 = turn 29? Let me confirm: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 25, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left including this one, so it will disappear after turn 28 or on turn 29? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1. After turn t+1, to N-2, and so on, until it reaches 0. When life span is 0, it should disappear before the next turn or something. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it's there for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it will be available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+N or end of turn t+N-1? I think for simplicity, since countdown decreases every turn, when life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, at turn t+1, life span is N-1, and so on. When life span is 1 at turn t, after turn t, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,2): life span 4 at turn 25. After turn 25, it will have life span 3 at turn 26, then 2 at 27, 1 at 28, and after turn 28, it disappears, so not available on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): life span 7 at turn 25, so available until turn 31 (since 25+6=31, life span decreases to 0 after turn 31? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 25: life span 7\n> - After turn 25: life span 6 (for turn 26)\n> - Turn 26: life span 6\n> - After turn 26: life span 5\n> - ...\n> - Turn 31: life span 1 (available)\n> - After turn 31: life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): life span 10, available until turn 34 (turn 25 to turn 34, life span 1 at turn 34, disappears after).\n> \n> But (3,4) is also a snake position? Let's see: snake positions include (3,4), which is the tail.\n> \n> (3,4) is listed as food, but it's also occupied by the snake's tail.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (3,4), it's under the tail, so it can be eaten only if the tail moves away and then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (3,4), and food is there, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten until the snake moves off that cell.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail grows and collides with the head.\n> \n> In this case, the head is at (3,6), tail at (3,4). Are they adjacent? (3,6) and (3,4) are two cells apart vertically? y=6 and y=4, so |dy|=2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (3,6) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are two cells away. So no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,6), direction right, so moving east.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is right, I can move up, down, or right, but not left because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.

It's turn 26, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so those are out of bounds. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), and direction is D (down). The body segments are: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 9 segments.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 26, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left: turn 26, 27, 28. It disappears after turn 28, so can be eaten on turns 26, 27, or 28.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Say at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, L decreases by 1. So at turn t, it can be eaten, and L decreases to L-1. If L was 1, it disappears after being eaten or after the turn if not eaten. The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has remaining life R. After the turn, R decreases by 1. If R was 1, it disappears after this turn if not eaten. So for food at (2,2) with life span 3 at turn 26: on turn 26, R=3; after turn 26, R=2; after turn 27, R=1; after turn 28, R=0, so it disappears, meaning it can be eaten on turn 26, 27, or 28.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) value 1, life span 6: can be eaten until turn 31 (since 26+6-1=31? Turn 26: R=6, eaten or not, after turn R=5; ... after turn 31: R=0, disappears.

Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body except tail.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so I cannot do instant reverse to U next turn. So on turn 26, since head direction is D, I can move D, L, or R, but not U because U is opposite to D.\n> \n> Directions: U is up (y+1), D is down (y-1), L left (x-1), R right (x+1). In grid, y=0 is bottom? Typically in coordinates, y increases up, but in games, sometimes y increases down. Let's see the walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake positions: head (3,5), then (3,6) which is up from (3,5)? (3,5) to (3,6): if y increases up, (3,6) is above (3,5), but direction is D, down. Inconsistency.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), ...]\n> \n> (3,5) to (3,6): from (3,5) to (3,6), that's increasing y, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, then (3,6) is above (3,5), so moving from (3,5) to (3,6) is up (U). But head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Current head position is (3,5), and previous position must be such that the direction is into (3,5). The positions are listed head first, so head at (3,5), then next is (3,6), which is the first body segment. So the snake moved from some position to (3,5). Since direction is D, down, that means it came from above, so previous head position was (3,6) or something. Positions: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: (3,6), index 2: (2,6), etc.\n> \n> The snake segments: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the current positions are at the start of turn 26.\n> \n> At the start of turn 26, snake is at: head (3,5), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3).\n> \n> Direction is D, meaning that on the previous turn (turn 25), the head was at some position and moved down to (3,5). Since head is at (3,5) and body segment 1 is at (3,6), that means on turn 25, head was at (3,6), and it moved down to (3,5), so direction into (3,5) is down, so current direction is D.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: up to (3,6) - but (3,6) is occupied by the body segment, and it's not the tail, so it would be a collision. (3,6) is the first body segment, not tail. Tail is at (3,3). So moving to (3,6) would be head touching body, collision, death.\n> \n> - D: down to (3,4) - what's at (3,4)? Food is at (3,4) with value 1, life span 9. But (3,4) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (3,5), then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). (3,4) is not in the list, so it's empty? Food is there, but we need to see if it's free.\n> \n> (3,4) has food, but is it under the snake? Snake positions don't include (3,4), so it should be free, but let's list all snake positions: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). So cells occupied: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). (3,4) is not occupied, so moving to (3,4) should be possible, and since food is there, eating it.\n> \n> But is there any issue? Tail is at (3,3), so after eating, the snake grows, so new tail will be added, so positions will be head at (3,4), then body including the old tail.\n> \n> Now, moving D to (3,4): (3,4) is below (3,5), since y decreases down? Coordinates: let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so (3,5) to (3,4) is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> (3,4) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows to length 10.\n> \n> - L: left to (2,5) - (2,5) is occupied by body segment, index 3 in the list: (2,5) is the fourth segment? Positions: 0:(3,5), 1:(3,6), 2:(2,6), 3:(2,5), so (2,5) is occupied, so moving left to (2,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> - R: right to (4,5) - is (4,5) free? Walls: borders x=0 and x=7, so x=4 is between 1 and 6, y=5 between 1 and 6, so not border. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) — (4,5) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions don't have (4,5), so moving right to (4,5) is possible.\n> \n> Also, no food there, so just move.\n> \n> Now, I cannot move U because instant reverse and also occupied, but U is opposite to D, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - D to (3,4): eats food, snake grows\n> \n> - R to (4,5): empty cell\n> \n> - L and U not possible due to collision or reverse.\n> \n> L to (2,5) is occupied, U to (3,6) occupied and reverse.\n> \n> So only D and R are possible without death.\n> \n> Now, D to (3,4) eats the food at (3,4).\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (3,3). Head is at (3,5), adjacent cells: up (3,6) body, down (3,4) food, left (2,5) body, right (4,5) empty.\n> \n> Tail at (3,3), which is not adjacent to head; head is at (3,5), tail at (3,3), so they are two cells apart vertically. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,5) and (3,4) adjacent, (3,4) and (3,3) adjacent, but head to tail: (3,5) to (3,3) not adjacent; there's (3,4) in between or something.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (3,5): north (3,6), south (3,4), west (2,5), east (4,5).\n> \n> Tail is at (3,3), which is south of (3,4), so not directly adjacent to head. So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> If I move to (3,4), I eat the food, snake grows, new head at (3,4), and tail stays where it is? No, when snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position after the move.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't advance; the new position becomes the tail.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,4), eat food, then the snake body: old positions except the head moves to (3,4), and the tail remains, so new segments: head (3,4), then (3,5) [previous head], then (3,6), (2,6), etc., down to (3,3) as new tail? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move: positions: head (3,5), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> After move down to (3,4) and eat: new head at (3,4), then body: (3,5) [previous head], then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) and since it grows, we add a new segment at the tail? No, in snake growth, when you eat, the tail doesn't move; so the new body includes all old positions plus the new head, and tail stays.\n> \n> Positions after move: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, but since it grows, the last segment doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail moves away.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food cell, body segments follow, but the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> For example, before move: head A, body B, C, tail D.\n> \n> Move to new cell E: if not food, new head E, body A, B, tail C (D is gone).\n> \n> If E has food, new head E, body A, B, C, and new tail D (D stays, snake grows).\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the tail position remains, and a new segment is added there, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,4) with food: new head at (3,4), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), and since ate, we add a new segment at (3,3)? No.\n> \n> The tail was at (3,3), and it stays, so new positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), and tail (3,3) — but (3,3) is already there, and it doesn't move, so it's still part of the body. So the snake now has segments: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — 10 segments.\n> \n> Tail is still at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, back to the move: moving D to (3,4) is safe and eats food.\n> \n> Moving R to (4,5) is safe, no food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,2): value 1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 28 (turns 26,27,28)\n> \n> - (6,3): value 1, life span 6, eaten by turn 31\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life span 9, eaten by turn 34, but it's right below head, so I can eat it now.\n> \n> (3,4) is at (3,4), head at (3,5), so I can eat it immediately by moving down.\n> \n> But is there a reason not to? For example, if I eat it, the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver later.\n> \n> But since all food is positive, growing is good for score, but I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, the food at (2,2) has short life, only 3 turns left, so I might want to go for it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is far, life longer.\n> \n> Current head position (3,5), direction down.\n> \n> If I move down to (3,4), eat food, then head at (3,4), direction down (since I moved D).\n> \n> Then from (3,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But U would be to (3,5), which is now the body segment (previous head), so occupied, collision.\n> \n> D to (3,3) — (3,3) is the tail. But after eating, when I move, the tail will move or not?\n> \n> After eating on turn 26, positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, on turn 27, I move from (3,4).\n> \n> If I move D to (3,3), but (3,3) is the tail. In snake, when you move, if you move to the tail position, it's okay because the tail moves away simultaneously. Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail cell is safe, as long as no other body.\n> \n> But here, (3,3) is tail, so moving to (3,3) is safe; the tail moves to the next position, but since we ate, the tail doesn't move? No.\n> \n> After eating, on the next move, the tail does move.\n> \n> Sequence: on turn 26, after moving to (3,4) and eating, snake is at: head (3,4), segments: (3,5), (3,6), ..., (3,3)\n> \n> Now on turn 27, if I move down to (3,3), new head to (3,3), but (3,3) is current tail. Since I move to tail, and tail is moving, it's okay. After move, head moves to (3,3), body moves: (3,4) becomes first body, (3,5) next, ..., up to (2,3), and the tail (3,3) moves away to where? The segment before tail is (2,3), so tail moves to (2,3)? Let's list positions.\n> \n> Before turn 27 move: positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), tail (3,3)\n> \n> After moving head down to (3,3): new head at (3,3). Now, the body segments move to the previous position: the segment after head is (3,5), which moves to head's old position (3,4). Then (3,6) moves to (3,5), (2,6) moves to (3,6), (2,5) moves to (2,6), (1,5) moves to (2,5), (1,4) moves to (1,5), (1,3) moves to (1,4), (2,3) moves to (1,3), and the tail (3,3) moves to (2,3)? The tail was (3,3), and it should move to the position of the segment before it, which is (2,3). But (2,3) is moving to (1,3), so the tail moves to where (2,3) was.\n> \n> Positions before move:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (3,4)\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,6)\n> \n> 3: (2,6)\n> \n> 4: (2,5)\n> \n> 5: (1,5)\n> \n> 6: (1,4)\n> \n> 7: (1,3)\n> \n> 8: (2,3)\n> \n> 9: tail (3,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,3):\n> \n> New head: (3,3)\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to old head position (3,4)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position (2,6)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to old segment 4 position (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 6 moves to old segment 5 position (1,5)\n> \n> Segment 7 moves to old segment 6 position (1,4)\n> \n> Segment 8 moves to old segment 7 position (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 9 (tail) moves to old segment 8 position (2,3)\n> \n> And since no food eaten, tail is removed? No, when not eating, the tail moves and the cell is freed.\n> \n> In this case, after move, new positions: head (3,3), then body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) — and tail was at (3,3), but it moved to (2,3), so positions are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) — same as before but shifted, tail now at (2,3).\n> \n> Length 9, no growth.\n> \n> But in our case, if I move to (3,4) on turn 26 and eat, then on turn 27 if I move to (3,3), it's safe because tail is there but moves.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 26, from (3,5), I can:\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (3,4) - eat food, grow to 10, head at (3,4), direction D.\n> \n> Then from (3,4), I can move L, R, or D (to (3,3)), but not U because (3,5) is body.\n> \n> D to (3,3): (3,3) is currently tail, but after eating, it might be different.\n> \n> After eating on turn 26, positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> On turn 27, from (3,4), move D to (3,3): new head to (3,3), body moves: (3,5) to (3,4), (3,6) to (3,5), (2,6) to (3,6), etc., and tail (3,3) moves to (2,3), so new head at (3,3), which is fine.\n> \n> Then head at (3,3), direction D.\n> \n> From there, I can go to (2,3) or (3,2) or (4,3), but (2,3) is body? New positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) — so (2,3) is body, so moving to (2,3) collision, moving to (3,2) if free, or (4,3).\n> \n> (3,2): walls, y=0 is bottom, so y=2 is ok, x=3 ok. Internal obstacles: (3,1) is wall, but (3,2) not listed, so free. No food, I think.\n> \n> Food at (2,2), (6,3), (3,4) eaten.\n> \n> So from (3,3), I can go south to (3,2) or east to (4,3) or west to (2,3) but occupied.\n> \n> North to (3,4) occupied.\n> \n> So possible: S to (3,2) or E to (4,3).\n> \n> Then I can go towards (2,2) for the food.\n> \n> (2,2) is at (2,2), which is west and south from (3,3).\n> \n> From (3,3), to (2,3) is west but occupied, so I need to go south to (3,2) first or something.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> Option at turn 26: move R to (4,5) instead of D.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5), no food, so snake moves, head to (4,5), body: (3,5) becomes first body, then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — tail moves to (2,3) or something.\n> \n> Before move: head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Move R to (4,5): new head (4,5), then body: (3,5) [previous head], then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), and tail (3,3) moves to (2,3)? Segment 8 is (2,3), segment 9 is (3,3), so after move, new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) — tail at (2,3), and (3,3) is free now.\n> \n> Length 9, no change.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> From there, I can go U, D, L, R, but not instant reverse to L.\n> \n> L to (3,5) is body, collision.\n> \n> U to (4,6): what is there? y=6, x=4.

It's turn 27. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so those are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So the snake can only move to cells that are not walls and not obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). So that's 10 segments. Head direction is D, meaning down, so currently moving down, but since head is at (3,4) and direction is D, moving down would go to (3,3), but (3,3) is part of the body? Let's list the positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,4) - head\n> \n> Index 1: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 3: (2,6)\n> \n> Index 4: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 5: (1,5)\n> \n> Index 6: (1,4)\n> \n> Index 7: (1,3)\n> \n> Index 8: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 9: (3,3) - tail\n> \n> Since direction is D, down, and head is at (3,4), moving down would go to (3,3), but (3,3) is the tail. According to the rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward when the snake moves, so it shouldn't cause a collision unless the snake grows. But let's confirm the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves away, so the cell that was tail becomes empty. But if the head moves to the current tail position, since the tail is about to move, it should be okay. The rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So moving to (3,3) should be safe because after the move, the tail will be at a different position.\n> \n> Similarly, body collision only if head touches any body segment except the tail in this case.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 2\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: (2,2) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 27, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 28? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So for (2,2), life span 2 at turn 27:\n> \n> - After turn 27, countdown becomes 1\n> \n> - After turn 28, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears before turn 29? I think we need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at the start of turn 27, life span is 2. After this turn (turn 27), it decreases to 1. After turn 28, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) has life span 5, so it will last until turn 31 or something.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. But since playable area is inside, cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n> \n> For movement, snake can only be on cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) and (1,6) are within 1-6, so they are obstacles.\n> \n> Also, snake is on: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> (3,6) is at y=6, which is border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> Now, (3,6): x=3,y=6, which is within 1-6, and not a wall, but is it an obstacle? Obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,6) is obstacle, (3,6) is not listed, so it's free but occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> List all forbidden cells:\n> \n> - Walls: all with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7\n> \n> - Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> - Snake body except tail when moving, but for pathing, we need to avoid current body positions except the tail cell if we can move there safely.\n> \n> For planning, we need to consider where the snake can move without colliding.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4)\n> \n> Direction: D (down)\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4): U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so cannot move U (up), because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible actions: D (down), L (left), R (right)\n> \n> - D: to (3,3) — this is the tail, currently occupied by tail at (3,3). But since tail will move, it should be safe.\n> \n> - L: to (2,4) — (2,4) is an obstacle? Obstacles include (2,4), yes, (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: to (4,4) — is (4,4) free? Let's see: x=4,y=4, not border, not in obstacles list: obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (4,4) not listed, and not snake body? Snake body: positions are (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). (4,4) is not occupied, so free.\n> \n> So from (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (3,3) — tail, safe\n> \n> - L: to (2,4) — obstacle, not possible\n> \n> - R: to (4,4) — free\n> \n> U is not possible because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only two options: D or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Food: (2,2) with life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 28.\n> \n> (6,3) with life span 5, can be eaten later.\n> \n> (2,2) is at (2,2), which is not far, but let's see if we can reach it.\n> \n> First, consider moving to (2,2).\n> \n> From head (3,4), to go to (2,2), we need to go left and down, but directly left to (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot go left from current position.\n> \n> The only possible moves now are down to (3,3) or right to (4,4).\n> \n> If we go down to (3,3), that is the tail. After moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food, otherwise not.\n> \n> If we move to (3,3), which is the current tail, and since we don't eat food there (no food at (3,3)), so the tail moves away, and head is at (3,3), tail was at (3,3) but moves to the next segment.\n> \n> After move, snake positions: head moves to new position, if no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> So if move D to (3,3), since (3,3) was tail, and no food there, so after move: head at (3,3), and tail was removed, so body segments: the new body starts from (3,4), which was head, now body, and so on.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0: (3,4) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (3,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (2,5), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3) tail.\n> \n> After move D to (3,3): head moves to (3,3), which was tail. Since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new snake: head at (3,3), then body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3). So (2,3) is now the tail? Positions: new head at (3,3), then the previous segments from index 0 to 8 except tail is removed, so segments: new head at (3,3), then (3,4) [prev head], (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and (2,3) is now the last body segment, tail.\n> \n> Previous indices: after move, the head is at new position (3,3), then the body is the old body minus the tail if no grow. Old body was positions 1 to 9: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). But since head moves to (3,3), which was part of body, but in this case (3,3) was tail, so when head moves to tail, and no food, tail is removed, so the new body consists of all old segments except the tail is gone. So new head at (3,3), new body: old positions 1 to 8: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3). So positions: head (3,3), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3). (2,3) is tail. But (3,4) is missing? Old position 0 was (3,4), which is now the first body segment? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head, and if no food, tail is removed, so the body shifts.\n> \n> So from old positions: [ (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n> \n> Head moves to (3,3). Since (3,3) was the tail, and no food, so tail is removed, so new positions: head at (3,3), then the remaining body is [ (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ] but (2,3) is the last segment, but (3,3) was removed, so the body is from old head to old second last: old index 0 to 8, but index 0 is (3,4), which becomes the first body segment after head.\n> \n> New head: (3,3)\n> \n> New body segments: the old segments from index 0 to 8: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> But (2,3) is now the tail.\n> \n> And (3,3) was old tail, removed.\n> \n> Now, the cell (3,4) is still occupied, but it's body.\n> \n> If we move R to (4,4), head to (4,4), no food there, so tail removed, new positions: head (4,4), body [ (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ] and tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, back to food: (2,2) needs to be eaten soon.\n> \n> (2,2) is at (2,2), which is free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (2,2) is free).\n> \n> But currently occupied? Snake is not on it, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> To reach (2,2) from current position (3,4), we need to go left and down, but (2,4) is obstacle, so we cannot go directly left.\n> \n> Possible path: from (3,4), if we go down to (3,3), then from (3,3) we can go left to (2,3) or down to (3,2) or right to (4,3), etc.\n> \n> (2,3) is part of the body, but after we move to (3,3), (2,3) is the tail, so moving to (2,3) might be safe if it's tail.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) might be free.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> First, for turn 27, actions: D or R.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (3,3)\n> \n> Then snake at turn 27 after move: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> Direction: since we moved down, new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse, current direction D, so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> Possible: D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3)\n> \n> - D to (3,2): (3,2) is free? Not wall, not obstacle: obstacles (3,1) but (3,2) not listed, so free. Not occupied by snake? Current body: (3,4), (3,5), etc., (3,2) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> - L to (2,3): (2,3) is the current tail, so it should be safe to move there.\n> \n> - R to (4,3): (4,3) free? x=4,y=3, not border, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n> \n> Now, if we want to go to (2,2), from (3,3), moving L to (2,3) would be to the tail, then from there, we can move down to (2,2), since (2,2) is below (2,3).\n> \n> (2,3) to (2,2) is down.\n> \n> But (2,2) has food, so if we eat it, we grow.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 27 after move to (3,3), tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> (2,2) is adjacent to tail? (2,3) and (2,2) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> If head is at (2,3) and we move to (2,2), but (2,2) has food, so we eat it and grow. But after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows, and the new tail is the old tail position? When you eat, the tail stays, so the new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> Standard: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell with food, snake length increases by one, and the tail remains where it was.\n> \n> In this case, if head is at (2,3) and moves down to (2,2), which has food, so head moves to (2,2), eats food, grows, so tail does not move. The new position: head at (2,2), body includes the previous head (2,3) and all previous body, and tail is still at the old tail position.\n> \n> But in the \"Tail Reward Danger\", it says if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this scenario, the food is at (2,2), not at the tail cell. The tail cell is (2,3), which does not have food.\n> \n> The danger is when the food is under the tail, and head moves to it.\n> \n> But here, food is at (2,2), tail is at (2,3), so if head moves to (2,2), it's not the tail cell, so it should be fine.\n> \n> The rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> But in this case, the food is not at the tail cell; it's at (2,2), tail is at (2,3). So no issue.\n> \n> For example, from (3,3), if we move L to (2,3), which is tail, safe.\n> \n> Then at turn 28, from (2,3), we can move D to (2,2), eat food, since (2,2) has food.\n> \n> Life span of (2,2) is 2 at turn 27. After turn 27, it decreases to 1, so on turn 28, it is still there, and after turn 28, it disappears. So we can eat it on turn 28.\n> \n> Turn 27: we move to (3,3), no food eaten.\n> \n> Then turn 28: from (2,3) head (after previous move), we move D to (2,2), eat food, snake grows.\n> \n> But let's confirm the state.\n> \n> At turn 27 start: food (2,2) life span 2.\n> \n> After turn 27, life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> At turn 28, if we eat it, it's fine.\n> \n> If we don't eat by turn 28, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, back to option: if we go D on turn 27 to (3,3).\n> \n> Then turn 28: from (3,3), we can move L to (2,3), which is tail, so safe, head to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, at this point, snake positions: after turn 27 move to (3,3), head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> After move L to (2,3), head to (2,3), which was tail. Since no food at (2,3)? (2,3) has no food, food is at (2,2), so no eat, so tail removed, which was (2,3), but head is moving to (2,3), which was tail, and no food, so tail removed, but since head is moving to that cell, and it's empty after tail moves? Confusing.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if that cell is the current tail, and no food, then after move, head is there, tail is removed, so effectively the snake shortens.\n> \n> In this case: from positions: head (3,3), body segments: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail (2,3).\n> \n> Move head to (2,3), which is current tail. No food at (2,3), so after move: new head at (2,3), and since no grow, tail removed. The tail was (2,3), but it's occupied by head now, so the body becomes: the old body except the last segment is gone. Old body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail was (2,3) but removed, so new body is (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and new tail at (1,3)? Positions: new head at (2,3), then body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So tail at (1,3).\n> \n> (1,3) is now tail.\n> \n> Then, from (2,3), we can move to (2,2) on turn 28.\n> \n> Move D to (2,2), which has food, so eat it, grow.\n> \n> Head moves to (2,2), eats food, so tail does not move. New head at (2,2), body includes (2,3) (previous head), and all previous body: (3,4), (3,5), etc., and tail remains at (1,3) for now? When eating, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and since we ate, add a new segment at tail, so tail becomes the old tail position, meaning we add a segment at (1,3), so the tail is still at (1,3), but now it's part of a longer body.\n> \n> Length increases, so from 10 segments, after eat, 11 segments.\n> \n> Positions: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3), then previous body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and since ate, add new segment at (1,3), so (1,3) is now second last, and tail at (1,3)? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head eats, it moves to food cell, and the tail does not advance, so a new segment is added at the tail position. So the previous tail position becomes the new tail, and the segment before that is now part of body.\n> \n> Before move to (2,2): head at (2,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail.\n> \n> After move to (2,2) with eat: head at (2,2), then (2,3) [previous head], then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) [previous tail], and since ate, add a new segment at (1,3), so the new tail is at (1,3), but (1,3) is already there, so it's like the tail stays, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and the new segment at (1,3)? That doesn't make sense; it should be that the new segment is added after the previous tail, so the list becomes longer.\n> \n> The body segments include the previous positions, and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is at the position where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it's the same cell, but we add a segment there, so it's like the tail is duplicated or something.\n> \n> In terms of positions, when you eat, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail stays in place, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So the new positions: the head is at the food cell, the previous head is now the first body segment, and all previous body segments remain, and the tail is still at the old tail position, but since we add a segment, the tail is now the old tail position, and it's part of the body, but the last segment is the same as before? I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> Head at H, body B1, B2, tail at T.\n> \n> Move to new cell, if no food, new head at new, body [H, B1], tail B2 (removed).\n> \n> If move to food, new head at food, body [H, B1, B2], tail T, and since ate, add new segment at T, so new tail at T, and the segment before is B2.\n> \n> So positions: new head, H, B1, B2, T (tail).\n> \n> In this case, before move to (2,2): head at (2,3), body segments: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3).\n> \n> So body is 8 segments?

Positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and the new segment at (1,3), so we have two segments at (1,3)? That can't be.\n> \n> Mistake: when adding a segment, it is added at the current tail position, so the tail stays, and the new segment is the new tail at the same position, but that means the snake has a duplicate cell, which is not possible.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when the head eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move on this turn, so the snake grows by one cell.

It's turn 29. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is R (right), meaning it's moving east.\n> \n> Food: two pieces. One at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 4. Another at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7):\n> \n> - Walls: borders are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). Tail is (1,3).\n> \n> Food at (6,3) and (3,2).\n> \n> Head direction is R, so from (5,4), moving right would go to (6,4), but (6,4) is an internal obstacle? No, internal obstacle is at (6,4), which is a wall cell, so snake cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are walls, so (6,4) is a wall, cannot move to it.\n> \n> Similarly, other internal obstacles are walls.\n> \n> So possible moves from head position (5,4):\n> \n> - Up: (5,5)\n> \n> - Down: (5,3)\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) but (4,4) is the first body segment. But since the snake moves, when the head moves, the tail moves, so if head moves left to (4,4), which is currently occupied by body, but after movement, that cell might be free or not, but in snake game, when head moves to a cell, if it's the tail cell, it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail. Since tail moves, head can move to the current tail position, but not to other body parts.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is R, cannot move left (opposite) on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so cannot move L immediately.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R?

So (5,5) is not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Walls: (5,5) is not a border wall or internal obstacle. Borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (5,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). None is (5,5), so (5,5) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (5,3) - not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> L: (4,4) - currently occupied by body segment, but it's the segment right after head. When head moves, if head moves to (4,4), which is where the first body segment is, but after movement, that segment becomes part of the body, and the tail moves, so it might be ok only if it's the tail, but here (4,4) is not tail; tail is (1,3).\n> \n> Let's clarify collision: head cannot touch any body segment except that it can move to the current tail position because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied by the second segment. After moving, the head would be at (4,4), and the body segments shift, so the old head (5,4) becomes new second segment, and the tail (1,3) moves away. But at the moment of movement, (4,4) is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so it would cause collision because head touches a body part that isn't moving away yet.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any part of the body except the tail, it collides. If it moves to the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> Here, (4,4) is the position of the first body segment, which is not the tail. Tail is (1,3). So moving to (4,4) would cause collision because head touches a body segment that isn't the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except tail is deadly.\n> \n> Now, (4,4) is occupied, so cannot move left to (4,4).\n> \n> R to (6,4) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n> \n> U: (5,5) - let's check if occupied: snake positions don't include (5,5), walls don't include it, so free.\n> \n> D: (5,3) - similarly, not occupied, not wall.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 29, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 29 + 4 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then on turn t, with life span L, after this turn, countdown becomes L-1, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> So for food at (6,3), life span 4 at turn 29. After turn 29, life span becomes 3. After turn 30, becomes 2. After turn 31, becomes 1. After turn 32, becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 29,30,31,32? No, when life span is 1, after turn 32, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten only when countdown >0.\n> \n> On turn t, food with life span L is present and can be eaten on that turn. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n> \n> So for (6,3): on turn 29, life span 4, present. After turn 29, if not eaten, life span 3, present on turn 30. Similarly, present until after turn 32, when life span becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 29,30,31,32. Disappears after turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life span 9, so it will last until turn 29+9-1=37? Turn 29: life span 9, after turn 29: 8, ..., after turn 37: life span 1, present on turn 38?

On turn 33, S_33 = S_32 -1 after turn 32, S_32=1, after turn 32, S=0, not present.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): S_29=9, present on turns 29 to 37 (S_37=1, present; turn 38: S_38 = S_37 -1 after turn 37, S_37=1, so S_38=0, not present).\n> \n> Turn 29 to 37 is 9 turns? Turn 29: S=9, turn 30: S=8, ..., turn 37: S=1, then after turn 37, S=0, so present from turn 29 to turn 37 inclusive.

It's turn 30, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake is 10 units long. Head direction is down, meaning it was moving downward to reach (5,3) from (5,4), I think? Let's see: from turn 29 to 30, head moved to (5,3) from (5,4) since direction is D, so previous head was (5,4) which is now the first body segment.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, so on turn 30, head is at (5,3) and it just moved down from (5,4).\n> \n> Food: there are two food items.\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,3), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns including current turn, so after turn 32? Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 30, life span is 3, so it can be eaten on turn 30, 31, or 32; disappears after turn 32, I think. Let me clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, on turn t when food has life_span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: if life_span is 3 on turn 30, it can be eaten on turn 30, 31, 32; on turn 33 it's gone. Similarly for (3,2) with life_span 8 on turn 30, it can be eaten up to turn 37.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 30. So actions for turn 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and possibly more if needed, but the sequence should cover the thinking.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid instant reverse: since head direction is D (down), I cannot move up (U) on the next turn because that would be opposite. Directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So if moving down (D), opposite is up (U), so I cannot move U on turn 30 immediately.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,3)\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: (5,4) but that's where the body is? Snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,4) is the first body segment. If I move U to (5,4), that would be colliding with the body, which is deadly. Let's confirm.\n> \n> The snake positions list: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), ...] so (5,4) is occupied by the snake body. Moving to (5,4) would cause head to hit body, collision, game over. So U is not possible.\n> \n> - D: (5,2), but y=0 is wall, and borders are y=0, so (5,2) is within bounds? y=0 to y=7, so y=2 is valid, no wall at (5,2). Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal obstacles. (5,2) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free. But let's check if it's occupied by snake. Snake positions: all listed, (5,2) is not in the list, so it should be empty. Similarly, food is at (6,3) and (3,2), not at (5,2). So D to (5,2) might be possible.\n> \n> - L: (4,3). Is (4,3) occupied? Snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), etc. (4,3) not listed, so probably free. Food not there. Walls: internal obstacles include (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) — (4,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - R: (6,3). Now (6,3) has food! Value 1, positive. But I need to see if I can eat it safely.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: (5,4) — occupied by snake body, collision, deadly. Not possible.\n> \n> - D: (5,2) — seems free, no wall, no snake, no food? No food there, so just move, no eat.\n> \n> - L: (4,3) — free, no food.\n> \n> - R: (6,3) — has food, and if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because new tail grows and collides.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Snake positions: the last segment is (1,4), so tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Head is at (5,3), tail at (1,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |dx| + |dy| = 1.\n> \n> (5,3) to (1,4): dx=4, dy=1, not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, for moving to (6,3) to eat food.\n> \n> If I eat (6,3), snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (6,3), then body follows, so the tail stays where it is? No, when snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move; thus, snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move R to (6,3), I eat the food, value +1, length becomes 11. New head at (6,3), then body: (5,3) becomes new segment, then (5,4), (4,4), ..., down to (1,4) still there? Let's think.\n> \n> Current positions: [H: (5,3), B1: (5,4), B2: (4,4), B3: (3,4), B4: (3,5), B5: (3,6), B6: (2,6), B7: (2,5), B8: (1,5), B9: (1,4) tail]\n> \n> After moving R to (6,3) and eating: head moves to (6,3), then the body segments move? No, in snake, when you move, all segments shift: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and if you eat, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so tail stays.\n> \n> Standard movement: without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) leaves its position.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to food, body segments move as usual, but since food is eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively growing.\n> \n> So in this case, if I move R to (6,3) and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Then body: the first body segment was at (5,3), but that position is now occupied by the new head position? No.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head was at (5,3), moves to (6,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 1 (B1) was at (5,4), moves to where head was, (5,3)\n> \n> - B2 was at (4,4), moves to (5,4)\n> \n> - B3 at (3,4) moves to (4,4)\n> \n> - B4 at (3,5) moves to (3,4)\n> \n> - B5 at (3,6) moves to (3,5)\n> \n> - B6 at (2,6) moves to (3,6)\n> \n> - B7 at (2,5) moves to (2,6)? Let's list positions after move.\n> \n> Current positions before move:\n> \n> Index: 0: (5,3) head\n> \n> 1: (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (4,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,5)\n> \n> 5: (3,6)\n> \n> 6: (2,6)\n> \n> 7: (2,5)\n> \n> 8: (1,5)\n> \n> 9: (1,4) tail\n> \n> After moving right to (6,3) and eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,3)\n> \n> - Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment before the move.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New position 0 (head): (6,3)\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0, which was (5,3)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1, which was (5,4)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2, which was (4,4)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3, which was (3,4)\n> \n> - New position 5: old position 4, which was (3,5)\n> \n> - New position 6: old position 5, which was (3,6)\n> \n> - New position 7: old position 6, which was (2,6)\n> \n> - New position 8: old position 7, which was (2,5)\n> \n> - New position 9: old position 8, which was (1,5)\n> \n> - And since we ate, a new segment is added at old tail position, which was (1,4), so new position 10: (1,4)\n> \n> So the snake is now: head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) — length 11.\n> \n> Old tail was (1,4), and new segment added there, so positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, is there any collision? Head at (6,3), body segments: (5,3) is adjacent, but not the same cell, so no collision. Also, (6,3) is not a wall, walls include (6,4) but that's different cell.\n> \n> (6,4) is an internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So (6,4) is a wall, but (6,3) is not, so it's fine.\n> \n> So moving R to eat (6,3) seems possible and safe for this turn.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> The food at (6,3) has life span 3, meaning it can be eaten on turn 30,31,32. If I eat it on turn 30, that's fine.\n> \n> There's another food at (3,2) with life span 8, so I have time for that.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and snake position.\n> \n> First, possible actions on turn 30:\n> \n> - U: to (5,4) — occupied, collision, impossible.\n> \n> - D: to (5,2) — free, no food.\n> \n> - L: to (4,3) — free, no food.\n> \n> - R: to (6,3) — has food, can eat.\n> \n> So only three choices: D, L, R. R eats food, D and L just move without eating.\n> \n> Now, since I need to maximize score, eating food is good, so R seems attractive.\n> \n> But let's think about the future state.\n> \n> After moving R to (6,3), head at (6,3), and head direction was D, but I moved R, so new direction is R? Head direction changes based on move.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Head Direction: D\" for current turn, meaning it was moving down to reach (5,3). After I choose action, the new direction is the action I take.\n> \n> For no reverse: I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U, which we already saw is impossible anyway.\n> \n> After moving, for next turn, I cannot move opposite to the new direction.\n> \n> So if I move R on turn 30, new head position (6,3), direction R.\n> \n> Then on turn 31, from (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,4) — but (6,4) is an internal obstacle wall! Walls include (6,4), so moving to (6,4) is wall collision, deadly.\n> \n> - D: (6,2) — is this within bounds? y=0 to 7, so (6,2) ok. Walls: no wall at (6,2), obstacles not there. Snake? After move, snake positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (5,4), etc. (6,2) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> - L: (5,3) — but (5,3) is now occupied by the first body segment!

It's turn 31, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but since borders are walls, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) is an internal obstacle, but (1,1) is on the border? No, border is x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) is inside, but it's listed as an internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is also internal obstacle.

Similarly for others.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). So length 11 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning right, so it was moving to the right to (6,3) from previous position. Let's see the sequence: positions are listed from head to tail, so at turn 31, head is (6,3), previous was (5,3), which is left of (6,3), so moving right makes sense.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,2) with life_span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life_span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life_span: for (3,2), life_span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns including current, so if not eaten by turn 31+7=38, it's gone.

But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all snake segments: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). No (6,2), so free.

Moving left to (5,3) would be into the body, but let's see.\n> \n> (5,3) is the next segment, so if I move left to (5,3), that is the current position of the second segment. But in snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves, so if head moves to (5,3), which is currently occupied by the body, but since the body will move forward, it might be ok, except for the tail part.\n> \n> General rule: moving into the cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, but moving into other body cells causes collision.\n> \n> Specifically, the tail will move away when the snake moves, so the cell that was tail might be free after move.\n> \n> But in this case, if I move left to (5,3), which is currently the position of segment 1.\n> \n> After move, the head moves to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied, so collision? But in snake mechanics, when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail (which is about to move), it collides.\n> \n> But the tail is at (1,4), so (5,3) is not the tail; it's the second segment.\n> \n> So moving to (5,3) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any other body segment is death.\n> \n> Now, from above:\n> \n> - Up: (6,4) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> - Down: (6,2) is free? Let's confirm: x=6,y=2, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (3,1),(2,4),(1,1),(1,6),(6,4) — (6,4) is obstacle, (6,2) not listed, so should be free. Snake not there, so yes, can move down to (6,2).\n> \n> - Right: (7,3) is border wall, cannot.\n> \n> - Left: (5,3) is body segment, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible move is Down to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that right?

It's turn 32, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,2), then body segments: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5). So the snake has 11 segments. Head direction is Down, meaning it was moving down to (6,2) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and direction is D, that means from (6,3) to (6,2), since moving down decreases y-coordinate? Let me confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but here U is (x,y+1), which might be north, so y=7 top, y=0 bottom. D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head is at (6,2), and previous was (6,3). From (6,3) to (6,2), y decreased from 3 to 2, so that's down, which matches head direction D.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so for (3,2), it has 6 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 32 + 6 = 38? Life span is given as remaining turns, I think. Let me see the input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (3,2,6,1)\" so (x,y, life_span, value), so at turn 32, (3,2) has life_span 6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns, so on turn 39 it might be gone? Turn count: current turn t1, food disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be present for L turns including turn t, so it disappears on turn t + L. For example, at turn t, life_span L, after turn t, life_span becomes L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears before turn t+L.\n> \n> Standard: if at turn t, life_span is L, then it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given at turn 32, so for (3,2), life_span=6, so it can be eaten from turn 32 to turn 37 (since 32 + 6 - 1 = 37? Let's think: at turn 32, life_span=6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one, so it exists on turns 32,33,34,35,36,37? Then disappears on turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life_span=9, exists until turn 32+9-1=40? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life_span is N, it means after N turns, it will be gone. So at turn t, it has N turns left, including turn t. So it is present on turn t, and for the next N-1 turns, so it disappears at the start of turn t+N.\n> \n> For example: turn t, life_span N: present on turn t.\n> \n> Turn t+1, life_span N-1: present if N-1 >0.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn t + k, life_span N-k: present if N-k >0.\n> \n> Disappears when life_span becomes 0, so at turn t + N, life_span would be 0, so not present.\n> \n> So for (3,2) at turn 32, life_span=6: present on turns 32,33,34,35,36,37. Disappears on turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life_span=9: present on turns 32 to 40, disappears on turn 41.\n> \n> Now, my goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So cells to avoid: all border cells and these obstacles.\n> \n> Movable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) is on border? x=1,y=1, but border is x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so (1,1) is internal, not border. Similarly, (1,6) y=6, border y=7, so internal.\n> \n> Snake positions: list of coordinates:\n> \n> Head: (6,2)\n> \n> Body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5)\n> \n> So tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> Food: (3,2) and (6,5)\n> \n> Now, head at (6,2), direction Down. Possible moves: since head direction is D, and no instant reverse, so cannot move Up (U) because that would be opposite to D.\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move U next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> But need to check if they are safe.\n> \n> First, move Down: from (6,2) to (6,1)\n> \n> Is (6,1) safe? Not a wall? Walls: y=0 is wall, so y=1 is not wall? y=0 is bottom wall, so (6,1) is within bounds, x=6, y=1.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,1) is not listed, so should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), etc., not (6,1), so (6,1) is empty.\n> \n> But let's list all snake positions to avoid collision.\n> \n> Snake: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5)\n> \n> So (6,1) is not occupied, and not wall, so moving D to (6,1) is possible.\n> \n> Move Left: from (6,2) to (5,2)\n> \n> (5,2): not in snake positions? Snake has (5,3) and (5,4), not (5,2). Not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles include (6,4), but (5,2) is fine.\n> \n> Move Right: from (6,2) to (7,2)\n> \n> But x=7 is wall, so (7,2) is out of bounds, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> x=7 is border wall, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible actions: D or L. Cannot U (reverse), cannot R (wall).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting food.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) and (6,5).\n> \n> (3,2) is close, (6,5) is also on the same column as head.\n> \n> But head is at (6,2), food at (6,5) is up, but we are facing down, so to go to (6,5), we need to go up, but cannot immediately because of no reverse? No, we can change direction, but not instant reverse, meaning from down, we cannot go up directly, but we can go left or right, then up later.\n> \n> Instant reverse: from current direction, cannot move opposite on next turn. So from down, cannot go up immediately, but can go left or down or right, but right is invalid.\n> \n> So for now, possible moves: L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n> \n> Now, (3,2) is at (3,2), which is left and up from current position.\n> \n> Current (6,2), (3,2) is same y, x=3 vs x=6, so left 3 cells.\n> \n> But with obstacles, need path.\n> \n> (6,5) is at (6,5), same x, y=5 vs y=2, so up 3 cells.\n> \n> But we are at (6,2), moving down or left now.\n> \n> Also, need to consider the tail and body.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,5), which is far.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,2): it has life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 37.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) by turn 40.\n> \n> Since we are at turn 32, both have time.\n> \n> But (3,2) is closer and might be easier to get.\n> \n> Let me see the grid with snake and obstacles.\n> \n> Draw a grid:\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7 (0 bottom, 7 top? But movement U (x,y+1) increases y, so y=7 top, y=0 bottom. In positions, head at (6,2), body at (6,3), which is above since y=3>2, so y increases up? From (6,3) to (6,2) down, y decreased, so y=2 is below y=3, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Similarly, in snake, (3,5) to (3,6), y=6>5, so up.\n> \n> So grid: y=0 bottom, y=7 top; x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Now, obstacles:\n> \n> - (3,1): x=3,y=1\n> \n> - (2,4): x=2,y=4\n> \n> - (1,1): x=1,y=1\n> \n> - (1,6): x=1,y=6\n> \n> - (6,4): x=6,y=4\n> \n> Snake:\n> \n> Head: (6,2)\n> \n> Body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (1,5)\n> \n> So tail at (1,5)\n> \n> Food: (3,2) and (6,5)\n> \n> (6,5) is a food position, but is it occupied by snake? Snake has (3,6), (2,6), etc., but (6,5) not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) not in snake.\n> \n> Now, from head (6,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D to (6,1): y=1, which is above y=0, so safe.

So only L possible? (6,0) is wall, cannot. R to (7,1) x=7 wall, cannot. So from (6,1), with direction D, possible moves: D invalid, U is reverse cannot, L and R? L to (5,1), R to (7,1) invalid, so only L to (5,1) possible? But U is reverse, cannot, so only L or R, but R invalid, so only L to (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,1), (3,1), not (5,1), so free. Not snake, so ok.\n> \n> But if I go to (6,1), I might be stuck, because from (6,1), only move is L to (5,1), then from (5,1), direction L (since from (6,1) to (5,1), moving left, so direction L.\n> \n> Then from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1), R to (6,1) but (6,1) is now body?

Current positions before move: (5,3) is a body segment. After moving head to (5,2), the body shifts: the tail moves or something? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.

Snake positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), etc. (4,2) is not in the list, so it should be free. Obstacles: internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (4,2) not there. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, (4,2) is within bounds. So (4,2) is free.\n> \n> U to (5,3): (5,3) is a body segment? Snake positions: (5,3) is the fourth segment. Positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), so (5,3) is occupied by the body. Moving to (5,3) would cause collision with body. Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> General rule: head cannot move to a cell occupied by body, except if it's the tail and the tail will move away. But let's see.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its current position if no food is eaten. If food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But for collision: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment at that time, it collides, except if it's the tail segment and we're not eating food there or something. Rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (5,3): (5,3) is not the tail; it's a middle body segment. Tail is (2,5). So moving to (5,3) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (5,1): (5,1) is it free? Snake positions: no (5,1). Obstacles: (3,1) is an obstacle, but (5,1) not listed. Walls: y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not y=0, so (5,1) should be free unless obstacle. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), etc., (5,1) not there. So (5,1) is free.\n> \n> L to (4,2) should be free, as I thought.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,2) is at (3,2), which is adjacent to head? Head at (5,2), (3,2) is two left, so not adjacent directly. Adjacent cells are (4,2), (5,3), (5,1), (6,2) but (6,2) is body.\n> \n> (6,5) is another food.\n> \n> Also, need to think about the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is tail? Tail at (2,5). Head at (5,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |dx| + |dy| =1.\n> \n> From (5,2) to (2,5): dx=3, dy=3, not adjacent.

U is blocked by body.\n> \n> But let's confirm snake positions: head (5,2), body: (6,2) at index 1, (6,3) at 2, (5,3) at 3. So (5,3) is occupied, yes.\n> \n> So from (5,2), moving U to (5,3) is into body, collision.\n> \n> Moving D to (5,1): let's see if (5,1) is valid. Coordinates: x=5, y=1. Walls: y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not wall, x=5 between 0 and 7. Obstacles: (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, so (5,1) is different, not obstacle. So (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (4,2): x=4,y=2, not wall, not obstacle, not snake body except head is moving away.\n> \n> Current snake occupies (5,2), but when we move head to (4,2), the body will follow, so (5,2) becomes part of body, but (4,2) is new head position.\n> \n> (4,2) is not currently occupied, so it should be safe.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,2) is on the way if I go left.\n> \n> (3,2) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 33, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 37? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span 1, it disappears at the end of turn t, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n> \n> If life span 2, at turn t, countdown 2, decreases to 1 on next turn, disappears after that, so can be eaten on turn t or t+1.\n> \n> Generally, with life span L at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> Here, turn 33, food (3,2) life span 5, so can be eaten on turns 33,34,35,36,37? Disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> Turn t, life span L: present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> So for (3,2): at turn 33, life span 5, so available turns: 33,34,35,36 (since disappears after 37, so last chance on turn 37? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 33, countdown=5. After turn 33, countdown becomes 4; after turn 34, countdown 3; ... after turn 37, countdown 0, then it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 37? Turn 37 is when countdown decreases to 0, but before that, it's still there.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown is K at start of turn, it can be eaten during that turn, and at end of turn, countdown decreases.\n> \n> So for (3,2) at turn 33: countdown=5, can be eaten on turn 33. After turn 33, if not eaten, countdown=4.\n> \n> On turn 34, countdown=4, can be eaten, and so on, up to turn 37: countdown=1, can be eaten, after turn 37, countdown=0, disappears.\n> \n> So available turns: 33 to 37 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, food (6,5) life span 8, available from turn 33 to 40.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (5,2), I can move L to (4,2) or D to (5,1).\n> \n> If I move L to (4,2), I'm closer to food at (3,2). From (4,2), I can then move L to (3,2) to eat it, but (3,2) might have issues.\n> \n> (3,2) is a food position, but is it under snake body?

Tail was (2,5), and since no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed, so new tail is (2,6)?

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Also, internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (4,2), then body segments: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (4,2) from (5,2)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (4,2) <- head, then (5,2), which is to the right, so if head is at (4,2) and previous was (5,2), it moved left from (5,2) to (4,2). Head direction is L, so current movement direction is left.\n> \n> - Food:\n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 4\n> - (6,5) with value 1, life span 7\n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive since value is 1, and no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,2), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 34, it will disappear after turn 34 + 4 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t + L or something? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means that at the current turn, the countdown is L, and it decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, the food disappears. So for food with life span L at turn t, it will be present for L turns: from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - (3,2): life span 4, current turn 34, so it will disappear after turn 34 + 4 = 38? Countdown decreases each turn including current, so at turn 34, countdown=4; turn 35, countdown=3; turn 36, countdown=2; turn 37, countdown=1; turn 38, countdown=0, so it disappears at the beginning of turn 38 or after turn 37? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically in such games, food is present at the start of the turn, and if eaten during the turn, it's consumed. Disappearance might happen at the end of the turn or start.\n> \n> But for planning, I should assume that the food is available until the turn when countdown reaches 0. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t with life span L, after that turn, the countdown becomes L-1 for the next turn, and so on. When countdown is 1, it is present for that turn, and after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (3,2): life span 4 at turn 34. So:\n> \n> - Turn 34: countdown=4, present\n> \n> - Turn 35: countdown=3, present\n> \n> - Turn 36: countdown=2, present\n> \n> - Turn 37: countdown=1, present\n> \n> - Turn 38: countdown=0, not present\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): life span 7, so present until turn 34+7-1=40? Turn 34: countdown=7, present; turn 35:6; ... turn 40:1, present; turn 41:0, gone. Since it decreases each turn, from 7 to 1 over 7 turns? Start at turn 34 with countdown=7, after turn 34, countdown=6 for turn 35; after turn 35, countdown=5 for turn 36; ... after turn 40, countdown=0, so gone at turn 41.\n> \n> Let's define: at the start of turn T, food has remaining life span R. After the turn, R decreases by 1. If R was 1 before the turn, after the turn it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given as life span at current turn, which is the initial countdown.\n> \n> For simplicity, I'll assume that food with life span L at turn t is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For (3,2): L=4, t=34, available turns 34,35,36,37. Gone at 38.\n> \n> (6,5): L=7, t=34, available turns 34 to 40. Gone at 41.\n> \n> (3,5): L=10, t=34, available turns 34 to 43. Gone at 44.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction L.

Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So cannot move right immediately.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2): U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but R is opposite, not allowed. So only U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,1) is y=1, which is not border, y=0 is border.

For the food at (3,5) to be eatable, we need to have the tail at (3,5) and then move the head to (3,5) after that, but when tail is at (3,5), moving head to (3,5) would cause collision since head touches body, but it's the tail, but in snake, when head moves to the tail position, it is safe if the tail moves away at the same time, but in standard rules, if head moves to the cell that the tail is leaving, it is safe, because tail moves first or simultaneously.\n> \n> In this game, the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So it is safe to move to the tail cell if the tail is moving away.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (3,5), it is currently occupied, so to eat it, we need to move the snake such that the segment on (3,5) moves away, and then later head moves to (3,5).\n> \n> But as above, when the segment moves away, another segment moves in, so it never free until the tail is there.\n> \n> So (3,5) will be free only when the tail is at (3,5) and we move without eating, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Currently, the body segment at (3,5) is index 8.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the tail will be at the position of index (10 - k) or something.\n> \n> Old indices: let S be list, S[10] is tail.\n> \n> After one move no eat, new tail is at old S[9] position.\n> \n> After two moves, new tail at old S[8] position, etc.\n> \n> So after two moves without eating, the tail will be at the position that was S[8] at turn 34, which is (3,5).\n> \n> At turn 34, S[8] = (3,5)\n> \n> After one move no eat at turn 35, tail is at old S[9] = (3,6)\n> \n> After two moves no eat at turn 36, tail is at old S[8] = (3,5)\n> \n> Then at turn 36, tail is at (3,5), so if at turn 36 we move without eating, tail moves away, and (3,5) is vacated, so food is available at (3,5) for eating at turn 36 or later, until life span.\n> \n> Life span of (3,5) is 10, so available until turn 43, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> But let's focus on immediate choices.\n> \n> Back to turn 34, from (4,2), options: U, D, L.\n> \n> L to (3,2): eat food, grow to 12, head at (3,2), direction L.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves U to (3,3) or L to (2,2), since D to (3,1) is wall.\n> \n> U to (3,3): free cell.\n> \n> L to (2,2): free cell.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (3,2), the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but we get +1 score.\n> \n> But we need to consider risks.\n> \n> Also, there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, at (3,2), tail is at (2,6), not adjacent, so no issue.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a cell or orthogonally adjacent?

Or turn t + L?\n> \n> Example: if at turn t, life_span N, then after N turns, it has been N turns, so at turn t+N, it is gone. Since countdown decreases each turn, starting from N at turn t, to N-1 at t+1, ..., to 0 at t+N, and when countdown 0, it disappears, so on turn t+N, it is not there.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N, so it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1, I think.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is N, so it is present.\n> \n> After turn t, at start of turn t+1, countdown decreases to N-1, and so on, until countdown 0 at turn t+N, when it disappears before the turn or during? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life_span L, it can be eaten until turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and disappears after that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, here at turn 35, (6,5) has life_span 6, so it can be eaten on turns 35 to 40, and disappears at turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) has life_span 9, so turns 35 to 43.\n> \n> Now, to eat (6,5), we need to reach it by turn 40.\n> \n> From (3,2), min moves to (6,5) is 6, but with obstacles, let's find a path.\n> \n> Also, the snake body will move, so the grid changes.\n> \n> Since we need to think 5+ turns, let's simulate possible moves.\n> \n> First, I need to choose an action for turn 35.\n> \n> Options: L or U.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,3), that might be towards the center.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,2), then I can go up from there.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food at (3,5). It's on the body, at segment (3,5), which is part of the snake.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake needs to move so that (3,5) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is occupied by segment 9. When the snake moves, the tail will move first if head doesn't eat food.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away from current position.\n> \n> At turn 35, tail is at (2,6).\n> \n> If snake moves without eating, tail moves to the next position based on the body.\n> \n> The snake moves: head to new position, then each segment moves to the previous position of the one ahead.\n> \n> So after one move, the tail will be at the position of the second last segment.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to new position, say from (3,2) to (3,3) U, then new positions: head (3,3), then body: segment 1 moves to old head (3,2), segment 2 to old seg1 (4,2), ..., up to tail: the second last is (3,6), which was segment 10, moves to where segment 9 was, but segment 9 is (3,5), so (3,6) moves to (3,5)?

It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So these are cells the snake can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: The snake is a list of segments from head to tail. Head is at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). That's 12 segments, so the snake is 12 units long.\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which means it's moving left. So last move was to the left, to (2,2) from previous position.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including this one, so by turn 40.\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Disappears after 8 turns, by turn 43.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I should sketch this out.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, indices from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: borders are all around, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,2)\n> \n> Body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n> \n> Tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Now, food: (6,5) and (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is also a body segment? Snake has (3,5) in its positions. Let's list snake segments:\n> \n> Index: 0: (2,2) head\n> \n> 1: (3,2)\n> \n> 2: (4,2)\n> \n> 3: (5,2)\n> \n> 4: (6,2)\n> \n> 5: (6,3)\n> \n> 6: (5,3)\n> \n> 7: (5,4)\n> \n> 8: (4,4)\n> \n> 9: (3,4)\n> \n> 10: (3,5)\n> \n> 11: (3,6) tail\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is exactly where segment 10 is. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,5) is not occupied by snake right now.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so moving left. Last move was to (2,2) from (3,2), I assume.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head is at (2,2) and direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn because that would be directly opposite to the current movement.\n> \n> Current head direction is given as L, meaning the snake was moving left to get to (2,2). So for the next move, I can choose U, D, or L, but not R, because R is opposite to L.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,3)\n> \n> - D: (2,1)\n> \n> - L: (1,2)\n> \n> - R: (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by body, so not possible anyway, and also opposite direction, so forbidden.\n> \n> (3,2) is the first body segment, so it's occupied, so moving R is invalid regardless of direction.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are free around (2,2):\n> \n> - Up: (2,3) – is this wall or obstacle? y=3, x=2. Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,3) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (2,3) not in that list, so should be free, but might be occupied by snake or something.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n> \n> So (2,3) is not in this list, so it's free.\n> \n> (2,1): not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle? (2,1): x=2,y=1. Internal obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (2,1) not listed, so should be free. But y=1, not border, not internal obstacle listed, so free.\n> \n> (1,2): x=1,y=2. Not border, not in internal obstacles, not snake, so free.\n> \n> (3,2) is snake, occupied.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,3)\n> \n> - D to (2,1)\n> \n> - L to (1,2)\n> \n> R is invalid and occupied.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and risks.\n> \n> Food at (6,5) and (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is currently occupied by the snake body (segment 10), and it has food with value 1, life span 8. Since it's under the body, I can eat it only if the body moves away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is free, but I need to get there.\n> \n> Also, life spans: (6,5) disappears after 5 turns, so by turn 40. Current turn 36, so it has 5 turns left? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 36, life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns, so on turn 41 it's gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it lasts from turn t to turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, if at turn t=36, life_span=5, then:\n> \n> - Turn 36: life_span 5\n> \n> - Turn 37: life_span 4\n> \n> - Turn 38: life_span 3\n> \n> - Turn 39: life_span 2\n> \n> - Turn 40: life_span 1\n> \n> - Turn 41: life_span 0, disappears.\n> \n> So food at (6,5) is available from turn 36 to 40, inclusive? Turn 36: life_span=5, so it can be eaten until turn 40, and disappears on turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) life_span=8, so from turn 36 to 43, disappears turn 44.\n> \n> But (3,5) is under snake body, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> Now, the snake tail is at (3,6), and head is at (2,2), far away.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence to maximize score, so eating food when possible, but avoiding risks.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,6), and if there were food there, but currently no food at tail, food is at (3,5), which is not tail, it's segment 10.\n> \n> Tail is (3,6), which has no food mentioned.\n> \n> Food is at (3,5), which is a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Now, to eat (3,5), since it's under body, I need to move the snake so that (3,5) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,5).\n> \n> But (6,5) is free now.\n> \n> First, let's assess the immediate options.\n> \n> From head (2,2), I can go U, D, or L.\n> \n> - U: (2,3)\n> \n> - D: (2,1)\n> \n> - L: (1,2)\n> \n> Now, which one is safe?\n> \n> (2,3): let's see if it's occupied. Snake has (2,2), (3,2), etc., no (2,3), so free.\n> \n> (2,1): similarly, free.\n> \n> (1,2): free.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Also, walls: (2,3) is fine, (2,1) is fine, but (2,1) is close to obstacle? (3,1) is obstacle, but (2,1) is separate.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (3,1), which is below (3,2), but (2,1) is not obstacle.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food at (6,5). It's at (6,5), and snake body is at (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> (6,5) is above (6,4)? (6,4) is internal obstacle? Walls include (6,4) as internal obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So (6,4) is a wall, so (6,5) is above it, at (6,5).\n> \n> Snake has (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3), etc.\n> \n> To reach (6,5) from current head position (2,2), it's quite far: delta x=4, delta y=3, so at least 7 moves away, but with body, it might take more.\n> \n> But life span is 5, so if I start moving now, I might not reach in time if there are obstacles.\n> \n> From (2,2) to (6,5): one path could be right and up, but right is blocked by body at (3,2), and also direction constraint.\n> \n> I cannot move right immediately because of direction and occupation.\n> \n> But I can move up or down or left first.\n> \n> (6,5) is at x=6, y=5. Snake body at (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4) is wall, so (6,5) is accessible, but from which sides? (6,5) can be accessed from left, right, up, down, but:\n> \n> - Left: (5,5)\n> \n> - Right: (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Up: (6,6)\n> \n> - Down: (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible access to (6,5) is from left (5,5) or up (6,6) or down but down is wall, so only left or up.\n> \n> (5,5) or (6,6).\n> \n> (6,6) is y=6, which is not border? y=7 is border, so (6,6) is within bounds, no obstacle mentioned, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) should be free.\n> \n> Now, current snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), etc., no (5,5) or (6,6) occupied.\n> \n> So (6,5) can be eaten from (5,5) or (6,6).\n> \n> But to get there from (2,2), it's a long way.\n> \n> With only 5 turns left for this food, I might not reach it in time. Let's see minimum moves.\n> \n> From (2,2) to (6,5): min moves: need to increase x by 4, y by 3, so 7 moves, but with obstacles and body, it could be more.\n> \n> But turns: from turn 36, I can move on 36,37,38,39,40. If I eat on turn 40, it's possible, but life span decreases to 1 on turn 40, so I can eat on turn 40.\n> \n> But can I reach in 4 moves? (2,2) to (6,5) is |dx|=4, |dy|=3, so min 7 moves? No, since I move one cell per turn, the Manhattan distance is |dx| + |dy| = 4 + 3 = 7 moves.\n> \n> But I start moving at turn 36 to a new position.\n> \n> After moving on turn 36, head is at new position, then turn 37, etc.\n> \n> To reach (6,5) on turn t, I need to be at (6,5) at the start of turn t, after moving.\n> \n> Let's say on turn 36, I move from (2,2) to some place.\n> \n> Then turn 37, etc.\n> \n> The food is available until turn 40, meaning I can eat it on turn 40 if I move to it on turn 40.\n> \n> So I need to be at a cell adjacent to (6,5) on turn 39, and move to it on turn 40.\n> \n> But the distance from (2,2) to (6,5) is 7 in Manhattan distance, so to reach in 4 moves (turns 36,37,38,39 to be adjacent on 39), I need to cover 7 units in 4 moves, which is impossible since max per move is 1, so in 4 moves I can cover at most 4 units, but I need 7, so I can't reach (6,5) by turn 40.\n> \n> Manhattan distance is 4+3=7, and each move changes position by 1 in one direction.\n> \n> In k moves, I can reach any cell within Manhattan distance k.\n> \n> From (2,2) to (6,5), Δx=4, Δy=3, so Manhattan dist=7.\n> \n> On turn 36, after move, I am at a new position, say P36.\n> \n> Then turn 37, P37, and so on.\n> \n> To be at (6,5) on turn t, I need to arrive there on that turn.\n> \n> For example, on turn 40, I can move to (6,5).\n> \n> So I need to be at a neighbor of (6,5) on turn 39, so that on turn 40 I move to it.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 39, I need to be at one of (5,5), (6,6), or (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, so only (5,5) or (6,6).\n> \n> (7,5) is invalid.\n> \n> So on turn 39, I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6).\n> \n> Now, from (2,2) to (5,5): Δx=3, Δy=3, dist=6.\n> \n> To (6,6): Δx=4, Δy=4, dist=8.\n> \n> Better to aim for (5,5).\n> \n> From (2,2) to (5,5) in 3 moves?

These are cells the snake can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (2,3), then body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). That's 12 segments. So the snake is 12 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up, meaning (x,y+1). So from (2,3), moving up would go to (2,4), but let's see what's around.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if we don't eat it by turn 37 + 3 = 40, it's gone? Let's clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn starting from now. So at turn 37, life span 4, it will be gone after turn 40? Or on turn 41?\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it's gone. For example, at turn t, life span N; turn t+1, life span N-1; ... turn t+N-1, life span 1; then on turn t+N, it disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn t+N-1.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,5): at turn 37, life span 4, so it can be eaten on turns 37, 38, 39, 40. Disappears on turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) with value 1, life span 7. So available from turn 37 to 43 (since 37+6=43, disappear on 44).\n> \n> (4,1) with value 1, life span 10. Available longer.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But since head direction is U, I cannot instantly reverse to D. So not allowed to move down. So possible moves: U, L, R. But need to check for walls, obstacles, and body.\n> \n> Moving U: to (2,4). Is (2,4) occupied? Snake positions: (2,3) head, then (2,2), (3,2), etc. (2,4) is not in the list, but is it free?\n> \n> List all snake positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5).\n> \n> (2,4) is not in this list. Is it a wall? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7; internal (3,1), (2,4)? (2,4) is listed as an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)]\n> \n> (2,4) is an obstacle! So moving up to (2,4) is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> Moving left: from (2,3) to (1,3). Is (1,3) free? x=1, y=3. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x=1 is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,1) and (1,6), but (1,3) is not listed, so it should be free. Snake positions: no (1,3), so yes.\n> \n> Moving right: from (2,3) to (3,3). (3,3) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles are (3,1), etc., not (3,3)), so free.\n> \n> Moving down: but direction is U, so reverse to D is not allowed. So only L or R possible? U is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> Current head direction U, so cannot move down. Moves allowed: U, L, R. But U is to (2,4) which is obstacle, so invalid. So only L or R possible: left to (1,3) or right to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> Food locations: (6,5), (3,5), (4,1)\n> \n> (3,5) is a food, but look at snake positions: the tail is at (3,5), which is the last segment. Snake positions: head (2,3), ..., then (3,4), (3,5). So (3,5) is the tail, and it has food on it? Food positions include (3,5) with value 1.\n> \n> But there's a special rule: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is occupied by the tail, and it has food. So if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, and then head moves to (3,5), it can eat it.\n> \n> But also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Head at (2,3). Tail at (3,5). Are they adjacent? (2,3) and (3,5): delta x=1, delta y=2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells to head (2,3): (2,4) up, (2,2) down, (1,3) left, (3,3) right.\n> \n> (2,2) is the body, so not tail. Tail is (3,5), which is not adjacent to head.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, for the food at (3,5): since it's under the tail, we can only eat it if tail moves away first.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves and their outcomes.\n> \n> Current turn 37, head at (2,3), direction U.\n> \n> Options: L to (1,3) or R to (3,3).\n> \n> If I go left to (1,3): new head position (1,3), body follows, so the tail moves from (3,5) to ... let's simulate.\n> \n> Snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> So if head moves to (1,3), then new positions: head (1,3), then (2,3) becomes segment 1, (2,2) segment 2, and so on, up to (3,4) becomes the new tail? Current positions: index 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (3,4), 11: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (1,3):\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then segment 1: old head (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,2)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Segment 11: (3,4)  (since old segment 10 was (3,4), now becomes segment 11)\n> \n> - Old tail (3,5) is gone? When snake moves, the tail moves to the position of the second last segment if not eating, but since no food eaten, length same, so tail disappears from (3,5), and new tail is the previous segment 10, which was (3,4), so now tail at (3,4).\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)  new tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is still there, but now uncovered? Tail moved away, so (3,5) is free, and food is there, so if head moves to (3,5) later, it can eat.\n> \n> But head is now at (1,3), which is far.\n> \n> If I go right to (3,3): new head (3,3), then body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ..., up to (3,4) becomes tail? Old positions: after head to (3,3), segment 1: (2,3), segment 2: (2,2), segment 3: (3,2), ..., segment 10: (3,4), segment 11: (3,5) but since no eat, tail (3,5) gone, new tail at (3,4).\n> \n> So tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, (3,5) food is still there.\n> \n> But head is at (3,3), which is adjacent to (3,4) and (3,5)? (3,3) to (3,4) is down? y increases up? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume. So (x,y), U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), etc.\n> \n> So (3,3) to (3,4) is up, since y+1.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: up (3,4), down (3,2), left (2,3), right (4,3).\n> \n> (3,4) is the tail, which has no food? Food is at (3,5), which is up from (3,4).\n> \n> From (3,3), (3,4) is up, which is the tail position, but tail has no food; the food is at (3,5), which is one more up.\n> \n> But (3,5) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's two steps away.\n> \n> I need to think about paths to food.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (3,5). Since it's under the tail initially, but after one move, tail moves, so (3,5) is free with food.\n> \n> But to eat it, head needs to move to (3,5).\n> \n> Currently, head at (2,3), if I move right to (3,3), then head at (3,3). From there, I can move up to (3,4), but (3,4) is the new tail after move? After moving to (3,3), tail is at (3,4), as above.\n> \n> From (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by tail? When moving, if head moves to a cell, it's only deadly if it collides with body, but the tail is part of body, but there's a rule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to tail position is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,3), moving U to (3,4): (3,4) is current tail position. After move, head moves to (3,4), and tail moves away, so no collision. Then the food at (3,5) is still there? After this move, if I go to (3,4), then from there I can go to (3,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But let's sequence it.\n> \n> Turn 37: head at (2,3), direction U.\n> \n> Option: move R to (3,3).

(3,4) is current tail, but safe to move there because tail moves.\n> \n> After moving to (3,4), new head at (3,4), body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), etc., and tail moves from (3,4) to where? Old tail was (3,4)? After turn 37 move to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), ..., (3,4) is segment 10?

After move, the snake will move: head to (4,3), then body segments follow. The tail is at (3,4), which will move to the previous position of the second last segment, but since we're moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail cell is vacated, unless we eat food, then a new segment is added at tail.\n> \n> But for collision check, when head moves to a cell, it shouldn't be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, which will move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving to a cell, if that cell has a body segment other than the tail, it's collision.

No collision with other body parts.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D (down): from (3,3) to (3,2)\n> \n> (3,2) is currently occupied by a body segment.

No, Manhattan distance is the number of moves required if no obstacles.\n> \n> From (3,3) to (6,5): to increase x by 3 and y by 2, so 5 moves, but we can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal moves, each move changes x or y by 1.\n> \n> So to go from (3,3) to (6,5), need at least 3 moves in x and 2 in y, total 5 moves, but since we can only move one direction per turn, minimum number of moves is max(dx, dy) if we move diagonally, but we can't, so it's dx + dy if we move in a path.\n> \n> For example, move R, R, R, U, U: that's 5 moves.\n> \n> Or R, U, R, U, R: also 5 moves.\n> \n> But to reach in fewer moves? No, the shortest path is 5 moves since dx=3, dy=2.\n> \n> But we can reach in 3 moves if we move in a way that each move covers both, but no, each move only one step.\n> \n> For instance, after one move, at (4,3) or (3,4), after two moves, at (4,4) or (3,5) or (5,3) etc., after three moves, at (5,4) or (4,5) or (6,3), not (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) from (3,3) requires at least 3 moves in x-direction and 2 in y, so minimum 5 moves to reach.\n> \n> But on turn 38, we are at (3,3), so to be at (6,5) on turn 40, that's two moves later, impossible.\n> \n> Turn 38 start, move to new position on turn 38.\n> \n> After turn 38 move, at new position for turn 39.\n> \n> After turn 39 move, at new position for turn 40.\n> \n> So on turn 40, after two moves, we can be at most 2 cells away, like (5,3) or (4,4) or (3,5), not (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is 3 in x and 2 in y, so after 2 moves, we can cover at most 2 in x or 2 in y or one each, but not 3 in x and 2 in y.\n> \n> So indeed, impossible to reach (6,5) by turn 40.

Let's list positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (3,4), 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,4), 11: tail (4,4)\n> \n> If head moves right to (4,4): since (4,4) is tail, and no food, so head moves to (4,4), and tail is removed. The new head is at (4,4), and the body segments: the previous head (3,4) becomes the new neck, and so on, up to the segment before tail. Tail (4,4) is removed, but head is moving to it, so the new snake: positions [ (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] and tail is (5,4) now, since (5,4) was position 10, now position 11? Let's index.\n> \n> After move: head at (4,4), then the previous positions except tail is removed. So the segments: new head at (4,4), then the previous head (3,4) is now segment 1, then (3,3) seg2, (2,3) seg3, (2,2) seg4, (3,2) seg5, (4,2) seg6, (5,2) seg7, (6,2) seg8, (6,3) seg9, (5,3) seg10, and tail was (5,4) but (5,4) is now the new tail? Positions: after move, the body segments are the same except the tail is gone. So from index 0 to 10, but head moved to new position.\n> \n> Standard: the snake moves: head to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (4,4), then body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and the tail was (5,4), but since tail is removed, the new tail is (5,3), which was previously the 10th segment? List:\n> \n> Old positions: 0:(3,4) head, 1:(3,3), 2:(2,3), 3:(2,2), 4:(3,2), 5:(4,2), 6:(5,2), 7:(6,2), 8:(6,3), 9:(5,3), 10:(5,4), 11:(4,4) tail? I think I have 12 positions.\n> \n> Count: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] — that's 12 cells, indices 0 to 11, head=0, tail=11.\n> \n> After moving right to (4,4): head moves to (4,4), which was tail. Since no food, tail is removed. So new head at (4,4), then the segments 0 to 10 become the body, but shifted: segment 1 moves to where head was, etc.\n> \n> New positions: head at new position (4,4), then the previous head (3,4) becomes segment 1, previous segment 1 (3,3) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to previous segment 10 (5,4) becomes segment 11, and previous tail (4,4) is gone. But since head moved to (4,4), and (4,4) was tail, it's occupied.\n> \n> After move: the cell (4,4) is occupied by head, and the segments from 0 to 10 are shifted: new segment 1 is old position 0 (3,4), new segment 2 is old position 1 (3,3), ..., new segment 11 is old position 10 (5,4). Old tail position 11 (4,4) is now head, so no longer tail.\n> \n> So new snake: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) and tail at (5,4). So length decreased by one? No, length should be the same since no food eaten.\n> \n> Old length 12, after move with no food, length should be 11 or 12? In snake game, when no food, length stays the same, tail is removed.\n> \n> Old positions 12 cells. After move: head to new cell, tail removed, so 11 cells. New head at (4,4), then 11 body segments from old 0 to 10, but old 0 is now first body, old 1 to 10 are body, so 11 segments total: head + 10 body? Let's count.\n> \n> New positions: [ (4,4) head, then (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] and tail is (5,3)? Old segment 10 is (5,4), which is now the new tail at (5,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves one step forward.\n> \n> Head moves to new cell. If no food, the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So the new head position is the new cell.\n> \n> The new body positions are the previous head position, and each subsequent body position moves to the previous one's position.\n> \n> So for a snake with positions P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk (P0 head, Pk tail).\n> \n> After moving to new head position P_new:\n> \n> - New head: P_new\n> \n> - New body: P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}  (if no food, tail Pk is removed)\n> \n> So new positions: [P_new, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}]\n> \n> Length is k, same as before if no food; if food, length k+1 with positions [P_new, P0, P1, ..., Pk]\n> \n> In this case, old: P0=(3,4), P1=(3,3), ..., P11=(4,4)\n> \n> Move to P_new = (4,4), which is old P11.\n> \n> No food, so new positions: head (4,4), then P0=(3,4), P1=(3,3), P2=(2,3), P3=(2,2), P4=(3,2), P5=(4,2), P6=(5,2), P7=(6,2), P8=(6,3), P9=(5,3), P10=(5,4)  and P11 is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]? That's 12 positions, but P10 is (5,4), and head is (4,4), so positions: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — 12 segments, but since no food, it should be 11 or 12?\n> \n> I think I have a off-by-one error.\n> \n> Old snake: 12 segments, indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> After moving to new cell with no food: new head at new cell, new body segments 0 to 10, so 11 segments.\n> \n> New head: (4,4)\n> \n> New segment 1: old P0 (3,4)\n> \n> New segment 2: old P1 (3,3)\n> \n> New segment 3: old P2 (2,3)\n> \n> New segment 4: old P3 (2,2)\n> \n> New segment 5: old P4 (3,2)\n> \n> New segment 6: old P5 (4,2)\n> \n> New segment 7: old P6 (5,2)\n> \n> New segment 8: old P7 (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 9: old P8 (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 10: old P9 (5,3)\n> \n> New segment 11: old P10 (5,4)  // this is the new tail\n> \n> Old P11 (4,4) is now head, so not part of body anymore.\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,4), then body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4)\n> \n> So 11 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move up to (3,5), and eat food, new head at (3,5), new positions: head (3,5), then old P0 (3,4), P1 (3,3), ..., up to P11 (4,4), so 13 segments.\n> \n> Back to the decision.\n> \n> At turn 39, from (3,4), I can:\n> \n> - Move U to (3,5): eat food, grow to 13 segments, and head now at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> - Move R to (4,4): no food, shrink to 11 segments? Length unchanged, but since no food, length decreases only if it was about to grow or something? No, in snake, when no food eaten, length stays the same, but tail moves, so the number of segments is the same, but positions change.\n> \n> In this case, after moving right, length is 11, down from 12, because tail was removed.\n> \n> But in terms of segments, yes, length decreased by 1 since no food.\n> \n> But initially length was 12, after move with no food, length 11.\n> \n> After move with food, length 13.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 39, choices:\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (3,5) - eat food, score +1, new head (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> Then the food at (3,5) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Option 2: Move R to (4,4) - no food, new head (4,4), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,5) with life_span 2, so only available on turn 39 and 40.

It's turn 40, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). So, these are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (4,4)\n> \n> There are 13 segments? Positions list has 13 elements: from (3,5) to (4,4), that's 13 positions. Let's count: indices 0 to 12, so 13 segments.

So for food at (6,5) with life span 1 on turn 40, it will be gone by turn 41. So to eat it, I must be on (6,5) on turn 40.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) with value 1, life span 7. So it has 7 turns left, including turn 40, so it will disappear after turn 46? Let's see: on turn 40, life span is 7, so after 7 turns, on turn 47 it disappears? Countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> Assume turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, L decreases by 1. So on turn t, if L=1, after turn t, it disappears.

Last position is (4,4), which is the tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if I eat food, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (6,5): value 1, life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> - (4,1): value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All positive.\n> \n> Now, (6,5) is at (6,5), which is near the head. Head is at (3,5), so same y, x=6.\n> \n> Distance: from (3,5) to (6,5), I can go right twice? But I need to get there this turn to eat it.\n> \n> Current turn 40, head at (3,5), I need to move to (6,5) to eat the food at (6,5). But moving from (3,5) to (6,5) requires moving right multiple times, but I can only move one step per turn.\n> \n> This turn, turn 40, I can move to one adjacent cell.\n> \n> From (3,5), adjacent cells: Up: (3,6), but y=6? y from 1 to 6, y=6 is not wall? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is valid? Border cells y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is valid, not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=6 is valid.\n> \n> So from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) – is it free? No obstacles at (3,6), and not wall, so should be free. But is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Snake: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> So (3,6) is not in the list, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, Down: (3,4) – but that's the first body segment, occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> Left: (2,5) – not in snake positions, and not obstacle or wall? (2,5): x=2,y=5, should be free? Obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) – (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,5) is not obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, Right: (4,5) – not in snake or obstacles, should be free.\n> \n> But internal obstacles are given, so (4,5) is free.\n> \n> Also, Down is (3,4) occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5). D not possible because occupied and also reverse direction not allowed? Reverse direction: current direction is U, so Down is reverse, not allowed even if free, but here it's occupied anyway.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction, so D is invalid regardless.\n> \n> So choices: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,5) must be eaten this turn to get it. But (6,5) is three steps away: from (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5), but I need to be there on this turn? I can't, because I can only move one step per turn. On turn 40, I can move to (3,6), (2,5), or (4,5), none of which is (6,5). So I cannot eat the food at (6,5) on turn 40; it's impossible to reach it this turn.\n> \n> Distance is |6-3| + |5-5| = 3, so minimum 3 turns away, but since I move one step per turn, I can reach it at earliest on turn 42 if I move right each time, but on turn 40, I move to (4,5) or something, but (6,5) will be gone after turn 40, so I cannot eat it at all. It disappears after this turn.\n> \n> Life span: on turn 40, life span 1, so if not eaten during turn 40, it disappears. Since head is not on (6,5) now, and I can't move there this turn, it will be gone. So I should forget about this food; it's not achievable.\n> \n> Okay, so food at (6,5) is not reachable this turn and will disappear.\n> \n> Now, other food: (4,1) and (6,6).\n> \n> (4,1) is at (4,1), which is near the bottom-left, but (4,1) – is it blocked? Obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed, so should be free? Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), etc., (4,1) not there, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is free.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,5), I need to plan moves.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (4,4), which is adjacent? (3,5) to (4,4) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent are same row or column, differ by 1.\n> \n> (3,5) adjacent: (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5) – (4,4) is not adjacent, it's diagonal, so not directly adjacent.\n> \n> But later, when moving, I need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Now, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for visualization.\n> \n> Grid rows y from 1 to 6, columns x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (1,1) blocked\n> \n> - (1,6) blocked\n> \n> - (2,4) blocked\n> \n> - (3,1) blocked\n> \n> - (6,4) blocked\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> Tail: (4,4)\n> \n> Food: (4,1) and (6,6)\n> \n> (4,1) is at bottom, y=1, (6,6) at top-right.\n> \n> Life span: (4,1) has life span 7, so available until turn 46 included? On turn 40, life span 7, so after turn 40, it decreases to 6 on turn 41, etc., so it can be eaten on turns 40 to 46 inclusive. Disappears after turn 46, so last chance to eat is turn 46.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 10, available turns 40 to 49.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, immediate move on turn 40.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U: to (3,6) – is it free?

Up means increasing y, so from (3,6), moving Up would go to (3,7). But y=7 is a wall, so moving Up is not possible? Let's check.\n> \n> y=7 is a border wall, so (3,7) is a wall cell. Therefore, moving Up to (3,7) is impossible; it would be a wall collision.\n> \n> Current head direction is Up, but from (3,5) to (3,6), which is increasing y, so Up. But now at (3,6), if it moves Up to (3,7), that's a wall.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head direction is Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be instant reverse.

So when snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail becomes free, but other body cells are occupied.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that if it moves to the current tail position, it might be ok if the tail moves.\n> \n> Standard snake: if head moves to the cell that was the tail, it's ok because tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But here, the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). That's 13 segments. Head direction is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food: two items. First at (4,1) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food). Second at (6,6) with life span 8 and value +1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders are walls, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> (1,1) is an obstacle, but y=0 and x=0 are borders, so (1,1) might be internal. Similarly others.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7? No, borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so corners are included.\n> \n> But internal obstacles are additional.\n> \n> In the state, it says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Plus internal: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> (1,1) has x=1,y=1, not border, so it's an internal obstacle. Similarly, (1,6) with y=6, not 0 or 7, so internal. (6,4) same.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (4,6), direction right. So it can move to (5,6), (4,5), or (4,7)? But y=7 is wall, so (4,7) is invalid. Let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,6)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (x,y+1) = (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (x,y-1) = (4,5)\n> \n> - Left: (x-1,y) = (3,6)\n> \n> - Right: (x+1,y) = (5,6)\n> \n> But (3,6) is occupied by the body, which is the first body segment. Rule: moving into body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail and we're moving into it, but only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's collision unless that segment is the tail and the snake is moving such that the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), etc. So (3,6) is the first body segment, not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3), according to the list: positions are [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] so tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Now, for move left to (3,6): (3,6) is occupied by the body, and it's not the tail, so moving there would cause collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (4,5): is (4,5) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). (4,5) is not in this list, so it should be free, unless wall or obstacle.\n> \n> (4,5): x=4,y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles, so should be free.\n> \n> Moving right to (5,6): (5,6) not in snake positions, not wall? x=5,y=6, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,6) is within bounds, not wall. Internal obstacles don't include it, so free.\n> \n> Moving up to (4,7): y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite direction. Current direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). But moving left might be invalid anyway due to body.\n> \n> Possible actions at turn 42:\n> \n> - U: invalid, wall\n> \n> - D: (4,5), which is free\n> \n> - L: (3,6), but occupied by body (segment 1), so collision\n> \n> - R: (5,6), free\n> \n> So only possible moves are D (down) or R (right).\n> \n> Now, food: (4,1) with life span 6, value +1; and (6,6) with life span 8, value +1.\n> \n> (6,6) is at x=6,y=6, which is near the head. Head at (4,6), so (6,6) is two steps right? From (4,6) to (5,6) to (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) might be reachable.\n> \n> (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is far down.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,1), life span 6, current turn 42, so it disappears after 6 turns, meaning it will disappear at the start of turn 48? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the turn when it is present, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, including the current turn when we act.\n> \n> In state, it says for (4,1): life span 6, so at turn 42, life span is 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, so on turn 43, life span becomes 5, and so on, until turn 47 it has life span 1, and on turn 48 it disappears, I think. Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 42, it has 6, after turn 42, it has 5, and so on, so it exists as long as life span > 0. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N, it appears and lasts for N turns, including the turn it was spawned or from current.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 42, life span 6, so it will be there for turns 42,43,44,45,46,47, and disappear at turn 48.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 8, so from turn 42 to 49, disappear at turn 50.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,6), moving to either (4,5) or (5,6) this turn.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move down to (4,5)\n> \n> Then snake positions: head moves to (4,5), tail moves? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail segment is removed unless we eat food.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> After moving down to (4,5), new head at (4,5), then body: previous head was (4,6), so now segment 1 at (4,6), segment 2 at (3,6), segment 3 at (3,5), and so on, down to tail at (6,3)?

No.\n> \n> When moving, the new head is at the new position, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So new positions: head: (4,5)\n> \n> Then segment 1: old position of head (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 2: old position of segment 1 (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 3: old position of segment 2 (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 4: old position of segment 3 (3,4)\n> \n> Segment 5: old position of segment 4 (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 6: old position of segment 5 (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 7: old position of segment 6 (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 8: old position of segment 7 (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 9: old position of segment 8 (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 10: old position of segment 9 (5,2)\n> \n> Segment 11: old position of segment 10 (6,2)\n> \n> Segment 12: old position of segment 11 (6,3) — and the old tail (5,3) is no longer part of snake, so cell (5,3) is vacated.\n> \n> So snake now: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n> \n> Length still 13, no food eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, if move right to (5,6), head to (5,6), then body: segment 1 to (4,6), segment 2 to (3,6), etc., down to segment 12 to old segment 11 (6,3), tail vacates (5,3).\n> \n> Snake: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n> \n> Now, food: (6,6) is at (6,6), which is near.

I need to clarify the growth.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Thus, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, and the body segments from 1 to n remain, but the tail stays, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> In this case, before move to (6,6): snake at [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)]\n> \n> After move to (6,6) and eat: head to (6,6), then the body: since eating, the tail doesn't move, so segments: head (6,6), segment 1: (5,6), segment 2: (4,6), segment 3: (3,6), segment 4: (3,5), segment 5: (3,4), segment 6: (3,3), segment 7: (2,3), segment 8: (2,2), segment 9: (3,2), segment 10: (4,2), segment 11: (5,2), segment 12: (6,2), and since eating, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (6,3), so segment 13: (6,3), and tail is still (6,3), but now there are two segments at (6,3)? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the head moves to the new position, the body segments each move to the next position, but since eating, the tail does not advance, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is created at the old tail position for that turn.\n> \n> Standard: positions before move: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg_k, tail]\n> \n> After moving and eating: new head at new position, new seg1 at old head position, new seg2 at old seg1 position, ..., new seg_k at old seg_k position, and new tail at old tail position (since tail didn't move).\n> \n> So the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, before move: indices: 0:head (5,6), 1:seg1 (4,6), 2:seg2 (3,6), 3:seg3 (3,5), 4:seg4 (3,4), 5:seg5 (3,3), 6:seg6 (2,3), 7:seg7 (2,2), 8:seg8 (3,2), 9:seg9 (4,2), 10:seg10 (5,2), 11:seg11 (6,2), 12:tail (6,3)\n> \n> After move to (6,6) and eat: new head: (6,6)\n> \n> New seg1: old head (5,6)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (4,6)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 (3,6)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 (3,5)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 (3,4)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 (3,3)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6 (2,3)\n> \n> New seg8: old seg7 (2,2)\n> \n> New seg9: old seg8 (3,2)\n> \n> New seg10: old seg9 (4,2)\n> \n> New seg11: old seg10 (5,2)\n> \n> New seg12: old seg11 (6,2)\n> \n> And since eating, new tail segment at old tail position (6,3), so new seg13: (6,3)\n> \n> Thus tail at (6,3), but now (6,3) is occupied, and the snake has 14 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if no eat, tail would have moved to old seg11 position.\n> \n> But here, we eat, so tail stays.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (6,6), head at (6,6), which is near the wall.\n> \n> x=6, y=6, walls at x=7 and y=7, so (7,6) and (6,7) are walls, but (6,6) is safe for now.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,6): U (6,7) wall, invalid; D (6,5); L (5,6); R (7,6) wall, invalid.\n> \n> (5,6) is now body segment, seg1, so moving left to (5,6) would be collision.\n> \n> (6,5) might be free.\n> \n> First, is (6,5) occupied?

It's turn 43, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the grid is 8x8 cells, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,5), and the body segments follow: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). So the tail is at (6,3). The head direction is Down, which is decreasing y since D is (x,y-1). In coordinates, moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I must prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize. I'll sketch an 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? But x=0 and x=7 are boundaries, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, meaning we can't occupy them. The grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y are walls. So playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, so if x=0 and x=7 are walls, and similarly for y, then the inner grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> For example, (0,0) to (0,7) all walls, (7,0) to (7,7) walls, (0,0) to (7,0) walls, (0,7) to (7,7) walls. So yes, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so a 6x6 grid? x=1 to 6 is 6 values, y=1 to 6, so 6x6 cells.\n> \n> But let's see the snake positions: head at (4,5), which is within 1-6 for both x and y? x=4, y=5, yes. Tail at (6,3), etc.\n> \n> Also obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) is a corner, but since borders are walls, (1,1) might be playable? No, borders are walls, meaning cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. (1,1) has x=1, y=1, both not 0 or 7, so it should be playable, but it's listed as an internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) has y=6, which is not 0 or 7? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable, but (1,6) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> - Border walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) — these are additional walls inside the grid.\n> \n> So playable cells are all (x,y) where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, except those occupied by obstacles.\n> \n> Now obstacles: (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> And borders are walls, so no issue.\n> \n> Now snake: positions list: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)]\n> \n> Head at (4,5), direction Down. Down means moving to (x,y-1), so from (4,5) down would be to (4,4), but let's see what's possible.\n> \n> First, I need to find possible moves from current head position (4,5) with direction Down.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R but cannot reverse instantly. Current direction is D, so reverse would be U. So I cannot move Up next, because that would be opposite to Down.\n> \n> Allowed moves: since current direction is D, I can move D (same), L (left), or R (right), but not U (up).\n> \n> Now, check what cells are around (4,5):\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) — but (4,6) is occupied by the snake body, it's the second segment. Snake positions: index 0: head (4,5), index 1: (4,6), index 2: (3,6), etc.\n> \n> So (4,6) is a body segment, so moving to (4,6) would cause collision, but since the snake is moving, we need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> General rule: moving into a cell occupied by the body is deadly, except if it's the tail and the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, when the head moves, the tail also moves at the same time, I assume. So if the head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it's ok because the tail moves forward, leaving that cell empty.\n> \n> But here, (4,6) is not the tail; it's the second segment. The tail is (6,3).\n> \n> List of positions: indices from 0 to 12, I think. Let's count: positions given: 13 positions? From (4,5) to (6,3), that's 13 cells? Let's list:\n> \n> 0: (4,5) head\n> \n> 1: (4,6)\n> \n> 2: (3,6)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,4)\n> \n> 5: (3,3)\n> \n> 6: (2,3)\n> \n> 7: (2,2)\n> \n> 8: (3,2)\n> \n> 9: (4,2)\n> \n> 10: (5,2)\n> \n> 11: (6,2)\n> \n> 12: (6,3) tail\n> \n> Yes, 13 segments.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U) to (4,6): but (4,6) is occupied by segment 1. Since segment 1 will move to where the head was, but when the head moves to (4,6), at that moment, segment 1 is still there, so it would collide unless it's the tail. But segment 1 is not the tail; tail is segment 12. So moving to (4,6) would cause head to hit body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, Down (D) to (4,4): what is (4,4)? Is it free? Let's see the positions: (4,5) head, (3,5) is segment 3, (4,6) segment 1, etc. (4,4) is not in the list, so it should be free, but we need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: (4,4) is x=4,y=4, which is within 1-6, not a border wall. Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) — (4,4) not among them, so (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> Left (L) to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied by segment 3. Segment 3 is not tail, so moving there would collide.\n> \n> Right (R) to (5,5): not in snake positions, not wall or obstacle? x=5,y=5, should be free. Walls: x=5 between 1-6, y=5 between 1-6, not border. Obstacles don't include (5,5), so free.\n> \n> But current direction is D, and I cannot move U, which is reverse. U is not allowed because reverse, and also occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - D to (4,4): free, possible\n> \n> - L to (3,5): occupied by body, not safe\n> \n> - R to (5,5): free, possible\n> \n> U is not possible because reverse and occupied.\n> \n> So only D and R are possible moves? L is to (3,5) which is body, so not safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the collision rule: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies unless it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (3,5) is segment 3, which is body, not tail. Tail is (6,3). So moving to (3,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is segment 1, collision.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Down to (4,4) or Right to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (4,1), (6,6), (2,6).\n> \n> (4,1) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 43, life span 5, so it will be there for turns 43,44,45,46,47, and disappear after that, so available until turn 47? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> Here t=43, life span 5, so food at (4,1) will disappear after turn 43 + 5 = 48? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 43, life span 5, so after this turn, life span becomes 4 at turn 44, then 3 at 45, 2 at 46, 1 at 47, and at turn 48 it should be gone, so it can be eaten until turn 47 inclusive? I think so.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 7, disappears after turn 43+7=50.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 10, disappears after 43+10=53.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions.\n> \n> First, let's see the current position and possible paths.\n> \n> The snake is long, 13 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Playable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, with obstacles at (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> So let's list free cells.\n> \n> But also, some cells have food.\n> \n> Food at (4,1), (6,6), (2,6)\n> \n> (4,1) is near the bottom, but y=1 is not wall, but (3,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) should be accessible?

And tail was (6,2), which is removed, so snake has 12 segments now? Original 13 segments, move to empty cell, so length same, tail removed.\n> \n> Original positions: 13 cells. Move head to (4,3), which is empty, so no food, so tail (6,2) is removed, new positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] so still 13? No: the list should be head new position, then all previous positions except tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake: head moves to new cell, if no food, tail cell is vacated, so the new body includes all previous body except the tail is removed.\n> \n> So previous snake: positions index 0 to 12: 0:head (4,4), 1:(4,5), 2:(4,6), 3:(3,6), 4:(3,5), 5:(3,4), 6:(3,3), 7:(2,3), 8:(2,2), 9:(3,2), 10:(4,2), 11:(5,2), 12:tail (6,2)\n> \n> After move down to (4,3): new head (4,3), then body: previous head (4,4) becomes new segment 1, then (4,5) seg2, (4,6) seg3, (3,6) seg4, (3,5) seg5, (3,4) seg6, (3,3) seg7, (2,3) seg8, (2,2) seg9, (3,2) seg10, (4,2) seg11, (5,2) seg12, and tail was (6,2) removed, so no seg13. So new positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] but (5,2) is now the tail, and there are 13 segments? From head to tail: 13 cells listed, but since tail was removed, it should be 12 segments.\n> \n> Let's count: new head (4,3), then the first body is (4,4), which was previous head, then (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). That's 12 positions: indices 0 to 11, with tail at (5,2). Original had 13, after move with no food, length decreases? No, in snake, when you don't eat, the length stays the same, but the tail moves, so one cell is vacated.\n> \n> I think I confused myself.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: the snake has a fixed length unless it eats food. When the head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell is empty, the head occupies it, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake moves forward, length unchanged.\n> \n> - If the new cell has food, the head occupies it, food is eaten, tail does not move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions, for no food: new head position, then the previous head to the second last body segment, and the tail is removed from the list.\n> \n> For example, from positions [A (head), B, C, D (tail)]\n> \n> Move to new cell E (empty): new positions [E (head), A, B, C] and D is removed, so length same.\n> \n> If E has food, new positions [E (head), A, B, C, D] but D was tail, now it stays, so new tail is C or something, but D is kept, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, original snake: head (4,4), then body segments (4,5) to (6,2), 12 body segments? Positions list has 13 elements: head and 12 body? Let's count: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] that's 13 positions, so snake length 13, head at index 0, tail at index 12.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,3) with no food: new head (4,3), then the first body is previous head (4,4), then the next bodies are from index 1 to 11 of previous: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and the tail (6,2) is removed, so new positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] but that's 13 positions again? No: the list should have 12 positions because tail was removed.\n> \n> Previous positions: 13 cells.\n> \n> New head: (4,3)\n> \n> Then new body: previous head becomes new body segment 1: (4,4)\n> \n> Previous body segment 1 becomes new body segment 2: (4,5)\n> \n> Previous body segment 2: (4,6)\n> \n> Previous body segment 3: (3,6)\n> \n> ...\n> Up to previous body segment 11: (5,2)  // (5,2) was at index 11, which is the second last, since index 12 is tail.\n> \n> Previous: index 0: head (4,4), index 1: (4,5), index 2: (4,6), index 3: (3,6), index 4: (3,5), index 5: (3,4), index 6: (3,3), index 7: (2,3), index 8: (2,2), index 9: (3,2), index 10: (4,2), index 11: (5,2), index 12: tail (6,2)\n> \n> After move to (4,3) no food: new head: (4,3)\n> \n> New body segments: the previous segments from index 0 to 11 become the new body segments 1 to 12, but since no food, tail is removed, so we keep previous indices 0 to 11 as new body segments 1 to 12, but index 0 is previous head, which is now body, and index 12 is tail which is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: new head (4,3), then previous index 0: (4,4), previous index 1: (4,5), previous index 2: (4,6), previous index 3: (3,6), previous index 4: (3,5), previous index 5: (3,4), previous index 6: (3,3), previous index 7: (2,3), previous index 8: (2,2), previous index 9: (3,2), previous index 10: (4,2), previous index 11: (5,2)\n> \n> And previous index 12: (6,2) is removed.\n> \n> So new list: head (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — that's 13 positions? New head plus 12 bodies, but the last body is (5,2), which was previous index 11, and tail was index 12 removed, so the new tail is (5,2), and there are 13 positions, but length should be the same, 13.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In the new list, the positions are: new head at (4,3), then the first body is the previous head (4,4), then the next bodies are the previous body segments except the last one (tail) is omitted.\n> \n> So for a snake of length L, after moving to empty cell, the new snake has the same length, with new head, and the body is the first L-1 positions of the previous snake.\n> \n> Previous snake: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1} (tail)\n> \n> After move to new cell Q (empty): new head Q, new body P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{L-2}, and P_{L-1} is removed.

It's turn 45, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) should be playable. But there are internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) and (1,6) are on the border, but since walls include border cells, (1,1) might be a wall cell? Let's see.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so that means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Then internal obstacles are additional walls: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). But (1,1) has y=1, not y=0, but x=1 is not border, but it's listed as internal obstacle, so it's a wall. Similarly, (1,6) has y=6, not y=7, but it's an obstacle. So effectively, walls are:\n> \n> - All cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> - Plus: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) is not a border cell since borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,1) is inside but listed as internal obstacle, so it's a wall. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So the snake has 13 segments. Head direction is R, meaning right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 3\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,1), it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 45, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 47? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N, it appears at turn t, and disappears after turn t + N - 1? Or after N turns from now?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> At the turn it's given, countdown is N. After that turn, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> In this case, current turn is 45.\n> \n> Food (4,1): life span 3, so countdown: at turn 45, it's 3, turn 46 it's 2, turn 47 it's 1, then after turn 47, at turn 48 it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 45,46,47.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6): life span 5, so available turns 45 to 49.\n> \n> (2,6): life span 8, available turns 45 to 52.\n> \n> All value +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns, thinking ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,4), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction.

Snake has (4,2) which is tail, but (5,2) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3): U (up, y+1 to (5,4)), but (5,4) is the second segment, so moving there would be body collision, deadly.\n> \n> D (down, y-1 to (5,2)) - is this possible? (5,2) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Walls are borders, so (5,2) should be free.\n> \n> L (left, x-1 to (4,3)) - (4,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,2), but not (4,3). (4,3) is empty? Positions: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), then (3,6), etc., and tail (4,2), so (4,3) is not occupied, should be free.\n> \n> R (right, x+1 to (6,3)) - (6,3) not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n> \n> But head direction is D, so I cannot instantly reverse to U, because that would be opposite direction.

(5,2) not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle.

(4,1) is y=1, (4,2) is y=2, so (4,1) is directly below (4,2), but (4,2) is tail.\n> \n> If I move to (4,1), I can eat the food, but need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> (4,1) has food with life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 46, life span 2, so it will be gone by turn 48? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span: at turn t, food has life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N more turns? The description: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,1) with life span 2 at turn 46: after turn 46, countdown decreases to 1; after turn 47, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten only on turn 46 or 47.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 4, so disappears after turn 50.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 7, disappears after turn 53.\n> \n> (3,6) life span 10, disappears after turn 56.\n> \n> But (3,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Now, snake movement: when snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and if it eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; otherwise, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,6), it's under the body, so when the snake moves, if that segment moves away, the food becomes accessible, but only if head moves there later.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 46, I need to choose action.\n> \n> I should consider the available food and plan a path.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> I'll make a grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles: (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> So mark those as blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> Tail at (4,2).\n> \n> Food: (4,1), (6,6), (2,6), (3,6) but (3,6) has snake on it.\n> \n> (4,1) is at bottom left, near tail.\n> \n> (6,6) top right, (2,6) top left.\n> \n> Now, current head (5,3), can move D to (5,2), L to (4,3), or R to (6,3).\n> \n> If I move D to (5,2), then new head (5,2), and snake grows only if it eats food.

It's turn 47. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So, I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,3), then body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). The head direction is R, meaning it's moving right, so from (6,3) to... since it's moving right, and head is at (6,3), next move could be to (7,3) but x=7 is a wall, so that would be a wall collision. But let's list all positions to understand the snake shape.\n> \n> Snake positions in order: head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). That's 13 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so it was moving right to reach (6,3) from previous position. Since head is at (6,3) and direction is R, it must have come from left, so previous head was at (5,3) or something? Positions: index 0 is head (6,3), index 1 is (5,3), which is left of head, so yes, it moved from (5,3) to (6,3) by moving right. So current direction is right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> From (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,4)\n> \n> - D: (6,2)\n> \n> - R: (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - L: (5,3) but (5,3) is the second segment, and since direction is R, moving L would be reverse, which is not allowed. Also, (5,3) is occupied by body, but in snake movement, you can move to the tail cell because the tail moves, but here (5,3) is not the tail; tail is at (3,2). Let's see the positions.\n> \n> After head (6,3), next is (5,3), which is the neck, then (5,4), etc., down to tail (3,2).\n> \n> So from (6,3), moving L to (5,3) is invalid because it's instant reverse and also (5,3) is occupied by the body segment immediately behind head. But rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" so since current direction is R, moving L (left) is opposite, so not allowed. Also, even if it were allowed, moving to (5,3) would collide with body, but (5,3) is not the tail; tail is at (3,2), which is far away. So moving to (5,3) would cause collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,3) is a body segment, not the tail, so moving to it would cause collision. Similarly, tail is at (3,2), which might be movable to if head goes there and tail moves away.\n> \n> But for now, from (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,4): is this free? Check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=7,y=7 etc., but (6,4) is within bounds? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (6,4) is valid. Obstacles: internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (6,4) is an obstacle! So (6,4) is occupied by an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - D to (6,2): (6,2) is within bounds, not a wall. Obstacles: none at (6,2), so possible.\n> \n> - R to (7,3): x=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L to (5,3): instant reverse not allowed, and also occupied by body, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,2)? But that can't be right; let me double-check.\n> \n> Current head at (6,3), direction R.\n> \n> Move U: (6,4) – but (6,4) is an internal obstacle, as per list: (6,4) is there.\n> \n> Move D: (6,2) – no obstacle, should be free.\n> \n> Move R: (7,3) – wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move L: (5,3) – opposite direction, invalid, and body occupied.\n> \n> So only D to (6,2) is possible? But that seems dangerous because I need to think about food and future moves.\n> \n> But I have to choose an action for turn 47.\n> \n> First, let's list the food:\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life_span 3? Format: (x,y, life_span, value) I think.\n> \n> It says: Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) etc.\n> \n> In input: \" (4, 1, 1, 1) \" – probably (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the text: \" (4, 1, 1, 1) \" and it says \"value1, life_span1\" in the description.\n> \n> In the state: \" (4, 1, 1, 1) \" and it's listed as \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", so I think it's (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> Similarly, \" (6, 6, 3, 1) \" so (6,6) value 3? No: \" (6, 6, 3, 1) \" and \"value and life span\", so (x,y, value, life_span)? But value is +1 or -1, but here it says 3,1 for (6,6), which might be value=3? But the core rules say positive food +1, negative -1, but here values are given, so for (6,6) it's value 3? That can't be right.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Positive Food Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food Penalty Value = -1\", but in state, it's given with numbers, so for (4,1,1,1) – let's read carefully.\n> \n> State input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" then \" - (4, 1, 1, 1) \" – it says \"Life Span and Value\", but in the dash, it's written as (x,y, a, b).\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)?\n> \n> Look at the text: \" (4, 1, 1, 1) \" and it's under \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\", so likely (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? But value should be +1 or -1, but here for (4,1,1,1), if it's value 1, life_span 1, or vice versa.\n> \n> Similarly, \" (6, 6, 3, 1) \" – if value 3, that contradicts core rules, but core rules say reward +1 for positive, but perhaps in this game, values can be different? No, core rules specify for positive food, reward +1, length +1, etc.\n> \n> I think I misread. Core rules: \"Positive Food Reward Value = +1\" but it says \"Value = +1\", meaning the score increase is +1, but in state, the number might be the life span or something.\n> \n> State: \" (4, 1, 1, 1) \" and it says \"Value and Life Span\", so for each food, it's specified with value and life span.\n> \n> For (4,1), it's (4,1) with value 1 and life span 1? But value 1 means positive food, I assume.\n> \n> Similarly, \" (6, 6, 3, 1) \" – this might be (x,y, life_span, value) = (6,6, 3,1) so life span 3, value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, \" (2, 6, 6, 1) \" life span 6, value 1\n> \n> \" (3, 6, 9, 1) \" life span 9, value 1\n> \n> All have value 1, so all positive food? But (3,6) is listed, but in snake positions, (3,6) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions include (4,6), (3,6), etc.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> But (3,6) is currently occupied by snake body, as per positions: snake has (4,6), (3,6), etc.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n> \n> So (3,6) has food under it, but snake body is there, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (4,1) life span 1, meaning it disappears after 1 turn, so on turn 48, it will be gone if not eaten? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn 47, life span is 1, after this turn, it becomes 0 and disappears, so must be eaten this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 3, so after 3 turns it disappears, etc.\n> \n> Now, back to movement. From head at (6,3), only possible move is D to (6,2), since U to (6,4) is obstacle, R to (7,3) wall, L to (5,3) reverse and body.\n> \n> But is (6,2) safe? Let's see what is at (6,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: tail is at (3,2), and (2,2), (2,3), etc., so (6,2) is not occupied by snake, I think. List: positions are (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So (6,2) is empty? But we have walls and obstacles; obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), no (6,2), so (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> But after moving to (6,2), the snake will have new head at (6,2), and body will follow, so tail at (3,2) will move to where? When head moves to (6,2), the tail will move forward, so the segment at (3,2) will be removed, and new segment added at head, so snake grows only if food eaten.\n> \n> But no food at (6,2), so length same, tail moves away from (3,2).\n> \n> Then for next turns, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> But I must choose action for turn 47.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,2), that seems the only choice, but let's confirm if there are other options.\n> \n> Is there a way to turn? But from (6,3), U and R are blocked, L not allowed, so only D.\n> \n> But direction is R, so moving D is possible, not reverse.\n> \n> So for turn 47, I have to move D to (6,2).\n> \n> Then new head position: (6,2)\n> \n> Snake body: the neck was (5,3), so now the body segments shift, tail (3,2) is removed? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — 13 segments.\n> \n> After moving down to (6,2):\n> \n> New head: (6,2)\n> \n> Then the body: the first body segment (5,3) moves to where head was, (6,3)? No, in snake, when head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,2), then next segment at previous head position (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), and the tail (3,2) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> List indices: let's say positions P0 = head (6,3), P1 = (5,3), P2 = (5,4), P3 = (4,4), P4 = (4,5), P5 = (4,6), P6 = (3,6), P7 = (3,5), P8 = (3,4), P9 = (3,3), P10 = (2,3), P11 = (2,2), P12 = tail (3,2)\n> \n> After move down: new head at (6,2) which is (6,3) but y-1, so (6,2).\n> \n> Then new P1 at old P0 (6,3), new P2 at old P1 (5,3), new P3 at old P2 (5,4), and so on, up to new P12 at old P11 (2,2), and old P12 (3,2) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> Tail is now (2,2), and (3,2) is gone.\n> \n> Head direction: since I moved down, new direction is D.\n> \n> Now, for turn 48, from (6,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (up) because opposite to down.\n> \n> So can move D (down to (6,1)), L (left to (5,2)), R (right to (7,2) but wall, invalid).\n> \n> Now, (6,1): is it free? Walls: y=0 is wall, but (6,1) y=1, not wall. Obstacles: obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), etc., no (6,1), so (6,1) free.\n> \n> (5,2): not wall, not obstacle, and not in snake positions?

But turn 47 is current turn, and we are at (6,3), moving to (6,2), not eating anything. So (4,1) will disappear after turn 47 since life span 1, countdown decreases this turn, so after turn 47, it's gone. So no chance to eat it.\n> \n> - (6,6): at (6,6), value 1, life span 3.

But (3,6) is currently occupied by snake body, as per initial positions, P6 was (3,6). After turn 47 move, new positions: head (6,2), body includes (4,6), (3,6), etc., so (3,6) still occupied.\n> \n> To eat (3,6), the snake must move away from it, then head can move there later.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is free, I think.\n> \n> (2,6) is not in snake positions; snake has (4,6) and (3,6), not (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is a food position.\n> \n> Also, (6,6) is food, free.\n> \n> Now, for turn 48, from (6,2), I can move to (6,1) or (5,2).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake is long, 13 segments.\n> \n> Available food: after turn 47, (4,1) gone, so food: (6,6) life span 2 left (after turn 47, life span 3, after turn 48 it will be 2, then after turn 49 it will be 1, etc.)\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so for (6,6) at turn 47, life span 3, after turn 47, it becomes 2, after turn 48, it becomes 1, after turn 49, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 6, at turn 47, after turn 47 it becomes 5, etc.\n> \n> (3,6) life span 9, after turn 47 it becomes 8, but it's under snake body, so not eatable yet.\n> \n> Now, from (6,2) at turn 48, options:\n> \n> Move D to (6,1): then head at (6,1)\n> \n> Or move L to (5,2): head at (5,2)\n> \n> If I go to (6,1), then from there, I can move to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; or (5,1), or (7,1) wall.

It's turn 48. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). So these cells are blocked and can't be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,2), and the body segments follow: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2). So the tail is at (2,2). Snake length is 13 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is down (D), which means last move was downward, so from (6,1) to (6,2)? Positions are given with head first, so at turn 48, head is at (6,2), and it moved down to get there, so previous head position was (6,1), but (6,1) isn't in the positions list. Let's list all positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (6,2) head\n> \n> 1: (6,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,3)\n> \n> 3: (5,4)\n> \n> 4: (4,4)\n> \n> 5: (4,5)\n> \n> 6: (4,6)\n> \n> 7: (3,6)\n> \n> 8: (3,5)\n> \n> 9: (3,4)\n> \n> 10: (3,3)\n> \n> 11: (2,3)\n> \n> 12: (2,2) tail\n> \n> Since head direction is D, and head is at (6,2), that means it came from (6,1), but (6,1) is not in the positions. (6,1) might be outside or something? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is valid, but positions start from (6,2). Perhaps the snake was at (6,1) before moving to (6,2), but it's not listed because positions are current. Anyway, head direction D means it moved down to (6,2), so from (6,1) to (6,2), but (6,1) is not occupied now since positions show from (6,2) onwards. That makes sense; when moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 3 (so disappears after 3 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 48, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 50? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Or at the start of turn t + L?\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means: at the beginning, life span is N. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, that means on turn t, with life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t + L - 1, it disappears? For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t. If L=2, it disappears at the end of turn t+1, etc.\n> \n> But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Look: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at turn t, life span L means it has L turns left, including the current turn. So after L turns, it will be gone. For example, L=1: present only on this turn, disappears before next turn. L=2: present this turn and next, disappears before turn after next.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (6,6): life span 3 at turn 48, so it will disappear after turn 50? Turn 48: L=3, after turn 48, L decreases to 2 for turn 49, then to 1 for turn 50, then to 0 and disappears before turn 51. So it can be eaten on turns 48, 49, or 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6): value 1, life span 5, so disappears after turn 52? L=5 at turn 48, after turn 48: L=4, turn 49: L=3, turn 50: L=2, turn 51: L=1, turn 52: L=0, disappears before turn 53.

When the snake moves, if it doesn't grow, the tail moves away, so positions shift.\n> \n> But to eat food under body, the body must move away first, then head moves on.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,2) and (2,2) are not adjacent; they are 4 apart in x.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns: turns 48,49,50,51,52, etc.\n> \n> But the sequence should start from turn 48.\n> \n> First, at turn 48, I have to choose: D or L.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,1), or L to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid and possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles: (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: head (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> Food: (6,6), (2,6), and (3,6) under body.\n> \n> (3,6) is food but occupied.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (6,1) at turn 48, what happens?\n> \n> Move D to (6,1): new head position (6,1). Since no food there, snake does not grow, so tail moves away. Tail was at (2,2), so new positions: head (6,1), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, so body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), ..., up to (2,3), and tail (2,2) is removed? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3) — and (2,2) is gone. Length decreases? No, without eating, length same, so segments: 13 segments, after move, new head, and the last body segment is removed, so now 12 segments? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the tail cell is vacated. Number of segments unchanged if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, no food at (6,1), so snake moves: head to (6,1), then the segment that was at index 0 moves to new head, index 1 moves to index 0's old position, and so on, up to index 12 (tail) moves to index 11's old position, and the old tail cell (2,2) is free.\n> \n> New positions: head at (6,1), then the body segments: index 0 was (6,2), now body part at (6,2) from old head? Let's list:\n> \n> After move D to (6,1):\n> \n> - New head: (6,1)\n> \n> - Body segments: the first body segment is at old head position (6,2), then next at old first body position (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3) — and the old tail (2,2) is removed, so now 12 segments? But it should be 13 segments minus one because no growth.\n> \n> Initial positions: 13 cells.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell, so 14th cell? No, when not eating, head moves to new cell, but the tail leaves its cell, so net cells: one new cell occupied, one old tail vacated, so snake still 13 segments.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (6,1)\n> \n> Then, the segment that was head is now first body at (6,2)\n> \n> The segment that was at (6,3) is now at (6,3) — same?

it will always be occupied by some body segment until the snake moves away from that area.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that the body leaves (3,6), but since the body is connected, to free (3,6), the entire snake must move so that no segment is on (3,6), which requires the tail to be at (3,6) and then move away.\n> \n> So I need to have the tail at (3,6) at some point.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,2), so I need to move the snake so that the tail reaches (3,6).\n> \n> The tail will move to the position of the second last segment as the snake moves.\n> \n> For instance, from current, tail at (2,2), second last is (2,3), so when snake moves, tail moves to (2,3) if no growth, but (2,3) is occupied, so the cell (2,2) is freed, but (2,3) is now tail.\n> \n> Then next move, tail moves to where (2,3) was, but (2,3) moves to where (3,3) was or something.\n> \n> To have tail at (3,6), I need to have the second last segment at (3,6) when the tail is about to move there.\n> \n> But it's complicated.\n> \n> The cell (3,6) will be free when the segment that is there leaves and no segment moves into it, which happens only if that segment was the last one on that cell and the snake moves away.\n> \n> But since the snake is a path, (3,6) will be occupied until the tail passes through it.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (2,2), and (3,6) is occupied, so the tail is far, and to have the tail at (3,6), I need to move the head so that the body shifts and the tail moves towards (3,6).\n> \n> The current position of the tail is (2,2), and (3,6) is at (3,6), so I need to move the head in a way that the tail moves up or right.\n> \n> But it's the head movement that determines.\n> \n> Perhaps for now, since (3,6) has long life span, I can focus on (2,6) which is free.\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), free, value 1, life span 5 at turn 48, so available turns 48 to 52.\n> \n> Head at (6,2), so I need to go to (2,6).\n> \n> Path from (6,2) to (2,6): dx= -4, dy=4, so min 8 moves, but with obstacles and body, it might be longer.\n> \n> But I have 5 turns to eat it, from turn 48 to 52, but I can eat on turn 48,49,50,51,52.\n> \n> Turn 48: head at (6,2), (2,6) is not adjacent, so cannot eat on turn 48.\n> \n> Turn 49: if I move, I can be closer.\n> \n> But with min 8 moves, and only 4 moves by turn 52?

Also not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Right to (6,2): but (6,2) is currently occupied by segment 1, the first body segment. And since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Also, reverse is not allowed? Current direction is L, so moving right is reverse, which is not allowed on next turn. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So since head moved left to get here, I cannot move right immediately. So R is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - U: (5,3) - occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (5,1) - seems free? But is it safe?

So yes, free.\n> \n> - L: (4,2) - similarly, x=4, y=2, not border, not obstacle, not occupied, so free.\n> \n> - R: (6,2) - occupied by body, and also reverse, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Down to (5,1) or Left to (4,2).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food to consider.\n> \n> Food life spans: each food has a life span that decreases each turn, including this turn.\n> \n> Current turn 49.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,6): life=2, so disappears after 2 turns, meaning it will be gone after turn 50?

It's turn 50. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there are internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with some internal obstacles blocking cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,2), and the body segments follow: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). So the tail is at (3,3). The head direction is Left, meaning it was moving left to get to (4,2) from (5,2), I assume.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 3, life span 1\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 6, life span 1? Wait, no, the format is (x,y, value, life_span), so:\n> \n> - (6,6): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> - (2,6): value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> - (3,6): value=6, life_span=1? But (3,6) is part of the snake body? Let's see: snake positions include (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), etc. Yes, (3,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> The food at (3,6) has value 6 and life span 1. But since it's under the snake body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Life span: Disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for turn 50, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn? Life span decreases each turn, so if life_span is given as 1, that means it has 1 turn left, so after turn 50, it will be gone if not eaten. Let's clarify.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" and for (3,6) it's (3,6,6,1), which I think means (x,y,value,remaining_life).\n> \n> In the description: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And in the input, it's given as part of the state, so life_span is the remaining life, I believe. For example, (6,6,1,1) means at position (6,6), value 1, remaining life 1 turn, so it will disappear after turn 50 if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6,3,1) has remaining life 1.\n> \n> (3,6,6,1) has value 6, remaining life 1.\n> \n> (2,1,9,1) has value 9, remaining life 1.\n> \n> All foods have life span 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> But (3,6) is currently occupied by the snake body. Specifically, from the snake positions, (3,6) is the 9th segment or something. Snake positions: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (5,2), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5), 8: (4,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,4), 12: (3,3).\n> \n> So (3,6) is the body segment at index 9.\n> \n> Now, for food under body: it can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it. But since all foods have life span 1, and it's turn 50, if not eaten now, they disappear.\n> \n> But eating requires head to be on the food cell. So for (3,6), since it's under body, the head can't move to it directly; the body needs to move away first.

But if head moves to (3,6) this turn, but it's occupied, so impossible to eat (3,6) this turn because it's under body and head can't reach it in one move. Even if the snake moves, the body at (3,6) might move, but the head needs to be on (3,6) after the move.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves in such a way that the segment at (3,6) moves away, but since the snake moves as a whole, when head moves, the tail moves, but the cell (3,6) might be vacated only if the segment there moves.\n> \n> But for the head to eat the food, it must move to the food cell when it is free and has food.\n> \n> Currently (3,6) has food and is occupied, so it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from it.\n> \n> But with life span 1, after this turn, it disappears, so it's impossible to eat (3,6) because it can't be done this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> (3,6) has food, but it's under body, so to eat it, the body must move away first, which takes at least one turn, and then head moves to it, but with life span 1, it won't be there next turn, so indeed, (3,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for other foods not under body.\n> \n> So foods that can be eaten this turn are those not under body: (6,6), (2,6), (2,1)\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which is not in snake positions?

I think it's ambiguous.\n> \n> Look at the text: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 6, 3, 1) - (3, 6, 5, 1) - (2, 1, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> And the format is described as \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so for (2,6,3,1), it might be that (2,6) is position, 3 is value, 1 is life_span? But that doesn't make sense because value should be +1 or -1, and life_span is number.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6,5,1) – 5 and 1, (2,1,8,1) – 8 and 1.\n> \n> But all values are 1? The rule says positive food value +1, negative -1, but here all have last number 1, which might be value, and the third number is life_span.\n> \n> For (2,6,3,1): if (x,y) = (2,6), value = 1, life_span = 3\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6,5,1): (3,6), value=1, life_span=5\n> \n> (2,1,8,1): (2,1), value=1, life_span=8\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. All food here is positive, value +1, since value=1.\n> \n> And life_span: for (2,6) it's 3, so available turns 51,52,53\n> \n> (3,6) life_span 5, available turns 51 to 55\n> \n> (2,1) life_span 8, available turns 51 to 58\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,2), direction left, so last move was left to (3,2).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) immediately, as that would be reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction L, so moving left means decreasing x.\n> \n> Possible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> But no instant reverse: from current direction L, I cannot move R, because R is opposite to L.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U, D, L.

(2,2) is not in this list, so should be safe, but I need to consider if moving there causes collision after move.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the body shifts.\n> \n> But for collision, head should not hit any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> Specifically, collision if head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, which is (3,4), because after move, tail moves, so if head moves to tail position, it's ok, as tail leaves.\n> \n> But in this case, (2,2) is not occupied by any body, so moving L to (2,2) should be safe.\n> \n> Now, move U (up): to (3,3)\n> \n> (3,3) - is it occupied?

Walls: borders, internal (1,1), (1,6), etc. (2,6) — x=2,y=6, not border (borders are x=0,7 y=0,7), and not internal obstacle listed, so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).

Let's see: after move, new head (3,4), then old head (3,3) segment 1, old segment 1 (3,2) segment 2, ..., up to old segment 11 (3,6) segment 12, old tail (3,5) removed. New tail is (3,6) or something.\n> \n> Old segments before move turn 52: head (3,3), 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (5,2), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,5), 10: (4,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (3,4): new head (3,4), then old head (3,3) segment 1, old segment 1 (3,2) segment 2, old segment 2 (4,2) segment 3, ..., old segment 10 (4,6) segment 11, old segment 11 (3,6) segment 12, and old tail (3,5) removed.

(3,5) and (3,6) same x, y diff 1, so adjacent.\n> \n> And tail cell (3,6) has food? Food at (3,6) is there, value 1.\n> \n> So if I move head to (3,6), which is tail position, I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (3,6), and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail stays, and new segment added at head, so the cell (3,6) now has head and the old tail segment? Let's think.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so when head moves to food cell, the tail does not move, so length increases.\n> \n> So if head moves to tail position which has food, after eating, new head at that cell, and the tail remains, so the cell has both head and tail for a moment? No, positions: before move, head at (3,5), tail at (3,6).\n> \n> Move head to (3,6), which is food and tail position. Since it's food, snake eats it, so tail does not move. New positions: head at (3,6), then the previous head (3,5) becomes new segment 1, and so on, up to the previous tail (3,6) which is still there, but since tail doesn't move, the new tail is the last body segment before old tail.\n> \n> Before move: segments: head (3,5), body ..., tail (3,6)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,6) and eating food: new head at (3,6), then old head (3,5) as segment 1, then the rest of body, and the old tail (3,6) is now the second last segment or something? Since tail doesn't move, the snake grows, so the new snake has the old segments plus a new segment at head.\n> \n> Standard snake: when not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves from old position.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to new cell with food, tail does not move, so the new position has head, and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position, then the previous body, and the previous tail position remains as body.\n> \n> In this case, before move to (3,6): assume head at (3,5), tail at (3,6)\n> \n> After eating at (3,6): new head at (3,6), then previous head (3,5) as segment 1, then the body segments in between, and previous tail (3,6) is now a body segment, but new head is at (3,6), so immediately after move, head is at (3,6), and (3,6) was tail, but now it's head, and the old tail position has a body segment? Contradiction.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose before move, snake positions: [A, B, C, ..., Y, Z] where A head, Z tail.\n> \n> Move to a cell with food: head moves to new cell F, which has food. Then the new positions are: [F, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z] so Z remains as tail, and new head at F. Length increased by one.\n> \n> If F was not occupied, no problem.\n> \n> But if F is the current tail position, that means Z is at F, so moving to F means head moves to where tail is.\n> \n> Before move, A and Z are different cells.\n> \n> In this case, head at (3,5), tail at (3,6), different cells.\n> \n> Move head to (3,6), which is tail position and has food.\n> \n> After move: new head at (3,6), then previous head (3,5) as segment 1, then the previous segment 1 as segment 2, ..., up to previous segment n-1 as segment n, and previous tail (3,6) as segment n+1, but (3,6) is now both new head and a body segment? That can't be.\n> \n> Positions must be unique.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, it occupies that cell.\n> \n> If that cell was tail position, since tail will not move (because eating), the tail cell remains occupied, but head moves there, so it's the same cell, but it's head now.\n> \n> The body segments: the new body starts from the old head position.\n> \n> For example, positions before: [P1, P2, P3, ..., Pk] with P1 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> Move head to Q, which has food.\n> \n> Then new positions: [Q, P1, P2, P3, ..., Pk] so the tail is now Pk, which was the old tail, and it remains.\n> \n> So Q is new head, P1 is new segment 1, P2 new segment 2, ..., Pk new tail.\n> \n> In this case, if Q is Pk, then new positions: [Pk, P1, P2, P3, ..., Pk] but Pk is duplicated, which is impossible.\n> \n> So head cannot move to the current tail position if it has food, because it would create a duplicate position.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, and head moves to it, then after eating, new head at tail position, and new tail is the old head position, but since they were adjacent, after growth, the new head and new tail are not adjacent necessarily, but the collision might happen if the new head and the new segment are at the same position, but in the move, when head moves to tail position, it's the same cell, so before the move, head and tail are at different cells, but if head moves to tail cell, it's moving to an occupied cell, which is a collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> But generally, moving to tail position is allowed because tail moves away if not eating.\n> \n> But if eating, tail doesn't move, so moving to tail position with food would mean head and tail at same cell after move, which is collision.\n> \n> The rule explicitly says: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 53, if head at (3,5), tail at (3,6), they are adjacent, and tail cell (3,6) has food, so if I move to (3,6), I eat the food, but it kills the snake because of collision.\n> \n> So I should not do that.\n> \n> Back to the food at (2,6).\n> \n> Since I can't reach it by turn 53 from either initial move, I might not be able to eat (2,6) at all.\n> \n> At turn 51, from (3,2), if I move U to (3,3), then at turn 52, I can move to (2,3), then at turn 53, from (2,3) I can move to (2,2) or (1,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) wall, so not (2,6).\n> \n> Or from (2,3) at turn 53, I can move to (1,3), then turn 54 to (1,4), etc, but (2,6) gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if at turn 51 I move L to (2,2), same thing.\n> \n> So it seems impossible to eat (2,6) because of the wall at (2,4) and the position.\n> \n> Unless I am closer.\n> \n> But from current position, I am at (3,2), (2,6) is 4 steps away with obstacle, and only 2 turns left after this, so I need to be at (2,6) by turn 53, so at turn 52 I need to be adjacent to it.\n> \n> At turn 52, I need to be at (2,5), (1,6), or (3,6), or (2,7) but y=7 wall, so (2,5), (1,6) wall, or (3,6).\n> \n> (2,5) or (3,6).\n> \n> At turn 52, where can I be?\n> \n> At turn 51, after move, if I move U to (3,3), then at turn 52, I can be at (3,4), (2,3), or (4,3).\n> \n> None of which is (2,5) or (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6) is occupied by body at turn 52, as we saw earlier.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (2,2) at turn 51, at turn 52 I can be at (2,3), (1,2), or (2,1).\n> \n> Not (2,5) or (3,6).\n> \n> So indeed, I cannot reach (2,6) by turn 53;

Here all values are positive, so no negative food in this state. Value 1 means +1 reward, I think. Let me confirm: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" – for (2,6) it's (x,y,value,life_span), so value is the reward, and all are 1 here, so all positive food.\n> \n> But for (3,6), it says value 3? Let's see: \"(3, 6, 3, 1)\" – that might be a typo? No, it says: \" (2, 6, 1, 1) \" and \" (3, 6, 3, 1) \" – oh, (3,6) has value 3? But the core rules say positive food is +1 and negative is -1. Inconsistency?\n> \n> Looking back: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\". But here, for (3,6), it's value 3. That might be a mistake, or perhaps in this context, value can be different? The core rules don't specify that values are always +1 or -1; it says for positive food, reward value = +1, but here it's listed as 3 for (3,6). Let me read the state input.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\n> - (2, 6, 1, 1)\n> - (3, 6, 3, 1)\n> - (2, 1, 6, 1)\n> - (5, 3, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> For (3,6), it's value 3, life span 1.

Perhaps I misread the core rules.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\". But in the state, it's given with different values. Maybe the value here is the life span or something? No, the format is (x,y,value,life_span), so for (2,6) it's x=2,y=6,value=1,life_span=1.\n> \n> But core rules say reward value is +1 for positive, so value should be 1. For (3,6) it's 3, which is inconsistent. Perhaps it's a typo in the state description.\n> \n> Maybe \"value\" here means something else, but the core rules define it as reward value. I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Another possibility: in the food list, it says \"value and life span\", and for (3,6) it's 3 and 1, so value=3. But core rules say positive food has reward +1. Contradiction.\n> \n> Perhaps for this specific state, the values are given, so I should use them as is. But the rules imply that food can have different values? The core rules don't specify that values are always +1; it says \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive food, but maybe in this game, positive food can have different values? The description doesn't say that.\n> \n> Let me read the core rules carefully: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\" and similarly for negative. It doesn't say that all positive food have the same value; it might be that +1 is the standard, but here in the state, it's given as 1, 3, 1, 9, so perhaps the value is the reward, so (3,6) gives +3, and (5,3) gives +9? But that seems odd because the rules say \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> I think there might be a mistake in the state input or my understanding. Perhaps \"value\" in the food list is not the reward, but something else? No, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", and in the core rules, it's about reward/penalty.\n> \n> Another idea: in the special cases, it doesn't mention different values, so probably all positive food should be +1. But here (3,6) has value 3, which is different. I think I should go with what's given in the state. Since the state lists value, I'll assume that value is the reward, so (3,6) gives +3, (5,3) gives +9, etc.\n> \n> But (2,6) is value 1, (2,1) is value 1, (5,3) is value 9? That can't be; value 9 for life span 1? Let's see the list: \" (5, 3, 9, 1) \" so x=5,y=3,value=9,life_span=1. But core rules say life span is N, disappears after N turns.\n> \n> I think for the sake of this, I should use the values as provided in the state. So (3,6) has high value 3, (5,3) has very high value 9, but life span 1, so it disappears soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) value 1, life span 1, (2,1) value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> Also, note that (3,6) is a food position, but (3,6) is also the tail of the snake, since snake positions end with (3,6).

It's turn 54. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with some cells blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). That's 13 segments. Head direction is Up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1, life span 3 (so disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 54, it has life span 3, meaning it will be there for turns 54, 55, 56, and disappear after that? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (3,6) with life span 3 on turn 54: on turn 54, countdown is 3; after turn 54, it becomes 2; after turn 55, it becomes 1; after turn 56, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 54, 55, 56.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,1) with value 1, life span 5: present from turn 54 to 58.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) with value 1, life span 8: present from turn 54 to 61.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? No, the value is given: (3,6,3,1) – I think this is (x,y, life_span, value). Let me read: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for (3,6,3,1) that should be x=3,y=6, life_span=3, value=1. Similarly, (2,1,5,1) is x=2,y=1, life_span=5, value=1; and (5,3,8,1) is x=5,y=3, life_span=8, value=1. So all are positive food, value +1 each. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,5) moving Up. So possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is Up, so cannot move Down immediately.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: list of coordinates:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> (4,6) is the tail, I assume.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,6), (2,1), (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is also a body segment? Let's see: snake has (6,3), (5,3), etc. (5,3) is part of the snake body. But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in later.\n> \n> Specifically, (5,3) has food on it? Food at (5,3) with life span 8.\n> \n> But (5,3) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: from head: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> (5,3) is the 9th segment? Let's index: position 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,4), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,5), 12: (4,6) tail.\n> \n> So (5,3) is occupied by the snake body at index 8. But there is food at (5,3). Since the body is on it, the snake can eat it only if the body moves away and then head moves in.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (3,6) and (2,1) are not occupied by snake, I think. (3,6): is it occupied? Snake has (3,5), (3,4), etc., but not (3,6). (4,6) is tail, but (3,6) is free. Similarly, (2,1) should be free.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,5), direction Up. Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (3,6)\n> \n> - Down: to (3,4), but (3,4) is body segment, and also, cannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is Up, so Down is opposite, so cannot move Down.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,5)\n> \n> - Right: to (4,5)\n> \n> But (4,5) is body segment? Snake positions: (4,5) is index 11, which is body, not head.\n> \n> Moving to a body segment: if I move to (4,5), which is a body cell, but since the snake moves, the tail might move, so it's only deadly if it's not the tail or if it collides.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells by snake: all positions except the tail might be dangerous if moved into, but only if it doesn't move away.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward if no food eaten, or stays if food eaten.\n> \n> Standard snake: if eat food, length increases, tail doesn't move; if not, tail moves.\n> \n> Here: when eating positive food, length +1, so tail doesn't move; if not, or eat negative, length unchanged, tail moves.\n> \n> But all food here is positive.\n> \n> Now, for collision: after move, if head is on a cell that is part of the body, it dies. But since body moves, only cells that remain occupied might cause collision.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving, if head is on a cell that was occupied by body except the tail, and that body segment doesn't move away, it collides.\n> \n> But the tail moves if no food eaten.\n> \n> Easier to think of the snake body excluding the tail when considering collisions.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (3,6): what is at (3,6)? There is food at (3,6) with value 1. Also, (3,6) is not a wall, and not occupied by body? Snake positions: (3,5), (3,4), etc., no (3,6), so it's free except for food.\n> \n> (3,6) is within bounds? y=6, since y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border? Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So y=6 is not wall, x=3 is not wall. Also, no internal obstacles at (3,6), obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (3,6) is clear.\n> \n> So moving Up to (3,6) would eat the food, since it's there. Then snake grows, so new head at (3,6), body remains, tail stays at (4,6), but length increases, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Tail is at (4,6), head is now at (3,6). Are they adjacent? (3,6) and (4,6) are adjacent horizontally. But \"Tail Reward Danger\" only if head was adjacent to tail before eating and tail has food? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, before moving, head at (3,5), tail at (4,6). Are they adjacent? (3,5) and (4,6): difference in x and y, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (3,5) and (4,6) are diagonal, not adjacent. Therefore, no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6), head at (3,6), tail at (4,6), which are adjacent now, but since we just moved, and no food on tail cell? Tail cell is (4,6), which has no food mentioned, so it's fine. The danger is only if we eat food that is on the tail when head is adjacent.\n> \n> Here, we are eating food at (3,6), not on tail.\n> \n> So moving Up seems safe and gets +1.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Other moves:\n> \n> Left to (2,5): (2,5) is what? Is it free? Snake positions: no (2,5), walls: x=0 is wall, but x=2>0, y=5<7, not border. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed, so should be free. Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is above it, not obstacle. So (2,5) is empty. Moving Left to (2,5) should be safe, no food there.\n> \n> Right to (4,5): (4,5) is occupied by snake body, index 11. Now, if I move to (4,5), which is currently occupied, but after move, the body will shift. Since I don't eat food, tail moves, so the cell (4,5) will be vacated when tail moves? Let's see.\n> \n> Current snake: positions from 0 to 12: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> If I move Right to (4,5), which is currently occupied by segment 11. But after moving, new head at (4,5), then the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to old head? Standard: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,5), which was position of segment 11, but segment 11 was at (4,5), now head is there, so segment 0 is now (4,5). Then segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, which is (3,5), but (3,5) was head, now segment 1 is at (3,5). Then segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (3,4), and so on, down to segment 12 (tail) moves to where segment 11 was, but segment 11 was at (4,5), which is now head, so segment 11 moves to (4,5)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> The positions after move:\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)  (since we moved right)\n> \n> - Then the body: the first body segment (index 1) moves to the old head position (3,5)\n> \n> - Index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (3,4)\n> \n> - Index 3 to where index 2 was, (3,3)\n> \n> - Index 4 to where index 3 was, (3,2)\n> \n> - Index 5 to where index 4 was, (4,2)\n> \n> - Index 6 to where index 5 was, (5,2)\n> \n> - Index 7 to where index 6 was, (6,2)\n> \n> - Index 8 to where index 7 was, (6,3)\n> \n> - Index 9 to where index 8 was, (5,3)\n> \n> - Index 10 to where index 9 was, (5,4)\n> \n> - Index 11 to where index 10 was, (4,4)\n> \n> - Index 12 (tail) to where index 11 was, which was (4,5), but (4,5) is now the new head, so it moves to (4,5), which is occupied? Collision.\n> \n> When the tail moves to where the previous segment was, but in this case, segment 11 was at (4,5), which is now the head, so when segment 12 moves to (4,5), it collides with head.\n> \n> But the rule says: you can move into the tail cell because tail moves, but here we're moving into a body cell that is not the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is at (4,6). (4,5) is index 11, which is a body segment.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5), the cell (4,5) is occupied by head, and then when the body shifts, segment 11 moves to (4,4) or something? Let's sequence.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> Positions: seg0: (3,5), seg1: (3,4), seg2: (3,3), seg3: (3,2), seg4: (4,2), seg5: (5,2), seg6: (6,2), seg7: (6,3), seg8: (5,3), seg9: (5,4), seg10: (4,4), seg11: (4,5), seg12: (4,6)\n> \n> After move right to (4,5):\n> \n> - New seg0 (head): (4,5)  // moved to this cell\n> \n> - Then seg1 (new body) moves to old seg0 position: (3,5)\n> \n> - seg2 moves to old seg1 position: (3,4)\n> \n> - seg3 moves to old seg2 position: (3,3)\n> \n> - seg4 moves to old seg3 position: (3,2)\n> \n> - seg5 moves to old seg4 position: (4,2)\n> \n> - seg6 moves to old seg5 position: (5,2)\n> \n> - seg7 moves to old seg6 position: (6,2)\n> \n> - seg8 moves to old seg7 position: (6,3)\n> \n> - seg9 moves to old seg8 position: (5,3)\n> \n> - seg10 moves to old seg9 position: (5,4)\n> \n> - seg11 moves to old seg10 position: (4,4)  // because old seg10 was (4,4)\n> \n> - seg12 (tail) moves to old seg11 position: (4,5)  // but (4,5) is now occupied by new head!\n> \n> So when seg12 moves to (4,5), it collides with head at (4,5), so death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,5) is invalid because it causes collision.\n> \n> Similarly, Down is not possible because it's opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible moves are only Up to (3,6) or Left to (2,5).\n> \n> Down to (3,4) is body and opposite direction, so not possible.\n> \n> Left to (2,5) is possible, as we said.\n> \n> Now, Up to (3,6): there is food, so eat it, grow, new head at (3,6), tail remains at (4,6) for now, since we ate.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added at head, but since head moved to (3,6), and we ate, the new position is: head at (3,6), then the body: seg0 was (3,5), now it becomes the first body segment, so positions: new seg0: (3,6), seg1: (3,5) (old head), seg2: (3,4) (old seg1), ..., up to seg12: (4,6) (old tail, now stays), and new seg13?

It's turn 55, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is playable. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 playable. But there are internal obstacles, so I have to avoid those too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up. But since the head is at (3,6) and moving up, but y=6 is the top row? y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's see: walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. So moving up increases y? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in programming, sometimes y increases downwards. I need to check the movement definition.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So U is increasing y, which means up, assuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Since walls at y=0 and y=7, and y=0 is probably bottom if y increases upwards. But let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,6), and direction U, so if U is (x,y+1), then moving up would go to y=7, but y=7 is a wall, so it can't move up. Head is at (3,6), and walls at y=7, so moving U to (3,7) is impossible, it's a wall. But the head direction is U, meaning last move was up, so it came from below? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), ...] so head at (3,6), next segment (3,5), so it was moving down? Positions are listed head first, so (3,6) is head, (3,5) is the first body segment, meaning the head was at (3,5) before and moved to (3,6)? But direction is U, up.\n> \n> If head is at (3,6) and direction is U, meaning it moved up to get there. But from where? If it moved up to (3,6), it must have come from (3,5), since U is (x,y+1), so from (3,5) to (3,6) is up. But in the positions, (3,5) is the next segment, so yes, head was at (3,5) and moved up to (3,6).

Countdown decreases every turn including current, so if current turn is 55, it will disappear at turn 55 + 4 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,1) with life span 4 at turn 55, it will be gone after turn 58? Let's see: at turn 55, life span is 4, so after turn 55, it decreases to 3, then turn 56 to 2, turn 57 to 1, turn 58 to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 55 to 57 inclusive? At turn 55, life span 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including turn 55. After turn 55, it has 3 left, and so on, until life span 0 after N turns.\n> \n> The food is present for N turns starting from when it appears, but here it's given at turn 55 with life span, so it has that many turns left.\n> \n> For (2,1): life span 4 at turn 55, so it disappears after turn 58 (since turn 55:4, 56:3, 57:2, 58:1, then gone after 58? Or at turn 58 it has life span 1, so can be eaten on turn 58, then after that gone.

Check walls: x=2 between 1-6, y=6 between 1-6? y=6 is not wall, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Obstacles: internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) is not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: tail is at (4,6), and (4,5), etc., no (2,6), so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> - R: to (4,6) — (4,6) is the tail.

After k moves, the segment that was at position i will be at position i in the new list, but shifted.\n> \n> After one move: the segment that was at body index j moves to the position that was body index j-1.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell occupied by segment i, after k moves, it will be vacated when that segment has moved k times, but only if k is large enough that it is no longer in the same cell.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) is occupied until the segment there moves, which happens every move, but the cell is only vacated when no segment is there after the move.\n> \n> After each move, the segment that was at (5,3) moves to a new cell, and if no new segment comes, it's free.\n> \n> But in this case, since it's not the tail, when it moves, the next segment comes in, so (5,3) is occupied until the tail passes through or something.\n> \n> Let's think of the snake as a queue: the head adds a cell, the tail removes a cell.\n> \n> For a body cell, it will be vacated when the tail reaches that position in the sequence.\n> \n> The number of moves until a particular body cell is vacated is equal to the number of segments from that point to the tail.\n> \n> For segment at index i, the number of moves until it becomes the tail is (tail index - i).\n> \n> Tail index is 13, segment at (5,3) is index 9, so 13-9 = 4 moves to become the tail.\n> \n> After 4 moves, the segment that was at index 9 will be at index 13, and when it moves, (5,3) is vacated.\n> \n> After 4 moves:\n> \n> - After move 1: segment from index 9 moves to index 8's old position, but index 8 is (6,3), so segment 9 moves to (6,3) if head moves, but it depends on the path.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) will be vacated after exactly 4 moves, regardless of the path, because after 4 moves, the segment that was there has moved away, and no other segment is at that cell since the snake moves continuously.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was at position p will be at a new position, and the cell p will be free if not occupied by another segment, but in a snake, since it's a path, cells are unique, so after the segment leaves, it's free until something else comes.\n> \n> But in this case, for (5,3), it is occupied by segment 9. After 4 moves, segment 9 will be the tail (since tail index 13, after 4 moves, the head has moved 4 times, so the segment that was at index 9 will be at index 9 + 4? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify indices.\n> \n> At time t, positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P13\n> \n> After one move to new head position H, new positions: H, P0, P1, P2, ..., P12. So the tail P13 is removed.\n> \n> So the segment that was at P1 is now at P0, was at P2 now at P1, etc.\n> \n> The segment that was at position i is now at position i-1 for i>0, and P0 is gone.\n> \n> For a fixed cell, say C = P9 at time t.\n> \n> After one move, the segment that was at P9 is now at position 8 in the new snake, at the location that was P8 at time t.\n> \n> Similarly, after k moves, the segment that was at P9 is now at position 9 - k in the new snake, for k <=9.\n> \n> After k moves, position of the segment that was at index i: it is now at index i - k if i - k >=0, else it is gone.\n> \n> But for the cell C, it was occupied by the segment at index 9. After one move, that segment moves to where P8 was, so C is now occupied by the segment that was at P10, because new positions: head new, then P0, P1, ..., P12, so the cell that was P9 is now occupied by the segment that was P10.\n> \n> Similarly, after k moves, the cell C is occupied by the segment that was at index 9+k, for k such that 9+k <=13.\n> \n> Specifically, at time t, cell P9 occupied by segment 9.\n> \n> After one move at t+1, cell P9 is occupied by segment 10 (which was at P10 at t).\n> \n> After two moves, at t+2, cell P9 is occupied by segment 11.\n> \n> After three moves, t+3, occupied by segment 12.\n> \n> After four moves, t+4, occupied by segment 13 (tail).\n> \n> After five moves, t+5, the tail has moved, so cell P9 is vacated, no segment there.\n> \n> So for cell (5,3) which is P9, it will be vacated after 5 moves from now, at turn 60.\n> \n> After 4 moves, at turn 59, it is occupied by the tail segment, and when the snake moves at turn 60, the tail moves away, so (5,3) is free at the beginning of turn 60.\n> \n> But for eating, the food can be eaten when the head moves to it after it's free.\n> \n> So to eat the food at (5,3), we need to move the head there after the cell is free, so at turn 60 or later.\n> \n> Life span of (5,3) is 7 at turn 55, so it will be present until turn 61 (since turns 55 to 61 inclusive, 7 turns: 55,56,57,58,59,60,61).\n> \n> At turn 55, life span 7, so:\n> \n> - Turn 55: life span 7\n> \n> - Turn 56: 6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 61: 1\n> \n> - After turn 61, gone.

So I need to move so that the body leaves (5,3) before I can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, other positions.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (4,5), and head at (4,6), so if I move down to (4,5), I eat the tail? No, moving to tail position: since it's tail, and I move there, then the snake grows, but the tail doesn't move away immediately? Let's think about movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But for moving to tail: if head moves to tail position, and tail is there, but after movement, the tail will move to the previous position of segment before tail, so the cell is vacated, and head is now there, but since we moved to it, if it was food, we eat it.\n> \n> In this case, (4,5) has food? No, food is at (2,1), (5,3), (5,1), not at (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is snake tail, no food mentioned there.\n> \n> So moving to (4,5) is safe, but no food, so just move, snake length same.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,6) is empty.\n> \n> But I need to plan for food.\n> \n> Also, there is a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,5), head at (4,6), so adjacent vertically. If tail had food, and I eat it, it would be dangerous. But tail has no food, so no issue now.\n> \n> Now, let's think about getting to the foods.\n> \n> First, food at (2,1) with short life span, only 3 turns left. But (2,1) is far from current position (4,6). Distance: x from 4 to 2, y from 6 to 1, so |dx|=2, |dy|=5, min moves 7, but with obstacles, might be more.\n> \n> But life span 3, so only 3 turns, impossible to reach by turn 58. Turn 56,57,58: three moves from now.\n> \n> From (4,6), in one move I can go to (4,5) or (5,6). Then from there, etc.\n> \n> To (2,1): even from (4,5), to (2,1) is at least |dx| + |dy| = 2+4=6 moves, since y=5 to y=1 is 4 down, x from 4 to 2 is 2 left. But with obstacles, might be longer.\n> \n> For example, internal obstacles at (3,1), (1,1), etc., but (2,1) is food, and (1,1) is obstacle, so (2,1) might be accessible, but not from above directly if (3,1) is obstacle.\n> \n> (3,1) is obstacle, so to reach (2,1), I need to come from left, right, or below, but y=0 is wall, so below not possible. (2,1) has y=1, so can come from (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1), but (1,1) and (3,1) are obstacles, so only from (2,2) above.\n> \n> (2,2) is not obstacle, but is it occupied? Snake has (3,2), (4,2), etc., but (2,2) is not in snake positions, so free? Snake positions: (3,2) at index 5, (4,2) at index 6, so (2,2) is empty.\n> \n> But to reach (2,2), from (4,6), it's far. In 3 moves, impossible. For example, best case, down to (4,5), then down to (4,4) but (4,4) is snake body, index 12, occupied. Not free.\n> \n> From (4,6) to (2,1) in 3 moves: not possible. Even in 4 or 5, but life span only 3 turns, so I cannot eat (2,1) food. It will disappear without being eaten. So I should ignore it, not worth the risk.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is on snake body, so I need to vacate it first.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) is free, but life span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> So focus on (5,3) and (5,1).\n> \n> First, (5,3) is occupied by snake body at index 10: (5,3). When the snake moves, this segment will move to where index 9 was, which is (6,3). Index 9 is (6,3), so when snake moves, segment 10 moves to (6,3)? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, up to tail.\n> \n> So for segment k, it moves to the previous position of segment k-1.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, position new_head, then old_head becomes segment 1, and so on.\n> \n> For example, if I move right to (5,6), then new head (5,6), old head (4,6) becomes segment 1, then (3,6) becomes segment 2, etc., down to tail (4,5) becomes... let's list the positions after a move.\n> \n> Assume I move right to (5,6).\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> Head: (5,6)\n> \n> Then segment 1: (4,6)  // old head\n> \n> Segment 2: (3,6)  // old seg1\n> \n> Segment 3: (3,5)  // old seg2\n> \n> Segment 4: (3,4)  // old seg3\n> \n> Segment 5: (3,3)  // old seg4\n> \n> Segment 6: (3,2)  // old seg5\n> \n> Segment 7: (4,2)  // old seg6\n> \n> Segment 8: (5,2)  // old seg7\n> \n> Segment 9: (6,2)  // old seg8\n> \n> Segment 10: (6,3)  // old seg9? Old seg9 is (6,3), so new seg10 should be old seg9 position? No.\n> \n> After move, the segments shift: new segment 1 is old head position, new segment 2 is old segment 1 position, ..., new segment 14 is old segment 13 position, but since no food eaten, tail is cut off, so snake length same, positions from 0 to 13, after move, new positions 0 to 12? No.\n> \n> Snake has 14 segments. When it moves without eating, the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> New head position: (5,6) if move R\n> \n> Then new segment 1: (4,6)  // where head was\n> \n> New segment 2: (3,6)  // where segment 1 was\n> \n> New segment 3: (3,5)  // where segment 2 was\n> \n> New segment 4: (3,4)  // where segment 3 was\n> \n> New segment 5: (3,3)  // where segment 4 was\n> \n> New segment 6: (3,2)  // where segment 5 was\n> \n> New segment 7: (4,2)  // where segment 6 was\n> \n> New segment 8: (5,2)  // where segment 7 was\n> \n> New segment 9: (6,2)  // where segment 8 was\n> \n> New segment 10: (6,3)  // where segment 9 was\n> \n> New segment 11: (5,3)  // where segment 10 was? Old segment 10 was (5,3), so new segment 11 is old segment 10 position? No.\n> \n> Old segment 9 was (6,3), so after move, new segment 10 is the position of old segment 9, which is (6,3).\n> \n> Let's list old positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (4,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (5,2), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,4), 12: (4,4), 13: (4,5)\n> \n> After move R to (5,6):\n> \n> New head: (5,6)\n> \n> New seg1: old head (4,6)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (3,6)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 (3,5)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 (3,4)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 (3,3)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 (3,2)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6 (4,2)\n> \n> New seg8: old seg7 (5,2)\n> \n> New seg9: old seg8 (6,2)\n> \n> New seg10: old seg9 (6,3)\n> \n> New seg11: old seg10 (5,3)  // (5,3) is where old seg10 was\n> \n> New seg12: old seg11 (5,4)  // (5,4)\n> \n> New seg13: old seg12 (4,4)  // (4,4)\n> \n> Tail is new seg13: (4,4)\n> \n> Old tail (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, the food at (5,3) was under old seg10. After move, new seg11 is at (5,3), so still occupied by snake body? New seg11 is at (5,3), yes.\n> \n> But food is at (5,3), so it's still under body.\n> \n> If I move, the body moves, but the cell (5,3) might be occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> In this case, after move, new seg11 is at (5,3), so still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (5,3), I need to move so that no segment is there.\n> \n> Currently, after this move, it's occupied.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,5) instead.\n> \n> Move D to (4,5): (4,5) is old tail.\n> \n> New head: (4,5)\n> \n> New seg1: old head (4,6)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (3,6)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 (3,5)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 (3,4)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 (3,3)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 (3,2)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6 (4,2)\n> \n> New seg8: old seg7 (5,2)\n> \n> New seg9: old seg8 (6,2)\n> \n> New seg10: old seg9 (6,3)\n> \n> New seg11: old seg10 (5,3)  // (5,3)\n> \n> New seg12: old seg11 (5,4)  // (5,4)\n> \n> New seg13: old seg12 (4,4)  // (4,4)\n> \n> Tail new seg13: (4,4)\n> \n> Old tail (4,5) is now head, so (5,3) still occupied by new seg11.\n> \n> In both cases, (5,3) is occupied after one move.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence to vacate (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) is currently segment 10. When the snake moves, segment 10 will move to where segment 9 is now, which is (6,3), so after any move, the position (5,3) will be occupied by the segment that was before, but since segment 10 moves to (6,3), and segment 11 moves to (5,3), so (5,3) is always occupied by some body part until the tail moves past it.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,5), which is far.\n> \n> To vacate (5,3), I need the tail to move away from that area, but tail is at (4,5), and (5,3) is below.\n> \n> Let's see the snake shape. Snake is coiled: head (4,6), then left to (3,6), down to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), then right to (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), up to (6,3), left to (5,3), up to (5,4), left to (4,4), up to (4,5).\n> \n> So it's a bit messy.\n> \n> Position (5,3) is part of the body, and to vacate it, I need to move the snake so that the segment at (5,3) moves and no other segment comes there immediately, but since the snake is connected, it might be hard.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a way that the tail moves, but tail is at (4,5), which is not near (5,3).\n> \n> The cell (5,3) can be vacated if the segment that is there moves away and the next segments don't occupy it immediately.\n> \n> Currently, segment 10 at (5,3). When I move, segment 10 will move to where segment 9 is, which is (6,3), so new position for that segment is (6,3). Then the cell (5,3) will be occupied by the segment that moves into it, which is segment 11, from (5,4) to (5,3)? Old segment 11 is at (5,4), so when snake moves, segment 11 moves to old segment 10 position, which is (5,3).\n> \n> So after move, (5,3) is occupied by new segment 11 (which was old segment 11).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move again, it might change.\n> \n> To have (5,3) empty, I need a move where no segment is moving to it, which means that the segment that was behind must not be moving to that position.\n> \n> Since the snake moves forward, each position is taken by the next segment.\n> \n> The only way to vacate a body-occupied cell is to have the tail move away from it, so that over time, as the snake moves, the position is left empty.\n> \n> For (5,3), it is currently occupied, and it will be occupied until the tail passes that area, but tail is at (4,5), and (5,3) is not on the path to tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,5), and to move the tail, I need to move the head, so the tail position changes.\n> \n> But (5,3) is a fixed point, I need the snake to move such that all segments leave the (5,3) cell.\n> \n> Currently, after each move, some segment is at (5,3) until the snake configuration changes.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head down to (4,5), as above, then new positions have new seg11 at (5,3).\n> \n> If I then move again, say from new head (4,5), what can I do.\n> \n> New head at (4,5) after move D.\n> \n> Direction: I moved D, so new direction is D.\n> \n> From (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but not U because U would be reverse? Current direction D, so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> Possible: D (down to (4,4)? (4,4) is new seg13? After move, positions: head (4,5), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (3,2), seg7 (4,2), seg8 (5,2), seg9 (6,2), seg10 (6,3), seg11 (5,3), seg12 (5,4), tail seg13 (4,4)\n> \n> So (4,4) is tail.\n> \n> From head (4,5), move D to (4,4): (4,4) is tail, so safe.\n> \n> Move L to (3,5): (3,5) is seg3, body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Move R to (5,5): is (5,5) free? Not occupied, not wall, so ok.\n> \n> Move U to (4,6): but (4,6) is seg1, body, and also U is reverse of D, so invalid.\n> \n> So from (4,5) with direction D, possible moves: D to (4,4) tail, or R to (5,5) empty.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,4), then head to tail, but no food, so snake grows? No, if no food eaten, tail moves off.\n> \n> New head (4,4), but (4,4) was tail, so when head moves to tail position, and no food, it's ok, tail moves away.\n> \n> Positions: new head (4,4), new seg1 (4,5), new seg2 (4,6), etc.\n> \n> Then (5,3) is still there, occupied by seg11.\n> \n> I need to move towards the tail area to shorten or something, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Since (5,3) has food, and it's under body, I can move in a way that the body leaves it soon.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (5,3) is index 10. When the snake moves, this segment will move to (6,3) if I move right, or to other places.\n> \n> But the cell (5,3) will be taken by the next segment.\n> \n> The only way to vacate it is to have the tail approach so that when the segment moves, no one takes its place, but that only happens if it's the tail.\n> \n> But (5,3) is not tail.\n> \n> So for a body-occupied food, it will be vacated when the snake moves such that that position is no longer occupied, which happens when the segment that was there moves and the following segment doesn't move into it because the snake is turning or something.\n> \n> In this case, from the current position, if I move the head in a certain way.\n> \n> Perhaps I should aim for the food at (5,1), which is free and has long life span.\n> \n> (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, which is near the bottom.\n> \n> Current head at (4,6), so I need to go down.\n> \n> Also, there is internal obstacle at (6,4), etc.\n> \n> But let's think about the grid.\n> \n> List all blocked cells: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So for example, (1,1) is obstacle, so (2,1) food can be accessed from (2,2), but as we said, not reachable in time.\n> \n> (5,1) food at (5,1), y=1, so above wall y=0.

It's turn 57, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles are at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So, I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,5), and the body segments follow: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 13: (4,4)\n> \n> The snake has 14 segments? Let's count: positions from index 0 to 13, that's 14 cells. Head at index 0, tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Snake head direction is D (down). So, it's moving downward, which means from (4,5) to... current head is at (4,5), and direction is D, so it was moving down to (4,5)? Direction is the current movement direction. Since it's D, the snake is facing down, so last move was down to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 2\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now, but since it decreases each turn, on turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So, at turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears when life span becomes 0? Or after N turns, meaning on turn t + N it disappears?\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L more turns. So, for example, on turn 57, food with life span 2 will be available for this turn and the next, and disappear on turn 59? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on turn t, when we process, the life span decreases by 1 for that turn. So, if life span is L at the beginning of turn t, after turn t, it becomes L-1. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (2,1): life span 2 on turn 57. After turn 57, life span becomes 1. After turn 58, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 57 or 58.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): life span 5, available for 5 turns starting from turn 57, so can be eaten on turns 57,58,59,60,61.\n> \n> (5,1): life span 8, available for 8 turns.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5)\n> \n> Direction: D (down)\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5): Since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right? But no instant reverse, so I cannot move up (opposite of down). So possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (4,4)\n> \n> - Left (L) to (3,5)\n> \n> - Right (R) to (5,5)\n> \n> Now, I need to check if these cells are safe.\n> \n> First, (4,4): what is at (4,4)? From snake positions, (4,4) is the tail! It's the last segment. But moving to tail is allowed because when I move, the tail will move away, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): from snake positions, (3,5) is segment 3. Let's list positions again:\n> \n> Snake: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> So (4,5) is head.\n> \n> (4,6) is next.\n> \n> (3,6) is next.\n> \n> (3,5) is segment index 3.\n> \n> (3,4) is index 4.\n> \n> (3,3) index 5.\n> \n> (3,2) index 6.\n> \n> (4,2) index 7.\n> \n> (5,2) index 8.\n> \n> (6,2) index 9.\n> \n> (6,3) index 10.\n> \n> (5,3) index 11.\n> \n> (5,4) index 12.\n> \n> (4,4) index 13, tail.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (4,5):\n> \n> - D to (4,4): this is the tail position. But since tail will move, it's okay unless it causes immediate collision or something. Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So moving to tail is safe as long as after move, the tail moves.\n> \n> - L to (3,5): (3,5) is a body segment, index 3. Not tail, so moving there would cause collision because it's a body part that won't move away immediately.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and all body segments shift, so the segment that was at (3,5) will move to where (3,4) was or something? Let's think.\n> \n> After move, the new head position is set, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if I move to (3,5), which is currently occupied by a body segment, after the move, that body segment will have moved to a different position, so the cell (3,5) will be free except for the head moving there. But when the head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment, it collides only if that segment is still there, but since the snake moves simultaneously, the body segment moves out as the head moves in.\n> \n> Standard Snake rules: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it collides unless that segment is the tail and it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is not the tail; it's the fourth segment or something. Index: head at (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So (3,5) is the third body segment after head? Positions: index 0: (4,5) head, index 1: (4,6), index 2: (3,6), index 3: (3,5), etc.\n> \n> If I move left to (3,5), which is index 3, not the tail. After move, the head will be at (3,5), but the segment that was at (3,5) will move to the next position. Since the head moves to (3,5), and the segment that was at (3,5) will move to where the previous segment was, but let's simulate.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0:(4,5), 1:(4,6), 2:(3,6), 3:(3,5), 4:(3,4), etc.\n> \n> If I move left to (3,5): new head position (3,5).\n> \n> Then, the body segments: segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,5)? No.\n> \n> When head moves, the new head is at the new position, then segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position, and so on.\n> \n> So after moving left:\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was index 1 at (4,6)) moves to old head (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (3,6)) moves to old segment 1 position (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (3,5)) moves to old segment 2 position (3,6)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> But the new head is at (3,5), which was the position of segment 3. But after the move, segment 3 has moved to (3,6), so the cell (3,5) is now occupied only by the head, no collision because the body segment moved away.\n> \n> Collision happens if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that doesn't move away, but in this case, since all segments shift, the only issue is if the head moves to a position that will still be occupied after the move, but for body segments except tail, they move to a new position.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that is not the tail, it should be fine because that segment will move to a different cell.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> It doesn't say anything about other body segments, but in standard Snake, moving to a body segment position causes collision only if that segment doesn't move, but since it does, it should be okay except for the tail in some cases, but tail is special.\n> \n> I think for non-tail body segments, when the head moves to that cell, that segment moves away, so no collision. Only if the head moves to a position that remains occupied, like if it's a body segment that doesn't move, but in the shift, all segments move except that the new position is set.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,5), it is currently occupied by segment 3. After move, segment 3 moves to (3,6), and head moves to (3,5), so (3,5) is now head, and no body there, so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to a cell that is the tail, it might be safe if the tail moves.\n> \n> But in this case, for (3,5), it's not tail, so moving there should be fine.\n> \n> Let's confirm with the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: (4,5) head, (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), etc.\n> \n> After move L to (3,5):\n> \n> - Head now at (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (4,6)) moves to (4,5)  // old head position\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (3,6)) moves to (4,6)  // old segment 1 position\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (3,5)) moves to (3,6)  // old segment 2 position\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (3,4)) moves to (3,5)? No, segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position, which was (3,5), but (3,5) is now head, so segment 4 moves to (3,5)? No.\n> \n> The movement: the positions update as:\n> \n> - New position 0: (3,5)  // new head\n> \n> - Position 1: old position 0 = (4,5)\n> \n> - Position 2: old position 1 = (4,6)\n> \n> - Position 3: old position 2 = (3,6)\n> \n> - Position 4: old position 3 = (3,5)  // but this is where new head is, conflict.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard way: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell. Then, each body segment from 1 to end moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, for segment i, it moves to where segment i-1 was before the move.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> - P0: (4,5)  // head\n> \n> - P1: (4,6)\n> \n> - P2: (3,6)\n> \n> - P3: (3,5)\n> \n> - P4: (3,4)\n> \n> - etc.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5):\n> \n> - New P0: (3,5)  // new head\n> \n> - Then, segment 1 (old P1) moves to old P0, which is (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (old P2) moves to old P1, which is (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (old P3) moves to old P2, which is (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (old P4) moves to old P3, which is (3,5)  // but (3,5) is now the new head position, so segment 4 would move to (3,5), which is occupied by the head, so collision!\n> \n> Yes, that's the issue. If the head moves to a position that was occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, that segment will move to the new head position or something? In this case, segment 4 is moving to old P3, which is (3,5), but (3,5) is now the head, so when segment 4 moves there, it collides with the head.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to any body segment position except the tail will cause collision because that segment will try to move to the same cell or something.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by segment K, then after the move, segment K will move to the position of segment K-1, but the new head is at that cell, so if K is not the last segment, it will be a problem.\n> \n> But in the case where K is the tail, it's different because the tail moves away and doesn't occupy that cell anymore.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> For non-tail segments, it's deadly.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,5), it is occupied by segment 3, which is not the tail (tail is at (4,4), index 13). So moving to (3,5) would cause collision because segment 3 will not be there, but segment 4 will move to where segment 3 was, which is the new head position? Let's clarify.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5):\n> \n> - New head at (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to old head (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position, which was (3,5), but (3,5) is now occupied by the head, so when segment 4 moves to (3,5), it collides with the head at (3,5).\n> \n> Therefore, moving to any body cell except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> Only moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,4), which is the tail, moving there is safe.\n> \n> For (5,5), what is there?

The grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls include the borders and internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 13: (5,4)\n> \n> The snake has 14 segments? Positions list has 14 elements: from index 0 to 13, so yes, 14 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is R (right), meaning the snake was moving right to get to (5,5) from (4,5)? Positions: previous head was (4,5), now head at (5,5), so it moved right to (5,5) from (4,5). Current direction is R, so it can move U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.

Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 58, if life_span is 1, it will disappear at the end of turn 58 if not eaten. So for food with life_span 1, I need to eat it this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> Life_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.

No.\n> \n> The head moves to the new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So new positions: head to (5,4), then S1 moves to where head was, (5,5), S2 moves to where S1 was, (4,5), S3 to (4,6), and so on, up to S12 moves to where S11 was, S11 was (6,3), S12 was (5,3), so S12 moves to (6,3), S13 moves to where S12 was, (5,3).\n> \n> S13 was (5,4), but since head moved to (5,4), and S13 is the tail, it moves to S12's old position.\n> \n> After move, the cell (5,4) is now head, and the tail was at (5,4), but it moves, so the cell is free before movement? During movement, head moves to (5,4), which was occupied by tail, but tail leaves, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if there is food at (5,4), and I move there, I eat it and grow, so tail doesn't move, new tail is added.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,4) is tail, but there is no food there; food is at other places.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (5,5):\n> \n> - U: to (5,6) — free? y=6, x=5. Walls: not border, not internal obstacle. Body: not occupied, so free. Safe.\n> \n> - D: to (5,4) — currently occupied by tail S13. But after move, tail moves away, so no collision, and no food there, so safe.\n> \n> - R: to (6,5) — x=6, y=5. Walls: x=7 is border, but x=6 is not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, so not wall. Body: is (6,5) occupied? Positions: (6,2), (6,3), but not (6,5), so free. (6,3) is there, (6,5) is different. So (6,5) should be free and safe.\n> \n> Now, all three moves seem possible, but I need to consider the food and plan ahead.\n> \n> Food all with life_span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (2,1) value 1\n> \n> - (5,3) value 4, but (5,3) is currently occupied by snake body segment S12. So I can't eat it now because head can't move there directly; it's under body.\n> \n> - (5,1) value 7\n> \n> - (1,2) value 10\n> \n> (5,3) is under body, so to eat it, I need to move the body away first, but life_span is 1, so it disappears after this turn, so I can't eat it at all because I can't move head to (5,3) this turn since it's occupied. The rule says: food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it. But since life_span is 1, and I can't do that in one turn, it's impossible to eat (5,3) this turn. After this turn, it disappears, so (5,3) is not eatable; I should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (2,1), (5,1), (1,2) are all on free cells, I assume, but need to check if they are accessible.\n> \n> (2,1): x=2,y=1. Walls: (1,1) is wall, but (2,1) not wall, so free. Is it occupied? Snake not there, so yes.\n> \n> (5,1): x=5,y=1. Walls: (3,1) is wall, but (5,1) not, so free. Snake not there.\n> \n> (1,2): x=1,y=2. Walls: (1,1) is wall, (1,6) wall, but (1,2) not listed as wall, and borders x=0,y=0 etc., but (1,2) is within, x=1 not border unless x=0 or7, so should be free. But (1,1) is wall, so (1,2) might be accessible, but let's see if it's not wall. Internal obstacles include (1,1), but (1,2) not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> To eat food this turn, I need to move head to one of (2,1), (5,1), or (1,2), but they are far from (5,5).\n> \n> From (5,5), I can reach:\n> \n> - (2,1) is at distance |5-2| + |5-1| = 3+4=7, too far for one move.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is (5,1), from (5,5) down to (5,4), then (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied, and (5,2) is segment 9, etc., not direct.\n> \n> (5,1) is at (5,1), head at (5,5), so I can go down, but in one move, only to adjacent cells.\n> \n> This turn, turn 58, I can only move to adjacent cells: (5,6), (5,4), or (6,5).\n> \n> None of these have food; food is at (2,1), (5,1), (1,2), all not adjacent to (5,5).\n> \n> (5,1) is at y=1, head at y=5, so not adjacent.\n> \n> So this turn, I cannot eat any food because no food is adjacent to head, and the one at (5,3) is under body and not accessible.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat any food this turn; all food will disappear after this turn since life_span 1.\n> \n> But food at (5,3) has value 4, but it's under body, can't eat.\n> \n> Others are too far.\n> \n> So for turn 58, I need to move to a safe cell without eating food.\n> \n> Then, after this turn, all food is gone, so I need to think about future food, but no food is mentioned for future, only current food with life_span 1.\n> \n> The state only gives current food, so after this, if no new food, I just need to survive.\n> \n> But probably new food will spawn, but I don't know, so I need to plan a path that keeps me alive and explores.\n> \n> But for now, since no food can be eaten, I should choose a move that is safe and sets up for future.\n> \n> Also, the Tail Reward Danger: but not applicable now.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,5):\n> \n> - U to (5,6)\n> \n> - D to (5,4)\n> \n> - R to (6,5)\n> \n> All seem safe immediately.\n> \n> But let's see the surroundings.\n> \n> First, (5,6): above head.

It's turn 59, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3).

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: For (5,3), life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns, including the current turn, so if not eaten by turn 62, it's gone? Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 59, life span 4, it will disappear after turn 59 + 4 - 1? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be there for N turns: turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 59, life span 4, it will be available on turns 59, 60, 61, 62, and disappear at turn 63. Similarly, (5,1) life span 6: available turns 59 to 64, disappear at 65. (1,2) life span 9: available turns 59 to 67, disappear at 68.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,4), then body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Current head direction: D (down)\n> \n> Food: (5,3), (5,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Notice that (5,3) has food, but (5,3) is also the tail of the snake. So, according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but to eat it, the body must move away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically for tail: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see where head is: (5,4). Tail is at (5,3). So head at (5,4), tail at (5,3), which is directly below? y=4 and y=3, so if y increases upwards? Let's check coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so probably y increases upwards, like in math coordinates. U (up) increases y, D (down) decreases y.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (5,4), then (5,5) which is above (since y=5 > y=4), so moving down from (5,5) to (5,4), yes y decreasing.\n> \n> So (5,4) is below (5,5). Tail is at (5,3), which is below head.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), tail at (5,3), so they are adjacent vertically, head above tail.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) has food. If I move down to (5,3), I would eat the food, but according to \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills snake.\n> \n> Head at (5,4) is adjacent to tail at (5,3), since one cell away. And tail has food. So if I move down to (5,3), I eat the food, but then snake grows, so new tail is where the old tail was, but since head moves to (5,3), and after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so after moving, the head is at the new position, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place for that turn? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment. If no food eaten, tail moves away from its current position. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> But in this case, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, and that cell has food, eating it.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Specifically: after eating, the head is at the food cell, and since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail position, which is now occupied by the head? Confusing.\n> \n> Let me read the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this situation: head at (5,4), tail at (5,3). Head moves down to (5,3). Since (5,3) has food, snake eats it, so the head is now at (5,3), and since it ate, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move. Therefore, the segment that was at (5,3) is now part of the body, and the new tail is the segment that was second last, which is (6,3)? Let's see snake positions.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (3,5), 6: (3,4), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (5,2), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,3), 13: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> So tail is (5,3), and before tail is (6,3).\n> \n> If head moves down to (5,3), which has food. After move: head moves to (5,3), and since food eaten, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move. New positions: head at (5,3), then the old head (5,4) becomes body, and all segments shift, but since growth, the tail stays, so the body includes (5,4), (5,5), etc., and tail is still (5,3)? No.\n> \n> After moving to (5,3) and eating:\n> \n> - New head position: (5,3)\n> \n> - Because food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, so the previous tail (5,3) is now occupied by head, but the tail was at (5,3), so after head moves to (5,3), that cell is now head, and since we add a new segment, the tail remains at its previous position? I'm confused.\n> \n> Standard way: when snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> Start: positions: [H: (5,4), B1: (5,5), B2: (4,5), ..., B12: (6,3), T: (5,3)]\n> \n> If head moves down to (5,3):\n> \n> - Head moves to (5,3)\n> \n> - But (5,3) was tail, and has food.\n> \n> After move: head is at new position (5,3). Then, since food eaten, we add a new segment at the tail end. So the body segments: B1 moves to where head was (5,4), B2 to B1's old position (5,5), and so on, up to B12 moves to B11's old position? Let's index.\n> \n> Let positions be S[0] = head (5,4), S[1] = (5,5), S[2] = (4,5), S[3] = (4,6), S[4] = (3,6), S[5] = (3,5), S[6] = (3,4), S[7] = (3,3), S[8] = (3,2), S[9] = (4,2), S[10] = (5,2), S[11] = (6,2), S[12] = (6,3), S[13] = tail (5,3)\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, say to P.\n> \n> If P has food, then new head is P, and the body becomes S[0], S[1], ..., S[13], so the snake grows to 15 segments, with tail at S[13] which was (5,3).\n> \n> But S[13] was (5,3), and new head is also (5,3), so head and tail are at the same cell? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When head moves, S[0] moves to P.\n> \n> Then S[1] moves to old S[0], S[2] to old S[1], ..., S[k] to old S[k-1], for k from 1 to len-1.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail (S[len-1]) is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail is not removed, so snake length increases.\n> \n> In this case, head moves to P = (5,3).\n> \n> Old positions: S[0]=(5,4), S[1]=(5,5), ..., S[13]=(5,3)\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New S[0] = P = (5,3)\n> \n> - New S[1] = old S[0] = (5,4)\n> \n> - New S[2] = old S[1] = (5,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> - New S[13] = old S[12] = (6,3)  // since S[12] was (6,3)\n> \n> - And since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, so new S[14] = old S[13] = (5,3)\n> \n> But old S[13] was (5,3), and new S[0] is also (5,3), so now S[0] and S[14] are both at (5,3), which is a collision. Ah, yes, so the head and the new tail are at the same position, so the snake dies immediately.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to the tail cell when it has food causes instant death because head and tail occupy the same cell after growth.\n> \n> Similarly, if the head moves to any body cell, it collides, but in this case, specifically for tail with food, it's dangerous when adjacent.\n> \n> So in this state, head at (5,4), tail at (5,3) with food, so I cannot move down to (5,3) because that would kill me.\n> \n> Moving up to (5,5) is not possible because (5,5) is the body segment, and moving there would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Current head (5,4), body includes (5,5), (4,5), etc., so moving up to (5,5) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left or right or down.\n> \n> Available moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) - occupied by body, so invalid, collision\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) - has food, but tail is there, and moving there causes death as above\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) - is this free?

It's turn 60. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So I should avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Then: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> The head direction is \"L\", which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n> \n> Current turn is 60, so for food at (5,3): life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 62? Let's clarify: life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? I need to think carefully.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1. For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only on turn t. If L=2 at turn t, it disappears after turn t+1, so you can eat it on turn t or t+1.\n> \n> Here, at turn 60:\n> \n> - (5,3): life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 62.

Eaten on 60 to 67.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,4), direction left. Possible moves: since direction is left, I can move left, up, or down, but not right because of no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R on the next turn.\n> \n> Possible actions from (4,4):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,3)\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> First, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Now, (3,4) is a possible move left. Is (3,4) occupied? Snake body: let's list all snake positions to see if (3,4) is part of the body.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> (3,4) is in the list, it's the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,3), etc.\n> \n> (3,4) is a body segment. If I move left to (3,4), that would be a collision because the head would touch the body at (3,4). But is it safe? When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and the tail moves forward, so if I move to a cell that was the tail, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> The collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and after moving, the tail moves, so it's not occupied anymore, it should be safe.\n> \n> What is the tail? The last segment. Snake positions: the list is from head to tail, so tail is the last one: (6,3).\n> \n> Let's confirm the positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (4,4)\n> \n> 1: (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (5,5)\n> \n> 3: (4,5)\n> \n> 4: (4,6)\n> \n> 5: (3,6)\n> \n> 6: (3,5)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (3,3)\n> \n> 9: (3,2)\n> \n> 10: (4,2)\n> \n> 11: (5,2)\n> \n> 12: (6,2)\n> \n> 13: (6,3)  // this should be the tail, since it's the last in the list.\n> \n> The list has 14 positions? Count: positions from 0 to 13, so 14 segments.\n> \n> Length of snake: number of segments. Positions: 14 cells, so length 14.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> Now, if I move to (3,4), which is currently occupied by the body at index 7. Is this the tail? No, tail is (6,3), so (3,4) is a body segment, not the tail. Moving there would cause a collision because after movement, the head is at (3,4), but that cell was occupied by the body, and since the tail is at (6,3), moving to (3,4) would mean the head is on a body cell that doesn't move away immediately.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to the new cell, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (3,4), which was previously occupied by segment at index 7. After movement, the segment that was at index 7 will move to where index 6 was, and so on, down to the tail moving to where the second last was.\n> \n> But at the moment of movement, when the head moves to (3,4), that cell is now the head, and the old head position becomes part of the body, but the cell (3,4) was occupied, so it's a collision unless it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and after moving, the tail moves away, so it's safe. But if it's any other body segment, it's a collision because that segment doesn't move away; it only shifts when the snake moves, but the head is now on a cell that was and will be occupied.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at time t, positions: head at H, body segments at B1, B2, ..., Bk, tail at T.\n> \n> If I move head to a new position N.\n> \n> - If N is not occupied by any body segment, it's safe.\n> \n> - If N is occupied by the tail T, then after moving, head is at N (which was T), and the tail moves to the position of the second last segment, so N is now head, and tail is elsewhere, no collision.\n> \n> - If N is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, say Bi, then after moving, head is at N, but Bi was at N, and it will move to the next position, but at the same time, the head occupies N, so there is a collision because two parts are on the same cell.\n> \n> The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" except when it's the tail and it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,4) is a body segment, index 7, which is not the tail. Tail is index 13, (6,3). So moving to (3,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - Left (L) to (3,4): but (3,4) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision. Invalid.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (4,5): what is at (4,5)? Snake positions: (4,5) is index 3, body segment. Not tail, so moving there would be collision. Tail is (6,3), so (4,5) is not tail. Invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (4,3): is (4,3) occupied? Looking at snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). (4,3) is not in the list, so it's empty. Also, not a wall? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,3) is within bounds, x=4 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=4 is fine, y=3 fine. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), none at (4,3). So (4,3) is free. So down to (4,3) is possible.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so moving down is allowed, not reverse.\n> \n> So only possible move from here is down to (4,3)? But what about other directions?\n> \n> From (4,4), possible moves: U, D, L, but L and U are blocked by body, only D is free? But direction is L, so I can also move U or D, but not R.\n> \n> U to (4,5) is occupied, L to (3,4) occupied, D to (4,3) free. So only one choice? But that seems odd.\n> \n> (4,5) is occupied, (3,4) occupied, (4,3) free. What about right? But right is reverse, since current direction is left, so I cannot move right immediately.

Walls: border x=7, y=7, etc. x=6, y=3, not border, since border x=0 and x=7, so x=6<7, ok. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is different. (6,4) is wall, (6,3) is not. So (6,3) free? But snake has (6,2), but not (6,3). Also, food? No food at (6,3). So (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (6,4) is wall, (6,3) is not. So yes, (6,3) is empty.\n> \n> But moving to (6,3): is it safe? Not occupied, so ok.\n> \n> (5,4): in positions, (5,4) is segment 3 or something, not tail.

It's turn 61, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since the borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) is listed, but (1,1) might be a wall since it's internal? No, internal obstacles are separate. (1,1) is given as an internal obstacle, so it's not playable.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,3), and direction is D (down). Let me list the snake segments:\n> \n> - Head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n> \n> That's 14 segments.

Down means decreasing y, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume. Let's check.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) – so if y increases, it's up, so (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually in such games, (0,0) is top-left, with y increasing down, but here U is (x,y+1), which might imply y+1 is up if we think of y=0 as bottom.\n> \n> I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.

This is possible because of the rule: food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is food, but let's see if snake is on it. Head is at (4,3), so (5,3) might be free or occupied? Snake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), etc. – no (5,3) listed, so (5,3) is not occupied by snake, I think.

Let's see.\n> \n> Life_span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will last until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 61, food with life_span 2: countdown starts at 2, decreases to 1 on turn 62, and to 0 on turn 63? But disappears after N turns, so after turn 61 + 2 = turn 63 it should be gone, but let's read.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span L, at turn t, countdown = L, then turn t+1, countdown = L-1, ..., turn t + L - 1, countdown =1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not present on turn t + L.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,3) at turn 61, life_span 2: present on turns 61 and 62, disappears on turn 63.\n> \n> (5,1) life_span 4: present turns 61,62,63,64, disappears turn 65.\n> \n> (1,2) life_span 7: turns 61 to 67, disappear 68.\n> \n> (4,2) life_span 10: turns 61 to 70, disappear 71.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), direction down. Down is (x,y-1)? Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so assuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left?\n> \n> U (x,y+1) likely means increasing y is up, so (0,0) is bottom-left, y increasing up.\n> \n> But let's see the positions. For example, head at (4,3) moving down, down is D: (x,y-1), so to (4,2).\n> \n> But (4,2) is a body segment, but when snake moves, the tail moves, so if head moves to (4,2), which is currently occupied by the body, but since it's the tail that will move, it might be ok, as long as it's not the head colliding with body except the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is not the tail; the tail is (6,2). Positions: head (4,3), then ... (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) – so (6,2) is tail.\n> \n> (4,2) is a body segment, not tail. If head moves down to (4,2), it would collide with body at (4,2), which is not the tail, so it would die.\n> \n> But direction is down, and head at (4,3), moving down to (4,2) is not possible because (4,2) is occupied and not tail.\n> \n> Similarly, possible moves: from (4,3), adjacent cells: up (4,4), but (4,4) is body; left (3,3), which is body; right (5,3), which is free? (5,3) is not in snake positions, so free, and it has food.\n> \n> Down (4,2) is body.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: to (4,4) – but occupied by snake body, so collision, death.\n> \n> - D: to (4,2) – occupied by snake body, collision, death.\n> \n> - L: to (3,3) – occupied by snake body, collision, death.\n> \n> - R: to (5,3) – not occupied by snake, and not wall, so possible.\n> \n> (5,3) is within bounds? Walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Border walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> So (5,3): x=5, y=3, both between 1 and 6? y=1 to 6, I think, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) is internal, but x=1,y=1, not border, but obstacle.\n> \n> (5,3) is not in internal obstacles, and not border, so free.\n> \n> And snake not on it except the food, but food is separate.\n> \n> So from (4,3), only possible move is R to (5,3), because U, D, L are all body collisions.\n> \n> U to (4,4): position index 1 is (4,4), body.\n> \n> D to (4,2): index 11, (4,2), body.\n> \n> L to (3,3): index 9, (3,3), body.\n> \n> R to (5,3): not in positions, so free.\n> \n> Moreover, (5,3) has positive food with value 1.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3), I eat the food, so snake grows: length increases by one, so new head at (5,3), and tail doesn't move? When you eat, the snake grows, so the head moves to the food, but the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after moving to (5,3) and eating, the new positions would be: head at (5,3), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, so positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), ..., up to (6,2)] and since it ate, the tail (6,2) doesn't move, so length is now 15.\n> \n> Original length 14, after eating, length 15.\n> \n> But I need to think about the action sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> The problem is to think 5+ turns ahead and provide an action sequence starting from turn 61.\n> \n> Also, I have to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, at turn 61, from (4,3), only possible move is R to (5,3), right?

That might be under the body.\n> \n> Food: (4,2, 9, 1) — so (x,y) = (4,2), life span 9, value 1.\n> \n> But (4,2) is occupied by the snake body, as per positions.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is a cell, (1,2) is another.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 62, so for food at (5,1), life span 3, it will disappear after turn 64? Let's see: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone. Countdown decreases every turn, starting from current.\n> \n> So for (5,1), life span 3 at turn 62: after turn 62, countdown to 2; after turn 63, to 1; after turn 64, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 62, 63, 64, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 6: disappears after turn 67.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 9: disappears after turn 70.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake head at (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since current direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse, so from R, I can go U, D, R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells to head (5,3):\n> \n> - Up: (5,4) — but (5,4) is occupied by body? Positions: (5,4) is index 3 in the list, which is a body segment. So moving up to (5,4) would cause collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> - Down: (5,2) — (5,2) is index 13 in positions, body segment. Also collision.\n> \n> - Right: (6,3) — what is here? Let's see if it's wall or free.\n> \n> x=6,y=3. Walls: border x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (6,4) is an obstacle, but (6,3) is not listed, so should be free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,2) is tail, (5,2), (4,2), etc., no (6,3), so (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (4,3) — but (4,3) is index 1, body segment, and also, since current direction is R, moving left is reverse, which is not allowed. So cannot move L.\n> \n> So possible moves: only R to (6,3)? U and D are blocked by body, L is reverse and also body, so only possible move is R to (6,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Head at (5,3). Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North/U: (5,4) - occupied by body (index 3: (5,4))\n> \n> - South/D: (5,2) - occupied by body (index 13: (5,2))\n> \n> - East/R: (6,3) - not in walls, not in snake positions?

No (6,3), so free.\n> \n> - West/L: (4,3) - occupied by body (index 1: (4,3)), and also reverse direction, so invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, on this turn, the only possible move is R to (6,3). Otherwise, if I don't move, I die, but I have to move.\n> \n> So for turn 62, action must be R.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (6,3), the snake will have new head position (6,3), and the tail will move forward, so the segment at (6,2) might be freed if not eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's plan the sequence starting from turn 62.\n> \n> Turn 62: must move R to (6,3)\n> \n> Now, after this move, head at (6,3), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Snake positions: after moving to (6,3), the new head is (6,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes body, so positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] and tail (6,2) is gone?

It's turn 63, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,3) moving right (direction R). The body segments are listed: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So the tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 8, value +1. But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body, as per the positions list. (4,2) is the 14th segment in the list: positions are (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (4,2) is occupied by the snake, but food is listed there. That must be a special case where food spawns under the body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for (4,2), since it's under the snake, I can't eat it immediately; I need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is not occupied, and (1,2) is not occupied.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,3), direction right. So possible moves: I can go up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). But since current direction is right, I cannot instantly reverse to left; that would be moving opposite, which is not allowed. So L is invalid this turn.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R. R is right, which is the same direction.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. But walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6? Let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> Snake positions include (6,3), which is x=6, y=3; and (5,2), y=2, so y from 1 to 6? (3,1) is an obstacle, but y=1 is within bounds? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 should be playable, but internal obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - Border: x=0 or x=7 for any y, and y=0 or y=7 for any x. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7). But since it's coordinates, the playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) is a corner, but it's listed as internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is near border but internal.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3), moving right. Right would be to (7,3), but x=7 is a wall, so moving right is invalid because it would hit the wall.\n> \n> Confirm: head at (6,3), direction R. Moving R would be to (7,3). But x=7 is a wall, so that cell is occupied by wall, so I cannot move there. Therefore, R is not possible; it would cause a wall collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (5,3) but (5,3) is the second segment of the snake. Positions: head (6,3), then (5,3) is the next segment. But according to movement rules, I can move into the tail cell because the tail will move, but here (5,3) is not the tail; it's the neck, so moving left to (5,3) would be body collision except for the tail.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment other than the tail causes collision.\n> \n> Current snake positions: indices: 0: (6,3) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (4,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (3,5), 10: (3,4), 11: (3,3), 12: (3,2), 13: (4,2), 14: (5,2) tail.\n> \n> So tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, from head (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,3) — but (7,3) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> L: to (5,3) — which is body segment 1, not tail. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Tail is at (5,2), different cell. So (5,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move left.\n> \n> U: to (6,4) — what is at (6,4)? Not in snake positions? Snake has (6,3), (5,3), etc., no (6,4). But is there an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4) is listed! (6,4) is an internal obstacle. So (6,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> D: to (6,2) — what is at (6,2)? Not in snake positions? Positions have (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), but not (6,2). And no obstacle at (6,2)? Obstacles: border walls, and internal (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (6,2) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> y=2, x=6. Borders: x=6 is not border? x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x=6 is playable. y=2, not border. Internal obstacles don't include (6,2), so (6,2) should be empty.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But snake has (3,1), which is an obstacle, but (3,1) y=1, which is border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 should be playable except for obstacles.\n> \n> (3,1) is listed as internal obstacle, so it's blocked. Similarly, (1,1) internal obstacle.\n> \n> For (6,2): x=6, y=2. x=6 is not border (border x=0,7), y=2 not border. Not in internal obstacles list. So (6,2) is free.\n> \n> Now, moving down to (6,2) should be possible.\n> \n> But is there food or something? Not at (6,2), but it's a possible move.\n> \n> Current possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: (6,4) — but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (6,2) — appears free.\n> \n> - L: (5,3) — occupied by body segment 1, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (7,3) — wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that right? U to (6,4) is obstacle, L to (5,3) is body, R to (7,3) wall, so yes, only D is possible.\n> \n> But let's double-check the snake positions. Head at (6,3), next is (5,3), so (5,3) is directly adjacent and occupied. Down to (6,2): is (6,2) occupied? Snake positions: list ends with (5,2), which is (5,2), not (6,2). And no other, so (6,2) should be empty.\n> \n> Also, no food at (6,2), but that's fine.\n> \n> So for turn 63, I must move down, to (6,2).\n> \n> But the direction is given as R, but after moving down, direction changes.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximizing score, avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): value +1, life span 2. Current turn 63, so it disappears after turn 63 + 2 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (5,1) with life span 2: on turn 63, life span is 2, so after this turn, it decreases to 1, then on turn 64, it decreases to 0 and disappears? Or after how many turns?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" — let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for example, if food spawns at turn T with life span N, it will disappear at the end of turn T + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Countdown starts at N, decreases each turn including the spawn turn.\n> \n> After k turns, countdown is N - k.\n> \n> When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown = L.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown = L - 1 (if we decrease after the turn).\n> \n> The description says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but it doesn't specify when it decreases relative to the move.\n> \n> I think it's better to assume that at the beginning of the turn, the countdown is as given, and after the snake moves, it decreases.\n> \n> But for simplicity, since we're at turn 63, for food at (5,1) with life span 2, it has 2 turns left including this one. So after this turn (turn 63), it will have 1 left, and after turn 64, it will have 0 and disappear. So it can be eaten on turn 63 or 64, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,2) life span 5: can be eaten from turn 63 to 67.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) life span 8: can be eaten from turn 63 to 70.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by snake body, segment at position 13: (4,2). So I cannot eat it now; I need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (4,2), then I can move head to it.\n> \n> Now, current situation: I must move down to (6,2) on turn 63, as that's the only possible move.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), the snake will have new head at (6,2), and the tail will move, so the segment at (5,2) will be the new tail or something.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten at (6,2), moving to (6,2) doesn't eat food, so snake length remains the same, head moves to (6,2), body segments shift: the old head (6,3) becomes new segment 1, (5,3) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to the tail (5,2) is removed.\n> \n> Let's list the positions after move.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0:(6,3), 1:(5,3), 2:(4,3), 3:(4,4), 4:(5,4), 5:(5,5), 6:(4,5), 7:(4,6), 8:(3,6), 9:(3,5), 10:(3,4), 11:(3,3), 12:(3,2), 13:(4,2), 14:(5,2)\n> \n> After move down to (6,2): new head at (6,2). Then the body: segment 0 moves to where head was, but since head moves, the new segment 1 is the old position 0: (6,3). New segment 2 is old position 1: (5,3), and so on, up to new segment 14 is old position 13: (4,2), and the old tail (5,2) is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> The snake has 15 segments, so after move without eating, it should have 14 segments? No.\n> \n> Snake length: positions list has 15 elements, so length 15.\n> \n> After moving head to a new cell without food, the tail is removed, so new positions: head at (6,2), then the first body segment is at old head position (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2).

Internal obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (6,1) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> (5,2): is it occupied? Current positions: (6,2) head, (6,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2) tail. (5,2) is not in positions? Positions have (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), ..., (3,2), (4,2). (3,2) and (4,2) are there, but (5,2) is not occupied now, since tail was removed.\n> \n> After turn 63 move, positions are as above, so cells occupied: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2).

Let's think.\n> \n> When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: before move, head at (5,2), tail at (4,2).\n> \n> After moving head to (4,2), eating food, so new head at (4,2), and the tail remains at (4,2)? No, the tail is still at (4,2), but head is also at (4,2), so collision? No.\n> \n> The head moves to the new cell, and the body follows.\n> \n> Specifically: before move, positions: ..., (5,2) head, then body segments, but (5,2) is head, previous positions.\n> \n> Better to list.\n> \n> After turn 63, positions: head (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n> \n> On turn 64, if I move head to (5,2)? From (6,2) to (5,2) is left.\n> \n> But (5,2) is not occupied? In the list, (5,2) is not in positions; positions have (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2). No (5,2), so free.\n> \n> Move to (5,2): new head at (5,2), then body: (6,2) becomes new segment 1, (6,3) segment 2, (5,3) segment 3, and so on, up to (3,2) segment 13, (4,2) segment 14 tail. And no food eaten, so tail (4,2) remains, but the segment that was at (4,2) is now part of body.\n> \n> After move to (5,2) without eating: new positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail (4,2) is removed? No.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, the tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,2), then the first body segment is old head position (6,2), then old segment 1 (6,3), old segment 2 (5,3), old segment 3 (4,3), ..., up to old segment 13 (3,2), and old segment 14 (4,2) is the tail to be removed, so not included.

Wait, positions are given as a list, so (6,2) is head, (6,3) is next, down to (4,2) which might be the tail. But (4,2) is listed last, so tail should be (4,2). But let's confirm the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> So head at (6,2), then body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail at (4,2). (4,2) is the last one, so tail is (4,2).\n> \n> But (4,2) is also listed in the positions, and it's the tail. Now, head direction is down, which is D. So from (6,2), moving down would be to (6,1), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 64, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (5,1) with life span 1, on turn 64, it will disappear after this turn, meaning if not eaten on turn 64, it's gone. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,1): value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,2): value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (5,2): value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food here has value 1, so all positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> But (4,2) has food with life span 7? (4,2) is also the tail position of the snake. Let's see.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) with value 1, life span 7. But (4,2) is occupied by the snake's tail. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - (5,1): food, value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (1,2): food, value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,2): food, value 1, life span 7 — but this is currently occupied by the tail.\n> \n> - (5,2): food, value 1, life span 10\n> \n> (4,2) is tail, so food is under it, but to eat it, the tail must move away first, then head can move to (4,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is a free cell with food, I think. Is (5,2) occupied? Snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), etc., down to (4,2). So (5,2) is not in the snake positions, so it should be empty with food.\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> So cells occupied: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> Food at (5,1) — not occupied, so can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> (1,2) — not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (4,2) — occupied by tail, so food is under it, but not accessible until tail moves.\n> \n> (5,2) — not in snake positions, so free with food.\n> \n> Now, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so we can't go to those coordinates. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So forbidden cells: all with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Head is at (6,2), direction down. So possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be reverse? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move up on this turn. Possible moves: down to (6,1), left to (5,2), right to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so right is invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is border wall, so (7,2) is out of bounds, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1): y=1, not y=0, so it's within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are safe? Grid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are inside, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns x=0 and x=7 are all walls. Similarly, rows y=0 and y=7 are walls. So valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> For example, head at (6,2): x=6, y=2. Since x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so it's valid. Similarly, (6,1): x=6, y=1; y=1 is not y=0, so it should be valid? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall unless internal obstacle.\n> \n> Border walls: cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So (6,1) has y=1, which is not 0, so it's not a border wall. But is there internal obstacle? Internal obstacles listed: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (6,1) is not listed, so (6,1) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) should be free, etc.\n> \n> Back to moves from head (6,2) direction down.\n> \n> Possible actions: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)\n> \n> But no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction D, so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> So cannot move to (6,3), which is the body anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: down to (6,1)\n> \n> - L: left to (5,2)\n> \n> - R: right to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: down to (6,1) or left to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, (6,1): is it safe? Not occupied by snake, not wall, no obstacle. Food? There is food at (5,1) but not at (6,1). (6,1) has no food mentioned.\n> \n> (5,2) has food with value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Also, (5,1) has food with life span 1, so it must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> But (5,1) is not adjacent to head directly? Head at (6,2), adjacent cells: (6,1) down, (5,2) left, (7,2) invalid, (6,3) up but reverse and body.\n> \n> (5,1) is not adjacent; it's at (5,1), which is left and down from (6,2), so not directly reachable in one move.\n> \n> To reach (5,1), I need to go to (5,2) or (6,1) first.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food at (4,2) which is under the tail. Tail is at (4,2), so if the snake moves, the tail might move, but only if the snake doesn't eat, tail moves forward when not eating.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows, so tail doesn't move; new segment added at head.\n> \n> But here, food is under tail, so to eat it, the tail must leave that cell, and then head can move there.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,2), and it has food under it.\n> \n> Also, head is at (6,2), not adjacent to tail. Tail is at (4,2), head at (6,2), so positions: (6,2) head, then (6,3), etc., tail (4,2). Distance is not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head: (6,1), (5,2), (6,3) but (6,3) is body.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to head; it's two cells away horizontally.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible actions for turn 64.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> 1.

Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Head (5,1) neighbors: (5,2) up, (5,0) down (but y=0 wall), (4,1) left, (6,1) right but (6,1) is body.\n> \n> Tail (3,3) neighbors: (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3)\n> \n> (4,3) is body, since snake has (4,3) as a segment.\n> \n> Head and tail are not adjacent; they are far apart.\n> \n> So no issue with Tail Reward Danger for any food.\n> \n> Now, for moving to (5,2): it has food with value +1, life 8.

Walls: internal obstacles (3,1), (1,1), but (4,1) not listed, so should be free. No food there, I think.\n> \n> Food at (1,2), (4,2), (5,2), so (4,1) empty.\n> \n> - Right (R): but current direction is L, moving right would be instant reverse, not allowed. So cannot move right.\n> \n> So possible actions: U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their lifespans.\n> \n> Food at (1,2): life span 3, so disappears at the end of turn 68? Life span decreases every turn including current. So at turn 66, it has life 3, after turn 66, it becomes 2, after turn 67, it becomes 1, after turn 68, it disappears. So must be eaten by turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): life 5, after turn 66: 4, turn 67:3, ..., turn 70:0, disappears after turn 70.\n> \n> (5,2): life 8, after turn 66:7, ..., turn 73:0, disappears after turn 73.\n> \n> Now, current head position (5,1).\n> \n> If I move up to (5,2), I eat the food there immediately. Snake grows, so the new tail will be added after moving, but since I eat, the length increases.\n> \n> After eating, the snake will have 16 segments. Head moves to (5,2), and the tail doesn't move until next turn? When head moves to a food cell, it eats it, so the body doesn't move that turn, but the snake grows, meaning that after the move, the tail stays in place, so the new position will have head at (5,2), and the body segments: the old head (5,1) becomes part of body, so body includes (5,1), (6,1), etc., and tail is still (3,3) for now? Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell. If no food, tail moves one step, so length same. If food, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, positions: after move, the new head position is added, and if food eaten, the last segment (tail) is not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> If no food, last segment is removed.\n> \n> Here, for turn 66, if I move to (5,2) which has food, I eat it, so after move, head is at (5,2), body includes (5,1) (which was head), then (6,1), (6,2), ..., up to (3,3), and since I ate food, tail doesn't move, so the snake has 16 segments now.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (4,1), no food there, so head moves to (4,1), body: (5,1) becomes body, then (6,1), ..., and tail (3,3) moves? When no food, tail moves off, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> After moving to (4,1) with no food: head at (4,1), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), ..., up to (3,4), and (3,3) is removed? The positions shift.\n> \n> Let's not get bogged down; I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Now, prioritize long-term survival and maximize score.\n> \n> I have three foods: (1,2) must be eaten soon, life only 3 turns left. (4,2) has more time, (5,2) has plenty.\n> \n> But (5,2) is adjacent to head, so easy to eat now.\n> \n> If I eat (5,2) now, I get +1, but the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver later, especially in this tight space.\n> \n> Look at the snake positions; it's coiled around. For example, from (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3), etc.\n> \n> After eating (5,2), head at (5,2), and body includes (5,1), so the cell (5,2) was food, now occupied.\n> \n> Then next turn, from (5,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction after move: if I move up to (5,2), the new direction is U (since I moved up from (5,1)).\n> \n> After moving, the head direction changes.\n> \n> For turn 66, if I move U to (5,2), then for turn 67, head at (5,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is body?

Direction is U, so moving D is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> L to (4,2), which has food? (4,2) has food with life 5.\n> \n> R to (6,2), which is body, occupied.\n> \n> So from (5,2) with direction U, possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,3): occupied by body, invalid\n> \n> - D to (5,1): occupied by body, invalid and also reverse\n> \n> - L to (4,2): possible, and has food\n> \n> - R to (6,2): occupied by body, invalid\n> \n> So only possible move is left to (4,2).\n> \n> Then I would eat the food at (4,2) on turn 67.\n> \n> Then similarly, from there.\n> \n> But let's see the state after turn 66 if I move U.\n> \n> After turn 66 move U to (5,2) and eat food:\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) — 16 segments, tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Food: (1,2) still there with life now 2 (after turn 66), (4,2) still there, but I will move to it next? On turn 67, I move to (4,2) as above.\n> \n> Assume I move L to (4,2) on turn 67.\n> \n> Then head to (4,2), which has food, eat it. So now head (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), ..., up to (3,3), and tail stays, 17 segments.\n> \n> But (4,2) was food, eaten.\n> \n> Now food left: (1,2) with life span decreasing.\n> \n> After moving to (4,2), direction is L (since moved left from (5,2)).\n> \n> Then turn 68, head at (4,2), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,3), but (4,3) is body?

Similarly, (1,6), etc.\n> \n> So, cells occupied by walls include border and these internal points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is (5,2), and direction is U (up). So, moving up.\n> \n> Snake body: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n> \n> That's 16 segments. Head at (5,2), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 67, life span 2, so it will be gone after turn 68? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,2): life span 2 at turn 67. After turn 67, countdown to 1. After turn 68, countdown to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 67 or 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): value 1, life span 4. At turn 67, life span 4, so available for 4 turns: 67,68,69,70. Disappears after turn 70.\n> \n> (5,6): value 1, life span 10. Available for 10 turns.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food? The value is given: for (1,2) it's 1, which is positive, similarly others. No negative food here.\n> \n> Food positions: (1,2,2,1) – I think this is (x,y, life_span, value), so (1,2) with life span 2, value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2,4,1) : (4,2) life span 4, value 1\n> \n> (5,6,10,1) : (5,6) life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 67.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So cannot move down immediately. Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Also, walls at borders, so cells like (1,1) is obstacle, but (1,1) is listed, so it's blocked.\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 – but these are walls, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) might be considered border, but it's explicitly listed as internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is corner, blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions occupied by snake.\n> \n> At turn 67, snake occupies: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> I should list all occupied cells to avoid.\n> \n> Also, for movement, when snake moves, the tail moves, so cells become free.\n> \n> Current head at (5,2), moving U would be to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by snake body? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (5,2)\n> \n> 1: (5,1)\n> \n> 2: (6,1)\n> \n> 3: (6,2)\n> \n> 4: (6,3)\n> \n> 5: (5,3)  <-- this is the 5th segment\n> \n> 6: (4,3)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So (5,3) is occupied by the body. If head moves up to (5,3), it would collide with body, since (5,3) is not the tail; tail is (3,3).\n> \n> Tail is the last segment, (3,3).\n> \n> General rule: moving to a cell occupied by body is deadly, except if it's the tail cell, because tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is not the tail; it's the 5th segment. So moving to (5,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,3) – but (5,3) is occupied by snake body (segment 5), so collision, not safe.\n> \n> - Down (D): but current direction is U, and D is opposite, so cannot move down because of no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,2)\n> \n> Now, (4,2): is it occupied?\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), ... so (4,2) is not in the list? Let's check all: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> No (4,2). So (4,2) is free? But is there an obstacle or wall?\n> \n> Walls: borders are blocked, but (4,2) is x=4,y=2, which is within 1-6, and not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (4,2) not there.\n> \n> So (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): but (6,2) is occupied by snake segment 3: (6,2) is in the list.\n> \n> Positions: segment 3 is (6,2), so occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (4,2): free, no obstacle\n> \n> - R to (6,2): but occupied, collision\n> \n> - U to (5,3): occupied, collision\n> \n> - D: not allowed, opposite direction\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (4,2).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Current head (5,2), direction U.\n> \n> Move L: to (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) not in snake positions, not in walls or obstacles, so should be safe.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food. But at (4,2) there is food? Food positions: (1,2), (4,2), (5,6)\n> \n> (4,2) has food! With value 1 and life span 4.\n> \n> So if I move to (4,2), I eat the food, snake grows.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,2) is positive, so eating it is good, but I need to think about risks.\n> \n> First, is it safe to move to (4,2)? Yes, as above.\n> \n> But let's see the tail position. Tail is at (3,3). After moving to (4,2) and eating food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added where the tail was? Standard snake: when you eat, the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, head moves to (4,2), eats food, so new head position (4,2), and the body follows, but since it eats, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail end. So positions: new head at (4,2), then previous head (5,2) becomes body, and so on, tail remains (3,3) for now? Let's think.\n> \n> Normally, when snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, tail moves away, so the cell where tail was is freed.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to new position with food, tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Here: current snake: positions from head to tail: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> If I move left to (4,2) and eat food there, then new head is (4,2), and the snake grows, so the body now includes the previous head and all segments, and tail stays. So new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2) (previous head), then (5,1), (6,1), etc., up to tail (3,3). So length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, the cell (4,2) was free, but now occupied by head.\n> \n> After this move, what is the new direction? Since I moved left, the new head direction should be L.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> But first, at turn 67, I must move, and only possible safe move is to (4,2), since U and R are blocked, D not allowed.\n> \n> Is that true?\n> \n> What about other directions? U is to (5,3) which is occupied, R to (6,2) occupied, D not allowed, so yes, only L to (4,2) is possible.\n> \n> But let me double-check if (4,2) is safe.\n> \n> (4,2) is not in snake positions: list has (4,3), (4,4), etc., but (4,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Not an obstacle.\n> \n> And it has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,3), head moving to (4,2). Are they adjacent?\n> \n> (3,3) and (4,2): distance? x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent horizontally or vertically; it's diagonal. Adjacency means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (3,3) and (4,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not considered adjacent for this rule.\n> \n> Therefore, safe to eat.\n> \n> So for turn 67, action must be L.\n> \n> Now, after this move, new state at turn 68.\n> \n> Turn 68: snake has eaten, so new positions: head at (4,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) and tail still (3,3)? No.\n> \n> When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added, meaning the tail remains in place, so positions: head (4,2), body: previous head (5,2) now first body, then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to (3,3), and since eaten, tail is still (3,3), but now the last segment is (3,3), and length is 17.\n> \n> List: positions after move:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,2)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,1)  // index 1 before\n> \n> - Segment 3: (6,1)  // index 2 before\n> \n> - Segment 4: (6,2)  // index 3 before\n> \n> - Segment 5: (6,3)  // index 4 before\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,3)  // index 5 before\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,3)  // index 6 before\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,4)  // index 7 before\n> \n> - Segment 9: (5,4)  // index 8 before\n> \n> - Segment 10: (5,5)  // index 9 before\n> \n> - Segment 11: (4,5)  // index 10 before\n> \n> - Segment 12: (4,6)  // index 11 before\n> \n> - Segment 13: (3,6)  // index 12 before\n> \n> - Segment 14: (3,5)  // index 13 before\n> \n> - Segment 15: (3,4)  // index 14 before\n> \n> - Segment 16: (3,3)  // index 15 before, and since eaten, this is now segment 16?

From (4,2) to (1,2) is |dx|=3, so need at least three moves, but at t68, after move, if I go left, I can be at (3,2), then at t69, to (2,2), then t70 to (1,2), but by t70, the food is gone because at t68 it has life span 1, so after t68, it disappears if not eaten.

Let me confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) and (1,6) are on the border, but since borders are walls, (1,1) might be considered separately, but it's listed as an internal obstacle, so I think all these are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), direction L, so moving left. Body segments: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]. That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since current turn is 68, it will be gone on turn 69.\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 1 and life span 9, so it disappears after 9 turns, on turn 77 (68 + 9 = 77? Let's see: turn 68 current, after turn 68, life span decreases to 0, so if not eaten by turn 68, it vanishes before turn 69. Similarly for (5,6), life span 9, so after 9 turns, on turn 77, it should vanish? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 68, for (1,2), life span is 1, so after turn 68, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 68. Similarly, (5,6) has life span 9, so it will be there until turn 68 + 8 = 76? Let's clarify the life span mechanics.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after L more turns. Specifically:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span is L. After turn t, it decreases to L-1.\n> \n> - It can be eaten during turn t, t+1, ..., up to turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span decreases every turn including current, that means at the start of turn t, life span is L. If eaten during turn t, it's consumed. If not, at the end of turn t, life span becomes L-1. So for food to be available, life span must be >=1 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> For (1,2): at turn 68, life span=1, so it can be eaten on turn 68. After turn 68, if not eaten, life span=0, gone.\n> \n> For (5,6): life span=9, so it can be eaten from turn 68 to turn 76 inclusive? Turn 68: life span=9, available; turn 69: life span=8, available; ... turn 76: life span=1, available; after turn 76, life span=0, gone. So it disappears before turn 77.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction L, so moving left. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move R on this turn. So possible actions: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, grid: let me sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x and y from 0 to 7, but (0,y) and (7,y) for y=0 to 7 are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But since x=0 and x=7 are walls, the columns are from x=1 to x=6? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> For example, snake positions: (4,2), (5,2), etc., all between 1 and 6, so yes, playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,1) is corner, but since borders are walls, (1,1) might be considered internal or border? But it's listed separately, so I think (1,1) is an obstacle cell, same as walls. Similarly, (1,6) is on top row, but internal obstacle. Anyway, all these cells are blocked.\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. But since playable area is only (1,1) to (6,6), we care about that.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) and (1,6) are on the border, but since x=1 is not wall, y=1 not wall except corners, but here (1,1) is specifically an obstacle, so it's blocked. Similarly for (1,6).\n> \n> Also, snake body occupies cells: let's list occupied cells to avoid collision.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> So body segments: from (5,2) to (3,3), all occupied except the head will move.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,2) and (5,6)\n> \n> (1,2) is at row 1, column 2? Coordinates: (x,y), so (1,2) is x=1,y=2.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) is x=5,y=6.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,2), direction L, so if I move L, to (3,2). Is (3,2) safe? Let's see.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - L: to (3,2)\n> \n> - U: to (4,3)\n> \n> - D: to (4,1)\n> \n> Now, check each for collision:\n> \n> (3,2): is it wall or body?\n> \n> Walls: borders, but (3,2) is within 1-6, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (3,2) is not listed, so should be free? Obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), etc., (3,2) not there. Snake body: positions are (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). (3,2) is not in this list, so it should be empty. Head is at (4,2), which will move, so (3,2) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (4,3): (4,3) is a body segment? Snake positions: (4,3) is the 8th segment? List: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), so (4,3) is occupied by body. If I move to (4,3), head collides with body, death.\n> \n> D to (4,1): (4,1) is it within bounds? x=4,y=1, y=1 is the bottom row, but not border wall? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable, but internal obstacle? Obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed. Snake body: (5,1) is body, but (4,1) not occupied. So (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm walls: y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall, but (4,1) is at y=1, which is fine. Internal obstacles: (3,1) is at (3,1), so (4,1) is different cell.\n> \n> Also, is there a wall? No, only the obstacles listed.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (3,2), U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, so collision, not possible. D to (4,1) seems free.\n> \n> U to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by snake body, so if I move there, head touches body, death. So invalid move.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (4,1): not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> L to (3,2): not occupied, not wall, possible.\n> \n> R is not possible because opposite direction.\n> \n> So only L and D are possible? U is invalid because of body.\n> \n> But direction is L, so U and D are perpendicular, not opposite, so allowed, but U leads to body.\n> \n> So from (4,2), possible safe moves: L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, food: (1,2) is at (1,2), which is left of (3,2). From (4,2), L to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (1,2). But (1,2) has life span 1, only available this turn. So if I want to eat it, I need to be at (1,2) on this turn, but I'm at (4,2), so I can't reach it this turn; it's too far. Distance: from (4,2) to (1,2) is 3 cells left, but I can only move one cell per turn, so I need 3 moves to reach it, but it disappears after this turn, so I can't eat it. Therefore, (1,2) is not achievable; it will vanish.\n> \n> Other food: (5,6) at x=5,y=6. Life span 9, so I have time.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's list the current snake body to understand the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,2), then segments: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> Tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> After each move, the snake moves forward, so the tail moves as well, except when eating food, it grows.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: from (4,2), I can go L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (3,2), new head (3,2), direction now L.

is chosen to safely navigate towards the positive food at (5,6) while avoiding immediate risks, such as the dead end at (4,1). Moving left to (3,2) on turn 68 is the only safe option, as moving down to (4,1) leads to certain death on the next turn. From there, the sequence moves upward to (3,6) to avoid obstacles and body segments, positioning the snake to reach (5,6) by turn 74 (within the food's 9-turn life span). This path ensures all moves are safe, with cells becoming free as the tail moves away.\n> \n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 68: L\n> Turn 69: U\n> Turn 70: U\n> Turn 71: U\n> Turn 72: U\n> Turn 73: R\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion\n> \n> The main strategy prioritizes survival by avoiding the deadly move to (4,1) and instead moving left to safety, then ascending to clear space and approach the high-value food at (5,6) efficiently. This path leverages tail movement to free cells and minimizes risk by staying away from obstacles and body collisions, ensuring the snake can reach the food within its life span.\n",

It's turn 69. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), then segments: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> The snake has 17 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (3,2) from previous position. Since head is at (3,2) and direction is L, it came from (4,2), which matches the first body segment.\n> \n> Now, food: only one piece at (5,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Value 1 means positive food, since +1 is for positive food. Negative food would have -1, but here it's 1, so positive.\n> \n> Life span 9: it disappears after 9 turns, including this turn, so it has 9 turns left, meaning it will vanish after turn 77 (69 + 8, since countdown decreases each turn including current).\n> \n> Turn t1=69, food life span 9, so:\n> \n> - After turn 69, life span becomes 8\n> \n> - After turn 70, life span 7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 77, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 69 to 77 inclusive? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so:\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on turns when L >=1. After being eaten or when L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> At turn 69, life span is 9, so it can be eaten on turn 69 if head moves to (5,6).\n> \n> After turn 69, if not eaten, life span 8, and so on, down to turn 77: after turn 77, it would be life span 0 and disappear, so last chance to eat is turn 77.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 74 or so.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions starting from turn 69.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,2), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, or D.

But walls: (2,2) is not a wall, I think. Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,2) is within bounds, no internal obstacle at (2,2), internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (2,2) is empty.\n> \n> But when snake moves, the tail moves, so after move, the cell that was tail might be free, but for head movement, we need to check if the cell is occupied by body at the time of move.\n> \n> In this case, before move, (2,2) is not occupied by any body segment, so moving to (2,2) should be safe, as long as no wall.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (3,3): (3,3) is in snake positions? Let's see: positions include (4,3), (5,3), etc., but (3,3) is not listed. Snake has (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), but not (3,3). Positions: from head: (3,2), then (4,2), etc., no (3,3). So (3,3) is empty? But let's confirm: the list is (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). So (3,3) is not there, and not a wall. Internal obstacles don't include (3,3), so it should be free.\n> \n> But (3,3) might be a food? Food is only at (5,6), so no.\n> \n> So both (2,2) and (3,3) are possible moves.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (5,6). It's positive, value 1, so eating it would increase length by 1 and score by 1. But I need to get to (5,6) safely.\n> \n> Current head at (3,2), food at (5,6). That's not adjacent; I need to move multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with the tail. Tail is at (3,4), I think. Snake positions: last is (3,4), which is the tail.\n> \n> When snake moves, if I move to a cell, and if that cell was the tail, it's ok because tail moves away. But for body collision, head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, which is fine if head moves to tail position as tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, for immediate move, both (2,2) and (3,3) are not body segments, so safe.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence to maximize score, so probably I should try to eat the food if possible.\n> \n> (5,6) is the only food, and it's positive, so it's good to eat it before life span ends.\n> \n> Life span 9 turns, so I have time, but need to get there.\n> \n> But also, the grid has obstacles, and snake body, so I need a path.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I should draw a mental map.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal walls at: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: let's list positions by coordinate to see occupied cells.\n> \n> Head: (3,2)\n> \n> Body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> So snake occupies: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> Now, free cells: for example, (0,0) to (7,7) minus walls minus snake.\n> \n> But walls include borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the grid is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? No.\n> \n> The walls are cells, so for example, cell (0,0) is wall, (0,1) wall, ..., (0,7) wall, similarly (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (1,0) to (6,0) wall, (1,7) to (6,7) wall. And internal walls at specific points.\n> \n> In the input: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" – so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Then internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) is an internal obstacle, but (1,1) has x=1,y=1, not border, but it's an additional wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) etc.\n> \n> So wall cells: all with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, plus (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Now, playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except the internal wall cells.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) is wall, so not playable.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - L to (2,2): (2,2) is not wall, not snake, so ok.\n> \n> - U to (3,3): (3,3) is not wall, not snake, so ok.\n> \n> D to (3,1) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (4,2) is body, but (4,2) is the first body segment. If I move right, to (4,2), which is occupied by body, so collision, deadly. But since direction is L, I cannot move R anyway, instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only L or U.\n> \n> Now, I need to get to (5,6). From (3,2) to (5,6), which is +2 in x, +4 in y, so generally northeast.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> Also, snake body is around.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at (3,4). If I move towards the tail, I need to be careful about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.

Positions: after head at (3,4), the body includes (3,3), (3,2), etc., and the previous tail (3,4) is now head, so the segment that was at (3,5) becomes the new tail?

(3,5) to (3,6) would be up, but tail is (3,5), so from (3,6) to (3,5) is down.\n> \n> The positions are listed from head to tail, so the segment after head is the one that was head before, and so on.\n> \n> To find where the snake body is, I can plot the coordinates.\n> \n> Make a grid:\n> \n> y=6: row 6 (top, if y increases up)\n> \n> y=1: row 1 (bottom)\n> \n> x from left to right, 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) and (1,6) are on border? x=1,y=1 and x=1,y=6, but borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,1) is playable but obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly (1,6) is playable obstacle.\n> \n> Now snake:\n> \n> Head at (3,3)\n> \n> Then (3,2) - so (3,2) is occupied\n> \n> (4,2)\n> \n> (5,2)\n> \n> (5,1) - but (5,1) is occupied, and (3,1) is obstacle, but not same.\n> \n> (6,1)\n> \n> (6,2)\n> \n> (6,3)\n> \n> (5,3)\n> \n> (4,3) - (4,3) is occupied?

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 70, life span is 8, so it will last until turn 77? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so at turn t+L, it's gone. So available from t to t+L-1 inclusive? Example: at turn t, life span L, then on turn t, L decreases to L-1, on turn t+1, L-1 to L-2, ..., on turn t+(L-1), it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1.\n> \n> Here turn 70, food at (5,6) life span 8, so can be eaten on turns 70 to 77.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) life span 10, can be eaten on turns 70 to 79.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R (since D is reverse and not allowed)\n> \n> U: (3,4) - what is there?

Now, is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: look at list, (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), etc., (3,4) not in list, so free? Let's see: (4,4) is occupied, but (3,4) not listed. So (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, L: left, (x-1,y) so (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3): not border, not obstacle (obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not), not in snake positions?

Snake has (3,5) as tail? Tail is (3,5), but when snake moves, tail moves, so if head moves to (3,4), then the tail (3,5) might be free after move, depending on the move.\n> \n> This is important.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail end is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new position, and tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, tail not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if we move to a cell with food, we eat it and grow.\n> \n> Otherwise, just move.\n> \n> Now, current turn, if we move U to (3,4), what is there? No food, so no eat, head moves to (3,4), tail (3,5) is removed? Tail is (3,5), but let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: after move, head was at (3,3), moves to (3,4), then the body segments follow: the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (3,3), and so on, down to tail.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (3,3), 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (5,2), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,4), 11: (5,4), 12: (5,5), 13: (4,5), 14: (4,6), 15: (3,6), 16: (3,5)  // tail\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4), the new positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> \n> Then body: the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,3), then next to where the first was, (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), and tail (3,5) is removed, so snake has 16 segments now? Original 17 positions, after move no food, so length same, but tail removed, so positions from index 1 to 16 become new body, with head at (3,4), and tail was (3,5) removed, so the last position is now (3,6) which was index 15.\n> \n> New positions: head at (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)  // and (3,5) is gone.\n> \n> (3,6) is the new tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move L to (2,3), head at (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), etc., down to (3,6), tail (3,5) removed.\n> \n> Now back to decision.\n> \n> First, option: move U to (3,4)\n> \n> Then from there, position (3,4), direction U (since moved up).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R (cannot D)\n> \n> U: (3,5) — what is (3,5)? In new positions, after move, (3,5) is not occupied, because tail was removed. In the new positions, cells are: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), ..., (3,6) is tail. (3,5) is not in the list; it was removed. So (3,5) is free?

It's turn 71, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So yes, cells like (0,y) for any y, (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)]\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6). Let me list these to understand the snake shape.\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> \n> Body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)\n> \n> That's 17 segments.

Value 1 for both.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,6) it's 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 71, life span 7, so it disappears after turn 77? Let's see: at turn t, life span N, it will be gone after N-1 more turns? I need to be careful.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at current turn, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 next turn, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.

But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now it's gone.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if countdown starts at N on turn t, on turn t it is N, on turn t+1 it is N-1, ..., on turn t + N - 1 it is 1, on turn t + N it is 0 and disappears.

Borders are lines, but obstacles are cells. Border cells are walls, so (1,1) is a cell? The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,0), (0,1), etc. are walls, but playable area is (1,1) to (6,6), so (1,1) is a playable cell, but it has an internal obstacle? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: - Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. - Internal Obstacles: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)]\"\n> \n> It says \"internal obstacles\", and (1,1) is listed, but (1,1) is a corner of playable area? Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, so (1,1) is a playable cell, but it has an obstacle, meaning it's a wall cell. Similarly, (1,6) is playable but obstacle.\n> \n> Also, border cells like (1,0) would be wall, but since y=0 is wall, (1,0) is not playable.\n> \n> For movement, we can only move to cells that are not walls and not occupied by obstacles.\n> \n> So, let's list all wall cells:\n> \n> - All cells with x=0 or x=7 for any y\n> \n> - All cells with y=0 or y=7 for any x\n> \n> Plus internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Now (1,1) and (1,6) are listed as internal obstacles, but they are also on the border? x=1 is not border wall, border is x=0 and x=7. Similarly, y=1 and y=6 are not border, border is y=0 and y=7. So (1,1) is a playable cell with an obstacle, so it's a wall. Similarly for others.\n> \n> So effectively, wall cells are:\n> \n> - All (x,y) with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7\n> \n> - Plus (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> But (1,1) is already covered if we consider the borders, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, x=1 is not border, so (1,1) is not a border wall, but has internal obstacle.

Previous 16 (3,6) is removed. So new positions are from new index 0 to 16, but new index 16 is previous 15 (4,6), and previous 16 gone. So still 17 segments? But no food eaten, so length should decrease by one? Mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail end is vacated. So the snake shortens by one cell temporarily, but since no growth, the new snake has the same number of segments? No.\n> \n> Initial snake length L, after move without food, new length is L, but the tail position is left, so the snake occupies L cells, but the head is new, tail is removed, so it has L cells.\n> \n> For example, snake of length 1: head at A, move to B, now head at B, no body, so length 1.\n> \n> Length 2: head at A, body at B. Move head to C, then body moves to A, so now head at C, body at A, length 2.\n> \n> Similarly, for length L, after move without food, new head position, and body from position 1 to L-1 move to positions 0 to L-2, so the last position L-1 is vacated, and the new snake has segments at new positions with the same length L.\n> \n> But in terms of cells occupied, it moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, snake had 17 segments, after move, still 17 segments, but the tail cell is different.\n> \n> In my earlier, after move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) — that's 16 cells? Head and 15 bodies, so 16 segments. Let's count the list: 1. (3,5) head, 2. (3,4), 3. (3,3), 4. (3,2), 5. (4,2), 6. (5,2), 7. (5,1), 8. (6,1), 9. (6,2), 10. (6,3), 11. (5,3), 12. (4,3), 13. (4,4), 14. (5,4), 15. (5,5), 16. (4,5), 17. (4,6)? I missed one.\n> \n> Previous positions had 17: indices 0 to 16.\n> \n> After move: new head at (3,5)\n> \n> New position 1: previous position 0 (3,4)\n> \n> New position 2: previous position 1 (3,3)\n> \n> New position 3: previous position 2 (3,2)\n> \n> New position 4: previous position 3 (4,2)\n> \n> New position 5: previous position 4 (5,2)\n> \n> New position 6: previous position 5 (5,1)\n> \n> New position 7: previous position 6 (6,1)\n> \n> New position 8: previous position 7 (6,2)\n> \n> New position 9: previous position 8 (6,3)\n> \n> New position 10: previous position 9 (5,3)\n> \n> New position 11: previous position 10 (4,3)\n> \n> New position 12: previous position 11 (4,4)\n> \n> New position 13: previous position 12 (5,4)\n> \n> New position 14: previous position 13 (5,5)\n> \n> New position 15: previous position 14 (4,5)\n> \n> New position 16: previous position 15 (4,6)\n> \n> Previous position 16 (3,6) is gone, not occupied. So new snake has positions from new index 0 to 16, but new index 0: (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,1), 7: (6,1), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (4,3), 12: (4,4), 13: (5,4), 14: (5,5), 15: (4,5), 16: (4,6)\n> \n> That's 17 positions. new index 16 is (4,6), which was previous 15.

That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up (U), meaning it's moving upwards, so from (3,5) to... wait, it's at (3,5) moving U, which would be to (3,6), but let's see the food and possible moves.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 1 and life span 6. So it disappears after 6 turns, including this one, so by turn 78.\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1 and life span 8, so disappears by turn 80.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So can't go to those cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake body: positions as given. Head at (3,5), tail at (4,6)?

Let's see: positions are from (3,5) down to (4,6). (3,6) is not in the list, so it might be free.\n> \n> Food is at (5,6) and (1,4).\n> \n> (5,6) is one cell away from head? Head at (3,5), (5,6) is two cells away: Δx=2, Δy=1, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is at x=1,y=4, head at x=3,y=5, so Δx=2, Δy=1, not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (3,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4) but (3,4) is the second segment, so if I move down, head goes to (3,4) which is occupied by body, but is it safe? Rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (3,4) is not the tail; tail is at (4,6). (3,4) is the second segment, so moving to (3,4) would cause collision because the body segment is still there when head moves in, unless it's the tail.\n> \n> The rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But (3,4) is not the tail; it's a body segment. So moving to (3,4) would kill the snake because it's colliding with its own body.\n> \n> Similarly, left (L): to (2,5)\n> \n> Right (R): to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, what about (4,5)? It's in the snake positions: index 15 is (4,5), which is the second last segment? Positions: 14: (5,5), 15: (4,5), 16: (4,6) tail.\n> \n> So (4,5) is occupied, but it's not the tail; tail is (4,6). (4,5) is segment 15, which is part of the body. So moving to (4,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is segment 1, body.\n> \n> Now, is (2,5) free?

Snake has (3,5), (3,4), etc., no (2,5). Walls: x=0 border, but x=2>0, y=5 not border. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is different, not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,5) - occupied by snake body segment 15, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,6) - free\n> \n> - L: (2,5) - free\n> \n> D and R are not possible due to collision.\n> \n> Also, movement constraint: cannot reverse direction instantly. Head direction is U, so opposite is D, which is down. But D is not possible anyway since (3,4) is body. So only U and L are possible, and since reverse D is invalid, but it's not possible, so U and L are both valid moves.\n> \n> U is same direction, L is left, not opposite.\n> \n> Opposite of U is D, which is down, not L or R.\n> \n> So U and L are both allowed.\n> \n> Now, food: (5,6) and (1,4)\n> \n> (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, value 1, life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 78.\n> \n> (1,4) at x=1,y=4, value 1, life span 8, by turn 80.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U to (3,6).\n> \n> From (3,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But head would be at (3,6), direction U.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - U to (3,7): but y=7 is wall border, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D to (3,5): but (3,5) was head, now after move, tail moves, so (3,5) might be free or not?

Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,6), direction U. Moving up would go to (3,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. y=7 is the top border, so (3,7) is out of bounds? Borders are walls, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is wall collision.\n> \n> y=7 is y=7, which is border, so (3,7) is a wall cell. Similarly, (3,6) is at y=6, moving up to (3,7) which is wall, so cannot move up.\n> \n> Head direction is U, but from (3,6), moving up to (3,7) is invalid because y=7 is wall. So current possible moves: since direction is U, but we can't move up, we can move left or right? But there's no instant reverse, but since up is invalid, we can only move L or R.\n> \n> No instant reverse means we can't move directly opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, opposite is D. So we can move L or R, but not D, and not U because wall.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R. But U is invalid (wall), D is possible? D is down, to (3,5), but (3,5) is the body segment. Snake positions: (3,5) is the second segment, so head moving to (3,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> Let's list adjacent cells to head (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) - y=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) - occupied by body segment, collision if we move there\n> \n> - Left: (2,6) - is this free?\n> \n> - Right: (4,6) - is this free?\n> \n> Now, (2,6): let's see if it's occupied or wall.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (2,6) is within bounds, x=2,y=6. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (1,6) is a wall, but (2,6) is not listed, so should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: from (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), etc. down to (4,5). (2,6) is not in the list, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): not in snake positions, not a wall, so free.\n> \n> (3,5) is body, down direction.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) itself, but head is there, moving to same cell not possible.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) body, collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: (2,6) - seems free\n> \n> - R: (4,6) - seems free\n> \n> But direction is U, and we can move L or R since not opposite.

Snake positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), etc. (5,6) is not listed, so it's free, I think.\n> \n> (5,6): x=5,y=6. Snake: (5,5) is position 16, (5,4) is 15, (5,3) is 12, etc. No (5,6), so (5,6) is free and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4): x=1,y=4. Snake positions: (1,4) not listed.

Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then it disappears after that turn or at the end?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases on turn t, and at countdown=0, it disappears at the end of turn.\n> \n> But to be precise: \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now.\n> \n> Example: if life span N at turn t, then after turn t, countdown becomes N-1, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> So it is present for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn t + N or something.\n> \n> But for planning, we need to know when it expires.\n> \n> For (5,6): life span 5 at turn 73, so countdown 5. After turn 73, it becomes 4, then 3,2,1, and after turn 77, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 73 to 77, inclusive? Turn 73: countdown 5, eaten if head on it. Turn 74: countdown 4, etc., up to turn 77: countdown 1, eaten if head on it.

This maximizes the score while avoiding immediate risks. \n\nHere's the immediate action for Turn 74:\n\n\\boxed{R} \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Food Priority**: The food at (5,6) has a short lifespan (4 turns) and will disappear soon. Eating it now ensures we don't miss the opportunity.\n2. **Safety**: Moving right to (5,6) is safe because:\n   - (5,6) is not occupied by the snake's body or walls.\n   - The tail is at (5,5), which is diagonally adjacent to the head (not directly adjacent), so no tail reward danger exists.\n3. **No Better Option**: \n   - Moving down (D) to (4,5) avoids the food but doesn't provide any immediate benefit and may lead to dead ends later.\n   - Moving left (L) is invalid (opposite of current direction R).\n   - Moving up (U) is invalid (hits the wall at y=7).\n\n### Long-Term Consideration:\nWhile this move may lead to challenges in future turns (e.g., potential dead ends), it is the optimal choice for Turn 74 to secure the +1 reward and avoid losing the food. Subsequent moves can be planned to navigate the snake away from traps. \n\n### Next Steps (for future turns):\nAfter eating the food at (5,6), the snake will grow, and the next move could be:\n- Down (D) to (5,5) to avoid the corner, or \n- Right (R) to (6,6) if space allows, though this risks trapping the snake later. \n\nHowever, as a non-thinking executor, only the immediate action for Turn 74 is required: \\boxed{R}.",

It's turn 75. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,6), and it's moving right (R). The body segments follow: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). That's 18 segments, so the snake is long.\n> \n> Food: two items listed as (1,4,5,1) and (4,4,8,1). I think the format is (x, y, life_span, value). For (1,4,5,1), that means position (1,4), life span 5, value +1 (since it's positive food). Similarly, (4,4,8,1) is (4,4), life span 8, value +1.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1, so eating them increases length by 1. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,4), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including the current turn. So at turn 75, life span is 5, so it will disappear after turn 79? Let's clarify the countdown.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. If life span is 5 at turn 75, that means:\n> \n> - Turn 75: life span 5\n> \n> - Turn 76: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 77: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 78: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 79: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 80: life span 0, disappears after this turn? Or before?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn 75, life span is 5. After the turn, it decreases to 4 for the next state. But for eating, it's during the turn.\n> \n> Typically, the food is present during the turn if life span > 0 at the start of the turn. When the head moves to the food cell during the turn, it is eaten, and then the food disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at the beginning of turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns. So for (1,4), life span 5 at turn 75, it will be present until turn 79, and disappear after turn 79 or before turn 80? Let's define turns clearly.\n> \n> Assume that the countdown is for the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So with life span L, it is available for L turns starting from the current turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L: it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., up to turn t+L-1? Or turn t+L?\n> \n> \"disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now, it disappears.\n> \n> And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t, countdown is N, then after turn t, countdown is N-1 for turn t+1.\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, if life span is N, it is present during turn t. After turn t, life span becomes N-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> If life span is 1 at turn t, it is present during turn t, and after turn t, it disappears, so not present for turn t+1.\n> \n> For (1,4): at turn 75, life span 5, so it will be present for turns 75,76,77,78,79. After turn 79, it disappears, so not on turn 80.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 8, so present for turns 75 to 82.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,6), direction R, so moving right to (6,6)? But (6,6) might be a wall or not.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=7 is a wall, so (6,6) is not a wall cell? x from 0 to 7, so x=7 is wall, meaning cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n> \n> So (6,6) is not a wall; x=6,y=6, x=6<7, y=6<7, and not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles are given, so (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> But snake body: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collision.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n> \n> Head is (5,6), moving right to (6,6). Is (6,6) occupied? Let's see the positions: (5,6) is head, then (4,6), (3,6), etc. (6,6) is not in the list, so it should be free. Also, not a wall.\n> \n> But walls: internal (6,4) is a wall, but (6,6) is different.\n> \n> (6,4) is wall, (6,6) is not.\n> \n> So moving to (6,6) should be possible, but let's see what happens after that.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead for action sequence.\n> \n> First, possible actions from current position.\n> \n> Head at (5,6), direction R, so moving right to (6,6).\n> \n> But I can also change direction? Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). Since current direction is R, I cannot move left (L) on the next turn because of no instant reverse. So from (5,6), with dir R, possible moves: U, D, R. Cannot move L.\n> \n> Now, cells:\n> \n> - Right: (6,6) - is it free? From positions, (6,6) not occupied. Walls: not border, not internal obstacle (internal are (3,1),(2,4),(1,1),(1,6),(6,4)), so (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Up: (5,7) - but y=7 is border wall, so (5,7) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (5,5) - now, (5,5) is in snake positions? Positions list: ... (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — yes, (5,5) is the tail? Let's see the list: positions are in order, head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), ..., (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). (5,5) is the last segment? List has 18 positions: indices 0 to 17, head (5,6), body up to (5,5).\n> \n> (5,5) is the 17th segment, which is the tail, I think. Positions: [0:(5,6), 1:(4,6), 2:(3,6), 3:(3,5), 4:(3,4), 5:(3,3), 6:(3,2), 7:(4,2), 8:(5,2), 9:(5,1), 10:(6,1), 11:(6,2), 12:(6,3), 13:(5,3), 14:(4,3), 15:(4,4), 16:(5,4), 17:(5,5)]\n> \n> So tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, moving down to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by the tail. But rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So it's allowed, as long as after moving, the tail moves away and doesn't cause collision.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats and grows, so tail doesn't move that turn. Otherwise, tail moves forward.\n> \n> But here, (5,5) is the tail, and it has no food, I think. Food is at (1,4) and (4,4), not at (5,5).\n> \n> So if head moves to (5,5), which is the tail, since it's not food, the snake moves, head to (5,5), and tail moves from (5,5) to the next segment? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell has food, snake eats it, head occupies the cell, and a new segment is added at the end (tail grows), so length increases.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, so the tail segment is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, since the tail will move away (unless it grows), it should be safe, because after the move, the tail is no longer there.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,5) which is tail: since (5,5) is tail, and if head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied, but rule says it's allowed because tail moves.\n> \n> But only if it's not food. Here no food at (5,5), so it should be ok.\n> \n> If it were food, and tail, it could be dangerous due to tail reward danger.\n> \n> But here no food.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,6):\n> \n> - R: to (6,6) - free cell\n> \n> - D: to (5,5) - tail cell, but allowed since tail moves\n> \n> - U: to (5,7) - but y=7 wall, cannot\n> \n> - L: to (4,6) - but (4,6) is the first body segment, and since no instant reverse, but current direction R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed. Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" so from R, cannot move L.\n> \n> So only possible: R or D.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,4) and (4,4)\n> \n> (4,4) is occupied by the snake? Positions: (4,4) is in the list, index 15: (4,4). So it's under the body.\n> \n> But food at (4,4) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> Since it's under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is not occupied? Positions: let's see, (1,4) not in list, so it should be free.\n> \n> (1,4): x=1,y=4. Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (3,1),(2,4),(1,1),(1,6), so (1,4) not wall, so free.\n> \n> But (2,4) is wall, so (1,4) should be accessible.\n> \n> Now, life span: (1,4) life span 5 at turn 75, so present until turn 79.\n> \n> (4,4) life span 8, until turn 82.\n> \n> I need to think about getting to these foods.\n> \n> But (4,4) is currently occupied by snake body at (4,4), so to eat it, the snake must move so that (4,4) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, head at (5,6), which is far from (1,4) and (4,4) is under body.\n> \n> First, let's see the map.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7), but walls at borders and internals.\n> \n> Internal walls: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake is long, 18 segments.\n> \n> Head at (5,6), moving R or D.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,6), then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> But I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But tail is at (5,5), no food.\n> \n> Food at (4,4) and (1,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is under body, so if it becomes exposed, it might be eatable.\n> \n> First, let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (6,6) at turn 75.\n> \n> Then head at (6,6), direction now R? Or I can choose new direction, but after moving, the direction is set.\n> \n> After action, the head direction is updated to the move direction.\n> \n> So if I move R to (6,6), new head direction is R.\n> \n> Then from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7), but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (6,5); L to (5,6); R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, cannot. So only D or L.\n> \n> But no instant reverse, since new direction R, moving L is opposite, so cannot move L to (5,6) because it's opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction after move is R, so from (6,6), can move U, D, R. But U to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, so only D to (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is free?

Let me clarify.\n> \n> The life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will exist for L more turns, including turn t. After L turns, it disappears.

Let's see.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But internal obstacles are given, so some cells inside are also walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) and (1,6) are on the border? y=1 is not border, borders are y=0 and y=7. Similarly x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But (1,1): x=1, y=1, which is corner, but not border wall? Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,1) is a cell, but it's listed as internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is y=6, not y=7, so not border, but obstacle.\n> \n> So walls are:\n> \n> - All cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 (border)\n> \n> - Plus internal: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) is both? Border is x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) has x=1, y=1, not 0 or 7, so it's internal obstacle. Similarly for others.\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls at borders and these points.\n> \n> Now snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (6,5)\n> \n> Then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4)\n> \n> Food at (1,4), (4,4), (6,1)\n> \n> (4,4) has food, but (4,4) is also the tail position? Snake positions include (4,4) as the last segment, tail.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the snake's body, and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,4) is occupied by the tail, and there is food there. So if the tail moves away, and head moves to (4,4), it can be eaten.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what are possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (6,5), direction Down. So moving Down would go to (6,4), but (6,4) is a wall? Internal obstacle at (6,4), which is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, (6,4) is listed as internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move to (6,4).\n> \n> Possible directions: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly? Current direction is D, so cannot move U next? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so next move cannot be U (up).\n> \n> Also, cannot move into walls or body, except tail.\n> \n> First, let's find adjacent cells to head (6,5):\n> \n> - Up: (6,6) - but (6,6) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: head (6,5), then (6,6) is the next segment, so body part. Moving to (6,6) would collide with body, deadly.\n> \n> - Down: (6,4) - but (6,4) is a wall, internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left: (5,5) - is this free? Let's see what is at (5,5).\n> \n> Snake positions: from (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> (5,5) is not in the list, so not occupied by snake. Also, not a wall? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (5,5) x=5,y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles, so free.\n> \n> - Right: (7,5) - but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so (7,5) is invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: Left to (5,5) or... Up and Down are blocked, Right is wall. Only Left is possible? But Up is to (6,6) which is body, Down to (6,4) wall, Right to (7,5) wall, only Left to (5,5) seems free.\n> \n> But current direction is Down, and Left is perpendicular, so that should be allowed, no instant reverse issue.\n> \n> So from (6,5), only possible move is L to (5,5)? Is that right?\n> \n> Confirm: adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - occupied by snake body (second segment)\n> \n> - D: (6,4) - wall\n> \n> - L: (5,5) - not occupied, not wall\n> \n> - R: (7,5) - x=7, border wall\n> \n> Yes, only L to (5,5) is possible. No other choice.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Action for turn 77 must be L to (5,5).\n> \n> Then, after moving to (5,5), what is the new state?\n> \n> After moving, the snake moves: head to new position, tail moves forward if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten (assuming), head moves to (5,5), and tail moves from (4,4) to the next? When snake moves, if not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and tail segment is removed.\n> \n> Snake positions: current: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> After moving head to (5,5), the body segments: the first body segment (6,6) moves to the old head position (6,5)?

(5,5) to (4,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent are up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So from (5,5), (4,4) is not directly reachable; need to go through (4,5) or (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is far, (6,1) is at (6,1).\n> \n> Now, tail is at (4,3), and food at (4,4) is adjacent to tail? (4,4) is above (4,3), so if head moves to (4,4) while tail is at (4,3), that might be dangerous.\n> \n> Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake.\n> \n> In this case, tail at (4,3), food at (4,4), so if head moves to (4,4) to eat, at that moment, head and tail are adjacent? (4,4) and (4,3) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> So if head eats food at (4,4) while tail is at (4,3), then after eating, snake grows, so new tail is added, but since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so head is at (4,4), tail at (4,3), and they are adjacent, so if the head moves to (4,4), and eats, the snake length increases, so the new segment is added at head, and tail stays, so head and tail are adjacent, and if the head then moves, it might collide with tail, but immediately after eating, the head is at (4,4), tail at (4,3), and they are adjacent, so if the snake moves, depending on direction, it might go into tail.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, when eating the food, if head and tail are adjacent, and the food is on the tail cell, then eating it causes immediate collision because the new tail grows, but the head is right next to it, so after growth, head and the new tail segment are adjacent, and since the head moved there, it's like the head is next to the body, but the tail was just eaten, so the new tail is the old tail position? Let's think.\n> \n> When snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Thus, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So, if tail is at T, head moves to F (food on T), then after eating, head is at F (which was T), and a new segment is added at T, so the tail is now at T, but since F was T, it's the same cell? No.\n> \n> Case: food is on the tail cell. Tail is at cell T with food. Head moves to T to eat.\n> \n> After move, head is now at T, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which is T, so now there is a segment at T (the new head) and a new segment at T? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake eating: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows. So the head moves to the food cell, and instead of removing the tail, the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Positions: suppose tail is at S, head moves to T where food is on T. After eating, new head at T, and the tail remains at S, but a new segment is added at the end, so the tail is still S, but the segment that was tail is now the second last, and the new tail is... no.\n> \n> Typically, when eating, head moves to food cell, and no tail is removed that turn, so the new positions are: [new head] + all old positions.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> Head at H, tail at T.\n> \n> Head moves to F (food).\n> \n> If F has food, after move, positions: [F, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so length increased by one, new tail is T.\n> \n> If no food, positions: [F, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where Bk was the second last, so tail removed.\n> \n> In this case, if food is on tail cell T, head moves to T.\n> \n> Before move: tail at T with food.\n> \n> After move and eat: new positions [T, H, B1, B2, ..., T_prev] but T_prev was the position before tail? Positions: let's index.\n> \n> Suppose positions: index 0: H, index 1: B1, ..., index n-1: T (tail)\n> \n> Head moves to F.\n> \n> If F has food, new positions: index 0: F (new head), index 1: H (old head), index 2: B1, ..., index n: T (old tail) so new tail is T, length n+1.\n> \n> If F is the tail cell, that is, F = T, then head moves to T, which has food, so new positions: [T, H, B1, B2, ..., T] but T is the same cell, so positions [T, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-2}, T] but the last T is the old tail position, which is same as new head, so collision immediately.\n> \n> Yes, so if head moves directly to the tail cell to eat food, it causes collision because the head and the new segment are at the same position or adjacent in a way that causes issue.\n> \n> The rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" In this case, after eating, the head is at T, and the new tail is at T, but that can't be; it's the same cell.\n> \n> In the new positions, the head is at T, and the first body segment is at H, and the last segment is at the old tail position T, so head at T and last segment at T, which is impossible; it must be that the cell is duplicated.\n> \n> So practically, moving head to the tail cell to eat food when it's the only cell causes instant death because the snake would have two segments at the same position.\n> \n> But in this case, for (4,4), tail was at (4,4), but after the move on turn 77, tail moved to (4,3), so (4,4) is now free with food, and tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,4) from (5,5), it's not directly to tail cell; tail is at (4,3), different cell.\n> \n> But they are adjacent: (4,4) and (4,3) are adjacent.\n> \n> Now, if head moves to (4,4) to eat food, at that moment, head and tail are at (4,4) and (4,3), which are adjacent.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows: new head at (4,4), new body: old head (5,5) becomes first body segment, and so on, up to old tail at (4,3), and since food eaten, no tail removed, so the old tail remains, and a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> Before move to (4,4): positions at turn 78 before move: head at (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), ..., tail at (4,3)\n> \n> Head moves to (4,4) which has food.\n> \n> After move and eat: new head at (4,4), then old head (5,5) as first body segment, then the rest: (6,5), (6,6), ..., up to old tail (4,3), and since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the old tail (4,3) is still there, and the new tail is (4,3)?

I should note these as walls that the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: the head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow. The snake is 18 segments long, based on the list: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)].

Then the body follows: the first body segment moves to previous head (5,5), so positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (4,3) is removed? Since no food eaten, tail moves off.\n> \n> When no food, tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one at the tail.\n> \n> After move: new positions: head at (4,5), then segments: old head (5,5) becomes first body, so body: (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and the old tail (4,3) is removed, so the new tail is (5,3)?

On turn 79, after eating at (4,4), we are at (4,4), and (1,4) is at distance 3, but it must be eaten by turn 79 or it disappears. Since we are on turn 79, and we just moved to (4,4), we can eat (1,4) only if we move to it, but it's not adjacent; we are at (4,4), (1,4) is 3 left, not adjacent, so we cannot eat it this turn. On turn 79, after moving to (4,4), the food at (1,4) has life span: after turn 78, it had life span 1 (since started with 2 on turn 78, decreased after turn 78 to 1), then after turn 79, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 79 or before, but on turn 79, we are at (4,4), not at (1,4), so we miss it. It disappears after turn 79.\n> \n> Therefore, we cannot eat (1,4) because it's too far and we have to go to (4,4) first, which takes two turns, and by then it's gone.\n> \n> If on turn 78 we go down to (5,4) instead.\n> \n> Move to (5,4) on turn 78.\n> \n> From (5,5) down to (5,4).\n> \n> New head at (5,4), direction D.\n> \n> New positions: head (5,4), then old head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail, old (4,3) removed.\n> \n> Then on turn 79, from (5,4), we move left to (4,4) to eat the food, same as before.\n> \n> End up at (4,4) on turn 79, and (1,4) not eaten, disappears.\n> \n> So (1,4) cannot be eaten; we should ignore it since it's impossible to reach in time.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (6,1) with life span 8, under the body.\n> \n> Currently, (6,1) is occupied by a body segment.

No, the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those cells are walls and can't be moved to. Similarly, internal obstacles are walls.\n> \n> So, the playable area is inside, but with obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - All x=0 for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All x=7 for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All y=0 for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All y=7 for x=0 to 7\n> \n> Plus internal: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Now, food: (1,4), (4,4), (6,1), (6,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (4,5)  // turn 79, head moving left\n> \n> Then: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n> \n> (6,1) and (6,2) have food, but the snake body is on (6,1) and (6,2)? Let's see: positions include (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n> \n> (6,1) is a snake body segment, and there's food at (6,1) with life span 7. But food can spawn under the body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) has food and snake body.\n> \n> But for (6,1), the body is on it now, so to eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body leaves (6,1), and later head comes back when it's free.\n> \n> But life span: (6,1) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Turn is 79. Food at (1,4) life span 1, so after this turn, it might disappear if not eaten? Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 79, life span is 1, meaning after turn 79, it will be gone? Let me read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the turn it spawns, life span N, countdown N. Each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, if life span is N, after turn t, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But when is it eaten? When the head moves onto it during a turn.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 79:\n> \n> - Food at (1,4): life span 1, so countdown=1. After turn 79, it disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 79 if head moves there.\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life span 4, countdown=4, so available until turn 79+3=82? Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> At start of turn 79, life span for (1,4) is 1, so if not eaten this turn, after this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 4, so countdown=4 at turn 79. After turn 79, countdown=3; after turn 80, countdown=2; after turn 81, countdown=1; after turn 82, countdown=0, gone. So it can be eaten on turns 79,80,81,82.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 7, countdown=7, available until turn 79+6=85? After turn 85, countdown=0.\n> \n> Turn 79: countdown=7\n> \n> After turn 79: countdown=6\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 85: countdown=0, gone. So last chance to eat is turn 85.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 10, countdown=10, available until turn 88.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,5), moving left (L), so from (4,5), moving left would go to (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) is a snake body segment? Snake positions: (4,5) head, then (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), ... so (3,5) is the 8th segment? Let's index:\n> \n> Index 0: (4,5) head\n> \n> 1: (5,5)\n> \n> 2: (6,5)\n> \n> 3: (6,6)\n> \n> 4: (5,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (3,6)\n> \n> 7: (3,5)  // this is the segment directly left of head\n> \n> 8: (3,4)\n> \n> 9: (3,3)\n> \n> 10: (3,2)\n> \n> 11: (4,2)\n> \n> 12: (5,2)\n> \n> 13: (5,1)\n> \n> 14: (6,1)\n> \n> 15: (6,2)\n> \n> 16: (6,3)\n> \n> 17: (5,3)  // tail\n> \n> Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Head at (4,5), moving left to (3,5). But (3,5) is occupied by body segment at index 7. However, in snake movement, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and if it's not food, the tail moves away, so the cell is freed. But if head moves to a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell occupied by the body, it dies, except if it's the tail and no food is eaten, because the tail moves, so it's safe. But if you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail position, it would collide with the new tail.\n> \n> From rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> And for food: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head at (4,5), tail at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (4,5) and (5,3) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (4,5) to (5,3): delta x=1, delta y=-2, not adjacent. Adjacent would be (4,5) to (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> If head moves left to (3,5), which is occupied by body, it would collide and die, because it's not the tail.\n> \n> Is that right? (3,5) is index 7, which is body, not tail. Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) would cause collision with body, game over.\n> \n> But current head direction is L, meaning it was moving left, but on this turn, I can choose a different direction, since I control the action each turn.\n> \n> The head direction is given as \"L\", which is the current direction it's facing, but I can change direction, except no instant reverse.\n> \n> From rules: \"In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U, D, L, R\"\n> \n> And \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - Left (L) to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied by snake body, so collision, death.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (4,6): (4,6) is occupied? Snake positions: (4,6) is index 5, body segment. So moving to (4,6) would also collide.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (4,4): what is at (4,4)? There is food at (4,4), but is it occupied? Snake positions: let's see, (4,5) head, then (5,5), (6,5), etc., no (4,4) in positions. Food at (4,4), so (4,4) is free? But walls or obstacles?\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (4,4) not listed as wall, and not border since x=4, y=4 between 0-7, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it free for movement? Snake body not there, food is there, but food doesn't block; you can move to food to eat it.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (5,5): (5,5) is index 1, body segment, so moving there would collide.\n> \n> So, from (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left: to (3,5) - occupied by body, death\n> \n> - Up: to (4,6) - occupied by body (index 5), death\n> \n> - Down: to (4,4) - has food, and not occupied by body?

Tail is seg18 (5,3), seg17 (6,3), seg16 (6,2), seg15 (6,1), so seg15 is 3 steps from tail: from tail seg18, to seg17, seg16, seg15.\n> \n> Index from tail: tail is index 18, seg15 is index 15, so 18-15=3 steps from tail.\n> \n> To free the cell (6,1), the segment on it needs to move away, which happens when the tail advances. After 3 moves without eating, the tail will have moved, and the segment that was on (6,1) will be the new tail or something.\n> \n> After m moves without eating, the tail moves m times, so the first m segments from tail are removed, and the body advances.\n> \n> After m moves no eat, the new tail is the segment that was at index 18-m.\n> \n> For (6,1) occupied by seg15, after k moves, if no eat, seg15 will be at index 15-k, and when 15-k <= 0, it might be gone, but indices shift.\n> \n> After k moves no eat, the segment that was at position i will be at position i-k if i-k >=0, else removed.\n> \n> For example, at turn 80, seg15 at (6,1).\n> \n> After 1 move no eat, new positions: seg15 is no longer, because indices shift; the old seg15 becomes new seg14 or something.\n> \n> After one move no eat: new seg0 to new seg17, with new seg0 = new head position, new seg1 = old seg0, ..., new seg17 = old seg17, old seg18 removed.\n> \n> So the cell that was old seg15 (6,1) is now occupied by new seg14, which is old seg14, not old seg15. old seg15 is now new seg14? Let's see:\n> \n> New seg0: new head\n> \n> New seg1: old seg0\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New seg15: old seg14  // because new seg15 = old seg14\n> \n> New seg16: old seg15\n> \n> New seg17: old seg16\n> \n> New seg18: old seg17  // and old seg18 removed.\n> \n> In this case, for old seg15 at (6,1), after one move no eat, it becomes new seg16 at old position? No:\n> \n> After move, new seg16 = old seg15, so old seg15 is now at the position of new seg16, but new seg16 is at the same position as old seg15 before move, because the segments don't move to new cells except the head.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for body segments, each one moves to the position of the segment that was closer to the head.\n> \n> Specifically, for the cell (6,1), it is occupied by seg15. When head moves, seg15 will move to where seg14 was, which is (5,1), so (6,1) is no longer occupied by that segment; instead, seg15 moves to (5,1), and (6,1) is now occupied by seg16, which moves to (6,1) from (6,2)? Let's take the positions.\n> \n> Before move: seg14: (5,1), seg15: (6,1), seg16: (6,2), seg17: (6,3), seg18: (5,3)\n> \n> After head moves to (4,3), no eat:\n> \n> New seg0: (4,3)  // new head\n> \n> New seg1: old seg0 (4,4)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (4,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New seg14: old seg13 (5,2)  // old seg13 was (5,2)\n> \n> New seg15: old seg14 (5,1)  // seg15 moves to (5,1)\n> \n> New seg16: old seg15 (6,1)  // seg16 moves to (6,1)\n> \n> New seg17: old seg16 (6,2)  // seg17 moves to (6,2)\n> \n> New seg18: old seg17 (6,3)  // tail\n> \n> So (6,1) is now occupied by new seg16, which is old seg15, so still occupied, by the same segment? No, new seg16 is at (6,1), but it is old seg15, so the segment that was on (6,1) is now on (5,1) as new seg15, and (6,1) is now occupied by new seg16 which was old seg16 on (6,2), but old seg16 was on (6,2), not on (6,1).\n> \n> Before move, (6,1) has seg15.\n> \n> After move, seg15 has moved to (5,1), and (6,1) has new seg16 which is old seg16 from (6,2), so (6,1) is now occupied by a different segment, the one that was on (6,2).\n> \n> So the cell (6,1) is still occupied, but by a different body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, for the food to be accessible, the cell needs to be empty, which only happens when no body segment is on it.\n> \n> For (6,1), it will be empty when the segment that is on it moves away and no other segment moves to it, which means that the body has moved past that point or the tail has left it.\n> \n> In this case, since the snake is coiled, it might take many turns for (6,1) to be free.\n> \n> Specifically, (6,1) is currently occupied, and it will remain occupied until the tail passes through it or the snake moves away from the area.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,3), and to move to (6,1), it needs to go through (6,2) or (6,3), but (6,2) and (6,3) are also occupied.\n> \n> The area around (6,1) is dense with body segments.\n> \n> To free (6,1), the snake needs to move so that the body unwinds from that area.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2).\n> \n> Life span of (6,1) is 7 at turn 79, so after turn 79, countdown 6, so it has 6 more turns, from turn 80 to 85, to be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) has countdown 9 after turn 79, so 9 more turns.\n> \n> But it might not be possible to eat them soon due to the body on them.\n> \n> For now, at turn 80, I need to move from (4,4) to either (4,3) or (5,4).\n> \n> Let's see the grid around.\n> \n> First, move to (4,3): south, to (4,3)\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> Or move to (5,4): east, to (5,4)\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Let's list free cells or possible paths.\n> \n> The snake is taking up a lot of space in the bottom-right and left.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), which is center.\n> \n> Free cells: let's list all playable cells.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles: (1,1), (2,4), (3,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> So obstacles at: (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> Also, border walls, so cells like (1,2) to (1,5) are playable, etc.\n> \n> But snake occupies 19 cells, so free cells are total playable minus snake minus obstacles.\n> \n> Total playable cells: 6x6 = 36 minus 5 obstacles = 31.\n> \n> Snake: 19 cells occupied.\n> \n> Food at (6,1) and (6,2) are occupied by snake, so not free, but they have food, so when free, they are food cells.\n> \n> For free cells, we exclude the occupied cells.\n> \n> At turn 80 start, occupied cells: the 19 snake positions.\n> \n> Free cells: 31 - 19 = 12 cells, but some may have food that is under body, but since occupied, not accessible yet.\n> \n> The free cells are the ones not occupied and not wall.\n> \n> List all playable cells:\n> \n> For x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles: (1,1), (1,6), (2,4), (3,1), (6,4)\n> \n> So possible cells:\n> \n> y=1: x=1,2,4,5,6 but (1,1) obstacle, (3,1) obstacle, so x=2,4,5,6 for y=1? x=1,2,3,4,5,6 for y=1, but (1,1) and (3,1) obstacles, so only (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) but (6,1) occupied by snake, (5,1) occupied, so free: (2,1), (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied?

Long-term survival was limited by the body-occupied grid and lack of safe paths to open areas.\n",

longer life span (disappears after turn 88) compared to (6,1) (disappears after turn 86), while avoiding immediate collisions; however, after eating, the snake risks entrapment due to the crowded environment and the remaining food under the tail. Long-term survival is compromised, but this maximizes the immediate score gain given the constraints.\n",

Then seg2 moves to old seg1 position, which was (4,3), but (4,3) is now head, so it can't move there; I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail is removed, and a new head is added.\n> \n> So from current state:\n> \n> Positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), ..., (6,2) ] 19 segments.\n> \n> If I move head to (4,3), which is currently occupied by seg1.\n> \n> But (4,3) has food. If I move there, I eat the food, so the tail is not removed; the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So after move:\n> \n> - New head at (4,3)\n> \n> - The body segments: the first body segment is at old head (5,3)\n> \n> - Then next at old seg1 position, but since food was eaten, we add a new segment at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added at the head, so length increases.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows: the head moves to the food cell, and the body remains, so the new position has head at food cell, and the previous head position is now a body segment, and the tail does not move, so the snake is longer.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,3):\n> \n> - (4,3) has food, so we eat it.\n> \n> - New snake positions: head at (4,3), then old head (5,3) as seg1, then old seg1 (which was at (4,3), but that cell is now head, so the segment that was there is not moved; instead, since we ate food, we keep the body as is and add the new head position.\n> \n> Positions after move:\n> \n> - New head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Then the existing body segments: but the first body segment was at (4,3), which is now head, so we don't include that position again. The body segments start from the old positions except the tail might stay.\n> \n> Standard: after eating food, the snake has head at new position, then the entire previous body, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, previous positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to a cell with food: new positions [new H, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so new head, old head, then body, tail stays.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,3) which is B1's position.\n> \n> Previous: H at (5,3), B1 at (4,3), B2 at (4,4), etc.\n> \n> Move head to (4,3): since (4,3) has food, we eat it, so new positions: head at (4,3), then old head (5,3) as new B1, then old B1 (4,3) as new B2? But (4,3) is now head, so we can't have B2 at same position.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Correct way: when the head moves to a new cell, if it eats food, the tail does not move, so the new snake is [new head position] + [all previous positions from head to tail].\n> \n> So previous positions: P0 = head (5,3), P1 = (4,3), P2 = (4,4), ..., P18 = (6,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,3): new head at (4,3), and since we eat food at (4,3), we keep the body, so new positions: [ (4,3) ] + [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), ..., (6,2) ] but (4,3) is duplicated.\n> \n> That can't be.\n> \n> The list should be: new head at the new position, then the previous head position, then the previous body positions except the tail is not removed.\n> \n> So new positions: new_head = (4,3), then previous P0 = (5,3), then P1 = (4,3), but P1 is (4,3) which is same as new_head, so collision.\n> \n> This is a problem because the body segment at P1 is still at (4,3) when we move the head there.\n> \n> According to the rules, food under body can be eaten only if the body moves away first. In this case, if I move to (4,3), the body at (4,3) will not have moved away; it's still there, but when the head moves in, it might cause collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), the body is at (4,3), so if I move head to (4,3), the body hasn't moved away; it's still there until after the move, but during the move, it might be occupied.\n> \n> I think for the head to move to a cell that has both food and body, it's dangerous.\n> \n> Specifically, rule says: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" only if adjacent to tail and tail has food, but for body, it's general collision.\n> \n> Let's read the collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by a body segment other than the tail is deadly collision.\n> \n> Only if moving to the tail cell, it's safe because the tail moves.\n> \n> For (4,3), it is a body segment (not tail), so moving to (4,3) would cause collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly for other food under body.\n> \n> So, for food at (4,3), I cannot eat it now because it's under a body segment, and I can't move there without colliding.\n> \n> I need to wait for the body to move away.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,1) and (6,2), but (6,2) is tail, so moving to (6,2) might be possible.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current position (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since head direction is R, it cannot move L (left), because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible: U (up, to (5,4)), D (down, to (5,2)), R (right, to (6,3)).\n> \n> L is invalid because instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, check each cell:\n> \n> - U to (5,4): what is at (5,4)? From snake positions, (5,4) is not listed, so it should be empty. Snake has (5,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), etc., no (5,4). (4,4) is there, but (5,4) is free? Let's list all snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So (5,4) is not occupied, so it should be free.\n> \n> Also, walls: (5,4) is not a wall, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, internal obstacles (3,1),(2,4),(1,1),(1,6),(6,4), so (5,4) is not wall. So (5,4) is empty and safe to move.\n> \n> - D to (5,2): (5,2) is a body segment, position 14: (4,2), (5,2) is position 15? Positions: 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (5,2), 16: (5,1), etc. So (5,2) is occupied by segment 15, not tail. Tail is at (6,2), segment 18.\n> \n> So (5,2) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision, deadly. Cannot move D.\n> \n> - R to (6,3): (6,3) what is there? Snake positions: no (6,3), so empty. Walls: x=6,y=3, not border or internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (6,4), but (6,3) is different. Borders x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border, y=3 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is one, but (6,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> (6,4) is wall, so (6,3) is adjacent but not wall. So (6,3) should be safe.\n> \n> Also, food? No food at (6,3), so just empty cell.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (5,4) or R to (6,3). D is invalid because collision, L is invalid because instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food to consider.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food situation.\n> \n> Food at (6,1): under body segment 17, life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 86 (since current turn 82, life span 5: after 5 turns, on turn 87 it should be gone, but let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,1) life span 5, on turn 82, countdown 5, so it will disappear after turn 86? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it will be present for L turns, disappearing after turn t + L - 1? Example: if L=1, it disappears after current turn, so only on this turn it can be eaten, gone next turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown = N, it can be eaten on turn t, then if not eaten, after turn t, countdown N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then after that turn it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,1): life span 5 at turn 82, so:\n> \n> Turn 82: countdown 5, present\n> \n> Turn 83: countdown 4, present\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 86: countdown 1, present\n> \n> Turn 87: countdown 0, disappears, so not present on turn 87.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 7: turn 82 countdown 7, present until turn 88 countdown 1, gone turn 89.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 10: present until turn 91 countdown 1, gone turn 92.\n> \n> But (4,3) is under body, so need body to move away.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, (6,2) is the tail, so moving to (6,2) might be possible if we can get there after the tail moves, but the tail will move when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> First, let's plan the action sequence for at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Current turn t=82, head at (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U or R.\n> \n> If I go U to (5,4), or R to (6,3).\n> \n> I need to think long-term.\n> \n> The snake is long, 19 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Let's map the grid to see free cells.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Also, snake occupies 19 cells, so free cells are few.\n> \n> Total cells: 8x8 = 64 cells.\n> \n> Walls: border walls: x=0, x=7 for all y, y=0, y=7 for all x, but corners shared, so number of border wall cells: top and bottom rows y=0 and y=7, each 8 cells, left and right columns x=0 and x=7, but corners (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) are included in both, so total border: 2*8 + 2*6 = 16 + 12 = 28? Better: for x=0, all y from 0 to 7: 8 cells, similarly x=7: 8 cells, y=0: x from 1 to 6 (since corners covered), no.\n> \n> Standard: the border cells are all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Number: for y=0, all x: 8 cells, y=7 all x: 8 cells, x=0 for y=1 to 6: 6 cells (since y=0 and y=7 covered), similarly x=7 for y=1 to 6: 6 cells.

Similarly others.\n> \n> Border walls are only at x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (1,1) is not border, it's internal obstacle.\n> \n> So total wall cells: 28 border + 5 internal = 33 wall cells.\n> \n> Snake: 19 cells occupied.\n> \n> So free cells: 64 - 33 - 19 = 12 cells? 64-33=31, minus 19=12 free cells.\n> \n> But some have food, but food is on snake body, so not free yet.\n> \n> Free cells are those not wall and not snake.\n> \n> Food positions are occupied by snake, so not free.\n> \n> So currently, only 12 free cells.\n> \n> List free cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except walls and snake.\n> \n> Walls: internal (1,1), (2,4), (3,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake positions: as above.\n> \n> For example, (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1) but (2,1) may be wall?

Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) should be accessible, but there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)]\n> \n> (1,1) is listed as an internal obstacle, but (1,1) might be a corner.

But (1,1) is on the border? No, x=0 and y=0 are walls, so (1,1) is inside but adjacent to walls. Similarly, (1,6) and (6,4) are inside.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,3), and the body follows: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1)]\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so from (6,3), moving right would go to (7,3), but x=7 is a wall, so that's invalid.

Let's see the order: positions[0] is head, positions[1] is the first body segment, which is (5,3). Since the snake moves, when I move, the head goes to a new position, and the tail moves away, so I can move to cells that are not occupied by the body except the tail, which will move.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail, it might be okay because the tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

If I move left to (5,3), that cell is occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, it will cause collision because after move, head is at (5,3), but that segment was there, and it doesn't move away immediately? When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the next position, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: if I move left to (5,3), which is currently occupied by position[1].

The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" except that moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is position[1], not the tail. If I move left to (5,3), the head is moving to a cell that is currently occupied by position[1], so it will collide with the body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body cell except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (6,1), which is far away.\n> \n> So from (6,3):\n> \n> - Up: (6,4) – is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells by snake: from positions: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> So (6,4) is not in this list, so it should be free, but let's check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,4) is x=6,y=4, which is within 1 to 6, so no wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) — (6,4) is an internal obstacle! Oh, (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (6,4), so (6,4) is not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) might be free?\n> \n> (6,2) is not in snake positions, not a wall, and internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4) — no (6,2), so (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> (7,3) is wall.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - Up: (6,4) but it's an obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (6,2) – seems free.\n> \n> - Left: (5,3) – occupied by body, not tail, so collision if moved there.\n> \n> - Right: (7,3) – wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (6,2)? But head direction is R, and there's no instant reverse, but since I'm moving down, not opposite, it should be fine.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, meaning it was moving right. Moving down is not opposite; opposite would be left, but left is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So only down is possible? But let's confirm food and other things.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,1, 4, 1) – this is (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Format: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> \n> So: (6,1, 4, 1) – probably (x,y) = (6,1), value=4? No, let's read: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6, 1, 4, 1) - (6, 2, 6, 1) - (4, 3, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> In the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 1, 4, 1) - (6, 2, 6, 1) - (4, 3, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> But it says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the tuple, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value)? No, the description says: \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but here it's listed as (6,1,4,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? I think it's inconsistent.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" then \"- (6, 1, 4, 1)\" – this is confusing.\n> \n> In the core rules, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state, it's given as (6,1,4,1) without parentheses for the position.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> I think it's a tuple: (x, y, life_span, value) or (x, y, value, life_span)? The core rules say: \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for each food, it's a tuple of (position, value, life_span), but position is (x,y).\n> \n> In the state input, it's written as (6,1,4,1), which might be shorthand for position (6,1) with life_span 4 and value 1? Or value 4 and life_span 1?\n> \n> I think I need to parse it.\n> \n> From the food list: \"- (6, 1, 4, 1)\" and it says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the core rules, it's value then life_span, but here it's listed with four numbers.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x, y, value, life_span) or (x, y, life_span, value)? The value is +1 or -1, so 1 is likely the value.\n> \n> Similarly, all have value 1 and life_span some number.\n> \n> First food: (6,1,4,1) – since value is usually +1 or -1, here it's 1, so probably value=1, life_span=4? Or vice versa.\n> \n> Second: (6,2,6,1) – value=1, life_span=6? Or value=6? But value should be +1 or -1 for positive or negative food, I think.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\", so value should be either +1 or -1.\n> \n> Here all values are 1, so probably value=1 for all, meaning all are positive food.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span: 4,6,9.\n> \n> So for (6,1): position (6,1), value=1, life_span=4\n> \n> (6,2): position (6,2), value=1, life_span=6\n> \n> (4,3): position (4,3), value=1, life_span=9\n> \n> But (4,3) is occupied by the snake! Position (4,3) is part of the snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions include (4,3), which is index 2.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3), but it's under the snake body. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So currently, (4,3) has food, but it's covered by snake body. To eat it, the snake must move away from that cell, and then head must move onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (6,1) and (6,2).\n> \n> (6,1) is also occupied by snake! Tail is at (6,1), so (6,1) has food under it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is not occupied, I think. Snake positions: (6,1) is tail, (6,2) is not listed, so (6,2) is free.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) with value 1, life_span 6.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From head at (6,3), only down to (6,2) is possible, since up is obstacle, left is body, right is wall.\n> \n> (6,2) has food! So if I move down to (6,2), I eat the food there.\n> \n> But let's check the life_span. Current turn t1=83, food at (6,2) has life_span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so if I move to it now, I eat it before it disappears.\n> \n> Life_span is the number of turns it remains, decreasing each turn including when it's spawned or current turn when we consider.\n> \n> For food at (6,2), life_span=6, at turn 83, it will disappear after turn 83 + 6 -1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for example, if food spawns at turn T with life_span N, it exists from turn T to turn T + N - 1, and disappears at turn T + N.\n> \n> Countdown starts at N on turn T, decreases to N-1 on turn T+1, ..., to 0 on turn T+N, when it disappears.\n> \n> But in the state, we have current turn, and food with life_span given, so we need to know when it was spawned.\n> \n> The state doesn't specify when it was spawned, only current life_span, which is the remaining turns.\n> \n> In the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" and life_span is given, so at current turn, the life_span is the number of turns left, including this turn.\n> \n> For example, food at (6,2) has life_span=6 at turn 83, so it can be eaten on turns 83,84,85,86,87,88, and disappears at turn 89.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life_span=4, so from turn 83 to 86, disappears at 87.\n> \n> (4,3) life_span=9, from 83 to 91, disappears at 92.\n> \n> But (4,3) is under snake body, so not accessible now.\n> \n> Now, back to move: only possible move is down to (6,2), which has food, so I can eat it.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Head is at (6,3), which is two cells away: (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1), so not adjacent. Adjacent means directly next to, like up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (6,3) and (6,1) are not adjacent; (6,2) is in between.\n> \n> So head is not adjacent to tail; tail is at (6,1), head at (6,3), so distance is 2 in y-direction.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,2), I eat the food at (6,2), which is positive, so snake grows: after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Then the new tail is still (6,1)? When you eat food, the tail stays in place for that turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, \"Length of snake +1\", so after move to food, head is at food, and tail does not move, so the new segment is added.\n> \n> So from positions: head moves to (6,2), and since food is eaten, tail remains, so the new positions: head (6,2), then old head (6,3) becomes body, and so on, down to tail (6,1) still there.\n> \n> Snake was 19 segments long? Positions have 19 cells: from index 0 to 18, so length 19.\n> \n> After eating, length 20, positions: new head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), ... up to (6,1), and (6,1) is still tail.\n> \n> Tail is still at (6,1), which has food under it, but that's separate.\n> \n> Now, is there any immediate danger? After move, head at (6,2), tail at (6,1), so they are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> But the tail reward danger is about eating the food that is on the tail cell when head is adjacent.\n> \n> Here, I'm eating food at (6,2), not at tail.\n> \n> Tail has food at (6,1), but I'm not eating it now.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> But after this move, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, the food at (6,1) is under the tail, so if tail moves away, it can be eaten later.\n> \n> But for now, moving to (6,2) seems the only choice, and it gives +1 score.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 83.\n> \n> Only down to (6,2) is possible, as per above.\n> \n> But is that true?\n> \n> Earlier I thought up to (6,4) is obstacle, left to (5,3) is body, right wall, so yes, only down.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (1,1) is internal obstacle, but x=1,y=1, which is corner, but since walls are at 0, it's fine, but obstacle blocks it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is obstacle.\n> \n> Now, cell (6,2): not wall, not obstacle, not snake except tail might move, but now it's free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,2) is not in the list, so free.\n> \n> So yes, only possible move is down to (6,2).\n> \n> So for turn 83, action must be D.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (6,2), head is at (6,2), and since food is eaten, the tail stays at (6,1), so new positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1) — tail is still (6,1), but since we ate food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1) ] so 20 positions, tail at (6,1).\n> \n> Head direction: I moved down, so new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, for next turn, turn 84, head at (6,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (6,3) — but (6,3) is now the second segment, position[1], which is body, not tail. Tail is at (6,1). (6,3) is occupied by body, so moving up would collide.\n> \n> - Down: to (6,1) — (6,1) is the tail. Moving to tail is allowed, because tail will move away. After move, head goes to (6,1), and tail moves to the next position, which is (5,1)? Let's see.\n> \n> Current positions before move: head (6,2), then body: (6,3), (5,3), ..., (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> If I move down to (6,1), which is current tail. After move, new head is at (6,1), and the tail segment moves to where? The body shifts: the last segment, which was at (6,1), is removed only if no food eaten; but since no food, tail moves.\n> \n> I didn't eat food, so the tail moves.\n> \n> When no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: if I move to (6,1), which is current tail, it is safe because after move, head is at (6,1), and the old tail (6,1) is no longer there; it moves to the previous position of the second last segment?

But old tail was at (6,1), and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the position (6,1) is now occupied by both the new head and the old tail? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail vacates its cell.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to new cell (with food), and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, thus snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose positions P = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to new cell C:\n> \n> - If C has no food: new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k}] where B_{k} is the second last, and T is vacated.\n> \n> - If C has food: new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so length increased by one, T remains.\n> \n> In the case where C is the current tail position: if I move to T, and T has food, then after move: new head at T, and the body includes H, B1, etc., and T is still there as tail?

It's turn 84. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, but the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? No, the walls occupy those cells, so snake cannot move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) inclusive? Let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1). So y-coordinates from 1 to 6, x from 3 to 6, but there are positions like (3,1), etc. (5,1) and (6,1) are present, so y=1 is playable? But walls at y=0, so y=1 should be playable. Similarly, x=1 to x=6 should be playable since walls at x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4)]. So these cells are blocked; snake cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, snake head direction is D, which is down. So current direction is down, meaning from (6,2) to (6,3) since head is at (6,2) and it moved down to (6,3)? Positions: [(6,2), (6,3), ...] so head at (6,2), and it's moving down to (6,3), so direction D means it's facing down.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (6,1,3,1) — this means (x,y, life_span, value). Format: (x,y, life_span, value). Value 1 is positive food, since value1=1.\n> \n> In the input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6, 1, 3, 1)\" so it's (x,y, life_span, value) = (6,1,3,1)\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3,8,1) so (x,y, life_span, value) = (4,3,8,1)\n> \n> Both have value 1, so both are positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,1), life_span=3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 84, life_span=3, so it will be there for turns 84,85,86? And disappear after turn 86, so on turn 87 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) life_span=8, so it will last until turn 84+8-1=91? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on the turn it spawns, life_span=N, and it decreases each turn.
