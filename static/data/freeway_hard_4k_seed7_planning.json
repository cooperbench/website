        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For a car, the span is given by head and tail positions. For left-moving cars, head is left, tail is right? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. Since it's moving left, decreasing x, so head should be the front, which for left-moving is smaller x? Let's see the example.\n\nFor left-moving: initial span [h, τ], after time, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. If s is positive, and moving left, x decreasing, so if h and τ are positions, and h < τ, then [h, τ] with h left, τ right? But when it moves left, both decrease, so the span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span [τ, h], and becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. So for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h], which might imply τ is tail, h is head, so head is in direction of motion.\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor direction: \"right\" means moving to the right, I assume.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn right-moving, it's written as [τ, h], so τ is the left end? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose a car moving right: at t1, tail at position τ, head at position h, with h > τ since it's moving right? But in the notation, for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h], and after time, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so if it's moving right, τ and h increase, so τ should be the left end, h the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ], and [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h decreases, τ decreases, so h is left, τ is right? This is inconsistent.\n\nLet me look at the car state.\n\nFor example, freeway 4: (-48, -59, right, 4) — wait, -48 and -59? Positions are x-coordinates, I assume.\n\nt1=0, so current turn.\n\nPlayer at (0,0), need to reach (0,9).\n\nCars on y=1 to 8.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nImportant: when you move to a new row, you are not on that row until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, and you won't be considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So you only check collision for the row you are currently on at that turn.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at t1=0.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and we can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, the minimum possible H is 9 turns if we go straight up, but we might hit cars, so we need to avoid them by waiting or moving down sometimes.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=0 to t=H-1, we take H actions to reach y=9 at turn H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so at turn t1 + t, we take action a, and after H actions, we should be at y=9.\n\nt1=0, so turns from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{k} at turn k, position becomes y_{k+1}.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, we are on y_T, and for some car on that row, 0 is in span(T).\n\nSince we are on y_T at turn T, we check the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nNow, for cars, their positions change over time based on speed and direction.\n\nGiven at t1=0.\n\nLet me list all cars and their spans at time t.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, the cars are given.\n\nFreeway k, which is y=k.\n\nk from 1 to 8.\n\nCar state:\n\ny=1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince direction right, and span given as (head h, tail τ), but in the update, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, and τ + sΔT, h + sΔT.\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, d, s), so for this car, head = -48, tail = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head has higher x? But here head=-48, tail=-59, -48 > -59, so head is at x=-48, tail at x=-59, so since moving right, head at -48, tail at -59, so the span is from tail to head: [ -59, -48 ]? But in the notation, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn this case, tail τ = -59, head h = -48, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3T, -48 + 3T] since t1=0.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but here all are right-moving except? Let's see all.\n\ny=2: (-48, -59, right, 3) same as y=1.\n\ny=3: (-48, -59, right, 3) same.\n\ny=4: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFor each, since right-moving, span at T: for first: τ=-59, h=-48, so [ -59 +4T, -48 +4T ]\n\nSecond: τ=-23? head h=-12, tail τ=-23, so [ -23 +4T, -12 +4T ]\n\nThird: head=24, tail=13, so [13 +4T, 24 +4T]? τ=13, h=24, so [τ + sT, h + sT] = [13 +4T, 24 +4T]\n\ny=5: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, speed 12, right, so span at T: [ -59 +12T, -48 +12T ]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, so [ -11 +12T, 0 +12T ] = [ -11 +12T, 12T ]\n\ny=6: same as y=5? (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12) so same as y=5.\n\ny=7: same, (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\ny=8: same, (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nAll cars are moving right.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on row y_T, and for some car on that row, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nThat is, min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) for that car's span at T.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nWe start at turn 0, position (0,0). At turn 0, we are on row y=0. But there are no cars on y=0, since cars are on y=1 to 8. So at turn 0, no collision possible, since no cars on row 0.\n\nSimilarly, when we reach y=9, there are no cars, so no issue.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, the critical part is when we are on a row with cars, we need that at that turn, 0 not in any car's span.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, their spans are shifting right over time.\n\nFor each row, I need to find times when it's safe to be on that row, meaning no car has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nBut since multiple cars per row, I need that for all cars on that row, 0 not in span at time T.\n\nThen, for the path, I need to choose when to be on which row.\n\nBut I have to move step by step.\n\nSince I can only change y by 1 per turn, I need to go through each row in order, but I can stay or move down, so I might linger on some rows or go down to avoid, but since I need to go to 9, probably I want to go up as much as possible, but avoid the times when cars are dangerous.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row, the times when it is unsafe to be on that row, i.e., when there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nFor row k, at time T, if for any car on row k, 0 is in [low, high] at T.\n\nThen it's unsafe at that T.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nSince the player is on row y at turn T, we care about per row per turn.\n\nBut for a given row, the unsafe times depend on the cars.\n\nLet's compute for each row the unsafe intervals.\n\nStart with y=1: one car, span at T: [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nSince -59 + 3T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3T ≤ 0 ⇒ 3T ≤ 59 ⇒ T ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so T ≤ 19 since T integer? T is turn number, integer.\n\nT is discrete, turns, so T integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 ≤ -48 + 3T ⇒ 48 ≤ 3T ⇒ T ≥ 16.\n\nSo 0 in span when T ≥ 16 and T ≤ 19.\n\nBecause T integer: T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFor T=16: low = -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0? -48 + 3*16 = -48 + 48 = 0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nT=17: low = -59 + 51 = -8, high = -48 + 51 = 3, [ -8, 3], 0 in.\n\nT=18: low = -59 + 54 = -5, high = -48 + 54 = 6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=19: low = -59 + 57 = -2, high = -48 + 57 = 9, [ -2,9], 0 in.\n\nT=20: low = -59 + 60 = 1, high = -48 + 60 = 12, [1,12], 0 not <= high? 0 < 1, not >= low, so 0 not in.\n\nT=15: low = -59 + 45 = -14, high = -48 + 45 = -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for y=1 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow y=2: same as y=1, one car (-48,-59,right,3), so same unsafe times: T=16 to 19.\n\ny=3: same, unsafe T=16 to 19.\n\nNow y=4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4), span at T: [ -59 +4T, -48 +4T ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +4T <= 0 <= -48 +4T\n\nWhich is 4T <= 59 => T <= 14.75, so T<=14\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +4T => 4T >=48 => T>=12\n\nSo T=12,13,14.\n\nFor T=12: low = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=13: low = -59 + 52 = -7, high = -48 + 52 = 4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14: low = -59 + 56 = -3, high = -48 + 56 = 8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=11: low = -59 + 44 = -15, high = -48 + 44 = -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nT=15: low = -59 + 60 = 1, high = -48 + 60 = 12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4), span at T: [ τ + sT, h + sT] = [ -23 +4T, -12 +4T ]\n\n0 in if -23 +4T <= 0 <= -12 +4T\n\nSo 4T <=23 => T<=5.75, T<=5\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +4T => 4T >=12 => T>=3\n\nSo T=3,4,5.\n\nT=3: low= -23 +12= -11, high= -12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=4: low= -23+16= -7, high= -12+16=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=5: low= -23+20= -3, high= -12+20=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=2: low= -23+8= -15, high= -12+8= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nT=6: low= -23+24=1, high= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4), head=24, tail=13, so [τ +sT, h+sT] = [13 +4T, 24 +4T]\n\n0 in if 13+4T <= 0 <= 24+4T\n\nBut 13+4T <=0? 4T <= -13, impossible since T>=0, 4T>=0, so always false. So 0 never in span for this car, since min is 13 at T=0, increasing.\n\nSo for y=4, unsafe when any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car unsafe T=3,4,5\n\nThird car always safe.\n\nSo overall, y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow y=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at T: [ -59 +12T, -48 +12T ]\n\n0 in if -59 +12T <= 0 <= -48 +12T\n\n12T <=59 => T<=59/12≈4.916, T<=4\n\n12T >=48 => T>=4\n\nT=4: low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=5: low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=4 is the only possibility? T>=4 and T<=4, so only T=4.\n\nT=4: from above, 0 in.\n\nT=3: low= -59+36= -23, high= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=5: as above, not in.\n\nSo first car unsafe only at T=4.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12), head=0, tail=-11, so [τ +sT, h+sT] = [ -11 +12T, 0 +12T ] = [ -11 +12T, 12T ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12T <= 0 <= 12T\n\nFirst: -11 +12T <=0 => 12T <=11 => T<=11/12<1, so T<=0 since T integer? T=0.\n\nT=0: low= -11 +0 = -11, high=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\n0 <= 12T is always true for T>=0.\n\nBut -11+12T <=0 only for T<=11/12, so only T=0.\n\nT=0: -11 +0 <=0 <=0, yes 0<=0 true.\n\nT=1: low= -11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not <= high? 0<1, not in.\n\nT=0: [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nBut at T=0, we are at turn 0, player is at y=0, but row y=5, we are not on y=5 at turn 0, so for collision on row k, it only matters when we are on that row at that turn.\n\nAt T=0, for row y=5, if we were on it, but we are not, so it might be unsafe at T=0, but we don't care unless we are there.\n\nFor the row, it is unsafe at T if a car covers 0.\n\nBut for us, we care only if we are on that row at that turn.\n\nSo for y=5, second car: at T=0, span [ -11, 0], 0 in, so if we are on y=5 at turn 0, we collide, but we start at turn 0 on y=0.\n\nFirst car unsafe at T=4.\n\nSecond car unsafe at T=0 only? T=0.\n\nBut T=0: second car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, are there other times? For second car, only T=0, since for T=1, min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly, first car only T=4.\n\nSo y=5 unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nT=0: because of second car.\n\nT=4: because of first car.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\ny=6: same as y=5? Cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car same: unsafe only at T=4? Let's compute.\n\nFirst car: [ -59 +12T, -48 +12T ]\n\n0 in: T=4 as before.\n\nSecond car: [ -11 +12T, 12T ]\n\n0 in: -11+12T <=0 <=12T\n\n-11+12T <=0 => 12T <=11 => T<=0.916, so T=0\n\nAnd 0<=12T always for T>=0.\n\nSo only T=0.\n\nThus y=6 unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\ny=7: same, unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\ny=8: same, unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nNow, we also have rows y=1,2,3 with unsafe times.\n\ny=1: unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: unsafe T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=6: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=7: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=8: unsafe T=0,4\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 no cars, always safe.\n\nWe start at turn 0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end.\n\nSince we move step by step, the number of turns depends on how we move.\n\nThe minimal H might be achieved by going up as fast as possible, but avoiding the unsafe times.\n\nSince unsafe times are early for some rows and late for others, we might need to wait or adjust.\n\nFirst, let's consider the direct path: go up every turn.\n\nStart at turn 0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn 1, y=1? Let's sequence:\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt turn 0: y=0, we take a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nThen at turn 1, we are at y_1, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if on y_t and unsafe at t.\n\nFor the path, we need for each turn t, when on y_t, it must be safe at time t.\n\nNow, for direct up: actions all U, so y_t = t for t from 0 to 9, but y_0=0, after a_0=U, y_1=1, at turn 1 y=1; a_1=U, y_2=2, at turn 2 y=2; ... up to at turn 9, y_9=9? Let's see:\n\nAfter H actions, we should be at y_H =9.\n\nStart turn t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nIf a_0=U, Δy=+1, y_1=1\n\nAt turn t=1, position y=1\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn k, position y_k.\n\nTo have y_H =9, we need after H actions, at turn H, y=9.\n\nSince we start at turn 0, y=0, and each U increases y by 1, after exactly 9 U actions, at turn 9, y=9.\n\nBut we can have S or D, so it might take more turns.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut let's check for direct path with all U.\n\nTurn t, y_t = t.\n\nNow, check for each t, on row y=t, is it safe at time t.\n\nt from 0 to 8, since at t=9, y=9, no cars.\n\ny_t = t for t=0 to 8? At turn t, y_t = t.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe, no cars.\n\nt=1: y=1, at time t=1, is row 1 safe? From above, y=1 unsafe only at T=16-19, t=1 not in, so safe.\n\nt=2: y=2, time t=2, unsafe times 16-19, not 2, safe.\n\nt=3: y=3, time t=3, unsafe 16-19, not 3, safe.\n\nt=4: y=4, time t=4. Now y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14. So T=4 is unsafe. Oh, collision.\n\nAt turn t=4, y=4, and T=4 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: y=5, time t=5. y=5 unsafe at T=0 and T=4. t=5 not unsafe, so safe? y=5 unsafe only T=0 and T=4, so at T=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=6: y=6, T=6, unsafe only T=0,4, so safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, T=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=8, T=8, unsafe only T=0,4, so safe.\n\nt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=4, on y=4, T=4, unsafe, so collision.\n\nThus direct path has collision at t=4.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nPossible ways: at some point, stay or move down to delay or avoid the unsafe time.\n\nSince y=4 is unsafe at T=4, we need not to be on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nWe could be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we go slower, or faster but we can't go faster than one per turn.\n\nMinimal y change per turn is 0, so we can stay.\n\nOr move down, but that might not help directly.\n\nLet's think about the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, rows y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nBut T=0 is past, we are not on those rows at T=0, so for future, only T=4 is critical for y=5-8.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 unsafe late at T=16-19.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12-14.\n\nSince we start at T=0, and we want min time, probably we can avoid the early unsafe times by waiting.\n\nFor example, at y=4, unsafe at T=3,4,5, so we should avoid being on y=4 at T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, we need to avoid T=4.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=4, so we cannot be on y=5 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 at T=4.\n\nNow, since we move step by step, let's plan the path.\n\nWe start at turn 0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=1.\n\ny=1 is safe at all times except T=16-19, which are late, so at early times, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 and y=3.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nWe need to be on y=4 when T not in {3,4,5}, so T<=2 or T>=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe at T=4, so avoid T=4.\n\ny=6,7,8 same, avoid T=4.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at T=4, so we must not be on any of them at turn 4.\n\nAlso, for y=4, we must not be on it at T=3,4,5.\n\nNow, since we have to go through all rows, let's think about the sequence.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=3 quickly.\n\nFrom start:\n\nTurn 0: y=0, safe. We can go U to y=1.\n\nAfter a0=U, at turn 1, y=1.\n\nTurn 1: y=1, safe (since T=1 not unsafe). We can go U to y=2.\n\nTurn 2: y=2, safe (T=2), go U to y=3.\n\nTurn 3: y=3, now at T=3, y=3 is safe? y=3 unsafe only at T=16-19, T=3 not in, so safe. We can go U to y=4.\n\nBut if we go U at turn 3, then at turn 4, we are at y=4 (since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so if at turn t=3, y=3, a3=U, then y4=4, and at turn 4, y=4.\n\nBut T=4, y=4 is unsafe, as we saw.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 3, if we do not go up, but stay or down.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn 3, y=3, safe.\n\nIf we stay, a3=S, then y4=3, at turn 4, y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at T=4, since unsafe only 16-19.\n\nThen at turn 4, y=3, we can go U to y=4.\n\nBut now at turn 5, y=4, T=5.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at T=5? From earlier, y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5, so T=5 also unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=4 at turn 5, still unsafe.\n\nT=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo if we arrive at y=4 at turn 5, collision.\n\nWe need to arrive at y=4 when T not in {3,4,5}, so T<=2 or T>=6.\n\nT<=2: at turn 2, y=2, if we go to y=4 directly? But we can only change by 1 per turn, so we cannot go from y=2 to y=4 in one turn. Must go through y=3.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=4 is turn 3: if we go up each turn from 0.\n\nTurn 0: y=0, U to y=1\n\nTurn 1: y=1, U to y=2\n\nTurn 2: y=2, U to y=3\n\nTurn 3: y=3, U to y=4 → at turn 4, y=4, T=4 unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 3, we stay: a3=S, then y4=3, at turn 4, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, we can go U to y=4, but at turn 5, y=4, T=5 unsafe.\n\nOr at turn 4, if we stay again, a4=S, y5=3, at turn 5, y=3 safe, then at turn 5, U to y=4, at turn 6, y=4, T=6.\n\nNow T=6, is y=4 safe? From earlier, y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14. T=6 not in, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we can stay at y=3 for a couple of turns.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Turn 0: y=0, U to y=1 → at turn 1, y=1\n\n- Turn 1: y=1, U to y=2 → at turn 2, y=2\n\n- Turn 2: y=2, U to y=3 → at turn 3, y=3\n\nNow at turn 3, y=3, instead of U, we do S: a3=S, so y4=3, at turn 4, y=3\n\nAt turn 4, y=3, we can do S again: a4=S, y5=3, at turn 5, y=3\n\nThen at turn 5, y=3, U to y=4 → at turn 6, y=4, T=6, which is safe for y=4.\n\nNow, from y=4, we need to go to higher rows.\n\ny=5 to 8 have unsafe at T=4, but T=4 is past, so for future, only need to avoid T=4, but T=4 is over, so for T>4, y=5,6,7,8 are safe except possibly other times, but for y=5-8, unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, so for T>4, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 unsafe late, but we are past them.\n\ny=4 we are at T=6.\n\nNow, from turn 6, y=4, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are safe for all T except T=4, which is over.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nWe can go straight up from here.\n\nAt turn 6: y=4, U to y=5 → at turn 7, y=5\n\nTurn 7: y=5, U to y=6 → turn 8, y=6\n\nTurn 8: y=6, U to y=7 → turn 9, y=7\n\nTurn 9: y=7, U to y=8 → turn 10, y=8\n\nTurn 10: y=8, U to y=9 → turn 11, y=9\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe reached at turn 11.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe used two extra turns by staying at y=3 twice.\n\nCan we do with less?\n\nFor example, instead of staying twice, stay only once?\n\nIf at turn 3, y=3, we stay: a3=S, then at turn 4, y=3.\n\nThen at turn 4, we go U to y=4, but at turn 5, y=4, T=5 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt turn 3, go down? But that might not help.\n\ny=4 is unsafe from T=3 to5, so we need to be on y=4 at T<=2 or T>=6.\n\nT<=2 impossible since we start at T=0, y=0, at T=2 we are at y=2 max.\n\nSo only possibility is T>=6.\n\nThus we must reach y=4 at turn 6 or later.\n\nIn the above, we reached at turn 6.\n\nNow, from y=4 at T=6, we go up to y=5 at T=7, etc.\n\nEach up takes one turn, so to go from y=4 to y=9, that's 5 steps: to y=5 at T=7, y=6 at T=8, y=7 at T=9, y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nTotal turns from start: we started at T=0, reached y=9 at T=11, so H=12 actions? Let's count the actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from turn 0 to turn 10, we take actions to reach y=11 at turn 11? Let's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn t | action a_t | y_{t+1} position after action\n\nAt turn t, after action, we have y_{t+1}, but the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At time (turn) t, position is y_t\n\n- Take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n- At time t+1, position y_{t+1}\n\nFor collision, at time t, position y_t, we check if unsafe on row y_t at time t.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\na0=U, so y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, safe\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, safe\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, safe\n\na3=S, y4=3 (since Δy=0)\n\nt=4: y=3, safe\n\na4=S, y5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, safe\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, safe (T=6)\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, safe (since T=7 not 0 or 4)\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, safe\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, safe\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nNow at t=11, y=11? y11=9, which is the position at turn 11.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so when y_t=9 for some t.\n\nHere at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThe number of actions: from t=0 to t=10, we took 11 actions (a0 to a10), and at turn 11, we are at y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence? The sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so after H actions, we should be at y=9.\n\nHere, with actions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions (t=0 to 10 inclusive is 11 actions), and at turn 11, y=9.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, number of actions H.\n\nAfter last action at turn t1 + (H-1), position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nHere t1=0, so after action at turn H-1, y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after action a_{k} at turn k, y_{k+1} is set.\n\nSo to have y_H =9, we take actions up to turn H-1, then y_H=9.\n\nFor example, if H=9, actions from t=0 to 8, then y_9=9.\n\nBut in our case, with delays, we have y_11=9, so actions from t=0 to 10, H=11 actions.\n\nCan we do with less than 11?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=4 earlier than T=6.\n\nBut y=4 must be at T>=6, so earliest T=6 to be safe.\n\nWe reached at T=6.\n\nNow, from there to y=9, we need 5 more steps: to y=5 at T=7, y=6 at T=8, etc., up to y=9 at T=11.\n\nIs there a way to go faster? No, because we can only increase y by 1 per turn max.\n\nUnless we can skip some rows, but no, we have to go through each.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at some point, we can move down to avoid, but in this case, since y=4 is unsafe only at T=3,4,5, and we are before, we had to wait.\n\nBut we waited at y=3.\n\nCould we have gone to y=4 before T=3?\n\nFor example, if we start and go up fast, but at T=0, y=0; T=1, y=1; T=2, y=2; T=3, y=3; cannot have y=4 before T=4? At T=3, we are at y=3, we can go to y=4 at T=4, which is unsafe.\n\nAt T=2, we are at y=2, we can only go to y=3 at T=3, not directly to y=4.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=4 before T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=3, not y=4.\n\nSo we must be on y=4 at T>=6.\n\nThus minimal to reach y=4 is at T=6, with some waiting.\n\nIn the above, we used two S actions at y=3.\n\nBut we could use fewer S actions if we start later, but we start at T=0.\n\nAnother thought: we might go up to y=4 after T=5, but since we have to go through y=3, and from y=3 to y=4 takes one turn, if we are on y=3 at T, we go to y=4 at T+1.\n\nTo have y=4 at T>=6, we need to go from y=3 to y=4 at some turn after T=5, so the action must be at turn >=5, so that at turn >=6, y=4.\n\nFor example, if at turn 5, we are on y=3, and we do U, then at turn 6, y=4.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be on y=3 at turn 5.\n\nHow to be on y=3 at turn 5.\n\nFrom start, we can reach y=3 at turn 3 with no delay: t=0 to t=2 as before.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, but if we stay there until t=5.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, we can do S at t=3 and t=4, so at t=4, y=3, t=5, y=3, then U at t=5 to y=4 at t=6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we go slower earlier, but that might not help, since we can be faster to y=3.\n\nFor example, if we delay at lower rows, but y=1,2,3 are safe at early times, so better to go up fast to y=3, then wait.\n\nWe could go to y=3 later, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 or y=1 for some turns, then reach y=3 later, but since y=4 needs T>=6, if we reach y=3 later, say at T=4, then we can go to y=4 at T=5, but T=5 unsafe for y=4.\n\nIf we reach y=3 at T=5, then go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut to reach y=3 at T=5, we need to take more time from start.\n\nFor example, start: t=0 y=0, if we do S, then t=1 y=0, still, then go up, but it takes longer to reach y=3.\n\nMinimal to reach y=3 is at T=3 with all U.\n\nIf we add delays before, we reach y=3 later, but we still need to wait at y=3 until T=5 to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut if we reach y=3 at T=5, we don't need to wait, but we spent extra turns getting to y=3.\n\nFor example: t=0 y=0, S (delay), a0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1 y=0, U to y=1? Let's see.\n\nt=0: y=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1: y=0, a1=U, y2=1\n\nt=2: y=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, a4=U, but if U, y5=4 at t=5, unsafe.\n\nBetter: at t=4, y=3, do S, a4=S, y5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nSame as before, but we added one extra turn at start.\n\nt=0: S, y1=0\n\nThen t=1: y=0, U to y=1? After action, at t=1 position y=1? No.\n\nt=0: position y=0, a0=S, so y1=0 (position at turn 1)\n\nt=1: position y=0, a1=U, then y2=1\n\nt=2: position y=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: position y=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: position y=3, a4=S, y5=3\n\nt=5: position y=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nThen same from there, but we have one extra turn (t=0 we did S, but no progress), so we reach y=4 at t=6 still, but now we have more turns: for example, to go to y=9, from t=6 y=4, U at t=6 to y=5 at t=7, ..., up to t=10: y=7, a10=U to y=8 at t=11, then t=11 y=8, a11=U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nSo we reached at t=12, worse than 11.\n\nSimilarly, if we delay at other points, it adds turns.\n\nSo minimal is to go straight to y=3 by t=3, then stay at y=3 for two turns (t=3 and t=4 actions S), so at t=5 position y=3, then U to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen up to y=9.\n\nNow, in the up part, from y=4 to y=9, we need to pass y=5 to y=8.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, which are past, so for T>4, they are always safe.\n\nSo we can go straight up.\n\nBut is there any other unsafe time? For y=1,2,3, unsafe at T=16-19, but we are at T=6 to 11, which is before, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe at T=12-14, but we are at T=6, which is before, so safe.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have:\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: U (to y=1)\n\nt=1: U (to y=2)\n\nt=2: U (to y=3)\n\nt=3: S (stay at y=3)\n\nt=4: S (stay at y=3) — at t=4 position y=3\n\nt=5: U (to y=4) — at t=5 position y=3, action U, so y6=4, position at t=6 is y=4\n\nThen t=6: U to y=5\n\nt=7: U to y=6\n\nt=8: U to y=7\n\nt=9: U to y=8\n\nt=10: U to y=9\n\nAt t=10, we take action U, so y11=9, position at turn 11 is y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions (H=11).\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t=0 to turn t=10.\n\nThe answer should list the actions starting from turn t1=0.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut we need to confirm if we can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10, then actions from t=0 to t=9, then after a9, y10=9.\n\nSo we need to reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nThat means we must be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 10, we need to have increased y by 9 from start, so exactly 9 U actions, and no S or D that don't change y, but we can have S, but S doesn't increase y, so if we have S, we need more turns.\n\nWith H actions, the net y increase must be 9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nEach S adds a turn without progress.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if all U and no collision.\n\nBut we have collision at t=4 if we go straight.\n\nWith H=10, we have one less action than H=11, but we need net +9 in y.\n\nWith H=10 actions, we can have, for example, 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U but that would overshoot, but y max 9, so we cannot go above 9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so we can have exactly 9 U and possibly some S or D, but D would decrease y, so we need more U to compensate, which takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal actions: to increase y by 9, with steps of +1,0,-1, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, the minimal number of actions is 9, achieved with all U, but we have collision.\n\nIf we have one S, that means 9 U and one S, total 10 actions, y increases to 9, but we might avoid collision by choosing when to S.\n\nSimilarly, with D, we need extra U, so more actions, worse.\n\nSo for H=10, possible with 9 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, can we find such a sequence?\n\nWe need to place the S somewhere to avoid the collision point.\n\nThe collision in straight path is at t=4, y=4.\n\nWe need not to be at y=4 at t=4.\n\nSince we must pass y=4 at some point.\n\nWe could be at y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we delay before y=4.\n\nSuppose we go slower to y=3.\n\nFor instance:\n\nt=0: y=0, U to y=1 (a0=U)\n\nt=1: y=1, S for example? a1=S, then y2=1, position at t=2 is y=1\n\nThen t=2: y=1, U to y=2, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, U to y=3, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, now if we U, y5=4 at t=5, but T=5 unsafe for y=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, S, a4=S, y5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, U to y=4, y6=4 at t=6, safe.\n\nBut now we have an extra S at t=1, so we are behind.\n\nFrom here: t=6: y=4, U to y=5, t=7 y=5\n\n...\n\nUp to t=10: we need y10=9.\n\nAt t=6 y=4, after U at t=6, y7=5 at t=7\n\nt=7 y=5, U to y=6 at t=8\n\nt=8 y=6, U to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9 y=7, U to y=8 at t=10? After action at t=9, y10=8\n\nThen at t=10, position y=8, we need to go to y=9, so a10=U, y11=9 at t=11.\n\nBut with H=10, we stop at a9, y10= something.\n\nIn this case, at t=9, we are at y=7 (position), a9=U to y=8, so at t=10 position y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=10, we need to be at y=8 at t=9, then U to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut in the above, with delays, we are at y=4 at t=6, then to y=5 at t=7, y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, then at t=9 we can U to y=8 at t=10, but y=9 at t=10 not reached.\n\nWe need one more step.\n\nTo reach y=9 earlier, we need less delay.\n\nBut with one S, we can have 9 U and 1 S.\n\nTotal actions 10, net +9.\n\nNow, where to place the S.\n\nSuppose we place the S not at the beginning but later.\n\nFor example, go straight to y=3 as before.\n\nt=0: U, y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: U, y=2 at t=2\n\nt=2: U, y=3 at t=3\n\nNow at t=3, y=3, we need to avoid being at y=4 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nIf we do S at t=3, then y4=3 at t=4\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, we can U to y=4 at t=5, but t=5 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=3, we do D? a3=D, then y4=2 at t=4\n\nThen at t=4, y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=3 at t=5, y5=3\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=6, y6=4, safe.\n\nBut now we have used a D and extra moves.\n\nFrom t=3: D to y=2 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=2, U to y=3 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=3, U to y=4 at t=6\n\nThen from y=4 at t=6, U to y=5 at t=7, ..., up to y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9: from y=4 at t=6, to y=5 t=7, y=6 t=8, y=7 t=9, y=8 t=10, then at t=10 y=8, a10=U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAgain t=11.\n\nWith the D, we have one extra action.\n\nActions: t=0 U, t=1 U, t=2 U, t=3 D (down to y=2), t=4 U (to y=3), t=5 U (to y=4), t=6 U (to y=5), t=7 U (to y=6), t=8 U (to y=7), t=9 U (to y=8), t=10 U (to y=9) — 11 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we used D instead of S, but still 11 actions.\n\nNow, back to H=10 with one S.\n\nSuppose we place the S at a different row.\n\nFor example, at y=3, but if we S at t=3, we are stuck with unsafe at t=5 if we go to y=4.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=4 at T=2, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is unsafe at T=3,4,5, but T=3: at T=3, if we are not on y=4, but we could be on other rows.\n\nIn the straight path, at T=4 we are on y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we can be on a different row at T=4.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point we move down.\n\nBut let's think about T=4.\n\nAt T=4, we must not be on y=4, and also not on y=5,6,7,8 because they are unsafe at T=4.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at T=4.\n\ny=1,2,3 are safe at T=4.\n\nSo at turn 4, we must be on y=1,2, or 3.\n\nIn particular, y=3 is safe.\n\nNow, in the sequence, if we are on y=3 at T=4, then we can go to y=4 later.\n\nBut as before.\n\nWith H=10, we need to reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nSo we must have progressed faster in some way, but we can't.\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 at T=6 as before, but then from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps, from T=6 to T=11, as before.\n\nIf we can be at higher y earlier, but we can't because we have to go through y=4 late.\n\nPerhaps we can skip waiting by moving to a row that is safe.\n\nAnother thought: for rows y=5-8, they are safe except T=4, so after T=4, they are fine.\n\nBut y=4 has multiple unsafe times, but we are dealing with T=6.\n\nIn our path, with 11 actions, we have two S actions.\n\nBut for H=10, we need only one extra action besides the 9 U, so one S.\n\nBut with one S, we might not avoid the collision.\n\nFor example, suppose we do:\n\nt=0: U to y=1\n\nt=1: U to y=2\n\nt=2: U to y=3\n\nt=3: S (stay y=3)  // one S\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, safe\n\nNow if we U at t=4, to y=4 at t=5, but t=5 unsafe for y=4.\n\nIf we do something else, but we have to go up.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, we U to y=4 at t=5, unsafe.\n\nNo choice.\n\nIf we do not S at t=3, but at another time.\n\nSuppose at t=2, we S instead.\n\nt=0: U to y=1\n\nt=1: U to y=2\n\nt=2: S (stay y=2) // a2=S, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, U to y=3, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, U to y=4, y5=4 at t=5, unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nt=0: S (stay y=0) // delay early\n\na0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1: y=0, U to y=1, y2=1\n\nt=2: y=1, U to y=2, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, U to y=3, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, U to y=4, y5=4 at t=5 unsafe.\n\nStill.\n\nThen at t=4, if S: a4=S, y5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, U to y=4, y6=4 safe.\n\nBut then to reach y=9: from t=5 y=3, U to y=4 at t=6, then U to y=5 at t=7, ..., U to y=8 at t=10? Let's see:\n\nt=5: y=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nAt t=10, y=8, not 9. We need a10 to go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut for H=10, we take actions up to t=9, so y10=8, not 9.\n\nIf we want y10=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nWith one S, we must have the S such that we don't lose progress at critical point.\n\nBut in all cases, to avoid being on y=4 at t=4 or t=5, we need to be on y=3 at t=4 or something, and go to y=4 later, which requires an extra turn.\n\nThus H=10 is not possible; we need at least H=11.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=4 at T=6 with only one wait, but earlier we needed two S or equivalent.\n\nIn the first sequence with two S at y=3.\n\nBut with one S, we cannot delay enough.\n\nAnother idea: since for y=5-8, they are safe after T=4, we could go to them directly if possible, but we have to go through y=4.\n\nUnless we can be on y=4 at T=6, and go up fast, but still 5 steps to y=9.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence I have, at t=3 and t=4, we do S, but t=3 and t=4 actions are both S? In terms of actions:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U  // to y=4 at t=6\n\nTurn 6: U  // to y=5 at t=7\n\nTurn 7: U  // to y=6 at t=8\n\nTurn 8: U  // to y=7 at t=9\n\nTurn 9: U  // to y=8 at t=10\n\nTurn 10: U // to y=9 at t=11\n\nIn the action list, turn 10: U, then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns from t1=0 to H-1.\n\nHere H=11 actions, from turn 0 to 10.\n\nIn the answer, list actions for each turn.\n\nWe also need to make sure that at all points, no collision.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, safe (T=1)\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, safe\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, safe (T=3)\n\na3=S, y4=3 (since Δy=0)\n\nt=4: y=3, safe (T=4)\n\na4=S, y5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, safe\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, safe (T=6)\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, safe (T=7)\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, safe\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, safe\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nAll safe, and reached at turn 11.\n\nIn the action for turn t, it determines the move to next position.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nNow, for the cars, I think I covered all.\n\nBut let me double-check for example at t=7, y=5.\n\ny=5 at T=7.\n\nUnsafe times for y=5: T=0 and T=4.\n\nT=7 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=4 at T=6, unsafe times T=3,4,5,12,13,14, T=6 not, safe.\n\nGood.\n\nIs there a way with H=10? I don't think so, but to confirm.\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 at T=6 with only one S.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=4 at T=6 but with only 10 actions.\n\nBut to reach y=4 at T=6, we need to have taken actions from T=0 to T=5 to be at y=4 at T=6.\n\nAt T=0, y=0.\n\nAfter 6 actions (t=0 to t=5), we should be at y=4 at turn 6.\n\nNet increase: from y=0 to y=4, +4, so with 6 actions, we must have 4 U and 2 other actions that don't increase y, e.g., S or D.\n\nBut D decreases, so if D, we need more U.\n\nEasier with S.\n\nSo possible sequences: for example, U,U,U, then two S at some point, but we need to be at y=4 at turn 6.\n\nIf we go U at t=0,1,2 to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen if S at t=3, y=3 at t=4.\n\nS at t=4, y=3 at t=5.\n\nThen U at t=5, y=4 at t=6. But this is 6 actions to reach y=4 at t=6, but we used two S.\n\nWith one S: suppose U at t=0 to y=1\n\nU at t=1 to y=2\n\nThen S at t=2: a2=S, y3=2 (position at t=3)\n\nThen U at t=3: to y=3 at t=4\n\nU at t=4: to y=4 at t=5, but t=5 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nU at t=0 to y=1\n\nS at t=1: a1=S, y2=1 (t=2 position y=1)\n\nU at t=2 to y=2 at t=3\n\nU at t=3 to y=3 at t=4\n\nU at t=4 to y=4 at t=5, unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nD at some point: but D would require extra U later.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=2, D to y=1 at t=3, then later need to go back, takes more actions.\n\nThus, to reach y=4 at T=6 safely, we need exactly two S actions or equivalent delays in the first part.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, list actions from turn 0 to turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 is the last action.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for y=4, there was a car at (24,13,right,4), which we said always safe, but just to confirm.\n\nAt T=6, span [13+4*6, 24+4*6] = [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not near 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=5, at T=7, cars: first car [-59+12*7, -48+12*7]= [-59+84, -48+84]=[25,36], not 0.\n\nSecond car [-11+12*7, 12*7]= [-11+84,84]=[73,84], not 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the minimal sequence with H=11.\n\nNow, write the actions.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the unsafe times on certain rows due to car positions.\n\n### Key Unsafe Times:\n- **Rows \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\) (but these are late and not relevant for early turns).\n- **Row \\(y = 4\\)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) and \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\). To be safe, must be on \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T \\leq 2\\) or \\(T \\geq 6\\). Since \\(T \\leq 2\\) is impossible (start at \\(T = 0\\), must be on \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T \\geq 6\\).\n- **Rows \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 0\\) and \\(T = 4\\). Since \\(T = 0\\) is past and \\(T = 4\\) is early, these rows are safe for \\(T > 4\\).\n\n### Path Planning:\n- The direct upward path (all \"U\" actions) causes a collision at turn \\(T = 4\\) on \\(y = 4\\).\n- To avoid this, stay at \\(y = 3\\) for two turns (turns 3 and 4) using \"S\" actions, reaching \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(T = 6\\), which is safe.\n- From \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\), proceed upward with \"U\" actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- This requires 11 actions (\\(H = 11\\)) to achieve \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 0**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1. Safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars.\n- **Turn 1**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 2. Safe, as \\(T = 1\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 1\\).\n- **Turn 2**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 3. Safe, as \\(T = 2\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 2\\).\n- **Turn 3**: \"S\" → Stays at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 4. Safe, as \\(T = 3\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 3\\).\n- **Turn 4**: \"S\" → Stays at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 5. Safe, as \\(T = 4\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 3\\).\n- **Turn 5**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6. Safe, as \\(T = 6\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 4\\).\n- **Turn 6**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7. Safe, as \\(T = 7 > 4\\) and not unsafe for \\(y = 5\\).\n- **Turn 7**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8. Safe, as \\(T = 8 > 4\\) and not unsafe for \\(y = 6\\).\n- **Turn 8**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9. Safe, as \\(T = 9 > 4\\) and not unsafe for \\(y = 7\\).\n- **Turn 9**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10. Safe, as \\(T = 10 > 4\\) and not unsafe for \\(y = 8\\).\n- **Turn 10**: \"U\" → Moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. Safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns (\\(H = 11\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t=4. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has one or more cars with positions that move left or right based on their direction and speed. Collision happens if at any turn T, when the player is on freeway y_T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new freeway, they are not considered on that freeway until the next turn, so they only check for collisions on the freeway they are currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 4 onwards to get to y=9 quickly without colliding.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car positions at turn t=4, since that's the current state.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars are given with head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction \"right\" means the car is moving to the right, so its position increases over time.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving cars, the head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the update:\n\n- Left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving cars, at time t1, span is [τ, h], so τ is the tail and h is the head, with τ < h since it's moving right.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\n-36 and -47, but -36 > -47, so if it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail, so here h = -36, τ = -47? -36 > -47, so head is -36, tail is -47? That seems odd because usually we think of positions increasing, but mathematically, since it's moving right, the head should be to the right of tail.\n\nPosition: tail at -47, head at -36, so the car spans from -47 to -36? But -47 is left, -36 is right, so if moving right, positions increase.\n\nAt t1=4, for freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSo span at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 3(T-4), -36 + 3(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nThat is, for a car, min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) at time T.\n\nSince span is an interval.\n\nAlso, note that the player is at x=0 always, so only the y-position matters for which freeway, and we care if x=0 is covered by a car on that row at that time.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at t=4.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, with freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so the player can be there safely.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so once we reach y=9, we're done, no need to worry about cars.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from t=4 onwards.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from t=4 to t=4+H-1, with y_{4+H-1} =9.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at the end of the turn, y_{t+1} is the new position.\n\nBut for collision, it says: collision occurs at turn T only if when the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 in span for some car on that freeway.\n\n\"at turn T\" — I think this means during turn T, when the player is on y_T.\n\nAlso, the note: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at turn T, it's only based on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at a new freeway, it's at turn T+1.\n\nSo, for a given turn T, player is on freeway y_T (at the start), and we check if on that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nTime T corresponds to turn T.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at t1=4, so we can compute for any T >4.\n\nt1=4 is current turn, so for turn T, time elapsed is T - t1 = T -4.\n\nLet τ = T - t1 = T -4, so at turn T, time since start is τ.\n\nThen for a car with speed s, position change is s * (T-4) in the direction.\n\nFor right-moving car: span at T: [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] where τ and h are from t=4.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-36, -47, right, 3) so head h=-36, tail τ=-47\n\nFreeway 2: similar, (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-32, -43, right, 4), (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4)\n\n(4, -7, right, 4): head=4, tail=-7? But for right-moving, if head=4, tail=-7, that means tail at -7, head at 4, so span from -7 to 4 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, (40,29, right,4): head=40, tail=29, so from 29 to 40.\n\nAnd (-32,-43,right,4): head=-32, tail=-43, from -43 to -32.\n\nFreeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\n(0, -11, right, 12): head=0, tail=-11, so at t=4, span from -11 to 0? Head=0, tail=-11, so min=-11, max=0.\n\nSimilarly, (48,37,right,12): head=48, tail=37, min=37, max=48.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, for collision on a freeway at turn T, we need that for some car on that row, 0 is in [min, max] of its span at time T.\n\nFor a right-moving car with tail τ, head h at t=4, speed s, at time T, min = τ + s(T-4), max = h + s(T-4)\n\nThen 0 in [min, max] iff min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nSince we care about x=0, we need when min <= 0 <= max for some car.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at t=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we probably want to move up as much as possible, but we have to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nFirst, let's see which freeways are dangerous at which times.\n\nSince we need min H, we should try to go directly up if possible.\n\ny=3 to y=9, difference is 6, so minimum H would be 6 if we can move up each turn, but we might need to wait or avoid.\n\nBut y=3 might have cars at t=4.\n\nPlayer is at y=3 at turn t=4, so we need to check if on freeway 3, there is a collision at t=4.\n\nFreeway 3 has cars: one car (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nAt t=4, span min = -47, max = -36? At t=4, for this car, min= τ = -47, max=h=-36, so span [-47,-36], which does not include 0, since -36 <0? -36 is negative, so min=-47, max=-36, both negative, so 0 not in [-47,-36], so no collision at t=4 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, we need to see when 0 is covered.\n\nBut for now, at t=4, player is on y=3, and no collision, so we can start.\n\nNow, we need to get to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D would go down, which is away from goal, so probably not useful, unless to avoid something, but since we want min turns, we should avoid going down if possible.\n\nS might be useful to wait.\n\nBut let's see the car movements.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is blocked, meaning that at that time, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but we only check at integer turns.\n\nSo for each row, find the set of T where min <=0<=max for some car.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nAt time T, min = -47 + 3(T-4)\n\nMax = -36 + 3(T-4)\n\nSet min <=0<= max\n\n-47 + 3(T-4) <= 0 <= -36 + 3(T-4)\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3(T-4) <= 0 => 3(T-4) <= 47 => T-4 <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so T <= 4 + 15.666 = 19.666, so T <=19 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 + 3(T-4) => 36 <= 3(T-4) => 12 <= T-4 => T >= 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, min <=0 and 0<=max.\n\nFrom above, T >=16 and T<=19.\n\nSo at T=16,17,18,19, freeway 1 is blocked.\n\nFreeway 2: same car parameters, (-36,-47,right,3), so same as freeway 1, blocked at T=16 to 19.\n\nFreeway 3: same, blocked T=16 to 19.\n\nNow freeway 4: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4)\n\nAt T, min = -43 + 4(T-4)\n\nMax = -32 + 4(T-4)\n\nSet min <=0<= max\n\n-43 +4(T-4) <=0 => 4(T-4) <=43 => T-4 <=10.75 => T<=14.75, so T<=14\n\nAnd 0<= -32 +4(T-4) => 32 <=4(T-4) => 8 <= T-4 => T>=12\n\nSo for this car, T from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nT>=12 and T<=14, so T=12,13,14.\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (4,-7,right,4) head=4, tail=-7\n\nAt T, min = -7 +4(T-4)\n\nMax = 4 +4(T-4)\n\nMin <=0<=max\n\n-7 +4(T-4) <=0 => 4(T-4) <=7 => T-4 <=1.75 => T<=5.75, so T<=5\n\n0 <= 4 +4(T-4) always true since min increases, but 0<= max: max=4+4(T-4), which for T>=4, T-4>=0, so max>=4>0, so 0<=max always true for T>=4.\n\nBut min<=0: -7 +4(T-4) <=0 => 4(T-4) <=7 => T-4 <=7/4=1.75 => T<=5.75, so T<=5.\n\nFor T=4, min=-7 +0 = -7 <=0, max=4>0, so 0 in [-7,4]? min=-7, max=4, so yes, 0 is between -7 and 4.\n\nAt T=5, min=-7+4(1)= -3? T-4=1, min=-7+4(1)= -3, max=4+4=8, so [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nT=6: min=-7+4(2)= -7+8=1, max=4+8=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min, not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly for higher T.\n\nSo for this car, blocked when min<=0, which is T<=5.\n\nT=4 and T=5.\n\nT=4: min=-7, max=4, yes.\n\nT=5: min=-3, max=8, yes.\n\nT=6: min=1, max=12, 0<1, not in.\n\nSo T=4 and 5.\n\nBut at T=4, we are at t=4, but player is on y=3, not on y=4, so for freeway 4, at T=4, it is blocked, but player is not on it yet.\n\nSimilarly, third car on freeway 4: (40,29,right,4) head=40, tail=29\n\nAt T, min=29 +4(T-4), max=40+4(T-4)\n\nMin=29 +4(τ) where τ=T-4\n\nFor τ>=0, min=29+4τ >=29>0, so min>0, so 0 < min <= max, so 0 not in [min,max] for any T.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 4, it is blocked when either first car or second car covers 0.\n\nFirst car covers T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car covers T=4,5\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 blocked at T=4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed 12\n\nAt T, min = -11 +12(T-4)\n\nMax = 0 +12(T-4) = 12(T-4)\n\nNow min <=0<=max\n\nmin <=0: -11 +12(T-4) <=0 => 12(T-4) <=11 => T-4 <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so T-4 <=0.916, since T integer, T-4 <=0, so T<=4\n\nBut T-4 >=0, so T-4=0, T=4\n\nAt T=4, min=-11 +0 = -11 <=0, max=0, so 0 in [-11,0]? max=0, min=-11, so 0 is included, since span [min,max] includes endpoints? The collision condition is 0 in span, and span is closed interval, I assume.\n\nIt says \"0 in Span(T)\", and span is [min,max], so if min <=0<=max, including equality.\n\nAt T=4, min=-11, max=0, so 0 <= max=0, so yes, 0 is in span.\n\nNow, 0<=max: max=12(T-4), at T=4, max=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nmin<=0 true.\n\nFor T>4, min = -11 +12(τ) with τ>=1, min >= -11+12=1>0, so min>0, 0 not in.\n\nAlso, for T=4, it is covered.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) min=37+12(τ), τ=T-4, min>=37>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only at T=4, it is blocked by the first car.\n\nAt T=4, min=-11, max=0, so x=0 is covered.\n\nNow, freeway 6: same as 5, (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12), so similarly, blocked only at T=4.\n\nFreeway 7: same, blocked T=4.\n\nFreeway 8: same, blocked T=4.\n\nNow, freeways 1,2,3 blocked at T=16-19, but that might be later.\n\nFreeway 4 blocked at T=4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 blocked only at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, player is on y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, freeway 3 is not blocked, as we saw earlier, since car at [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nBut freeways 5,6,7,8 are blocked at T=4, but player not on them.\n\nNow, we need to move from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe path: we need to go through y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nBut each of these may be blocked at certain times.\n\nSince we start at t=4, y=3.\n\nWe take actions from turn t=4 onwards.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose a_t, go to y_{T+1} = y_T + a_t.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T for y_T.\n\nFor example, at turn T=4, we are at y_4=3 (since position at start of turn).\n\nIn the notation, at turn t, position (0, y_t)\n\nSo at turn 4, y_4 =3.\n\nThen we choose a_4, then y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\nThen at turn 5, we are at y_5, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T: based on y_T and the cars on that row at time T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T_final.\n\nSince we move step by step, from y=3, to reach y=9, we need at least 6 up moves, but we might stay or move down, but that would increase turns, so min H=6 if we can go up directly.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up from t=4 to t=9, for example.\n\nt=4: y=3\n\nAfter action, y_5 = y_4 + a_4\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at turn, say, K, so at start of turn K, y_K=9.\n\nThen we stop after action at turn K-1, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the sequence.\n\nWe have turns from t=4 to t=4+H-1, with actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after H actions, we have y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=4.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter turn t, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn 4, start at y_4, take a_4, go to y_5.\n\nThen turn 5, start at y_5, take a_5, go to y_6, and so on, up to turn (4 + H -1), take a_{4+H-1}, go to y_{4+H}.\n\nThen we want y_{4+H} =9.\n\nAnd we have taken H actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn 4+H.\n\nBut at turn 4+H, we are at y_{4+H}, which should be 9.\n\nAnd collision must be avoided at each turn from t=4 to t=4+H-1, since at those turns, we are on some y_t, and must not collide.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t, and we take action, but collision is based on being on y_t at turn t.\n\nWhen we reach y_{4+H} =9, at turn 4+H, we are at y=9, which has no cars, so no collision, and we don't need to take action after that.\n\nSo we only need to avoid collision from turn t=4 to turn t=4+H-1, inclusive? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, for t from 4 to 4+H-1, we are on y_t, and we must not collide at that turn.\n\nThen at turn 4+H, we are on y_{4+H}=9, no issue.\n\nFor example, if H=1, we go from y_4 to y_5=9 in one action, but y_4=3, impossible to reach 9 in one step, since max change is +1.\n\nMin H: from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 steps up, so H >=6.\n\nIf we go up every turn, we reach in 6 turns: after 6 actions, y_{10} =3 +6=9.\n\nStart: turn 4, y_4=3\n\nAfter a_4: y_5 = y_4 + a_4, if a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nTurn 5, y_5=4, take a_5, etc.\n\nAfter k up moves, y_{4+k} =3+k\n\nSet 3+k=9, k=6, so after 6 up moves, at turn 10, y_10=9.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=9, that's 6 actions: a4 to a9, then y10=9.\n\nt from 4 to 9 inclusive is 6 turns.\n\nTurn 4: action a4, to y5\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: action a9, to y10\n\nSo H=6, y_{t1 + H} = y_{4+6} = y10=9.\n\nAnd we avoid collision at turns t=4 to t=9.\n\nNow, can we do this without collision?\n\nWe need to check for each turn T from 4 to 9, at y_T, whether it is blocked.\n\nBut y_T depends on our actions.\n\nIf we go straight up: at T=4, y_4=3, freeway 3, which is not blocked at T=4, as we saw.\n\nT=5: y_5=4 (if we went up at t=4), freeway 4.\n\nAt T=5, freeway 4: is it blocked?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 4 blocked at T=4,5,12,13,14.\n\nAt T=5, it is blocked.\n\nIf we are on y=4 at turn T=5, it is blocked.\n\nCollision would occur.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway 4 at turn 5.\n\nIf we go up at t=4, to y=4 at turn 5 start, but at turn T=5, we are on y_5=4, which is freeway 4, and at T=5, it is blocked, so collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot move up at t=4 to be on y=4 at t=5 when T=5.\n\nWe need to either not be on y=4 at T=5, or avoid that turn.\n\nBut T=5 is the only time we might be there if we move fast.\n\nWe could stay or move down to delay.\n\nBut we want min turns, so perhaps we can go up later.\n\nSince freeway 4 is blocked at T=5, but not at other times near, except T=4 and then T=12, etc.\n\nT=4 is now, but we are not on it.\n\nAt T=5, blocked.\n\nWhat about T=6? Freeway 4 not blocked at T=6, since blocked only at 4,5,12,13,14.\n\nT=6 to 11 should be free, except for other rows.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7,8 blocked only at T=4, so after that, they are free.\n\nFreeway 5 blocked only at T=4, similarly 6,7,8.\n\nAt T=4, they are blocked, but we are not on them.\n\nFor T>4, they are not blocked.\n\nExcept freeway 4 has blocks at T=12,13,14, but that might be later.\n\nNow, back to going up.\n\nIf we go up at t=4 to y=4, but at turn T=5, we would be on y=4, which is blocked, so collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go up at t=4.\n\nWe must not be on freeway 4 at turn T=5.\n\nOptions: at t=4, we could stay or move down.\n\nBut moving down to y=2 might not help, and we need to go up eventually.\n\nWe could stay at y=3 for one turn, then go up later.\n\nBut that increases turns.\n\nSince freeway 4 is only blocked at T=5, but at T=6 it is free, so if we can be on y=4 at T=6 instead of T=5.\n\nBut how?\n\nAt t=4, if we stay, then at turn 5, we are still at y=3.\n\nThen at t=5, we can go up to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nThen at turn T=6, we are on y=4, and freeway 4 is not blocked at T=6, since only blocked at 4,5,12,13,14.\n\nT=6 is fine.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nStart: turn 4, y_4=3\n\nAction a_4: if we stay, S, then y_5 = y_4 +0 =3\n\nThen turn 5, y_5=3, now at turn T=5, we are on y=3, freeway 3.\n\nIs freeway 3 blocked at T=5? Freeway 3 blocked at T=16-19, not at T=5, so safe.\n\nThen action a_5: U, then y_6 = y_5 +1 =3+1=4\n\nNow turn 6, y_6=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 4: not blocked, as above.\n\nThen a_6: U, y_7=5\n\nTurn 7, y_7=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt T=7, freeway 5: blocked only at T=4, so at T=7, not blocked, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_7: U, y_8=6\n\nTurn 8, y_8=6, freeway 6, not blocked (only at T=4), safe.\n\na_8: U, y_9=7\n\nTurn 9, y_9=7, freeway 7, not blocked, safe.\n\na_9: U, y_10=8\n\nTurn 10, y_10=8, freeway 8, not blocked, safe.\n\na_10: U, y_11=9\n\nNow at turn 11, y_11=9, which is the goal, and no cars, so we don't need to take action, but we have reached at turn 11.\n\nAfter a_10, we are at y_11=9.\n\nNow, we took actions from t=4 to t=10, that's 7 actions: a4 to a10.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nBut we started at t=4, ended at y_11=9 after 7 actions.\n\ny_{4+7} = y_11=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turns from 4 to 10 inclusive, 7 turns.\n\nBut earlier min was 6, but we had to wait one turn.\n\nCan we do with H=6?\n\nWith H=6, we would go from y_4=3 to y_10=9 in 6 actions.\n\nBut to do that, we need to go up every turn from t=4 to t=9.\n\nBut if we go up at t=4, to y_5=4, then at turn 5, y_5=4, which is blocked at T=5.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf we go up at t=4, but we cannot avoid being on y=4 at T=5 if we go up immediately.\n\nUnless we go to a different row.\n\nBut we have to go through the rows.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster or slower.\n\nBut we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: go down first to avoid, but that seems worse.\n\nFor example, at t=4, go down to y=2, then we might avoid some blocks, but y=2 is freeway 2, which is blocked only at T=16-19, not now.\n\nBut then we are lower, need more steps.\n\nFor instance: t=4, a4=D, y5=2\n\nThen turn 5, y5=2, freeway 2, not blocked (blocked at 16-19), safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, which is 7 steps up, so at least 7 actions, worse than previous 7 with one stay.\n\nIn previous with stay, we have 7 actions but reached at turn 11.\n\nWith down, we might reach later.\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some rows or something, but no, we have to move step by step.\n\nAnother possibility: at t=4, we stay, as before, but then at t=5, we go up, to be on y=4 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nThen we can go up each turn to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nBut from y=4 at T=6, to y=5 at T=7, etc., up to y=9.\n\ny_6=4 (at turn 6)\n\ny_7=5 (turn 7)\n\ny_8=6 (turn 8)\n\ny_9=7 (turn 9)\n\ny_10=8 (turn 10)\n\ny_11=9 (turn 11)\n\nAfter action at t=10, to y_11=9.\n\nWe need to take action until we reach.\n\nIn this case, from turn 4 to turn 10, 7 actions.\n\nTo reach in 6 actions, we need y_10=9.\n\ny_10 = y_4 + sum of Δy from t=4 to t=9.\n\ny_10 = y_4 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 + ... + Δy_9\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nTo have y_10=9, since y_4=3, we need sum of Δy from t=4 to t=9 to be +6.\n\nSince there are 6 actions (t=4 to t=9), each contributing to the change.\n\nThe position after k actions: after actions at t=4 to t=4+k-1, we are at y_{4+k}\n\nFor y_{10} =9, with y_4=3, so net +6 in 6 steps, so we must have exactly 6 up moves, no down or stay.\n\nThus, for H=6, we must go up every turn from t=4 to t=9.\n\nThen the path is fixed: y_5=4, y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9.\n\nNow, check collision at each turn:\n\nTurn T=4: y_4=3, freeway 3, not blocked (as before), safe.\n\nTurn T=5: y_5=4, freeway 4, and at T=5, it is blocked (from earlier), so collision! Not safe.\n\nTherefore, impossible with H=6.\n\nWe must have at least one non-up move to avoid being on y=4 at T=5.\n\nIn the sequence with one stay, we have H=7.\n\nBut perhaps we can stay at a different point.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at t=4, we could go up later, but we have to be on y=4 at some turn not 5.\n\nIn the direct up, we are forced to be on y=4 at T=5.\n\nWe can only be on y=4 at other times, like T=6 or later.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at T=6, we need to arrive at y=4 at turn 6.\n\nThat means, at turn 5, we should be at y=3 or y=5? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nTo be at y=4 at turn T=6, that means at start of turn 6, y_6=4.\n\ny_6 depends on previous actions.\n\ny_6 = y_5 + a_5 action.\n\ny_5 is position at turn 5.\n\nIf y_5=3, and we do U, then y_6=4.\n\nIf y_5=4, and we do S, y_6=4.\n\nIf y_5=5, and we do D, y_6=4.\n\nBut in our case, we want to minimize turns, so probably the first option is best.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=4 at T=6, we can have, for example:\n\n- At turn 5, y_5=3, then a_5=U, to y_6=4.\n\n- Or at turn 5, y_5=4, a_5=S, to y_6=4.\n\nBut if y_5=4, at turn T=5, we are on y=4, which is blocked, so we cannot have y_5=4 at T=5.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have y_6=4 is to have y_5=3 and a_5=U.\n\nThen at turn 6, y_6=4, which is safe for T=6.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up from there.\n\nBut we need to start from t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y_4=3.\n\nIf we do S at t=4, then y_5=3.\n\nThen at turn 5, y_5=3, safe (freeway 3 not blocked).\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=4.\n\nTurn 6, y_6=4, safe (T=6 not blocked).\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nTurn 7, y_7=5, freeway 5, not blocked (only T=4 blocked), safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nTurn 8, y_8=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nTurn 9, y_9=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nTurn 10, y_10=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nNow y_11=9, reached.\n\nWe have actions from t=4 to t=10, 7 actions.\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, we take actions until t=10, and position at t=11 is 9.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut we could reduce if we can go faster later.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at T=6, we go up to y=5 at T=7, etc., but each step takes one turn.\n\nWe cannot skip.\n\nAnother thing: freeways 5-8 are only blocked at T=4, so after that, they are always safe.\n\nFreeway 4 is blocked at T=12,13,14, but we are passing at T=6, which is before, so fine.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3 blocked at T=16-19, but we are above by then.\n\nIn this path, we are not going to lower rows.\n\nNow, can we start by going up at t=4 but to a different row? No.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=4 at an earlier time, but T=4 is blocked, T=5 blocked, T=6 is earliest possible after waiting.\n\nT=6 is the first safe time for freeway 4.\n\nThen we proceed.\n\nBut we used one stay.\n\nIs there a way with H=6? We saw it's impossible because must be on y=4 at T=5 if going direct.\n\nUnless we go through a different path, but we have to go through y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nWe could go down to y=2 or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go down to y=2 at some point, but then need to come back, increasing steps.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=4, go down to y=2.\n\nThen y_5=2\n\nTurn 5, y_5=2, freeway 2, not blocked, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, go up to y=3\n\ny_6=3\n\nTurn 6, y_6=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nThen t=6, go up to y=4\n\ny_7=4\n\nTurn 7, y_7=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=7, freeway 4: not blocked (blocked only at 4,5,12,13,14), T=7 is fine.\n\nThen continue up: t=7, U, y_8=5\n\nTurn 8, y_8=5, safe\n\nt=8, U, y_9=6\n\nTurn 9, y_9=6, safe\n\nt=9, U, y_10=7\n\nTurn 10, y_10=7, safe\n\nt=10, U, y_11=8\n\nTurn 11, y_11=8, safe\n\nt=11, U, y_12=9\n\nNow reached at y_12, with actions from t=4 to t=11, 8 actions, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the first plan with one stay is better.\n\nBut in the first plan, we have 7 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go up immediately but skip freeway 4 or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 4 is safe at T=6, and we can be there.\n\nBut to minimize, we need to see if we can reach faster by going to higher rows earlier.\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=5 or higher at earlier turns, but we start from y=3.\n\nSuppose at t=4, we go up to y=4, but we collide at T=5, so we cannot.\n\nUnless we are not on y=4 at T=5, but if we go up at t=4, we are on y=4 at T=5.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps at t=4, we go up, but then at t=5, we move away quickly, but collision is checked at each turn separately.\n\nAt turn T=5, if we are on y=4, and it is blocked, we collide, regardless of action.\n\nSo we must avoid being on a blocked freeway at that turn.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 4 at T=5.\n\nThe only way is to delay being on freeway 4 until T=6 or later.\n\nThus, we need to have a turn where we don't go up, or go down, but going down increases time.\n\nSo minimal is to stay once, with H=7.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nt1=4\n\nWe need to output actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nIn this case H=7, so actions a4 to a10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: at y=3, do S (stay), so y5=3\n\nTurn 5: at y=3, do U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6: at y=4, do U, y7=5\n\nTurn 7: at y=5, do U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8: at y=6, do U, y9=7\n\nTurn 9: at y=7, do U, y10=8\n\nTurn 10: at y=8, do U, y11=9\n\nNow, we reached y11=9 after turn 10 action.\n\nNow, check collision at each turn:\n\nTurn 4: y=3, freeway 3, not blocked, safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=3, freeway 3, not blocked (blocked only 16-19), safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=4, freeway 4, at T=6, not blocked (blocked at 4,5,12,13,14), safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=5, freeway 5, at T=7, not blocked (only T=4), safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=6, freeway 6, not blocked, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, freeway 7, not blocked, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, freeway 8, not blocked, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6? We thought no, but let's confirm.\n\nSuppose we try to be on y=4 at T=6, but with H=6, we need to reach by turn 10, y10=9.\n\nWith 6 actions, we must go up each time from t=4 to t=9.\n\ny5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nThen at turn 5: y=4, T=5, blocked, collision.\n\nIf we do something else, but with H=6, we must have all U, so no choice.\n\nTherefore, H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps we can start by going up at t=4, but then at t=5, we go down or something, but that would not help reaching faster.\n\nFor example, t=4: U, y5=4 → at turn 5, y=4, blocked, collision. Cannot.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nNow, the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 4, it is blocked at T=12,13,14, but we are not there at that time, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, other blocks are later.\n\nIn this sequence, we have one stay at the beginning.\n\nWe could stay later, but it might not reduce H.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up at t=4 to y=4, but we collide at T=5, so we cannot.\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nAt t=4, we could go down, but worse.\n\nSo the sequence is fixed.\n\nIn the output, we need to write the actions for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn terms of the turn indices: from t=4 to t=10.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is a4)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}  (a5)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nH=7, so t_1 + H-1 = 4 + 6 =10? Let's see.\n\nt_1 =4\n\nActions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nFor H=7, actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThat is, from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1 + H-1 =4 +7-1=10, yes.\n\nThen the turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, we go from y=8 to y=9, which is fine.\n\nNow, but in the freeways, freeway 8 is not blocked at T=10, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if we go up, but cannot.\n\nAnother thought: at t=4, we go up, but since freeway 4 is blocked at T=5, but if we could be on y=4 at a different time, but in the direct path, no.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=5 directly or something, but we cannot, only move one step.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if we can be on y=4 at T=6 with fewer delays.\n\nFor example, if we start from lower, but we start from y=3.\n\nSuppose at t=4, we go down to y=2, then at t=5, go to y=3, then t=6 go to y=4, but then we are at y=4 at T=6, same as before, but we took an extra down and up, so more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nThus, the sequence with one initial stay is optimal.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions clearly.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5,6,7,8, they have cars, but only blocked at T=4, so after that, no issue.\n\nIn our sequence, we pass them at T=7,8,9,10, all after T=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 at T=6, safe.\n\nNow, the car on freeway 5 at T=4: (0,-11,right,12), at T=4, min=-11, max=0, so covers x=0.\n\nBut at T=5, min=-11+12=1, max=12, not cover.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nSequence of actions.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal with \\(H = 7\\) turns.\n\nThe analysis shows that moving directly upward from turn 4 would result in a collision on freeway 4 at turn 5, as freeway 4 is blocked at turns 4, 5, 12, 13, and 14. Specifically, at turn 5, if the player is on freeway 4, a collision occurs due to the car spans covering position \\(x = 0\\). Therefore, an initial stay action (S) is required at turn 4 to avoid this collision, delaying the upward movement.\n\nThe sequence ensures that:\n- At turn 4, the player stays at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3), which is safe as freeway 3 is not blocked at turn 4.\n- At turn 5, the player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4), but this occurs at turn 6 (since the position updates after the action), and freeway 4 is not blocked at turn 6.\n- From turns 6 to 10, the player moves upward each turn, reaching freeways 5 to 8 at turns 7 to 10, respectively. Freeways 5 to 8 are only blocked at turn 4, so they are safe at turns 7 to 10.\n- After the action at turn 10, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, which is safe as there are no cars on \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 7 turns, which is minimal, as \\(H = 6\\) is impossible due to the collision on freeway 4 at turn 5 if moving upward immediately.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t=14 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The cars are defined at turn t=14, and I need to find their positions at future turns. The position update is given, and since they're moving at constant speed, I can compute their span at any turn T > 14.\n\nFor a left-moving car: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor a right-moving car: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Head and tail might be confusing. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\". And for right-moving, span is [τ, h]? No, let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: initial span [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: initial span [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]? But in the description, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? No.\n\nLook:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, span is from τ to h, with τ < h I assume, since it's moving right.\n\nIn the car state, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nh = -48, τ = -59? But -48 is greater than -59, so if direction is right, span is from τ to h, so from -59 to -48? But that would be [τ, h] = [-59, -48], and since it's moving right, at T, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h > τ, moving left.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except... let's see the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) so h=-48, τ=-59, direction right. Since τ=-59 < h=-48, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at turn T, span is [ -59 + 3*(T-14), -48 + 3*(T-14) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, freeway 4 has three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\n(24,13,right,4): h=24, τ=13, so span [13,24] at t1.\n\nBut 13 to 24, and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, (24,13) — τ=13, h=24, so [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\n(0,-11,right,12): h=0, τ=-11, so span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t1.\n\nAnd moving right with speed 12.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, when I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new row at turn T, I am not considered on that row until the next turn, so at turn T, after action, I am on y_{T}, and I check collision for row y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut at turn T, after action, position is y_{T}, so if I move, y_T = y_{T-1} + delta, and I am on row y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note clarifies that when I am on row y at turn T, I only care about cars on row y at turn T, not about future or past positions. And since the row changes only after the move, at the instant of turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nSo, for each turn, when I am on a freeway row (1-8), I need that for that row, at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nFor rows 0 and 9, I assume there are no cars, since freeways are from 1 to 8. The player starts at (0,0), which is row 0, and goal is (0,9), row 9, both should be safe, no cars.\n\nRow 0 and row 9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so I need to cross rows 1 to 8.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0, but y must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at 0 and need to reach 9, and rows are small, probably I need to go up, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nBut since cars are moving, I need to time my crossing so that when I am on a row, no car is at x=0.\n\nAlso, since I can only change by -1,0,+1 per turn, and y from 0 to 9, min steps to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or detour if there are cars blocking.\n\nNow, let me first list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nSet t1 = 14.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with their span at t=14.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, when position x=0 is covered by a car at turn T.\n\nThat is, for each car, find the times when 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nSince the span moves with constant speed, I can find the time intervals when 0 is covered.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s(T-14), h + s(T-14)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-14) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-14)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nAll directions are \"right\", so all cars are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: each has one car: (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\n(24,13,right,4): h=24, τ=13, so span [13,24] at t=14, moving right.\n\nBut 13 to 24, at t=14, and moving right at speed 4, so at T, span [13 + 4(T-14), 24 + 4(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7,8: each has two cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst, let's handle freeways 1,2,3 since they are similar.\n\nFreeway k=1,2,3: car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=3, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-14), h + s(T-14)] = [-59 + 3(T-14), -48 + 3(T-14)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3(T-14) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3(T-14)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3(T-14) ≤ 0 ⇒ 3(T-14) ≤ 59 ⇒ T-14 ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so T ≤ 14 + 19.666 = 33.666, so T ≤ 33 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 3(T-14) ⇒ 48 ≤ 3(T-14) ⇒ 16 ≤ T-14 ⇒ T ≥ 30\n\nSo for T from 30 to 33 inclusive.\n\n-48 + 3(T-14) ≥ 0 ⇒ 3(T-14) ≥ 48 ⇒ T-14 ≥ 16 ⇒ T ≥ 30\n\nAnd -59 + 3(T-14) ≤ 0 ⇒ 3(T-14) ≤ 59 ⇒ T-14 ≤ 19.666, T ≤ 33.666, so T ≤ 33\n\nThus for T=30,31,32,33, 0 is covered on freeways 1,2,3.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 4(T-14), -48 + 4(T-14)]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 4(T-14) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4(T-14)\n\nFirst: -59 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 4ΔT ≤ 59 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 14.75, T ≤ 14 + 14.75 = 28.75, T ≤ 28\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 4ΔT ⇒ 48 ≤ 4ΔT ⇒ 12 ≤ ΔT ⇒ T ≥ 26\n\nSo for T=26,27,28\n\nΔT = T-14\n\nT ≥ 14 + 12 = 26\n\nT ≤ 14 + 14.75, but 59/4=14.75, so T ≤ 28.75, T ≤ 28\n\nNow second car on freeway 4: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nh=-12, τ=-23\n\nSpan at T: [-23 + 4(T-14), -12 + 4(T-14)]\n\n0 in span: -23 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 4ΔT\n\nFirst: -23 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 4ΔT ≤ 23 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 5.75, T ≤ 19.75, T ≤ 19\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 + 4ΔT ⇒ 12 ≤ 4ΔT ⇒ 3 ≤ ΔT ⇒ T ≥ 17\n\nSo T=17,18,19\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (24,13,right,4) — h=24, τ=13\n\nSpan at T: [13 + 4(T-14), 24 + 4(T-14)]\n\n0 in span: 13 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 13 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 4ΔT ≤ -13 ⇒ ΔT ≤ -3.25, which is impossible since ΔT ≥ 0.\n\n13 + 4ΔT is always positive for ΔT ≥ 0, so 13 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 is never true. Thus 0 is never in span for this car, since the car is at x=13 to 24 at t=14 and moving right, so x increases, min x is 13, so 0 is never covered.\n\nSimilarly, for all future T, the left end is 13 + 4ΔT > 0, so no issue.\n\nThus on freeway 4, 0 is covered when first car or second car covers it.\n\nFirst car covers T=26,27,28\n\nSecond car covers T=17,18,19\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 has 0 covered at T=17,18,19,26,27,28\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 12(T-14), -48 + 12(T-14)]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 59 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, T ≤ 18.916, T ≤ 18\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT ⇒ 48 ≤ 12ΔT ⇒ 4 ≤ ΔT ⇒ T ≥ 18\n\nT ≥ 18 and T ≤ 18, so only T=18\n\nΔT ≥ 4 and ΔT ≤ 4.916, so ΔT=4, since integer, T=14+4=18\n\nNow second car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nh=0, τ=-11\n\nSpan at T: [-11 + 12(T-14), 0 + 12(T-14)] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 always true for ΔT ≥ 1? -11 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so for ΔT=0, T=14\n\nBut T is turn, at T=14, we are given the state, but we start at t=14, and we are at position (0,0), which is row 0, not on freeway, so for row k, we care when we are on it.\n\nAt turn T, for freeway row, we check collision.\n\nFor this car, at T=14, span is [-11,0], so 0 is included, but at T=14, if I were on row 5, I would collide, but at t=14, I am on row 0, not row 5, so it's ok.\n\nBut for future turns.\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 12ΔT is always true for ΔT ≥ 0, since 12ΔT ≥ 0.\n\nAnd -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so only for ΔT=0, T=14.\n\nFor T>14, ΔT ≥1, 12ΔT ≥12 >11, so -11+12ΔT >0, so 0 is not ≤ -11+12ΔT? Let's see.\n\nThe inequality is -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nLeft part: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/12\n\nRight part: 0 ≤ 12ΔT, always true for ΔT ≥ 0.\n\nBut for ΔT=0, -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ 0 is true, but -11 ≤ 0 is true, and 0 ≤ 0, but the span at T=14 is [-11,0], so x=0 is included.\n\nFor ΔT=1, T=15, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly for later, always positive, so only at T=14, 0 is covered for this car.\n\nBut at T=14, we are not on row 5, so for freeway 5, at T=14, if we were on row 5, collision, but we are not.\n\nFor future, only the first car covers at T=18, as above.\n\nFirst car covers only T=18.\n\nSecond car only T=14.\n\nSo for freeway 5, 0 is covered at T=14 and T=18.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, each has the same cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSo same as freeway 5: 0 covered at T=14 and T=18 for each.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when 0 is covered (unsafe times):\n\nFreeway 1: T=30,31,32,33\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=30,31,32,33\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=30,31,32,33\n\nFreeway 4: T=17,18,19,26,27,28\n\nFreeway 5: T=14,18\n\nFreeway 6: T=14,18\n\nFreeway 7: T=14,18\n\nFreeway 8: T=14,18\n\nNote that at T=14, we are at row 0, so for rows 1-8, we don't care about T=14 yet.\n\nI need to start from t=14, position y=0.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, which changes y to y+1, y-1, or y.\n\nThen I move to new y, and at that turn, if y is between 1 and 8, I must not have 0 covered on that row at that turn.\n\nThen I continue.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe unsafe times for each row:\n\nLet me list for each row, the set of turns when it is unsafe to be there.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=30,31,32,33\n\nRow 2: same, T=30,31,32,33\n\nRow 3: same, T=30,31,32,33\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=17,18,19,26,27,28\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=14,18 — but T=14 is now, and we are not on row 5, so for future, T=18 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: unsafe T=14,18 → only T=18 for future\n\nRow 7: same, T=18\n\nRow 8: same, T=18\n\nNow, T=18 is unsafe for rows 5,6,7,8 and also row 4 at T=18.\n\nRow 4 unsafe at T=17,18,19,26,27,28\n\nRow 5-8 unsafe only at T=18? Row 5 unsafe at T=14 and T=18, but T=14 past, so only T=18.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nBut row 5-8 are unsafe only at T=18? Let me confirm.\n\nFor row 5, cars: at T=14 unsafe, but that's past. At T=18, unsafe because first car covers it? Earlier for freeway 5, first car covers only T=18, second car only T=14.\n\nSo yes, row 5 unsafe only at T=18 for T>14.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nBut row 4 unsafe at multiple times.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nMin steps: if no cars, I could go up 9 times in 9 turns: at turn t=14, I start, after first action at t=14, I move to some y.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y_T.\n\nThe action is taken at turn T, and the new position is for the next turn? Let's see the dynamics.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nAnd Delta y_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision: \"at turn T, if you are on freeway y_T, and 0 in span for that row at turn T.\"\n\nSo when I am at turn T, position y_T, I need that if y_T between 1 and 8, then for that row, at turn T, no car has 0 in span.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn T, given y_T, it must be safe if on freeway.\n\nNow, start at t=14, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say H, so at turn H, y_H =9, which is safe.\n\nThe actions from t=14 to t=14+H-1 or something.\n\nLet me set the turns.\n\nStart: turn 14, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_14, y_15 = y_14 + delta y_14\n\nGenerally, at turn t, after action, y_{t} is the position for that turn.\n\nAt turn 14, before any action, position is (0,0). Then I take action a_14, which moves me to y_15? No.\n\nAccording to update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I take a_t, then y_{t+1} is new position.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, it says \"at turn T\", so I think when we say at turn T, position is y_T, and we check collision based on that.\n\nIn the note, it says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nFor example, at turn T, you are on y_T. You take action a_T, which may change y, so at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, you are on row y_T, and you check for row y_T at time T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, you are on row y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nNow, in this case, start at turn 14, y=0.\n\nI need to have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, I reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at turn 14, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 14, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_14, at turn 15, y= y_14 + delta y_14, but y_14=0, so y_15 = delta y_14.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, I am at turn 14 + k.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t.\n\nI start at t=14, y_14=0.\n\nI need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=14 to t=14+H-1 for H actions, so that at turn 14+H, y_{14+H}=9.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn, at turn 14, y=0, take a_14=U, then y_15=1\n\na_15=U, y_16=2\n\n...\n\nafter 9 actions: a_14 to a_22, y_23=9.\n\nAt turn 23, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I may need more turns.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are for T >=14.\n\nList for each row the unsafe turns:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=30,31,32,33\n\nBut these are late, and since I start at t=14, I can cross early.\n\nSimilarly row 2 and 3 same.\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=17,18,19,26,27,28\n\nT=17,18,19 are soon, T=26-28 later.\n\nRow 5: unsafe only at T=18\n\nSimilarly row 6,7,8: unsafe only at T=18\n\nT=18 is critical for rows 5-8 and also row 4.\n\nNow, since row 5-8 are unsafe only at T=18, and safe at other times, I can cross them when safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 1-3 unsafe only late, so I can cross early.\n\nBut row 4 has multiple unsafe periods.\n\nI need to plan the path.\n\nSince I need to go up, and rows 5-8 are blocked only at T=18, I should avoid being on rows 5,6,7,8 at turn T=18.\n\nSimilarly, for row 4, avoid at T=17,18,19,26,27,28.\n\nBut T=17,18,19 are early, T=26-28 later.\n\nI start at t=14, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal time might be less than 18, but let's see.\n\nFirst, if I go directly up:\n\nStart t=14, y=0\n\na_14=U, then y_15=1\n\nAt t=15, y=1, row 1. Is row 1 safe at t=15? Row 1 unsafe only at 30-33, so safe at t=15.\n\na_15=U, y_16=2, row 2 safe.\n\na_16=U, y_17=3, row 3 safe.\n\na_17=U, y_18=4, row 4.\n\nNow at t=18, y=4, row 4 is unsafe at T=17,18,19? Yes, T=18 is unsafe for row 4.\n\nSo if I am on row 4 at t=18, collision.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=18, I am on row 4, which is unsafe, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could wait or go down.\n\nSince row 4 is also unsafe at t=17 and t=19.\n\nt=17,18,19 unsafe for row 4.\n\nIn the above, at t=17, if I were on row 4, but in the sequence above, at t=17, I am on row 3 if I go up.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nt=14: y=0 (safe)\n\na_14=U, y_15=1 (row 1, safe since t=15 not 30-33)\n\na_15=U, y_16=2 (row 2, safe)\n\na_16=U, y_17=3 (row 3, safe)\n\na_17=U, y_18=4 (row 4, but t=18 unsafe for row 4)\n\nCollision.\n\nTo avoid, I could not go to row 4 at t=18.\n\nI could go slower or faster.\n\nFor example, if I stay at row 3 for one turn.\n\nStart: t=14, y=0\n\na_14=S, then y_15=0? a_14=S, delta y=0, so y_15=0+0=0\n\nBut I am at y=0, which is safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen a_15=U, y_16=1\n\na_16=U, y_17=2\n\na_17=U, y_18=3 (row 3, safe)\n\nThen at t=18, y=3, row 3 is safe, since row 3 unsafe only at 30-33.\n\nThen a_18=U, y_19=4 (row 4)\n\nAt t=19, row 4 is unsafe? T=19 unsafe for row 4.\n\nSo collision at t=19.\n\nIf I go faster, but I start from 0, at t=14, I can only go to y=1 at t=15, so I cannot be at row 4 earlier than t=17? Let's see min time to reach row 4.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=14.\n\nAfter 1 action: t=15, y=1\n\n2 actions: t=16, y=2\n\n3 actions: t=17, y=3\n\n4 actions: t=18, y=4\n\nSo I can be at row 4 at earliest t=18, with y_18=4.\n\nBut t=18 unsafe for row 4.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to row 4 at t=19, y_19=4, but t=19 unsafe.\n\nt=20: if I reach later.\n\nBut row 4 also unsafe at t=26,27,28, but that's late.\n\nI could cross row 4 before t=17 or after t=19 but before t=26 or after t=28.\n\nt=17,18,19 unsafe, so safe for row 4 at t=15,16? t=15: row 4 not reached yet.\n\nAt t=15, I can be at most y=1 or 0.\n\nSimilarly t=16, y=2 max.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 4 before t=17? At t=17, I can be y=3 if I go up, or y=4 if I go faster, but I cannot, since from t=14 y=0, at t=15 y=1, t=16 y=2, t=17 y=3, so earliest to be on row 4 is t=18 with y=4.\n\nAt t=18 y=4.\n\nBut t=18 unsafe.\n\nAt t=19 y=4, unsafe.\n\nAt t=20 y=4, but t=20, is row 4 safe? Unsafe at 17,18,19,26,27,28, so t=20 safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, t=21 to 25 safe, t=26-28 unsafe, t=29+ safe.\n\nSo I can be on row 4 at t=20, for example.\n\nBut to reach row 4 at t=20, I need to be at lower rows earlier.\n\nNow, also, rows 5-8 have issue at t=18 only.\n\nFirst, let's plan to avoid row 4 during unsafe times.\n\nSince row 4 is unsafe at t=17,18,19, I should not be on row 4 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 5-8, not at t=18.\n\nNow, I start from bottom.\n\nI need to cross rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nRows 1,2,3 are safe except late, so I can cross early.\n\nRow 4 has early unsafe and late unsafe, but I can cross during safe period, e.g. t=20 to 25.\n\nRows 5-8 safe except t=18, so I can cross at t<18 or t>18.\n\nt=18 is the critical point.\n\nSince I start at t=14, t=18 is only 4 turns later.\n\nIn 4 turns, from y=0, I can reach at most y=4.\n\nt=14: y=0\n\nt=15: y=1 if U\n\nt=16: y=2\n\nt=17: y=3\n\nt=18: y=4 if U\n\nBut y=4 at t=18 is row 4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go slower, I might be at lower row.\n\nBut rows 5-8: to be on them at t<18, I need to reach them before t=18.\n\nFor example, to be on row 5 at t=17, I need y=5 at t=17.\n\nBut from t=14 y=0, at t=15 y=1, t=16 y=2, t=17 y=3, so y=3 at t=17, cannot be at row 5 before t=18? Earliest to row 5 is t=19 with y=5.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at earliest t=22 with y=8.\n\nLet's list the earliest possible time to reach each row.\n\nStart t=14 y=0\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=14+k, y can be from 0 to min(9,k)\n\nBut since we go up, y <= k after k up actions.\n\nEarliest to reach row y is at turn 14 + y.\n\nFor row 1: at turn 15 (if U at t=14)\n\nRow 2: turn 16\n\nRow 3: turn 17\n\nRow 4: turn 18\n\nRow 5: turn 19\n\nRow 6: turn 20\n\nRow 7: turn 21\n\nRow 8: turn 22\n\nRow 9: turn 23\n\nNow, for row 4, unsafe at t=17,18,19 — but t=17 I cannot be on row 4, earliest is t=18, which is unsafe.\n\nt=19 also unsafe, t=20 safe.\n\nSo I can be on row 4 at t=20 or later, except 26-28.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5, unsafe at t=18, but I cannot be on row 5 at t=18, earliest t=19, which is safe for row 5? Row 5 unsafe only at t=18, so at t=19 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 6,7,8, unsafe only at t=18, so at t=19 or later, safe.\n\nNow, row 4 at t=18 and t=19 unsafe, so I need to be on row 4 at t=20 or later.\n\nBut at t=20, I can be on row 4.\n\nSimilarly, I can proceed to higher rows.\n\nNow, the issue is to coordinate.\n\nAlso, I need to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are safe except t=18, and I cannot be there at t=18 anyway, no problem.\n\nRow 4 is the bottleneck.\n\nI need to delay reaching row 4 until t=20 at least.\n\nCurrently, if I go up, I reach row 4 at t=18, which is bad.\n\nSo I need to slow down before row 4.\n\nFor example, stay at row 3 for one turn.\n\nStart:\n\nt=14: y=0, safe\n\na_14: let's choose action.\n\nIf a_14=U, y_15=1 (row 1 safe)\n\na_15=U, y_16=2 (row 2 safe)\n\na_16=U, y_17=3 (row 3 safe)\n\nNow at t=17, y=3, I need to not go up to avoid row 4 at t=18.\n\nSo at t=17, I can do S or D.\n\nIf S, y_18=3, still row 3, safe.\n\nThen at t=18, y=3, row 3 safe.\n\nNow I can go up.\n\na_18=U, y_19=4 (row 4)\n\nBut at t=19, row 4 is unsafe, since T=19 unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=17, I go down? a_17=D, y_18=2 (row 2, safe)\n\nThen a_18=U, y_19=3 (row 3)\n\na_19=U, y_20=4 (row 4)\n\nAt t=20, row 4 is safe (since unsafe only 17,18,19,26-28)\n\nThen I can go up.\n\na_20=U, y_21=5 (row 5)\n\nAt t=21, row 5: unsafe only t=18, so safe.\n\na_21=U, y_22=6 (row 6 safe)\n\na_22=U, y_23=7 (row 7 safe)\n\na_23=U, y_24=8 (row 8 safe)\n\na_24=U, y_25=9, reached.\n\nBut at y=9, row 9 safe.\n\nNow, turns: from t=14 to t=25, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=14 to t=24, actions a_14 to a_24, that's 11 actions? Turns: start t=14, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action at t=14, to t=15.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 14+k.\n\nAt turn 14, y=0.\n\nAfter a_14, t=15, y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_24, t=25, y=9.\n\nSo actions from a_14 to a_24, 11 actions.\n\nBut I reached at t=25.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have:\n\nt=14: y=0, a_14=U? In my plan, I need to slow down.\n\nIn the sequence I thought:\n\nt=14: y=0, a_14=U? Let's list actions step by step.\n\nStart: t=14, y=0\n\nI take a_14, which affects y_15.\n\nTo reach row 4 at t=20.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=14: y=0, take a_14=U, then y_15=1\n\nt=15: y=1, take a_15=U, y_16=2\n\nt=16: y=2, take a_16=U, y_17=3\n\nt=17: y=3, now I need to not go up immediately. If I take a_17=S, then y_18=3\n\nt=18: y=3, take a_18=U, y_19=4\n\nBut at t=19, y=4, row 4 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=17, take a_17=D, then y_18=2\n\nt=18: y=2, take a_18=U, y_19=3\n\nt=19: y=3, take a_19=U, y_20=4\n\nt=20: y=4, row 4 safe (t=20 not unsafe)\n\nThen a_20=U, y_21=5\n\nt=21: y=5, row 5 safe (t=21 ≠18)\n\na_21=U, y_22=6\n\nt=22: y=6, row 6 safe\n\na_22=U, y_23=7\n\nt=23: y=7, row 7 safe\n\na_23=U, y_24=8\n\nt=24: y=8, row 8 safe\n\na_24=U, y_25=9\n\nt=25: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, actions: a_14 to a_24, that's 11 actions: turns t=14 to t=24 for actions.\n\nSequence: a_14=U, a_15=U, a_16=U, a_17=D, a_18=U, a_19=U, a_20=U, a_21=U, a_22=U, a_23=U, a_24=U\n\nIn terms of turn: Turn t_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1, but t_1=14.\n\nIn answer, it should be Turn 14: a_{14}, Turn 15: a_{15}, etc.\n\nNow, is this minimal? I used a down action, which added one extra turn.\n\nCan I do with fewer?\n\nFor example, instead of going down, can I stay or something.\n\nBut if I stay at row 3 for two turns.\n\nt=14: y=0, a_14=U, y_15=1\n\nt=15: y=1, a_15=U, y_16=2\n\nt=16: y=2, a_16=U, y_17=3\n\nt=17: y=3, a_17=S, y_18=3\n\nt=18: y=3, a_18=S, y_19=3? Still row 3.\n\nThen a_19=U, y_20=4\n\nt=20: y=4, row 4 safe\n\nThen go up: a_20=U, y_21=5\n\na_21=U, y_22=6\n\na_22=U, y_23=7\n\na_23=U, y_24=8\n\na_24=U, y_25=9\n\nSame as before, but I used S instead of D, but still 11 actions to reach at t=25.\n\nIn this case, actions: a_14=U, a_15=U, a_16=U, a_17=S, a_18=S, a_19=U, a_20=U, ..., up to a_24=U\n\na_19=U to y_20=4, then a_20=U to y_21=5, etc., up to a_24=U to y_25=9.\n\nSo actions from a_14 to a_24, 11 actions.\n\nBut in the first with down, also 11 actions.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 4 at t=20, but start from t=14.\n\nMin time to y=4 is t=18, but unsafe.\n\nt=19 unsafe, t=20 safe.\n\nSo I cannot reach row 4 before t=18, and t=18,19 unsafe, so t=20 is earliest possible to be on row 4.\n\nThen from there, to row 9, need 5 more up actions, so at t=25.\n\nThus minimal time to reach is t=25, with 11 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to spend extra turns at lower rows.\n\nIn the down version, I went down to y=2 at t=18, then up.\n\nIn the stay version, I stayed at y=3 for two turns.\n\nBoth take same time.\n\nBut perhaps I can go up faster later, but no, I need to go from 4 to 9, 5 steps.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are safe except t=18, and I can be on them at t=19 or later, no issue.\n\nBut row 4 must be at t=20 or later.\n\nt=20 is fine.\n\nBut what about later unsafe times? t=26-28 for row 4, but since I cross early, no problem.\n\nIn the sequence, I reach row 4 at t=20, then go up to row 5 at t=21, etc., all before t=26, so safe.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, I need to specify.\n\nBut let me confirm the collisions.\n\nIn the sequence with down:\n\nt=14: y=0, safe\n\na_14=U, y_15=1, row 1 at t=15: safe (not 30-33)\n\na_15=U, y_16=2, row 2 at t=16: safe\n\na_16=U, y_17=3, row 3 at t=17: safe (row 3 unsafe only 30-33)\n\na_17=D, y_18=2, row 2 at t=18: row 2 unsafe only at 30-33, t=18 safe.\n\na_18=U, y_19=3, row 3 at t=19: safe\n\na_19=U, y_20=4, row 4 at t=20: row 4 unsafe at 17,18,19,26,27,28; t=20 not in, so safe.\n\na_20=U, y_21=5, row 5 at t=21: row 5 unsafe only t=18, so safe.\n\na_21=U, y_22=6, row 6 at t=22: safe (only unsafe t=18)\n\na_22=U, y_23=7, row 7 at t=23: safe\n\na_23=U, y_24=8, row 8 at t=24: safe\n\na_24=U, y_25=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nWith stay:\n\nt=14: y=0, a_14=U, y_15=1\n\nt=15: y=1, a_15=U, y_16=2\n\nt=16: y=2, a_16=U, y_17=3\n\nt=17: y=3, a_17=S, y_18=3\n\nt=18: y=3, a_18=S, y_19=3? a_18=S, y_19=3\n\nThen t=19: y=3, a_19=U, y_20=4\n\nt=20: y=4, row 4 safe\n\nThen same as before, a_20=U, y_21=5, etc.\n\nBut at t=19, I am still at y=3, which is fine, but I reach y=4 later? In this case, at t=20 y=4, same as before.\n\nBut in the stay version, I stayed at y=3 for two turns (t=17 and t=18), then at t=19 I go to y=4? No:\n\nt=17: y=3, a_17=S, y_18=3\n\nt=18: y=3, a_18=S, y_19=3\n\nt=19: y=3, a_19=U, y_20=4\n\nSo I reach y=4 at t=20, same as down version.\n\nBut in down version, I reached y=4 at t=20 with one down action, here with two stay actions, but same time.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, both have 11 actions to reach at t=25.\n\nBut in the down version, I have one down, which might be less desirable, but since we care about min turns, same.\n\nBut perhaps I can have a sequence with fewer than 11 actions.\n\nFor example, if I can reach row 4 at t=20, but start later or something, but I have to start from t=14.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 0 to 9, min 9 actions if no delay.\n\nBut with delay, min is 11 as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and wait, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 for some turns, then go up, but I might reach later.\n\nNot better.\n\nAnother idea: since row 4 is unsafe at t=17,18,19, but I can be on row 4 at t=16? But I cannot, earliest t=18.\n\nImpossible to be on row 4 before t=18.\n\nSo t=20 is earliest possible.\n\nThus minimal reach time for y=9 is t=25.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can be on row 4 at t=20 with fewer actions.\n\nFrom t=14 to t=20, 6 turns: t=14 to t=19 actions, t=20 position.\n\nAt t=20, y=4.\n\nFrom start, after 6 actions, y can be from 0 to 6, but to have y=4 at t=20, which is after 6 actions? Turns: t=14 start, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action: t=15, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions: at turn 14+k, y.\n\nAt turn 20, that is after 6 actions (since t=14 to t=20 is 6 actions: a_14 to a_19, y_20).\n\nTo have y_20=4, with actions from t=14 to t=19.\n\nI need net +4 in y.\n\nEach U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nI can have, for example, 4 U and 2 other actions, but the other actions must not increase y, so S or D.\n\nBut with S or D, I stay or decrease, so to reach y=4 in 6 actions, I need at least 4 U, and 2 S or D, so y=4.\n\nIn min time, I could have y=4 at t=18 with 4 U, but unsafe.\n\nWith 6 actions, I reach y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen from there, 5 U to y=9 at t=25.\n\nTotal actions 11.\n\nIf I can reach higher earlier, but I cannot because of row 4.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=3 at t=17, then I have to stay or go down to avoid row 4 at t=18.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the down version, I have a down action, but it's fine.\n\nIn the stay version, I have extra stay actions.\n\nBut both work.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with only up and stay, no down.\n\nBut in stay, I need to stay twice to reach at same time.\n\nIn the first stay idea, to reach y=4 at t=20, from t=17 y=3, I need to stay or move down.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 for one turn only: at t=17 y=3, a_17=S, y_18=3\n\nThen at t=18, I cannot go up because if a_18=U, y_19=4, but t=19 unsafe for row 4.\n\nSo I must not go up at t=18 if I want to avoid row 4 at t=19.\n\nIn that case, I have to stay again or go down.\n\nSo I cannot reach row 4 at t=20 with only one extra action; I need at least two extra actions before row 4.\n\nFrom min t=18 to t=20, I need to delay two turns.\n\nIn the down version, I used one down, which effectively delays by moving away and back, but same number of actions.\n\nSo both require 11 actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, I need to make sure about rows 5-8, but in this case, since I cross after t=20, t=21 for row 5, which is after t=18, so safe.\n\nNow, but row 4 at t=20,21,etc. is fine.\n\nAnother thing: at t=18, in the down sequence, I was at row 2, which is safe.\n\nIn stay sequence, at row 3, safe.\n\nNow, I think it's ok.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier by going faster on higher rows, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 9 directly or something, but impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, I need to output from turn t1=14.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nNow, in the sequence with down:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nThen at turn 25, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are up to turn 24.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for H=11, t from 0 to 10, t1 + t from 14 to 24.\n\nActions: a14 to a24.\n\nWith stay:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nSame number.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut perhaps with down, I have one less stay, but not necessary.\n\nIn the down version, at turn 17 I go down, so at turn 18 I am at y=2, then go up.\n\nBut y=2 is row 2, which is always safe except late, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but I need to confirm if row 2 is safe at t=18.\n\nRow 2 unsafe at T=30,31,32,33, t=18 is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for row 5-8, at T=18 unsafe, but I am not on them at that time.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence without down or with less, but I think 11 is min.\n\nAnother thought: since rows 1-3 are safe early, I could stay there longer, but that would make me later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nt=14: a_14=S, y_15=0\n\nt=15: a_15=U, y_16=1\n\nt=16: a_16=U, y_17=2\n\nt=17: a_17=U, y_18=3\n\nt=18: a_18=S, y_19=3 (since if U, y_19=4 unsafe)\n\nThen a_19=U, y_20=4\n\nThen same as before, but I started later, reached y=4 at t=20, but I wasted one turn at start, so reach later.\n\nt=20 y=4, then to y=9 at t=25, but now with actions from a_14 to a_24, same 11 actions, but I have an extra stay.\n\nIn this case, a_14=S, a_15=U, etc., still 11 actions to a_24.\n\nBut y reached at t=25 same.\n\nNo gain.\n\nThus, the sequences I have are fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to box the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car list, for freeway 4, I have cars, and I think I covered.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at t=20, row 4, is it safe?\n\nRow 4 unsafe at T=17,18,19,26,27,28.\n\nt=20 not in, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, I think it's ok.\n\nSo I can provide the sequence.\n\nIn the output, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: D\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}\n\nBut in this, at turn 24: U, to y_25=9.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nTo write in the format.\n\nSince the player position is given at turn t1=14, and we need actions from t1 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn t1 + H - 1, to reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn this case, t1=14, H=11, so actions from turn 14 to turn 24, reach at turn 25.\n\nIn the answer, it should list Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can write the actions without down, but with stay.\n\nBut either is acceptable.\n\nI think with down is fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can avoid down.\n\nFor example, in the stay sequence with two S.\n\nBut same H.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are safe after t=18, and I can go fast, but I need to delay row 4.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go up to row 3 quickly, then wait, but as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to row 0 and wait, but worse.\n\nI think 11 is min.\n\nSo I'll go with the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 17: D, to y=2.\n\nBut row 2 is safe.\n\nTo have only horizontal, but with stay.\n\nBut for minimality, same.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, I have three cars, but I think I correctly identified unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5, at t=18, but I am not there.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to row 5 at t=21, safe.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, output.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is not on a freeway row (1-8) when a car occupies position \\(x=0\\) at that turn.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway row are:\n- Row 1, 2, 3: Unsafe at turns 30, 31, 32, 33 (safe at turn 18).\n- Row 4: Unsafe at turns 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28 (safe at turn 20).\n- Row 5, 6, 7, 8: Unsafe only at turn 18 (safe at turns 19 and later).\n\nThe earliest safe time to be on row 4 is turn 20, as turns 18 and 19 are unsafe and it is impossible to reach row 4 before turn 18. From row 4 at turn 20, it takes 5 additional up actions to reach row 9, arriving at turn 25. To delay reaching row 4 until turn 20, the sequence includes a down action at turn 17 to avoid row 4 at the unsafe turns 18 and 19.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turn 14: U (move to row 1 at turn 15, safe).\n- Turn 15: U (move to row 2 at turn 16, safe).\n- Turn 16: U (move to row 3 at turn 17, safe).\n- Turn 17: D (move to row 2 at turn 18, safe).\n- Turn 18: U (move to row 3 at turn 19, safe).\n- Turn 19: U (move to row 4 at turn 20, safe).\n- Turn 20: U (move to row 5 at turn 21, safe).\n- Turn 21: U (move to row 6 at turn 22, safe).\n- Turn 22: U (move to row 7 at turn 23, safe).\n- Turn 23: U (move to row 8 at turn 24, safe).\n- Turn 24: U (move to row 9 at turn 25, safe).\n\nThis sequence reaches row 9 at turn 25 (after 11 actions) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: U\n}",

The current turn is t₁ = 18.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars are on specific freeways, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 on that freeway at the same turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, important: when I move to a new y-position, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions U (+1), D (-1), S (0).\n\nI start at turn t₁=18, position (0,2). I need to reach (0,9).\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is what I need to minimize, so I should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=18, and then how they move over time.\n\nThe car state is given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_ref), h + s(t - t_ref)], but the state is given at t₁=18, so for any T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T - 18), h + s(T - 18)] for right-moving cars.\n\nLet's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSo at t₁=18, Span(18) = [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"head h, tail τ\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\n\nIn the text: \"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nThen for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nLooking at freeway 4, it has three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 have two cars each, all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 have one car each, right-moving.\n\nNo left-moving cars mentioned.\n\nIn the car state table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) so head h=-36, tail τ=-47? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here h=-36, τ=-47, so since -36 > -47, yes, head is at -36, tail at -47, so the car is from -47 to -36, length 11, moving right at speed 3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nThat is, if the car covers position 0 at turn T.\n\nSince I move at the same time, I think the position is checked after movement or something? But from the collision rule, it seems that at turn T, my position y_T determines which freeway I'm on, and then we check if any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if they are at 0.\n\nSimilarly, I am on y_T at turn T, so I can collide with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at turn 18.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe shortest path would be to go up 7 times, so H=7, actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 2 to 9 in 7 steps.\n\nBut I need to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nFirst, let's see for each freeway, when the cars are at position 0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to find for each y from 1 to 8, when it is safe to be on that y, meaning no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars on a freeway, I need to check all for each turn.\n\nLet me denote the time from t=18 onwards. Let τ = T - 18, so at τ=0, it's turn 18.\n\nThen for a car, at time τ (after t₁), the span is:\n\nFor right-moving car: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ and h are at t₁, s is speed.\n\nIn terms of τ, time offset.\n\nSet t = T - t₁, so t=0 at current turn.\n\nThen for a car with given (h, τ, d, s) at t=0 (which is t₁=18),\n\nAt time t (relative), Span(t) = \n\nIf right-moving: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*t, τ - s*t] but all are right-moving here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so Span(t) = [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nCollision on freeway k at time t if player is on y=k and 0 ∈ Span(t) for any car on k.\n\nNow, 0 ∈ [τ + s*t, h + s*t] means τ + s*t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*t\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving cars.\n\nSo, for a car, the times when it covers 0 are when τ + s*t ≤ 0 and h + s*t ≥ 0.\n\nThat is, t such that -h/s ≤ t ≤ -τ/s? Let's see.\n\nτ + s*t ≤ 0 ⇒ t ≤ -τ/s\n\nh + s*t ≥ 0 ⇒ t ≥ -h/s\n\nSince s > 0, and τ < h, -h/s < -τ/s, so t from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) or something, but t is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt is integer, time steps.\n\nSo for a car, it occupies 0 at time t if max( ceil(-h/s), something ) but let's compute the interval.\n\nThe car covers 0 when t is such that the left end <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nSo τ + s*t <= 0 and h + s*t >=0.\n\nSo t <= -τ/s and t >= -h/s\n\nSince s>0, -h/s <= t <= -τ/s\n\nBut since h and τ can be negative, etc.\n\nt must satisfy lower bound L = ceil(-h/s) and upper bound U = floor(-τ/s), but need to be careful with inequalities.\n\nSet L = min t such that h + s*t >=0, which is t >= ceil(-h/s) if -h/s not integer, etc., but easier to compute numerically.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars on each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=3, right\n\nAt time t, Span(t) = [ -47 + 3t, -36 + 3t ]\n\n0 ∈ Span(t) if -47 + 3t <= 0 and -36 + 3t >=0\n\nSo 3t <= 47 ⇒ t <= 47/3 = 15.666, so t <= 15\n\nAnd 3t >= 36 ⇒ t >= 12\n\nSo t from 12 to 15 inclusive.\n\n-47 + 3t <=0 ⇒ 3t <=47 ⇒ t <= 15 since t integer\n\n-36 + 3t >=0 ⇒ 3t >=36 ⇒ t >=12\n\nSo t=12,13,14,15\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-36,-47,right,3) identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 3) same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 each have a car that covers 0 at t=12,13,14,15 relative to t₁=18.\n\nt relative to 18, so absolute turn T = t + 18.\n\nBut for planning, we can use relative t.\n\nNow freeway 4: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nh=-32, τ=-43, s=4\n\nSpan(t) = [-43 + 4t, -32 + 4t]\n\n0 ∈ if -43+4t <=0 and -32+4t >=0\n\n4t <=43 ⇒ t <= 10.75, so t <=10\n\n4t >=32 ⇒ t >=8\n\nSo t=8,9,10\n\nSecond car: (4, -7, right, 4) head h=4, tail τ=-7? That can't be right.\n\nHead h=4, tail τ=-7, but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, 4 > -7, yes, so span from -7 to 4.\n\nAt t=0, span [τ, h] = [-7,4]\n\nIn the table: (4, -7, right, 4) so head=4, tail=-7.\n\nThen Span(t) = [-7 + 4t, 4 + 4t]\n\n0 ∈ Span(t) if -7 +4t <=0 and 4+4t >=0\n\n-7+4t <=0 ⇒ 4t <=7 ⇒ t <= 1.75, so t <=1\n\n4+4t >=0 ⇒ 4t >= -4 ⇒ t >= -1, but t>=0 since time from now, so always true for t>=0? t>=0, 4+4t >=4>0, so yes.\n\nBut -7+4t <=0 for t<=1, and since t>=0, for t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt t=0: span [-7,4], which includes 0.\n\nt=1: span [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], includes 0.\n\nt=2: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo for t=0 and t=1.\n\nBut t relative to now, t=0 is turn 18.\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (40, 29, right, 4) head=40, tail=29? 40>29, yes.\n\nSpan(t) = [29 + 4t, 40 + 4t]\n\n0 ∈ if 29+4t <=0 and 40+4t >=0\n\n29+4t <=0 ⇒ 4t <= -29 ⇒ t <= -7.25, impossible since t>=0\n\n40+4t >=0 always true.\n\nSo never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, the dangerous times are from car1: t=8,9,10\n\nCar2: t=0,1\n\nCar3: never\n\nSo overall for freeway 4, dangerous at t=0,1 (from car2) and t=8,9,10 (from car1)\n\nt=0,1,8,9,10\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars\n\nFirst: (0, -11, right, 12) head=0, tail=-11, s=12\n\nSpan(t) = [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t] = [-11+12t, 12t]\n\n0 ∈ Span(t) if -11+12t <=0 and 12t >=0\n\n12t >=0 always for t>=0\n\n-11+12t <=0 ⇒ 12t <=11 ⇒ t <= 11/12 <1, so t=0 only? Since t integer.\n\nAt t=0: span [-11,0], which includes 0? 0 is included, since tail or head? Span is [τ, h] = [-11,0], so 0 is the head, which is included, I assume, since it says \"span\" and collision if 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, in inequality, -11+12t <=0 and 12t >=0.\n\nAt t=0: -11 <=0 and 0>=0, true.\n\nAt t=1: span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only t=0.\n\nBut t=0 is now, turn 18.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (48, 37, right, 12) head=48, tail=37, s=12\n\nSpan(t) = [37+12t, 48+12t]\n\n0 ∈ if 37+12t <=0 and 48+12t >=0? 37+12t <=0 ⇒ t <= -37/12 <0 impossible, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 5, dangerous only at t=0 (from first car)\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (0, -11, right, 12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: (0, -11, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo all freeways 5,6,7,8 have the same: dangerous only at t=0 from the first car.\n\nNow freeway 1,2,3: dangerous at t=12,13,14,15\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at t=0,1,8,9,10\n\nt=0,1 from car2, and t=8,9,10 from car1.\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at t=0 (relative time).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe player moves with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at 2, need to go to 9, so minimum 7 steps if I go up each time.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous for that freeway at that time.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, I need to plan a path through the y-levels over time.\n\nLet me define a grid of time vs y-position.\n\nTime t from 0 to some max, say 20 or so.\n\ny from 0 to 9.\n\nFor each (t,y), it is safe if y=0 or y=9, since no cars, or if y between 1 and 8, and for that y, at time t, no car on freeway y has 0 in span.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe always, as no freeway or no cars.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nNow, for each freeway, the dangerous times:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): dangerous at t=12,13,14,15\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): same, t=12,13,14,15\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same, t=12,13,14,15\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): dangerous at t=0,1,8,9,10\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): dangerous at t=0\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): dangerous at t=0\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): dangerous at t=0\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): dangerous at t=0\n\nNow, at t=0, I am at y=2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is dangerous at t=12-15, but not at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, freeway 2 is safe, since dangerous only at t=12-15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 is dangerous at t=0 and t=1, etc.\n\nLet me list for each y, the safe times, or rather the dangerous times.\n\ny=1: dangerous t=12,13,14,15\n\ny=2: dangerous t=12,13,14,15\n\ny=3: dangerous t=12,13,14,15\n\ny=4: dangerous t=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=5: dangerous t=0\n\ny=6: dangerous t=0\n\ny=7: dangerous t=0\n\ny=8: dangerous t=0\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, at t=0, I am at y=2, which is safe at t=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some t.\n\nSince I start at 2, and 9 is 7 higher, minimum H=7 if I go up each turn.\n\nBut let's see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn: actions U each time.\n\nThen position over time:\n\nt=0: y=2\n\nt=1: y=3 (after action U at t=0? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSet relative time.\n\nAt time t (turn relative to t₁), before action, I am at position y_t.\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision is based on y_t and the state at time t.\n\nThe collision rule: at turn T, collision if on freeway y_T and 0 in span for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then after action, move to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor turn T, we use y_T to determine freeway.\n\nIn terms of relative t.\n\nAt time t (turn t₁ + t), position y_t.\n\nThen action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_t, at time t, 0 in span for some car.\n\nIf I am at y_t=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify actions from t=0 to t=H-1, such that at time H, I am at y=9? Let's see.\n\nI start at t=0, position y=2.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y_{H} = 9.\n\nThe turn when I reach is after H actions, so at time t=H, position y_H=9.\n\nAnd I need to be safe at each step t from 0 to H-1? Not necessarily at t=H, because at t=H, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe collision can only happen when on freeway 1-8, so at y=9, no collision.\n\nSimilarly at y=0.\n\nSo I need to be safe for t=0 to t=H-1, and at t=H, y_H=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to t=H-1, and y_t for t=0 to H.\n\ny_0 = 2 (given)\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1}\n\nAnd we want y_H = 9.\n\nAnd for each t from 0 to H-1, position y_t must be safe, meaning if 1<=y_t<=8, then it must not be dangerous at time t for that freeway.\n\nSince at t=H, y_H=9, safe.\n\nNow back to the direct path: go up every turn.\n\nActions: a_t = U for t=0 to 6? Start y_0=2\n\nt=0: a_0=U, then y_1=3\n\nt=1: a_1=U, y_2=4\n\nt=2: a_2=U, y_3=5\n\nt=3: a_3=U, y_4=6\n\nt=4: a_4=U, y_5=7\n\nt=5: a_5=U, y_6=8\n\nt=6: a_6=U, y_7=9\n\nSo after 7 actions, at t=7, y_7=9.\n\nNow, check safety at each t from 0 to 6.\n\nt=0: y_0=2, freeway 2. Dangerous times for y=2: t=12,13,14,15. t=0 not dangerous, so safe.\n\nt=1: y_1=3, freeway 3. Dangerous t=12-15, t=1 not, safe.\n\nt=2: y_2=4, freeway 4. Dangerous times: t=0,1,8,9,10. t=2 not dangerous? t=2, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at t=0,1,8,9,10. t=2 is not in this list, so should be safe.\n\nBut earlier for freeway 4, car2 dangerous at t=0,1, car1 at t=8,9,10. At t=2, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nt=3: y_3=5, freeway 5. Dangerous at t=0 only. t=3 not t=0, so safe.\n\nt=4: y_4=6, freeway 6, dangerous only at t=0, safe.\n\nt=5: y_5=7, freeway 7, dangerous only at t=0, safe.\n\nt=6: y_6=8, freeway 8, dangerous only at t=0, safe.\n\nThen t=7: y_7=9, safe.\n\nSo all safe? But t=2 at y=4, which is safe at t=2, yes.\n\nAnd for y=5,6,7,8, only dangerous at t=0, which is past.\n\nSo this seems possible with H=7.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nAt t=0, I am at y=2, which is freeway 2, and it is safe at t=0.\n\nThen I move to y=3 at t=1, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=2, freeway 4 safe at t=2.\n\nThen up to y=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor freeway 4 at t=2: cars?\n\nFirst car: at t=2, span [-43 + 4*2, -32 + 4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: span [-7 +4*2, 4+4*2] = [-7+8, 4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut for freeway 5 at t=3: first car span at t=3: [-11 +12*3, 12*3] = [-11+36, 36] = [25,36], no 0.\n\nSecond car: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], no.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nSo with 7 up actions, I can reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut the minimal H should be 7, since I need to go up 7 times.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it faster? No, because from 2 to 9, minimum 7 steps up, I can't jump.\n\nUnless I go down and up, but that would take more turns, so 7 is minimum.\n\nBut is there a reason I can't go directly?\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 4 at t=8,9,10, but in this path, at t=2 I am at y=4, which is before t=8, so not affected.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3, dangerous at t=12-15, but I pass through them early, at t=0,1 for y=2 and3, before t=12.\n\ny_0=2 at t=0, y_1=3 at t=1, both before t=12.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=7, actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U for t=0 to 6.\n\nt from 0 to 6, that's 7 actions.\n\nNow, in terms of turns: t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=7, so actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + 6.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=18.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nThen at turn 25, position y=9.\n\nt=0: turn 18, action a_{18}, then y_{19} = 3? Let's index properly.\n\nSet absolute turn.\n\nTurn T: position y_T, action a_T.\n\nGiven at turn 18, y_{18} = 2.\n\nAfter action a_{18}, y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy\n\nAfter a_{19}, y_{20} = y_{19} + Δy, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{18 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 18+H, position is 9.\n\nAnd safe at turns 18 to 18+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 18 to turn 18+H-1.\n\nFor H=7, actions at turn 18 to 23, then y_{24} =9.\n\ny_{18} =2\n\nAfter a_{18}, y_{19} = 2 + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{23}, y_{24} = ?\n\nAfter k actions, y_{18+k} = y_{18} + sum of Δy from t=0 to k-1.\n\nSet k from 0.\n\nAt turn 18 + t for t=0,1,2,... \n\nPosition y_{18+t}\n\nAction a_{18+t} at turn 18+t.\n\nThen y_{18+t+1} = y_{18+t} + Δy_t\n\nWith y_{18+0} = y_{18} =2\n\nWe want y_{18+H} =9 for some H.\n\nThen actions a_{18} to a_{18+H-1}\n\nAnd for each turn T from 18 to 18+H-1, position y_T must be safe.\n\nIn this case, with all U:\n\na_{18} = U, y_{19} =3\n\na_{19} = U, y_{20} =4\n\na_{20} = U, y_{21} =5\n\na_{21} = U, y_{22} =6\n\na_{22} = U, y_{23} =7\n\na_{23} = U, y_{24} =8? y_{18} =2\n\nAfter a_{18}: y_{19} = 2 +1 =3\n\na_{19}: y_{20} =3+1=4\n\na_{20}: y_{21}=4+1=5\n\na_{21}: y_{22}=5+1=6\n\na_{22}: y_{23}=6+1=7\n\na_{23}: y_{24}=7+1=8\n\ny_{24}=8, but we need y=9, so not yet.\n\nI need one more U.\n\ny_{18} =2\n\nAfter 1 U: y_{19}=3\n\nAfter 2: y_{20}=4\n\n3: y_{21}=5\n\n4: y_{22}=6\n\n5: y_{23}=7\n\n6: y_{24}=8\n\n7: y_{25}=9\n\nSo with 7 actions: a_{18} to a_{24}, then y_{25}=9.\n\nTurns: actions at 18,19,20,21,22,23,24, then position at 25 is 9.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nAt turn 24, y_{24}=8, which is before action, but we need to be safe at turn 24 as well.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns from 18 to 24, positions y_{18} to y_{24}.\n\ny_{18}=2, y_{19}=3, ..., y_{24}=8.\n\nThen after action at 24, y_{25}=9.\n\nWe need safe at turns T=18 to 24 (since up to H-1? Let's see.\n\nT from 18 to 18+H-1 for positions.\n\nWith H actions, positions from turn 18 to 18+H.\n\nTurn 18: position y_{18}, safe\n\nTurn 19: y_{19}, safe\n\n...\n\nTurn 18+H: y_{18+H}, which is 9, safe.\n\nIn this case, for H=7, positions at turn 18 to 24: y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nAll must be safe at their respective turns.\n\nIn our earlier relative time, t=0 to 6.\n\nt=0 (turn18): y=2, safe\n\nt=1 (turn19): y=3, safe\n\nt=2 (turn20): y=4, safe? Turn 20, relative t=2.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at t=0,1,8,9,10 relative.\n\nt=2 not dangerous, safe.\n\nt=3 (turn21): y=5, freeway 5 dangerous only at t=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=4 (turn22): y=6, safe\n\nt=5 (turn23): y=7, safe\n\nt=6 (turn24): y=8, freeway 8 dangerous only at t=0, safe.\n\nThen turn25: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a car at t=0 on freeway 2? No, freeway 2 dangerous at t=12-15, not t=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 18, on freeway 2, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2: car at turn 18: span [-47 +3*0, -36+3*0]? Relative t=0.\n\nSpan at t=0: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-47, -36] for y=2, but this is the position, 0 not in [-47,-36], so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in 7 turns.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 5 at t=0.\n\nAt turn 18, freeway 5: car (0,-11,right,12), span at t=0: [-11,0], which includes 0, so if I were on y=5 at t=0, I would collide, but I am on y=2, not y=5.\n\nIn my path, I am never on y=5 at t=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=7 is achievable.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving.\n\nFor example, when I move from y to y+1, at turn T, I am on y, so if y is safe at T, ok, and I move to y+1, but at turn T, I am not on y+1, so even if y+1 is dangerous at T, it's fine.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4 at t=8,9,10, but I am not there at that time.\n\nt=8 relative is turn 18+8=26, which is later, I am already at y=9 by then.\n\ny=9 at turn 25, turn 26 I am still at 9 or moved, but not on freeway.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with less? Impossible, since 2 to 9, 7 steps needed.\n\nUnless I start at 2, and go to 9, min delta y=7, so min 7 actions.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nThen at turn 25, position (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, up to turn 24, since H-1=6? H=7 actions from t=0 to 6, which is turn 18 to 24.\n\nThen position at turn 25 is 9.\n\nThe answer format should list actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nBut is turn 24 included? Actions from turn 18 to turn 18+H-1.\n\nH=7, so turns 18 to 24 inclusive, that's 7 actions.\n\nTurn 18,19,20,21,22,23,24: 7 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at t=0 and t=1 dangerous, but I am at y=4 only at t=2 relative, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 4 at turn 20, which is t=2 relative.\n\nTurn 20: y=4? In my sequence, at turn 20, position y_{20}=4 (since y_{19}=3 after a_{18}=U, y_{20}=4 after a_{19}=U? Let's list:\n\nTurn 18: action a_{18}=U, then y_{19}=3\n\nTurn 19: action a_{19}=U, then y_{20}=4\n\nTurn 20: action a_{20}=U, then y_{21}=5\n\nSo at turn 20, position y_{20}=4.\n\nRelative t=2 (since turn 18 +2 =20).\n\nFreeway 4 at t=2: as above, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: on freeway 5,6,7,8, dangerous only at t=0, which is turn 18.\n\nBut at turn 18, I am at y=2, not on those.\n\nAnd later, when I am on y=5 at turn 21, which is t=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7 with all U actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so yes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nAnd that's 7 lines.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I try to go faster, impossible.\n\nOr slower, but no need.\n\nPerhaps if there was a problem at y=4, but there isn't.\n\nAnother point: at turn 18, for freeway 4, car2: (4,-7,right,4), at t=0, span [-7,4], includes 0, so if I were on y=4 at turn 18, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly at turn 19, t=1, span for car2: [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], includes 0, dangerous for y=4.\n\nBut I am at y=4 only at turn 20, t=2, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe direct upward path is feasible and achieves the goal in \\(H = 7\\) turns, as moving from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires exactly 7 upward moves, and no collisions occur along this path given the car positions and movements.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Dangerous at turns 30, 31, 32, 33 (relative t=12,13,14,15). Not encountered at these times.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Dangerous at turns 30, 31, 32, 33. At turn 18 (t=0), y=2 is safe.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Dangerous at turns 30, 31, 32, 33. At turn 19 (t=1), y=3 is safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Dangerous at turns 18, 19, 26, 27, 28 (relative t=0,1,8,9,10). At turn 20 (t=2), y=4 is safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Dangerous only at turn 18 (t=0). At turn 21 (t=3), y=5 is safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Dangerous only at turn 18 (t=0). At turn 22 (t=4), y=6 is safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Dangerous only at turn 18 (t=0). At turn 23 (t=5), y=7 is safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Dangerous only at turn 18 (t=0). At turn 24 (t=6), y=8 is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is all \"U\" (up) for 7 turns, moving the player from y=2 to y=3 at turn 19, y=4 at turn 20, and so on, reaching y=9 at turn 25. Each position from turn 18 to turn 24 is safe, and y=9 at turn 25 is inherently safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 18: U (move to y=3 at turn 19)\n- Turn 19: U (move to y=4 at turn 20)\n- Turn 20: U (move to y=5 at turn 21)\n- Turn 21: U (move to y=6 at turn 22)\n- Turn 22: U (move to y=7 at turn 23)\n- Turn 23: U (move to y=8 at turn 24)\n- Turn 24: U (move to y=9 at turn 25)\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H = 7\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t=24 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right at their speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so I only check collisions for the y I'm currently on.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is above the freeways, so y=9 has no cars; it's safe. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume. The vertical axis is y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are like safe zones or something. But the player starts at (0,0), which is y=0, and needs to reach (0,9). Since y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I don't collide there. Collisions only happen on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, collision occurs only if for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, say from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, so I check for collision on y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, I'm on y+1, so I check for collision on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the current state is at t=24.\n\nPlayer position: (0,0)\n\nCar states:\n\nFor each freeway k (which I think is y=k), there are cars listed.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)  // head and tail, direction, speed\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_ref), h + s(t - t_ref)] but here t_ref is t_1=24, I think.\n\nThe car update is given with reference to turn t_1.\n\nFor car at t_1, span is given, then at T > t_1, span is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)] for left-moving, or [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo at t_1=24, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince right-moving, the span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], I think? But it says head and tail, but for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail if we think of position increasing.\n\nIn the span definition: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, τ] at t_1, then [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] at T.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3), so at t_1=24, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But -59 is less than -48, so [ -59, -48 ] meaning from -59 to -48, which is 11 units long? But the car length should be |h - τ| + 1 or something? Not specified, but span is inclusive I assume.\n\nSince head and tail, for right-moving, if moving right, tail is left end, head is right end, so position increases from tail to head.\n\nSo at t_1, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 3(T-24), -48 + 3(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n0 in span means min(span) <= 0 <= max(span), since span is a closed interval I assume.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check for each car if 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway at t_1=24.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (-48, -59, right, 3) so span at T: [ -59 + 3(T-24), -48 + 3(T-24) ]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): similar, (-48, -59, right, 3) same as y=1? Let me see.\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\nk=1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nk=2: (-48, -59, right, 3) same as k=1\n\nk=3: (-48, -59, right, 3) same\n\nk=4: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)  // three cars\n\nk=5: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nk=6: same as k=5? (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nk=7: same: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nk=8: same: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFor k=4, there are three cars.\n\nI need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on each freeway at various times.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=24, and I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H might be 9, if I go up every turn, but I might hit cars on the way.\n\nFirst, let's find the positions over time.\n\nDefine time relative to t_1.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn t_1=24.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at relative time H, so at absolute time t_1 + H, but the sequence is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, and action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check collision for y_T at time T.\n\nAt the next turn, I am on y_{T+1}, check for that.\n\nSo, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn T, and since y=9 has no cars, no collision, so I just need to arrive at y=9.\n\nThe turn when I first reach y=9, at that turn I am on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since I start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, the minimal number of moves is 9 up actions, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, which might increase H.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go up directly in 9 turns.\n\nBut I need to check for each freeway y=1 to 8, at the time I am on it, if 0 is in a car span.\n\nSince I go up one per turn, if I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision check. I choose action a_{t1} = U, so at τ=1 (turn t1+1), I am at y=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, I am on y=1, so check if 0 in car span for y=1 at time τ=1 (absolute T= t1 +1 =25)\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2, y=2, check at T=26, and so on, up to at τ=9, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, I need to compute for each freeway k, at time T when I am on it, if 0 is in some car's span for that k at that T.\n\nTime absolute: since τ = T - t1, and t1=24, so T = τ + 24.\n\nFor freeway y, when I am on it at relative time τ, absolute time T = τ + 24.\n\nThen for that freeway, at time T, check if 0 in span for any car.\n\nIf not, safe.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find when 0 is in the span.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1 (y=1): one car, right-moving, s=3.\n\nAt t1, span [-59, -48]? Earlier: at t1, for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-24), -48 + 3(T-24)]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -59 + 3(T-24) <= 0 <= -48 + 3(T-24)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -59 + 3(T-24) <= 0 => 3(T-24) <= 59 => T-24 <= 59/3 = 19.666, so T <= 24 + 19.666 = 43.666, so T <= 43 since T integer.\n\nT-24 <= 19.666, so T <= 43.666, T <= 43.\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 + 3(T-24) => 48 <= 3(T-24) => 16 <= T-24 => T >= 40.\n\nSo T from 40 to 43 inclusive.\n\nFor k=1, 0 in span at T=40,41,42,43.\n\nAbsolute T.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: same car, same parameters, (-48,-59,right,3), so same as k=1, 0 in span at T=40 to 43.\n\nSimilarly k=3: same, T=40 to 43.\n\nNow k=4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\ns=4, right-moving.\n\nAt T, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 4(T-24), -48 + 4(T-24)]\n\n0 in span: -59 +4(T-24) <= 0 <= -48 +4(T-24)\n\nLeft: -59 +4(T-24) <=0 => 4(T-24) <=59 => T-24 <=14.75 => T<=38.75, T<=38\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +4(T-24) => 48 <=4(T-24) => 12 <= T-24 => T>=36\n\nSo T=36,37,38.\n\nBut T=36: min = -59 +4(12) = -59+48= -11 <=0, max= -48+48=0, so 0 <=0 <=0, yes included.\n\nT=37: min=-59+4(13)= -59+52=-7, max=-48+52=4, 0 in between.\n\nT=38: min=-59+56=-3, max=-48+56=8, 0 in.\n\nT=39: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, 1 to 12, 0 not included. So T=36,37,38.\n\nSecond car on k=4: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nAt T, span [-23 +4(T-24), -12 +4(T-24)]\n\n0 in: -23+4(T-24) <=0 <= -12+4(T-24)\n\nLeft: -23+4(T-24)<=0 => 4(T-24)<=23 => T-24<=5.75 => T<=29.75, T<=29\n\nRight: 0<= -12+4(T-24) => 12<=4(T-24) => 3<=T-24 => T>=27\n\nSo T=27,28,29.\n\nT=27: min=-23+4(3)= -23+12=-11, max=-12+12=0, 0 included.\n\nT=28: min=-23+16=-7, max=-12+16=4, 0 in.\n\nT=29: min=-23+20=-3, max=-12+20=8, 0 in.\n\nT=30: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, 1 to 12, no 0.\n\nThird car on k=4: (24,13,right,4)\n\nHead h=24, tail τ=13, right-moving.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 +4(T-24), 24 +4(T-24)]\n\n0 in: min=13+4(T-24) <=0 <= max=24+4(T-24)\n\nBut min=13+4(T-24) >0 for T>=24, since at T=24, min=13>0, so always min>0, thus 0 never <= min, so 0 not in span for this car. Since min is at least 13 at T=24, increasing.\n\nSo only first two cars matter for k=4.\n\nThus for k=4, 0 in span at T where either first car or second car has it.\n\nFirst car: T=36,37,38\n\nSecond car: T=27,28,29\n\nNo overlap, so combined, T=27,28,29,36,37,38.\n\nNow k=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\ns=12, right-moving.\n\nAt T, span [-59 +12(T-24), -48 +12(T-24)]\n\n0 in: -59+12(T-24) <=0 <= -48+12(T-24)\n\nLeft: -59+12(T-24)<=0 => 12(T-24)<=59 => T-24<=59/12≈4.916, T<=28.916, T<=28\n\nRight: 0<= -48+12(T-24) => 48<=12(T-24) => 4<=T-24 => T>=28\n\nT>=28 and T<=28, so only T=28.\n\nAt T=28: min= -59 +12(4) = -59+48= -11 <=0, max= -48+48=0, 0<=0<=0, yes.\n\nSecond car on k=5: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt t1, head h=0, tail τ=-11, right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 +12(T-24), 0 +12(T-24) ] = [-11 +12(T-24), 12(T-24)]\n\n0 in: min <=0 <= max\n\nmin = -11 +12(T-24)\n\nmax = 12(T-24)\n\nSince max = 12(T-24), and min = -11 +12(T-24) < max for all T.\n\n0 <= max always since max >=0 for T>=24? At T=24, max=0, min=-11.\n\n0 <= max: since max=12(T-24), so 0 <= 12(T-24) implies T-24 >=0, so T>=24, always true since T>t1 or T>=t1.\n\nT>=t1=24.\n\nAnd min <=0: -11 +12(T-24) <=0 => 12(T-24) <=11 => T-24 <=11/12<1, so T-24 <=0 since integer, T<=24.\n\nAt T=24, min= -11 +0 = -11 <=0, max=0, so 0 <= max=0, and min=-11<=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt T=25, min= -11 +12(1)=1, max=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min, not in span.\n\nSimilarly for T>24.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span only at T=24.\n\nBut at T=24, for k=5.\n\nNow back to first car: only T=28.\n\nSo for k=5, 0 in span at T=24 (from second car) and T=28 (from first car).\n\nT=24: second car, span [-11,0] at T=24, so yes.\n\nT=28: first car, as above.\n\nNow for k=6,7,8: same as k=5? Let's see.\n\nk=6: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12) same as k=5.\n\nSimilarly k=7 and k=8 same.\n\nSo for each of k=5,6,7,8, 0 in span at T=24 and T=28.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied (collision if on that y at that T).\n\ny=1: T=40,41,42,43\n\ny=2: same, T=40,41,42,43\n\ny=3: same, T=40,41,42,43\n\ny=4: T=27,28,29,36,37,38\n\ny=5: T=24,28\n\ny=6: T=24,28\n\ny=7: T=24,28\n\ny=8: T=24,28\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, T=24, y=0.\n\nI need to go through y=1 to 8, each at some time, and avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied at that time.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway y=k, when I am on it at time T, T must not be in the occupied times for that k.\n\nSince I move one step at a time, I will visit each y from 1 to 8 exactly once, but I might stay or move down, so I might not visit all, or visit some multiple times, but to minimize time, I should go up directly if possible, but if not, I might need to delay or something.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and I start from y=0, I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe path: I must go from y=0 to y=9, changing y by at most 1 each turn.\n\nAt each turn, I am at some y, and I choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since I want to minimize turns, staying or going down might increase turns, so I should avoid that unless necessary to wait.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if I go up every turn.\n\nWith actions: from t=24 to t=32, actions a24 to a31, then at t=32, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, t=24, y=0, I choose a24, then at τ=1, t=25, y=1 if a24=U, etc.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nStart: τ=0, t=24, y=0, not on freeway.\n\na24=U → τ=1, t=25, y=1\n\nNow on y=1 at t=25. Is y=1 occupied at t=25? y=1 occupied at T=40,41,42,43. t=25 not in, so safe.\n\na25=U → τ=2, t=26, y=2\n\ny=2 at t=26, occupied at 40-43, not 26, safe.\n\na26=U → τ=3, t=27, y=3\n\ny=3 at t=27, occupied at 40-43, not 27, safe.\n\na27=U → τ=4, t=28, y=4\n\ny=4 at t=28. Now y=4 occupied at T=27,28,29,36,37,38. t=28 is in, so at t=28, on y=4, 0 is occupied, collision!\n\nOh, so if I go up at t=27, I reach y=4 at t=28, which is occupied.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go up at t=27, to y=4 at t=28, but t=28 is occupied for y=4.\n\nBut at t=27, I am at y=3, and I choose action, if I go up, I go to y=4 at t=28.\n\nBut at t=28, y=4 is occupied.\n\nI could stay or go down to avoid.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=4 at t=28.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nNow, for y=5,6,7,8, occupied at t=24 and t=28.\n\nt=24: at t=24, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so for y=5, at t=24 occupied, but I am not on y=5, so no collision.\n\nThen when I reach y=5, say at some time.\n\nIn the direct up path: at t=27, I am at y=3, go U to y=4 at t=28.\n\nBut y=4 at t=28 occupied.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=4 at t=28.\n\nOptions: at t=27, instead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at t=28? At t=27, I am at y=3, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose S, then at t=28, I am still at y=3.\n\ny=3 occupied at T=40-43, not at t=28, so safe.\n\nThen at t=28, I am at y=3, I can choose to go U to y=4 at t=29.\n\nNow t=29, y=4 occupied? y=4 occupied at 27,28,29,36,37,38. t=29 is occupied, so if I go to y=4 at t=29, still occupied.\n\nIf I go U at t=27 to y=4 at t=28, occupied.\n\nIf I go S at t=27, stay at y=3 at t=28.\n\nThen at t=28, I am at y=3, which is safe (not occupied).\n\nThen I can go U to y=4 at t=29.\n\nBut at t=29, y=4 is occupied, so collision.\n\nIf I go D at t=27, to y=2 at t=28.\n\ny=2 at t=28: occupied at 40-43, not 28, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=2, need to go up later, which takes more time.\n\nBut I need to reach y=4 when it is not occupied.\n\ny=4 not occupied when? From the times: occupied at 27,28,29,36,37,38.\n\nSo safe times for y=4 are T<27 or 30<=T<=35 or T>38.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nI need to schedule when I am on each freeway.\n\nSince I start at t=24, y=0.\n\nI need to be on y=1 at some T1, not in occ for y=1\n\ny=2 at T2, not occ for y=2\n\n...\n\ny=8 at T8, not occ for y=8\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nAnd the times must be increasing, and |T_{i+1} - T_i| <=1? Not necessarily, because I can stay or move slowly.\n\nT_i is the time when I am on y=i.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, the times when I am on consecutive y's differ by at least 1, but I can stay multiple turns, so T_{i} and T_{i+1} could be the same if I move up? No.\n\nAt a given turn, I am at one y.\n\nSo the sequence of positions: at time T, y_T.\n\nThen y_{T+1} = y_T, y_T ±1.\n\nSo when I move from y to y+1, at time T I am at y, at T+1 at y+1.\n\nThe time I am on y=k is some set of times, but since I pass through each y, I am on each k from 1 to 8 at least once, at some time T_k.\n\nAnd T_k must not be in the occupied times for k.\n\nMoreover, since I move step by step, for consecutive freeways, |T_k - T_{k+1}| =1 only if I move directly between them, but if I stay, T_k and T_{k+1} could be farther.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=3 for several turns, then T_3 has multiple times, but I only need one time when I am on it and not occupied.\n\nBut since occupied times are specific, I need to choose T_k such that at T_k, y=k is not occupied, and the sequence T_k must be consistent with movement.\n\nThat is, |T_{k+1} - T_k| >=1, and y changes by at most 1 each turn.\n\nTo minimize the total time, I should make the T_k as small as possible, but avoiding occupied times.\n\nStart from y=0 at t=24.\n\nFirst, I need to reach y=1.\n\nI can be on y=1 at any time after t=24, but not at occupied times.\n\ny=1 occupied at T=40,41,42,43. So for T<=39 or T>=44, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to go through all.\n\nSince I start near, I should go up as soon as possible.\n\nList the occupied times for each y:\n\ny=1: occ: 40-43 → safe: T<=39 or T>=44\n\ny=2: same, occ:40-43 → safe T<=39 or T>=44\n\ny=3: occ:40-43 → safe T<=39 or T>=44\n\ny=4: occ:27,28,29,36,37,38 → safe: T<=26 or 30<=T<=35 or T>=39\n\nT<=26 or 30-35 or T>=39\n\ny=5: occ:24,28 → safe: T not 24 or 28, so for T=25,26,27,29,30,... except 24 and 28\n\nSimilarly y=6: same as y=5, occ:24,28 → safe T not 24,28\n\ny=7: occ:24,28 → safe T not 24,28\n\ny=8: occ:24,28 → safe T not 24,28\n\nNow, I need to choose times T1 to T8 when I am on y=1 to y=8 respectively, with each T_k safe for that y, and |T_{k+1} - T_k| =1 for consecutive k, because when I move from k to k+1, at time T I am at k, T+1 at k+1, so T_k and T_{k+1} are consecutive times if I move directly.\n\nIf I move directly from y to y+1 without staying, then T_{y+1} = T_y + 1.\n\nI could stay at some y for multiple turns, then T_{y} has multiple times, but for the purpose of avoiding collision, I only need that at the time I am on y, it is not occupied. So I can choose to be on y at a safe time, even if I stay multiple times, as long as at least one time is safe, but since I have to pass through, and I can choose when to be there by delaying or hurrying.\n\nTo minimize total turns, I should avoid staying extra, so I should move directly up when possible, only deviating when necessary.\n\nIn this case, since occupied times are early for some, late for others.\n\nStart at t=24, y=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at t=25.\n\nt=25, is y=1 safe? Yes, since occ only at 40-43.\n\nSimilarly, go to y=2 at t=26, safe.\n\ny=3 at t=27, safe.\n\nNow y=4: if I go to y=4 at t=28, but t=28 occ for y=4.\n\nNot safe.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at t=27? But at t=27, I am at y=3, if I go U, at t=28 to y=4. I cannot be at y=4 at t=27 because I am at y=3 at t=27.\n\nThe times I can be on y=4: earliest at t=28 if I go up from y=3 at t=27.\n\nAt t=27, y=3, go U to y=4 at t=28.\n\nOr later.\n\nBut t=28 occ, t=29 occ, t=30 safe? y=4 safe at T<=26 or 30-35 or T>=39.\n\nT<=26: but at t=26, I am at y=2 if going up, or earlier, but t=26 is before I can reach y=4 if I go directly.\n\nEarliest I can be at y=4 is t=28.\n\nt=28 and t=29 occ, t=30 safe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=4 at t=30 or later safe time.\n\nSimilarly, after y=4, I need to go to y=5, etc.\n\nNow, at t=27, I am at y=3.\n\nInstead of going up to y=4 at t=28 which is occ, I can stay at y=3 for some turns.\n\ny=3 is safe at all times except 40-43, so at t=28, I can be at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=28, I am at y=3, I can go to y=4 at t=29, but t=29 occ for y=4, not safe.\n\nIf I stay again at y=3 at t=29, safe.\n\nThen at t=29, go to y=4 at t=30.\n\nt=30, y=4 safe? y=4 safe at 30-35, yes.\n\nSo at t=30, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can proceed up.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=30, I can go to y=5 at t=31.\n\nNow y=5 at t=31: safe? y=5 occ at 24 and 28, so t=31 not occ, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at t=32, y=6 occ at 24,28, not 32, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=33, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=34, safe? y=8 occ at 24,28, not 34, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=35.\n\nAt t=34, y=8, go U to y=9 at t=35.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, let's list the actions.\n\nStart t=24, y=0, I need to choose actions.\n\nAt t=24, y=0, I choose a24.\n\nIf I go U, to y=1 at t=25.\n\nI can do that.\n\na24 = U → t=25, y=1\n\na25 = U → t=26, y=2\n\na26 = U → t=27, y=3\n\nNow at t=27, y=3, I need to not go to y=4 immediately because t=28 occ.\n\nSo I should stay or go down.\n\nIf I stay, a27 = S, then at t=28, y=3 (safe)\n\nAt t=28, y=3, I still cannot go to y=4 because t=29 occ? t=29 y=4 occ.\n\ny=4 occ at 27,28,29.\n\nSo at t=28, y=3, if I go U, to y=4 at t=29 occ.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=3 again.\n\na28 = S, at t=29, y=3 (safe)\n\nThen at t=29, y=3, now I can go U to y=4 at t=30, which is safe.\n\na29 = U → t=30, y=4\n\nThen from here, go up.\n\na30 = U → t=31, y=5\n\ny=5 at t=31, safe (occ only 24,28)\n\na31 = U → t=32, y=6, safe\n\na32 = U → t=33, y=7, safe\n\na33 = U → t=34, y=8, safe\n\na34 = U → t=35, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, how many turns? From t=24 to t=34, actions from a24 to a34, that's 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt t=24, action a24, after that position at t=25.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=24.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=24, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (a24), at t=25, y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=24 + k.\n\nWe reach y=9 at t=35, which is after how many actions?\n\nAt t=24, before any action.\n\nAfter first action (a24 at t=24), position at t=25.\n\nAfter second action (a25 at t=25), position at t=26, and so on.\n\nSo to have position at t=24 + H equal to 9.\n\nAt time t=24 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=35, y=9.\n\nt=24 + H =35, so H=11.\n\nActions from t=24 to t=34, that is actions at t=24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. That's 11 actions.\n\nSequence: a24 to a34.\n\nIn the plan above:\n\nt=24: a24=U → t=25 y=1\n\nt=25: a25=U → t=26 y=2\n\nt=26: a26=U → t=27 y=3\n\nt=27: a27=S → t=28 y=3 (stay)\n\nt=28: a28=S → t=29 y=3 (stay again)\n\nt=29: a29=U → t=30 y=4\n\nt=30: a30=U → t=31 y=5\n\nt=31: a31=U → t=32 y=6\n\nt=32: a32=U → t=33 y=7\n\nt=33: a33=U → t=34 y=8\n\nt=34: a34=U → t=35 y=9\n\nYes, H=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? I used two stays at y=3.\n\nCan I do with fewer?\n\nFor example, instead of staying twice, can I go down or something to save time? Going down might not help.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is safe at t=30, but I reached y=3 at t=27, so I need to wait until t=29 to go up to y=4 at t=30.\n\nFrom t=27 to t=29, I stay at y=3 for two turns, so two extra turns.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=4 earlier? Earliest safe time for y=4 is t=30, since t=28 and 29 occ, t=27 is before I can reach, min t=28.\n\nt=30 is the earliest possible safe time for y=4.\n\nI could go to y=4 later, but that might be worse.\n\nAnother thing: I have to pass y=5 to y=8, which have occ at t=24 and t=28.\n\nt=24 is past, and I am not on them at t=24, so as long as I am not on them at t=28, it should be fine.\n\nIn the above, I am on y=5 at t=31>28, safe.\n\nBut t=28 is a problem for multiple y.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=28, I am at y=3, which is fine.\n\nCould I be on a different y at t=28 to avoid the occ there?\n\nFor example, if I were on y=5 at t=28, but y=5 occ at t=28, so not safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,6,7,8 all occ at t=28 except y=1,2,3 are safe at t=28.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe at t=28, since occ only late.\n\ny=4 occ, y=5 occ, etc.\n\nSo at t=28, only safe to be on y=1,2,3 or not on freeway, but y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut at that time, I might be on y=3 as above.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=4 at t=30 with only one stay or something.\n\nFrom start: at t=24, I could stay at y=0 or go down, but that might waste time.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 at t=24, but y=0 is safe, no cars, but then I go up later.\n\nBut that would delay everything.\n\nFor instance, a24=S → t=25 y=0\n\nThen a25=U → t=26 y=1, etc., but now I reach y=3 later, say at t=29 or something, then to y=4 at t=30, same as before but started later, worse.\n\na24=S → t=25 y=0\n\na25=U → t=26 y=1\n\na26=U → t=27 y=2\n\na27=U → t=28 y=3\n\na28=S → t=29 y=3? Then a29=U → t=30 y=4 same as before but I reached y=3 at t=28 instead of t=27, so one turn later.\n\nIn first plan, I was at y=3 at t=27, here at t=28, so I need to stay at y=3 only once? Let's see.\n\nIn this: at t=28, y=3 (after a27=U from y=2 at t=27? t=27 y=2, go U to y=3 at t=28.\n\nAt t=28, y=3, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=4 at t=30? But at t=28, y=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=29, but t=29 occ for y=4.\n\nSo I must stay or go down.\n\nIf stay, a28=S → t=29 y=3\n\nThen a29=U → t=30 y=4\n\nSame as before, but now actions: t=24 S, t=25 U, t=26 U, t=27 U, t=28 S, t=29 U, then same from y=4.\n\nCompared to first plan: first plan had a24 U, a25 U, a26 U, a27 S, a28 S, a29 U, ...\n\nHere: a24 S, a25 U, a26 U, a27 U, a28 S, a29 U, ...\n\nIn both, I have two S actions, and reach y=9 at t=35.\n\nIn first: actions at t=24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34 → 11 actions.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nCan I avoid one stay?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 at t=30 without two stays.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=27, to be at y=4 at t=30, I need to spend two turns at y=3 or go down and come back.\n\nBut going down would take more turns.\n\nFor instance, at t=27, y=3, go D to y=2 at t=28.\n\ny=2 at t=28 safe.\n\nThen at t=28, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at t=29.\n\ny=3 at t=29 safe.\n\nThen at t=29, y=3, go U to y=4 at t=30.\n\nBut now I used three actions to go from y=3 to y=4: D, then U to y=3, then U to y=4, whereas staying at y=3 for two turns also takes two actions to be at y=4 at t=30.\n\nIn terms of time, from t=27 y=3 to t=30 y=4, I need three turns: t=27 action to set t=28 position, etc.\n\nAt t=27, I choose action, which affects t=28 position.\n\nTo have y=4 at t=30, I need to be at y=3 or y=4 or y=5 at t=29? At t=29, position y_{29}, then action a29 determines y_{30}.\n\nTo have y_{30}=4, I need y_{29}=3,4, or5, and choose action accordingly.\n\nBut I want y_{30}=4.\n\nIn this case, since I was at y=3 at t=27, I can stay at y=3 for t=28 and t=29, then go to y=4 at t=30.\n\nOr go down to y=2 at t=28, then to y=3 at t=29, then to y=4 at t=30, same number of turns but moved down and up, no gain.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nThus minimal seems to be H=11 with two stays at y=3.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=4 later, but y=4 is safe at t=30 to 35, so t=30 is earliest.\n\nThen from there, I go up each turn to y=8 at t=34, y=9 at t=35.\n\nt=34 y=8, go U to y=9 at t=35.\n\nNow, at t=34, y=8, is it safe? y=8 occ at 24 and 28, not 34, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have y=5 at t=31, which is fine.\n\nAnother thing: at t=28, I am at y=3, but y=3 is safe, but I could be doing something else.\n\nSince y=5 to y=8 have occ only at t=24 and t=28, and t=24 is past, t=28 is the only critical point.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=28, I am at y=3, not on y=5-8, so safe.\n\nCould I be on y=4 at t=28? But t=28 occ, not possible.\n\nOr y=2, etc.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after y=4.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=30, to y=5 at t=31, etc., up to y=9 at t=35, that's 5 turns for 5 levels? y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps: y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt t=30 y=4, t=31 y=5, t=32 y=6, t=33 y=7, t=34 y=8, t=35 y=9, yes.\n\nMinimal since I have to go through each.\n\nBut I started from y=0 at t=24 to y=3 at t=27, that's 3 turns for 3 levels, then stayed 2 turns, then 5 turns to y=9, total 10 actions? Let's count actions.\n\nFrom t=24 to t=34: actions at 11 times: t=24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at t=35.\n\nNumber of actions H=11.\n\nThe sequence has 11 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can save a turn by not staying twice.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 at t=30 but with only one delay.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=27, if I go directly to y=4 at t=28, occ; at t=29, occ; so impossible to be on y=4 before t=30 without collision.\n\nThus, must have y=4 at t=30 or later.\n\nt=30 is possible with two stays or equivalent.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is safe at t=30-35, and I need to pass it, but also, for the higher freeways, I need to avoid t=28.\n\nBut in my sequence, I am on y=5-8 after t=28, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=4 earlier if I start later, but that would be worse.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn: a24=S → t=25 y=0\n\nThen a25=U → t=26 y=1\n\na26=U → t=27 y=2\n\na27=U → t=28 y=3\n\nThen at t=28, y=3, I need to go to y=4 at t=30, so stay at y=3: a28=S → t=29 y=3\n\na29=U → t=30 y=4\n\nThen same as before, but now I reached y=3 at t=28 instead of t=27, so I have one less action before, but I added a stay at y=0.\n\nActions: t=24 S, t=25 U, t=26 U, t=27 U, t=28 S, t=29 U, t=30 U, ..., to t=34 U to y=9 at t=35.\n\nStill 11 actions: t=24 to t=34, 11 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had actions at t=24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.\n\nIn this, t=24 S, t=25 U, t=26 U, t=27 U, t=28 S, t=29 U, t=30 U, etc., so still 11.\n\nNo saving.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to avoid the occupancy, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=27, y=3, go D to y=2 at t=28.\n\nThen at t=28, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=3 at t=29, y=3 safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=30, y=4 safe.\n\nBut now from y=3 to y=2 to y=3 to y=4, three actions to gain one level, whereas staying at y=3 for two actions to stay then go up gains one level in two actions? From t=27 y=3, after two actions: if I do S then U, at t=29 y=4? No.\n\nAt t=27, action a27=S, then t=28 y=3\n\na28=U, then t=29 y=4? But y=4 at t=29 occ, not safe.\n\nIn the safe way, I need to go at t=30.\n\nSo at t=27 y=3, a27=S → t=28 y=3\n\na28=S → t=29 y=3\n\na29=U → t=30 y=4\n\nThree actions to be at y=4 at t=30, starting from y=3 at t=27.\n\nIf I go down: a27=D → t=28 y=2\n\na28=U → t=29 y=3\n\na29=U → t=30 y=4, same three actions to y=4 at t=30.\n\nNo gain.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states at the times.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=24: y=0, no collision\n\na24=U → t=25 y=1\n\nt=25: y=1, T=25, occ for y=1 at 40-43, not 25, safe.\n\na25=U → t=26 y=2\n\nt=26: y=2, T=26, not occ (occ 40-43), safe.\n\na26=U → t=27 y=3\n\nt=27: y=3, T=27, not occ (occ 40-43), safe.\n\na27=S → t=28 y=3\n\nt=28: y=3, T=28, not occ for y=3, safe.\n\na28=S → t=29 y=3\n\nt=29: y=3, T=29, safe.\n\na29=U → t=30 y=4\n\nt=30: y=4, T=30, is it safe? y=4 occ at 27,28,29,36,37,38. T=30 not in, and safe at 30-35, yes.\n\na30=U → t=31 y=5\n\nt=31: y=5, T=31, occ at 24,28, not 31, safe.\n\na31=U → t=32 y=6\n\nt=32: y=6, T=32, occ at 24,28, not 32, safe.\n\na32=U → t=33 y=7\n\nt=33: y=7, T=33, safe.\n\na33=U → t=34 y=8\n\nt=34: y=8, T=34, occ at 24,28, not 34, safe.\n\na34=U → t=35 y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, H=11, actions from t=24 to t=34.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turns t=24 to t=34.\n\nBut t=34 is the last action, after which at t=35 y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t= t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nH=11, so actions for t=24 to 24+10=34? t1=24, actions from t=24 to t=24 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=24 + H.\n\nWe want position at t=24 + H to be 9.\n\nIn this case, at t=35, y=9, so t=24 + H =35, H=11.\n\nActions at t=24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.\n\nSo the turns: t1=24, t1+1=25, ..., up to t1+10=34.\n\nNow, the actions: as above.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t1: a_{t1} = U (since a24=U)\n\nTurn t1+1: a25=U\n\n...\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nAfter turn 34 action, at turn 35, y=9.\n\nIs there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at a later safe time, but that would be worse.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=4 at t=35, but then I have to go up to y=9, which takes more turns.\n\nt=35 y=4, then to y=9 at t=40, worse.\n\nSo t=30 is better.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some freeway or something, but no, I have to go through each y from 0 to 9, but y=0 and 9 safe, but freeways 1-8 must be crossed.\n\nI could go down to y=0 and wait, but that increases time.\n\nFor example, at t=27, y=3, go D to y=2 at t=28, but then I need to come back up.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can be on y=4 at t=30 with only one extra action.\n\nFor that, I need to be at y=3 at t=29, then go U to y=4 at t=30.\n\nBut to be at y=3 at t=29, I need to start later or something.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nStart: a24=U → t=25 y=1\n\na25=U → t=26 y=2\n\nNow at t=26, y=2, instead of going up, I stay: a26=S → t=27 y=2\n\nThen a27=U → t=28 y=3\n\nAt t=28, y=3, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=4 at t=30.\n\nAt t=28, y=3, if I go U to y=4 at t=29, occ.\n\nSo I must stay: a28=S → t=29 y=3\n\nThen a29=U → t=30 y=4\n\nNow, sequence: t=24 U, t=25 U, t=26 S, t=27 U, t=28 S, t=29 U, t=30 U, etc.\n\nCompared to original: original had t=24 U,25 U,26 U,27 S,28 S,29 U,30 U,...\n\nHere: t=24 U,25 U,26 S,27 U,28 S,29 U,30 U,...\n\nStill two S actions, same number.\n\nReach y=9 same time.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 4, there was a car (24,13,right,4), but I thought it doesn't affect, but let me confirm.\n\nFor k=4, car (24,13,right,4) at t1=24, span [13,24], at T, [13+4(T-24), 24+4(T-24)], min at T=24 is 13>0, increasing, so 0 never in, so yes, not occupied except for the other cars.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=30, y=4, T=30, for the first car: min=-59+4(6)= -59+24? T-24=6, min=-59+24? 4*6=24, -59+24=-35, max=-48+24=-24, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: min=-23+4*6=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nThird car min=13+24=37>0, not.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nAt t=28, for example, but I was not on y=4 then.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, with the sequence as above.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n}\n\nBut the turns are from t1 to t1+H-1, which is 24 to 34.\n\nAnd actions.\n\nIn the box, it should be as specified.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5 to 8, there are two cars, but I think I covered.\n\nFor example, at t=31, y=5, T=31, for k=5, cars: first car span at T=31: [-59 +12(7), -48 +12(7)] T-24=7, min=-59+84=25, max=-48+84=36, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: min=-11+12*7=-11+84=73, max=84, not 0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid the occupied times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway \\(y=4\\) is occupied at turns \\(T = 27, 28, 29, 36, 37, 38\\), so the player must be on \\(y=4\\) at a safe time, such as \\(T = 30\\).\n- Freeways \\(y=5\\) to \\(y=8\\) are occupied at \\(T = 24\\) and \\(T = 28\\), so the player must avoid being on these freeways at those times.\n- Freeways \\(y=1\\) to \\(y=3\\) are occupied at \\(T = 40\\) to \\(43\\), which are later than the relevant turns, so they are safe during the sequence.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 24 with the player at \\(y=0\\). The actions are chosen as follows:\n- At turn 24, move up to \\(y=1\\) at turn 25 (safe, as \\(y=1\\) is not occupied at \\(T=25\\)).\n- At turn 25, move up to \\(y=2\\) at turn 26 (safe).\n- At turn 26, move up to \\(y=3\\) at turn 27 (safe).\n- At turn 27, stay to remain at \\(y=3\\) at turn 28 (to avoid moving to \\(y=4\\) at turn 28, which is occupied).\n- At turn 28, stay to remain at \\(y=3\\) at turn 29 (to avoid moving to \\(y=4\\) at turn 29, which is occupied).\n- At turn 29, move up to \\(y=4\\) at turn 30 (safe, as \\(y=4\\) is not occupied at \\(T=30\\)).\n- From turn 30 to turn 34, move up each turn to reach \\(y=9\\) at turn 35. Freeways \\(y=5\\) to \\(y=8\\) are safe at these times (not occupied at \\(T=30\\) to \\(34\\)).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y=9\\) in 11 actions, with the position at turn 35 being \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: S \\\\\nTurn 28: S \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=28, and I have the positions and movements of the cars on each freeway.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given the head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t=28. I need to compute where they are at future turns to avoid the player being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nA collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is within its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn 28, and for future turns, I can compute them based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway at t=28:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -36, tail -47, right, speed 3. Since it's moving right, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? No, the notation says for left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], and for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]. Let me read carefully.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t1) is given as [τ, h], meaning τ is the left end, h is the right end? But in the freeway 1 entry, it says \"(-36, -47, right, 3)\". I think the first number is head, second is tail.\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36], I assume, meaning from left to right.\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], with h left, τ right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIf it's moving left, decreasing x, so h and τ both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt], so τ is left, h is right.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head might be the front when moving right, so if moving right, head is at higher x.\n\nIn freeway 1: head = -36, tail = -47, both negative, and moving right, so since moving right, head should be at the right end.\n\nAt t=28, for right-moving car, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36], so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] with head left, tail right, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except... let's see the data.\n\nAll cars listed are right-moving; no left-moving mentioned.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 have two each, right-moving.\n\nBut for freeway 1,2,3: each has one car: (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-32,-43,right,4), (4,-7,right,4), (40,29,right,4) — head 40, tail 29? That would imply tail > head if both positive? 29 to 40, but tail=29, head=40, so if right-moving, span [τ,h] = [29,40]? But it says (40,29), so head=40, tail=29, and since right-moving, τ=tail=29, h=head=40, so span [29,40].\n\nSimilarly, the first one: (-32,-43,right,4), head=-32, tail=-43, so τ=-43, h=-32, span [-43,-32].\n\nSecond one: (4,-7,right,4), head=4, tail=-7, so τ=-7, h=4, span [-7,4].\n\nThird: (40,29,right,4), head=40, tail=29, so τ=29, h=40, span [29,40].\n\nNow freeway 5: (0,-11,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed 12. So at t=28, span [τ,h] = [-11,0].\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed 12, span [37,48].\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, same as 5: each has two cars, one with head=0, tail=-11, speed 12, and one with head=48, tail=37, speed 12. But head=0 and tail=37? No, for each, it's (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12).\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at t=28.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so probably I should move up most of the time, but I have to avoid being at a y where a car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince moving up takes at least 6 turns (from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so min 6 actions of U, but I might need to wait or something).\n\nWith only U actions, it would take exactly 6 turns to reach y=9: from t=28 to t=33, y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=33? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nStart: t=28, y=3.\n\nAfter action a_{28}, at t=29, y_{29} = y_{28} + Δy, depending on a_{28}.\n\nSimilarly, after H turns, at turn t=28 + H, y_{28+H} is set, and we want y_{28+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=28 to t=28+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t=28+H, position is y_{28+H}.\n\nWe want y_{28+H} =9, and minimize H.\n\nActions a_t for t=28 to 28+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn 28+H.\n\nFor example, if I do U at t=28, then at t=29, y=4.\n\nIf I do U at t=29, at t=30, y=5, and so on.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=9, I need to increase y by 6, so minimum H=6 if I do U every turn.\n\nBut I might collide with cars, so I need to check for each turn and each y I'm on, whether at that turn, for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nIf I go directly up, I will be on y=3 at t=28, but at t=28, I'm already there, and we need to start from action at t=28, but the position is given at t=28 before action, I think.\n\nThe player position is given at (0,3) at turn t=28, which is before we take action for this turn.\n\nThen we take action a_{28}, which affects y_{29}, and so on.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn based on the position at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T), and for freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nFor turn t=28, I am at y=3, so I need to check if at t=28, on y=3, is there a car at x=0.\n\nFreeway y=3: looking at the car state, for freeway 3, it has one car: (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nAt t=28, span for this car: since right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at t=28.\n\nIs 0 in [-47, -36]? No, -36 to -47 is from -47 to -36, so x from -47 to -36, 0 is not in there. So no collision at t=28 on y=3.\n\nNow, if I take action, say U, then at t=29, I will be at y=4.\n\nBut I need to check for each future turn where I am.\n\nFirst, let's plan a path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T, and for each turn from 28 to T-1, no collision when I'm on that y.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and I need to be at y=9, I must pass through y=4,5,6,7,8,9, but I can stay or move down, but that would take more turns, so to minimize H, I should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nThe minimal path is to go up directly, but I need to avoid turns where on that y, at that turn, there is a car at x=0.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car at x=0.\n\nBut only for the freeways I might be on, but since I don't know the path, I need to find a sequence.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to compute for each turn the state.\n\nFirst, let's define Δt = T - 28, so at turn T = 28 + τ, for τ >=0.\n\nAt turn 28 + τ, for a car on freeway k, with initial span at t=28.\n\nFor each car, at turn T, span depends on direction and speed.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=3, span at t=28: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt turn T, span = [ -47 + 3(τ), -36 + 3(τ) ] where τ = T-28\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, car (-36,-47,right,3), so identical.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-36,-47,right,3), identical.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4), so at t=28, span [ -43, -32 ]\n\nAt T, [ -43 + 4(τ), -32 + 4(τ) ]\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4), head=4, tail=-7, so span at t=28: [ -7, 4 ]\n\nAt T, [ -7 + 4(τ), 4 + 4(τ) ]\n\nThird car: (40,29,right,4), head=40, tail=29, span [29,40] at t=28, at T [29 + 4(τ), 40 + 4(τ)]\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (0,-11,right,12), so head=0, tail=-11, span at t=28: [ -11, 0 ]\n\nAt T, [ -11 + 12(τ), 0 + 12(τ) ]\n\nSecond: (48,37,right,12), span [37,48] at t=28, at T [37 + 12(τ), 48 + 12(τ)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8: each has the same as freeway 5: one car with span [-11,0] at t=28, and one with [37,48] at t=28, both speed 12.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, on freeway y, if y is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nThat is, for some car on y, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nNow, since the player is at x=0 always, we care about when 0 is covered by a car's span.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I can find when a car is at x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so if any car has 0 in span at T, then collision if player on that y at T.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, span at T: [ -47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ ] where τ = T-28\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max: -47 + 3τ <= 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nFrom 0 <= -36 + 3τ, so 3τ >= 36, τ >= 12\n\nFrom -47 + 3τ <= 0, 3τ <= 47, τ <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so τ <= 15 since integer? τ integer, T integer.\n\nτ = T-28, integer.\n\nSo -47 + 3τ <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/3 = 15 + 2/3, so τ <= 15\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 3τ => 36 <= 3τ => τ >= 12\n\nSo for τ =12,13,14,15\n\nAt τ=12: min = -47 + 3*12 = -47 + 36 = -11, max = -36 + 36 =0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=13: min=-47+39=-8, max=-36+39=3, [-8,3], 0 in.\n\nτ=14: min=-47+42=-5, max=-36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=15: min=-47+45=-2, max=-36+45=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nτ=16: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not >=1, so not included.\n\nSimilarly, τ=11: min=-47+33=-14, max=-36+33=-3, [-14,-3], 0 not <= -3? -3 to -14, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car at x=0 when τ=12,13,14,15, i.e., T=40,41,42,43.\n\nT=28+τ, so T=40,41,42,43.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 are identical, so same times: occupied at T=40,41,42,43.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: at T, span [ -43 + 4τ, -32 + 4τ ]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -43 +4τ <=0 <= -32 +4τ\n\nFirst, 0 <= -32 +4τ => 4τ >=32 => τ >=8\n\nSecond, -43 +4τ <=0 => 4τ <=43 => τ <= 10.75, so τ <=10\n\nτ integer, τ >=8 and τ <=10.\n\nτ=8: min=-43+32=-11, max=-32+32=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=9: min=-43+36=-7, max=-32+36=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=10: min=-43+40=-3, max=-32+40=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=11: min=-43+44=1, max=-32+44=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo first car occupies x=0 at T=28+8=36, T=37,38? τ=8,9,10 → T=36,37,38.\n\nT=28+τ, τ=8,9,10 → T=36,37,38.\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: span at T: [ -7 +4τ, 4 +4τ ]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -7 +4τ <=0 <= 4 +4τ\n\n0 <= 4 +4τ always true for τ>=0.\n\n-7 +4τ <=0 => 4τ <=7 => τ <= 7/4=1.75, so τ <=1\n\nτ integer, τ=0 or τ=1? τ=0: T=28, min=-7, max=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=1: T=29, min=-7+4=-3, max=4+4=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=2: min=-7+8=1, max=4+8=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo second car at x=0 for τ=0 and τ=1, i.e., T=28 and T=29.\n\nThird car: span [29 +4τ, 40 +4τ], min=29+4τ >0 for all τ>=0, so never at x=0.\n\nTherefore for freeway 4, occupied at x=0 when:\n\n- From second car: T=28,29\n\n- From first car: T=36,37,38\n\nT=28 and 29 from second car, T=36,37,38 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12), span at T: [ -11 +12τ, 0 +12τ ] = [ -11 +12τ, 12τ ]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -11 +12τ <=0 <= 12τ\n\n0 <= 12τ always true for τ>=0.\n\n-11 +12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <= 11/12 <1, so τ=0 only.\n\nτ=0: min=-11, max=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=1: min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=0, T=28.\n\nSecond car: [37 +12τ, 48 +12τ], min=37+12τ >=37>0 for all τ, never at x=0.\n\nTherefore for freeway 5, occupied only at T=28 by first car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8: each has the same cars as freeway 5.\n\nFor freeway 6: same, occupied at T=28.\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=28.\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=28.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when x=0 is occupied (collision possible if player on that y):\n\n- y=1: occupied at T=40,41,42,43\n\n- y=2: same, T=40,41,42,43\n\n- y=3: same, T=40,41,42,43\n\n- y=4: occupied at T=28,29 (from second car), and T=36,37,38 (from first car)\n\n- y=5: occupied at T=28\n\n- y=6: occupied at T=28\n\n- y=7: occupied at T=28\n\n- y=8: occupied at T=28\n\nAlso, for y=4, at T=28 and 29, and 36,37,38.\n\nNow, player starts at t=28, y=3.\n\nAt t=28, on y=3: is it occupied? From above, y=3 occupied only at T=40,41,42,43, not at t=28. So safe.\n\nBut at t=28, on y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but player is not on them.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are no cars on y=9, since freeways only y=1 to 8, so y=9 is always safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=3 and go up, so y=0 not relevant.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf I go straight up with U each turn:\n\nStart: t=28, y=3 (safe)\n\nAction a28: U, then t=29, y=4\n\nBut at t=29, y=4 is occupied? From above, y=4 occupied at T=28,29,36,37,38.\n\nAt T=29, occupied, so if I am on y=4 at t=29, collision.\n\nIf I do U at t=28, to go to y=4 at t=29, but at t=29, on y=4, which is occupied, so collision.\n\nIf I do S at t=28, stay at y=3 at t=29? No.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position at t+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the player position is y_T.\n\nWe take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nFor turn T=28: y=3, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen I take action a28.\n\nIf a28 = U, then y29 = 4.\n\nAt turn T=29, position y=4, and we check collision on y=4 at t=29.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied at t=29, so collision occurs at t=29.\n\nIf a28 = S, then y29 = 3 (same y), at t=29 position y=3, which is safe at t=29? y=3 occupied only at T=40-43, not at 29, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if a28 = D, y29=2, but y=2 might be safe now, but going down not helpful.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=29 on y=4.\n\nIf I don't go to y=4 at t=29, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince y=4 is occupied at t=28 and t=29, and also at 36-38, but t=28 and 29 are early.\n\nAt t=28, y=4 is occupied, but player is not on it.\n\nAt t=29, if I move to y=4, I am on it when occupied.\n\nBut I can delay moving to y=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied only at t=28, so after t=28, they are safe, except for later times on some.\n\ny=5: occupied only at T=28, so for T>28, no car at x=0 on y=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8: only at T=28 occupied, so for T>=29, no car at x=0, so safe to be on them after t=28.\n\ny=1,2,3 are safe until t=40, occupied from t=40.\n\ny=4 occupied at t=28,29 and t=36,37,38.\n\nNow, I am at t=28 on y=3, safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nIf I can go to y=4 after t=29, when it is safe until t=36.\n\ny=4 is occupied only at t=28,29 and 36,37,38, so for t from 30 to 35, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 are safe for all t except t=28, but since t=28 passed, for t>=29, they are safe.\n\ny=5 occupied only at t=28, so for t=29,30,... safe.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nNow, y=1,2,3 safe until t=39, since occupied at t=40-43.\n\nt=40 to 43 occupied.\n\nSo for y=3, safe for t=28 to 39.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nAt t=28, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to choose action a28.\n\nIf I do U, go to y=4 at t=29, but at t=29, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I do S, stay at y=3 at t=29, which is safe.\n\nIf I do D, go to y=2 at t=29.\n\ny=2 at t=29: is it occupied? y=2 occupied only at t=40-43, not now, so safe.\n\nBut going down not efficient.\n\nSo probably S or U, but U causes collision, so I should do S at t=28 to stay at y=3 for t=29.\n\nThen at t=29, position y=3 (if I did S at t=28).\n\nThen I take action a29.\n\nNow at t=29, I can do U to go to y=4 at t=30.\n\nAt t=30, y=4: is it occupied? y=4 occupied at t=28,29,36,37,38.\n\nt=30 not in that list, so safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 are all safe after t=28.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\n- t=28: since going U would put me at y=4 at t=29 when occupied, I should do S at t=28, so at t=29, still y=3, safe.\n\n- Then at t=29, I do U, so at t=30, y=4, which is safe (t=30 not occupied).\n\n- Then at t=30, I do U, to y=5 at t=31.\n\n- t=31, y=5, safe (only occupied at t=28, passed).\n\n- t=31, do U, to y=6 at t=32.\n\n- t=32, y=6, safe.\n\n- t=32, do U, to y=7 at t=33.\n\n- t=33, y=7, safe.\n\n- t=33, do U, to y=8 at t=34.\n\n- t=34, y=8, safe.\n\n- t=34, do U, to y=9 at t=35.\n\nAt t=35, y=9, which is the target, and safe.\n\nNow, what about y=4 at later times? I was on y=4 at t=30, which is fine.\n\nAnd y=9 at t=35.\n\nNow, H is the number of actions from t=28 to t=28+H-1, and at t=28+H, position.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nt=28: S\n\nt=29: U\n\nt=30: U\n\nt=31: U\n\nt=32: U\n\nt=33: U\n\nt=34: U\n\nAfter a34 at t=34, y35=9.\n\nSo actions from t=28 to t=34, that's 7 actions: t=28,29,30,31,32,33,34.\n\nH=7, and at t=28+7=35, y=9.\n\nt=28+H, position after H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 28+H.\n\nHere, after 7 actions, at t=35, y=9.\n\nMinimal possible is 6, but with direct U from t=28, I would be at y=4 at t=29, collision, so not possible.\n\nCould I go faster by going down or something? No, that would take more turns.\n\nPerhaps skip some levels, but I have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5-8 are safe after t=28, I could go directly to them, but I start from y=3, so I need to go through y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is only dangerous at t=28,29 and t=36-38.\n\nt=36-38 are later, but I can go to y=4 early or late.\n\nIn my plan, I go to y=4 at t=30, which is safe.\n\nCould I go to y=4 at t=28 or 29? But at t=28, I am at y=3, not y=4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=28, I would have to be there before, but I start at t=28 at y=3.\n\nAt t=28, position y=3.\n\nIf I want to be at y=4 at t=29, but as we saw, occupied.\n\nAt t=30, safe.\n\nSo I must avoid being on y=4 at t=29.\n\nThus, I need to delay.\n\nWith S at t=28, I stay at y=3 for t=29, then move up.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can do it in 6.\n\nSuppose I do something else.\n\nFor example, at t=28, I do D to y=2 at t=29.\n\nThen at t=29, y=2, which is safe (occupied only later).\n\nThen at t=29, I do U to y=3 at t=30? From y=2, U to y=3 at t=30.\n\nThen at t=30, y=3, safe.\n\nThen I can go up: U to y=4 at t=31.\n\nt=31, y=4: is it occupied? y=4 occupied at t=36,37,38, not at t=31, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=32, and so on, to y=9 at t=35? Let's see:\n\nt=28: D → t=29 y=2\n\nt=29: U → t=30 y=3\n\nt=30: U → t=31 y=4\n\nt=31: U → t=32 y=5\n\nt=32: U → t=33 y=6\n\nt=33: U → t=34 y=7\n\nt=34: U → t=35 y=8\n\nt=35: U → t=36 y=9\n\nNow at t=36, y=9.\n\nBut this took more actions: from t=28 to t=35 actions, 8 actions to reach y=9 at t=36.\n\nWorse than previous.\n\nIn previous with S, I reached at t=35 with 7 actions.\n\nIn the first plan: t=28 S, t=29 U, t=30 U, t=31 U, t=32 U, t=33 U, t=34 U, then at t=35 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I go up faster but avoid the collision.\n\nFor example, at t=28, if I could go to y=5 directly, but I can only change by +1,0,-1 per turn.\n\nSo I must go through y=4 to reach y=5.\n\nAnd I cannot be on y=4 at t=29.\n\nSo I have to spend one turn not moving to y=4 at that time.\n\nThus, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let's check if at t=35, y=9 is fine, and no issues.\n\nIn the sequence, I was on:\n\nt=28: y=3\n\nt=29: y=3 (after S)\n\nt=30: y=4\n\nt=31: y=5\n\nt=32: y=6\n\nt=33: y=7\n\nt=34: y=8\n\nt=35: y=9\n\nNow, check collision at each turn:\n\nt=28: y=3, not occupied (only at 40-43)\n\nt=29: y=3, same, not occupied\n\nt=30: y=4, occupied only at 28,29,36,37,38; t=30 not, so safe\n\nt=31: y=5, occupied only at t=28, not now, safe\n\nt=32: y=6, occupied only t=28, safe\n\nt=33: y=7, occupied only t=28, safe\n\nt=34: y=8, occupied only t=28, safe\n\nt=35: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, what about the later occupations, like y=4 at t=36, but I'm not on it, fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=1-3 at t=40, not relevant.\n\nSo this should work with H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6?\n\nSuppose I do U at t=28 to y=4 at t=29, but collision, not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a different y at t=29.\n\nBut if I do S, I stay y=3.\n\nIf I do D, I go to y=2, then I need to come back, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, t=28 D → t=29 y=2\n\nt=29 U → t=30 y=3\n\nt=30 U → t=31 y=4\n\nthen to y=5 at t=32, y=6 t=33, y=7 t=34, y=8 t=35, y=9 t=36, which is later.\n\nt=28 S → t=29 y=3\n\nt=29 U → t=30 y=4\n\netc., to y=9 at t=35.\n\nI think 7 is minimal.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go to y=4 at t=28, but I start at y=3, so I cannot be at y=4 at t=28.\n\nPosition is given at t=28 as (0,3), so I am at y=3 at t=28.\n\nNo action before.\n\nSo I think H=7 is the min.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions from t=28 to t=34.\n\nt=28: S\n\nt=29: U\n\nt=30: U\n\nt=31: U\n\nt=32: U\n\nt=33: U\n\nt=34: U\n\nThen at t=35, y=9.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, H=7.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=28.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 35, position (0,9), reached.\n\nAnd we have 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a sequence with 6 actions? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can move to y=4 later, but since I need to go up, and y=4 must be traversed, and the only dangerous times are early and late, but early I avoid by waiting, late I can avoid by going early.\n\nIn this case, with waiting one turn, I go through safely.\n\nIf I don't wait, I collide.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother point: at t=34, I go to y=8 to y=9 at t=35.\n\ny=8 at t=34: is it safe? Yes, only occupied at t=28.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 8, at t=28 occupied, but t=34 is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut the sequence has actions from t=28 to t=34, that's 7 actions.\n\nt=28,29,30,31,32,33,34.\n\nNow, write:\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nAnd that should do.\n\nBut let's double-check the car on y=4 at t=36-38, but I'm not on it, fine.\n\nAlso, for y=3, I was on it at t=28 and 29, but safe at those times.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving up immediately but skip the collision.\n\nFor example, if at t=28 I do U, but collision at t=29, so no.\n\nUnless I move to y=4 at a different time, but I can't control the time except by waiting.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 7.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 28\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\n- **Freeway 1, 2, 3**: Occupied at turns 40, 41, 42, 43.\n- **Freeway 4**: Occupied at turns 28, 29 (from the second car) and turns 36, 37, 38 (from the first car).\n- **Freeway 5, 6, 7, 8**: Occupied only at turn 28 (from the first car with span [-11, 0] at turn 28).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Strategy\n- At turn 28, the player is at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe (not occupied at turn 28).\n- Moving up (U) at turn 28 would place the player at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 29, but \\(y = 4\\) is occupied at turn 29, causing a collision.\n- Staying (S) at turn 28 keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 29, which is safe.\n- From turn 29 onwards:\n  - \\(y = 4\\) is safe for turns 30 to 35 (not occupied except at 28, 29, 36, 37, 38).\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are safe for all turns after 28 (occupied only at turn 28).\n  - \\(y = 9\\) is always safe (no cars).\n- The player can then move up (U) consecutively from turn 29 to turn 34 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35.\n\n### Minimal Sequence of Actions\n- The sequence requires 7 actions (from turn 28 to turn 34), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35.\n- Attempting to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., 6 turns) is impossible because:\n  - Moving up at turn 28 causes a collision at turn 29 on \\(y = 4\\).\n  - Any deviation (e.g., moving down) increases the number of turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this with \\(H = 7\\) is:\n- Turn 28: S (stay to avoid collision at \\(y = 4\\) on turn 29)\n- Turn 29: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 30, safe)\n- Turn 30: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 31, safe)\n- Turn 31: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 32, safe)\n- Turn 32: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 33, safe)\n- Turn 33: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 34, safe)\n- Turn 34: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35, safe)\n\n### Verification\n- Turn 28: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 29: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 30: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, not occupied at turn 30)\n- Turn 31: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, not occupied after turn 28)\n- Turn 32: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, not occupied after turn 28)\n- Turn 33: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, not occupied after turn 28)\n- Turn 34: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, not occupied after turn 28)\n- Turn 35: \\(y = 9\\) (reached, safe)\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H = 7\\) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: S \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 34 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. I have to output the sequence of actions starting from turn 34.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. The cars are on specific freeways, and they move left or right with a certain speed. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: if I move to a different freeway at turn T, I'm not on that new freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm still on the previous freeway. Only when I'm actually on a freeway at a given turn do I need to worry about cars there.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so x is always 0, and y changes. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so when y_t is between 1 and 8, I'm on a freeway and need to avoid cars there.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, I assume there are no cars, since freeways are only y=1 to 8. The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at (0,0) at turn 34, and I need to reach (0,9). Since y=0 and y=9 are safe, I only need to worry about collisions when I'm on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves up, so H=9 if I go straight up with no delays. But I might have to wait or move down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nI need to find a path that avoids being on a freeway when a car is covering position 0 at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when cars are at position 0.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=34, and they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T0 = 34.\n\nFor each car, given its head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s at turn T0, I can find its position at any turn T.\n\nThe span is given as [h, tau] for left-moving or [tau, h] for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), tau - s(T - t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, Span is [tau, h] with tau < h, I assume, since it's the tail and head.\n\nIn the input, for right-moving cars, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span definition, for right-moving, they write [tau, h] for the initial span, which might imply tau is left, h is right.\n\nLet's see an example.\n\nFor freeway 4, there is (-48, -59, right, 4). But -48 and -59, if right-moving, and [tau, h], so tau = -59, h = -48? But it says (head, tail), so head is -48, tail is -59, but -48 > -59, so if right-moving, head should be to the right, so yes, head at -48, tail at -59, meaning the car extends from -59 to -48, so span is [-59, -48]? But in the definition, for right-moving, they write [tau, h] with tau + s(T-t1) etc.\n\nI think I need to interpret the (h, tau) given.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor a car, head and tail: I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor right-moving car, if it's moving right, head is on the right, tail on the left, so span from tail to head, with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, head on left, tail on right, so head < tail.\n\nIn the definition:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] with h and tau, and since left-moving, head is left, so h < tau, I think.\n\nLet's see the input.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\n-48 and -59, -48 > -59, so if right, head at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from -59 to -48, so span [-59, -48].\n\nBut in the definition for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [tau, h] → [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nHere tau = -59, h = -48, so at T, [ -59 + s(T-t1), -48 + s(T-t1) ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if it were, Span(t1) = [h, tau] → [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars given are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nAll directions are \"right\" in the input. Freeway 1,2,3: all right, 3. Freeway 4: three cars, all right, 4. Freeway 5,6,7,8: all right, 12, with two cars each.\n\nNo left-moving cars, all are right-moving.\n\nSo for all, direction is right.\n\nFor each car, given (head h, tail tau, right, s) with h > tau, since head is right of tail.\n\nAt turn T, span is [ tau + s(T - T0), h + s(T - T0) ] where T0 = 34.\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if the player is on y=k and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car on k, tau + s(T - 34) <= 0 <= h + s(T - 34)\n\nSince the span is [L, R] with L = tau + s(T-34), R = h + s(T-34), and 0 in [L,R].\n\nNow, since all cars are right-moving, and s positive.\n\nI need for each freeway, for each turn, whether position 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need to check if any car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, the player is on y_t at turn t.\n\nStart at t=34, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end, with y_{T_end} =9.\n\nMinimize the number of turns, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but may need to wait.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head -48, tail -59, right, 3)\n\nSo L(T) = -59 + 3(T - 34)\n\nR(T) = -48 + 3(T - 34)\n\n0 in [L,R] when L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48, -59, right, 3) identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 have the same car? Or each has its own car but same parameters.\n\nSince it's per freeway, and each has one car with same spec, so for each of y=1,2,3, the car behavior is identical.\n\nThen freeway 4: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\n(24, 13? Head 24, tail 13? 24>13, so for right-moving, tail 13, head 24, so from 13 to 24.\n\nBut in the list it says (head, tail), so for this car, head=24, tail=13.\n\nSimilarly, first car: head=-48, tail=-59? Earlier for freeway 1, it was head=-48, tail=-59, but here for freeway 4, first car is also (-48,-59,right,4), same as others but speed 4.\n\nLet's list clearly.\n\nFreeway 4 cars:\n\nCar 1: h=-48, tau=-59, d=right, s=4 → span at T: L = -59 + 4(T-34), R = -48 + 4(T-34)\n\nCar 2: h=-12, tau=-23, d=right, s=4 → L = -23 + 4(T-34), R = -12 + 4(T-34)\n\nCar 3: h=24, tau=13, d=right, s=4? (24,13,right,4) but 24 and 13, head=24, tail=13, so L = 13 + 4(T-34), R = 24 + 4(T-34)\n\nNow for freeway 5: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, tau=-59, s=12 → L = -59 +12(T-34), R = -48 +12(T-34)\n\nSecond car: h=0, tau=-11, s=12 → L = -11 +12(T-34), R = 0 +12(T-34) = 12(T-34)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5? (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 all have identical car setups: one car from -59 to -48 at speed 12, and one car from -11 to 0 at speed 12, but at turn 34.\n\nFor the second car on freeway 5 at T0: head=0, tail=-11, so at T0, position 0 is covered, since R=0, L=-11, so 0 is included.\n\nBut at turn 34, the player is at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision. But if I were on y=5 at turn 34, I would collide, but I'm not.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, when it is unsafe to be on that freeway.\n\nThat is, when 0 is covered by some car on that row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when it is occupied at position 0.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns, so for each integer turn T, check if 0 is in some span.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nStart from T=34 onwards.\n\nNow, freeway 1 (and similarly 2 and 3 since identical).\n\nCar: L(T) = -59 + 3(T-34)\n\nR(T) = -48 + 3(T-34)\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nL(T) <= 0: -59 + 3(T-34) <= 0 => 3(T-34) <= 59 => T-34 <= 59/3 = 19.666, so T-34 <= 19 since T integer, T <= 34+19=53\n\n0 <= R(T): 0 <= -48 + 3(T-34) => 48 <= 3(T-34) => T-34 >= 16, since 48/3=16, so T >= 34+16=50\n\nThus for T from 50 to 53 inclusive, 0 is covered on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3.\n\nNow freeway 4.\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above but speed 4: L = -59 +4(T-34), R= -48 +4(T-34)\n\n0 in [L,R]: L<=0 and 0<=R\n\nL<=0: -59 +4(T-34) <=0 => 4(T-34) <=59 => T-34 <= 14.75, T<=34+14=48? 59/4=14.75, so T-34 <=14.75, since T integer, T-34 <=14, T<=48\n\n0<=R: 0<= -48 +4(T-34) => 48 <=4(T-34) => 12 <= T-34, T>=46\n\nSo for first car, occupied when T from 46 to 48 inclusive? T>=46 and T<=48\n\nT-34 >=12, T>=46\n\nT-34 <=14.75, T<=48.75, so T<=48\n\nYes T=46,47,48\n\nNow second car on freeway 4: h=-12, tau=-23, s=4\n\nL = -23 +4(T-34)\n\nR = -12 +4(T-34)\n\n0 in [L,R]: L<=0 and 0<=R\n\nL<=0: -23 +4(T-34) <=0 => 4(T-34) <=23 => T-34 <= 23/4=5.75, T<=34+5=39? T-34 <=5.75, T<=39.75, so T<=39\n\n0<=R: 0<= -12 +4(T-34) => 12 <=4(T-34) => 3 <= T-34, T>=37\n\nSo T from 37 to 39 inclusive.\n\nNow third car on freeway 4: h=24, tau=13, s=4\n\nL = 13 +4(T-34)\n\nR = 24 +4(T-34)\n\n0 in [L,R]: L<=0 and 0<=R\n\nL=13 +4(T-34) >0 for all T>=34, since min at T=34 is 13>0, so L>0 always, thus 0 <= R is true but 0 < L? L min is 13>0, so 0 < L <= something, so 0 not in [L,R] since L>0. [L,R] starts at L>0, so 0 not in it.\n\nFor example at T=34, L=13, R=24, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nAs T increases, L and R increase, so always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nSo third car never covers 0.\n\nThus for freeway 4, occupied when either first or second car covers 0.\n\nFirst car: T=46,47,48\n\nSecond car: T=37,38,39\n\nSo unsafe at T=37,38,39,46,47,48\n\nNow freeway 5 (and similarly 6,7,8)\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-48, tau=-59, s=12\n\nL = -59 +12(T-34)\n\nR = -48 +12(T-34)\n\n0 in [L,R]: L<=0 and 0<=R\n\nL<=0: -59 +12(T-34) <=0 => 12(T-34) <=59 => T-34 <= 59/12 ≈4.916, T<=34+4=38? T-34 <=4.916, T<=38.916, so T<=38\n\n0<=R: 0<= -48 +12(T-34) => 48 <=12(T-34) => 4 <= T-34, T>=38\n\nSo L<=0 for T<=38, 0<=R for T>=38, so only at T=38, both true.\n\nAt T=38, L<=0 and 0<=R.\n\nAt T=37, L= -59 +12(3) = -59+36= -23 <=0, R= -48+36= -12 <0, so 0<=R false? 0 <= -12? False, so not occupied.\n\nAt T=38, L= -59 +12(4)= -59+48= -11 <=0, R= -48+48=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so yes, 0 in [L,R].\n\nAt T=39, L= -59 +12(5)= -59+60=1 >0, R= -48+60=12>0, L=1>0, so 0 not <= L? 0 < L, not in [1,12].\n\nSo only at T=38 for first car.\n\nNow second car on freeway 5: h=0, tau=-11, s=12\n\nL = -11 +12(T-34)\n\nR = 0 +12(T-34) = 12(T-34)\n\n0 in [L,R]: L<=0 and 0<=R\n\nL<=0: -11 +12(T-34) <=0 => 12(T-34) <=11 => T-34 <= 11/12 ≈0.916, T<=34.916, so since T>=34, T=34\n\n0<=R: 0 <= 12(T-34) always true for T>=34.\n\nAt T=34, L= -11 +12(0) = -11 <=0, R=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nFor T>34, L= -11 +12(T-34) > -11 +0 = -11, but since T>34, L increases, at T=35, L= -11+12=1>0, so not <=0.\n\nSo only at T=34, second car covers 0.\n\nThus for freeway 5, at T=34, second car covers 0, and at T=38, first car covers 0.\n\nSo unsafe at T=34 and T=38.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8, same thing, since identical.\n\nFreeway 6 has same cars, so unsafe at T=34 and T=38.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway the unsafe turns:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=50,51,52,53\n\ny=2: same, 50,51,52,53\n\ny=3: same, 50,51,52,53\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=37,38,39 and 46,47,48\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=34 and T=38\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=34 and T=38\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=34 and T=38\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=34 and T=38\n\nNow, the player starts at T=34, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway y at turn T when y is unsafe at that T.\n\nThat is, for each turn, if I am on y between 1 and 8, it must not be unsafe at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0, T=34, and I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nI want to minimize H, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe minimal H is 9 if I go straight up: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U from T=34 to T=42, reaching y=9 at T=43? Let's see.\n\nAt T=34, y=0\n\nAction at T=34: if I go U, then at T=35, y=1\n\nSimilarly, if I go U at T=34, y_{35} = y_{34} +1 =1\n\nThen at T=35, if U, y=2, and so on.\n\nAfter k up moves, y = k, at turn T=34 + k.\n\nStart: T=34, y=0\n\nAfter first U: T=35, y=1\n\nAfter second U: T=36, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter ninth U: T=43, y=9\n\nSo with 9 actions from T=34 to T=42, I reach y=9 at T=43.\n\nT=34: action a_{34}, then position at T=35 is y=0 + Δy\n\ny_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t=34, y=0\n\nAfter a_{34}, y_{35} = y_{34} + Δy_{34}\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo have y_{T} =9 for some T.\n\nMin T such that after H actions, at turn t=34 + H, y_{34+H} =9.\n\nWith H up moves, I can be at y=9 at turn 34+H.\n\nH min is 9.\n\nBut I need to check if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nSo let's simulate going straight up.\n\nT=34: y=0, safe\n\na_{34} = U, then y_{35} =1\n\nNow at T=35, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nIs y=1 unsafe at T=35? From above, y=1 unsafe only at T=50-53, so at T=35, safe. I can be there.\n\nSimilarly, T=36: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe only at 50-53, safe.\n\nT=37: y=3, freeway 3, same, safe.\n\nT=38: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nIs freeway 4 unsafe at T=38? Yes, from above, T=38 is unsafe for y=4, since 37,38,39 are unsafe.\n\nT=38 is in 37,38,39 for y=4.\n\nSo if I am on y=4 at T=38, I collide.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=34: y=0\n\na34=U, y35=1\n\na35=U, y36=2\n\na36=U, y37=3\n\na37=U, y38=4\n\nAt T=38, y=4, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go straight up because at T=38, I would be on y=4 which is occupied.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or move down.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe at T=34 and T=38, but at other times may be safe.\n\nT=34 is unsafe for y=5,6,7,8, but at T=34, I start at y=0, so I'm not on them, so no issue. Only when I move to them.\n\nNow, to avoid being on y=4 at T=38.\n\nI could, for example, stay at y=0 for one turn or something.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSince the problem is only at T=38 for y=4, and also other points.\n\nList the unsafe times per y.\n\ny=1: unsafe T=50-53\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: unsafe T=37,38,39,46,47,48\n\ny=5: unsafe T=34,38\n\ny=6: unsafe T=34,38\n\ny=7: unsafe T=34,38\n\ny=8: unsafe T=34,38\n\nT=34 unsafe for y=5-8, but at T=34, I'm at y=0, so I can go to y=1 at T=35, etc.\n\nNow, for y=5-8, they are only unsafe at T=34 and T=38, so for other times, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 is unsafe only at specific times.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to pass through each y from 1 to 8 at some point.\n\nBut I can stay or move down to avoid bad times.\n\nSince I want min H, I should go up as much as possible when safe.\n\nNow, the critical point is T=38 for multiple freeways.\n\nAt T=38, y=4 is unsafe, and also y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe.\n\ny=5-8 unsafe at T=38, and y=4 also unsafe at T=38.\n\nSo at T=38, all freeways y=4 to y=8 are unsafe! y=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe at T=38.\n\ny=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, etc.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 are safe at T=38, since unsafe only later.\n\nSo at T=38, if I am on y=1,2,3, it's safe, but if on y=4,5,6,7,8, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nIn the straight up path, I would be on y=4 at T=38, which is unsafe.\n\nI need to not be on y=4 to 8 at T=38.\n\nI could be on lower y or higher, but higher y I haven't reached yet.\n\nAt T=38, I could be on y=3 or lower, or y=9, but y=9 I reach later.\n\nSince I start at T=34 y=0, at T=38, I could be at y from 0 to 4, depending on actions.\n\nIf I go up every turn, y=4 at T=38.\n\nBut I can stay or go down to be lower.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nT=34: y=0, action S (stay), then y_{35}=0\n\nThen T=35: y=0, action U, y_{36}=1\n\nT=36: y=1, U, y_{37}=2\n\nT=37: y=2, U, y_{38}=3\n\nNow at T=38, y=3, which is freeway 3, and y=3 is safe at T=38, since unsafe only at 50-53.\n\nThen T=38: y=3, action U, y_{39}=4\n\nBut at T=39, y=4 is unsafe, since y=4 unsafe at T=39.\n\nT=39 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nIn this case, at T=39, y=4, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I stay longer.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=4 at T=37,38,39.\n\nT=37,38,39 all unsafe for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nBut y=4 is also unsafe at T=46,47,48, but that's later, I can be earlier or later.\n\nFor example, I could go up slowly or fast to hit y=4 when safe.\n\nWhen is y=4 safe?\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=37,38,39,46,47,48.\n\nSo safe when T<=36 or T=40 to 45 or T>=49? But T=34 to 36,40 to45,49 etc.\n\nBut I start from below, so I can be on y=4 early or late.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nNow, since y=5 to 8 are unsafe only at T=34 and T=38, so for example, I can be on y=5 at T=35,36,37,39,etc. except T=34 and T=38.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, back to min H.\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nStart T=34 y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=1, then y=2, etc.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is T=43 with 9 up moves, but we saw collision at T=38.\n\nIf I delay one turn, say stay at start.\n\nT=34: S, y=0\n\nT=35: y=0, U, y=1\n\nT=36: U, y=2\n\nT=37: U, y=3\n\nT=38: U, y=4 but T=38 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at T=37, I don't go up, but stay.\n\nT=34: U, y=1 at T=35\n\nT=35: U, y=2 at T=36\n\nT=36: U, y=3 at T=37\n\nT=37: y=3, action S (stay), so y_{38}=3\n\nAt T=38, y=3, which is safe, since y=3 unsafe only later.\n\nThen T=38: from y=3, I can go U to y=4 at T=39.\n\nBut at T=39, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nIf I go U at T=38, y_{39}=4, T=39 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 again at T=38, y_{39}=3? T=38 action S, y_{39}=3\n\nThen T=39: y=3, now go U to y=4 at T=40.\n\nAt T=40, y=4, is it safe? y=4 unsafe at 37,38,39,46,47,48, so at T=40, it is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nThen from there I can go up.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nT=34: y=0, action U, so y35=1\n\nT=35: y=1, action U, y36=2\n\nT=36: y=2, action U, y37=3\n\nT=37: y=3, action S (stay), so y38=3\n\nT=38: y=3, action S (stay again), so y39=3\n\nT=39: y=3, action U, y40=4\n\nNow at T=40, y=4, safe.\n\nThen T=40: U to y=5\n\nT=41: y=5, action U to y=6\n\nBut at T=41, y=5, is it safe? y=5 unsafe at T=34 and T=38, T=41 not 34 or 38, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=42: U to y=7, safe\n\nT=43: U to y=8, safe? y=8 unsafe at T=34 and T=38, T=43 not, so safe.\n\nT=44: U to y=9\n\nThen at T=44, y=9, reached.\n\nNow actions from T=34 to T=43? Let's list turns and actions.\n\nActions at turn t determine y_{t+1}\n\nStart: turn 34, position y=0\n\nAction a34: if U, y35=1\n\na35: if U, y36=2\n\netc.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\na34 = U  // y35=1\n\na35 = U  // y36=2\n\na36 = U  // y37=3\n\na37 = S  // y38=3 (since Δy=0)\n\na38 = S  // y39=3 (stay again)\n\na39 = U  // y40=4\n\na40 = U  // y41=5\n\na41 = U  // y42=6\n\na42 = U  // y43=7\n\na43 = U  // y44=8? y43=7, a43=U, y44=8\n\nThen a44=U, y45=9\n\nI have y44=8 at T=44, then a44=U to y45=9.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=34 to T=44, that's 11 actions? Turns: actions at T=34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nThat's 11 actions, reaching y=9 at T=45.\n\nBut earlier I thought min is 9, but with delay.\n\nIn this, I stayed twice at y=3.\n\nFrom T=37 to T=39, I was at y=3 for three turns? Let's see positions:\n\nT=34: y=0\n\nAfter a34=U: T=35 y=1\n\na35=U: T=36 y=2\n\na36=U: T=37 y=3\n\na37=S: T=38 y=3\n\na38=S: T=39 y=3\n\na39=U: T=40 y=4\n\na40=U: T=41 y=5\n\na41=U: T=42 y=6\n\na42=U: T=43 y=7\n\na43=U: T=44 y=8\n\na44=U: T=45 y=9\n\nSo H=11 actions, from t=34 to t=44, reach at t=45.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nSince y=4 is safe from T=40 to 45, I can go up faster earlier and slower later.\n\nFor example, go up to y=3 quickly, then wait, then go up.\n\ny=3 is always safe except T=50-53, which is late, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 safe always except late, so I can be there early.\n\nNow, y=5 to 8 are safe except T=34 and T=38, so I need to avoid T=38 for them.\n\nIn particular, at T=38, I should not be on y=4 to 8.\n\nSo I can be on y=0,1,2,3 at T=38.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, or y=1,2,3.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should go up as much as possible before and after.\n\nFor example, from T=34 to T=37, I can go up to y=3.\n\nT=34: U to y=1 at T=35\n\nT=35: U to y=2 at T=36\n\nT=36: U to y=3 at T=37\n\nNow at T=37, I am at y=3.\n\nT=37 is safe for y=3.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=4, but y=4 is unsafe at T=37,38,39.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=4 at T=38 or 39 directly.\n\nIf I go U at T=37, y38=4, but T=38 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at T=37, y38=3.\n\nThen at T=38, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=38, if I go U, y39=4, but T=39 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y39=3.\n\nThen at T=39, go U, y40=4, safe.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=3 for two turns: T=37 and T=38 actions S, so at T=39 y=3, then go U to y=4 at T=40.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut that takes time.\n\nCan I go to y=4 earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=36, I am at y=2 (after a35=U? Let's set timeline.\n\nT=34: start y=0\n\na34=U, T=35 y=1\n\na35=U, T=36 y=2\n\nNow at T=36, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at T=37, or stay, or down, but down not useful.\n\nIf I go U, to y=3 at T=37, same as before.\n\nFrom T=36, if I go directly to y=4? But to go from y=2 to y=4, I need two up moves, at T=36 and T=37.\n\na36=U, y37=3\n\na37=U, y38=4\n\nBut y38=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I go slower.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=3 by T=37, then since y=4 unsafe until T=40, but I can go to higher freeways earlier if possible.\n\nFor example, at T=36, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I go U, to y=3 at T=37.\n\nBut I could, for example, go to y=3 and then to y=4 at a safe time.\n\nBut the safe times for y=4 are T=40 to 45, etc.\n\nSince y=5 is safe at T=39, for example.\n\ny=5 unsafe only T=34 and T=38, so at T=39, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 safe at T=39.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=39, I need to have moved there.\n\nNow, at T=38, I need to be on y<=3.\n\nSo possible to be on y=3 at T=38.\n\nThen from there, at T=39, I can go to y=4, but y=4 is unsafe at T=39, so I cannot.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=39.\n\nBut y=5 is safe at T=39.\n\nIf I can jump from y=3 to y=5, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so I need to go through y=4.\n\nSo I must be on y=4 at some point.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=4 when it is safe, like T=40.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 earlier, but T=36 or before.\n\nFor example, at T=35: I can be at y=1 or other.\n\nLet's see when I can reach y=4.\n\nEarliest: if I go up all the way.\n\na34=U, y35=1\n\na35=U, y36=2\n\na36=U, y37=3\n\na37=U, y38=4 but unsafe.\n\nIf I go faster? I can only one step per turn, so cannot faster.\n\nLater: as before.\n\nAt T=34, I could go down, but y=0 is min, cannot go down, or stay.\n\nBut staying delays.\n\nAnother thought: since y=5 to 8 are safe except T=34 and T=38, I can be on them at T=39, for example.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=39, I need to have y=4 at T=38 or something.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=39, I must have been at y=4 at T=38, and action U at T=38.\n\nBut at T=38, if I am at y=4, and go U, but y=4 at T=38 is unsafe, so collision at T=38 when I am on y=4.\n\nEven if I go U, I am on y=4 at T=38 during the turn, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=4 at T=38, collision regardless of action.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at T=38.\n\nSimilarly for T=37 and T=39.\n\nSo I must avoid y=4 at T=37,38,39.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, I must avoid at T=34 and T=38.\n\nBut T=34 I start below, so not on y=5.\n\nNow, back to min H.\n\nWith the previous path, I have 11 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can save one turn.\n\nFor example, go up to y=3 faster? No.\n\nAt T=37, instead of staying, I could go down, but that seems worse.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 before T=37.\n\nBut T=37 is the earliest I can be at y=4? Let's see.\n\nStart T=34 y=0\n\nAfter one U: T=35 y=1\n\nAfter two U: T=36 y=2\n\nAfter three U: T=37 y=3\n\nAfter four U: T=38 y=4\n\nT=38 is the earliest for y=4, but unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at start: T=34 S, T=35 y=0, then U at T=35, T=36 y=1, U T=36, T=37 y=2, U T=37, T=38 y=3, then U T=38, T=39 y=4, but T=39 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=4 before T=40 safely, as in the first path.\n\nT=40 y=4.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=5 at T=41, y=6 at T=42, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=4 at T=40, I need 5 more up moves: to y=5 at T=41, y=6 T=42, y=7 T=43, y=8 T=44, y=9 T=45.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at T=38, I was at y=3, I did two stays.\n\nCan I do only one stay?\n\nFor example, at T=37, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I go U at T=37, y38=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=2 at T=38, but y=2 is safe at T=38, but then I have to go back up, which takes more time.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=37: y=3, action D, so y38=2\n\nThen at T=38, y=2, safe.\n\nThen T=38: action U, y39=3\n\nT=39: action U, y40=4\n\nNow y40=4, safe.\n\nThen same as before, from y=4 at T=40, up to y=9 at T=45.\n\nBut now I used a down move, so it took more actions: from T=37 to T=45, that's worse.\n\nActions: a37=D, a38=U, a39=U, etc., more than staying.\n\nStaying is better.\n\nSo the first path with two stays at y=3 seems efficient.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after passing y=4.\n\nAnother idea: after T=40, I am at y=4, then I go up, but y=5 to 8 have no other unsafe times except T=38, which is past, so I can go up fast.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, I need 5 up moves, 5 turns.\n\nStart to y=4 at T=40, so reach y=9 at T=45.\n\nBut I reached y=4 at T=40.\n\nHow to reach y=4 earlier? I cannot because of the unsafe times.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at T=36 or something, but let's see if possible.\n\nFor example, to be at y=4 at T=36.\n\nThat means y36=4.\n\nThen y35 must be 3 or 4 or 5, but since y35 from previous.\n\ny36=4, so at T=35, y=3,4, or5, and action.\n\nIf y35=3, action U to y36=4\n\nIf y35=4, action S to y36=4\n\nIf y35=5, action D to y36=4\n\nBut y35=4, at T=35, is it safe? y=4 unsafe at T=37,38,39, not T=35, so T=35 should be safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe only 37,38,39,46,47,48, so T=35 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=36 should be safe for y=4.\n\nBut can I reach y=4 by T=36?\n\nT=34 y=0\n\na34=U, y35=1\n\nThen a35=U, y36=2, not 4.\n\nTo reach y=4 at T=36, I need y36=4.\n\ny36 = y35 + Δy35\n\ny35 = y34 + Δy34\n\ny34=0\n\nIf Δy34=U, y35=1\n\nThen to have y36=4, from y35=1, I need Δy35= +3, but I can only change by +1,0,-1, so impossible to go from y=1 to y=4 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with S, y35=0, then y36=4 impossible.\n\nOr D, y35=-1? But y min 0, cannot go below.\n\ny_{t+1} in [0,9], so y=0 min.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 before T=38.\n\nEarliest possible y=4 is T=38 with four up moves.\n\nBut T=38 unsafe.\n\nNext is T=39 with, for example, stay or something, but T=39 also unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo earliest safe is T=40, as we have.\n\nThus, I must reach y=4 at T=40 or later.\n\nSimilarly, from there, min to y=9 is 5 up moves, at T=45.\n\nWith actions from T=34 to T=44.\n\nBut in the sequence, I had actions from T=34 to T=44 for 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by not staying twice.\n\nAnother thought: at T=38, instead of staying at y=3, I could be on a different y, but y=3 is fine.\n\nSince y=5 to 8 are safe at T=39, if I can be on y=4 at T=38, but I cannot.\n\nUnless I am on y=4 at T=38, but unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=5 from y=3 or something, but no.\n\nI think 11 is the min.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for other y.\n\nFor example, at T=41, when I go to y=5, is it safe? Yes, only unsafe at 34 and 38.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the path, when I go from y=4 to y=5 at T=41, etc., all safe.\n\nBut at T=46-48, y=4 is unsafe, but I will be past that by then.\n\nIn my path, at T=40 y=4, T=41 y=5, etc., by T=46, I am at y=9 or above, so fine.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence I have, I used two stays at T=37 and T=38.\n\nT=37 and T=38 actions S, while at y=3.\n\nBut y=3 is safe there.\n\nNow, can I use only one stay?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=3 earlier.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at T=37 with three up moves.\n\nIf I stay only one turn.\n\nSuppose at T=37, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I do S, then y38=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=38, I want to go to y=4, but cannot because y=4 unsafe at T=38 and T=39.\n\nIf at T=38, I go U to y=4 at T=39, unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=5 directly? No.\n\nAnother idea: at T=38, from y=3, I go U, but y38=4? No, action at T=38 affects y39.\n\nPosition at T=38 is y=3, action a38, then y39 = y38 + Δy.\n\nIf a38=U, y39=4.\n\nBut T=39 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf a38=S, y39=3.\n\nThen a39=U, y40=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf a38=D, y39=2, then I have to go back, worse.\n\nSo I need to stay at least one extra turn to avoid T=38 and T=39 for y=4.\n\nSince y=4 unsafe at T=37,38,39, I need to be on y=4 at T<=36 or T>=40.\n\nT=36: can I be at y=4 at T=36?\n\nAs before, impossible, since from T=34 y=0, at T=35 y<=1, T=36 y<=2.\n\nMax y at T=36 is 2, with two up moves.\n\ny36 <=2.\n\nSimilarly, T=37 y<=3, T=38 y<=4.\n\nSo cannot be at y=4 at T=36 or before.\n\nMust be at T=40 or later.\n\nThus, min time to y=4 is T=40 with the waiting.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=45.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can reduce by going up faster after.\n\nBut no, I need 5 moves from y=4 to y=9.\n\nAnother thought: since y=5 to 8 are safe at most times, I can go through them quickly.\n\nBut I still need to pass y=4.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=3 at T=38, and then at T=39, instead of going to y=4, I go directly, no.\n\nI think 11 is best.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 at T=44.\n\nAt T=44 y=9.\n\nThen y44=9.\n\ny44 = y43 + Δy43\n\ny43 must be 8,9, or10, but y<=9, so y43=8 or9.\n\nIf y43=8, Δy43=U to y44=9\n\nOr y43=9, Δy43=S or D, but D to 8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y44=9, must have y43=8 and action U.\n\nSimilarly, y43=8, must have y42=7 or8 or9, etc.\n\nSo to have y44=9, need y43=8 and a43=U.\n\ny43=8 at T=43.\n\nHow to reach y=8 at T=43.\n\ny43=8, so y42 must be 7,8,9 with appropriate action.\n\nBut min time to high y.\n\nEarliest to y=8: with 8 up moves from start.\n\nT=34 y=0, after 8 U: y42=8 at T=42.\n\nT=42 y=8.\n\nThen a42=U, y43=9.\n\nBut y43=9 at T=43.\n\nBut in this case, to have y42=8, need actions.\n\nBut at T=38, if I am at high y, but y=4 to8 unsafe at T=38.\n\nFor example, to be at y=8 at T=42, I need to be at y=4 at some point.\n\nSuppose I go straight up: a34=U, y35=1\n\na35=U, y36=2\n\na36=U, y37=3\n\na37=U, y38=4 but unsafe at T=38.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I delay, but to reach y=8 at T=42, I need to be at y=4 at T=38 or earlier, but T=38 earliest and unsafe.\n\nIf I am at y=4 at T=38, unsafe.\n\nIf I am at y=4 later, I cannot reach y=8 at T=42.\n\nFor example, if y=4 at T=40, then y41=5, y42=6, not 8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=42, I must be at y=4 at T=38 or T=39, but both unsafe for y=4.\n\nT=38 y=4 unsafe, T=39 y=4 unsafe.\n\nT=37 y=4 impossible, as y<=3 at T=37.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=8 at T=42 safely, because I must have passed y=4 at T=38 or T=39, both unsafe.\n\nThus, I cannot reach y=8 before T=43 or something.\n\nEarliest safe y=4 at T=40.\n\nThen y40=4\n\ny41=5\n\ny42=6\n\ny43=7\n\ny44=8\n\ny45=9\n\nSo y=9 at T=45.\n\nWith actions from T=34 to T=44.\n\nIn terms of turn, actions at t=34 to t=44 inclusive, 11 actions.\n\nSequence as before.\n\nBut in the sequence, I had y=3 from T=37 to T=39, three turns? Positions: T=37 y=3, T=38 y=3, T=39 y=3, then T=40 y=4.\n\nI stayed at y=3 for three turns? No.\n\nT=37: position y=3\n\nAfter a37=S, T=38 y=3\n\nAfter a38=S, T=39 y=3\n\nThen a39=U, T=40 y=4\n\nSo at T=37,38,39 I am at y=3.\n\nT=37,38,39 all have y=3.\n\nBut y=3 is safe, since unsafe only at 50-53.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut I used two stay actions at T=37 and T=38.\n\na37=S and a38=S.\n\nThen from T=39 to T=44, all U.\n\na39=U to a44=U.\n\nNow, but in the answer, I need to output actions from t_1=34.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: S\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nThen at T=45, y=9.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), so at turn when y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=45, y=9.\n\nWith actions from T=34 to T=44.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I go to y=3 at T=37, then at T=37, instead of staying, I go down to y=2 at T=38.\n\nThen at T=38, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=38, go U to y=3 at T=39.\n\nT=39, y=3, go U to y=4 at T=40.\n\nSame as before, but I used a down and up, so more actions.\n\nFor example, a37=D, y38=2\n\na38=U, y39=3\n\na39=U, y40=4\n\nThen same from y=4 at T=40.\n\nBut now I have extra actions, reach y=9 later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid y=4 during bad times by going faster to higher, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe at T=39, if I can be on y=5 at T=39 without being on y=4 at bad time.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=39, I must be on y=4 at T=38 or T=39.\n\nIf at T=38 on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=39 on y=4, and go U, but at T=39 on y=4 unsafe, so collision.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=5 at T=39 safely.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be on y=5 is T=41 or later.\n\nFor example, y=4 at T=40, y=5 at T=41.\n\nSo I think 11 actions is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 4 at T=40.\n\ny=4 at T=40: safe, as per unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nIn the output, I need to list actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two S at turn 37 and 38.\n\nNow, for freeway 5-8, at T=34, they are unsafe, but I am not on them, so fine.\n\nAlso, at T=38, unsafe, but in the path, at T=38, I am on y=3, not on y=5-8.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 4, there is also unsafe at T=46-48, but by then I am past, y=9 or something.\n\nIn this path, at T=46, I am at y=9 or above, not on freeway, so fine.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can do with 10 actions.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at T=44.\n\nThen y44=9, so y43=8 and a43=U.\n\ny43=8 at T=43.\n\ny43=8, so y42 must be 7,8,9 with action.\n\nEarliest y42=7 with 7 up moves: from T=34, after 7 U, y41=7 at T=41.\n\nThen a41=U, y42=8\n\na42=U, y43=9? y42=8 at T=42, a42=U, y43=9 at T=43.\n\nBut to have y41=7.\n\ny41=7 at T=41.\n\nNeed to pass y=4.\n\nEarliest y=4 at T=40.\n\nThen y40=4, a40=U, y41=5\n\nNot 7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=41, I need y=4 at T=38 or earlier, but T=38 unsafe, earlier impossible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus min H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: S\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nIn the actions, turn 44: U to go to y=9 at T=45.\n\nBut turn 44 action a44=U, then y45=9.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=11, so actions from turn 34 to 34+10=44.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have turn 39: U to y=4 at T=40.\n\nTurn 40: U to y=5 at T=41.\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, but let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5-8, at T=38 unsafe, but I am not on them.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, at T=34, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12), so at T=34, span L= -11 +12(0)= -11, R=0, so covers 0, but since I am at y=0, not on freeway, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be fine.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: S\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\n}\n\nBut in the box, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose at turn 38, I am at y=3, and I go U to y=4 at T=39, but unsafe, cannot.\n\nOr, another freeway.\n\nFor example, at T=38, if I could be on y=1 or 2, but that would require being lower earlier, which delays reaching higher.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 longer, but worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 34\\) is 11, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 34.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any freeway when position \\(x = 0\\) is covered by a car span at that turn. The unsafe turns for each freeway are derived from the car states at turn 34:\n\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3: Unsafe at turns 50, 51, 52, 53 (due to car coverage at position 0).\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at turns 37, 38, 39 (from the second car) and 46, 47, 48 (from the first car).\n- Freeways 5, 6, 7, 8: Unsafe at turns 34 and 38 (from both cars).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 34. The sequence moves up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 37, then stays for two turns (turns 37 and 38) to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) during unsafe turns 37, 38, and 39. At turn 39, it moves to \\(y = 4\\), which is safe at turn 40, then moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 45.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 34: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 35 (safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only at later turns).\n- Turn 35: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 36 (safe, as freeway 2 is unsafe only at later turns).\n- Turn 36: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 37 (safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at later turns).\n- Turn 37: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 38 (safe, and avoids being on \\(y = 4\\) at unsafe turn 38).\n- Turn 38: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 39 (safe, and avoids being on \\(y = 4\\) at unsafe turn 39).\n- Turn 39: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 40 (safe, as freeway 4 is safe at turn 40).\n- Turn 40: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 41 (safe, as freeway 5 is unsafe only at turns 34 and 38).\n- Turn 41: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 42 (safe, as freeway 6 is unsafe only at turns 34 and 38).\n- Turn 42: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 43 (safe, as freeway 7 is unsafe only at turns 34 and 38).\n- Turn 43: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 44 (safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at turns 34 and 38).\n- Turn 44: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45 (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 45 (after 11 actions) and avoids all collisions. No shorter sequence is possible, as being on \\(y = 4\\) before turn 40 results in collision, and moving up directly from \\(y = 4\\) at turn 40 to \\(y = 9\\) requires 5 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: S \\\\\nTurn 38: S \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t=38, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with a given speed. The collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1. That means I only care about cars on the row I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, so if at turn t I'm at y_t, and I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nFor a car, the span is given for turn t_1=38, and for future turns, it moves based on speed and direction.\n\nDirection: right-moving means the car moves to the right, so its span increases: from [τ, h] to [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head is the right end? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd for left-moving, [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nBut for direction, if direction is right, and span is [τ, h], that might be confusing.\n\nLet's look at an example. For freeway 4, there is a car (-32, -43, right, 4). If right, span should be [τ, h] = [-43, -32]? But -43 is less than -32, so [ -43, -32 ] would be from -43 to -32, which is left to right? But direction is right, so moving right.\n\nPosition: smaller x is left, larger x is right, I assume.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, at t_1, span [τ, h] with τ < h, so for example, τ = -43, h = -32, so car from x=-43 to x=-32, and moving right at speed 4 per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span [h, τ] with h > τ, so decreasing.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4, (-32, -43, right, 4): head is -32, tail is -43, but since direction right, span is [tail, head] = [-43, -32].\n\nSimilarly, (4, -7, right, 4): head=4, tail=-7, so span [-7,4] at t_1.\n\n(-7 to 4 is from left to right, so moving right, yes.\n\nAnd (40,29, right,4)? Head=40, tail=29, but 29<40, so [29,40], moving right, speed 4.\n\nBut 29 to 40, head=40, tail=29, that might be inconsistent.\n\nIn the notation, it says for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and for right, head is the right end.\n\nIn (40,29, right,4), head=40, tail=29, so τ=29, h=40, span [29,40].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h left, τ right or something.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars are right-moving? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: all (-36,-47,right,3) so head=-36, tail=-47, so span [-47,-36] at t_1.\n\nFreeway 4: (-32,-43,right,4) → span [-43,-32]\n\n(4,-7,right,4) → span [-7,4]\n\n(40,29,right,4) → head=40, tail=29, but 29<40, so [29,40]? But [τ,h] = [29,40], which is from 29 to 40, moving right.\n\nBut tail should be the back, so for right-moving, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7,8: (0,-11,right,12) → head=0, tail=-11, so span [-11,0] at t_1.\n\nAnd (48,37,right,12) → head=48, tail=37, span [37,48].\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on each freeway at future turns.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for that k, there is a car where 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nSince I start at y=3 at t=38, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from 1 to 8, and I start at 3, so I need to go up to 9, but y=9 is the goal, not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player position: vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nI start at (0,3), which is on freeway y=3? y=3 is a freeway, so I am on freeway 3 at t=38.\n\nSimilarly, when I reach y=9, I'm not on any freeway, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=3 to y=9, so I need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8, but I can stay or move up or down.\n\nSince I need to go to 9, and 9 is above, moving down might not be efficient, but sometimes to avoid cars, I might need to wait or something.\n\nBut since the grid is small, and time is discrete, I need to find a path.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, when 0 is occupied by a car at time T, for T >= 38.\n\nTime T is absolute turn number.\n\nt_1 = 38.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is given by:\n\nFor right-moving car: span(T) = [τ + s*(T-38), h + s*(T-38)]\n\nSince span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] where Δt = T - 38.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all cars here are right-moving, from the state.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: only one, (-36,-47,right,3) so τ=-47, h=-36, s=3\n\nspan(T) = [ -47 + 3*(T-38), -36 + 3*(T-38) ]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -47 + 3(Δt) <= 0 <= -36 + 3(Δt) where Δt = T-38\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span is shifting right.\n\n0 is covered when the car overlaps x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n\n-47 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 3Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so Δt <= 15 since integer? Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T-38, T integer, so Δt integer.\n\n-47 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 15.666, so Δt <= 15\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 + 3Δt => 36 <= 3Δt => Δt >= 12\n\nSo for Δt from 12 to 15 inclusive, 0 is in span.\n\nThus at T = 38 + 12 = 50 to 38+15=53, 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-36,-47,right,3), so same, occupied at T=50 to 53.\n\nFreeway 3: also same, (-36,-47,right,3), occupied T=50 to 53.\n\nBut at t=38, I am on freeway 3, so I need to check if I am safe at t=38.\n\nAt t=38, for freeway 3, car span: [-47 + 3*0, -36 + 3*0] = [-47,-36], 0 is not in [-47,-36] since -36 < 0? -36 is negative, 0 is greater, so -36 < 0, so 0 not in [-47,-36], since -36 < 0, so no collision at t=38 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow freeway 4: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4) so τ=-43, h=-32? Head=-32, tail=-43, so span [τ,h] = [-43,-32]\n\ns=4\n\nspan(T) = [ -43 + 4Δt, -32 + 4Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -43 +4Δt <= 0 <= -32 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -43+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=43 => Δt <= 10.75, so Δt <=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32 +4Δt => 32 <=4Δt => Δt >=8\n\nSo Δt from 8 to 10, T=46 to 48.\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (4,-7,right,4) head=4, tail=-7, span [ -7, 4 ] at t=38? [τ,h] = [-7,4]\n\ns=4\n\nspan(T) = [ -7 +4Δt, 4 +4Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -7+4Δt <=0 <=4+4Δt\n\nFirst: -7+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=7 => Δt <=1.75, so Δt <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=4+4Δt always true since 4+4Δt >=4>0 for Δt>=0\n\nSo only constraint Δt <=1, so for Δt=0 and Δt=1, T=38 and 39.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=38, span [-7,4], 0 is between -7 and 4? -7 <=0<=4, yes.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=39, span [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=2, [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not >=1, so not.\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (40,29,right,4) head=40, tail=29, so [29,40] at t=38\n\nspan(T) = [29+4Δt, 40+4Δt]\n\n0 in span: 29+4Δt <=0 <=40+4Δt? But 29+4Δt >=29>0, so left end >0, so 0 never in span. So always safe from this car.\n\nSo for freeway 4, occupied when:\n\nFrom first car: T=46,47,48\n\nFrom second car: T=38,39\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 occupied at T=38,39,46,47,48\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, s=12, span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t=38\n\nspan(T) = [ -11 +12Δt, 0 +12Δt ] = [ -11+12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -11+12Δt <=0 <=12Δt\n\nFirst: -11+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/12 <1, so Δt <=0 since integer? Δt integer, so only if Δt=0\n\nSecond: 0 <=12Δt always for Δt>=0, but at Δt=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=38, span [-11,0], 0 is included? -11<=0<=0, yes, 0 is the upper bound.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=1, T=39, span [-11+12,0+12]=[1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only at T=38, 0 is occupied by this car.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, span [37,48] at t=38, span(T)=[37+12Δt,48+12Δt], min=37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 5, occupied only at T=38.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars as 5, (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12), so same as above, occupied only at T=38.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied only at T=38.\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied only at T=38.\n\nNow, for freeway 1,2,3, occupied at T=50,51,52,53.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at T=38,39,46,47,48.\n\nAnd freeway 5-8 occupied only at T=38.\n\nBut at T=38, for freeway 5-8, occupied, but I am at y=3 at T=38, not on 5-8, so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=3 at t=38 to y=9.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, with y clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince I need to go to 9, and 3 to 9 is 6 steps up, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal turns should be 6 if I can go up directly, but I need to check if the path is clear.\n\nFirst, let's see where I can be at each time.\n\nStart at t=38, y=3.\n\nAt t=38, on freeway 3, is it occupied? Freeway 3 car: at t=38, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, I can take action at t=38 to go to next position.\n\nLet me denote time starting from t=38.\n\nSet τ = t - 38, so τ=0 at start.\n\nPosition at time τ: y_τ, but in terms of turns.\n\nAt turn t=38 + τ, position y_{38+τ}\n\nBut to simplify, let's use τ as offset.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=38), y=3.\n\nAfter action a_{38}, y_{39} = y_38 + Δy, but y_{39} is position at turn 39.\n\nThe state after action.\n\nTurn T: position y_T, action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nCollision checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nFor turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, I check if freeway y_T has a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end, so at T_end, y_{T_end} =9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, no issue.\n\nNow, from τ=0, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe distance is 6, so min H=6 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might hit cars.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row and each time when it is occupied.\n\nRows y=1 to 8.\n\nTime τ from 0 onwards.\n\nFor row y=1: occupied when? From freeway 1, at τ=12,13,14,15 (T=50,51,52,53)\n\nSimilarly y=2 same as y=1, since same car times.\n\ny=3: occupied at τ=12,13,14,15 (T=50-53)\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied at τ=0,1 (T=38,39) and τ=8,9,10 (T=46,47,48)\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied only at τ=0 (T=38)\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8: occupied only at τ=0 (T=38)\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but I start at y=3, so at τ=0, if I were on y=5, it would be bad, but I'm not.\n\nI need to move from y=3.\n\nAt τ=0, t=38, y=3: safe, as we saw.\n\nI take action a_{38}, which determines y_{39}.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y_{39} = 4\n\nIf S, y_{39} = 3\n\nIf D, y_{39} = 2\n\nThen at turn t=39, position y= y_{39}, and I need to check collision for that position at time T=39.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=9 is above, moving down might delay, so probably not useful, but let's see.\n\nFirst, try to go straight up.\n\nSuppose I go up each turn.\n\nStart τ=0, t=38, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U: then y_{39} =4\n\nAt turn t=39, y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 at t=39: is it occupied? From above, freeway 4 occupied at T=38,39,46,47,48.\n\nT=39 is occupied.\n\ny=4 at t=39, so collision if occupied.\n\nYes, at t=39, freeway 4 has car: from second car, at τ=1, T=39, occupied.\n\nAlso first car not yet, but second car covers T=39.\n\nSo at t=39, if I am on y=4, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=4 at t=39.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at t=39.\n\nAction S at t=38: then y_{39} =3\n\nAt turn t=39, y=3, position.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=39: occupied? Freeway 3 cars, at τ=1, T=39, span: from earlier, for y=3, occupied only at τ=12,13,14,15, so at τ=1, not occupied.\n\nspan at τ=1: [-47+3(1), -36+3(1)] = [-44,-33], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=39, y=3, I can take action.\n\nIf I go down, y_{39}=2, then at t=39, y=2, freeway 2: at τ=1, T=39, not occupied, since occupied only τ=12-15.\n\nSo safe, but moving down away from goal.\n\nProbably not efficient.\n\nBack to up path.\n\nI cannot be on y=4 at t=39.\n\nWhat about at other times?\n\ny=4 is occupied at t=38,39,46,47,48.\n\nt=38: but at t=38, I am at y=3, not y=4.\n\nt=39: occupied.\n\nt=46 to 48 occupied.\n\nBut other times might be free.\n\nFor example, between t=40 to 45, y=4 should be free, except we need to check if any car covers.\n\nFreeway 4 cars:\n\nFirst car: occupied τ=8,9,10 (t=46,47,48)\n\nSecond car: occupied τ=0,1 (t=38,39)\n\nThird car: never\n\nSo at other times, freeway 4 is clear.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\ny=5: occupied only at t=38, so for t>38, free.\n\ny=6,7,8 same, occupied only at t=38, so for t>=39, free.\n\ny=1,2,3 occupied only at t=50-53, which is later.\n\nNow, back to movement.\n\nAt t=38, y=3, safe.\n\nI cannot go directly to y=4 at t=39 because occupied.\n\nSo I must stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for one turn, then go to y=4 at t=40.\n\nAt t=38, action S: then y_{39} =3\n\nAt turn t=39, y=3, safe as above.\n\nThen at t=39, I can take action, say U, then y_{40} =4\n\nAt turn t=40, y=4.\n\nIs freeway 4 occupied at t=40?\n\nt=40, τ=2, T=40.\n\nFor freeway 4, at τ=2, not in occupied times: occupied at τ=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nτ=2 not, so should be free.\n\nCheck: first car span at τ=2: [-43 +4*2, -32 +4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car at τ=2: [-7 +4*2, 4+4*2] = [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], no.\n\nSo yes, free at t=40.\n\nSo at t=40, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=5.\n\nAt t=40, y=4, action U, then y_{41}=5\n\nAt turn t=41, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 at t=41: occupied? Only at t=38, so at t=41, not occupied. Safe.\n\nThen continue: at t=41, action U, y_{42}=6\n\nt=42, y=6, freeway 6: occupied only t=38, so safe.\n\nAction U, y_{43}=7\n\nt=43, y=7, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{44}=8\n\nt=44, y=8, freeway 8: occupied only t=38, so safe.\n\nAction U, y_{45}=9\n\nt=45, y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe, and I reached.\n\nNow, how many turns? Started at t=38, position at t=38.\n\nActions: from t=38 to t=44, actions to reach y=9 at t=45.\n\nt=38: action S (stay), to be at y=3 at t=39? Let's list the sequence.\n\nAt turn t=38: position y=3, I take action a_{38}.\n\nAfter action, y_{39} = y_{38} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t=39, position y_{39}, and so on.\n\nIn this case:\n\nt=38: y=3, take S, so Δy=0, y_{39}=3\n\nt=39: position y=3, take U, so y_{40}=4\n\nt=40: position y=4, take U, y_{41}=5\n\nt=41: y=5, take U, y_{42}=6\n\nt=42: y=6, take U, y_{43}=7\n\nt=43: y=7, take U, y_{44}=8\n\nt=44: y=8, take U, y_{45}=9\n\nNow at t=45, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=38 to t=44, that's 7 actions? t=38,39,40,41,42,43,44: 7 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think, to reach.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=38 to t=38 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t=38 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn the answer, it says: sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after that, at turn t1 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=38 to t=44, H=7 actions? t from 0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn my sequence, actions at t=38 to t=44, that's t1 to t1+6, so t from 0 to 6, H-1=6, so H=7.\n\nThen at t1+H =38+7=45, y=9.\n\nBut I can reach faster? Min is 6 actions if I go directly up without waiting.\n\nBut earlier, I couldn't go directly because at t=39, y=4 would be collision.\n\nIs there a way to go faster?\n\nFor example, if I go up at t=38, but y=4 at t=39 is occupied, so not possible.\n\nGo down? But that would take more time.\n\nAt t=38, go down to y=2, but then I have to go up more, so more turns, worse.\n\nSo the above seems good, H=7.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nt=38: y=3, safe.\n\nAction S: stay, so at t=39, y=3.\n\nt=39: y=3, safe, action U, to y=4 at t=40? Action at t=39: take U, so y_{40} = y_{39} +1 =3+1=4\n\nThen at t=40, position y=4, which is safe as we checked.\n\nThen action U, y_{41}=5\n\nt=41, y=5, safe\n\nU, y_{42}=6\n\nt=42, y=6, safe\n\nU, y_{43}=7\n\nt=43, y=7, safe\n\nU, y_{44}=8\n\nt=44, y=8, safe\n\nU, y_{45}=9\n\nt=45, y=9, done.\n\nActions: t=38: S, t=39: U, t=40: U, t=41: U, t=42: U, t=43: U, t=44: U\n\nSo 7 actions, H=7.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9, min 6 moves, but I had to wait one turn at y=3.\n\nIs there a way to avoid waiting?\n\nFor example, go to y=4 at a different time.\n\nBut at t=39, y=4 is occupied, so I cannot be there.\n\nt=38, if I could be at y=4, but at t=38, I start at y=3, so I cannot be at y=4 at t=38.\n\nOnly at t=39 or later I can be at y=4.\n\nt=39 occupied, t=40 free, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly or something, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at t=38, I go up to y=4, but at t=39, y=4 is occupied, so collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo down to y=2 at t=39, then go up.\n\nBut y=2 at t=39: freeway 2, at t=39, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=3 at t=40, etc.\n\nBut let's see: at t=38, action D: y_{39}=2\n\nt=39, y=2, safe, action U, y_{40}=3\n\nt=40, y=3, action U, y_{41}=4\n\nt=41, y=4, now t=41, τ=3, freeway 4: occupied? τ=3 not in {0,1,8,9,10}, so free.\n\nThen y=4 safe, action U, y_{42}=5, and so on, to y=9 at t=46 or later, which is worse than before.\n\nt=41 y=4, U to y=5 at t=42, U to y=6 at t=43, U to y=7 at t=44, U to y=8 at t=45, U to y=9 at t=46.\n\nSo reached at t=46, with more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo first plan is better.\n\nBut in first plan, I reached at t=45 with H=7.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I don't wait, but go to another row.\n\nAt t=38, instead of stay, go up, but cannot because collision at t=39 on y=4.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at t=40, as I did.\n\nBut y=5 is free after t=38, but I need to get there.\n\nAnother thought: from y=3, at t=38, I go up, but since at t=39 y=4 is occupied, I die.\n\nUnless I move to y=5 directly, but I can only move one step.\n\nPerhaps I can skip y=4 or something, but no.\n\nMaybe at t=38, I go down to y=2, then at t=39, go up to y=3, then at t=40 go to y=4, same as before but worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 later, but I have to go through it.\n\nIn my first sequence, I go to y=4 at t=40, which is fine.\n\nBut let me check if I can go faster by going to higher rows earlier.\n\nFor example, after y=4, I can go up quickly.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 are free after t=38, so I can move fast.\n\nIn my sequence, from t=40 y=4 to t=41 y=5, t=42 y=6, etc., no delay.\n\nThe only delay was at the beginning.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the wait?\n\nWhat if at t=38, I go up to y=4, but since at t=39 I would be on y=4 which is occupied, but the collision is at the turn when I am on the row.\n\nBut I cannot avoid it.\n\nPerhaps I can move to y=4 at a time when it is free, which I did at t=40.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=3 at t=39, then to y=4 at t=40, as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=5 from y=3 in two steps, but no, I have to go through y=4.\n\nUnless I move faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the arrival.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=44, y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=45.\n\nNow, is there any car issue at later times? For example, when I am on y=8 at t=44, it is free, as occupied only at t=38.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 are occupied at t=50-53, but I am not there at that time, I am at y=9 by t=45, which is before.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier with different path.\n\nSuppose at t=38, I go up to y=4, but I get collision at t=39, impossible.\n\nOr, at t=38, stay, then at t=39, instead of going to y=4, I go to y=5? But from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 7.\n\nIn the sequence, actions: t=38: S, t=39: U, t=40: U, t=41: U, t=42: U, t=43: U, t=44: U\n\nt=44 action U to go to y=9 at t=45.\n\nIn terms of the answer, I need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nBut H=7, sequence from t=38 to t=44.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +6: a_{t_1+6} = U\n\nSince H=7, t from 0 to 6.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to 6.\n\nt=0: turn 38, S\n\nt=1: turn 39, U\n\nt=2: turn 40, U\n\nt=3: turn 41, U\n\nt=4: turn 42, U\n\nt=5: turn 43, U\n\nt=6: turn 44, U\n\nThen at turn 45, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t=44, which is t_1 +6.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 38 + 7 -1 = 44, yes.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at t=46,47,48, but I am not there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 at t=50-53, not there.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at t=40, as before.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 before t=45?\n\nFor example, if I start from y=3 at t=38, and go up immediately to y=4 at t=39, but cannot.\n\nAfter t=40, I go up each turn, from y=4 at t=40 to y=5 at t=41, y=6 at t=42, y=7 at t=43, y=8 at t=44, y=9 at t=45.\n\nThat's 5 up moves from y=4, but I needed to get to y=4 at t=40, which required one stay at t=38.\n\nFrom t=38 to t=40, I go from y=3 to y=4 in two turns (stay then up), but if I could go directly, it would be one turn, but I couldn't.\n\nSo min is 7 turns.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly from y=3, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: at t=38, I go down to y=2, then at t=39 go up to y=3, then at t=40 to y=4, same as before but with extra down and up.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars on freeway 5-8 at t=38, but since I am not on them, fine.\n\nAlso, note that for freeway 5, at t=38, there is a car with span [-11,0], so at x=0, which is occupied, but I am on y=3, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe initial turn is t_1=38.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 38: a_{38} = S\n\nTurn 39: a_{39} = U\n\nTurn 40: a_{40} = U\n\nTurn 41: a_{41} = U\n\nTurn 42: a_{42} = U\n\nTurn 43: a_{43} = U\n\nTurn 44: a_{44} = U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 45, position (0,9).\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6?\n\nSuppose I start at t=38, y=3.\n\nIf I could be at y=4 at t=39, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps at t=38, I take action, but I have to take an action.\n\nAnother thought: when I move, the collision is based on the row I am on during that turn.\n\nBut at the turn when I move, I am still on the current row until the action.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at t=38, but I start at y=3, so no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, minimal H is 7.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 38\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy\nThe occupancy of each freeway at position \\(x = 0\\) is determined based on the car spans and their movements. The turns are referenced relative to \\(\\tau = t - 38\\), so \\(\\tau = 0\\) at turn 38.\n\n- **Freeway 1, 2, 3**: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 12, 13, 14, 15\\) (turns 50 to 53).\n- **Freeway 4**: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 0, 1\\) (turns 38, 39) and \\(\\tau = 8, 9, 10\\) (turns 46 to 48).\n- **Freeway 5, 6, 7, 8**: Occupied only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 38).\n\nSince the player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 38, and \\(y = 3\\) is not occupied at \\(\\tau = 0\\), it is safe. However, moving directly to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 39 would result in a collision because freeway 4 is occupied at turn 39. Therefore, the player must wait at \\(y = 3\\) for one turn to avoid this collision.\n\n### Optimal Path\nThe minimal path requires 7 turns (\\(H = 7\\)) with the following action sequence:\n- At turn 38 (\\(t_1\\)), stay at \\(y = 3\\) (action S) to avoid moving to the occupied \\(y = 4\\) at turn 39.\n- At turn 39, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (action U), which is safe since freeway 4 is not occupied at turn 40.\n- From turns 40 to 44, move up each turn (actions U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45. Freeways 5 to 8 are unoccupied after turn 38, so these moves are safe.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 45 without any collisions. The path is optimal because:\n- Moving up directly at turn 38 would cause a collision at turn 39 on \\(y = 4\\).\n- Alternative paths (e.g., moving down) require more turns and are less efficient.\n- The occupancy of freeways 1-3 at later turns (50-53) does not affect the path, as the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 45.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=38}^{44}\\) is:\n\n- Turn 38: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 39: U (move to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 40: U (move to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 41: U (move to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 42: U (move to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 43: U (move to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 44: U (move to \\(y = 9\\))\n\nAfter the last action at turn 44, the position at turn 45 is (0, 9), achieving the goal in \\(H = 7\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 44 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t1=44, with head and tail, direction, and speed. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T I'm on y and move to y+1, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only care about the car on my current y at each turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since there are no cars above y=8, I don't have to worry about cars at y=9. y=9 is safe; I just need to get there.\n\ny=0 is where I start, and it might be safe or not, but I need to move up.\n\nNow, let's list the cars at t1=44.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, head is at -48, tail at -59? That doesn't make sense because usually head is the front, so for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail? Let me read the car update.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] moves to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], so if it's moving left, decreasing x, so head should be the left end? I think I need to interpret the span.\n\nThe notation says:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ should be such that h < τ or h > τ? [h, τ] is an interval, so if it's [h, τ], it could be increasing or decreasing.\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving, both decrease by s per turn, so the whole car moves left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase by s per turn.\n\nNow, for the collision, it says 0 in Span(T) for the car on freeway y_T.\n\nBut for the span, it's given as (head, tail), but head and tail might not be in order.\n\nLook at freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nIf it's right-moving, and head is -48, tail is -59, but -48 > -59, so if head is -48 and tail is -59, that means tail is left of head, so for right-moving, head is on the right, tail on left.\n\nBut the span is given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, if head is right, tail left, then the span should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIt says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\"\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? [τ, h] means from tail to head.\n\nIn the update: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\" → Span(T) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nSo in this case, for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59, right, so since right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time t1=44, span is [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [-59 + 3(T-44), -48 + 3(T-44)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is on freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is within the car's span at T.\n\n0 in [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving, or similar for left.\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except one? Let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, right, speed 3. So span at t1: [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 2: same, (-48, -59, right, 3), so span [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -59, right, 3), span [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFor each, since right-moving, span = [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, so τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: head -12, tail -23, so τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23, -12]\n\nThird car: head 24, tail 13, so τ=13, h=24, span [13,24]? τ=13, h=24, so [13,24]\n\nBut direction is right, so yes.\n\nNow freeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 12), and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, span [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, so τ=-11, h=0, span [-11, 0]\n\nAt t1=44, span [-11, 0]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, (-48,-59,right,12) span [-59,-48], and (0,-11,right,12) span [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have 0 in their span at different turns.\n\nSince the player starts at y=0 at t=44, and needs to go to y=9.\n\ny=0: at turn T, if player is on y=0, but y=0 might not have cars? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1, ..., 8. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut at turn T, if player is on y=0, no collision possible since no cars there. Similarly for y=9.\n\nThe collision is only for y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at t=44, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nNow, I need to move up through y=1 to y=8 without being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I need to choose actions to avoid being on a bad y at a bad time.\n\nBut the cars are moving, so their positions change over time.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns T, 0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for each y, find the times when it is unsafe to be on that y.\n\nThen, for my path, at each turn, depending on my y, it should not be unsafe at that turn.\n\nBut since I can delay or move faster, I can control when I arrive at each y.\n\nLet me define t_rel = T - t1 = T - 44, so time relative to now.\n\nFor each freeway, find for which t_rel, if player is on that freeway at turn 44 + t_rel, collision occurs.\n\nThat is, for some car on that freeway, 0 in span at 44 + t_rel.\n\nSince span depends on t_rel.\n\nLet Δt = t_rel = T - 44.\n\nSo for each freeway:\n\nStart with y=1:\n\nOnly one car: span at Δt: [-59 + 3Δt, -48 + 3Δt] since right-moving, speed 3.\n\n0 in this interval if -59 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 3Δt\n\nSo -59 + 3Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so Δt <= 19 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3Δt => 48 <= 3Δt => Δt >= 16\n\nSo for Δt from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 in span, so unsafe.\n\nΔt=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly for y=2: same car, same thing, unsafe at Δt=16,17,18,19\n\ny=3: same, unsafe Δt=16,17,18,19\n\nNow y=4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) span at Δt: [-59 + 4Δt, -48 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in [-59 + 4Δt, -48 + 4Δt] if -59 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 4Δt\n\nSo -59 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 14.75, so Δt <= 14\n\n0 <= -48 + 4Δt => 48 <= 4Δt => Δt >= 12\n\nSo for first car, unsafe if Δt=12,13,14\n\nBut there are other cars.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) span at Δt: [-23 + 4Δt, -12 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in this if -23 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 4Δt\n\n-23 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 5.75, so Δt <= 5\n\n0 <= -12 + 4Δt => 12 <= 4Δt => Δt >= 3\n\nSo unsafe for Δt=3,4,5\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) head 24, tail 13, so τ=13, h=24, span [13 + 4Δt, 24 + 4Δt] since right-moving.\n\n0 in [13 + 4Δt, 24 + 4Δt]? 13 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 4Δt?\n\n13 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= -13 => Δt <= -3.25, impossible since Δt >=0\n\nAnd 0 <= 24 + 4Δt always true for Δt>=0, but since 13+4Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 is never <= 13+4Δt, so 0 not in [13+4Δt, 24+4Δt] for any Δt>=0.\n\nSo only first and second car matter for y=4.\n\nUnsafe when first car covers 0: Δt=12,13,14\n\nOr second car: Δt=3,4,5\n\nSo unsafe at Δt=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow y=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) span at Δt: [-59 + 12Δt, -48 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in this if -59 + 12Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 12Δt\n\n-59 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt <=4\n\n0 <= -48 + 12Δt => 48 <= 12Δt => Δt >= 4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=4, so only Δt=4\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) head 0, tail -11, span at Δt: [-11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt] = [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 12Δt\n\nFirst: -11 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so Δt <=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12Δt always for Δt>=0\n\nBut Δt <=0 and Δt>=0, so only Δt=0\n\nAt Δt=0, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? -11 <=0<=0? 0<=0 is true, and -11<=0 true, so yes, at Δt=0, 0 is in span.\n\nBut Δt=0 is t=44, current turn.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y, and 0 in span for some car on y at T.\n\nAt t=44, player is at y=0, not on freeway y=5, so no collision.\n\nBut if at some turn player is on y=5 when Δt=0, but Δt=0 is now, and player not on y=5.\n\nFor y=5, unsafe when:\n\nFirst car: at Δt=4, unsafe\n\nSecond car: at Δt=0, unsafe, but since player not on y=5 at t=44, it's only unsafe if player is on y=5 at Δt=0, which is not the case.\n\nSo for future, second car at Δt=0 is now, but for later Δt, when is 0 in span.\n\nSpan is [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 12Δt\n\nAs above, only when Δt=0, because for Δt=1, span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in; Δt=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor Δt>0, min of span is -11+12Δt, which for Δt>=1, >=1, so 0 not <= min, so not in.\n\nSimilarly for Δt<0, but not relevant.\n\nSo only unsafe at Δt=0 for second car, but since player not on y=5 at t=44, it's safe at other times except for first car at Δt=4.\n\nFirst car at Δt=4: span [-59 + 12*4, -48 + 12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so 0 in, yes.\n\nSo y=5 unsafe only at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6: same as y=5, cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSo similarly, unsafe at Δt=4 for first car, and at Δt=0 for second, but Δt=0 irrelevant, so unsafe only at Δt=4.\n\ny=7: same, unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=8: same, unsafe at Δt=4\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe at Δt=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same, Δt=16,17,18,19\n\ny=3: same, Δt=16,17,18,19\n\ny=4: unsafe at Δt=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=6: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=7: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=8: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at Δt=0 (t=44).\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince I can only change y by +1, -1, or 0 per turn, and I start at y=0, want to go to y=9, the minimal number of turns is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's see if going straight up is possible.\n\nStart at t=44, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action: U, D, S.\n\nAfter action, y changes.\n\nAt turn T=44 + Δt, player position y_{44 + Δt}\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should reach as soon as possible.\n\nSo let's simulate going up every turn.\n\nAt turn t=44 (Δt=0), y=0, safe. Action U, then at t=45 (Δt=1), y=1.\n\nNow, at Δt=1, y=1: is it unsafe?\n\nFor y=1, unsafe at Δt=16-19, not 1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, action U, t=46 (Δt=2), y=2, safe.\n\nt=47 (Δt=3), y=3, now Δt=3, y=3 unsafe? y=3 unsafe at Δt=16-19, not 3, so safe.\n\nBut y=3 is freeway 3, unsafe only at 16-19, yes.\n\nt=48 (Δt=4), y=4? After U from y=3 to y=4.\n\nAt t=47, Δt=3, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U, so at t=48, Δt=4, y=4.\n\nNow y=4 at Δt=4: unsafe times are Δt=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nΔt=4 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nCollision!\n\nSo at t=48, Δt=4, y=4, unsafe.\n\nCannot go straight up.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=4 at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=4, y=5,6,7,8 are also unsafe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at Δt=4, similarly 6,7,8.\n\nBut I might not be on them at that time.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible but skip the unsafe times.\n\nSince I can stay or go down, I might wait or move down to avoid.\n\nBut going down might cost extra turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all unsafe times per y.\n\ny=1: unsafe Δt=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same 16-19\n\ny=3: same 16-19\n\ny=4: unsafe Δt=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe Δt=4\n\ny=6: unsafe Δt=4\n\ny=7: unsafe Δt=4\n\ny=8: unsafe Δt=4\n\nNow, I need to be at y=0 at Δt=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some Δt=H-1, since turns from t=44 to t=44+H-1, so time from Δt=0 to Δt=H-1.\n\nAt Δt=H-1, y=9.\n\nThe path: at each Δt, I have a y, and it must be safe at that Δt.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min steps.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo the minimal steps is 9, if no obstacles.\n\nBut with obstacles, I might need more.\n\nFirst, the critical points are around Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe except y=1,2,3 might be safe, but y=1,2,3 unsafe only at later times.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=1,2,3 are safe, since unsafe only at 16-19.\n\ny=4 unsafe at 3,4,5,12,13,14 so at 4 unsafe.\n\ny=5-8 unsafe at 4.\n\nSo at Δt=4, only y=0,1,2,3,9 safe, but y=9 not reached yet.\n\ny=0,1,2,3 safe at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nNow, I need to pass through y=4 to y=8.\n\nBut y=4 has multiple unsafe times: 3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\ny=5-8 only unsafe at Δt=4.\n\nSo for y=5-8, I can be there except at exactly Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=4, avoid Δt=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0, Δt=0.\n\nI want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 quickly.\n\nFrom Δt=0: y=0, safe. Action U, to y=1 at Δt=1.\n\nΔt=1: y=1, safe. Action U, to y=2 at Δt=2.\n\nΔt=2: y=2, safe. Action U, to y=3 at Δt=3.\n\nNow Δt=3: y=3, is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at 16-19, not 3, so safe.\n\nBut at Δt=3, if I go up, I go to y=4 at Δt=4.\n\nBut Δt=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot go up at Δt=3.\n\nI could stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=4 at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=3, y=4 is unsafe, so if I were on y=4 at Δt=3, it would be bad, but I'm not, I'm on y=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I stay, then at Δt=4, I am still at y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nIf I go down to y=2, but that might be worse.\n\nSo let's say at Δt=3, y=3, I stay: action S, so y stays 3, at Δt=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at Δt=4, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nNow I can go up to y=4 at Δt=5.\n\nBut at Δt=5, y=4 is unsafe, because y=4 unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nUnsafe at 3,4,5, so Δt=5 unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo if I go up at Δt=4 to y=4 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nAt Δt=4, I am at y=3, if I go up, to y=4 at Δt=5, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at Δt=4, y=3, then at Δt=5, I am still y=3.\n\nThen I can go up at Δt=5 to y=4 at Δt=6.\n\nNow Δt=6, y=4: is it safe? y=4 unsafe at 3,4,5,12,13,14. Δt=6 not in, so should be safe.\n\nΔt=6,7,8,9,10,11 should be safe for y=4, since unsafe only at 3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\n12,13,14 are later.\n\nSo at Δt=6, y=4 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I need to go to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at Δt=4, which is past, but Δt=4 is over.\n\nNow, at Δt=6, if I am at y=4, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at Δt=7.\n\nNow y=5 at Δt=7: unsafe? y=5 only unsafe at Δt=4, not 7, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 only unsafe at Δt=4, so at Δt=7 safe.\n\nI can go up to y=6 at Δt=8, y=7 at Δt=9, y=8 at Δt=10, y=9 at Δt=11.\n\nBut at Δt=10, y=8, is it safe? y=8 unsafe only at Δt=4, so at Δt=10 safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut I have to worry about later unsafe times for y=1,2,3,4 but since I am moving up, I might be past them.\n\nIn this path: let's list the turns.\n\nStart: Δt=0, t=44, y=0, action U → Δt=1, t=45, y=1\n\nAction U → Δt=2, t=46, y=2\n\nAction U → Δt=3, t=47, y=3\n\nNow at Δt=3, instead of U, I stay: action S → Δt=4, t=48, y=3 (still)\n\nThen action U → Δt=5, t=49, y=4? No.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=3, action U: then at Δt=5, y=4.\n\nBut Δt=5, y=4 unsafe! Problem.\n\nI forgot.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=3, if I go U, to y=4 at Δt=5, but Δt=5 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=4 at Δt=5.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=3, I can stay again: action S, so at Δt=5, y=3 still.\n\nThen at Δt=5, y=3, action U → Δt=6, t=50, y=4\n\nNow Δt=6, y=4: as above, safe, since not 3,4,5,12,13,14? 12-14 later, Δt=6<12, so safe.\n\nThen action U → Δt=7, t=51, y=5\n\ny=5 at Δt=7: unsafe only at 4, not 7, safe.\n\nAction U → Δt=8, t=52, y=6\n\nSafe.\n\nAction U → Δt=9, t=53, y=7\n\nSafe.\n\nAction U → Δt=10, t=54, y=8\n\nSafe.\n\nAction U → Δt=11, t=55, y=9\n\nReached at Δt=11.\n\nH = number of turns from t=44 to t=55, that's 12 turns? Let's see.\n\nt=44 to t=55 inclusive? Turns: t=44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55.\n\nThat's 12 turns, but Δt from 0 to 11, so H=12, since from t=44 to t=44+H-1=55, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut I started at t=44, ended at t=55, after 11 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, I perform action a_t, then move to next state.\n\nAt turn t=44, I am at y=0. I perform action a_{44}, then at turn t=45, I am at y_{45} = y_{44} + Δy.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe minimal T with y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions from t=44 to t=T-1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position for next turn.\n\nThe position at turn t is given, then I choose action for turn t.\n\nThe player position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI start at t=44, y=0.\n\nI perform actions a_{44}, a_{45}, ..., up to some a_{44 + H - 1}, such that after that, at turn 44 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and at turn 44 + H, y=9.\n\nSince I start at t=44, after H actions, I am at t=44 + H.\n\nSet t_start = 44.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=44, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=45, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at t=44 + H, y=9.\n\nSo I need to find minimal H and actions a_{44} to a_{44+H-1} such that y_{44+H} = 9, and for all t from 44 to 44+H-1, when I am at y_t, it is safe, meaning no collision at that turn t.\n\nCollision at turn t only if y_t between 1 and 8 and 0 in car span on y_t at turn t.\n\nIn terms of Δt = t - 44.\n\nAt turn t, Δt = t - 44.\n\ny_t must be safe at Δt.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nIn my earlier attempt: I went up to y=3 quickly, but had to stay to avoid y=4 at bad times.\n\nFrom Δt=0, t=44, y=0, safe. Action U → Δt=1, t=45, y=1, safe.\n\nAction U → Δt=2, t=46, y=2, safe.\n\nAction U → Δt=3, t=47, y=3, safe.\n\nNow at t=47, Δt=3, y=3. Instead of going up, I stay: action S → so at t=48, Δt=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=48, Δt=4, y=3, I stay again: action S → at t=49, Δt=5, y=3.\n\nNow at t=49, Δt=5, y=3, safe. Action U → at t=50, Δt=6, y=4.\n\ny=4 at Δt=6: safe, as before.\n\nThen action U → t=51, Δt=7, y=5, safe.\n\nAction U → t=52, Δt=8, y=6, safe.\n\nAction U → t=53, Δt=9, y=7, safe.\n\nAction U → t=54, Δt=10, y=8, safe.\n\nAction U → t=55, Δt=11, y=9, reached.\n\nSo at t=55, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{44} to a_{54}, that's 11 actions? t=44 to t=54 inclusive? Actions at t=44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54.\n\nThat's 11 actions, and at t=55, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns? The question says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is reached.\n\nIn this case, t1=44, H=11, actions from t=44 to t=54, and at t=55, y=9.\n\nBut t=55 is turn t1 + H =44+11=55.\n\nYes.\n\nH=11 turns? Turns: the actions are taken over H turns, meaning H actions.\n\nThe minimal possible is 9, but here 11 due to waiting.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nPerhaps I can go up slower or faster to avoid.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, I could stay at y=0 for some time, but that might not help.\n\nGo to y=1 later.\n\nBut I need to pass y=4.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at Δt=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nI need to be on y=4 at some Δt not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, need to not be at Δt=4, etc.\n\nIn my path, I was on y=4 at Δt=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, could I be on y=4 earlier? Δt=0,1,2 are safe for y=4? Δt=0: t=44, y=4? But I start at y=0, it takes time to reach y=4.\n\nAt Δt=0, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I go up every turn, at Δt=4, y=4, but unsafe.\n\nAt Δt=2, if I were at y=4, but from y=0, at Δt=1, y=1; Δt=2, y=2; cannot be y=4 at Δt=2.\n\nEarliest to be at y=4 is Δt=4, but unsafe.\n\nNext possible is Δt=6, as I did, or later.\n\nBut Δt=6,7,8,9,10,11 are safe until Δt=12.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nIn my path, I reached at Δt=11.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 at Δt=2, but impossible.\n\nΔt=1: y=1; Δt=2: y=2; Δt=3: y=3; Δt=4: y=4 unsafe; so I have to wait until at least Δt=6 to be on y=4.\n\nThen from there, up to y=9 in 5 more turns: to y=5 at Δt=7, y=6 at Δt=8, ..., y=9 at Δt=11.\n\nSo minimal to reach y=4 safely is Δt=6, then y=9 at Δt=11.\n\nCould I go faster after?\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, 5 actions, so at least Δt=11 if start from y=4 at Δt=6.\n\nBut I could reach y=4 at Δt=6, but is there a way to be at y=4 earlier? No, because Δt=4 and 5 unsafe, and before that I can't reach.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=0; Δt=1, y=1; Δt=2, y=2; Δt=3, y=3; then I have to stay or something, but if I go to y=4 at Δt=4 or 5, unsafe, so must wait until Δt=6 to go to y=4.\n\nPerhaps I can go to a higher y earlier by going slower or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go down to avoid, but that seems worse.\n\nFor example, at Δt=3, y=3, instead of staying, I go down to y=2 at Δt=4.\n\nThen at Δt=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go up, but I need to go to y=4 later.\n\nFor example, at Δt=4, y=2, action U to y=3 at Δt=5.\n\nΔt=5, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U to y=4 at Δt=6, same as before.\n\nThen same path, but I wasted a down and up, so worse.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 longer, same thing.\n\nSo the path I have seems efficient: reach y=3 at Δt=3, stay for two turns until Δt=5 at y=3, then go to y=4 at Δt=6, then up to y=9 at Δt=11.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nAt t=44 (Δt=0), y=0: action U → t=45, y=1\n\nt=45 (Δt=1), y=1: action U → t=46, y=2\n\nt=46 (Δt=2), y=2: action U → t=47, y=3\n\nt=47 (Δt=3), y=3: action S (stay) → t=48, y=3\n\nt=48 (Δt=4), y=3: action S (stay) → t=49, y=3\n\nt=49 (Δt=5), y=3: action U → t=50, y=4\n\nt=50 (Δt=6), y=4: action U → t=51, y=5\n\nt=51 (Δt=7), y=5: action U → t=52, y=6\n\nt=52 (Δt=8), y=6: action U → t=53, y=7\n\nt=53 (Δt=9), y=7: action U → t=54, y=8\n\nt=54 (Δt=10), y=8: action U → t=55, y=9\n\nReached at t=55.\n\nActions: U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nFrom t=44 to t=54: actions U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nBut I have to consider the later unsafe times for y=4 at Δt=12,13,14.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=4 at Δt=6, which is before 12, so no issue.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at Δt=11, before y=1,2,3 become unsafe at 16-19.\n\nBut I am not on them anymore.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at Δt=6, but then to y=9 at Δt=11.\n\nMinimal is 9 turns, but I used 11.\n\nIs there a way to be on y=4 at Δt=6, but start later or something.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at lower y to avoid, but I need to go up.\n\nAnother point: at Δt=4, y=5-8 are unsafe, but since I am at y=3, not affected.\n\nBut if I could be at y=5 or something earlier, but I can't because y=4 blocks.\n\nFor example, if I could jump, but I can't.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at Δt=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSo at Δt=6 to 11, safe.\n\nI am on y=4 at Δt=6, then move up.\n\nCould I be on y=4 at Δt=11? But that would be later, and then I need to go to y=9, so at Δt=16, which might be unsafe for lower y, but I can be higher.\n\nBut later would be worse, since I reach later.\n\nFor example, if I delay, I might hit the unsafe at 12-14.\n\nBut in this case, I avoid it by going early.\n\nNow, but at Δt=12,13,14, y=4 unsafe, but I am already past y=4 by then.\n\nIn my path, at Δt=12, I am at y=7 or something.\n\nΔt=12: t=44+12=56, in my path at t=56? t=44+H, H=11, t=55 at y=9, so t=56 not reached.\n\nIn path: at Δt=11, t=55, y=9, done.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce the waiting.\n\nFor example, at Δt=3, y=3, I could go down to y=2 at Δt=4, but then I need to come back, which costs more.\n\nFor instance: at Δt=3, y=3, action D → t=48, Δt=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=48, action U → t=49, Δt=5, y=3\n\nThen at t=49, action U → t=50, Δt=6, y=4\n\nSame as before, but I did D and U instead of S and S, so I have an extra action, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nStart: t=44, y=0, action S → t=45, y=0? Action S, y stays same.\n\nAt t=44, y=0, action S → t=45, y=0\n\nThen action U → t=46, y=1\n\nAction U → t=47, y=2\n\nAction U → t=48, y=3\n\nNow at t=48, Δt=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=4.\n\nIf I go U at t=48, to y=4 at t=49, Δt=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo I have to stay or something.\n\nAction S at t=48 → t=49, y=3\n\nThen U at t=49 → t=50, y=4 at Δt=6, same as before.\n\nBut I wasted a stay at start, so now I reach later.\n\nFor example: actions: S (t=44), U (t=45), U (t=46), U (t=47), S (t=48), U (t=49), then to y=4 at t=50, same as before but started later.\n\nt=44: S → y=0 at t=45\n\nt=45: U → y=1 at t=46\n\nt=46: U → y=2 at t=47\n\nt=47: U → y=3 at t=48\n\nt=48: S → y=3 at t=49\n\nt=49: U → y=4 at t=50\n\nThen same as before, but now at t=50, y=4, Δt=6, then up to y=9 at t=55, but t=55 is Δt=11, same time, but I used one extra action? Let's see the turn.\n\nAt t=49, y=4? t=49: after action U at t=48, to y=4 at t=49? No.\n\nt=48: at y=3, action U → at t=49, y=4\n\nBut Δt= t-44, t=49, Δt=5, y=4, which is unsafe! Δt=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=48, Δt=4, y=3.\n\nIf I do U at t=48, to y=4 at t=49, Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I do S at t=48, to y=3 at t=49, Δt=5.\n\nThen at t=49, y=3, action U to y=4 at t=50, Δt=6.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut compared to first path, I have an extra S at the beginning or something.\n\nIn first path: actions at t=44:U, t=45:U, t=46:U, t=47:S, t=48:S, t=49:U (to y=4 at t=50), etc.\n\nIn this alternative: if I start with S, then at t=44:S, to y=0 at t=45; then t=45:U to y=1 at t=46; t=46:U to y=2 at t=47; t=47:U to y=3 at t=48; t=48:S to y=3 at t=49; t=49:U to y=4 at t=50; same as before.\n\nBut now I have an action at t=44 which is S, and I reach y=9 at same t=55, but with one extra action, so H=12 instead of 11.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo first path better.\n\nCan I reduce the waiting at y=3?\n\nIn first path, I stayed at y=3 for two turns: at t=47 and t=48, both S, so y=3 from Δt=3 to Δt=5.\n\nThen to y=4 at Δt=6.\n\nBut at Δt=5, I am still at y=3, then go to y=4 at Δt=6.\n\nCould I go to y=4 at Δt=6 with less waiting?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=3 earlier, but I am at y=3 at Δt=3, which is earliest.\n\nThen I have to avoid y=4 at Δt=4 and 5, so I need to be not on y=4 during those times.\n\nSince I can only move one step, if I am at y=3 at Δt=3, I can stay at y=3 for Δt=4 and Δt=5, then go to y=4 at Δt=6.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at some point, it takes extra to come back.\n\nSo I think two stays are necessary to skip Δt=4 and 5 for y=4.\n\nΔt=4 and 5 are unsafe, so I need to be on y=4 at Δt <=2 or >=6.\n\nBut <=2 impossible from start, so >=6.\n\nSo minimal to be on y=4 is Δt=6.\n\nThen from there to y=9 in 5 steps, so arrive at y=9 at Δt=11.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, meaning the actions from t=44 to t=44+H-1, and y at t=44+H.\n\nSo with H=11, t=44 to 54 actions, y=9 at t=55.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that at no point I am on a freeway when unsafe.\n\nIn the path: let's list for each turn t, Δt, y, and if safe.\n\nt=44, Δt=0, y=0, safe (no car)\n\nAction U\n\nt=45, Δt=1, y=1, safe (unsafe only 16-19)\n\nAction U\n\nt=46, Δt=2, y=2, safe\n\nAction U\n\nt=47, Δt=3, y=3, safe (unsafe only 16-19)\n\nAction S\n\nt=48, Δt=4, y=3, safe\n\nAction S\n\nt=49, Δt=5, y=3, safe\n\nAction U\n\nt=50, Δt=6, y=4, now y=4 at Δt=6: unsafe times 3,4,5,12,13,14; 6 not in, so safe.\n\nAction U\n\nt=51, Δt=7, y=5, y=5 unsafe only at Δt=4, not 7, safe.\n\nAction U\n\nt=52, Δt=8, y=6, safe (only unsafe at 4)\n\nAction U\n\nt=53, Δt=9, y=7, safe\n\nAction U\n\nt=54, Δt=10, y=8, safe (only unsafe at 4)\n\nAction U\n\nt=55, Δt=11, y=9, safe, reached.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a path with H=10? That would mean reaching at t=54, y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=54, that means at t=54, after action, y=9.\n\nSo I must be at y=8 at t=53, then action U to y=9 at t=54.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=53, I need to be at y=7 at t=52, and so on.\n\nMinimal time: to be at y=4 at some t.\n\nEarliest safe for y=4 is t=50, Δt=6.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=50, to y=5 at t=51, y=6 at t=52, y=7 at t=53, y=8 at t=54, y=9 at t=55.\n\nThat's t=55.\n\nIf I could be at y=4 earlier, but cannot, since t=48 or 49 unsafe.\n\nt=48: Δt=4, y=4 unsafe; t=49: Δt=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nt=47: Δt=3, y=4 unsafe, and I cannot be at y=4 at t=47 anyway, since at t=47 I am at y=3 if I go up.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 before t=50 safely.\n\nThus cannot reach y=9 before t=55.\n\nHence H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two S actions, which are necessary.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nt1=44.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: S\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nAnd at turn 55, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn 44 to 54, H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t1 to t1+H-1=44 to 54.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (24,13,right,4), but I thought it was not covering 0, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 5, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12), at Δt=0, span [-11,0], covers 0, but at t=44, I am at y=0, not on freeway 5, so no issue.\n\nAnd it doesn't cover 0 later.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nThe minimal H is 11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: S\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nIn the action, for turn 54, I have U to go to y=9 at t=55.\n\nBut in the sequence, it says up to turn t1 + H -1 =44+11-1=54.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the format.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo for t1=44.\n\nThus:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: S\nTurn 48: S\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\n}\n\nBut this is for H=11, actions from 44 to 54.\n\nAnd at turn 55, position (0,9).\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 55, which is after the last action.\n\nIn the task, it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"? No.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" at which turn?\n\nIn the dynamics, after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor t1 + H -1, the action is performed, leading to position at t1 + H.\n\nIn the answer, it says \"Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\"\n\nIn my case, t1=44, H=11, so actions from turn 44 to 54.\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U, then at turn 55, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write the turns clearly.\n\nSince t1=44, I can write the absolute turns.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 11 actions, from t=44 to t=54.\n\nNow, but in the car for freeway 4, at Δt=12,13,14 unsafe, but I am not there, so ok.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am not on the new freeway until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, when I go from y=3 to y=4 at t=49 action U, to y=4 at t=50.\n\nAt t=49, I am at y=3, performing action U.\n\nThen at t=50, I am at y=4.\n\nAnd at t=50, Δt=6, y=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly, all covered.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 44\\) is 11. This is achieved by executing the following sequence of actions, which avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 3\\) during the unsafe periods for \\(y = 4\\) (specifically at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 5\\), where \\(\\Delta t = t - 44\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 44, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 45.\n- At turn 45, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 46.\n- At turn 46, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 47.\n- At turn 47, action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 48 to avoid moving to \\(y = 4\\) at an unsafe time (\\(\\Delta t = 4\\) or \\(\\Delta t = 5\\)).\n- At turn 48, action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 49, continuing to avoid unsafe times.\n- At turn 49, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 50 (\\(\\Delta t = 6\\), which is safe for \\(y = 4\\)).\n- At turn 50, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 51 (\\(\\Delta t = 7\\), safe for \\(y = 5\\)).\n- At turn 51, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 52 (\\(\\Delta t = 8\\), safe for \\(y = 6\\)).\n- At turn 52, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 53 (\\(\\Delta t = 9\\), safe for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- At turn 53, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 54 (\\(\\Delta t = 10\\), safe for \\(y = 8\\)).\n- At turn 54, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 55, reaching the goal.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\)**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\) (i.e., turns 60 to 63). The player is not on these freeways at these times.\n- **Freeway \\(y = 4\\)**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\) (turns 47, 48, 49, 56, 57, 58). The player is at \\(y = 4\\) only at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\) (turn 50), which is safe.\n- **Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\)**: Unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (turn 48). The player is not on these freeways at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 55 (\\(\\Delta t = 11\\)), before any later unsafe times and with no cars on \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H\\) because:\n- The earliest safe time to be at \\(y = 4\\) is \\(\\Delta t = 6\\) (turn 50), as \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) are unsafe, and reaching \\(y = 4\\) earlier is impossible from the start.\n- From \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\), moving up one freeway per turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 5 additional turns, resulting in \\(H = 11\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 44: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) on turn t1 = 48. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car's span includes 0 at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3: each has one car: (-36, -47, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. Head h and tail τ: for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] since it moves right, so head is larger. In the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, head and tail might be such that h > τ or something? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3). Direction is right, so according to the rule, for right-moving, initial span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? But in the input it's written as (head, tail), but in the rule, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the description: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so head > tail, and span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span is [head, tail] with head > tail? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be left of tail, so h < τ, and span [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nBut in the input, for all cars, head and tail are given, and for right-moving, like (-36, -47), -36 > -47, so head = -36, tail = -47, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36], which makes sense.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, etc.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nAnd when moving, if I move at turn T to y_{T+1}, I am not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and I only check collision for row y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 6, since I need to move up 6 steps, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so it could be more.\n\nBut let's see the car positions and how they move.\n\nFirst, let's define the time from current turn. Set τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn t1.\n\nPlayer position at τ: y_τ\n\nStart: y_0 = 3\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, y_{t} for t=0 to H, with y_H = 9.\n\nActions are taken at turns, so after H actions, we have H+1 positions, from t=0 to t=H.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1 + H - 1, so H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn t1 + H is (0,9).\n\nAt turn t1, position is (0,3), after action a_{t1}, we move to new position at turn t1+1, and so on, up to after action a_{t1 + H - 1}, position at turn t1 + H is (0,9).\n\nSo the position at time turn T is y_T.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T, when we are at position (0, y_T), if y_T between 1 and 8, we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at that turn T.\n\nNow, cars: let's list for each freeway and each car, the span as a function of τ = T - t1.\n\nt1 = 48.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial head, tail, dir, speed at t1.\n\nAt time T = t1 + τ, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s τ, τ - s τ]? Span(T) = [h - s (T - t1), τ - s (T - t1)] but τ is tail, so [h - s τ, tail - s τ] where τ here is time offset, confusing.\n\nUse Δt for time since t1.\n\nSet Δt = T - t1.\n\nAt Δt, span:\n\nFor left-moving car: [h - s Δt, tail - s Δt]\n\nFor right-moving car: [tail + s Δt, head + s Δt]\n\nIn the input, head and tail are given.\n\nNow, collision if for freeway y at time Δt, 0 in [low, high] for some car on that row.\n\nBut freeway y is fixed, and cars are on specific rows.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head = -36, tail = -47, dir = right, speed = 3\n\nSo right-moving, span at Δt: [tail + s Δt, head + s Δt] = [-47 + 3 Δt, -36 + 3 Δt]\n\n0 in this span if -47 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 3 Δt\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-36, -47, right, 3) same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 all have identical cars: each has one car with same parameters.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars: \n\nFirst car: (-32, -43, right, 4) so right-moving, span at Δt: [-43 + 4 Δt, -32 + 4 Δt]\n\nSecond car: (4, -7, right, 4)? Head=4, tail=-7, dir=right, speed=4, span at Δt: [-7 + 4 Δt, 4 + 4 Δt]\n\nThird car: (40, 29, right, 4)? Head=40, tail=29? 40 > 29, dir=right, so span: [29 + 4 Δt, 40 + 4 Δt]\n\nBut freeway y=4, and we care about when 0 is in span for this row.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12, span at Δt: [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12, span: [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 all have identical car configurations.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above freeway 8, so no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut we start at y=3, need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal path up, but avoid cars when on rows 1-8.\n\nNow, let's find for each row, when it is occupied, meaning when 0 is in some car's span on that row at time Δt.\n\nFirst, for freeway y=1:\n\nOne car: span at Δt: [-47 + 3 Δt, -36 + 3 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -36 + 3 Δt? No:\n\n0 in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSo low = -47 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 and high = -36 + 3 Δt ≥ 0.\n\nSo -47 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3 Δt ≤ 47 ⇒ Δt ≤ 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so Δt ≤ 15 since integer? Δt is integer, turns.\n\nSimilarly, -36 + 3 Δt ≥ 0 ⇒ 3 Δt ≥ 36 ⇒ Δt ≥ 12.\n\nSo for Δt from 12 to 15 inclusive, 0 in span for y=1.\n\nlow ≤ 0 ≤ high\n\n-47 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3Δt ≤ 47 ⇒ Δt ≤ 15.666, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 15\n\n-36 + 3Δt >= 0 ⇒ 3Δt >= 36 ⇒ Δt >= 12\n\nSo Δt = 12,13,14,15\n\nSimilarly for y=2, same car, so same occupied times: Δt=12,13,14,15\n\nFor y=3, same: Δt=12,13,14,15\n\nNow freeway y=4:\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32, -43, right, 4), span: [-43 + 4 Δt, -32 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -43 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 4Δt\n\n-43 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4Δt ≤ 43 ⇒ Δt ≤ 10.75, so Δt <= 10\n\n-32 + 4Δt ≥ 0 ⇒ 4Δt ≥ 32 ⇒ Δt ≥ 8\n\nSo for first car, occupied if 8 <= Δt <= 10\n\nBut we need to check all cars, and 0 in any span.\n\nSecond car: (4, -7, right, 4), span: [-7 + 4 Δt, 4 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -7 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 4 + 4Δt\n\nNow, -7 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4Δt ≤ 7 ⇒ Δt ≤ 1.75, so Δt <= 1\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 4 + 4Δt always true since 4+4Δt >=4>0 for Δt>=0\n\nBut low <=0 <= high\n\n-7 +4Δt <=0 ⇒ Δt <= 1.75, so Δt <=1\n\nAnd high = 4+4Δt >=0 always, so if Δt <=1, low <=0, and high>=0, so 0 in span for Δt <=1\n\nSpecifically, for Δt=0: low = -7, high=4, -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nΔt=1: low=-7+4=-3, high=4+4=8, -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nΔt=2: low=-7+8=1, high=4+8=12, 1<=0<=12? 1 <=0 false, 0<1, not <=, so 0 not >= low, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt=0 and 1, 0 in span.\n\nThird car: (40, 29, right, 4), span: [29 + 4 Δt, 40 + 4 Δt]\n\nlow = 29+4Δt >=29>0, so low >0, so 0 < low, not <= high? 0 <= high is true, but 0 < low, so 0 not in [low, high] since low>0.\n\nSo for y=4, occupied if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: Δt=8,9,10\n\nSecond car: Δt=0,1\n\nThird car: never, since low>0\n\nSo overall, y=4 occupied at Δt=0,1, and 8,9,10\n\nNow freeway y=5:\n\nCars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12, span at Δt: [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: low <=0 <= high\n\n-11 +12Δt <=0 and 0 <= 12Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= 12Δt always true for Δt >=0\n\n-11 +12Δt <=0 ⇒ 12Δt <=11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/12 <1, so Δt <=0? Δt integer, so for Δt=0: low=-11, high=0, -11<=0<=0, yes 0<=0.\n\nFor Δt=1: low=-11+12=1, high=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, false, not <= low.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, 0 in span for first car.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), span: [37 +12 Δt, 48 +12 Δt]\n\nlow = 37+12Δt >=37>0, so always low>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for y=5, occupied only at Δt=0 by first car.\n\nBut at Δt=0, which is turn t1, player is at y=3, not y=5, so for y=5, at Δt=0, occupied, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 6,7,8 same as y=5.\n\ny=6: same cars, so occupied only at Δt=0\n\nSimilarly y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the times when it is occupied (0 in some car span):\n\n- y=1: occupied at Δt = 12,13,14,15\n\n- y=2: occupied at Δt = 12,13,14,15\n\n- y=3: occupied at Δt = 12,13,14,15\n\n- y=4: occupied at Δt = 0,1, and 8,9,10\n\n- y=5: occupied at Δt = 0\n\n- y=6: occupied at Δt = 0\n\n- y=7: occupied at Δt = 0\n\n- y=8: occupied at Δt = 0\n\nAt Δt=0, y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but player starts at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nPlayer position at time Δt is y_{t1 + Δt}, but Δt is offset, at Δt=0, turn t1, position (0,3)\n\nWe need to plan actions to change y.\n\nThe player must not be on a row when it is occupied at that time.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, y=3 is not occupied yet, since occupied from Δt=12, so at Δt=0, y=3 is safe.\n\ny=4 is occupied at Δt=0 and Δt=1, so if we are on y=4 at Δt=0 or Δt=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 occupied only at Δt=0, so if we are on those rows at Δt=0, collision, but at Δt=0 we are at y=3.\n\nNow, we start at Δt=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some Δt = H.\n\nMinimal H, since we start at y=3, need to increase by 6, so min H=6 if we go straight up with no delays.\n\nBut we have to avoid occupied times.\n\nLet me list the occupied periods for each row:\n\ny=3: occupied Δt=12-15, so safe for Δt <12 or >15\n\ny=4: occupied Δt=0,1 and 8,9,10, so safe for Δt=2,3,4,5,6,7 and Δt>=11\n\ny=5: occupied only Δt=0, so safe for all Δt except 0, but since occupied only at Δt=0, safe for Δt>=1\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8: occupied only at Δt=0, so safe for Δt >=1\n\ny=1 and y=2 are below, but we might not go there, but since we start at y=3 and go up, probably we don't go down, but to minimize time, we should only go up or stay, not down, because down would take more time to reach y=9.\n\nGoing down would increase H, so to minimize H, we should only use U or S, no D, I think.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be necessary to wait.\n\nBut let's see if we can go straight up.\n\nStart at Δt=0, y=3. Safe.\n\nNow, at Δt=0, after action, we move to next position.\n\nActions are taken at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T in 1-8, and row y_T occupied at time T, collision.\n\nTime T corresponds to Δt = T - t1.\n\nSo at turn t1 + Δt, position y_{t1 + Δt}, and we check if row y is occupied at that Δt.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions such that for each Δt from 0 to H-1, at position y_{t1 + Δt}, no collision, and at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so after H actions, we reach turn t1 + H with y=9.\n\nDefine the state at time Δt (turn t1 + Δt) position y_Δt.\n\nStart: Δt=0, y=3\n\nEnd: at some Δt=H, y_H =9\n\nFor each step, from Δt to Δt+1, we choose action at turn t1+Δt, which determines y_{Δt+1} = y_Δt + a, where a is U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nCollision check at each Δt: if y_Δt between 1 and 8, and row y_Δt occupied at time Δt.\n\nWe need y_Δt safe for all Δt from 0 to H-1? No.\n\nAt time Δt, position is y_Δt, which is set before the action? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1 + Δt, position is y_{t1 + Δt}.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t1 + Δt}, which determines y_{t1 + Δt +1} for the next turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at the time of the turn, so at turn T, position (0, y_T), and if y_T in 1-8, check if row y_T occupied at turn T.\n\nFor the sequence, at each turn T from t1 to t1 + H -1, we have position y_T, and we need no collision at that turn.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1+H} =9, and since it's the last turn, we also need no collision at turn t1+H if y_{t1+H} in 1-8, but y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSo for turns from t1 to t1+H, position y_T must be safe, and y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn t1 to t1+H-1, H actions.\n\nSet τ from 0 to H, where τ is the time offset, so turn t1 + τ for τ=0 to H.\n\nAt τ=0, position y_0=3\n\nAt τ=H, y_H=9\n\nFor each τ from 0 to H, position y_τ must be safe, meaning if y_τ in 1-8, then row y_τ not occupied at time τ.\n\nActions: at each τ from 0 to H-1, we choose a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1} = y_τ + delta y, with delta y based on action.\n\nWe need min H such that we can have a sequence from y_0=3 to y_H=9 with all y_τ safe for τ=0 to H.\n\nSince we start at y=3, end at y=9, and must go through intermediate rows, but we can stay or move up/down, but to min H, we should move up as much as possible.\n\nThe net displacement must be +6, so number of U minus number of D must be 6, and total actions H, with y in [0,9].\n\nMin H is at least 6, if all U.\n\nBut we may need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's list the occupied times for each row:\n\nRow y=3: occupied at τ=12,13,14,15 → safe for τ<12 or τ>15\n\ny=4: occupied at τ=0,1,8,9,10 → safe for τ=2,3,4,5,6,7 and τ>=11\n\ny=5: occupied only at τ=0 → safe for τ>=1\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8: occupied only at τ=0 → safe for τ>=1\n\ny=1 and y=2: occupied at τ=12-15, but since we are at y=3 and going up, we can ignore y=1 and y=2, as we won't go there to min time.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3 is safe, since occupied from τ=12.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe rows above: y=4 is occupied at τ=0 and τ=1, so at τ=0 or τ=1, if on y=4, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 occupied only at τ=0, so at τ=0, if on them, collision.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=3.\n\nNow, to move up.\n\nSuppose we try to go up immediately.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, safe.\n\nAction at τ=0: if we go U, then at τ=1, y=4.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=4, is it safe? y=4 occupied at τ=1, so collision at τ=1 if we are on y=4.\n\nIf we stay, at τ=1, y=3, which is safe since τ=1<12.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nIf we go up at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=4 is occupied, so collision.\n\nWe cannot be on y=4 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0, if we go to y=4 immediately? At τ=0, action U would set y at τ=1 to 4.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=3.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, position at τ=1 is set.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ, then action a_τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision at time τ depends on y_τ and occupation at τ.\n\nFor y=4, occupied at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, if we were on y=4, collision, but we start at y=3.\n\nAt τ=1, if y_1=4, and occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nSo, for y=4, it is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, and also at τ=8,9,10.\n\nBut at τ=0 and τ=1, we can avoid being on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, unsafe only at τ=0, but since we start at y=3, and τ=0, we are not on y=5, so for later times, y=5 is safe for τ>=1.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, back to moving.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=4, but y=4 is unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, we are not on y=4.\n\nTo be on y=4 at time τ, it must be safe at that τ.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=4 is when it is safe.\n\ny=4 safe at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7 or τ>=11.\n\nSo we can be on y=4 at τ=2, for example.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach higher rows.\n\nFirst, let's list the safe times for each row:\n\ny=3: safe for τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and τ>=16 (since occupied 12-15)\n\nBut we start at τ=0, y=3, and want to leave.\n\ny=4: safe for τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12,... (τ>=11 except 8,9,10 occupied, so τ=2-7 and τ>=11)\n\nτ=2,3,4,5,6,7 and τ>=11\n\ny=5: safe for all τ except 0, but τ=0 not possible since we start below, so safe for all τ>=1\n\nSimilarly y=6: safe for all τ>=1\n\ny=7: safe for all τ>=1\n\ny=8: safe for all τ>=1\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nTo min time, we should move up as soon as possible to y=4.\n\nBut y=4 not safe until τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=3.\n\nIf we stay at τ=0, action S, then at τ=1, y=3, still safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can do something.\n\nIf we go up at τ=1, to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, and τ=2 is safe for y=4.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could stay longer, but that increases time.\n\nSo let's go to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nNow, from y=4, we can go to y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe for all τ>=1, and since τ=2>=1, safe.\n\nSo at τ=2, y=4, we can go U to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=7, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=8, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if at each step, the position is safe.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: y=3, safe\n\nAction at τ=0: since we go to y=4 at τ=2, we need to choose actions.\n\nAt τ=0: we stay or something.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3\n\nAction: to have y=4 at τ=2, so from τ=0 to τ=1, we need to be at y=3 or something.\n\nAt τ=0, after action, y at τ=1.\n\nWe want y at τ=2 to be 4.\n\nSo at τ=1, y should be 3 or 4 or 5, but since we go to 4 at τ=2.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=3, then action U at τ=1 sets y at τ=2 to 4.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=4, but at τ=1, y=4 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=4 at τ=1.\n\nTherefore, at τ=1, we must be at y=3, then action U to go to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=0, action must set y at τ=1 to 3.\n\nSince y_0=3, if we do S at τ=0, y_1=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3, safe (since τ=1<12), then action U, so y_2=4.\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, and τ=2 is safe for y=4.\n\nThen action at τ=2: U, to y_3=5\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, safe (τ=3>=1)\n\nAction at τ=3: U, to y_4=6\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, safe\n\nAction at τ=4: U, to y_5=7\n\nAt τ=5, y=7, safe\n\nAction at τ=5: U, to y_6=8\n\nAt τ=6, y=8, safe\n\nAction at τ=6: U, to y_7=9\n\nAt τ=7, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, H=7, since we have actions from τ=0 to τ=6, 7 actions, reach at τ=7.\n\nBut minimal possible is 6, but we had to wait one turn because we couldn't go to y=4 immediately.\n\nCan we do it in 6?\n\nSuppose we go up at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=4 is occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=5 directly? But from y=3 to y=5 in one step? No, actions change by at most 1, so we must go through y=4.\n\nUnless we stay or something, but we have to go to y=4 at some point.\n\nPerhaps go down to y=2 or something, but that would take more time, not helpful.\n\ny=4 is safe at τ=2, which we used.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=4 earlier? Earliest safe is τ=2.\n\nτ=2 is the first safe time for y=4.\n\nThen we go up to y=9 in 5 more steps? From y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps up, so at least 5 actions, so from start, min H=7 actions to reach at τ=7.\n\nWith H=6 actions, we would reach at τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=6, y must be 9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=3 in 6 steps, we need all U, so y at each step: τ=0:3, τ=1:4, τ=2:5, τ=3:6, τ=4:7, τ=5:8, τ=6:9.\n\nNow check safety:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, safe\n\nAt τ=1: y=4, but τ=1, y=4 occupied, collision. Not safe.\n\nThus impossible in 6 steps.\n\nSo min H=7, as above.\n\nBut in our sequence, we have y at τ=7=9.\n\nIn the sequence I have, at τ=7, y=9.\n\nNow, but we need to check other rows.\n\nIn the sequence: τ=0: y=3 safe\n\nτ=1: y=3 safe (after S action)\n\nτ=2: y=4 safe\n\nτ=3: y=5 safe\n\nτ=4: y=6 safe\n\nτ=5: y=7 safe\n\nτ=6: y=8 safe\n\nτ=7: y=9 safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut y=8 is safe for τ>=1, τ=6>=1, yes.\n\nNow, but in the actions, we have one S at the beginning.\n\nPerhaps we can go up later, but not faster.\n\nAnother thing: y=4 is safe at τ=2, but also later, but τ=2 is earliest.\n\nBut at τ=2, we go to y=4, then up.\n\nBut after that, we go through y=5 to y=8 at τ=6.\n\ny=8 is safe at τ=6, since τ=6>=1.\n\nBut is there any issue with other rows?\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=5, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupation.\n\nAt τ=6, y=8, row y=8 occupied only at τ=0, so at τ=6, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=1, we are at y=3, which is safe, but y=3 will be occupied at τ=12, but τ=1 is fine.\n\nNow, but we need to output the actions.\n\nt1=48, so turns from 48 to 48+6=54? Actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=7 actions, from turn 48 to 54? Let's index.\n\nTurn: at turn t1 + τ for τ=0 to H, but actions at turns.\n\nSet the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=48.\n\nPosition at turn 48: y=3\n\nThen actions:\n\nAction at turn 48: determines position at turn 49.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nAt turn 48 (τ=0), position y=3, action: we did S, so stay, so position at turn 49: y=3\n\nThen at turn 49 (τ=1), position y=3, action U, so position at turn 50: y=4\n\nAt turn 50 (τ=2), position y=4, action U, position turn 51: y=5\n\nAt turn 51 (τ=3), position y=5, action U, position turn 52: y=6\n\nAt turn 52 (τ=4), position y=6, action U, position turn 53: y=7\n\nAt turn 53 (τ=5), position y=7, action U, position turn 54: y=8\n\nAt turn 54 (τ=6), position y=8, action U, position turn 55: y=9\n\nThen at turn 55, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 48 to 54, that's 7 actions: 48,49,50,51,52,53,54.\n\nReach at turn 55.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 54, we are at y=8, and action U to go to y=9 at turn 55.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure no collision.\n\nAt turn 48: τ=0, y=3, not occupied.\n\nTurn 49: τ=1, y=3, not occupied (occupied from τ=12)\n\nTurn 50: τ=2, y=4, safe since τ=2 not occupied time (occupied τ=0,1,8,9,10)\n\nTurn 51: τ=3, y=5, safe since τ=3>=1 and not τ=0\n\nSimilarly turn 52: τ=4, y=6, safe\n\nTurn 53: τ=5, y=7, safe\n\nTurn 54: τ=6, y=8, safe\n\nTurn 55: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 at τ=2, but then instead of going straight up, but going straight up seems fastest.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at τ=6, but earlier we saw it's impossible because at τ=1 y=4 is occupied.\n\nAnother idea: go down to avoid, but going down would make us reach later, not faster.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=2, but y=2 is occupied at τ=12-15, but at early times, y=2 might be safe.\n\nBut we need to go up to 9, so going down adds steps.\n\nFor instance, at τ=0, go D to y=2 at τ=1, but y=2 at τ=1 is safe? y=2 occupied τ=12-15, so at τ=1, safe. But then we are at y=2, need to go to y=9, which takes more steps, min 7 up from y=2, but we have extra down, so at least 8 actions, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nStay at y=3 for multiple turns, but then we reach later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at τ=0, then at τ=1 still y=3, then go to y=4 at τ=2 as before, same as sequence.\n\nIf we go to y=4 at τ=2, and then stay or something, but no need, since higher rows are safe.\n\nBut in our case, we go up continuously.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied at τ=8,9,10, but in our sequence, we are at y=4 at τ=2, and leave to y=5 at τ=3, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, later rows fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster to higher rows, but we have to go step by step.\n\nAnother point: at τ=0, we could go U, but to y=4 at τ=1, which is unsafe, so not possible.\n\nPerhaps at some point we can skip a row or something, but no, must move one step at a time.\n\nSo min H=7.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach at τ=6 with different path.\n\nSuppose we stay at τ=0, S, y=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of going U, we go S again? But then y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, go U to y=4 at τ=3? But at τ=3, y=4: is it safe? τ=3, y=4 safe? y=4 safe at τ=3, yes, since τ=3 is between 2-7.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=4, then U to y=5 at τ=4, and so on, to y=9 at τ=9? Worse, since we stayed extra.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt τ=1, go U to y=4 at τ=2, same as before.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps from y=3, we go to y=4 at τ=2, then to y=5 at τ=3, etc., as before.\n\nBut y=5 to y=8 can be reached quickly.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=6, we are at y=8, and go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nCan we be at y=9 at τ=6?\n\nTo be at y=9 at τ=6, we need y_6=9.\n\nFrom y_0=3, need net +6 in 6 steps, so all U: y_τ for τ=0 to 6: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nThen at τ=1, y=4, which is occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we have some S, then y increases slower, so at τ=6, y<9 if not all U.\n\nFor example, one S, then at τ=6, y=8 if we have five U and one S, but y=8 at τ=6, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=6, we must have exactly six U in six actions, no S or D, so y: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at τ=6, but y=4 at τ=1 unsafe.\n\nThus impossible to reach before τ=7.\n\nHence min H=7 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have one S at the beginning.\n\nBut in the actions, we need to output for each turn.\n\nt1=48.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 48: S (since we stay at first)\n\nThen turn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 55.\n\nIn the action sequence, from t=0 to H-1, here H=7, actions at t=48 to 54.\n\nNow, but in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 48: a_{48}\n\nTurn 49: a_{49}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 48 + 6: a_{54} since 48 to 54 is 7 turns.\n\nIndices: actions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo t from 0 to 6, turns 48 to 54.\n\na_{48} = S\n\na_{49} = U\n\na_{50} = U\n\na_{51} = U\n\na_{52} = U\n\na_{53} = U\n\na_{54} = U\n\nThen position at turn 55 is (0,9)\n\nNow, but we need to write the sequence.\n\nBut in the car states, for y=5,6,7,8, they are safe after τ=1, which we are after.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other constraints.\n\nFor example, at turn 50, which is τ=2, y=4, and we said safe.\n\nBut y=4 has cars, but at τ=2, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 51, τ=3, y=5, freeway 5 has cars, but at τ=3, not occupied, since occupied only at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut freeway 4 has multiple cars, but we checked the occupation times.\n\nAnother thing: when we are on y=4 at τ=2, the cars: for example, second car on y=4 has span at τ=2: since right-moving, car (4,-7,right,4), at Δt=2, span: [-7 + 4*2, 4 + 4*2] = [-7+8, 4+8] = [1,12], so 0 not in [1,12], good.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4), at Δt=2: [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], not.\n\nSimilarly at other times.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be boxed.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 55, with H=7 actions.\n\nBut the question is to output the actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nNow, but in the initial position, at turn t1, we are given position, so action at t1 determines next position.\n\nIn this case, we have to start with S to stay at y=3 for one turn.\n\nPerhaps we can start with U but to unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the S by going directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is safe at τ=2, but can we be at y=5 at τ=2? From y=3 at τ=0, to y=5 at τ=2, need two U, but at τ=1, we would be at y=4, which at τ=1 is occupied, so if we go U at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1, collision at τ=1.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo U at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nSo must stay at y=3 until τ=1 or later, but earliest to move up safely is to be at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThus the sequence is correct.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let's write it as per the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have seven actions, reaching at turn 55.\n\nPerhaps we can have fewer actions if we end earlier, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: what about the occupied times for y=3? But in our sequence, we leave before τ=12, so fine.\n\nIf we stayed longer, it might be problem, but we don't.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) is 7. The sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), based on the car positions and movements.\n\n### Key Points from the Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 48 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is occupied (collision risk) at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\), so the earliest safe time to be on \\(y = 4\\) is \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are occupied only at \\(\\tau = 0\\), so they are safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 3\\) is occupied at \\(\\tau = 12, 13, 14, 15\\), but the player leaves before \\(\\tau = 12\\).\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 3\\), a net increase of 6 in \\(y\\) is required. Moving directly up at \\(\\tau = 1\\) to \\(y = 4\\) causes a collision at turn 49 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)) because \\(y = 4\\) is occupied. Therefore, the player must stay at \\(y = 3\\) for one turn to avoid this collision.\n- The sequence begins with a \"Stay\" (S) action at turn 48 to remain at \\(y = 3\\) until turn 49, then moves up (U) consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 55.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 48 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe (not occupied at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- At turn 49 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 50 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), which is safe (y=4 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Actions from turn 50 to 54 (\\(\\tau = 2\\) to \\(6\\)) move up one row per turn: \\(y = 4 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 7 \\to 8 \\to 9\\). All intermediate rows are safe:\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\).\n  - \\(y = 9\\) is always safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 55 with \\(H = 7\\) actions (turns 48 to 54), which is minimal since \\(H = 6\\) is impossible due to the collision at \\(y = 4\\) on turn 49 if moving up immediately.\n\n### Output in Required Format:\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 54, and I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (+1 in y), D for down (-1 in y), or S for stay (0 change). y is between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that the car's span at that turn includes 0. The span is the position on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, it's about whether x=0 is covered by any car on the current freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I move to a different freeway at turn T, I'm not on that new freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm still on the old freeway, and I only collide if there's a car on the old freeway at x=0 at turn T. When I arrive at the new freeway at turn T+1, I need to check for collisions there at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t_1 = 54. I need to find where the cars are at future turns based on their speeds and directions.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], which I think means from τ to h, and since it's moving right, at time T, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nBut for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nAlso, for right-moving cars, head is h, tail is τ, so if direction right, head is to the right, so span is from τ (left end) to h (right end). At t_1, it's [τ, h], and at T, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end, span [h, τ] at t_1, and [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] at T.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Head -48, tail -59? But if direction right, head should be greater than tail, I think. -48 is greater than -59? -48 > -59, yes, since -48 is to the right.\n\nx-axis: negative left, positive right, I assume.\n\nSo for freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nAt t_1=54, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-54), h + s(T-54)] = [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT] where ΔT = T - 54.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) so same span.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nHead and tail: for first car, h=-48, τ=-59, right, speed 4. Span at T: [-59 + 4ΔT, -48 + 4ΔT]\n\nSecond car: h=-12, τ=-23, right, speed 4. Span at T: [-23 + 4ΔT, -12 + 4ΔT]\n\nThird car: (24, 13, right, 4). Head 24, tail 13? 13 to 24, but if direction right, head should be larger, 24>13, yes. Span at T: [13 + 4ΔT, 24 + 4ΔT]\n\nBut freeway 4 has multiple cars, so I need to check if any of them have 0 in span at time T.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, right, speed 12. Span at T: [-59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12). Head 0, tail -11, so at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5? (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 all have the same cars: one from (-59,-48) and one from (-11,0) at t_1, both right, speed 12.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 54. But y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8. So at y=0, there are no cars, so it's safe. Similarly, y=9 should be safe, but we need to reach (0,9), which might be the goal.\n\nThe grid has y from 0 to 9, but freeways are only y=1 to 8, meaning cars are only on those rows. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are always safe.\n\nThe player is at (0,0) at turn 54. I need to get to (0,9).\n\nEach turn, I can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSince I need to go from y=0 to y=9, I have to increase y by 9, so minimum turns would be 9 if I go up every turn, but I might need to avoid cars, so I might have to stay or go down sometimes, or wait.\n\nBut going down might not help since I need to go up, but sometimes to avoid a car, I might stay or move to a different y.\n\nThe collision depends on the freeway I'm on at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, then I collide if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, if I choose to move to y_{T+1}, at turn T I am still on y_T, and I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo for example, at turn 54, I am at y=0. Since y=0 has no freeway, no cars, so no collision at turn 54.\n\nIf I take action at turn 54, say U, then y_{55} = y_{54} + Δy = 0 +1 =1.\n\nAt turn 55, I am on y=1, and I need to check if at turn 55, on freeway 1, if there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, if I take S at 54, y_{55} =0, still at y=0, no collision.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so staying at y=0 won't help.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=-1, but y cannot be below 0, so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0. So D from y=0 would stay at 0, I think? Let's see the movement:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S, and y_{t+1} clamped to [0,9].\n\nSo if at y_t=0, D would try to go to -1, but since it must be in [0,9], y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t + Δy_t) or something? The problem says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t + Δy_t <0, it should be 0, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t + Δy_t >9, it should be 9.\n\nBut in this case, from y=0, D would be y_{t+1} = 0, since -1 <0. Similarly, U to 1, S to 0.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, U would stay at 9, D to 8, S to 9.\n\nBut since we start at 0 and go to 9, we don't need to worry about y=9 boundary for movement.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, I should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nSince cars are moving, I need to see when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = T - 54, so at turn T, time since start.\n\nFor each freeway, find when 0 is covered by a car span.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, span at T: [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT\n\nSo -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 => 3ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 59/3 = 19.666, so ΔT ≤ 19 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT => 48 ≤ 3ΔT => ΔT ≥ 16\n\nSo for ΔT from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nΔT = T - 54, so at T=54+16=70 to T=54+19=73, freeway 1 has a car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, same thing, unsafe from T=70 to 73.\n\nFreeway 3: same, unsafe T=70 to 73.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4), span at T: [-59 + 4ΔT, -48 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4ΔT\n\n-59 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 14.75, so ΔT ≤ 14\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 4ΔT => 48 ≤ 4ΔT => ΔT ≥ 12\n\nSo for ΔT=12,13,14\n\nAt T=54+12=66,67,68\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4), span at T: [-23 + 4ΔT, -12 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -23 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 4ΔT\n\nFirst: -23 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 5.75, so ΔT ≤ 5\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 + 4ΔT => 12 ≤ 4ΔT => ΔT ≥ 3\n\nSo ΔT=3,4,5\n\nT=54+3=57,58,59\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4), span at T: [13 + 4ΔT, 24 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 13 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 4ΔT? But 13 + 4ΔT is always positive for ΔT ≥0, since 13>0, so 0 cannot be in [positive, positive], so never covers x=0. So safe for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 4, unsafe when first car or second car has 0.\n\nFirst car unsafe at ΔT=12,13,14 → T=66,67,68\n\nSecond car unsafe at ΔT=3,4,5 → T=57,58,59\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 unsafe at T=57,58,59,66,67,68\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at T: [-59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT => 48 ≤ 12ΔT => ΔT ≥ 4\n\nSo ΔT ≥4 and ΔT ≤4, so only ΔT=4\n\nT=54+4=58\n\nAt T=58, unsafe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), span at T: [-11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 11 => ΔT ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so ΔT ≤ 0\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 12ΔT => ΔT ≥ 0\n\nSo ΔT ≥0 and ΔT ≤0, so only ΔT=0, T=54\n\nAt T=54, this car has span [-11 + 0, 0] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, since tail is at 0? Head is 0, tail -11, so at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-11,0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nBut at T=54, the player is at y=0, not on freeway 5. Freeway 5 is at y=5, I think.\n\nFreeway k is for y=k, I assume.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, and y from 1 to 8.\n\nSo at turn T, if player is on y=k, then check cars on that freeway k.\n\nAt T=54, player is at y=0, not on any freeway, so no collision.\n\nFor freeway 5, second car at T=54: span [-11,0], so if player were on y=5 at T=54, it would collide, but player is not.\n\nBut at ΔT=0, T=54, it is unsafe for freeway 5 if player is there, but at T=54, player is at y=0.\n\nNow for the span: 0 in span at T for ΔT=0 only.\n\nSince ΔT=0, only at T=54.\n\nFor other times, let's see.\n\n0 in span for second car: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nAs above, only when ΔT=0.\n\nFor ΔT=1, span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=1, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT<0, but we start from T=54, so not relevant.\n\nSo only unsafe at T=54 for freeway 5, second car.\n\nBut since at T=54 player is not on y=5, it's fine.\n\nFirst car unsafe only at ΔT=4, T=58.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe at T=58 (from first car), and also at T=54 from second car, but T=54 is past when we consider.\n\nNow for the sequence, we start at T=54, player at y=0.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position (0, y_T), and after action, y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_T with 0 in span at T.\n\nFor freeway 5, at T=54, it is unsafe, but y_T must be 5 to collide, which it's not.\n\nAt T=58, unsafe if on y=5.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow back to freeway 5: unsafe at T=58.\n\nAlso, the second car is only unsafe at T=54, which is not relevant for future.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at T=58.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, I think.\n\nFreeway 6: cars (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSame as freeway 5.\n\nSo unsafe at T=58 for the first car.\n\nSecond car unsafe only at T=54.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 all have the same cars.\n\nNow freeway 1,2,3 unsafe at T=70 to 73.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=57,58,59 and 66,67,68.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8: for each, unsafe at T=58.\n\nFor freeway 5: at T=58, first car span: ΔT=4, [-59 + 12*4, -48 + 12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so [ -11, 0], which includes 0.\n\nSecond car at T=58: ΔT=4, [-11 + 12*4, 12*4] = [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only from first car.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo summary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe T=70,71,72,73\n\n- y=2: same, T=70-73\n\n- y=3: same, T=70-73\n\n- y=4: unsafe T=57,58,59,66,67,68\n\n- y=5: unsafe T=58\n\n- y=6: unsafe T=58\n\n- y=7: unsafe T=58\n\n- y=8: unsafe T=58\n\ny=5 to 8 all unsafe only at T=58.\n\nNow, the player starts at T=54, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe.\n\nThe minimal path to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves up, but with possible stays or downs to avoid collisions.\n\nBut downs might not help since we need to go up.\n\nI should go up as fast as possible, but be at unsafe positions only when it's safe.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action to change y.\n\nLet me denote the turn from T=54 onwards.\n\nAt T=54: position y=0. Safe, since no freeway.\n\nI can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, go to y=1 at T=55.\n\nIf S, stay at y=0 at T=55.\n\nIf D, also stay at y=0.\n\nSince I need to go up, I should go U when possible.\n\nBut I need to check when I arrive at each y.\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nI want to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut I might need to wait at some safe y to avoid being on an unsafe freeway at bad time.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I can stay there.\n\nBut y=0 is start, y=9 is goal.\n\nThe unsafe times are concentrated around T=58 and later.\n\nT=58 is soon.\n\nFirst, at T=54: I am at y=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at T=55 by taking U at T=54.\n\nAction at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I take action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, and check collision for that position at turn T+1.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 54: at y=0, take action a_{54}.\n\nThen y_{55} = y_{54} + Δy_{54}\n\nAt turn 55, position y_{55}, if y_{55} between 1 and 8, check if freeway y_{55} has car with 0 in span at T=55.\n\nSimilarly for next turns.\n\nStart at T=54, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start, so after H-1 actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, I think.\n\nGiven: sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 =54, so actions a_{54}, a_{55}, ..., a_{54 + H -1}\n\nAfter these H actions, we have y_{54 + H} = y after H actions.\n\nStart at turn 54, position (0, y_{54}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{54}, at turn 55, position (0, y_{55})\n\nAfter action a_{55}, at turn 56, position (0, y_{56})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{54 + H -1}, at turn 54 + H, position (0, y_{54 + H})\n\nWe want y_{54 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn 54 + H.\n\nAt that turn, if y=9, no collision, safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimum possible H is 9, if we go up every turn: from y=0 to y=1 at T=55, y=2 at T=56, ..., y=9 at T=64.\n\nT=54: y=0\n\nAfter a_{54}, T=55: y=1\n\na_{55}, T=56: y=2\n\n...\n\na_{62}, T=63: y=9? Let's count.\n\nAt T=54, y=0\n\nAfter first action (t=0), T=55, y=1\n\nAfter second action (t=1), T=56, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action, T=54 + k, y = k\n\nSet y = k at T=54 + k\n\nFor y=9, k=9, so at T=54+9=63, y=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=8, H=9 actions, reach at T=63.\n\nNow, is this path safe?\n\nCheck each turn when on freeway.\n\nAt T=55, y=1: freeway 1, at T=55, ΔT=1, T-54=1\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only from T=70-73, so at T=55, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=56, y=2: freeway 2, same, safe.\n\nT=57, y=3: freeway 3, should be safe, unsafe only later.\n\nT=57: ΔT=3, freeway 3 unsafe from 70-73, so yes safe.\n\nT=58, y=4: freeway 4, at T=58.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=57,58,59,66,67,68.\n\nT=58 is unsafe.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt T=58, if y=4, it is unsafe.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=58, y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot go directly up at that time.\n\nNeed to avoid being on y=4 at T=58.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe points.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nT=55, y=1: safe\n\nT=56, y=2: safe\n\nT=57, y=3: safe\n\nT=58, y=4: unsafe, as above.\n\nSo need to do something else.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=3 for one turn or something.\n\nSince y=5 to 8 are unsafe only at T=58, but at T=58, if I am on y=5,6,7, or 8, it is unsafe.\n\nBut only at T=58, for y=5-8.\n\ny=4 unsafe at multiple times.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nI could go slower or wait at safe y.\n\nFor example, at T=57, instead of going to y=4, I could stay at y=3 or go down, but going down not useful.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, I could stay at y=0 for some turns, but that delays.\n\nBetter to go to a safe y and wait.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=70-73\n\nBut we are going to reach before that, since min H=9, T=63, before 70, so y=1,2,3 are safe at early times.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=57,58,59 and 66,67,68\n\nFor min path, T=57,58,59 are around our time.\n\ny=5-8 unsafe only at T=58.\n\nT=58 is a critical point.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=4 at T=58, unsafe.\n\nIf I can be at a different y at T=58.\n\nFor example, at T=57, if I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=57, I could take S, so at T=58, still y=3, which is safe, since y=3 unsafe only later.\n\nThen at T=58, I take U, to go to y=4 at T=59.\n\nBut T=59, y=4, freeway 4 unsafe at T=59? Yes, T=59 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at 57,58,59.\n\nSo at T=59, y=4 still unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at T=59, unsafe.\n\nPerhaps go to y=5 at some time.\n\nLet's see possible paths.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=4 during T=57,58,59.\n\nSimilarly, avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at T=58.\n\nAnd later avoid y=4 at 66-68, but since we can reach by T=63-65, later times are not issue, as min H=9, T=63, which is before 66.\n\nT=66 is 54+12=66, yes after 63.\n\nSince min T to reach is 63, and 63<66, so for now, we only care about times up to say 65, and unsafe times before that are T=57,58,59 for y=4 and T=58 for y=5-8.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe until later.\n\nNow, y=9 safe always.\n\nI could reach y=9 before T=58? But from y=0, to y=9 in 9 steps, min T=63, which is after 58.\n\nT=63 is 54+9=63, ΔT=9.\n\nT=58 is 54+4=58? T=54, ΔT=0; T=55, ΔT=1; ... T=58, ΔT=4.\n\nT=63, ΔT=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSince T=58 is a problem, and I need to be at some y at T=58 that is safe.\n\nWhat y are safe at T=58?\n\ny=0: safe, no freeway.\n\ny=1: at T=58, ΔT=4, freeway 1 unsafe only at 70-73, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=58.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=58.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 unsafe at T=58.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut at T=58, if I am at y=9, but I cannot be at y=9 so early.\n\nMin turn to be at y=9 is T=63 if no delay.\n\nAt T=58, the safe positions are y=0,1,2,3,9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable yet.\n\ny=0,1,2,3 are safe.\n\nNow, in the path, I need to be at one of these at T=58.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=3 at T=58, safe.\n\nThen I can proceed up.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=2 or y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut since I need to go up, being at lower y might require more steps.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at T=54, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some T.\n\nMin H=9, T=63.\n\nBut with delay, H>9.\n\nNow, at T=54, I take action.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=1 at T=55.\n\nT=55, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=55, I can go to y=2 at T=56, safe.\n\nT=56, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=56, I can go to y=3 at T=57, safe.\n\nNow at T=57, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to decide action at T=57.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at T=58, but y=4 unsafe at T=58.\n\nIf I take S, stay at y=3 at T=58, safe.\n\nThen at T=58, y=3, I can take U to go to y=4 at T=59.\n\nBut T=59, y=4, freeway 4 unsafe at T=59? Yes, as per earlier.\n\nSo unsafe.\n\nIf I take D at T=57, go to y=2 at T=58, which is safe, but then I am lower.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nAt T=57, y=3, I could take U to go to y=4 at T=58, unsafe, not good.\n\nSo better to stay at T=57, S, so at T=58, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=58, y=3, I need to take action.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at T=59.\n\nBut T=59, y=4 is unsafe, as freeway 4 unsafe at 59.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=3 at T=59.\n\ny=3 safe at T=59.\n\nThen at T=59, I can go U to y=4 at T=60.\n\nNow T=60, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=57,58,59,66,67,68.\n\nT=60 is not in unsafe times, so should be safe.\n\nConfirm: for freeway 4, unsafe at T=57,58,59,66,67,68.\n\nT=60 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=60, y=4, I can go U to y=5 at T=61.\n\nNow T=61, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe only at T=58, so at T=61, safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=6 at T=62, y=6 safe since not T=58.\n\nT=62, y=6, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at T=63, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at T=64, now T=64, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe only at T=58, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at T=65.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at T=65.\n\nNow, what about the earlier part.\n\nIn this sequence, I had some delays.\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=54: y=0, take U? Let's list actions.\n\nAt T=54, take action for y_{55}.\n\nI took U at T=54 to go to y=1 at T=55.\n\nThen U at T=55 to y=2 at T=56.\n\nU at T=56 to y=3 at T=57.\n\nAt T=57, take S, so y_{58} = y_{57} + 0 = 3.\n\nAt T=58, y=3, take S? In my plan, at T=58, I stayed or what.\n\nAfter T=58, y=3, I need to go to y=4 at T=60 or something.\n\nAt T=58, y=3, I can take action.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=4 at T=59, but unsafe.\n\nSo I need to wait.\n\nTake S at T=58, so y_{59} =3.\n\nThen at T=59, y=3, take U to y=4 at T=60.\n\nT=60, y=4, safe.\n\nThen U at T=60 to y=5 at T=61.\n\nU at T=61 to y=6 at T=62.\n\nU at T=62 to y=7 at T=63.\n\nU at T=63 to y=8 at T=64.\n\nU at T=64 to y=9 at T=65.\n\nBut at T=65, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, the turn when we reach y=9 is T=65.\n\nH: from T=54 to T=65, that's 11 turns? T=54 to T=65 is 12 positions, but number of actions.\n\nStart at T=54, after H actions, at T=54+H.\n\nSet T_final = 54 + H.\n\nAt T_final, y=9.\n\nIn this case, T_final=65, so 54 + H =65, H=11.\n\nActions from a_{54} to a_{64}, 11 actions? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nActions: a_{54} to a_{54 + H -1}, after that at T=54 + H.\n\nSo for H=11, actions a_{54} to a_{64}, reach at T=65.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn this sequence, I stayed at y=3 for two extra turns: at T=58 and T=59, I was at y=3.\n\nBut at T=59, I went to y=4 at T=60.\n\nI could go to y=4 earlier or later.\n\nFreeway 4 is safe after T=59 until T=66.\n\nT=60 to T=65 are safe for y=4, except T=66 but we pass before.\n\nT=60,61,62,63,64,65 all fine for y=4 except if we are there at T=66, but not.\n\nNow, at T=57, I am at y=3.\n\nInstead of staying, I could go directly to y=4 at T=58, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 at some point, avoiding y=4 at bad times.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at T=58.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=5 at T=59 or something.\n\nBut to reach y=5, I need to go through y=4.\n\nUnless I skip, but I have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: at T=57, y=3, I could go down to y=2 at T=58, but that seems worse.\n\nThen I have to come back up.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps start slower.\n\nFor example, at T=54, take S, stay at y=0 at T=55.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut delaying at start might not help.\n\nLet's see if I can reach by T=64 or earlier.\n\nMin possible T to reach y=9 is T=63 with 9 ups.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe points.\n\nThe unsafe period is around T=58.\n\nI need to not be on y=4 during T=57-59, and not on y=5-8 at T=58.\n\nSince y=5-8 only unsafe at T=58, if I can be on them at other times, fine.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=59, for example.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's list the times I can be on each y safely.\n\nFor y=4: unsafe at T=57,58,59, so safe at T=55,56,60,61,62,63,64,... until 66.\n\nT=55: y=4, but at T=55, ΔT=1, freeway 4: unsafe at T=57,58,59, so T=55 safe? T=55 not in unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly T=56 safe.\n\nT=60 safe, etc.\n\ny=5: unsafe only at T=58, so safe at all other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe at least until T=69 or something, but we reach early.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nI need to be at y=4 at some safe time, say T=56 or T=60, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nEarliest: go up from start.\n\nT=54: y=0, take U, to y=1 at T=55\n\nT=55: y=1, take U, to y=2 at T=56\n\nT=56: y=2, take U, to y=3 at T=57\n\nNow at T=57, y=3.\n\nI cannot go to y=4 at T=58 because unsafe.\n\nI can stay at y=3 at T=58 by taking S at T=57.\n\nBut then at T=58, y=3.\n\nThen I cannot go to y=4 at T=59 because y=4 unsafe at T=59.\n\nSo I must stay at y=3 at T=59 as well? Take S at T=58.\n\nThen at T=59, y=3, take U to y=4 at T=60, safe.\n\nBut I stayed two turns.\n\nIf at T=57, I take U, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nPerhaps go to y=4 earlier.\n\nAt T=56, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=3 at T=57, same as before.\n\nIf at T=56, I take S, stay at y=2 at T=57.\n\nThen at T=57, y=2, I can take U to y=3 at T=58.\n\nT=58, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=58, y=3, I can take U to y=4 at T=59, but y=4 unsafe at T=59.\n\nSame problem.\n\nThen I have to stay at y=3 at T=59 or go to y=4 later.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=5 from y=3 or something, but I can only move one step, so must go through y=4.\n\nAnother idea: at T=57, y=3, I take D to go to y=2 at T=58.\n\nThen at T=58, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=58, I can take U to y=3 at T=59.\n\nThen at T=59, y=3, take U to y=4 at T=60, safe.\n\nBut this is worse, I went down and up, more delay.\n\nSo better to stay at y=3 for two turns, as in first plan.\n\nBut in that case, I reach y=9 at T=65 with H=11 actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=4 before T=57.\n\nFor example, at T=55, if I am at y=1, I could go to y=2 at T=56, y=3 at T=57, but to y=4 at T=58 unsafe.\n\nIf I go faster at beginning.\n\nFrom T=54, y=0, take U to y=1 at T=55.\n\nThen at T=55, take U to y=2 at T=56.\n\nAt T=56, instead of U to y=3, I take U to y=3 at T=57, same.\n\nI can't skip.\n\nStart by staying at y=0 for one turn.\n\nT=54, take S, so y_{55}=0.\n\nThen at T=55, y=0, take U to y=1 at T=56.\n\nThen U to y=2 at T=57.\n\nU to y=3 at T=58.\n\nT=58, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=58, take U to y=4 at T=59, but unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nThen I need to stay at T=58, S, y_{59}=3.\n\nThen U at T=59 to y=4 at T=60.\n\nSame as before, but I started slower, so even later.\n\nT=54 S, T=55 y=0? At T=55, y=0.\n\nThen U at T=55 to y=1 at T=56.\n\nU at T=56 to y=2 at T=57.\n\nU at T=57 to y=3 at T=58.\n\nS at T=58 to stay y=3 at T=59? At T=58, take S, so y_{59}=3.\n\nThen U at T=59 to y=4 at T=60.\n\nThen U to y=5 at T=61, etc to y=9 at T=65, same as before but started with a stay, so one more action.\n\nH larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nTo avoid the unsafe y=4 at T=59, I need to be at y=4 at a different time.\n\nEarliest safe time for y=4 is T=56 or before.\n\nT=55: y=4 possible?\n\nAt T=55, to be at y=4, I need to have moved faster.\n\nFrom start: T=54 y=0, U to y=1 at T=55.\n\nBut at T=55, I am at y=1, not y=4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at T=55, I need to have been at y=3 at T=54, but at T=54 I am at y=0, impossible.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=4 is T=57: if I go up each step.\n\nT=54 U to y=1 T=55\n\nU to y=2 T=56\n\nU to y=3 T=57\n\nU to y=4 T=58, but unsafe.\n\nNext possible is T=60, as in the plan.\n\nBut at T=60, y=4.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut from y=4 at T=60 to y=9 at T=65, that's 5 steps: y=5 at T=61, y=6 T=62, y=7 T=63, y=8 T=64, y=9 T=65.\n\nNow, what about y=5 to 8 at T=61 to 64, all safe since not T=58.\n\ny=8 at T=64, fine.\n\nBut at T=58, where was I? In the sequence, I was at y=3 at T=58 and T=59.\n\nT=58 and T=59 both at y=3.\n\nBut at T=59, I went to y=4 at T=60.\n\nCould I reach y=9 earlier than T=65?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=4 at T=60, but then y=9 at T=65.\n\nIf I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nSuppose at T=57, I am at y=3.\n\nInstead of staying, I go to y=4 at T=58, unsafe, not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=5 is safe except at T=58, if I can be at y=5 at T=59.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=59, I need to be at y=4 at T=58, but at T=58, y=4 is unsafe, so I cannot be there to move to y=5.\n\nThe move: at turn T, I am at y_T, take action a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=5 at T=59, I must have been at y=4 or y=5 or y=6 at T=58, and taken action to go to y=5.\n\nBut if I was at y=4 at T=58, and take U, go to y=5 at T=59.\n\nBut at T=58, if I am on y=4, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I was at y=5 at T=58 and take S or D, but at T=58, y=5 is unsafe for freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 at T=58, all unsafe.\n\nThe only way to be at y=5 at T=59 is to come from y=4 at T=58 with U, but y=4 at T=58 unsafe, so impossible to be on y=5 at T=59 without having been on an unsafe position.\n\nUnless I come from y=6 with D, but that means I was at y=6 at T=58, which is unsafe for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, all ways to be on y=5 at T=59 require being on y=4,5,6 at T=58, all of which are unsafe except y=4,5,6,7,8 are all unsafe at T=58.\n\ny=4 unsafe, y=5-8 unsafe at T=58.\n\ny=3 is safe at T=58, but from y=3, I can go to y=4, not directly to y=5.\n\nSo it is impossible to be on y=5 at T=59, because to reach it, I must have been on a freeway at T=58 that is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6 at T=59, same issue.\n\nIn fact, at T=58, all freeways y=4 to 8 are unsafe, so I must be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9 at T=58 to be safe.\n\nSince y=9 not reachable, I must be on y=0,1,2, or 3 at T=58.\n\nSimilarly, at T=59, for y=4, it is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=4 at T=59.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on y=4 at T=59.\n\nIn the sequence, I was at y=3 at T=58 and T=59, then to y=4 at T=60.\n\nNow, can I be at y=4 earlier than T=60?\n\nFor example, at T=56.\n\nTo be at y=4 at T=56: need to have y=4 at T=56.\n\nFrom start: T=54 U to y=1 T=55, U to y=2 T=56? At T=55, y=1, U to y=2 at T=56, not y=4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at T=56, I need to be at y=3 at T=55, but at T=55, I can be at y=1 if started normally, impossible to be at y=4 at T=56.\n\nEarliest T for y=4 is T=57 with direct up, but unsafe, or T=60 with delay.\n\nSimilarly, T=57 not possible because unsafe.\n\nSo T=60 is the earliest I can be at y=4 safely.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 at T=65.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart:\n\nTurn 54: at y=0, take U, so y_{55} =1\n\nTurn 55: at y=1, take U, y_{56}=2\n\nTurn 56: at y=2, take U, y_{57}=3\n\nNow turn 57: at y=3, need to take action. Take S, so y_{58}=3\n\nTurn 58: at y=3, take S? In my earlier, I took S at T=58 to stay at y=3 for T=59.\n\nAt turn 58, take S, so y_{59}=3\n\nThen turn 59: at y=3, take U, y_{60}=4\n\nNow y=4 at T=60, safe.\n\nThen turn 60: at y=4, take U, y_{61}=5\n\nTurn 61: at y=5, take U, y_{62}=6\n\nTurn 62: at y=6, take U, y_{63}=7\n\nTurn 63: at y=7, take U, y_{64}=8\n\nTurn 64: at y=8, take U, y_{65}=9\n\nNow at T=65, y=9, reached.\n\nH=11 actions? Actions from a_{54} to a_{64}, that's 11 actions: t=0 to 10, H=11.\n\na_{54} to a_{64} is 11 actions: indices 54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64? 54 to 64 inclusive is 11 terms.\n\n54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64: yes 11 actions.\n\nReach at T=65.\n\nBut at T=64, y=8, which is freeway 8, and we need to check if safe.\n\nT=64, ΔT=10, freeway 8: unsafe only at T=58, so safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut can I reduce H?\n\nFor example, at turn 58, instead of taking S, can I go up?\n\nBut to y=4 at T=59, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps from y=3 at T=58, I go down to y=2 at T=59, but then I have to come back, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe at T=57, for example.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=57.\n\nBut from start, T=54 y=0, U to y=1 T=55, U to y=2 T=56, U to y=3 T=57? At T=57, y=3 if I go up.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=57, impossible, since min T for y=5 is T=59 with delays.\n\nT=57 y=3 is best.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at T=58, but y=8 unsafe at T=58, and I can't reach that early.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal with this path.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by T=64.\n\nAt T=64, y=9.\n\nThat means y_{64}=9.\n\nSo I must be at y=8 at T=63, and take U.\n\nOr at y=9 at T=63 with S, but need to reach.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=64, I need y_{64}=9.\n\nSo at T=63, position y=8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 not possible, so y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y=8 at T=63, take U to y=9 at T=64.\n\nIf y=9 at T=63, take S to y=9 at T=64.\n\nBut to reach early, better to be at y=8 at T=63.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at T=63, need to be at y=7 or 8 or 9 at T=62.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at T=63, for example.\n\nBut y=8 at T=63 is safe, since not T=58.\n\nNow, what about the lower parts.\n\nThe constraint is around y=4 at T=57-59.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=4 at T=60, as before.\n\nThen y=5 at T=61, y=6 T=62, y=7 T=63, y=8 T=64, y=9 T=65.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=63, I need to be at y=7 at T=62 or something.\n\nSet back.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=63: need to have y=7 at T=62 with U, or y=8 at T=62 with S, or y=9 with D, but not.\n\nSo y=7 at T=62, take U to y=8 at T=63.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=62: need y=6 at T=61 with U, etc.\n\ny=6 at T=61: from y=5 at T=60 with U.\n\ny=5 at T=60: from y=4 at T=59 with U.\n\nBut at T=59, y=4 is unsafe, as per freeway 4 at T=59.\n\ny=4 at T=59 unsafe, so I cannot be there to move to y=5.\n\nIf I am at y=5 at T=59, but to be at y=5 at T=59, I need to come from y=4 at T=58 with U, but y=4 at T=58 unsafe, or from y=6 with D, y=6 at T=58 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=5 at T=59.\n\nSimilarly, impossible to be on any of y=4,5,6,7,8 at T=58 or T=59 for y=4.\n\nSpecifically, at T=59, y=4 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=4 at T=59.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be at y=4 is T=60, as before.\n\nThen y=5 at T=61, y=6 T=62, y=7 T=63, y=8 T=64, y=9 T=65.\n\nIf I can be at a higher y at T=60.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at T=60, for example.\n\nNeed to be at y=4 or 5 or 6 at T=59.\n\nBut at T=59, y=4 unsafe, y=5: if I could be, but y=5 at T=59 requires being on freeway at T=59, which is unsafe only if on y=5 at that time, but y=5 is unsafe only at T=58, not at T=59.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at T=58, so at T=59, y=5 is safe.\n\nBut can I be at y=5 at T=59?\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=59, I must have been at y=4 at T=58 with U, or y=5 at T=58 with S, or y=6 at T=58 with D.\n\nBut at T=58, y=4,5,6 are all unsafe (y=4,5,6,7,8).\n\nSpecifically, y=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, etc.\n\nSo if I was at y=4 at T=58, I collide, cannot take action.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=5 at T=58, collide.\n\ny=6 at T=58, collide.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=5 at T=59 because I would have to come from an unsafe position at T=58.\n\nHence, it is impossible to be on y=5 before T=60 or later.\n\nSimilarly for other ys.\n\nThe only safe way is to be on y=0,1,2,3 at T=58 and T=59.\n\nThen at T=59, I can go to y=4 at T=60, etc.\n\nThus minimal H is 11, reaching at T=65.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two stays at y=3.\n\nBut let's write the actions as required.\n\nStart at turn 54: position y=0.\n\nAction a_{54}: to go to y=1, so U\n\nThen turn 55: at y=1, action a_{55}: U to y=2\n\nTurn 56: at y=2, action a_{56}: U to y=3\n\nTurn 57: at y=3, action a_{57}: S to stay at y=3 for next turn\n\nAfter a_{57}, at turn 58, y=3\n\nThen turn 58: at y=3, action a_{58}: S to stay at y=3 for next turn? In my sequence, I took S at T=58 to stay at y=3 for T=59.\n\nThen at turn 59: at y=3, action a_{59}: U to go to y=4 at next turn\n\nAfter a_{59}, turn 60, y=4\n\nTurn 60: at y=4, action a_{60}: U to y=5\n\nTurn 61: at y=5, action a_{61}: U to y=6\n\nTurn 62: at y=6, action a_{62}: U to y=7\n\nTurn 63: at y=7, action a_{63}: U to y=8\n\nTurn 64: at y=8, action a_{64}: U to y=9\n\nNow at turn 65, y=9.\n\nActions from a_{54} to a_{64}, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 58, I took S, but I could take other action, but not useful.\n\nSince at T=58 I am at y=3, and I need to go up later, but I have to wait until T=60 to go to y=4.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 from another y, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at T=59, if I am at y=3, I go U to y=4 at T=60.\n\nBut at T=59, y=3 is safe, and going to y=4 at T=60.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=4 at T=59? No, unsafe.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can save one turn.\n\nSuppose at T=58, I am at y=3, instead of taking S, I take U, but then y_{59}=4, which is at T=59, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTake D to y=2 at T=59, but then I have to go back up, so at T=59, y=2, then U to y=3 at T=60, then U to y=4 at T=61, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo H=11 seems best.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there is also unsafe at T=66,67,68, but since we reach by T=65, before that, no issue.\n\nSimilarly for y=1-3 unsafe later, not issue.\n\nNow, about the second car on freeway 5 etc., but only at T=58, which we avoided.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to y=5 at T=61, etc., all safe.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nH=11, actions from t=0 to 10 relative to t_1.\n\nt_1=54.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nAfter a_{64}, at turn 65, y=9.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nAlso, for freeway 4, at T=60, y=4, is it safe? T=60, not in unsafe times, yes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 at T=56.\n\nBut how? To be at y=4 at T=56, I need to have been at y=3 at T=55.\n\nAt T=55, to be at y=3, need from y=2 at T=54 with U, but at T=54, y=0, U to y=1 at T=55, not y=3.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two S at turn 57 and 58.\n\nBut at turn 58, I could take other action, but S is fine.\n\nSince y=1,2,3 are safe, I could be at different y, but no benefit.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut the player position is given at (0,0) at turn t_1=54.\n\nWe need to output the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=11, so turns 54 to 64.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nIn the output format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U\nTurn 56: a_{56} = U\nTurn 57: a_{57} = S\nTurn 58: a_{58} = S\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U\nTurn 62: a_{62} = U\nTurn 63: a_{63} = U\nTurn 64: a_{64} = U\n}\n\nBut a_{64} leads to y=9 at turn 65.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at T=60, but then to y=9 at T=65.\n\nIf I can go faster after, but no.\n\nAt T=59, I am at y=3, I take U to y=4 at T=60.\n\nBut at T=59, if I could be at higher, but not.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe at all times except T=58, if I can reach y=5 quickly.\n\nBut to reach y=5, I must go through y=4 at some point, which I can only do safely at T=60 or later.\n\nFor example, at T=60 y=4, U to y=5 T=61.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=0 or y=1 longer, but that might allow me to skip the wait, but I don't think so.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=0 until later, then go up, but the unsafe times are fixed, so I still have to avoid being on y=4 at 57-59 and y=5-8 at 58.\n\nBut since T=58 is critical, I need to be low at that time.\n\nIn my sequence, I am at y=3 at T=58 and T=59.\n\nIf I am at y=2 at T=58, that's fine, but then I have to go up to y=3, then to y=4, same as before but from lower, might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=58, y=2, then U to y=3 at T=59, then U to y=4 at T=60, same as before but I was at y=3 earlier.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=4, still at T=60.\n\nThen same.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 54\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at critical times, particularly around turn 58.\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) are unsafe at turns 70 to 73, but these are after the player reaches the goal, so no issue.\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe at turns 57, 58, 59, 66, 67, 68. Since the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 65, only turns 57-59 are relevant.\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are unsafe only at turn 58.\n\nTo avoid collisions:\n- The player must not be on \\(y = 4\\) at turns 57, 58, 59.\n- The player must not be on \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn 58.\n- The earliest safe time to be on \\(y = 4\\) is turn 60, as turns 57-59 are unsafe and earlier turns are not feasible from the start position.\n\nThe sequence is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 57.\n- Stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turns 58 and 59 to avoid being on unsafe freeways (\\(y = 4\\) at turn 59 and \\(y = 5-8\\) at turn 58).\n- Move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 60 (safe).\n- Then move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 65, as all freeways \\(y = 5-8\\) are safe except at turn 58 (already avoided).\n\nActions:\n- At turn 54: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 55 (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is not unsafe at turn 55).\n- At turn 55: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 56 (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is not unsafe at turn 56).\n- At turn 56: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57 (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is not unsafe at turn 57).\n- At turn 57: Stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 58 (safe, and avoids moving to unsafe \\(y = 4\\) at turn 58).\n- At turn 58: Stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 59 (safe, and avoids moving to unsafe \\(y = 4\\) at turn 59).\n- At turn 59: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 60 (safe, as turn 60 is not unsafe for \\(y = 4\\)).\n- At turn 60: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 61 (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) is not unsafe at turn 61).\n- At turn 61: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 62 (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is not unsafe at turn 62).\n- At turn 62: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 63 (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is not unsafe at turn 63).\n- At turn 63: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 64 (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is not unsafe at turn 64).\n- At turn 64: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 65 (goal reached, safe as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis sequence takes 11 turns, and \\(H = 11\\) is minimal because:\n- It is impossible to be on \\(y = 4\\) before turn 60 without collision (turns 57-59 are unsafe).\n- It is impossible to skip \\(y = 4\\) or reach higher y-values faster due to the movement constraints.\n- Any deviation (e.g., moving down or staying longer at lower y-values) increases \\(H\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: U \\\\\nTurn 57: S \\\\\nTurn 58: S \\\\\nTurn 59: U \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=58, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, the car on that row doesn't have 0 in its span at that turn because that's when collision occurs.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the car's span for the freeway I'm on at that turn. And importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on row y, and at turn T+1 I'm on row y+1.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so the action at turn t determines y_{t+1}. So at turn t, I'm on row y_t, and I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen for collision: at turn T, I'm on row y_T, and I check if for that row, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe note clarifies: if I move to a different row at turn T, I'm not on that new row until turn T+1, so I only care about the car on my current row at the current turn.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=3 at turn t₁=58.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is the top row, I think y=0 to 9, so y=9 is the goal.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe, as there are no cars on them, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be car-free.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are safe.\n\nMy initial position is (0,3), so at turn 58, I'm on y=3.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning the number of actions, I think. Let's see.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, so after H actions, I reach y_{t₁ + H}, and I want y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so from turn t₁ to t₁ + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe player position at turn t is (0, y_t), and after action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t₁, I'm at y_{t₁} = 3.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, I go to y_{t₁ +1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, I am at y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 relative, so turns t₁ to t₁ + H - 1.\n\nAnd at turn t₁ + H, I reach y=9.\n\nNow, I need to minimize H, the number of actions.\n\nSince I start at y=3 and need to go to y=9, the minimum possible without cars is 6 moves up, so H=6 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut there are cars, so I might need to detour or wait.\n\nI can also go down or stay, but since I need to go up, going down might not help, but sometimes to avoid cars, I might need to go down temporarily.\n\nBut in this case, since I start at 3 and need to go to 9, and rows below might have cars, but y=0 is safe, so going down to 0 might be an option if needed.\n\nBut let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car movements over time.\n\nThe cars are given at turn t₁=58.\n\nFor each car, I have head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]? Let's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: at turn t₁, span is [h, τ], but it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and for left-moving, it says span(t₁) = [h, τ], then at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)].\n\nBut if it's left-moving, head should be decreasing, so if [h, τ] at t₁, and it moves left, so positions decrease, so at T, it should be [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], where ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t₁) = [τ, h]? It says \"span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? Let's see.\n\nIt says: \"Right-moving: [Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nNow, for right-moving, the head is at h, tail at τ, and since it's moving right, head should be to the right, so if direction is right, head should be greater than tail, I assume.\n\nHere, head = -36, tail = -47, so -36 > -47, so head is at higher position, so for right-moving, it makes sense, span is from τ to h, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? But in the notation, it says (head, tail), and for right, span is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=3.\n\nSince dir=right, head is at -36, tail at -47, so the car spans from -47 to -36, I think, because it's moving right, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, it says span(t₁) = [τ, h], which would be [tail, head], so for this, [-47, -36].\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-47 + 3(T-58), -36 + 3(T-58)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars given are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, all right\n\nFreeway 5: two cars, both right\n\nFreeway 6: both right\n\nFreeway 7: both right\n\nFreeway 8: both right\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow for freeway 4, there are three cars: (-32,-43,right,4), (4,-7,right,4), (40,29,right,4)\n\n(40,29,right,4): head=40, tail=29, so span [29,40] since right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, (4,-7,right,4): head=4, tail=-7, so span [-7,4]\n\n(-32,-43,right,4): head=-32, tail=-43, span [-43,-32]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 5: (0,-11,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\n(0,-11,right,12): head=0, tail=-11, so span [-11,0]\n\n(48,37,right,12): head=48, tail=37, span [37,48]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8 same as 5? No, freeway 6,7,8 have same cars as 5? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 5: (0,-11,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (0,-11,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 all have two cars: one with span [-11,0] at t₁, and one with [37,48] at t₁, both speed 12.\n\nNow freeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3 have one car each: for k=1,2,3: (-36,-47,right,3), so span [-47,-36] at t₁.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at different turns.\n\nCollision occurs if for a freeway i, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nSo I need to find for each freeway, at which turns T, 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to see if any car covers 0 at time T.\n\nFirst, let's define ΔT = T - t₁ = T - 58.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nSo for each car, the times when 0 is covered.\n\nBut for a freeway, with multiple cars, I need the union.\n\nBut since cars may overlap, but I just need to know if 0 is covered at time T for that freeway.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: one car, τ = -47, h = -36, s=3\n\nSo span at T: [-47 + 3ΔT, -36 + 3ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 3ΔT\n\nSo -47 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 => 3ΔT ≤ 47 => ΔT ≤ 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so ΔT ≤ 15 since integer\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -36 + 3ΔT => 3ΔT ≥ 36 => ΔT ≥ 12\n\nSo for ΔT from 12 to 15 inclusive, 0 is covered on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, same as freeway 1? Freeway 2 also has (-36,-47,right,3), same as freeway 1.\n\nIn the table, freeway 1,2,3 all have the same car: (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nSo for each, same coverage: 0 covered when ΔT between 12 and 15 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 same.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4), so τ=-43, h=-32, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-43 + 4ΔT, -32 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -43 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 4ΔT\n\nSo -43 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 43 => ΔT ≤ 43/4 = 10.75, so ΔT ≤ 10\n\n0 ≤ -32 + 4ΔT => 4ΔT ≥ 32 => ΔT ≥ 8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (4,-7,right,4), so h=4, τ=-7, s=4\n\nSpan: [-7 + 4ΔT, 4 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -7 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 4 + 4ΔT\n\n-7 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 7 => ΔT ≤ 7/4 = 1.75, so ΔT ≤ 1\n\n0 ≤ 4 + 4ΔT always true for ΔT ≥0, but we have lower bound.\n\n-7 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 => ΔT ≤ 1.75, so ΔT ≤ 1\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 4 + 4ΔT is always true since 4+4ΔT ≥4>0.\n\nBut the inequality is τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT, so -7 +4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 4 +4ΔT\n\n0 ≤ 4+4ΔT is always true for ΔT ≥0.\n\n-7+4ΔT ≤ 0 is required, which is ΔT ≤ 1.75, so ΔT ≤1\n\nBut also, for 0 to be in, we need both, but since upper bound is always true, only when ΔT ≤1.\n\nΔT ≤1 means -7+4ΔT ≤0, and 0 ≤4+4ΔT always, so for ΔT=0,1, 0 is covered? Let's check.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=t₁=58, span is [-7,4], so 0 is between -7 and 4, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=59, span [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=2, span [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so not covered.\n\nSo only for ΔT=0 and 1.\n\nΔT=0: T=58, ΔT=1: T=59.\n\nNow third car on freeway 4: (40,29,right,4), head=40, tail=29, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [29 + 4ΔT, 40 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 29 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 40 + 4ΔT\n\nBut 29 + 4ΔT ≥ 29 >0 for ΔT≥0, so left part 29+4ΔT ≤0 is false, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 4, the dangerous times are from first car: ΔT=8,9,10 and from second car: ΔT=0,1\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 has collision at T when ΔT=0,1,8,9,10\n\nΔT=0: T=58, ΔT=1: T=59, ΔT=8: T=58+8=66, ΔT=9: T=67, ΔT=10: T=68\n\nNow freeways 5,6,7,8: each has two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12), so h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [-11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nNow 0 ≤ 12ΔT is always true for ΔT ≥0, since 12ΔT ≥0.\n\nAnd -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 11 => ΔT ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so only ΔT=0\n\nAt ΔT=0, -11 ≤0≤0, 0 is included, since span is [-11,0], so 0 is covered.\n\nAt ΔT=1, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=58.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), h=48, τ=37, s=12\n\nSpan: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT\n\n37 + 12ΔT ≥37>0, so never ≤0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSo for freeways 5,6,7,8, only the first car causes collision at ΔT=0, T=58.\n\nSpecifically, at T=58, for each of these freeways, there is a car with span including 0.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nI start at turn t₁=58, at y=3.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nI need to be on row y_T at turn T, and for that row, if it is between 1 and 8, it must not have 0 covered at that turn.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no car, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 at T=58 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from T=58.\n\nAt T=58, I am on y=3.\n\nI choose action a_{58}, which determines y_{59}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, with T >=58.\n\nMinimize the number of actions, so minimize the turns to reach.\n\nSince I start at y=3, need to go to y=9, minimum 6 steps up, so H=6 possible if no cars, but with cars, I need to avoid being on a row with collision at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list for each row and each turn around, when it is dangerous.\n\nFirst, for row y=1: dangerous when? From above, freeway 1 has collision at ΔT=12,13,14,15, so T=58+12=70, 71,72,73\n\nSimilarly for y=2: same as y=1, since freeway 2 same car, so dangerous at T=70,71,72,73\n\ny=3: freeway 3, same, dangerous at T=70,71,72,73\n\ny=4: freeway 4, dangerous at T=58,59,66,67,68\n\nT=58: ΔT=0, T=59:ΔT=1, T=66:ΔT=8, T=67:ΔT=9, T=68:ΔT=10\n\ny=5: freeway 5, dangerous only at T=58 (since only ΔT=0)\n\nSimilarly y=6: only at T=58\n\ny=7: only at T=58\n\ny=8: only at T=58\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nAt T=58, I am on y=3.\n\ny=3 at T=58: is it dangerous? For y=3, freeway 3, dangerous at T=70,71,72,73, not at T=58.\n\nAt T=58, freeway 3 has the car at [-47,-36], which is far left, 0 not covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, at T=58, it is dangerous, but I'm not on y=4 yet.\n\nNow, I need to move up to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times:\n\n- For rows 5,6,7,8: only dangerous at T=58. Since only at that time 0 is covered.\n\nAfter T=58, for T>58, rows 5-8 are safe, because the car that covered 0 at T=58 has moved away, and the other car is at [37,48] or something, not covering 0.\n\nFor example, row 5 at T=59: the car that was at [-11,0] is now at [-11+12,0+12]=[1,12] at T=59, so 0 not covered, and the other car at [37,48] never covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for rows 6,7,8.\n\nNow row 4: dangerous at T=58,59,66,67,68\n\nT=58 and 59 are past or current? T=58 is current turn, but I'm not on row 4 at T=58, I'm on row 3.\n\nT=59 is next turn.\n\nThen later T=66,67,68.\n\nRow 1,2,3: dangerous only at T=70,71,72,73, which is later.\n\nNow, I start at T=58, y=3, which is safe at T=58.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe quickest way: I can go up directly, but I need to check when I pass each row.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are only dangerous at T=58, and T=58 is now, I can be on them after T=58 safely.\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=4 at some turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nIf I go up from y=3 to y=4, that means at some turn, I move U, so at turn T, I am on y_T, I choose U, so y_{T+1} = y_T +1.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T, and I choose action which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nWhen I am on row y at turn T, I need that row y is not dangerous at time T.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be on rows 4,5,6,7,8 at some point, except that I start at 3.\n\nI start at 3, need to go to 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no need to be on it with car, but when I reach y=9, I am on it at that turn, but since no car, safe.\n\nNow, the critical part is row 4, which has multiple dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, row 4 is dangerous at T=58,59,66,67,68.\n\nT=58 and 59 are very soon.\n\nSince I start at T=58 on y=3, I can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf I move up to y=4 at turn T=58: I choose a_{58} = U, then y_{59} = 4.\n\nBut at turn T=58, I am on y=3, which is safe.\n\nAfter action, at T=59, I will be on y=4.\n\nAt T=59, y=4 is dangerous because row 4 at T=59 is dangerous (from above).\n\nIf I go to y=4 at T=59, I will be on row 4 at turn 59, and it is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I choose S at T=58, I stay at y=3 for T=59? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=58, I am on y=3.\n\nI choose action a_{58}:\n\n- If U, then y_{59} = 4\n\n- If D, then y_{59} = 2, but y=2 is row 2, which is safe except later at 70-73, but now T=59, safe.\n\n- If S, then y_{59} = 3\n\nNow, at turn T=59, I will be on y_{59}.\n\nIf I choose U at T=58, at T=59 I am on y=4, which is dangerous at T=59.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I choose S at T=58, at T=59 I am on y=3, which is safe at T=59 (since dangerous only at 70-73).\n\nThen at T=59, I can choose action for T=60.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose D, to y=2 at T=59, which is safe.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nNow, row 4 is also dangerous at later times 66,67,68.\n\nBut T=66 is many turns away.\n\nSince I need to minimize turns, I should go up as soon as possible, but avoid the dangerous times.\n\nAt T=58, I cannot go up to y=4 immediately because at T=59, y=4 is dangerous.\n\nI could go up later.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nI need to be on row 4 at a time when it is safe.\n\nRow 4 is safe except at T=58,59,66,67,68.\n\nSo safe times are for T not 58,59,66,67,68.\n\nT=58 is current, T=59 next.\n\nNow, since I start at T=58 on y=3, I can stay at y=3 for a while, then go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nRows 5-8 are safe after T=58, so I can pass through them quickly.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe only issue is row 4, because it has dangerous times soon and later.\n\nTo minimize H, I should not delay unnecessarily.\n\nAt T=58, I can choose to stay or go down, but going down to y=2 or lower might not help, and y=0 is safe.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nOption 1: I stay at y=3 for T=58 and T=59.\n\nAt T=58, I choose S, so at T=59, I am still on y=3.\n\nAt T=59, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen at T=59, I can choose to go up to y=4.\n\nIf I choose U at T=59, then at T=60, I am on y=4.\n\nNow, T=60, is row 4 dangerous? Dangerous at 58,59,66,67,68, so T=60 is safe.\n\nThen at T=60, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=5 at T=61, and so on.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nStart: T=58, y=3, choose S, so at T=59, y=3.\n\nT=59, y=3, choose U, so at T=60, y=4.\n\nT=60, y=4, choose U, so at T=61, y=5.\n\nT=61, y=5, choose U, so at T=62, y=6.\n\nT=62, y=6, choose U, so at T=63, y=7.\n\nT=63, y=7, choose U, so at T=64, y=8.\n\nT=64, y=8, choose U, so at T=65, y=9.\n\nI reach y=9 at T=65.\n\nNow, check if all positions are safe.\n\n- At T=58, y=3: safe, not dangerous time.\n\n- T=59, y=3: safe.\n\n- T=60, y=4: T=60 not dangerous for row 4 (dangerous at 58,59,66,etc), so safe.\n\n- T=61, y=5: row 5 dangerous only at T=58, now T=61>58, so safe.\n\n- T=62, y=6: similarly, safe after T=58.\n\n- T=63, y=7: safe.\n\n- T=64, y=8: safe.\n\n- T=65, y=9: safe, no car.\n\nSo I reach at T=65 with 7 actions: from T=58 to T=64, actions at t=58 to 64, so 7 turns? Let's count.\n\nActions at turns: T=58: S, T=59: U, T=60: U, T=61: U, T=62: U, T=63: U, T=64: U.\n\nAfter action at T=64, y_{65} = y_{64} +1 =8+1=9, so at T=65, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 7 actions, from t=58 to 64, H=7.\n\nBut is this minimal? Without cars, from y=3 to y=9, need 6 moves up, so H=6.\n\nCan I do it in 6 actions?\n\nThat means I need to reach y=9 at T=64, since start at T=58, after 6 actions, at T=64.\n\ny_{64} =9.\n\nAt T=58, y=3.\n\nAfter 6 actions, if all U, y=3+6=9 at T=64.\n\nBut with cars, I need to be safe at each position.\n\nIf I go all up:\n\nAction at T=58: U, then at T=59, y=4.\n\nBut at T=59, y=4 is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nCan I go up faster or slower?\n\nI could go to another row first.\n\nFor example, at T=58, instead of staying, I go down to y=2.\n\nAt T=58, choose D, then at T=59, y=2.\n\ny=2 at T=59: is it dangerous? Row 2 dangerous only at T=70-73, not at 59, so safe.\n\nThen at T=59, I can go up to y=3? y=3 at T=60.\n\nBut I need to go to y=4 eventually.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=59, I can go up to y=3 at T=60, then to y=4 at T=61.\n\nBut at T=61, y=4 is safe, as before.\n\nThen to y=5 at T=62, etc., up to y=9 at T=65, same as before, but I used one down action, so more actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=58: D, y=2 at T=59? At T=58, choose D, then y_{59} = y_{58} -1 =3-1=2.\n\nAt T=59, on y=2.\n\nThen T=59: choose U, y_{60} =3.\n\nAt T=60, on y=3.\n\nThen T=60: U, y_{61}=4.\n\nAt T=61, on y=4.\n\nT=61: U, y_{62}=5\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9 at T=65, with actions: T=58:D, T=59:U, T=60:U, T=61:U, ..., same as before but with an extra down and up, so y=9 at T=65 with 7 actions, worse than staying.\n\nSo not better.\n\nI could go directly to row 5 or something.\n\nBut to go to row 5, I need to pass row 4.\n\nUnless I stay on row 3 until it is safe to go to row 4.\n\nBut row 4 is safe from T=60 to T=65, since dangerous at 58,59,66,67,68.\n\nT=60 to 65 are safe for row 4.\n\nIn my first sequence, I went to row 4 at T=60.\n\nT=60 is safe.\n\nNow, to reach in 6 actions, I need to be at y=9 at T=64.\n\nThat means at T=64, y=9.\n\nSo the actions from T=58 to T=63 determine y_{64}.\n\ny_{64} = y_{58} + sum of Δy from t=58 to 63.\n\ny_{58} =3, need y_{64}=9, so sum Δy = +6.\n\nEach action U: +1, D: -1, S:0, so I need exactly 6 U actions, no S or D, because if I have S or D, I need more U, but with fixed number of actions.\n\nIn 6 actions, to gain +6, I must have all U, no S or D.\n\nSo the only way to reach in 6 actions is to go up every turn from T=58 to T=63.\n\nThen:\n\nAt T=58: U, y_{59} =4\n\nAt T=59: U, y_{60} =5\n\nAt T=60: U, y_{61} =6\n\nAt T=61: U, y_{62} =7\n\nAt T=62: U, y_{63} =8\n\nAt T=63: U, y_{64} =9\n\nNow, check positions:\n\nAt T=58: on y=3, safe.\n\nAt T=59: on y=4, but T=59, row 4 dangerous, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I start later, but I have to start at T=58.\n\nSo impossible to reach in 6 actions with all up.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7, as in my first sequence.\n\nBut in that sequence, I used one S at the beginning, then all U.\n\nI could go up immediately to a safe row.\n\nFor example, at T=58, I could go down to y=2, but as before, it takes more actions.\n\nOr, I could go to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but lower, so it takes more steps to go up.\n\nFor example, at T=58: D, to y=2 at T=59? y_{59}=2 if D.\n\nThen from there go up, but it will take more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor instance, from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, but with actions, I start at y=3 T=58, if I go to y=2 at T=59, then to y=3 at T=60, etc., it takes at least 7 actions to gain +6? From y=3, to y=9, need +6.\n\nIf I go down first, I go to y=2, which is -1, then I need +7 to reach 9, so more actions.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the first sequence with H=7 seems best.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have one S and six U, total 7 actions, reach at T=65.\n\nBut is there a way with 6 actions? I think not, because I must avoid being on y=4 at T=59.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nBut with 6 actions all up, I am on y=4 at T=59 inevitably.\n\nUnless I skip row 4 or something, but I can't, since I move one step at a time.\n\nI could go down to avoid, but that would require more actions to compensate.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=58 I go down to y=2, but then I need to go up more.\n\nWith 6 actions: if I do, say, D,U,U,U,U,U: y from 3 to 2, then to 3,4,5,6,7 at T=64? Let's see:\n\nT=58: D, y_{59}=2\n\nT=59: U, y_{60}=3\n\nT=60: U, y_{61}=4\n\nT=61: U, y_{62}=5\n\nT=62: U, y_{63}=6\n\nT=63: U, y_{64}=7\n\nOnly reach y=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need more up actions.\n\nFor example, with one D, I need seven U to net +6, but in 6 actions, impossible to have net +6 with a down.\n\nWith all up, I can reach, but collision.\n\nSo indeed, H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, in my sequence, I used S at T=58, but I could use another action.\n\nFor example, at T=58, I could go down to y=2, but then I reach later.\n\nOr, I could stay, as I did.\n\nBut staying is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, I have:\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nThen at T=65, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are from t=58 to t=64, so turns t=58 to t=64, which is 7 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nAt T=58: position y=3, choose S, so at T=59, y=3.\n\nThen at T=59: on y=3, choose U, so at T=60, y=4.\n\nAt T=60: on y=4, choose U, so at T=61, y=5.\n\nAt T=61: on y=5, choose U, so at T=62, y=6.\n\nAt T=62: on y=6, choose U, so at T=63, y=7.\n\nAt T=63: on y=7, choose U, so at T=64, y=8.\n\nAt T=64: on y=8, choose U, so at T=65, y=9.\n\nAll safe, as previously checked.\n\nI could have gone up at T=58 to y=4, but that would be at T=59 on y=4, which is dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nI could wait longer, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=3 until T=60, then go up.\n\nAt T=58: S, at T=59 y=3\n\nT=59: S, at T=60 y=3\n\nThen T=60: U, to y=4 at T=61\n\nThen T=61: U, to y=5 at T=62\n\n...\n\nUp to T=65: U, to y=8 at T=66? Let's see:\n\nAfter T=60: U, at T=61 y=4\n\nT=61: U, T=62 y=5\n\nT=62: U, T=63 y=6\n\nT=63: U, T=64 y=7\n\nT=64: U, T=65 y=8\n\nT=65: U, T=66 y=9\n\nReach at T=66 with 8 actions, worse.\n\nSo my first sequence with 7 actions is better.\n\nIn the sequence, I have row 4 at T=60, which is safe.\n\nBut row 4 is also dangerous at T=66,67,68, but in my sequence, I am on row 4 at T=60, which is before that, so fine.\n\nNow, but I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I used S at T=58, but is there a way without staying?\n\nFor example, at T=58, I go down to y=2, but then I need to come back, which takes more actions.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to a row that is safe.\n\nBut row 5 is safe after T=58, but to get to row 5, I need to be on row 4 at some point.\n\nUnless I could jump, but I move one step per turn.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if I can be on row 4 at T=65 or something, but that would be later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=3 until T=65, but T=65 is far, and I need to go up, it will take more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think 7 is the min.\n\nNow, in the car state, for row 4, at T=66,67,68 dangerous, but I am on it at T=60, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, other rows are safe.\n\nBut in row 5-8, only dangerous at T=58, which is past when I am on them.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on row 5 at T=61, which is after T=58, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure about the car movements.\n\nAnother thing: when I am on a row, and the car is moving, but as long as at that exact turn, 0 not in span, it should be fine.\n\nIn the collision rule, it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the span is computed at time T.\n\nIn my case, all safe.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by going to y=9 directly, but no, I have to go through the rows.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I could go down to y=0 and stay, but that would take more turns to go up, not efficient.\n\nFor example, from y=3 to y=0: down 3 times, then up to 9, 9 times, total 12 actions, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=58.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nThen at turn 65, position (0,9).\n\nNumber of turns H=7.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo t=0: a_{t1} = a_{58}\n\nt=1: a_{59}\n\n...\n\nup to t=H-1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nIn this case, t=0 to 6, actions at turn 58 to 64.\n\nAfter that, at turn t1 + H = 58 + 7 = 65, position y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the action, at turn 58: S, which is stay.\n\nBut in the output, it should be S for stay.\n\nNow, but let me double-check the dangerous times for row 4.\n\nRow 4 dangerous at T=58,59,66,67,68.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on row 4 at T=60, which is not in {58,59,66,67,68}, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows fine.\n\nBut at T=58, row 4 is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nAt T=59, row 4 dangerous, I am on row 3.\n\nAt T=66,67,68, I am on higher rows.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=66, I am on y=8 or something.\n\nT=66: from sequence, at T=64, I am on y=8? Let's see:\n\nAt T=64: on y=8, after action U, to y=9 at T=65.\n\nAt T=65: on y=9.\n\nT=66: I am not on any row with car, but since I reach at T=65, I don't care after.\n\nBut at T=66, if I were on row 4, it would be dangerous, but I'm not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later but with fewer stays.\n\nFor example, if I go up at T=58 to y=4, but cannot because of T=59 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 58: S Turn 59: U Turn 60: U Turn 61: U Turn 62: U Turn 63: U Turn 64: U }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nIn the format, it should be each turn on a new line, I think.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince it's text, I can write:\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have seven actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I go up faster after.\n\nBut I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: at T=58, I go up, but to avoid being on y=4 at T=59, I cannot.\n\nUnless I go to y=4 at a safe time immediately.\n\nBut the safe time for row 4 starts at T=60.\n\nAt T=58, I am on y=3, if I go up at T=58, I am on y=4 at T=59, dangerous.\n\nIf I stay at T=58, on y=3 at T=59, then at T=59 I can go up to y=4 at T=60, which is safe.\n\nNo way to be on y=4 earlier safely.\n\nThus, the sequence is correct.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 58\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Dangerous Times\nThe cars on each freeway move right with constant speed. The span of each car at turn \\(T\\) is computed relative to \\(t_1 = 58\\), with \\(\\Delta T = T - 58\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) on freeway \\(k\\) if the player is on row \\(k\\) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n- **Freeways 1, 2, and 3**: Each has one car with tail \\(-47\\), head \\(-36\\), speed 3.  \n  Dangerous when \\(\\Delta T = 12, 13, 14, 15\\) (turns 70 to 73).\n- **Freeway 4**: Three cars:\n  - \\((-43, -32, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Dangerous when \\(\\Delta T = 8, 9, 10\\) (turns 66 to 68).\n  - \\((-7, 4, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Dangerous when \\(\\Delta T = 0, 1\\) (turns 58, 59).\n  - \\((29, 40, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Never dangerous.  \n  Thus, freeway 4 is dangerous at turns 58, 59, 66, 67, 68.\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8**: Each has two cars:\n  - \\((-11, 0, \\text{right}, 12)\\): Dangerous only at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\) (turn 58).\n  - \\((37, 48, \\text{right}, 12)\\): Never dangerous.  \n  Thus, each of these freeways is dangerous only at turn 58.\n\nRows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimizing Turns\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 58. The minimum number of moves to reach \\(y = 9\\) without cars is 6 upward moves, but car collisions must be avoided:\n- At turn 58, \\(y = 3\\) is safe (not dangerous for freeway 3).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 59 (via action U at turn 58) would place the player on freeway 4 at turn 59, which is dangerous.\n- Staying at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 58 (action S) avoids this, and \\(y = 3\\) is safe at turn 59.\n- Then, moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 60 is safe, as turn 60 is not dangerous for freeway 4.\n- Rows 5 to 8 are safe after turn 58, so moving up through them is safe.\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 65 with 7 actions is possible and minimal, as 6 actions would require all upward moves, leading to collision on row 4 at turn 59.\n\n### Sequence of Actions (7 Turns)\n- **Turn 58 (current turn)**: Action S (stay), player remains at \\(y = 3\\). Safe, as row 3 not dangerous at turn 58 or 59.\n- **Turn 59**: Action U (up), player moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 60. At turn 59, player is on \\(y = 3\\), safe.\n- **Turn 60**: Action U, player moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 61. At turn 60, on \\(y = 4\\), safe (turn 60 not dangerous for row 4).\n- **Turn 61**: Action U, player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 62. At turn 61, on \\(y = 5\\), safe (row 5 safe after turn 58).\n- **Turn 62**: Action U, player moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 63. At turn 62, on \\(y = 6\\), safe.\n- **Turn 63**: Action U, player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 64. At turn 63, on \\(y = 7\\), safe.\n- **Turn 64**: Action U, player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 65.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t=64, and I need to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car on that row at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway y_T. And importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I don't get collided by cars on y+1 at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since the grid is from y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something? y=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the target. The problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so probably y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are safe. Confirming: \"freeways y=1,…,8\" so only those rows have cars. So y=0 and y=9 should be car-free, so no collision risk there.\n\nSo at y=0, start, no car. At y=9, target, no car. But to reach y=9, I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, the player movement: each turn, I can go up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0), and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive. Since I start at 0 and want to go to 9, I probably want to go up most of the time, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, the cars: each freeway has cars with positions given at turn t1=64.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at t=64.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 3. Since direction right, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t=64. And it's moving right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-64), -48 + 3(T-64)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"(-48, -59, right, 3)\" so head -48, tail -59, but direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48], same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: first (-48, -59, right, 4), so [ -59, -48] at t=64\n\nSecond: (-12, -23, right, 4), so [ -23, -12] at t=64\n\nThird: (24, 13, right, 4), head 24, tail 13? But direction right, so span should be [tail, head], so [13, 24]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h], so head and tail might be confusing.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h]? No.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves right, so at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4, it has (-48, -59, right, 4), so h = -48, τ = -59, d=right, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, (-12, -23, right, 4), h=-12, τ=-23, span [-23, -12]\n\n(-12, -23, right, 4), so τ = -23, h = -12, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nThen third: (24, 13, right, 4), h=24, τ=13, so span [13,24] at t=64.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), span [ -59, -48] at t=64\n\nAnd (0, -11, right, 12), span [ -11, 0] at t=64. τ=-11, h=0, so span [-11, 0].\n\nAt t=64, on freeway 5, there is a car with span [-11, 0], which includes 0. But since the player is at y=0 at t=64, and freeway 5 is y=5, I think. Freeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nAt t=64, player is at (0,0), which is not on any freeway, since freeways start from y=1. So no collision at t=64.\n\nNow, I need to move to higher y.\n\nThe critical part is that when I am on a freeway row at turn T, I need that for that row, 0 not in any car's span at T.\n\nAlso, since cars are moving, their positions change over time.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 with min turns, avoiding being on y=k when 0 is in a car span on row k at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and want to go to y=9, I need to move up through the rows.\n\nEach move U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nBut since I want to go up, probably mostly U, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements over time.\n\nSet ΔT = T - 64, so at time T = 64 + t, where t=0 is now.\n\nFor a car on a row, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf right-moving: [τ + s*t, h + s*t] where t = T - 64\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*t, τ - s*t] but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: right, 3\n\nFreeway 2: right, 3\n\nFreeway 3: right, 3\n\nFreeway 4: all right, 4\n\nFreeway 5: both right, 12\n\nFreeway 6: both right, 12\n\nFreeway 7: both right, 12\n\nFreeway 8: both right, 12\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving. That simplifies things.\n\nSo for any car, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-64), h + s*(T-64)]\n\nCollision on row k at time T if 0 is in [τ + s*(T-64), h + s*(T-64)] for some car on row k.\n\nSince the span is a closed interval, and 0 is a point.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when 0 is not covered by any car on that row.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the times when no car covers 0.\n\nBut for path planning, I need to coordinate the times I visit each row.\n\nSince the rows are independent in terms of car movement, but my position depends on my actions.\n\nI should find for each row, the set of times when it is safe, i.e., 0 not occupied.\n\nThen I need to move from y=0 to y=9, spending at least one turn on each intermediate row if I go through, but I can skip rows by moving multiple times, but since each action changes y by at most 1, to go from y to y+1, I need to be on y+1 at some point, but I might not stay on intermediate rows if I move fast.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nThe player position: I start at y=0 at t=64.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, then move to new y.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nThen I choose a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T, so I need that on row y_T, no car has 0 in span at time T.\n\nIf y_T is between 1 and 8, I need to avoid collision; if y_T=0 or 9, no car, so always safe.\n\nAt turn T, after I move, I am at y_{T+1}, but for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or when I am on the row during the turn.\n\nFrom the rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the row I am on at turn T.\n\nWhen I move at turn T, I am moving to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T.\n\nSo for each turn T, I am on y_T, and I need safety on that row at that time.\n\nThen at turn T, I choose action to go to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nI start at t=64, y=0.\n\nI need to reach a state where at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe to be there.\n\nBut to get there, I need to pass through the freeway rows.\n\nThe minimal H might be achieved by going up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the rows when cars are at 0.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up every turn: U,U,U,... from y=0 to y=9, that would take 9 moves, so from t=64 to t=72, y=9 at t=73? Let's see:\n\nAt t=64, y=0\n\nAfter action at t=64, y_{65} = y_{64} + Δy_{64}\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, then choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, I need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 up moves. Since I start at t=64, the earliest I can be at y=9 is if I do 9 U in a row, then at t=64, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{64}, at t=65, y=1 if U, or 0 if S, etc.\n\nIf I do U at t=64, t=65, ..., up to t=72, then:\n\nAfter a_{64} U, y_{65} =1\n\nAfter a_{65} U, y_{66}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{72} U, y_{73}=9\n\nSo at turn t=73, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from t=64 to t=73, that's 9 actions? Turns from t=64 to t=64+H-1, with y_{64+H-1}=9.\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t=64 to t=64+H-1, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=64 + H, position y_{64+H}.\n\nWe want y_{64+H-1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIndices: actions for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} = y after last action.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn before last action? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nWe want at some turn, y_T =9 for T.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn t1 + H should be y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -2}, we have y_{t1 + H -1}, then we do action a_{t1 + H -1} to get y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9.\n\nThen the action at t1 + H -1 could be anything, but since we are at 9, we might stop or do S.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach y=9 at that turn.\n\nSo for min H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWith all U, we can be at y=9 at turn t=73, as above, with H=9 actions from t=64 to t=72, y at t=73 is 9.\n\nt=64: y=0, after a64, y65=1 if U\n\nt=65: y=1, after a65, y66=2 if U\n\n...\n\nt=72: y=8, after a72 U, y73=9\n\nAt turn t=73, y=9.\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{64 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn 64 + H -1, we want y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 64 to 64 + H -1, actions, then at turn 64 + H -1, position should be 9.\n\nWith H=9, turn from 64 to 72, actions, then at turn 73? No.\n\nt1 + H -1 =64 + H -1\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1, we want y_T =9.\n\nH is number of actions, so after H actions, we have gone through turns t1 to t1+H-1, and position at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=0, no actions, at turn t1=64, y=0, not 9.\n\nWith H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, before the last action, we are at 9.\n\nThen the action at t1 + H -1 might be S or something, but since we are at 9, it could be S to stay, or U or D, but y must be in 0-9, so U from 9 would go to 10, but y=10 is invalid, so probably we don't go above 9. Similarly, down from 0.\n\nThe player update has y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, U is invalid, similarly y_t=0, D invalid.\n\nSo from y=9, only S or D, but D to 8, which is not target.\n\nTo reach y=9 and stay, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, and we can choose to stay or whatever, but for min H, once we reach, we stop the sequence.\n\nIn this case, to have y_T=9 at turn T, with T = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 73, with t1=64, 73 = 64 + H -1, so 9 = H -1, H=10? Let's solve.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 =9\n\n64 + H -1 =9? 63 + H =9, H=9-63? No.\n\nt1=64, T =64 + H -1\n\nSet T=64 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nWith all U: at t=64, y=0\n\na64 U, y65=1\n\na65 U, y66=2\n\n...\n\na72 U, y73=9\n\nSo at turn 73, y=9, which is T=73.\n\nSo 73 = 64 + H -1\n\n64 + H -1 =73, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=64 to t=73? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=64, actions at t=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72 for H=9 actions? List:\n\nAction at time: a64, a65, a66, a67, a68, a69, a70, a71, a72: that's 9 actions.\n\nThen y at t=65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73.\n\nAt t=73, y=9.\n\nBut we want y at turn t1 + H -1 =64 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nFor H=9, t1+H-1=64+8=72, but at t=72, with above, y=8, not 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 72, y=8, then after a72 U, y73=9.\n\nSo at turn 72, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y at turn T=72 be 9, I need to arrive earlier.\n\nFor example, if I start at t=64 y=0, and I do U at t=64, y65=1\n\nU at t=65, y66=2\n\n...\nU at t=71, y72=8? Let's see:\n\nt=64: after a64 U, y65=1\n\nt=65: after a65 U, y66=2\n\n...\nt=71: after a71 U, y72=8\n\nThen at t=72, y=8, if I do U, y73=9, but at turn 72, y=8 not 9.\n\nIf I do U at t=72, y73=9, but turn 72 position is 8.\n\nTo have y72=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 72.\n\nBut at turn 72, to have y72=9, I must have been at y=8 at turn 71 and done U, or at y=9 at turn 71 and done S, etc.\n\nEarliest: at t=64, y=0, after U, y65=1\n\nAfter U at t=65, y66=2\n\n...\nAfter U at t=71, y72=8\n\nThen to have y72=9, I need to do U at t=72, but that sets y73=9, not y72.\n\ny72 is set by action at t=71.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is fixed before action a_t.\n\nThen a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn T, y_T is position, then a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nTo have y_T=9 at some T.\n\nFor min T, with all U, y65=1, y66=2, ..., y72=8, y73=9. So T=73.\n\ny72=8.\n\nIf I start from y=0 at t=64, the earliest y=9 is at t=73 with all U.\n\nWith other actions, it might be later, so 73 is the earliest possible if no cars.\n\nBut with cars, it might be delayed.\n\nIn this case, with cars, I might not be able to go straight up due to collisions.\n\nBut let's first check if all U is possible or not.\n\nSo with all U, I go through each row from 1 to 8 at turns 65 to 72, and at each turn, I need to check if on that row, at that time, 0 is not occupied by a car.\n\nFor each row, at the time I am on it.\n\nWith all U, I am on row y at turn 64 + y, because at turn 65, y=1; turn 66, y=2; ... turn 72, y=8; then at turn 73, y=9.\n\nLet's list:\n\nAt turn T, y_T:\n\nT=64: y=0\n\nT=65: y=1 (after U at t=64)\n\nT=66: y=2\n\nT=67: y=3\n\nT=68: y=4\n\nT=69: y=5\n\nT=70: y=6\n\nT=71: y=7\n\nT=72: y=8\n\nT=73: y=9\n\nSo for rows 1 to 8, I am on them at turns 65 to 72 respectively.\n\nNow for each row, at that turn, I need that 0 is not in any car span on that row.\n\nLet's check for each row at the relevant time.\n\nFirst, row 1 (y=1) at T=65.\n\nCars on row 1: only one car, at t=64, span [-59,-48], right, speed 3.\n\nAt time T, span [τ + s(T-64), h + s(T-64)] = [-59 + 3(T-64), -48 + 3(T-64)]\n\nFor T=65, t=1, span [-59 +3(1), -48 +3(1)] = [-56, -45]\n\n0 not in [-56,-45], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 at T=66: cars same as row 1, span at T=66: t=2, [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nRow 3 at T=67: t=3, span [-59+9, -48+9] = [-50,-39], safe.\n\nNow row 4 at T=68.\n\nRow 4 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) so at t=64, span [-59,-48]\n\nAt T, [ -59 +4(T-64), -48 +4(T-64) ]\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) span at t=64: [-23,-12]\n\nAt T, [ -23 +4(T-64), -12 +4(T-64) ]\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) span at t=64: [13,24] since τ=13,h=24\n\nAt T, [13 +4(T-64), 24 +4(T-64)]\n\nAt T=68, t=4, so:\n\nFirst car: [-59 +4*4, -48 +4*4] = [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43,-32]\n\nSecond car: [-23 +16, -12+16] = [-7,4]\n\n[-7,4], which includes 0? -7 to 4, yes, 0 is between -7 and 4, so 0 is in [-7,4], so covered.\n\nThird car: [13+16, 24+16] = [29,40], not include 0.\n\nSo at T=68, on row 4, car 2 has span [-7,4], which includes 0, so collision if I am on row 4 at T=68.\n\nTherefore, with all U at T=68, I would be on row 4, and collision occurs.\n\nSo all U is not possible; I cannot be on row 4 at T=68.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid that.\n\nEither I be on row 4 at a different time, or skip row 4, but I have to pass through the rows; I can't skip because I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nI must go through each row between 0 and 9, but I can go up and down, so I might visit rows multiple times or skip some by moving fast, but since each move changes y by at most 1, to go from 0 to 9, I must at some point be on each y from 1 to 8, at least once, but not necessarily at a specific time; I might be on a row multiple times.\n\nFor example, I could go to y=1, then back to y=0, then up, etc., but that might increase time.\n\nThe minimal path would have me on each row from 0 to 9 exactly once if I go straight up, but I might need to delay or advance on some rows.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, I can adjust the timing.\n\nFor row 4, at what times is it safe?\n\nI need to find for row 4, the times T when 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nCars on row 4:\n\nCar1: span at T: [ -59 +4(T-64), -48 +4(T-64) ]\n\nCar2: [ -23 +4(T-64), -12 +4(T-64) ]\n\nCar3: [13 +4(T-64), 24 +4(T-64)]\n\n0 is covered if in any interval.\n\nFind when 0 in car1: solve -59 +4t <= 0 <= -48 +4t where t=T-64\n\n-59 +4t <= 0 => 4t <=59 => t<=14.75\n\n0 <= -48 +4t => 4t >=48 => t>=12\n\nSo for t in [12,14.75], 0 in car1? Let's see:\n\n-59+4t <=0 and 0<= -48+4t\n\nFrom 0 <= -48+4t => t >=12\n\n-59+4t <=0 => 4t <=59, t<=14.75\n\nAnd since it's inclusive, for t=12,13,14,15? t real, but T integer, so t integer.\n\nt=T-64 integer.\n\nFor t=12: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=15: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly, car2: [ -23+4t, -12+4t]\n\n0 in if -23+4t <=0 <= -12+4t\n\n-23+4t <=0 => 4t<=23 => t<=5.75\n\n0<= -12+4t => 4t>=12 => t>=3\n\nSo t=3,4,5\n\nt=3: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=4: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [13+4t, 24+4t], min 13+4t >=13>0 for t>=0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo row 4 unsafe when car1 covers 0 or car2 covers 0.\n\nCar1 covers 0 for t=12,13,14\n\nCar2 covers 0 for t=3,4,5\n\nSo row 4 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nSafe when t<3 or 6<=t<=11 or t>=15, etc.\n\nt=T-64.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut I need to go through all rows.\n\nFirst, row 5 at T=69 with all U.\n\nRow 5 has two cars.\n\nFirst: (-48,-59,right,12) span at t=64: [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [ -59 +12(T-64), -48 +12(T-64) ]\n\nSecond: (0,-11,right,12) span at t=64: [-11,0] since τ=-11,h=0\n\nAt T: [ -11 +12(T-64), 0 +12(T-64) ] = [ -11 +12t, 12t ] where t=T-64\n\nNow at T=69, t=5.\n\nFirst car: [-59 +12*5, -48 +12*5] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [-11 +12*5, 0 + 12*5] = [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], 0 not in, since 49>0? [49,60] all positive.\n\nAt t=5, second car: [ -11 +60, 60] = [49,60], yes.\n\nBut at t=64, second car is at [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nNow for row 5 at T=69, t=5, safe as above.\n\nBut let's find when row 5 is unsafe.\n\nCar1: [ -59 +12t, -48 +12t]\n\n0 in if -59+12t <=0 <= -48+12t\n\n-59+12t <=0 => 12t<=59 => t<=4.916\n\n0<= -48+12t => 12t>=48 => t>=4\n\nSo t=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=5: [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [ -11 +12t, 12t ]\n\n0 in if -11+12t <=0 <= 12t\n\nSince 12t >=0 always for t>=0, and -11+12t <=0 => 12t<=11 => t<=0.916, so only for t=0 or t=1? t integer.\n\nt=0: [ -11, 0], 0 in\n\nt=1: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo car2 covers 0 only at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, T=64.\n\nBut at T=64, player is at y=0, not on row 5.\n\nSo for row 5, unsafe when car1 covers 0 at t=4 (T=68) or car2 at t=0, but t=0 not relevant since we start later.\n\nt=4: T=68, car1 covers 0.\n\nt=0: T=64, car2 covers 0, but not on row at that time probably.\n\nSo row 5 unsafe at T=68 (t=4) when car1 covers 0.\n\nAlso, car2 covers 0 only at T=64.\n\nNow row 6: similar to row 5, cars same: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSo same as row 5.\n\nUnsafe at T=68 when car1 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly row 7 same, unsafe at T=68.\n\nRow 8 same, unsafe at T=68.\n\nRow 8 also has two cars like row 5.\n\nIn the table, freeway 5,6,7,8 all have same cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSo for each, unsafe when car1 covers 0 at t=4 (T=68), or car2 at t=0 (T=64).\n\nNow back to all U path.\n\nAt T=68, with all U, I am on row 4, but row 4 is unsafe at T=68, as we saw earlier, t=4 for T=68, but for row 4 at T=68, t=4.\n\nEarlier for row 4, at t=4, which car? For row 4, at t=4, car2 covers 0? t=4 for row 4.\n\nT=68, t=T-64=4.\n\nFor row 4, at t=4, car2: [ -23 +4*4, -12 +4*4] = [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nYes.\n\nMoreover, for rows 5,6,7,8, at T=69,70,71,72 respectively with all U.\n\nAt T=69, row 5: t=5, as above, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 6 at T=70, t=6, car1: [ -59+12*6, -48+12*6] = [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24], 0 not in; car2: [-11+72,72] = [61,72], not. Safe.\n\nSimilarly row 7 at T=71, t=7, car1: [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36]; car2: [-11+84,84] = [73,84], safe.\n\nRow 8 at T=72, t=8, car1: [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48]; car2: [-11+96,96] = [85,96], safe.\n\nBut row 4 at T=68 is problem.\n\nAlso, at T=68, for rows 5-8, they are unsafe only at T=68, but with all U, at T=68 I am on row 4, not on row 5-8, so no issue.\n\nOnly row 4 at T=68 is unsafe.\n\nI need to be on row 4 at a different time when it is safe.\n\nFor row 4, safe times: unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nt=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nSafe for t<3 or 6<=t<=11 or t>=15.\n\nt=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,...\n\nNow with all U, I am on row 4 at T=68, t=4, unsafe.\n\nI could delay being on row 4 or advance, but advancing might not be possible since I start from below.\n\nI am on row 1 at T=65, t=1; row2 at T=66,t=2; row3 at T=67,t=3; row4 at T=68,t=4.\n\nAt T=67, t=3, I am on row3.\n\nIf at T=67, instead of U to row4, I do S, stay on row3, then at T=68, still on row3, then later go to row4.\n\nBut row3 at T=67: let's check if safe.\n\nRow3 has cars: same as row1, (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nAt T=67, t=3, span [-59+9, -48+9] = [-50,-39], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt T=67, y=3, safe.\n\nIf I do S at T=67, then y_{68} = y_{67} =3, so at T=68, I am still on row3.\n\nThen at T=68, I can choose to go U to row4 or stay, etc.\n\nBut I need to go to row4 at a safe time.\n\nSafe times for row4: for example, at t=6, T=70.\n\nt=6, T=70.\n\nAt t=6, row4: car1: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], not 0\n\nCar2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nNow, with all U, at T=68 I am on row4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay on row3 at T=67 (by doing S instead of U), then at T=68, I am on row3.\n\nThen I need to go to row4 later.\n\nFor example, at T=68, I am on row3, I can go U to row4 at T=69? After action.\n\nAt turn T=68, position y=3 (if I stayed), then action a68, if U, then y69=4.\n\nSo at turn T=69, I am on row4.\n\nT=69, t=5.\n\nNow, at t=5, row4: car2 covers 0? Earlier: car2 at t=5: [ -23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], includes 0, so unsafe.\n\nt=5 is unsafe for row4.\n\nSimilarly, t=6 safe, T=70.\n\nSo I need to be on row4 at T=70, for example.\n\nBut at T=68, I am on row3.\n\nIf I do S at T=68, stay on row3, then at T=69, still on row3.\n\nThen at T=69, if I do U, y70=4, so at T=70, on row4.\n\nT=70, t=6, safe for row4.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut I need to see the timing for other rows.\n\nCurrently with all U, rows 5-8 at T=69-72.\n\nIf I delay row4 to T=70, then row5 would be later, etc.\n\nLet's outline the sequence.\n\nStart: t=64, y=0\n\na64 U: y65=1\n\nt=65, y=1, safe as before.\n\na65 U: y66=2\n\nt=66, y=2, safe\n\na66 U: y67=3\n\nt=67, y=3, safe\n\nNow instead of U, I do S at t=67: a67 S, so y68=3 (stay)\n\nt=68, y=3, which is row3, need to check if safe at T=68.\n\nRow3 at T=68: t=4, span for row3 car: [-59 +3*4, -48 +3*4] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=68, y=3, I can do S again or U.\n\nIf I do U at t=68, y69=4, then t=69, y=4, but t=5, unsafe as above.\n\nSo I should do S at t=68 to stay on row3.\n\na68 S, y69=3\n\nt=69, y=3\n\nThen at t=69, I do U, y70=4\n\nt=70, y=4, which is row4 at T=70, t=6, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to row5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut with delay, at t=70, y=4, whereas in all U, at t=70 I was on row6.\n\nNow I need to go up from y=4 to y=9.\n\nSo actions: at t=70, y=4, I can do U to y=5 at t=71? After a70 U, y71=5, so at turn t=71, y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I need to check if row5 is safe at that time.\n\nFirst, let's list the turns and positions.\n\nWe have:\n\nt=64: y=0\n\na64 U: y65=1\n\nt=65: y=1\n\na65 U: y66=2\n\nt=66: y=2\n\na66 U: y67=3\n\nt=67: y=3\n\na67 S: y68=3  (stay)\n\nt=68: y=3\n\na68 S: y69=3  (stay again)\n\nt=69: y=3\n\na69 U: y70=4\n\nt=70: y=4  (row4, safe at t=6)\n\nNow from here, I need to go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt t=70, y=4, I do U: a70 U, y71=5\n\nt=71: y=5, row5\n\nNow, row5 at T=71, t=7\n\nt=T-64=71-64=7\n\nRow5 cars:\n\nCar1: [-59 +12*7, -48+12*7] = [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [-11+12*7, 12*7] = [-11+84, 84] = [73,84], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a71 U: y72=6\n\nt=72: y=6, row6\n\nAt T=72, t=8\n\nRow6 same as row5, car1: [-59+96, -48+96]=[37,48], car2: [-11+96,96]=[85,96], safe.\n\na72 U: y73=7\n\nt=73: y=7, row7\n\nT=73, t=9\n\nCar1: [-59+108, -48+108]=[49,60], car2: [-11+108,108]=[97,108], safe.\n\na73 U: y74=8\n\nt=74: y=8, row8\n\nT=74, t=10\n\nCar1: [-59+120, -48+120]=[61,72], car2: [-11+120,120]=[109,120], safe.\n\na74 U: y75=9\n\nt=75: y=9, reached.\n\nBut at turn t=75, y=9.\n\nNow, how many actions? From t=64 to t=74, actions a64 to a74, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11, since actions from t1 to t1+H-1, t1=64, to 64+H-1=74, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut earlier with all U I could reach at t=73 with H=10, but not possible due to row4.\n\nIn this sequence, I reached at t=75.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nAt t=69, y=3, I did U to y=4 at t=70.\n\nBut at t=69, y=3, I could go directly to y=4 if possible, but t=69 is T=69, if I go to row4 at T=69, t=5, unsafe.\n\nI have to be on row4 at safe time.\n\nNext safe time after t=5 is t=6, T=70.\n\nI could be on row4 earlier, but before t=3? t=2, T=66.\n\nAt T=66, with all U, I was on row2, not row4.\n\nTo be on row4 at T=66, I need to have moved faster, but from y=0 at t=64, to y=4 at t=66? That would require multiple U in one turn? No, each action one move.\n\nAt t=64, y=0, after U, y65=1\n\nAt t=65, y=1, after U, y66=2\n\nAt t=66, y=2, after U, y67=3\n\nCannot be at y=4 before t=67 at earliest.\n\nAt t=67, y=3, after U, y68=4, but at T=68, y=4, t=4, unsafe.\n\nAt t=67, if I do U, y68=4, T=68 unsafe.\n\nBut at t=67, I could do nothing, stay, then go later.\n\nBut T=66 is too early, I can't be on row4 then.\n\nEarliest possible on row4 is T=67 if I go up fast, but at T=67, with y=3, if I do U, y68=4, T=68.\n\nAt T=67, I can be at y=3 max.\n\nSo cannot be on row4 before T=68.\n\nT=68 is unsafe, T=69 unsafe, T=70 safe.\n\nSo I must be on row4 at T=70 or later for safety.\n\nSimilarly, the safe times are T=70,71,... except when unsafe, but for row4, safe from t=6 onwards except t=12,13,14.\n\nBut t=12 is later, T=76, etc.\n\nSo earliest safe for row4 is T=70.\n\nIn the sequence above, I am on row4 at T=70.\n\nThen from there, I go up to row5 at T=71, etc., to row8 at T=74, then to row9 at T=75.\n\nBut row9 is safe.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, after being on row4 at T=70, I go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut rows 5-8 need to be safe at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=71, row5: t=7, safe as before.\n\nT=72, row6: t=8, safe.\n\nT=73, row7: t=9, safe.\n\nT=74, row8: t=10, safe.\n\nT=75, row9.\n\nIs there a way to be on row5 earlier? But I have to come from row4.\n\nSince I delayed row4, the upper rows are later.\n\nBut in this case, rows 5-8 are safe at earlier times, but I can't access them because I'm stuck below.\n\nFor example, row5 is safe at T=69, t=5? Row5 at T=69: t=5.\n\nCar1: at t=5, [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in? Earlier I said car1 at t=5: [1,12], yes.\n\nCar2: [ -11+60, 60] = [49,60], no.\n\nBut car2 at t=0 covered, but t=5 not.\n\nAt T=69, t=5, row5 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=68, row5 would be unsafe, but I'm not on it.\n\nBut to be on row5 at T=69, I need to be on row4 at T=68 or something.\n\nAt turn T, on row y.\n\nTo be at y=5 at turn T, I must have been at y=4 or y=5 or y=6 at turn T-1, and moved accordingly.\n\nBut to arrive at y=5, at turn T-1, if I was at y=4 and did U, or at y=5 and did S, or at y=6 and did D.\n\nBut since I want to go up, probably from below.\n\nSo to be at y=5 at T, I could have been at y=4 at T-1 and did U, or at y=5 at T-1 and did S, etc.\n\nIn particular, the earliest I can be at y=5 is at T=69: from y=4 at T=68 with U.\n\nBut at T=68, if I were on row4, it is unsafe, so I cannot be there.\n\nIf I were on row5 at T=68 with S, but I can't be on row5 at T=68 without passing through.\n\nAt T=67, I can be at y=3, then to y=4 at T=68, but row4 unsafe.\n\nIf I go directly, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot be on row5 before T=69? At T=69, to be at y=5, I need at T=68 to be at y=4 and U, or y=5 and S, but y=5 at T=68 requires earlier.\n\nEarliest: start at t=64 y=0\n\nt=65 y=1\n\nt=66 y=2\n\nt=67 y=3\n\nt=68 y=4 (if U from y=3)\n\nBut y=4 at t=68 unsafe.\n\nThen at t=68, if I do S, y69=4, then at t=69 y=4\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=70\n\nSo y=5 at t=70.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be earlier than t=70 for row5 if I avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut row5 is safe at t=69, T=69.\n\nTo be at row5 at T=69, I need to be on row4 at T=68 with U, but row4 unsafe at T=68, so I cannot do that.\n\nIf I were on row5 at T=68 with S, but to be on row5 at T=68, I need to have been there earlier, which I can't since I start from below.\n\nSo impossible to be on row5 at T=69 or earlier without being on row4 at unsafe time.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be on row5 is T=70: from row4 at T=69 with U, but row4 at T=69 is unsafe.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I am on row4 at T=70, then row5 at T=71.\n\nTo be on row5 at T=70, I need at T=69 to be on row4 and do U.\n\nBut if at T=69 I am on row4, which requires being there at T=69, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=69 I am on row4, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on row5 before T=71? Let's see.\n\nAt T=69, I can be on row3, as in my sequence.\n\nThen at T=69, on row3, I do U to y=4 at T=70.\n\nThen at T=70, on row4.\n\nThen at T=70, I can do U to y=5 at T=71.\n\nSo y=5 at T=71.\n\nIf I want y=5 at T=70, I need at T=69 to be on y=4 and do U.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at T=69, I need at T=68 to be on y=3 or y=4 or y=5.\n\nIf at T=68 on y=3 and U, then y=4 at T=69.\n\nBut row4 at T=69, t=5, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=68 on y=4 and S, but to be on y=4 at T=68, unsafe.\n\nNo way to be on row5 at T=70.\n\nThus, earliest for row5 is T=71 in this setup.\n\nSimilarly, for row6 at T=72, etc.\n\nIn my sequence, I have row5 at T=71, row6 at T=72, row7 at T=73, row8 at T=74, row9 at T=75.\n\nNow, but I have rows 1,2,3 at T=65,66,67, which were safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I stayed on row3 at T=68 and T=69.\n\nIs there a way to save time?\n\nFor example, after reaching row4 at T=70, I could move faster, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go to a higher row directly, but no.\n\nOr skip some rows by moving when possible, but I have to go through each.\n\nBut in this case, rows 1,2,3 are fine, only row4 is problematic.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row4 at a safe time and then proceed.\n\nBut I think the sequence I have is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on row5 at T=68.\n\nEarlier I thought row5 unsafe at T=68.\n\nFor row5, at T=68, t=4.\n\nCar1: [ -59 +12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], which includes 0, so yes, unsafe at T=68.\n\nSimilarly for rows 6,7,8 at T=68.\n\nBut in the path, I am not on them at that time.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn my sequence, I have:\n\nActions:\n\nt=64: U to y=1\n\nt=65: U to y=2\n\nt=66: U to y=3\n\nt=67: S (stay y=3)\n\nt=68: S (stay y=3)\n\nt=69: U to y=4\n\nt=70: U to y=5\n\nt=71: U to y=6\n\nt=72: U to y=7\n\nt=73: U to y=8\n\nt=74: U to y=9\n\nAt t=74, after U, y75=9, so at turn t=75, y=9.\n\nNow, the turn when y=9 is t=75.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 =75\n\nt1=64, so 64 + H -1 =75, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from t=64 to t=75? Let's list the action times.\n\nActions at: t=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74\n\nThat's 11 actions? t=64 to t=74 inclusive is 11 actions.\n\nt=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74: 11 actions.\n\nThen after last action at t=74, y75=9.\n\nAt turn t=75, y=9.\n\nNow, t=75 = t1 + H -1? t1=64, H=11, t1 + H -1 =64+11-1=74, but at turn 74, in sequence, y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t=74, position y=8.\n\nThen after action a74 U, y75=9.\n\nSo at turn t=74, y=8.\n\nAt turn t=75, y=9.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t1 + H -1 =75, so 64 + H -1 =75, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions at t=64 to t=64+11=75? t1 to t1+H-1=64 to 64+12-1=75.\n\nActions at t=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75? But at t=75, if I do action, but I already reached at turn t=75.\n\nIn the sequence, after 11 actions, I reach at turn 75.\n\nBut to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, with H=12, t1+H-1=64+11=75, y75=9.\n\nThen I need to specify actions from t=64 to t=75, but at t=75, I am already at y=9, so I can do S or something.\n\nIn min H, I can stop when I reach.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I need to include until the turn before I reach? No.\n\nLet's read the answer format.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, with all U and no cars, actions a64 to a72 (9 actions), y73=9, so t1+H-1=73, 64+H-1=73, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nIn my case, I reach at t=75, so t1+H-1=75, 64+H-1=75, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions at t=64 to t=75? t1 to t1+H-1=64 to 75.\n\nBut at t=75, I need an action, but y is already 9 at turn t=75 before action? No.\n\nAt turn t=75, position y75=9, then I choose action a75, which determines y76.\n\nBut since I want to reach at turn t=75, I can choose a75=S to stay, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions up to a74 to get to y75=9.\n\nBut for the sequence to include until a_{t1+H-1}, with y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo in this case, with H=12, actions from a64 to a75, and y75=9.\n\nAt t=75, I need to be at y=9, so I must have been at y=9 at turn t=75 before any action, meaning that a74 must have brought me to y=9 if I was at y=8.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=74, y=8, a74 U, y75=9.\n\nThen at turn t=75, y=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, I need to specify a75, but since I am at 9, I can do S.\n\nSimilarly, in the answer, I need to output until the action that makes me reach, but with the position at that turn.\n\nSo for min H, in my sequence, I can set H=12, actions a64 to a75.\n\na64 to a74 as above, and a75=S.\n\nBut let's list all.\n\nFirst, the actions to get there:\n\nFrom above: a64: U\n\na65: U\n\na66: U\n\na67: S (stay at y=3)\n\na68: S (stay at y=3)\n\na69: U (to y=4)\n\na70: U (to y=5)\n\na71: U (to y=6)\n\na72: U (to y=7)\n\na73: U (to y=8)\n\na74: U (to y=9)\n\nNow at turn t=75, y=9.\n\nThen I need a75, which can be S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to include a75 to have y_{t1+H-1}=y75=9.\n\nWith actions up to a74, I have y75=9, but the position at turn t1+H-1 is after the actions.\n\nIn the definition, the sequence of actions determines the positions.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, the position at turn t1+H is set, but we care about position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with actions from t=64 to t=74 (11 actions), after a74, y75=9, so at turn t=75, y=9.\n\nThen for y_{t1+H-1} = y75=9, we have t1+H-1=75, so 64 + H -1 =75, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen the actions must include a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a64 to a75.\n\nAt t=75, since y=9, I can set a75=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nBut to save an action, since at t=74 I go to y=9, and at t=75 I am at y=9, I could have a75 as part of the sequence, but it doesn't change the position for reaching.\n\nBut min H is 12 in this case.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: instead of staying on row3, I could go up to row4 at a safe time, but I have to wait.\n\nOr, I could go to row5 directly from row3? No, can't, only adjacent moves.\n\nPerhaps for the upper rows, since they are safe earlier, but I can't access.\n\nAnother thought: I could go down to row0 or something to kill time, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=0, I could stay or go down, but y=0, can't go down, only S or U.\n\nBut staying might not help.\n\nSuppose at some point I go down to lower row to wait, but since I need to go up, it might not save time.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=67, y=3, instead of staying, I go down to y=2 or something.\n\nBut row2 at T=67: with all U, I was on row2 at T=66, but if I go back.\n\nBut let's not complicate; I think the sequence I have is reasonable.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two S at row3, so I wasted two turns.\n\nBut I need to because row4 unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nt=4 and t=5 unsafe, so I have to wait until t=6.\n\nFrom t=67 (y=3) to t=69 (y=3), that's two turns waiting, then to y=4 at t=70.\n\nt=67 to t=69 is three turns at y=3? Let's see turns:\n\nAt T=67: y=3\n\nAfter a67 S, y68=3, T=68 y=3\n\nAfter a68 S, y69=3, T=69 y=3\n\nThen a69 U, y70=4, T=70 y=4\n\nSo from T=67 to T=69, I am at y=3 for three turns: T=67,68,69.\n\nThen T=70 y=4.\n\nI only need to be on row4 once, but I stayed extra on row3.\n\nI could have moved to row4 at T=70 directly from T=69, but I was at y=3.\n\nTo reduce waiting, but since row4 safe only from T=70, I have to be on some row until then.\n\nI could be on row2 or row1, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nFor example, at T=67, y=3, I could go down to y=2 at T=68, but then I need to come back, which might take more turns.\n\nFor instance:\n\nt=64: U, y65=1\n\nt=65: U, y66=2\n\nt=66: U, y67=3\n\nNow at t=67, instead of S, I do D, y68=2\n\nThen at T=68, y=2\n\nThen I need to go back up, but row2 at T=68: t=4, row2 car: similar to row1, at t=4, [-59+12, -48+12]? Row2 car speed 3, same as row1.\n\nAt T=68, t=4, span [-59+12, -48+12]? t=4, s=3, [-59+3*4, -48+3*4] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], safe.\n\nThen at T=68, y=2, I can do U to y=3 at T=69? After a68 U, y69=3\n\nT=69 y=3\n\nThen at T=69, y=3, I can do U to y=4 at T=70\n\nThen same as before, on row4 at T=70.\n\nBut I used an extra move: down then up, so I have more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nThus, my initial sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 12 actions to reach at t=75.\n\nBut let's confirm H.\n\nActions: from t=64 to t=75, 12 actions? t=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75.\n\nBut in my movement, actions a64 to a74 are to get to y=9 at t=75, then a75 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence up to a74, I reach y=9 at t=75 with 11 actions, but y_{t1+H-1} with H=11 would be y_{64+11-1}=y74=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1}=9, with t1=64, set T=64+H-1=75, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions at t=64 to t=75.\n\nWith a64 to a74 as above, and a75=S.\n\nNow, for the upper rows, in my sequence, I go to row5 at T=71, etc., but rows 5-8 are safe at earlier times, but since I am delayed, I go later.\n\nBut at T=71, row5 is safe, as before.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in freeway 5, at T=68 it is unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 4 has car at t=12,13,14 unsafe, but T=76,77,78, which is later, I am not there.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after row4.\n\nBut I think not.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach at t=74.\n\nSuppose I am on row4 at T=70, then if I could be on row5 at T=71, row6 at T=72, row7 at T=73, row8 at T=74, then to row9 at T=75, same as before.\n\nTo be on row8 at T=74, y=8 at turn 74.\n\nThen to have y=9 at T=75, I need to do U at T=74.\n\nBut T=75 is later.\n\nIf I want y=9 at T=74, I need to be at y=8 at T=73 and U, so y=9 at T=74.\n\nBut in my sequence, at T=73 I am on row7, y=7, after U to y=8 at T=74.\n\nNot at y=8.\n\nEarliest y=8: with all U no delay, at T=72, but with delay, later.\n\nIn this case, not possible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nFrom t=64 to t=75.\n\nBut t is turn.\n\nIn the answer, list actions starting from t1=64.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: S\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U  (to y=9 at next turn)\n\nNow at turn 75, y=9, so action at turn 75: S (stay)\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 75, a75=S.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 75, and we need to include it.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, H=12.\n\nActions:\n\nFor turn t=64: a_{64} = U\n\nTurn t=65: a_{65} = U\n\nTurn t=66: a_{66} = U\n\nTurn t=67: a_{67} = S\n\nTurn t=68: a_{68} = S\n\nTurn t=69: a_{69} = U\n\nTurn t=70: a_{70} = U\n\nTurn t=71: a_{71} = U\n\nTurn t=72: a_{72} = U\n\nTurn t=73: a_{73} = U\n\nTurn t=74: a_{74} = U\n\nTurn t=75: a_{75} = S\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 74, a74=U, from y=8 to y=9, so at turn 75, y=9.\n\nThen a75=S to stay, but it's not necessary for reaching, but to have the position at turn 75, and the action is specified.\n\nIn min H, I could have H=11 with y74=9? But y74=9 requires being at y=9 at turn 74.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 74, I need to have been at y=8 at turn 73 and U, or y=9 at turn 73 and S, etc.\n\nBut at turn 73, in sequence, y=7, not 8.\n\nIf I could be on row8 at T=73, but row8 at T=73: t=9, safe, as before.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=73, I need to come from below.\n\nSuppose I am on row4 at T=70, then U to row5 at T=71, U to row6 at T=72, U to row7 at T=73? After a72 U, y73=7, T=73 y=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=74.\n\nCannot be at y=8 at T=73.\n\nEarliest y=8: if no delay, at T=72, but with delay at row4, I am at row4 at T=70, then row5 T=71, row6 T=72, row7 T=73, row8 T=74, row9 T=75.\n\nSo y=9 at T=75 is earliest possible.\n\nThus H=12.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 4 has three cars, but I think I handled.\n\nOne thing: in freeway 5,6,7,8, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12) at t=64, which is at [-11,0], so at T=64, it covers 0, but since player not on row at that time, ok.\n\nBut in the path, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow to write in box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 64\\) is 12, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe car positions and movements are analyzed to determine safe times to be on each freeway row. Specifically, freeway 4 is unsafe at turns corresponding to \\(T - 64 = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\) (i.e., turns 67, 68, 69, 76, 77, 78) due to cars covering position \\(x=0\\). The earliest safe time to be on freeway 4 is at turn 70 (\\(t = 6\\)).\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must delay reaching freeway 4 until turn 70, which requires staying on row 3 (freeway 3) for turns 67, 68, and 69. After reaching row 4 safely at turn 70, the player can move upward without delay, as rows 5 to 8 are safe at the corresponding times.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 64, move up to row 1.\n- At turn 65, move up to row 2.\n- At turn 66, move up to row 3.\n- At turn 67, stay on row 3 to avoid unsafe time on row 4.\n- At turn 68, stay on row 3 to continue avoiding row 4.\n- At turn 69, move up to row 4 (now safe at turn 70).\n- At turn 70, move up to row 5.\n- At turn 71, move up to row 6.\n- At turn 72, move up to row 7.\n- At turn 73, move up to row 8.\n- At turn 74, move up to row 9.\n- At turn 75, stay on row 9 (target reached, no further action needed, but S is used to remain).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 75 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 64 + 12 - 1 = 75\\)) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 68, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of the car at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T). Then at the next turn, we will be on the new freeway.\n\nWe have to avoid being at a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn when a car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at y=3 (freeway 3 is at row 3? Note: freeways are from 1 to 8, and the player can be at y=0 to 9. The goal is y=9.\n\nThe freeways that matter are only when the player is at y=k (for k in 1..8). When the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1..8).\n\nWe are currently at y=3. We need to get to y=9. The minimal vertical distance is 6. However, we cannot move up arbitrarily because we must avoid the cars.\n\nActions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). And we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (turn 68) until we reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=3 and need to get to y=9, we must move up at least 6 times. However, we may have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid cars.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway and for each car, the positions of the car at future turns (relative to turn t1=68). Then, for each turn T (>=68) and for each freeway k, we know if there is a car at position 0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: we only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's movement and check for collisions.\n\nThe plan:\n- We want the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1 (because we start at t1 and the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1 will lead to the position at turn t1+H-1 being (0,9)).\n\nWe can do a BFS (breadth-first search) in the state space: (turn_offset, y) where turn_offset = t - t1 (so from 0 up) and y in [0,9]. But note that the car positions change with time, so we must compute the car positions at absolute turns (t = t1 + turn_offset).\n\nHowever, the state space in terms of time might be large, but note that we are only moving 6 steps up at minimum, and we might have to wait a few turns. Also, the car movements are linear and periodic? But the speeds are constant and the cars are long, so we can compute the time intervals when a freeway is blocked at x=0.\n\nBut note: each freeway k has multiple cars. We need to know for each freeway k and each absolute turn T, whether there is at least one car on freeway k that has 0 in its span.\n\nLet's precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (from t1 onwards, until we have a solution) the blockage at x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously in the sense that at each turn, we can compute the span.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k, the set of turns T when freeway k is blocked at x=0 (i.e., there is a car that covers 0 at turn T).\n\nThen, when the player is at freeway k at turn T, we must check if T is in the set of blocked turns for k. If yes, then collision.\n\nBut note: the player is at freeway k at turn T only if the player is at y=k at the beginning of turn T (and then moves at the end of the turn). Actually, the rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the freeway corresponding to the player's y at turn T) and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo we need to know the player's y at each turn T.\n\nWe are at turn t1=68, y=3.\n\nWe are going to simulate for each step:\n\nAt turn T (starting at 68), we are at position y_T. Then we choose an action a_T in {U, D, S} which leads to:\n  y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, where delta = +1 (U), -1 (D), 0 (S).\n\nBut note: at turn T, we are at y_T. We check: if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we look at the cars on freeway y_T at turn T: if there is a car that has 0 in its span at turn T, then we have a collision and that action is invalid.\n\nIf we are at y_T=0 or 9, no car, so safe.\n\nThen we move to the next turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H such that we can have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nNote: the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1: the first action at t1, then at t1+1, ... until t1+H-1. Then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at y=9.\n\nWe can do BFS by increasing the number of turns (H). We start at state (t=68, y=3) and we want to reach (t=?, y=9) with minimal turns.\n\nWe'll consider states by the absolute turn number and the y coordinate.\n\nWe'll simulate from turn 68 onward.\n\nBut note: the car positions are given at turn 68, and then we can compute for any future turn T.\n\nWe have to precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) during which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars move at constant speed. The span of a car at turn T is:\n\nFor a left-moving car (d = left? but our cars are given as \"right\" or \"left\"? Actually, the table says \"direction d\": in the example, all are \"right\". So we have:\n\nRight-moving car: at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the update rule:\n\nAt turn T (starting from t1), for a right-moving car that at t1 was [tau, h] (note: the table says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right-moving, the head is the front? and they move right, so the head is the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the example: at t1, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For the first car on freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the head is the front? and at t1, the span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But the update rule says: for right-moving, the span at T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at T=t1, it should be [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? But the table says (head, tail) = (-36, -47) -> so head = -36, tail = -47. Then the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? That makes sense: the car covers from -47 to -36.\n\nBut then at turn T, the car moves to the right: so the entire segment shifts right by s*(T-t1). So the new head = h + s*(T-t1) = -36 + 3*(T-68)\nnew tail = tau + s*(T-t1) = -47 + 3*(T-68)\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we would have: \n  head = h (the leftmost? or the front in the direction of travel) and tail = tau (the back). Then the update: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? Actually the rule says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? and the tail at the right? Actually, the rule does not specify the ordering. But the update rule implies that at t1, the span is [h, tau] (with h being the head and tau the tail) and then both decrease as time goes (since moving left). \n\nHowever, in the given data, we don't have any left-moving car. All are right-moving.\n\nSo we focus on right-moving.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k: given (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, t, d, s) at turn t1=68.\n\nThen at turn T (>=68), the span for that car is:\n  if d == right: [t + s*(T-68), h + s*(T-68)]\n  if d == left: [h - s*(T-68), t - s*(T-68)]\n\nWe then check if 0 is in the interval [low, high] (inclusive?).\n\nBut note: the span is inclusive? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", so we assume inclusive.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, we have a list of cars. We need to know for each turn T, if at least one car on freeway k has 0 in its span.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k the set of turns T (>=68) for which freeway k is blocked at x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars are periodic? Actually, they are infinite lines? But the spans are contiguous intervals. However, because the cars are moving at constant speed and the road is infinite, the blockage at x=0 will occur periodically? But the period might be long? We don't need to compute for all T, but until we have a solution.\n\nWe are going to simulate until we reach y=9. Since we start at y=3 and must go up 6, the minimal H is 6. But we might have to wait, so we might need more than 6 turns.\n\nWe can set a bound: let's say we try until H=20? Because worst-case we might have to wait for a few turns.\n\nBut let's compute the blockage for each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n  Span at T: [ -47 + 3*(T-68), -36 + 3*(T-68) ]\n  We want 0 in [a, b] where a = -47 + 3*(T-68), b = -36 + 3*(T-68)\n  => a <= 0 <= b\n  => -47 + 3*(T-68) <= 0 <= -36 + 3*(T-68)\n\n  First inequality: -47 + 3*(T-68) <= 0 -> 3*(T-68) <= 47 -> T-68 <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666 -> T <= 68 + 15.666 -> T <= 83.666 -> T <= 83 (since integer)\n  Second inequality: 0 <= -36 + 3*(T-68) -> 3*(T-68) >= 36 -> T-68 >= 12 -> T>=80.\n\n  So for T in [80, 83] (inclusive), freeway 1 is blocked at x=0.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) -> same as above: blocked at T in [80,83].\n\nFreeway 3: same: blocked at T in [80,83].\n\nFreeway 4: has three cars:\n  Car1: (-32, -43, right, 4) -> [ -43 + 4*(T-68), -32 + 4*(T-68) ]\n      -43 + 4*(T-68) <= 0 <= -32 + 4*(T-68)\n      First: -43 + 4*(T-68) <=0 -> 4*(T-68)<=43 -> T-68<=10.75 -> T<=78.75 -> T<=78\n      Second: 0<=-32+4*(T-68) -> 4*(T-68)>=32 -> T-68>=8 -> T>=76\n      So T in [76,78]\n\n  Car2: (4, -7, right, 4) -> [ -7+4*(T-68), 4+4*(T-68) ]\n      -7+4*(T-68) <=0<=4+4*(T-68)\n      First: -7+4*(T-68)<=0 -> 4*(T-68)<=7 -> T-68<=1.75 -> T<=69.75 -> T<=69\n      Second: 0<=4+4*(T-68) -> always true for T>=68? but at T=68: 0<=4 -> true. However, we have to check the first part: at T=68: -7<=0 -> true, so T=68 is blocked? But note: we are at turn 68 and we are at freeway 3, not 4. So at turn 68, freeway 4 is blocked? But we are not on it at turn 68.\n\n      Actually, the second inequality is always true for T>=68? because 4+4*(T-68) >=4>0? But the first inequality: \n        -7+4*(T-68) <=0 -> T-68 <= 7/4 = 1.75 -> T in [68, 69] (because T>=68) -> T=68,69.\n\n      So blocked at T=68,69.\n\n  Car3: (40,29,right,4) -> [29+4*(T-68), 40+4*(T-68)]\n      We want 0 in [29+4*(T-68), 40+4*(T-68)] -> \n        29+4*(T-68) <=0<=40+4*(T-68)\n      But 29+4*(T-68) is at least 29 (at T=68) and increases, so 0 is never in this interval.\n\n  So freeway 4 is blocked at T=68,69 (from car2) and T=76,77,78 (from car1). Note: T=70 to 75 and beyond 78 are free? But wait, we must check: at T=70: \n      Car1: [ -43+4*(2)= -43+8=-35, -32+8=-24] -> not covering 0.\n      Car2: [ -7+8=1, 4+8=12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? because 0<1 -> no.\n      Car3: [29+8=37,40+8=48] -> no.\n      So T=70 is free.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 4 is blocked at T=68,69,76,77,78.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\n  Car1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at t1=68: head=0, tail=-11 -> so span at T: [-11+12*(T-68), 0+12*(T-68)] = [ -11+12*(T-68), 12*(T-68) ]\n      We want 0 in [a,b] = [ -11+12*(T-68), 12*(T-68) ]\n      Then: a <=0<=b -> \n        -11+12*(T-68) <=0 -> 12*(T-68)<=11 -> T-68<=11/12<1 -> T-68=0 -> T=68.\n        and 0<=12*(T-68) -> true for T>=68.\n      So at T=68: a = -11, b=0 -> 0 is in [ -11, 0]? yes, because inclusive? so 0 is included.\n\n      So T=68 is blocked.\n\n      At T=69: a=-11+12=1, b=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> not blocked.\n\n      Actually, at T=68: the car covers from -11 to 0. So x=0 is covered.\n\n  Car2: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-68),48+12*(T-68)] -> at T=68: [37,48] -> 0 not covered. And as T increases, the interval moves right. So never covers 0.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 5 is blocked at T=68 only.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: blocked at T=68.\n\nFreeway 7: same: blocked at T=68.\n\nFreeway 8: same: blocked at T=68.\n\nSummary of blocked turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: [80,81,82,83]\nFreeway 2: [80,81,82,83]\nFreeway 3: [80,81,82,83]\nFreeway 4: [68,69,76,77,78]\nFreeway 5: [68]\nFreeway 6: [68]\nFreeway 7: [68]\nFreeway 8: [68]\n\nWe start at turn 68, y=3.\n\nAt turn 68, we are at freeway 3 -> which is not blocked? because freeway 3 is blocked at turns 80-83, not at 68. So we are safe at turn 68.\n\nBut note: freeway 4 is blocked at 68 and 69, freeway 5,6,7,8 are blocked at 68.\n\nOur goal: get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 68.\n\nWe can choose: U (to y=4), D (to y=2), or S (stay at y=3).\n\nBut note: if we move to y=4 at turn 68: \n  At turn 68, we are at y=3 (we are safe at y=3 at turn 68). Then we move to y=4 at the end of turn 68, so at turn 69 we are at y=4.\n\nBut at turn 69: we will be at freeway 4. Is freeway 4 blocked at turn 69? Yes! (from above: freeway 4 blocked at 69). So we would collide at turn 69.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=2 at turn 68: then at turn 69 we are at y=2. Freeway 2 is not blocked at turn 69? because freeway 2 is only blocked at 80-83. So safe.\n\nIf we stay at y=3 at turn 68: then at turn 69 we are at y=3. Freeway 3 is not blocked at turn 69? because only at 80-83. So safe.\n\nBut we want to go up. So let's consider:\n\nOption 1: At turn 68: S -> then at turn 69: at y=3. Then we can try to go up to y=4 at turn 69? But at turn 69, we are at y=3 (safe) then we move to y=4 at the end of turn 69. So at turn 70 we are at y=4.\n\nAt turn 70: freeway 4? We check: freeway 4 is not blocked at turn 70 (only 68,69,76,77,78). So safe.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nBut we are trying to minimize H. The minimal H is 6 (if we can go up 6 times without waiting). However, we cannot go up immediately at turn 68 because that would put us at y=4 at turn 69 (which is blocked). So we must avoid that.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\nTurn 68: S -> then at turn 69: y=3 -> then we do U: at turn 70: y=4 (safe at turn 70? yes).\n\nThen at turn 70: we are at y=4. Then we can do U: to y=5 at turn 71.\n\nAt turn 71: we are at y=5. Is freeway 5 blocked at turn 71? freeway 5 was only blocked at turn 68 -> so at 71, it's clear. Safe.\n\nThen at turn 71: we do U: to y=6 at turn 72.\nAt turn 72: y=6 -> freeway 6: blocked only at 68 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 72: U -> to y=7 at turn 73: safe (freeway7 blocked only at 68).\n\nThen at turn 73: U -> to y=8 at turn 74: safe (freeway8 blocked only at 68).\n\nThen at turn 74: U -> to y=9 at turn 75.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn 75. Then we stop.\n\nTotal turns: from turn 68 to turn 74 (we do 7 actions: turns 68,69,...,74). So H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6?\n\nWe must have 6 moves up. The actions would be: 6 U's. But we start at y=3 at turn 68.\n\nAt turn 68: we must choose an action. If we do U at turn 68: then at the end of turn 68 we are at y=4. But then at turn 69 we are at y=4 -> which is blocked (because freeway4 is blocked at turn69). So we collide.\n\nIf we do S at turn68 and then 6 U's: that would take 7 actions (S and then 6 U's) and we would be at y=9 at turn 74? \n\nBut wait: \n  turn68: S -> y=3 -> safe at turn68 (y=3) and then we are at y=3 at turn69? Actually, we are at y=3 at the beginning of turn69? How does the turn work?\n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, the player is at position y_T. Then we choose an action a_T. Then we update to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, and then we check for collision at turn T: we check the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn68: we are at y=3. We choose an action. If we choose U, then we update: at the end of turn68, we set y_{69} = 3+1=4. Then we check at turn68: we are at y=3 -> check freeway3 at turn68 -> safe. Then we move to the next turn.\n\nAt turn69: we are at y=4. Then we check: freeway4 at turn69 -> blocked? yes -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn68.\n\nWhat if we do D at turn68? Then at turn69 we are at y=2. Then we have to go up 7 times? (from 2 to 9) which would take 7 moves up, so total turns at least 8? which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait one turn and then go up. We did that above and got 7 turns.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 6 turns? We must do 6 U's. We cannot do U at turn68. So we must skip turn68 for moving up. Then we have to do the 6 U's starting from turn69 to turn74? Then at turn74 we are at y=9? But we started at y=3 at turn68.\n\nIf we do nothing at turn68 (S) and then 6 U's at turns69,70,71,72,73,74:\n\n  turn68: S -> y69=3 (we are at y=3 at turn69? Actually: at turn68: we start at y=3, do S -> y69=3. Then at turn69: we are at y=3. Then we do U: y70=4.\n  Then at turn70: we are at y=4 -> safe? (freeway4 at turn70: not blocked) -> safe.\n  Then at turn70: U -> y71=5 -> safe at turn70? we are at y=4 at turn70 -> check freeway4: safe. Then at turn71: we are at y=5 -> then check at turn71: freeway5? safe (only blocked at 68). Then U: y72=6 -> at turn71: we are at y=5 -> safe. Then at turn72: we are at y=6 -> safe. Then U: y73=7 -> safe. Then U: y74=8 -> safe. Then U: y75=9.\n\nBut then at turn75: we are at y=9 -> and we stop? But we did 7 actions: turn68 (S), turn69 (U), turn70 (U), turn71 (U), turn72 (U), turn73 (U), turn74 (U). Then at turn75 we are at y=9. So we don't need an action at turn75? The last action is at turn74.\n\nBut the problem: we are to output actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at the end of the last action we are at (0,9). So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and after that action we are at (0,9). So in this case, H=7: actions at turns 68,69,70,71,72,73,74.\n\nWe reach y=9 at the end of turn74 (i.e., at the beginning of turn75 we are at y=9).\n\nBut we need to check if we can do it in 6 actions? Then we would be at y=9 at turn68+5 = turn73.\n\nHow? We start at y=3 at turn68. We need to get to y=9 in 6 actions (so 6 moves). But we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe must have 6 U's. But we cannot do U at turn68 (because then at turn69 we are at y=4 which is blocked). So we must do the first U at a later turn.\n\nBut we have to do 6 U's. The earliest we can do the first U is at turn69? Then:\n\n  turn68: we do something that is not U? but if we do S or D, then at turn69 we are at y=3 or y=2. Then we do 6 U's: that would take 6 more actions, so total 7 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a detour? But going down would make us take even more moves.\n\nSo it seems 7 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we do:\n\n  turn68: U -> to y=4 (but then at turn69 we are at y=4 and blocked). So that fails.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the freeway4 blockage at turn69? The blockage at freeway4 at turn69 is fixed. So we must not be at freeway4 at turn69.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 7 without collisions? We have a plan:\n\n  turn68: S -> then at turn68 we are at y=3 -> safe (freeway3 not blocked at 68). Then we set y69=3.\n  turn69: we are at y=3 (at the beginning of turn69). Then we do U -> then we set y70=4. But at turn69: we are at y=3 -> safe (freeway3 not blocked at 69). Then we move to turn70.\n  turn70: we are at y=4 -> now check freeway4 at turn70: not blocked (blocked only at 68,69,76,77,78). So safe. Then we do U: set y71=5.\n  turn71: at y=5 -> freeway5: blocked at 68? so at 71 not blocked. Safe. Then U: y72=6 -> safe (freeway6 only blocked at 68).\n  turn72: at y=6 -> safe. Then U: y73=7 -> safe.\n  turn73: at y=7 -> safe. Then U: y74=8 -> safe (freeway8 blocked only at 68).\n  turn74: at y=8 -> safe. Then U: y75=9 -> we are done.\n\nSo we output 7 actions:\n\nTurn 68: S\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\n\nBut wait: at turn74, we are at y=8 and we do U -> then at the end of turn74, we set y75=9. Then at turn75 we are at y=9 and we stop. The last action is at turn74. So H=7.\n\nBut note: we don't need to check turn75? because we are at y=9 and there are no cars. However, the problem says: we must avoid collisions at every turn until we reach (0,9). At turn75, we are at y=9 -> no freeway, so safe.\n\nBut the condition for collision is only when we are on freeways 1-8. So we are safe at turn75.\n\nSo this plan works.\n\nBut is there a shorter plan? We saw that 6 actions are not possible because we must avoid being at freeway4 at turn69.\n\nAlternatively, what if we go down? We start at y=3, and we go down to y=2 at turn68? Then:\n\n  turn68: D -> y69=2. At turn68: we are at y=3 -> safe. Then at turn69: we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 blocked only at 80-83). Then we have to go up 7 times to get to 9. So that would take 8 actions? (D and then 7 U's) -> H=8, which is worse.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut note: we have to worry about freeways 1-3 at turns 80-83? But we are done by turn75, which is before 80. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 68: S\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\n\nBut wait: at turn74, we are at y=8 and we do U -> then we are at y=9. But we must check at turn74: we are at freeway8. Is freeway8 blocked at turn74? From above, freeway8 is only blocked at turn68. So at turn74, it is clear. So safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: S\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t1=68, so t=0 corresponds to turn68, t=1 to turn69, ... t=6 to turn74. So we have H=7.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway4 at turn70: \n  freeway4: cars:\n    car1: at T=70: [-43+4*(70-68)= -43+8=-35, -32+8=-24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> no.\n    car2: [-7+4*2=1, 4+8=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> no.\n    car3: [29+8=37,40+8=48] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAnd freeway5 at turn71: \n  car1: (0,-11,right,12): at T=71: [-11+12*(3)= -11+36=25, 0+36=36] -> 0 not in [25,36] -> no.\n  car2: [37+12*3=37+36=73,48+36=84] -> no.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, and the sequence above is valid.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 68\\) with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined:\n\n- **Turn 68**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\). At turn 68, the player is on freeway 3, which is not blocked (freeway 3 is only blocked at turns 80–83).\n- **Turn 69**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\). At turn 69, the player is on freeway 3 (safe, as freeway 3 is not blocked), and the move updates the position to \\(y = 4\\) for turn 70.\n- **Turn 70**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\). At turn 70, the player is on freeway 4, which is not blocked (freeway 4 is blocked at turns 68, 69, 76–78; turn 70 is safe).\n- **Turn 71**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\). At turn 71, the player is on freeway 5, which is not blocked (freeway 5 is only blocked at turn 68).\n- **Turn 72**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\). At turn 72, the player is on freeway 6, which is not blocked (freeway 6 is only blocked at turn 68).\n- **Turn 73**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\). At turn 73, the player is on freeway 7, which is not blocked (freeway 7 is only blocked at turn 68).\n- **Turn 74**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\). At turn 74, the player is on freeway 8, which is not blocked (freeway 8 is only blocked at turn 68).\n\nAfter the action at turn 74, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 75. The sequence requires 7 turns (actions from turn 68 to turn 74). This is minimal, as attempting to move up immediately at turn 68 would result in a collision on freeway 4 at turn 69, and no shorter sequence avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: S \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on their freeways, and collision happens if at the turn when the player is on a freeway, the x=0 is within the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and only on y+1 starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=70, and for future turns, we calculate their spans based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out the car states clearly for each freeway at t=70:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, h=-30, τ=-41, d=right, s=3. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-41, -30]? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe table says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving: span is [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: span is [τ, h]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so both τ and h increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, both decrease.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nh = -30, τ = -41, d=right, s=3.\n\nSince d=right, the span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1: car: h=-30, τ=-41, d=right, s=3 → span at t_1: [-41, -30]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (-30, -41, right, 3) so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-30, -41, right, 3), same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nFor each: since right-moving, span at t_1:\n\nFirst car: τ=-35? h=-24, τ=-35? No: (head h, tail τ) so for right-moving, span is [τ, h]\n\nSo first car: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=4 → span: [-35, -24]\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=4 → span: [1, 12]\n\nThird car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=4 → span: [37, 48]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (24, 13, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=12 → span: [13, 24]\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12 → span: [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 all have the same: (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12), so spans [13,24] and [-59,-48] for each.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 all have identical car setups.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn 70.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and we start at y=4, we need to move up at least 5 times, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 5, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, when the player is on freeway k (y=k), and at that turn T, the car on freeway k has 0 in its span, meaning x=0 is covered by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision, it's based on y_T at turn T.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T:\n\n- Player is at position (0, y_T)\n\n- Based on action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy\n\n- But for collision check at turn T: we check if y_T is between 1 and 8, and if so, check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1)\"\n\nBut for the current row, at turn T, if y_T is between 1-8, we need to check if 0 is in span at T.\n\nWhen we move, at turn T, we are still on y_T for collision purposes, and only move to new y at T+1.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, we need to compute for each k and each t, if 0 is in some car's span on row k at turn t.\n\nt starts from t_1=70.\n\nLet me define the turn relative to t_1. Set τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn 70.\n\nWe need from τ=0 onwards.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to find actions for τ=0,1,2,... up to some H where y_{τ} =9 at some point, but we need to reach y=9, so at turn t_1 + H -1, y should be 9.\n\nLet the sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position is set, but we need the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nLet's see the indices.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given, y_{t_1} =4.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 + t, after action a_{t_1 + t}, y_{t_1 + t +1} = y_{t_1 + t} + Δy_{t_1 + t}\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe position at turn T is (0, y_T).\n\nIn the sequence, we specify actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so after H actions, the last position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet the turns:\n\n- At time t_1: position y_{t_1} =4\n\n- Action a_{t_1} is applied, determining y_{t_1 +1}\n\n- At time t_1 +1: position y_{t_1 +1}, and collision check based on y_{t_1 +1}? No.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn for the current position.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at y_T, and we check if y_T between 1-8 and if 0 in car span on row y_T at turn T.\n\nThen action a_T is taken, setting y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want to reach y_T =9 for some T.\n\nSince y=9 is the top row, and no cars on y=9, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so no collision possible there.\n\nSo when on y=0 or y=9, no collision check.\n\nOnly on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, we must pass through y=5,6,7,8 or go directly, but since we move one step at a time, we will visit intermediate rows.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so we must be on each row between min and max.\n\nBut we might stay or move down, so not necessarily visit all.\n\nBut to go from 4 to 9, we need to increase y by 5, so at least 5 up moves, but with possible stays or downs, H >=5.\n\nMinimal H is 5 if we can go up directly without collision.\n\nBut we need to check for each row from 4 to 9, but y=4 to y=8 need to be safe when we are on them.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 70), player is on y=4.\n\nIs y=4 safe at τ=0?\n\nFreeway 4 has cars.\n\nFreeway 4: at τ=0, spans: [-35,-24], [1,12], [37,48]\n\nx=0: is 0 in any of these? [-35,-24] is negative, 0 not in; [1,12] is 1 to 12, 0 not in; [37,48], 0 not in. So at τ=0, on row 4, 0 not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to move to higher y.\n\nBut we might stay or move down to avoid future collisions or something, but since we want minimal H, probably we should go up when possible.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row and each turn, if it is occupied at x=0.\n\nDefine occupied(k,t) = True if at turn t, on freeway k, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, but we can compute for each car when 0 is covered.\n\nt is absolute turn, but since t_1=70, set τ = t - 70, so τ=0,1,2,...\n\nFor each freeway k, and car on it, the span at time τ (relative).\n\nAt time t = 70 + τ, span for a car.\n\nFirst, for right-moving cars: initial span at τ=0 is [τ, h], and at time τ, span is [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] because T - t_1 = τ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think? Let me check.\n\nAll cars in the state have direction \"right\", so all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: right, freeway 4: right, freeway 5,6,7,8: right. All right-moving.\n\nSo only right-moving cars.\n\nFor a car with initial (at τ=0) span [τ_init, h_init], speed s, at time τ, span is [τ_init + s*τ, h_init + s*τ]\n\nAnd 0 is in span if τ_init + s*τ <= 0 <= h_init + s*τ\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but none here.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, τ_init = -41, h_init = -30, s=3\n\nSo span at τ: [-41 + 3τ, -30 + 3τ]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 3τ <= 0 <= -30 + 3τ\n\nWhich is -41 + 3τ <= 0 and 0 <= -30 + 3τ\n\nSo 3τ <= 41 and 3τ >= 30, so τ >= 10 and τ <= 13.666, so τ=10,11,12,13\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since identical car, so occupied at τ=10,11,12,13\n\nFreeway 3: same, τ=10,11,12,13\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: τ_init = -35? From earlier: car1: h=-24, τ=-35? Input is (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at τ=0? h=-24, τ=-35, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\ns=4\n\nSpan at τ: [-35 + 4τ, -24 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 4τ <= 0 <= -24 + 4τ\n\nSo -35 + 4τ <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 4τ\n\n4τ <= 35 and 4τ >= 24, so τ <= 8.75 and τ >= 6, so τ=6,7,8\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: h=12, τ=1, s=4, span at τ=0: [1,12]\n\nAt τ: [1 + 4τ, 12 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 4τ <= 0 <= 12 + 4τ? But 1 + 4τ >=1 >0 for τ>=0, so 0 <= 12+4τ always true, but 1+4τ <=0? 1+4τ >=1 >0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for this car at any τ.\n\nSimilarly, third car: h=48, τ=37, s=4, span at τ: [37+4τ, 48+4τ] >=37>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo only first car on freeway 4 can have 0 in span, at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSpecifically τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: h=24, τ=13, s=12, span at τ=0: [13,24]\n\nAt τ: [13 + 12τ, 24 + 12τ] >=13>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12, span at τ=0: [-59,-48]\n\nAt τ: [-59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12τ <= 0 <= -48 + 12τ\n\nSo -59 + 12τ <=0 and 0 <= -48 + 12τ\n\n12τ <=59 and 12τ >=48\n\nτ <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, τ >= 48/12 =4\n\nSo τ=4, since τ integer.\n\nτ=4: 12*4=48, 0 <= -48 + 48 =0, yes 0<=0; and -59+48=-11<=0, yes.\n\nτ=5: -59+60=1>0, so -59+12τ=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not <= since left end >0.\n\nSimilarly τ=3: -59+36=-23<0, but 0 <= -48+36=-12? -12<0, so 0 <= -12 false.\n\nSo only at τ=4, 0 is in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8: all have the same cars, so each has a car that occupies x=0 at τ=4.\n\nSpecifically, the second car on each.\n\nNow, freeway 5,6,7,8 all have the same: occupied only at τ=4 for the second car.\n\nFirst car never.\n\nNow, for freeway 1,2,3: occupied at τ=10,11,12,13\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at τ=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: occupied at τ=4 only? For each, at τ=4.\n\nBut since each freeway is separate, we need per row.\n\nSummarize for each row k, at which τ, x=0 is occupied:\n\n- Row 1: occupied at τ=10,11,12,13\n\n- Row 2: same as row 1, τ=10,11,12,13\n\n- Row 3: same, τ=10,11,12,13\n\n- Row 4: occupied at τ=6,7,8\n\n- Row 5: occupied at τ=4\n\n- Row 6: occupied at τ=4\n\n- Row 7: occupied at τ=4\n\n- Row 8: occupied at τ=4\n\nRow 5,6,7,8 all occupied only at τ=4.\n\nτ=4 relative to t_1=70, so at turn t=70+4=74.\n\nBut we need in terms of turn time.\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0 on y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4, which is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a row when it is occupied at that time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on row 4 at τ=6,7,8, collision.\n\n- If on row 5 at τ=4, collision.\n\n- Similarly for row 6,7,8 at τ=4.\n\n- Rows 1,2,3 at τ=10,11,12,13, but since we are starting from y=4 and going up, we might not go to lower rows, so rows 1,2,3 might not be relevant, unless we move down.\n\nBut since we want to go up, probably no need to go down, so we can ignore rows below 4 for now.\n\nStart at y=4, go to y=9, so we will be on rows 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nWe need to be on these rows at times when not occupied.\n\nNow, row 4: occupied at τ=6,7,8\n\nSo we should not be on row 4 at τ=6,7,8\n\nSimilarly, row 5: occupied at τ=4, so not on row 5 at τ=4\n\nRow 6: occupied at τ=4, not on at τ=4\n\nRow 7: occupied at τ=4, not on at τ=4\n\nRow 8: occupied at τ=4, not on at τ=4\n\nRow 5,6,7,8 all have the same occupied time: only at τ=4.\n\nAt other times, they are safe.\n\nNow, row 4 is safe except at τ=6,7,8.\n\nPlayer starts at τ=0 on y=4, which is safe.\n\nWe need to move up.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's see the dangerous periods:\n\n- For row 4: dangerous at τ=6,7,8\n\n- For rows 5-8: dangerous only at τ=4\n\nSince rows 5-8 are only dangerous at τ=4, and at other times safe, we can be on them except at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 is safe except at τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at τ=0, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to leave row 4 before τ=6, or stay but only if not at bad times.\n\nBut since we want to go up, probably move up soon.\n\nIf we go up immediately, to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, after action, we move to y=1? No.\n\nAt turn τ relative: at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy\n\nBut collision at time τ depends on y_τ.\n\nStart: at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAction a_0: can be U, D, S.\n\nIf a_0=U, then y_1=5\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=4\n\nIf a_0=D, y_1=3, but y=3 is row 3, which has cars, but at τ=0, is row 3 occupied?\n\nRow 3: freeway 3, occupied at τ=10,11,12,13, not at τ=0, so safe, but we want to go up, so moving down might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, staying might delay.\n\nSo probably go up.\n\nBut let's see the constraints.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 5,6,7,8 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, avoid row 4 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, τ=4 is a critical point.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are dangerous only at τ=4, we should not be on any of them at τ=4.\n\nBut we can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly, for row 4, avoid τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at τ=0, we are on y=4.\n\nIf we stay on y=4 for several turns, but at τ=6,7,8 it is dangerous, so we need to leave before τ=6.\n\nτ=6 is 6 turns from now.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, after 6 actions, we are at time τ=6.\n\nTime τ: after τ actions, we have done τ actions, and are at turn t_1 + τ.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, we go to time τ+1 with y_{τ+1}.\n\nTo avoid being on row 4 at τ=6,7,8, we need that for τ=6,7,8, y_τ ≠4.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=4, y_τ should not be 5,6,7, or 8.\n\ny_τ at τ=4 should not be in {5,6,7,8}.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up 5 times, but we might need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up without delay.\n\nSuppose we go up at each step.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=4\n\nAction a_0=U: then y_1=5\n\nNow at τ=1, y=5\n\nIs row 5 safe at τ=1? Row 5 occupied only at τ=4, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nAction a_1=U: y_2=6\n\nτ=2, y=6, row 6 safe except τ=4, so safe.\n\nAction a_2=U: y_3=7\n\nτ=3, y=7, safe.\n\nAction a_3=U: y_4=8\n\nNow at τ=4, y=8\n\nBut τ=4, and y=8, row 8 is occupied at τ=4! Collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we go up directly, at τ=4 we are on y=8, which is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if we were on y=5,6,7 at τ=4, same issue.\n\nSo we cannot be on rows 5-8 at τ=4.\n\nTherefore, in the direct up path, at τ=4 we end up on y=8, which is bad.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 5-8 at τ=4.\n\nOne way is to be on a different row at τ=4.\n\nPossible rows: y=0,1,2,3,4,9 but y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\ny=4 at τ=4: is it safe?\n\nRow 4 is occupied at τ=6,7,8, not at τ=4. τ=4 is before 6, so row 4 is safe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, rows below might be safe, but we want to go up.\n\ny=9 at τ=4: too far, since from y=4, in 4 steps, we can reach at most y=8 if all up, y=9 would take 5 steps.\n\nAt τ=4, after 4 actions, we can be at y between 0 and 8, since start from 4.\n\ny_τ at τ=4: after 4 actions, y could be from 4-4=0 to 4+4=8.\n\nSo at τ=4, y can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut rows 5-8 are dangerous at τ=4, so we must not be on them.\n\nTherefore, at τ=4, we must be on y=0,1,2,3, or 4.\n\ny=4 is safe at τ=4, as established.\n\ny=0,1,2,3 also safe, but we want to go up, so y=4 is fine.\n\nThen, after τ=4, we can go up.\n\nBut we also need to avoid row 4 at later bad times.\n\nRow 4 dangerous at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo if we are on y=4 at τ=4, we need to leave before τ=6.\n\nτ=6 is two steps later.\n\nNow, from τ=4, if on y=4, we can go up to y=5, etc.\n\nBut at τ=4, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nThen action a_4: if U, to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, y=5: is it safe? Row 5 occupied only at τ=4, not at τ=5, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at τ=0 y=4, and at τ=4 we need to be on y<=4 to be safe.\n\nFor example, if we stay on y=4 until τ=4.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4\n\nAction a_0=S: stay, then y_1=4\n\nτ=1, y=4, safe (since not τ=6,7,8)\n\nAction a_1=S: y_2=4\n\nτ=2, y=4, safe\n\nAction a_2=S: y_3=4\n\nτ=3, y=4, safe\n\nAction a_3: now, at τ=3, y=4\n\nWe need to set a_3 so that at τ=4, y_4= something.\n\nIf a_3=S, then y_4=4, which is safe at τ=4.\n\nIf a_3=U, then y_4=5, but at τ=4, y=5 is dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if a_3=D, y_4=3, safe but lower.\n\nSo to be safe at τ=4, we must not go to y=5 or above at τ=4, so action at τ=3 cannot be U if y_3=4, because that would make y_4=5 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we were higher, but we are on y=4.\n\nSo at τ=3, if we do S, y_4=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to leave y=4 before τ=6.\n\nτ=4, y=4\n\nThen action a_4: can go U to y=5, or S or D.\n\nIf U, then y_5=5 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, y=5, row 5 safe since not τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, action a_5=U, y_6=6 at τ=6.\n\nNow τ=6, y=6, row 6 is safe except τ=4, so at τ=6 safe.\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=7 at τ=7, safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=8 at τ=8, safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nNow, we need to check if on row 4 at bad times, but we left row 4 at τ=5? Let's see the positions.\n\nAt τ=0: y=4\n\nτ=1: y=4 (after a_0=S)\n\nτ=2: y=4 (a_1=S)\n\nτ=3: y=4 (a_2=S)\n\nτ=4: y=4 (a_3=S)\n\nThen a_4=U, so at τ=5: y=5\n\nτ=6: y=6\n\nτ=7: y=7\n\nτ=8: y=8\n\nτ=9: y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, safe (not τ=6,7,8)\n\nτ=1: y=4, safe\n\nτ=2: y=4, safe\n\nτ=3: y=4, safe\n\nτ=4: y=4, safe (not τ=6,7,8)\n\nτ=5: y=5, row 5 safe except τ=4, so safe\n\nτ=6: y=6, row 6 safe except τ=4, so safe\n\nτ=7: y=7, safe\n\nτ=8: y=8, safe\n\nτ=9: y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\nH is the number of actions? Let's see.\n\nWe start at τ=0, after H actions, we are at time τ=H with position y_H.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nAt τ=9, y=9.\n\nThe actions: we have actions from τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 actions? Indices.\n\nSequence of actions: from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which affects position at t_1 +1.\n\nIn terms of τ: actions a_τ for τ=0 to H-1, resulting in positions y_1 to y_H, with y_0 given.\n\ny_τ at time τ.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, from above, with actions: at τ=0,1,2,3: S (stay), then τ=4: U, τ=5:U, τ=6:U, τ=7:U, τ=8:U\n\nThen y_0=4, y_1=4 (after a_0=S), y_2=4 (a_1=S), y_3=4 (a_2=S), y_4=4 (a_3=S), then a_4=U, y_5=5, a_5=U, y_6=6, a_6=U, y_7=7, a_7=U, y_8=8, a_8=U, y_9=9.\n\nSo at τ=9, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions? τ from 0 to 8, that's 9 actions? τ=0 to τ=8 inclusive is 9 actions.\n\nThe number of turns: we start at turn t_1, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter first action at t_1, we are at turn t_1+1 with new position.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want position at some turn to be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions for t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the above, with actions at τ=0 to τ=8, that's 9 actions, from t_1 to t_1+8, so at turn t_1+9, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H = t_1 +9, so H=9.\n\nBut we can do better? H=9 seems high.\n\nMinimal H is 5 if no obstacles, but here we had to wait.\n\nPerhaps we can move up but avoid τ=4 on high rows.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, instead of staying, go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nThen we need to not be on y=5,6,7,8 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, we need y_τ <=4.\n\nFrom τ=1, y=5, if we go down, to y=4 at τ=2, for example.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, we can stay or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=4\n\nAction a_0=U: y_1=5 at τ=1\n\nNow τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_1: if we go down, a_1=D, then y_2=4 at τ=2\n\nτ=2, y=4, safe.\n\nAction a_2: now, at τ=2, y=4\n\nWe need at τ=4, y_4 <=4.\n\nIf a_2=S, y_3=4 at τ=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=4\n\nAction a_3: if S, y_4=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nIf U, y_4=5, dangerous.\n\nSo a_3 must be S or D.\n\nSay a_3=S, y_4=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen same as before, from τ=4, y=4, go up: a_4=U, y_5=5 at τ=5, etc., same as before, to y_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut we used a down move, but still H=9.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=5, instead of going down, we stay: a_1=S, then y_2=5 at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen a_2: if S, y_3=5 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen a_3: at τ=3, y=5\n\nTo avoid y=5 at τ=4, we need to move.\n\nIf a_3=S, y_4=5 at τ=4, collision.\n\nIf a_3=U, y_4=6 at τ=4, collision.\n\nIf a_3=D, y_4=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nSo a_3=D, then y_4=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen from there, same as before: a_4=U, y_5=5, etc., to y_9=9.\n\nStill H=9.\n\nAnd we have an extra down move.\n\nWorse or same.\n\nGo up to higher first, but y=6,7,8 have the same issue at τ=4.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, U to y=5 τ=1\n\nThen U to y=6 τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2, y=6\n\nThen we need to get down by τ=4.\n\na_2=D, to y=5 at τ=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5\n\na_3=D, to y=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen from y=4, go up: a_4=U to y=5 τ=5, etc., again to y_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nSame H=9.\n\nBut we have two down moves, inefficient.\n\nSo the first plan with staying on y=4 until τ=4 is better, no down moves.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=9 before τ=9.\n\nWith minimal moves, 5 up moves, but we need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nThe problem is τ=4 for rows 5-8.\n\nIf we can be on y=9 at τ=5, for example.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps, so at τ=5, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=4, we need to not be on rows 5-8, so we must be on y<=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at τ=5, we need to be on y=8 at τ=4, because from y=8, one up to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=4, if on y=8, it is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at τ=4, but y=7 is also dangerous at τ=4.\n\nAny of 5-8 at τ=4 is bad.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at τ=5, we must be on y=8 at τ=4, which is impossible because collision.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 at τ=6: at τ=6, y=9.\n\nThen at τ=5, we must be on y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf on y=8 at τ=5, then action to U to y=9 at τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=4, we need y_4 <=4.\n\nNow, from τ=4 to τ=5, we can move up to 5, but let's see.\n\nSuppose at τ=4, y=4 (safe)\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=5 at τ=5\n\nThen to reach y=9 at τ=6? From y=5 at τ=5, in one step, we can go to y=6 max, not to 9. Impossible.\n\ny_τ at τ=6: to be 9, we need to have come from y=8 or y=9 at τ=5.\n\nIf at τ=5, y=8, then a_5=U, y_6=9.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=8, is it safe? Row 8 safe except τ=4, so at τ=5 safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4, we need y_4 <=4, say y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=4, we can go U to y=5 at τ=5, but not to y=8.\n\nIn one step, only change by 1.\n\nSo from y=4 at τ=4, after one action, at τ=5, y can be 3,4,5.\n\nCannot reach y=8.\n\nSimilarly, to have y=8 at τ=5, we need to be at y=7,8,9 at τ=4, but at τ=4, we cannot be on y=7 or 8, only <=4 or 9, but 9 not possible.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at τ=5 if at τ=4 we are at y<=4.\n\nThus, the earliest to reach y=9 is later.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, y=5 as above, then we need to go up step by step.\n\nFrom y=5 at τ=5, to y=9 at τ=9, with 4 up moves.\n\nBut y=5 at τ=5 to y=6 τ=6, y=7 τ=7, y=8 τ=8, y=9 τ=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the first plan, we had y=5 at τ=5, same.\n\nCan we be higher at τ=5?\n\nFor example, if at τ=4, we are at y=4, then at τ=5, y=5.\n\nIf we can be at higher y earlier, but constrained by τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, we can be higher.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, U to y=5 τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, y=5\n\nThen we can go U to y=6 τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=6\n\nBut at τ=4, we need to be low.\n\nSo at τ=2, y=6, we can go down: a_2=D, to y=5 τ=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5, a_3=D to y=4 τ=4\n\nThen at τ=4, y=4\n\nThen a_4=U to y=5 τ=5, etc., same as before, but we reached y=6 earlier but had to come down, so still y=5 at τ=5, not better.\n\nIf we stay somewhere, but no benefit.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 directly but slower to avoid τ=4 on critical rows.\n\nBut since rows 5-8 are only bad at τ=4, and safe otherwise, we can be on them before or after.\n\nBut the issue is at τ=4 specifically.\n\nNow, back to row 4, we need to avoid τ=6,7,8.\n\nIn the sequence above, we left row 4 at τ=4? In the first sequence, at τ=4 we are still on y=4, then at τ=5 we go to y=5, so we are on row 4 from τ=0 to τ=4 inclusive? Positions:\n\nAt τ=0: y=4\n\nτ=1: y=4\n\nτ=2: y=4\n\nτ=3: y=4\n\nτ=4: y=4\n\nThen τ=5: y=5, so last on row 4 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4 is before τ=6,7,8, so safe.\n\nThen we move up and not on row 4 after that.\n\nNow, τ=6,7,8 we are on y=6,7,8, which are safe at those times.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut can we leave row 4 earlier to save time?\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go up to y=5 immediately.\n\nBut then at τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nBut we need to handle τ=4.\n\nIf we go to y=5 at τ=1, we can stay there or move, but at τ=4, we cannot be on y=5.\n\nSo we must leave y=5 before τ=4 or go down.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, y=5, we can go down to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=4, safe.\n\nThen we need to be at y<=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, we can stay: a_2=S, y_3=4 τ=3\n\na_3=S, y_4=4 τ=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf from τ=2, y=4, we go up at τ=3, but if a_3=U, y_4=5 at τ=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we have to stay or go down at τ=3 to be safe at τ=4.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSo we end up with y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen go up.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we need to start going up earlier, but we hit the τ=4 problem.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=5.\n\nInstead of going down, we go to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=6.\n\nNow, from here, we can go down to y=5 at τ=3, then to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4.\n\nThen from y=4, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5 τ=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6 τ=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=7 τ=7\n\na_7=U, y_8=8 τ=8\n\na_8=U, y_9=9 τ=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at τ=2, we were at y=6, which is higher, but we had to come down.\n\nIn this case, actions: τ=0: U (to y=5)\n\nτ=1: U (to y=6)\n\nτ=2: D (to y=5)\n\nτ=3: D (to y=4)\n\nτ=4: S? At τ=3, if a_3=D, y_4=4\n\nThen τ=4: y=4\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=5\n\netc.\n\nBut y_4=4 same as first plan, but we used extra moves to go up and down.\n\nWorse.\n\nAfter being at y=6 at τ=2, we could stay until τ=3, but at τ=3, y=6, then we need to go down for τ=4.\n\na_3=D, to y=5 at τ=4? At τ=4, if y=5, collision.\n\na_3 must be to go down to y=5 or less, but at τ=4 y=5 is bad.\n\nIf a_3=D, y_4=5 at τ=4, bad.\n\nIf a_3=S, y_4=6 at τ=4, bad.\n\nSo must go down to y=4 or below at τ=4.\n\nSo from y=6 at τ=2, a_2=D to y=5 τ=3, then a_3=D to y=4 τ=4.\n\nStill.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9, with the first plan: stay on y=4 for 5 turns? In first plan, we had actions: a_0 to a_3: S, so y stays 4 from τ=0 to τ=4, that's 5 time steps at y=4, but actions from τ=0 to τ=3 are S, so 4 actions of stay? Let's count actions.\n\nActions: for τ=0,1,2,3: S (4 actions), then τ=4: U, τ=5:U, τ=6:U, τ=7:U, τ=8:U (5 actions of U)\n\nTotal actions: 4 S + 5 U = 9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at τ=9, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=4, we have y=4, which is after 4 actions? Position after actions.\n\nAt τ=0 (after 0 actions): y=4\n\nAfter a_0: at τ=1, y=4 (since S)\n\nAfter a_1: τ=2, y=4\n\nAfter a_2: τ=3, y=4\n\nAfter a_3: τ=4, y=4\n\nAfter a_4: τ=5, y=5\n\n...\n\nAfter a_8: τ=9, y=9\n\nSo actions a_0 to a_8, that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut can we reduce by one?\n\nSuppose we go up one step earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, U to y=5 τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, y=5\n\nNow, we need to be low at τ=4.\n\nSo from τ=1, y=5, we can go down: a_1=D to y=4 τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2, y=4\n\nThen a_2=S, y_3=4 τ=3\n\na_3=S, y_4=4 τ=4\n\nThen a_4=U to y=5 τ=5\n\netc., same as before, but we have an extra U and D, same number of moves to reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\nWorse because we moved unnecessarily.\n\nAfter τ=1 y=5, we stay: a_1=S, y_2=5 τ=2\n\na_2=S, y_3=5 τ=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5, we must go down to avoid τ=4: a_3=D to y=4 τ=4\n\nThen same.\n\nStill.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=9.\n\nThen at τ=7, we must be on y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf on y=8 at τ=7, then a_7=U to y=9 τ=8.\n\nNow, at τ=7, y=8 is safe, since row 8 dangerous only at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at τ=7 safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=4, we need to be at y<=4.\n\nFrom y<=4 at τ=4, to y=8 at τ=7, that's 3 steps: we can go up 3 times, to y=7 at τ=7? From τ=4 to τ=7.\n\nAfter action at τ=4, position at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4 (say)\n\na_4=U, y_5=5 at τ=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6 at τ=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=7 at τ=7\n\nThen at τ=7, y=7\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=8 at τ=8\n\nWe want y=9 at τ=8? Here y_8=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo have y=8 at τ=7, from above, at τ=7 y=7.\n\nIf at τ=4, we start from higher, but at τ=4 we are at y<=4.\n\nMax we can be at τ=7 is y=4 + 3 =7, since 3 up moves.\n\ny_7=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=8, y=9 at τ=9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before τ=9.\n\nIf we can be at y=4 at τ=3, for example.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, then a_3=U, y_4=5 at τ=4, but τ=4 y=5 collision, not good.\n\na_3=S, y_4=4, then as before.\n\nSo indeed, the earliest to reach y=9 is τ=9.\n\nWith the sequence: stay on y=4 for the first 4 actions (τ=0 to τ=3 actions, positions τ=1 to τ=4 at y=4), then up for 5 actions to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nIn terms of actions: actions at τ=0,1,2,3: S\n\nThen τ=4: U\n\nτ=5: U\n\nτ=6: U\n\nτ=7: U\n\nτ=8: U\n\nThen position after a_8: at τ=9, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=70.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 70: a_{70} = S  (since τ=0)\n\nTurn 71: a_{71} = S  (τ=1)\n\nTurn 72: a_{72} = S  (τ=2)\n\nTurn 73: a_{73} = S  (τ=3)\n\nTurn 74: a_{74} = U  (τ=4)\n\nTurn 75: a_{75} = U  (τ=5)\n\nTurn 76: a_{76} = U  (τ=6)\n\nTurn 77: a_{77} = U  (τ=7)\n\nTurn 78: a_{78} = U  (τ=8)\n\nThen at turn 79, position is (0,9), since y_{79} = y_{78} + Δy_{78} = 8 + 1 =9 after a_{78}=U.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =78? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nHere, actions from turn 70 to 78, that's 9 actions: 70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78.\n\nAfter a_{78}, at turn 79, y=9.\n\nSo H=9, turns from 70 to 78 inclusive.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=70.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm if row 4 is safe at τ=4, which it is, and we left before τ=6.\n\nτ=4 is turn 74, y=4, safe.\n\nτ=6 is turn 76, at that time we are on y=6, not 4.\n\nAlso, for rows 5-8, we are on them after τ=4, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=5, turn 75, y=5, which is after τ=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=9.\n\nThen at τ=7, we must be on y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y=8 at τ=7, then a_7=U to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nNow, at τ=7, y=8 must be safe: it is, since τ=7 not 4.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=4, we need y_4 <=4.\n\nFrom y_4 <=4, after 3 actions (τ=4 to τ=7), we can reach at most y=4 +3 =7, so y_7=7.\n\nThen a_7=U to y_8=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut we want y=9 at τ=8, but we have y=8 at τ=8.\n\nTo have y=9 at τ=8, we need to be on y=8 or 9 at τ=7.\n\nIf on y=8 at τ=7, a_7=U to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nBut with y_4 <=4, y_7 <=7, so cannot be at y=8 at τ=7.\n\nIf at τ=7, y=9, but that would require being at y=9 earlier, not possible.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before τ=9.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nAnd the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to start from turn 70.\n\nAlso, in the car state, we have row 4 occupied at τ=6,7,8, which is turn 76,77,78.\n\nIn our sequence, at those times, we are on y=6,7,8, not 4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=4 turn 74, we on y=4, safe.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nBut let me write the actions:\n\nTurn 70: S\n\nTurn 71: S\n\nTurn 72: S\n\nTurn 73: S\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nThen after turn 78 action, at turn 79, y=9.\n\nThe sequence has 9 actions, from turn 70 to 78.\n\nIn the format: \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1.\n\nHere t_1=70, a_{70} to a_{78}, so t from 0 to 8, H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is turn 70)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=9, t_1 + H-1 = 70 + 8 = 78.\n\nSo actions as above.\n\nBut in the initial position, at turn 70, y=4, which is given, no action taken yet.\n\nAction at turn 70 determines y_{71}, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, we start with action at turn 70.\n\nNow, but in the plan, we have 4 S and then 5 U.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=8? We think not.\n\nPerhaps we can move up later but faster, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since row 4 is safe at τ=5? τ=5 is turn 75.\n\nIn our sequence, at τ=5 we are on y=5.\n\nBut row 4 at τ=5: is it occupied?\n\nRow 4 occupied at τ=6,7,8, not τ=5.\n\nSo at τ=5, row 4 is safe.\n\nBut in our sequence, we left at τ=5 to y=5.\n\nSuppose we stay on y=4 until later, but we need to avoid τ=6,7,8.\n\nFor example, if we stay until τ=4, then at τ=4 we are on y=4, then if we stay again, a_4=S, then y_5=4 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, y=4, safe? Row 4 at τ=5: not occupied, since only 6,7,8.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=4, we can go up: a_5=U, y_6=5 at τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=5, safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\na_6=U, y_7=6 τ=7\n\na_7=U, y_8=7 τ=8\n\na_8=U, y_9=8 τ=9\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=9 τ=10\n\nNow we reach y=9 at τ=10, which is later, H=10, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nFrom y=4 at τ=5, we go up multiple times, but still need 5 up moves, so from τ=5 y=4 to y=9 at τ=10.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first plan is better.\n\nAt τ=4, after staying, we go up immediately.\n\nIn our sequence, we go up from τ=4 onwards.\n\nBut at τ=4, we are on y=4, go U to y=5 at τ=5, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 4, we have three cars, but only one affects, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, the answer.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 70: S\n\nTurn 71: S\n\nTurn 72: S\n\nTurn 73: S\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nt_1 = 70\n\nActions: a_{70}, a_{71}, a_{72}, a_{73}, a_{74}, a_{75}, a_{76}, a_{77}, a_{78}\n\nWith values: S, S, S, S, U, U, U, U, U\n\nThen at turn 79, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier if we can be on y=9 at τ=9 but with different timing.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=0, U to y=5 τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, S or something, but we need to be low at τ=4.\n\nSuppose at τ=1, y=5, we go D to y=4 τ=2, but same as before.\n\nI think no better.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 70\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\n- **Freeway 1**: Occupied at turns 80, 81, 82, 83 (relative \\(\\tau = 10, 11, 12, 13\\)).\n- **Freeway 2**: Occupied at turns 80, 81, 82, 83 (relative \\(\\tau = 10, 11, 12, 13\\)).\n- **Freeway 3**: Occupied at turns 80, 81, 82, 83 (relative \\(\\tau = 10, 11, 12, 13\\)).\n- **Freeway 4**: Occupied at turns 76, 77, 78 (relative \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n- **Freeway 5**: Occupied at turn 74 (relative \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- **Freeway 6**: Occupied at turn 74 (relative \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- **Freeway 7**: Occupied at turn 74 (relative \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Occupied at turn 74 (relative \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n\n### Key Constraints\n- Rows 5–8 are dangerous only at turn 74 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)). The player must not be on rows 5–8 at turn 74.\n- Row 4 is dangerous at turns 76, 77, 78 (\\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\)). The player must not be on row 4 at these turns.\n- At turn 70 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), the player is on row 4, which is safe (not occupied at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n\n### Minimal Path\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach (0, 9) is 9, with the following sequence:\n- Stay on row 4 for turns 70 to 73 (positions at turns 70–74: y=4) to avoid being on rows 5–8 at the dangerous turn 74.\n- At turn 74, row 4 is safe (not dangerous until turn 76), so move up to y=5.\n- Then move up continuously to y=9 by turn 79, as rows 5–8 are safe after turn 74.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 70**: Stay (S) – player remains at y=4 (safe).\n- **Turn 71**: Stay (S) – player remains at y=4 (safe).\n- **Turn 72**: Stay (S) – player remains at y=4 (safe).\n- **Turn 73**: Stay (S) – player remains at y=4 (safe at turn 73; also safe at turn 74 after action).\n- **Turn 74**: Up (U) – player moves to y=5 (safe, as turn 74 is past and row 5 is safe after \\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- **Turn 75**: Up (U) – player moves to y=6 (safe).\n- **Turn 76**: Up (U) – player moves to y=7 (safe; row 4 dangerous at turn 76, but player is on y=7).\n- **Turn 77**: Up (U) – player moves to y=8 (safe; row 4 dangerous at turn 77, but player is on y=8).\n- **Turn 78**: Up (U) – player moves to y=9 (safe; row 4 dangerous at turn 78, but player is on y=9).\n\nAfter the action at turn 78, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 79. This sequence avoids all collisions and achieves the goal in \\(H = 9\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 74 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving, at turn T, you're only on y_T, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=74, and for future turns, we calculate based on speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars at t=74:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, right direction, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the head is the front, so at t=74, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No, the notation says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning [tail, head], so head is larger if moving right.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and it moves right, so both increase.\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (head = -48, tail = -59, direction = right, speed = 3)\n\nSince direction is right, the head is the front, so at t=74, the car is from tail to head, which is from -59 to -48, and since moving right, both increase with time.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the span notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right, head > tail, I assume.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59, so head > tail since -48 > -59, so it's right-moving, span [tail, head] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 has three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4). (24,13) — 24 > 13, so head=24, tail=13, so span [13,24]? But direction right, so yes.\n\n(24,13) — if head=24, tail=13, and right-moving, span [13,24] at t=74.\n\nBut 13 to 24, and moving right at speed 4.\n\nSimilarly, (-12,-23): head=-12, tail=-23, so -12 > -23, span [-23,-12].\n\n(-48,-59): [-59,-48].\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12). (0,-11): head=0, tail=-11, so span [-11,0] at t=74? Head=0, tail=-11, direction right, so span [tail, head] = [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the key point is collision when at turn T, player is on freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, always at x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, we need to check if at that turn, for the freeway the player is on, there is a car whose span includes x=0.\n\nIf the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are only on y_T at turn T, not on y_{T+1} until T+1.\n\nThe movement: at turn T, player is at y_T, and chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T, collision is checked based on y_T and the car positions at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, based on y_{T+1} and cars at T+1.\n\nNow, we start at t=74, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, minimum turns is 9, if we go up every turn, but we have to avoid cars on the way.\n\ny from 0 to 9, but freeways are from 1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume, since cars are on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nAt y=0, no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly at y=9.\n\nBut when we are on y=0, we are safe, and when we reach y=9, we are done.\n\nThe player is at (0,y), so when y=0 or y=9, no freeway cars to worry about.\n\nThe danger is only when on y=1 to 8.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but we can stay or move up/down, so we might spend multiple turns on some rows or skip some.\n\nBut since we need to increase y by 9, and min change per turn is 0, but we want min turns, so we should move up as much as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nFor each freeway, and for each car, we need the times when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, we can find for each car the time intervals when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for each freeway, the unsafe times are when at least one car covers x=0.\n\nThen when the player is on that freeway at an unsafe time, collision.\n\nBut since the player position changes, we need to consider the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their movements.\n\nSet t=0 as t_1=74 for simplicity, so current turn is t=0.\n\nThen at turn T (relative to t_1), the car positions are based on T.\n\nFor a car with direction and speed, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*T, τ - s*T]  (since from t1, T=0, span [h,τ], then at T, [h - sT, τ - sT])\n\nIf right-moving: [τ + sT, h + sT]  (at T=0, [τ,h], so at T, [τ + sT, h + sT])\n\nAnd collision if for some car on freeway y, 0 in [low, high] where low and high are the ends.\n\nFor simplicity, since the span is inclusive, 0 in [low, high] means low <= 0 <= high.\n\nNow, let's go freeway by freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=3.\n\nSo right-moving, at time T: span [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 3T, -48 + 3T]\n\n0 in span when -59 + 3T <= 0 <= -48 + 3T\n\nSo -59 + 3T <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3T\n\nFirst: -59 + 3T <= 0 => 3T <= 59 => T <= 59/3 = 19.666, so T <= 19 since T integer? T is turn number, integer.\n\nT relative to t1, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -48 + 3T => 48 <= 3T => T >= 16\n\nSo T >= 16 and T <= 19\n\nThus unsafe on freeway 1 for T=16,17,18,19\n\nT=16: -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11, -48 + 3*16 = -48 + 48 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nT=17: -59+51= -8, -48+51=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nT=18: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6]\n\nT=19: -59+57= -2, -48+57=9, [-2,9]\n\nT=20: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nT=15: -59+45= -14, -48+45= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo yes, T=16 to 19 unsafe for freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48,-59,right,3) identical to freeway 1.\n\nIn the table: freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,3) same as freeway 1.\n\nSo unsafe same times: T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 3: also same (-48,-59,right,3) so T=16-19 unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nAt T: [ -59 +4T, -48 +4T]\n\n0 in: -59+4T <=0 and 0<= -48+4T\n\n-59+4T<=0 => 4T<=59 => T<=14.75 so T<=14\n\n0<= -48+4T => 4T>=48 => T>=12\n\nT>=12 and T<=14\n\nT=12: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0] 0 in\n\nT=13: -59+52= -7, -48+52=4, [-7,4] 0 in\n\nT=14: -59+56= -3, -48+56=8, [-3,8] 0 in\n\nT=11: -59+44= -15, -48+44= -4, [-15,-4] 0 not in\n\nT=15: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12] 0 not in\n\nSo for first car, unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nHead=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=4\n\nAt T: [ -23 +4T, -12 +4T]\n\n0 in: -23+4T <=0 and 0<= -12+4T\n\n-23+4T <=0 => 4T<=23 => T<=5.75, T<=5\n\n0<= -12+4T => 4T>=12 => T>=3\n\nT>=3 and T<=5\n\nT=3: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, [-11,0] 0 in\n\nT=4: -23+16= -7, -12+16=4, [-7,4] 0 in\n\nT=5: -23+20= -3, -12+20=8, [-3,8] 0 in\n\nT=2: -23+8= -15, -12+8= -4, [-15,-4] 0 not in\n\nT=6: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12] 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe T=3,4,5\n\nBut this is for the second car.\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (24,13,right,4)?

Since 13+4T >0 for T>=0, and increases, so 13+4T >=13>0, so 0 never in, because min is 13 at T=0, which is >0.\n\n13+4T >=13>0, so low end >0, so 0 not in span at any T.\n\nSimilarly, head=24, tail=13, so [13,24] all positive, moving right, so x=0 never covered.\n\nSo for freeway 4, unsafe only from first car T=12,13,14 and second car T=3,4,5.\n\nThird car no issue.\n\nSo freeway 4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nAt T: [ -59 +12T, -48 +12T]\n\n0 in: -59+12T <=0 and 0<= -48+12T\n\n-59+12T <=0 => 12T<=59 => T<=4.916, so T<=4\n\n0<= -48+12T => 12T>=48 => T>=4\n\nSo T>=4 and T<=4, so only T=4\n\nT=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0] 0 in\n\nT=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12] 0 not in\n\nT=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12] 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, right, speed=12\n\nAt T: [ -11 +12T, 0 +12T] = [-11+12T, 12T]\n\n0 in span when -11+12T <=0 <= 12T\n\nFirst, 0 <= 12T always true for T>=0, since 12T>=0.\n\nSecond, -11+12T <=0 => 12T <=11 => T<=11/12=0.916, so T<=0\n\nBut T>=0, T=0: -11+0= -11 <=0, and 0<=0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0] at T=0.\n\nFor T>0, -11+12T, at T=1, -11+12=1>0, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=0, -11+12*0 = -11, 12*0=0, so span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nBut T is relative to t1=74, so at turn t1, T=0.\n\nNow, for freeway 5, at T=0, the second car has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so if player is on freeway 5 at T=0, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=0, not on freeway 5, so at T=0, player is on y=0, safe.\n\nFor future turns.\n\nSecond car: unsafe only at T=0.\n\nFirst car unsafe only at T=4.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nT=0: only if on it at T=0, but player not, so for later, unsafe at T=4.\n\nAlso T=0 is unsafe, but since player not there, it doesn't affect when we arrive later.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSo same: unsafe at T=0 and T=4, but T=0 not relevant, so T=4 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, unsafe T=4.\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe T=4.\n\nNow freeway 6,7,8 all have same cars: one like (-48,-59,right,12) unsafe at T=4, and (0,-11,right,12) unsafe at T=0.\n\nBut T=0 not relevant for player.\n\nSo for freeway 5,6,7,8, all unsafe only at T=4? Freeway 5 has unsafe at T=4 from first car.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 5: first car unsafe T=4, second car unsafe T=0.\n\nSo only T=4 is unsafe for freeway 5 when considering player there.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=16-19\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=16-19\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe T=4\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe T=4\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe T=4\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe T=4\n\nNow, player starts at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some H.\n\ny changes slowly.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we can stay there if needed.\n\nBut to min time, probably go up continuously, but may need to wait or skip some turns.\n\nThe unsafe times are concentrated around T=4 and T=3-5,12-14,16-19.\n\nT=4 is unsafe for freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12-14.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 unsafe at 16-19.\n\nNow, player at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince min y step is 1 per turn, min H=9 if no delays.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times on each row.\n\nLet me denote the turn when we are on each y.\n\nSet t as the turn index from start.\n\nAt turn t (relative to t1=74), player at y_t.\n\nt starts from 0: y_0 = 0\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H, min H.\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt each turn t, we are on y_t, and we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway k, and k unsafe at time t.\n\nSince freeways only for y=1 to 8.\n\ny_t from 0 to 9.\n\nAt turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and freeway y_t is unsafe at time t, then collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nWe need to choose a sequence a_t for t=0 to H-1, such that y_t for t=0 to H, with y_0=0, y_H=9, and no collision at any t from 0 to H-1? At turn t, we are at y_t, and collision checked at each turn.\n\nWhen we reach y_H=9, at turn H, we are on y_H=9, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThe turns from t=0 to t=H-1, we are on y_t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAt t=H, y=9, safe.\n\nWe need no collision for t=1 to H-1? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe.\n\nt=1 to H-1: if y_t in 1-8, must be safe at time t.\n\nThen at t=H, y=9, safe.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach, so after H actions, we are at y_H.\n\nStart: after 0 actions, at y_0.\n\nAfter first action, at y_1, and so on, after H actions, at y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nCollision at turn k if at that turn, when we are on y_k, and it is unsafe.\n\nTurn k is after k actions? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nDefine: at time t (turn t), the state is before action or after?\n\nFrom the game dynamics:\n\n\"current turn is t1\", player position (0,y_{t1}), and actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nStandard: at turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t and car positions at turn t.\n\nSo for each turn t, we are at y_t, and if y_t between 1 and 8, we check if freeway y_t is unsafe at time t (relative to t1).\n\nIn terms of relative time, time is t, from 0.\n\nIn the car positions, we used T relative to t1.\n\nSo at absolute turn, it's t1 + T, but since we set T=0 at t1, we use T.\n\nPlayer at relative time T, on y, unsafe if y in 1-8 and freeway y unsafe at time T.\n\nWe start at T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some T=H.\n\nFor each T from 0 to H, we have y_T.\n\nAt T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=H, y=9, safe.\n\nFor T=1 to H-1, if y_T in 1-8, must not be unsafe at time T.\n\nActions: from T=0 to T=H-1, we choose a_T, which changes y to y_{T+1}.\n\ny_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T with Δ in {-1,0,1}, and y between 0 and 9.\n\nMin H such that y_H=9.\n\nSince y starts at 0, ends at 9, the number of up moves must be at least 9, and down moves reduce net, so min H is at least 9, achieved if we go up every turn.\n\nBut with obstacles, we may need more turns by staying or moving down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: same\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe T=4\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe T=4\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe T=4\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe T=4\n\nNote that freeway 4 has two unsafe periods.\n\nWe need to plan a path from y=0 to y=9 over time.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe can choose to move up to y=1 at some point.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be on y=9 at T=H.\n\nTo min H, we should go up as fast as possible, but delay if unsafe.\n\nSince unsafe times are at low T, we might start late, but T=0 is now, we have to start from here.\n\nAt T=0, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, if we move up immediately, to y=1 at T=1.\n\nBut at T=1, what is unsafe?\n\nFirst, let's see the unsafe times for each y.\n\nFor y=1 (freeway 1), unsafe at T=16-19\n\nBut T=1 is not unsafe for y=1, since unsafe only at 16-19.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same, y=3 same.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12-14\n\ny=5: freeway 5, unsafe at T=4\n\ny=6: T=4 unsafe\n\ny=7: T=4\n\ny=8: T=4\n\nNow, at T=1, if we are on y=1, is it unsafe? y=1 unsafe only at T=16-19, so at T=1, safe. Similarly for y=2,3.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5, etc.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway at its unsafe times.\n\nSince min H=9, let's see if we can reach in 9 turns.\n\ny_T for T=0 to 9: y0=0, y1, ..., y9=9.\n\nEach step, y_{T+1} = y_T + a_T, with a_T in {U,D,S}, so |y_{T+1} - y_T| <=1.\n\ny0=0, y9=9.\n\nThe net displacement must be +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and let S be stays.\n\nH turns, y_H - y_0 = sum of Δy = number U minus number D.\n\nSince y_H=9, y0=0, so U - D =9.\n\nTotal actions H, let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, then U + D + S = H, and U - D =9.\n\nThen from U - D =9, U + D + S = H, so 2U + S = H +9, etc.\n\nBut min H when no S or D, U=9, H=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, may need S or D.\n\nFirst, try H=9.\n\ny_T for T=0 to 9: T=0 y=0, T=1 y=1, T=2 y=2, T=3 y=3, T=4 y=4, T=5 y=5, T=6 y=6, T=7 y=7, T=8 y=8, T=9 y=9.\n\nNow check collision at each T from 1 to 8, since y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nT=1: y=1, freeway 1 unsafe only at T=16-19, T=1 not in, so safe.\n\nT=2: y=2, freeway 2, same as 1, unsafe 16-19, T=2 safe.\n\nT=3: y=3, freeway 3, same, unsafe 16-19, T=3 safe.\n\nT=4: y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at T=3,4,5. T=4 is unsafe! Oh, problem.\n\nAt T=4, y=4, freeway 4 is unsafe (from the first period, T=4).\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, if we go straight up, at T=4 we are on y=4 when it is unsafe.\n\nCannot do that.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or something, but in this sequence, we must be on y=4 at T=4 for H=9 with all U.\n\nBut we can change the timing.\n\nFor example, at T=3, if we are on y=3, safe, we can choose to stay or move.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=3 we go to y=4, but we can stay at y=3 for T=4.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTo avoid T=4 on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 is unsafe at T=3,4,5, so we should not be on y=4 at T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, unsafe only at T=4.\n\ny=6,7,8 also unsafe only at T=4.\n\nSo for y=5,6,7,8, we must not be on them at T=4.\n\nNow, T=4 is a critical point.\n\nAlso, freeway 4 unsafe from T=3 to 5.\n\nNow, back to min path.\n\nSince we need to pass y=4, but avoid T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=5-8 at T=4.\n\nNow, possible to delay going up.\n\nFor example, start by staying at y=0 for a few turns, but y=0 safe, but staying there doesn't help to go up, so it increases H, not good for min time.\n\nWe can move up slowly or down to avoid.\n\nSince the unsafe times are early, we might go up to y=3 and stay there until after T=5, then go up.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at T=4? y=3, freeway 3, unsafe only at T=16-19, so at T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2 safe at T=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe T=3,4,5.\n\nSo, one way: go up to y=3 by some time, stay there during T=3,4,5, then after T=5, go up.\n\nBut we also have to avoid y=5-8 at T=4.\n\nT=4 is a single point.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, we can go up to y=3 quickly.\n\nT=0: y=0, action a0: if we go up, to y=1 at T=1.\n\nOr stay, but let's go up.\n\nAssume we go up each turn until we need to stop.\n\nT=0: at y=0, action U, so y1=1\n\nT=1: at y=1, safe (since y=1 unsafe only 16-19), action U, y2=2\n\nT=2: at y=2, safe, action U, y3=3\n\nNow T=3: at y=3, safe. Now, if we go U to y4, but at T=4 we would be on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=3 for T=4.\n\nT=3: action S, so y4=3\n\nThen at T=4, we are at y=3, which is safe, since freeway 3 unsafe only later.\n\nThen at T=4, we are on y=3, safe.\n\nNow, we can go up at T=4 to y=5? No, from y=3, action U to y=4, or D to y=2, or S.\n\nBut at T=4, if we go U to y=4, then at T=5 we are on y=4? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=4, we are at y= y4=3 (from previous).\n\nAfter action at T=4, we go to y5.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt T=4, y_T = y4 =3.\n\nWe choose action a4, which sets y5.\n\nIf a4=U, then y5=4.\n\nThen at turn T=5, we are on y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 is unsafe at T=5? T=5 is in 3,4,5, yes unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=4 at T=5, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=4, we go S, stay at y=3 for T=5.\n\ny5=3.\n\nThen at T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nT=5: at y=3, we can go U to y=4.\n\nThen y6=4.\n\nAt turn T=6, we are on y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 unsafe at T=12-14, but T=6 is not in, and earlier was 3-5, T=6>5, so safe? T=6 not 3,4,5 or 12-14, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we have to worry about y=5-8 at T=4, but T=4 is past.\n\nIn this case, at T=4 we were on y=3, not on y=4 or 5-8.\n\nNow, after T=5, we go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 are unsafe only at T=4, which is past, so no problem later.\n\nBut there is later unsafe at T=12-14 for y=4, and T=16-19 for y=1-3, but we may not be there.\n\nFirst, let's continue the sequence.\n\nAt T=6: y=4, safe, action U, so y7=5\n\nT=7: at y=5, now freeway 5 unsafe only at T=4, which is past, so safe at T=7. Action U, y8=6\n\nT=8: at y=6, safe (unsafe only T=4), action U, y9=7\n\nT=9: at y=7, safe, action U, y10=8\n\nT=10: at y=8, safe, action U, y11=9\n\nNow at T=11, y=9, done.\n\nH=11 turns? T from 0 to 11, 12 states, 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart T=0, y=0\n\nAfter action a0, T=1, y1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a10, T=11, y11=9\n\nSo 11 actions, H=11.\n\ny sequence: T=0: y=0\n\na0=U: T=1 y=1\n\na1=U: T=2 y=2\n\na2=U: T=3 y=3\n\na3=S: T=4 y=3 (stayed)\n\na4=U? At T=4, y=3, we can go U to y=4, but then at T=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIn my earlier, I said at T=4, y=3, action S to stay at y=3 for T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=3, action U to y=4 for T=6.\n\nList:\n\nT=0: y=0, action a0=U → y1=1\n\nT=1: y=1, action a1=U → y2=2\n\nT=2: y=2, action a2=U → y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, action a3=S → y4=3 (so at T=4, y=3)\n\nT=4: y=3, now action: if we go U, y5=4, then at T=5, y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at T=4, action S → y5=3 (stay at y=3 for T=5)\n\nT=5: y=3, action a5=U → y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, action a6=U → y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, action a7=U → y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, action a8=U → y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, action a9=U → y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, action a10=U → y11=9\n\nAt T=11, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check collision:\n\nT=0: y=0, safe\n\nT=1: y=1, freeway1 unsafe only 16-19, T=1<16, safe\n\nT=2: y=2, similar, safe\n\nT=3: y=3, safe\n\nT=4: y=3, safe (freeway3 unsafe only 16-19)\n\nT=5: y=3, safe\n\nT=6: y=4, freeway4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12-14. T=6 not in, so safe\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway5 unsafe only T=4, past, safe\n\nT=8: y=6, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, safe\n\nT=10: y=8, safe\n\nT=11: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=11 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe used 2 extra turns to stay at y=3 during T=4 and T=5.\n\nT=4 and T=5 we stayed, so we delayed.\n\nBut could we do with less?\n\nFor example, at T=3, instead of staying, we could go down or something, but that might not help.\n\nSince freeway 4 unsafe T=3,4,5, we need to avoid being on y=4 during those times.\n\nIn the above, we were on y=4 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nBut we also have the issue at T=4 for y=5-8, but in this case, we were not on them at T=4.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=4 before T=3 or after T=5.\n\nBefore T=3: at T=2, we are on y=2.\n\nIf at T=2 we go U to y=3 at T=3.\n\nBut at T=3, if we go U to y=4, then at T=4 y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=2 we go U to y=3 at T=3, then at T=3 we could go S to stay at y=3 for T=4, same as before.\n\nWe cannot be on y=4 at T=2 or earlier.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, if we go U to y=2 at T=2, or if we go U multiple times, y increases slowly.\n\nAt T=0, y=0, go U to y=1 at T=1\n\nT=1 y=1, go U to y=2 at T=2\n\nT=2 y=2, go U to y=3 at T=3\n\nNow, at T=3, we must not go to y=4 immediately because at T=4 it would be y=4.\n\nBut if at T=3, we go directly to y=4, then at T=4 we are on y=4, unsafe.\n\nWe could go to a different y.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=3, instead of staying, go down to y=2, but then we are moving away, which might take more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nStay only one extra turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, we stayed two turns at y=3: T=4 and T=5, but at T=5 we were still at y=3, then went up at T=6 to y=4.\n\nBut at T=4, we were at y=3, could we go up to y=4 at T=5? But at T=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on y=4 at T=2 or T=6, etc.\n\nT=2: if we are on y=4 at T=2, but from start, at T=0 y=0, T=1 y=1, T=2 y=2, cannot be y=4 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, T=6 is the earliest we can be on y=4 safely, as above.\n\nIn the sequence, we were on y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen from there, we go up each turn to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut y=9 at T=11, H=11 actions.\n\nCan we save a turn?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=4 earlier than T=6.\n\nBut before T=6, y=4 is unsafe from T=3 to T=5.\n\nAt T=2, we are at y=2, cannot be on y=4.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=4 before T=3 or after T=5 except starting from T=6.\n\nT=6 is the first safe time for y=4 after the unsafe period.\n\nUnsafe T=3,4,5, so safe at T=2, but T=2 we are at y=2, not y=4.\n\nAt T=6, we can be on y=4.\n\nNow, another point: at T=4, we need to avoid y=5,6,7,8.\n\nIn our sequence, we were on y=3 at T=4, which is safe.\n\nIf we were on y=4 at T=4, unsafe, or on y=5 at T=4, also unsafe.\n\nBut we avoided.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps we can go directly to higher y during safe times.\n\nFor example, after T=5, we go up to y=4 at T=6, then we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, need 5 up moves, from T=6 to T=11, y=9.\n\nT=6: y=4\n\nT=7: y=5\n\nT=8: y=6\n\nT=9: y=7\n\nT=10: y=8\n\nT=11: y=9\n\nThat's 5 actions to go up 5 levels.\n\nBut we started from T=0 to T=5 at y=3, with y=3 at T=3,4,5.\n\nT=0:0, T=1:1, T=2:2, T=3:3, T=4:3, T=5:3, then T=6:4, etc.\n\nFrom T=0 to T=2, we moved up to y=3 in 3 turns (T=1,2,3? T=0 y=0, T=1 y=1, T=2 y=2, T=3 y=3, so at T=3 y=3.\n\nThen stayed at T=4 and T=5 at y=3.\n\nSo from T=3 to T=5, three turns at y=3, but we arrived at T=3.\n\nThen left at T=5 to y=4 at T=6.\n\nNow, total turns to reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the stay.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe period.\n\nSince freeway 4 unsafe T=3,4,5, we can be on y=4 only at T<=2 or T>=6.\n\nBut T<=2: at T=0 y=0, T=1 y=1, T=2 y=2, cannot be on y=4.\n\nSo only possible at T>=6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, unsafe only at T=4, so we should not be on y=5 at T=4, but can be at other times.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=5 at T=7, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the critical part is around T=4.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is unsafe T=3,4,5, but we can be on other rows.\n\nFor example, at T=3, we are at y=3, instead of staying, we could go up to y=4, but then at T=4 we are on y=4, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo down to y=2 at T=4, but y=2 is safe at T=4, but then we are lower, need to go up later.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=0: y=0, U → y1=1\n\nT=1: y=1, U → y2=2\n\nT=2: y=2, U → y3=3\n\nNow T=3: y=3, instead of S, go D to y=2? Then y4=2\n\nAt T=4, y=2, which is safe (freeway2 unsafe only 16-19)\n\nThen at T=4, y=2, we can go U to y=3, y5=3\n\nThen T=5: y=3, go U to y=4, y6=4\n\nThen same as before, but now at T=6 y=4, then up to y=9 at T=11? Let's see:\n\nT=0: y0=0, a0=U → y1=1\n\nT=1: y1=1, a1=U → y2=2\n\nT=2: y2=2, a2=U → y3=3\n\nT=3: y3=3, a3=D → y4=2  (down to y=2)\n\nT=4: y4=2, a4=U → y5=3\n\nT=5: y5=3, a5=U → y6=4\n\nT=6: y6=4, a6=U → y7=5\n\nT=7: y7=5, a7=U → y8=6\n\nT=8: y8=6, a8=U → y9=7\n\nT=9: y9=7, a9=U → y10=8\n\nT=10: y10=8, a10=U → y11=9\n\nSame as before, H=11.\n\nAnd we have a down move, which might not help.\n\nIn this case, at T=4 we were on y=2, then up.\n\nBut same number of turns.\n\nWe could go directly to y=4 after T=5.\n\nBut we did.\n\nTo save a turn, we need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=4 at T=6, but then we need to go to y=9, which takes at least 5 more turns, so T=11 at best.\n\nUnless we can be on a higher y earlier.\n\nBut at T=4, we cannot be on y=5 or above because to be on y=5 at T=4, we need to have been on y=4 at T=3, but at T=3, if we are on y=4, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=5 at T=4, we must have been on y=4 or y=5 at T=3, but y=4 at T=3 unsafe, or y=5 at T=3, but freeway5 unsafe only T=4, at T=3 if on y=5, is it safe? Freeway5 unsafe only T=4, so at T=3, y=5 should be safe? But we need to be on y=5 at T=3.\n\nBut from start, how to be on y=5 at T=3?\n\ny=0 at T=0, to y=5 at T=3, need to increase by 5 in 3 turns, but |Δy| <=1 per turn, so maximum y=3 at T=3, cannot be higher.\n\nSimilarly, impossible to be on y>=4 before T=4.\n\nAt T=4, we can be on y=4, but unsafe, or on y=3 or y=2 or y=1, but not higher.\n\ny=4 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nSo we must be on y<=3 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=5, we can be on y=4, but unsafe for y=4, or on y=5, but y=5 unsafe at T=4, but at T=5, if on y=5, freeway5 unsafe only T=4, so at T=5 it is safe.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=5, we need to have been on y=4 or y=5 or y=6 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, if on y=4, unsafe; if on y=5, unsafe at T=4; if on y=6, unsafe at T=4.\n\nSo all possibilities are unsafe at T=4 if on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, at T=4, we must be on y=0,1,2, or 3 to be safe.\n\ny=0,1,2,3 are safe at T=4.\n\nIn our sequence, we were on y=3.\n\nNow, at T=5, we can be on y=4, but y=4 is unsafe at T=5, so we cannot be on y=4 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=3,4,5 but y=4 unsafe, y=5 safe at T=5? y=5 freeway5 unsafe only T=4, so at T=5 safe.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=5, we must have come from y=4 or y=5 or y=6 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, if on y=4, unsafe; on y=5, unsafe; on y=6, unsafe. So impossible to be on y=5 at T=5, because to get there, we must have been on an unsafe position at T=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 at T=5: to be on y=4 at T=5, we must have been on y=3,4,5 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, if on y=4, unsafe; if on y=3, safe, then from y=3 at T=4, if we go U, to y=4 at T=5, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=3 at T=5.\n\nOr go D to y=2.\n\nBut cannot go to y=4 or y=5 at T=5 directly without being unsafe at T=4 or before.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way at T=5 is to be on y=3 (if we were on y=3 at T=4), or lower.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nSo in practice, we must be on y=3 at T=5, as in our sequence.\n\nThen at T=5, we go to y=4 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nThus, we cannot avoid having to stay at y=3 for multiple turns around T=4-5.\n\nIn the first sequence, we stayed at y=3 for T=4 and T=5, two turns.\n\nAt T=3 we were already at y=3, so from T=3 to T=5, we are at y=3 for three turns: T=3,4,5, but at T=3 we arrived, and at T=5 we are still there before leaving.\n\nBut the position is occupied.\n\nIn terms of actions, from T=3 to T=4, we used S to stay, and from T=4 to T=5, another S to stay, so two stay actions.\n\nThen from T=5 to T=6, U to y=4.\n\nSo we have two extra stays.\n\nBut since we need to avoid the unsafe times, it seems necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=3 earlier, but at T=3 we are at y=3, which is the earliest.\n\nT=0:0, T=1:1, T=2:2, T=3:3, cannot be faster.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be on y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up faster later, but from y=4 to y=9, min 5 turns, and we reach y=4 at T=6, so y=9 at T=11.\n\nIf we can reach y=4 before T=6, but we cannot because of unsafe times.\n\nAnother point: the later unsafe times, like freeway 4 unsafe at T=12-14, but in our path, we are on y=4 at T=6, which is before T=12, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1-3 unsafe at T=16-19, but by then we are on higher y, so no issue.\n\nIn our sequence, we are not on y=1-3 after T=5, so no problem.\n\nSo H=11 seems achievable and minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used actions: from T=0 to T=2: U, U, U to go to y=3.\n\nThen T=3: S to stay at y=3 for T=4\n\nT=4: S to stay at y=3 for T=5\n\nT=5: U to y=4 at T=6\n\nThen T=6 to T=10: U each to y=7,8,9,10,11? T=6: U to y=5? Let's list y_t:\n\nAfter actions:\n\nAfter a0 (T=0): y1=1\n\na1 (T=1): y2=2\n\na2 (T=2): y3=3\n\na3 (T=3): y4=3 (S)\n\na4 (T=4): y5=3 (S)\n\na5 (T=5): y6=4 (U)\n\na6 (T=6): y7=5 (U)\n\na7 (T=7): y8=6 (U)\n\na8 (T=8): y9=7 (U)\n\na9 (T=9): y10=8 (U)\n\na10 (T=10): y11=9 (U)\n\ny11=9 at T=11.\n\nActions: U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U? 11 actions.\n\na0 to a10, 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, from a5 to a10: U,U,U,U,U,U to go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 actions? a5: U to y6=4, a6:U to y7=5, ..., a10:U to y11=9, so from y5=3 to y11=9, 6 actions, increase by 6, yes.\n\nNow, but we have two S actions.\n\nTo write the actions for the turn.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sequence starting from turn t1=74.\n\nSo actions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 74: a_{74} = U  (since t=0)\n\nTurn 75: a_{75} = U  (t=1)\n\nTurn 76: a_{76} = U  (t=2)\n\nTurn 77: a_{77} = S  (t=3)\n\nTurn 78: a_{78} = S  (t=4)\n\nTurn 79: a_{79} = U  (t=5)\n\nTurn 80: a_{80} = U  (t=6)\n\nTurn 81: a_{81} = U  (t=7)\n\nTurn 82: a_{82} = U  (t=8)\n\nTurn 83: a_{83} = U  (t=9)\n\nTurn 84: a_{84} = U  (t=10)\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn 84.\n\nTurn t1 + H -1? t1=74, H=11, so last action at turn 74 + 10 = 84, position after action at turn 84 is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after a_{84}, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, but in the answer format, it should be the actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then we need to be at y=9 at T=10.\n\ny0=0, y10=9, so net +9 in 10 turns, so possible with 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U but y must be integer, but 10 U would be y=10, which is invalid, since y<=9.\n\ny=9 max, so to reach y=9 in 10 turns, we need exactly 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U minus 1 D, but U and D, net +8 if 9U1D, etc., but must have U - D =9, and U + D + S =10.\n\nThen U - D =9, U + D + S =10, add: 2U + S =19, subtract: 2D + S =1.\n\nSince S >=0, 2D + S =1, so D=0, S=1, then U=9.\n\nOr D=1, S=-1 impossible, so only possibility: 9 U, 0 D, 1 S.\n\nSo one stay.\n\nNow, where to put the stay.\n\nIf we stay early, we might avoid the unsafe.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=0 or something.\n\nBut let's see if we can be on y=4 at T=6 with fewer actions.\n\nIn H=10, we need to reach y=9 at T=10.\n\nNow, to be on y=4 at some point.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=4 safely is T=6, as before.\n\nBut at T=6, if we are on y=4, then to y=9 at T=10, we need to go from y=4 to y=9 in 4 turns, which requires at least 5 steps, impossible since |Δy|<=1, so from y=4 to y=9 min 5 turns: T=6 y=4, T=7 y=5, T=8 y=6, T=9 y=7, T=10 y=8, T=11 y=9. So at best y=8 at T=10, not 9.\n\nIf at T=6 y=4, after 4 actions (to T=10), we can be at y=4,5,6,7,8, but not 9.\n\ny=9 at T=10 requires y at T=9 to be 8 or 9, etc., but from y=4 at T=6, max y=8 at T=10.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by T=10 if we are at y=4 at T=6.\n\nIf we can be on y=4 earlier, but we cannot because unsafe.\n\nFor example, if we are on y=4 at T=2, but impossible.\n\nAt T=5, if we could be on y=4, but at T=5 y=4 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo in any case, we cannot be on y=4 before T=6 safely.\n\nThen at T=6 y=4, we need at least 5 more turns to y=9, so T=11.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have two S actions at T=3 and T=4 relative.\n\nBut T relative to t1.\n\nt1=74.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 74: U  (to y=1)\n\nTurn 75: U  (to y=2)\n\nTurn 76: U  (to y=3)\n\nTurn 77: S  (stay at y=3 for turn 78? Let's clarify the turn numbering.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t=74, y=0, action a_{74}, then at turn t=75, y=y_{75} based on a_{74}, and so on.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 74: y=0, action a_{74}=U → so at turn 75, y=1\n\nAt turn 75: y=1, action a_{75}=U → turn 76, y=2\n\nAt turn 76: y=2, action a_{76}=U → turn 77, y=3\n\nAt turn 77: y=3, action a_{77}=S → turn 78, y=3\n\nAt turn 78: y=3, action a_{78}=S → turn 79, y=3\n\nAt turn 79: y=3, action a_{79}=U → turn 80, y=4\n\nAt turn 80: y=4, action a_{80}=U → turn 81, y=5\n\nAt turn 81: y=5, action a_{81}=U → turn 82, y=6\n\nAt turn 82: y=6, action a_{82}=U → turn 83, y=7\n\nAt turn 83: y=7, action a_{83}=U → turn 84, y=8\n\nAt turn 84: y=8, action a_{84}=U → turn 85, y=9\n\nAt turn 85, y=9, but we need to reach at turn t with y=9.\n\nAfter action at turn 84, we are at y=9 at turn 85.\n\nBut the turn when we are at y=9 is turn 85.\n\nH is the number of turns, from start to end.\n\nStart at turn t1=74, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, after 11 actions, at turn 74 + 11 = 85, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 74 to turn 84 inclusive.\n\nTurn 74 to turn 84: that's 11 turns: 74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84.\n\nAfter a_{84}, at turn 85, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions for turns 74 to 84.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., up to the last action.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn 78, we have action S, but let's confirm the safety.\n\nAt turn 78: what is the time relative? T relative to t1.\n\nTurn 74 is T=0, turn 75 is T=1, ..., up to turn 85 is T=11.\n\nAt turn t, the relative time is t - t1 = t - 74.\n\nSo at turn 74, T=0\n\nTurn 75, T=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 78, T=4 (since 78-74=4)\n\nTurn 79, T=5\n\nEtc.\n\nIn our earlier:\n\nAt turn 78 (T=4), we are at y=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 79 (T=5), y=3, safe.\n\nTurn 80 (T=6), y=4, safe, as before.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, but in the car for freeway 5,6,7,8, we have unsafe at T=4, but we were not on them.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have two S actions, but we can perhaps avoid one if we move differently, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=4, we need to be on y=0,1,2,3, but y=0 is safe, could we go down to y=0?\n\nFor example:\n\nStart at T=0 y=0, go U to y=1 at T=1\n\nT=1 y=1, go U to y=2 at T=2\n\nT=2 y=2, go U to y=3 at T=3\n\nT=3 y=3, go D to y=2 at T=4? But at T=4 y=2, safe.\n\nThen T=4 y=2, go U to y=3 at T=5\n\nT=5 y=3, go U to y=4 at T=6\n\nThen same as before, but we used a down move, which doesn't save time.\n\nGo directly to y=3 and stay only one turn, but we cannot because at T=5 we need to be on y=3 to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nIf at T=4 we are on y=3 and go U to y=4 at T=5, but at T=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think two stays are necessary.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 4 has cars, and we were on it at T=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: S\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nIn the sequence above, after turn 84 U, to y=9 at turn 85.\n\nBut the last action is at turn 84.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's confirm the number: from turn 74 to 84, 11 actions.\n\nTurn t1 to t1 + H -1, H=11, so t1 + 10 = 74+10=84.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut we need to make sure about the later unsafe times, but not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 4 unsafe at T=12-14, but in our path, we are on y=4 at T=6, which is before, and then move up, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 74 with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the sequence of actions must account for the unsafe times on each freeway. The unsafe times, relative to turn 74 (i.e., T = t - 74), are:\n\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe at T=4\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe at T=4\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at T=4\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at T=4\n\nThe player starts at T=0 (turn 74) at y=0, which is safe. The goal is to reach y=9 at some turn with minimal turns (H). Given the constraints, the minimal H is 11, achieved with the following sequence:\n\n- At turn 74 (T=0), action U moves to y=1 at turn 75.\n- At turn 75 (T=1), action U moves to y=2 at turn 76.\n- At turn 76 (T=2), action U moves to y=3 at turn 77.\n- At turn 77 (T=3), action S stays at y=3 for turn 78, avoiding y=4 at T=3 (unsafe for freeway 4).\n- At turn 78 (T=4), action S stays at y=3 for turn 79, avoiding y=4, y=5, y=6, y=7, and y=8 at T=4 (all unsafe).\n- At turn 79 (T=5), action U moves to y=4 at turn 80. T=5 is unsafe for freeway 4, but at T=5, the player is moving from y=3 to y=4, so at turn 79 (T=5), the player is on y=3 (safe), and at turn 80 (T=6), on y=4 (safe, as T=6 is not unsafe for freeway 4).\n- From turn 80 to turn 84, actions U move up one row per turn, reaching y=9 at turn 85. The freeways y=5 to y=8 are unsafe only at T=4 (past), and freeway 4 is unsafe at T=12-14 (future, but the player moves past y=4 before T=12).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turns 74-76: Moving up to y=3, all safe as freeways 1-3 unsafe only at T=16-19.\n- Turns 77-78: Staying at y=3 (safe) during critical T=3-5 for freeway 4 and T=4 for freeways 5-8.\n- Turns 79-84: Moving up from y=3 to y=9, all positions safe as unsafe times are avoided.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is 11, with the player reaching (0,9) at turn 85.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: S \\\\\nTurn 78: S \\\\\nTurn 79: U \\\\\nTurn 80: U \\\\\nTurn 81: U \\\\\nTurn 82: U \\\\\nTurn 83: U \\\\\nTurn 84: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 78, and I'm starting at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements because I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 on that freeway. The collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} based on the action.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t₁. Let τ = t - t₁, so at τ=0, it's turn t₁, y=3.\n\nI need to find actions for τ=0 to τ=H-1 such that at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\ny starts at 3, and I need to reach 9, so I have to move up at least 6 times. But I can also move down or stay, but since I want minimal H, I should go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays, and y is clamped between 0 and 9, but since I'm going up, I don't think I'll hit 0 or 9 early, but when I reach 9, I can stop.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so once I'm at y=9, I don't care about cars there? The freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. The vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, but the freeways are only y=1 to 8 for cars. y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". And the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there. Similarly, y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nBut at each turn, I'm on some y, and if y is between 1 and 8, I need to ensure no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the span moves left, so head decreases; for right-moving, head increases, but the span is defined with head and tail.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the notation, it says head h and tail τ, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the left end? Let's see the example.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nBut -36 and -47, if it's right-moving, and head is larger? -36 > -47, so if head is -36 and tail is -47, that means from -47 to -36? But it's moving right.\n\nI think I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSince it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and tail is the smaller one? In the example, for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nIt says head h, tail τ, but in the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h], so τ should be less than h.\n\nHere, head is -36, tail is -47, and -47 < -36, so τ = -47, h = -36, so span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? But it says (head h, tail τ), which might be confusing.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\nIn the car state table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\"\n\nSo for a car, head and tail are given, but for right-moving, the span is [min, max] = [τ, h] if τ < h.\n\nIn freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, since d=right, and -47 < -36, so span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-47, -36], and it moves right with speed 3.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if d=left, span is [h, τ], but if h is head, it might be larger or smaller.\n\nIn the left-moving update: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so it decreases, so if the car is moving left, the head should be the right end decreasing, so [h, τ] with h > τ, I think.\n\nBut in the data, for freeway 4, there is a car with (-32, -43, right, 4), etc.\n\nFor simplicity, I should just think of the span as an interval that moves left or right.\n\nAt turn T, for a car, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIf right-moving: [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd collision if I am on freeway k at turn T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, t₁ = 78.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t₁, so at relative time τ = ΔT, turn T = t₁ + τ.\n\nFor a car, at relative time τ, the position is:\n\nIf left-moving: span = [h - s τ, τ_tail - s τ] where τ_tail is the tail at t₁.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nIn notation, let's use the given head and tail.\n\nFor a car with (h, t, d, s) at t₁, where t is tail.\n\nFor d = right: span at time τ (relative) = [t + s τ, h + s τ]\n\nBecause at τ=0, [t, h]\n\nFor d = left: span at time τ = [h - s τ, t - s τ]  // since at τ=0, [h, t], and moves left.\n\nIn the left-moving case, if [h, t] with h and t, but if moving left, h should be the right end, so if h > t, then [t, h] would be increasing, but it's defined as [h,t] with h decreasing.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll define the span at τ for each car.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-36, t=-47, d=right, s=3\n\nSo at relative time τ, span = [t + s τ, h + s τ] = [-47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) so same span: [-47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [-47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\nFirst: (-32, -43, right, 4) → span at τ: [-43 + 4τ, -32 + 4τ]\n\nSecond: (4, -7, right, 4) → head=4, tail=-7? tail should be less, -7 < 4, so span = [-7 + 4τ, 4 + 4τ]\n\nThird: (40, 29, right, 4) → head=40, tail=29, 29<40, span = [29 + 4τ, 40 + 4τ]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n\nFirst: (0, -11, right, 12) → head=0, tail=-11, span = [-11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ] = [-11 + 12τ, 12τ]\n\nSecond: (48, 37, right, 12) → head=48, tail=37, span = [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12) → spans [-11 + 12τ, 12τ] and [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 5,6,7.\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 have the same car configuration, each with one car: span [-47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ]\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars: spans [-43 + 4τ, -32 + 4τ], [-7 + 4τ, 4 + 4τ], [29 + 4τ, 40 + 4τ]\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 each have two cars: [-11 + 12τ, 12τ] and [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in these spans for each freeway at various times.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time τ, if 0 is in any of the spans for that k.\n\nThen, I must not be on that freeway at that time.\n\nI start at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=H-1.\n\nSince y changes by -1,0,+1 each turn, and starts at 3, to reach 9, I need at least 6 Up moves, and H at least 6. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be larger.\n\nMinimal H is at least 6.\n\nNow, let's see the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times τ when it is dangerous, i.e., when 0 is in some car span.\n\nFreeway 1 (and 2,3 same): span [-47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 3τ <= 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nSince -47 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 3τ => 3τ >= 36 => τ >= 12\n\nSo for τ from 12 to 15 inclusive? Let's see integer τ, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ is integer, as time in turns.\n\nSo -47 + 3τ <= 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nLeft inequality: -47 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 47 => τ <= floor(47/3) = 15 since 3*15=45<47, 3*16=48>47, so τ <=15? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-47 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/3 = 15 + 2/3, so since τ integer, τ <= 15\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 3τ => 3τ >= 36 => τ >= 12\n\nNow, at τ=12: -47 + 3*12 = -47 + 36 = -11 <=0, and -36 + 36=0, so 0 <=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=13: -47+39= -8 <=0, -36+39=3 >=0, 0<=3 true.\n\nAt τ=14: -47+42= -5 <=0, -36+42=6 >=0.\n\nAt τ=15: -47+45= -2 <=0, -36+45=9 >=0.\n\nAt τ=16: -47+48=1 >0, so 0 not <=1? Lower bound -47+48=1, upper bound -36+48=12, so 1 to 12, 0 not in [1,12], so not.\n\nSimilarly, τ=11: -47+33= -14 <=0, -36+33= -3 <0, so 0 not >= -3? Upper bound -36+33= -3, lower -14, so -14 to -3, 0 not in it.\n\nSo for freeway 1,2,3, dangerous at τ=12,13,14,15.\n\nThat is, from relative time 12 to 15 inclusive.\n\nNow freeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: [-43 + 4τ, -32 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span: -43 +4τ <=0 <= -32 +4τ\n\nLeft: -43+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=43 => τ <= 10.75, so τ <=10\n\nRight: 0 <= -32 +4τ => 4τ >=32 => τ >=8\n\nAt τ=8: -43+32= -11 <=0, -32+32=0, so 0<=0, included.\n\nτ=9: -43+36= -7 <=0, -32+36=4 >=0\n\nτ=10: -43+40= -3 <=0, -32+40=8 >=0\n\nτ=11: -43+44=1 >0, not <=0? Lower bound 1, upper 12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nτ=7: -43+28= -15 <=0, but -32+28= -4 <0, 0 not >= -4, so not.\n\nSo first car dangerous τ=8,9,10\n\nSecond car: [-7 +4τ, 4 +4τ]\n\n0 in span: -7+4τ <=0 <=4+4τ\n\nLeft: -7+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=7 => τ <=1.75, τ<=1\n\nRight: 0 <=4+4τ always true for τ>=0\n\nBut τ <=1\n\nAt τ=0: -7+0= -7 <=0, 4+0=4 >=0, 0 in [-7,4] yes\n\nτ=1: -7+4= -3 <=0, 4+4=8 >=0, yes\n\nτ=2: -7+8=1 >0, not <=0, lower bound 1, upper 12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nτ= -1 not, time starts τ=0.\n\nSo dangerous τ=0 and τ=1\n\nThird car: [29 +4τ, 40 +4τ]\n\n0 in span: 29+4τ <=0 <=40+4τ\n\nBut 29+4τ <=0? 29+4τ >=29>0 for τ>=0, so never <=0, so 0 never in this span since lower bound at least 29.\n\nSo for freeway 4, dangerous only from first and second car: at τ=0,1 from second car, and τ=8,9,10 from first car.\n\nτ=0 and τ=1 from second car, τ=8,9,10 from first car.\n\nNow freeways 5,6,7,8: each has two cars.\n\nFirst car: [-11 +12τ, 12τ]\n\n0 in span: -11+12τ <=0 <=12τ\n\nLeft: -11+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <=11/12 <1, so τ <=0 since integer.\n\nAt τ=0: -11+0= -11 <=0, 0 <=0, so 0 in span.\n\nτ=1: -11+12=1 >0, lower bound 1, upper 12, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=0.\n\nSecond car: [37 +12τ, 48 +12τ], always positive for τ>=0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSo for freeways 5,6,7,8, dangerous only at τ=0 from the first car.\n\nAt τ=0, for freeway 5,6,7,8, the car [-11,0] is present, so 0 is in span, so dangerous.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am at y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt τ=0, freeway 3 is dangerous? Let's see.\n\nFor freeway 3, at τ=0, the car is [-47,-36], which is from -47 to -36, 0 not in it, since -36 <0? -36 to -47 is negative, 0 not in.\n\nEarlier for freeway 1,2,3, dangerous only from τ=12 to 15.\n\nAt τ=0, freeway 3: car span [-47,-36], all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut for freeway 5,6,7,8 at τ=0, car [-11,0], so 0 is included, dangerous.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 5,6,7,8 at τ=0, I am on y=3, freeway 3, which is safe at τ=0.\n\nNow, back to the danger times.\n\nSummary per freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous τ=12,13,14,15\n\n- y=2: same as y=1, τ=12-15\n\n- y=3: same, τ=12-15\n\n- y=4: dangerous τ=0,1 (from second car) and τ=8,9,10 (from first car)\n\n- y=5: dangerous only τ=0\n\n- y=6: same, τ=0\n\n- y=7: same, τ=0\n\n- y=8: same, τ=0\n\ny=4 has τ=0,1 and τ=8,9,10.\n\ny=5 to 8 only τ=0.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3 at τ=0 is safe, since for y=3, dangerous only at τ=12-15, not at 0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4 is dangerous because of the second car on freeway 4, span [-7,4] at τ=0, includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 dangerous at τ=0.\n\nBut I am not on them.\n\nNow, I need to move up from y=3.\n\nMinimal H: I need to go up 6 times, so if I go up every turn, I can reach y=9 in 6 turns: from τ=0 to τ=5, actions U,U,U,U,U,U, then at τ=5, y=3+5=8? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, start y=3\n\nAfter action at τ=0, move to y at τ=1.\n\nDefine the position at the beginning of each turn.\n\nAt turn τ, before action, position is y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with bounds.\n\nBut at turn τ, I am at y_τ during the turn, so I need y_τ to be safe for that turn.\n\nThen I choose action, move to y_{τ+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn terms of collision: at turn T, I am on y_T, and I need that no car on freeway y_T has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nThen after action, I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn relative time τ.\n\nAt relative time τ, I am at position y_τ, and I choose action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nThe collision depends on y_τ at time τ.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for τ=0 to H-1, such that at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nAnd for each τ, y_τ is not a freeway or if it is, not dangerous at that τ.\n\nBut y=1 to 8 are freeways, y=0 and 9 are not, so always safe.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous (y,τ) pairs.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor y=1: dangerous τ=12,13,14,15\n\ny=2: same τ=12-15\n\ny=3: τ=12-15\n\ny=4: dangerous τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=5: dangerous only τ=0\n\ny=6: only τ=0\n\ny=7: only τ=0\n\ny=8: only τ=0\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=5-8 dangerous only at τ=0.\n\nNow, I am at y=3, τ=0, safe.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are dangerous only at τ=0, which is past, so for τ>=1, they are safe, because no other danger times.\n\ny=5: only τ=0 dangerous, so for τ=1,2,3,... safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10. So for τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,11,... safe except 8,9,10.\n\ny=1,2,3 dangerous at τ=12,13,14,15.\n\nNow, since I need to reach y=9, and y=9 is safe always.\n\nI start at y=3, τ=0.\n\nI can go up immediately.\n\nIf I go up at τ=0, action U, then y_{1} = 4.\n\nBut at τ=1, I will be at y=4.\n\nNow, at τ=1, y=4 is dangerous? From above, y=4 dangerous at τ=1, yes, because τ=1 is dangerous for y=4.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 4 has the second car? At τ=1, for the second car on y=4, span [-7+4*1, 4+4*1] = [-3,8], which includes 0, so yes dangerous.\n\nSo if I go to y=4 at τ=1, I would collide.\n\nAction at τ=0: if I do U, y_{1} =4, but at turn τ=1, I am on y=4, which is dangerous.\n\nIf I do S, y_{1}=3, still on y=3, which is safe at τ=1, since y=3 dangerous only later.\n\nIf I do D, y_{1}=2, but y=2 is safe at τ=1.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=4 is dangerous at τ=1, I should not be on y=4 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0, y=4 is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nSo for τ=1, I need to avoid y=4.\n\nPossible to be on y=3 or y=2 or y=5? But y=5 at τ=1: y=5 dangerous only at τ=0, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nBut to go to y=5 from y=3, I need to go through y=4 or move directly, but I move one step at a time.\n\nFrom y=3, at τ=0, if I do U, I go to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=1 is dangerous.\n\nIf I do S, I stay at y=3 at τ=1, safe.\n\nIf I do D, go to y=2 at τ=1.\n\ny=2 at τ=1 is safe, since dangerous only τ=12-15.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nI could wait at y=3 until it is safe to move.\n\nBut y=3 will be dangerous later at τ=12-15, but that's far.\n\nSince y=4 is dangerous only at τ=1 and then at τ=8-10, so for τ=2 to7, y=4 is safe, except τ=8,9,10 dangerous.\n\nτ=0,1 dangerous, then safe until τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=5-8 are safe for all τ except τ=0, which is past.\n\nSo for τ>=1, y=5,6,7,8 are always safe.\n\ny=4 is safe for τ=2,3,4,5,6,7, and dangerous at τ=8,9,10.\n\nNow, I am at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAt τ=0, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I do U, I go to y=4 at τ=1, but τ=1 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I do S, I stay at y=3 at τ=1, safe.\n\nIf I do D, go to y=2 at τ=1, safe.\n\nBut since I need to go up, staying or going down might delay.\n\nSo probably I should stay at τ=0.\n\nAction at τ=0: S, so y_{1} =3 (same as before).\n\nNow at τ=1, I am at y=3, which is safe.\n\nNow I can choose action for τ=1.\n\nI want to go to y=4, but at τ=1, y=4 is dangerous, so I cannot go to y=4 at τ=1? If I do U at τ=1, I go to y=4 at τ=2? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn τ, I am at y_τ.\n\nI choose action a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nAt turn τ, the position is y_τ, and collision check is for y_τ at time τ.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, I am at y_τ = y_1.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{2} = y_1 +1.\n\nBut at turn τ=1, I am on y_1, so if y_1 is dangerous at τ=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo at τ=1, I am at y=3 (since I did S at τ=0).\n\ny=3 at τ=1 is safe.\n\nIf I do U at τ=1, then I would go to y=4 at τ=2? No.\n\nAfter action at τ=1, y_{2} = y_1 +1 if U.\n\nBut at turn τ=1, I am on y_1=3, which is safe.\n\nThen I do action, and move to y_2 for the next turn.\n\nSo if I do U at τ=1, then y_2 = 4.\n\nThen at turn τ=2, I am on y=4.\n\nNow, at τ=2, is y=4 dangerous? From above, y=4 dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10, so at τ=2, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I do S at τ=1, stay at y=3.\n\nOr D to y=2.\n\nBut I want to go up.\n\nSo at τ=1, I can do U, then at τ=2, I will be at y=4, which is safe since τ=2 not dangerous for y=4.\n\nThen from there I can go up further.\n\ny=4 safe at τ=2.\n\nThen I can go to y=5 at τ=3, etc.\n\nBut y=5 is safe for all τ>=1.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway, but dangerous only at τ=0, so safe for τ>=1.\n\nNow, the only issue is later with y=1,2,3 at τ=12-15, but since I am going up, I might not be there at that time if I go fast.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=3, safe. Action: since if I U, go to y=4 at τ=1, but τ=1 y=4 dangerous, so I should not do U at τ=0.\n\nInstead, I did S at τ=0, so at τ=1, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can do U, so action U, then y_2 =4.\n\nAt τ=2, I am at y=4, which is safe (τ=2 not dangerous).\n\nThen at τ=2, I can do U, go to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, which is safe (since τ>=1).\n\nAction U, y_4=6.\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, safe.\n\nU, y_5=7.\n\nτ=5, y=7, safe.\n\nU, y_6=8.\n\nτ=6, y=8, safe? y=8 dangerous only at τ=0, so at τ=6, safe.\n\nU, y_7=9.\n\nAt τ=7, y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe, and I reached y=9.\n\nNow, what about τ=7? I reached at τ=7, with y=9.\n\nSequence: from τ=0 to τ=6 actions? Let's list.\n\nAt τ=0: action S, so I stay, y_1=3\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y_1=3.\n\nAt τ=1: I am at y=3, action U, so y_2=4\n\nAt τ=2: at y=4, action U, y_3=5\n\nAt τ=3: at y=5, action U, y_4=6\n\nAt τ=4: at y=6, action U, y_5=7\n\nAt τ=5: at y=7, action U, y_6=8\n\nAt τ=6: at y=8, action U, y_7=9\n\nThen at τ=7, I am at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nH is the number of turns, from τ=0 to H-1.\n\nI started at τ=0, and after H actions, I am at turn t₁ + H.\n\nAt turn t, position before action.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions from t₁ to t₁ + H - 1, so at turn t₁ + H, I am at position y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, from above, at τ=7, y=9, which is after 7 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nAt relative time τ=0: turn t₁, position y=3, take action a_{t₁}\n\nAfter action, position for next turn.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, position is y for τ=1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have executed actions for τ=0 to H-1, and the position at turn t₁ + H is y_H.\n\nAnd I need y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\n- After action at τ=0 (S), position at τ=1 is y=3\n\n- After action at τ=1 (U), position at τ=2 is y=4\n\n- After action at τ=2 (U), position at τ=3 is y=5\n\n- After action at τ=3 (U), position at τ=4 is y=6\n\n- After action at τ=4 (U), position at τ=5 is y=7\n\n- After action at τ=5 (U), position at τ=6 is y=8\n\n- After action at τ=6 (U), position at τ=7 is y=9\n\nSo at τ=7, y=9, which is what we want.\n\nI took actions from τ=0 to τ=6, that is 7 actions: τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 3 to 9, min 6 moves up, but here I took 6 Up and one Stay, so 7 actions.\n\nCould I do it in 6?\n\nIf I could go directly without staying.\n\nBut at τ=0, if I go U, to y=4 at τ=1, but τ=1 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I go to y=5 or something, but I can only move to adjacent y.\n\nAnother way: at τ=0, I could go down to y=2, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=2, then up, but y=2 is safe at τ=1, but then I need to go up more.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo probably 7 is minimal in this case.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I am at dangerous position.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, safe\n\nAction S\n\nAt τ=1: y=3, safe (since y=3 not dangerous at τ=1)\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=2: y=4, and τ=2, which is safe for y=4 (dangerous only 0,1,8,9,10)\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=3: y=5, safe (τ=3 >=1, y=5 safe)\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=4: y=6, safe\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=5: y=7, safe\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=6: y=8, safe (τ=6, y=8 safe)\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=7: y=9, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, but earlier I thought about y=4 dangerous at τ=8,9,10, but I was at y=4 at τ=2, which is fine.\n\nAnd I reached y=9 at τ=7, before τ=8.\n\nτ=7 is early.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=6?\n\nSuppose I start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nIf I could be at y=4 at τ=2 directly, but I can't.\n\nAt τ=0, if I do nothing, but I have to take action.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I do D, go to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, do U, go to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, safe? τ=2, y=3 dangerous only at 12-15, so safe.\n\nThen do U to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, which is safe? τ=3, not dangerous for y=4.\n\nThen continue up: to y=5 at τ=4, y=6 τ=5, y=7 τ=6, y=8 τ=7, y=9 τ=8.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at τ=8, with actions: D at τ=0, U at τ=1, U at τ=2, U at τ=3, U at τ=4, U at τ=5, U at τ=6? Let's see.\n\nStart τ=0: y=3, action D, so y_1=2\n\nτ=1: y=2, action U, y_2=3\n\nτ=2: y=3, action U, y_3=4\n\nτ=3: y=4, action U, y_4=5\n\nτ=4: y=5, action U, y_5=6\n\nτ=5: y=6, action U, y_6=7\n\nτ=6: y=7, action U, y_7=8\n\nτ=7: y=8, action U, y_8=9\n\nAt τ=8, y=9, with 8 actions, worse than before.\n\nNot better.\n\nAfter going to y=2, I could go up faster, but I still need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal is 6 up moves, so at least 6 actions, but with waiting, more.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had one stay, 7 actions.\n\nCan I avoid the stay?\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I do U, but I go to y=4 at τ=1, which is dangerous, so collision, not allowed.\n\nI have to not be on y=4 at τ=1.\n\nSo I must be on another y at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, possible safe y: y=1,2,3,5,6,7,8? y=1: at τ=1, dangerous? y=1 dangerous at τ=12-15, not at τ=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 safe.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 at τ=1 safe.\n\nBut from y=3 at τ=0, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at τ=1.\n\ny=4 is dangerous, so only y=2 or y=3.\n\nIf I go to y=2 or stay at y=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, from there I can go to y=3,4, or from y=2 to y=1,2,3.\n\nBut to go up, I need to go to y=4 eventually.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=4 safely is τ=2, as in the first sequence.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=2, I can go up each turn to y=5 at τ=3, y=6 τ=4, y=7 τ=5, y=8 τ=6, y=9 at τ=7.\n\nWith actions: at τ=0: S (to stay at y=3 for τ=1), then U to y=4 at τ=2, etc.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at τ=1, then to y=3 at τ=2, then to y=4 at τ=3, which is later, so I reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, at τ=3 y=4, then y=5 τ=4, y=6 τ=5, y=7 τ=6, y=8 τ=7, y=9 τ=8, so τ=8, worse.\n\nSo the first sequence with stay at τ=0 is better.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is there another way?\n\nWhat about going directly to higher y.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at τ=0, I can only go to y=4, but dangerous.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at τ=2, which I did.\n\nBut y=4 is dangerous at τ=8,9,10, but I am there at τ=2, early.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to y=8 at τ=6, is there any issue?\n\ny=8 at τ=6, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 at τ=12-15 dangerous, but I am at y=9 before that, so fine.\n\nSo with H=7, it seems possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions relative to t₁.\n\nt₁=78.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn t₁ + 0: action S\n\nt₁ + 1: action U\n\nt₁ + 2: action U\n\nt₁ + 3: action U\n\nt₁ + 4: action U\n\nt₁ + 5: action U\n\nt₁ + 6: action U\n\nAfter that, at turn t₁ + 7, position y=9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence: actions from t=t₁ to t=t₁+6, so 7 actions, H=7.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t₁ to t₁ + H-1, so indices t=78 to 78+6=84.\n\nAfter action at t=84, position at t=85 is y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is S)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 6: a_{t_1 + 6} (U)\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 5-8 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, I was on y=3, not affected.\n\nIn the sequence, I never was on y=5-8 at τ=0, so fine.\n\nAnother thing: when I go from y=4 to y=5, at turn when I am on y=4, I move to y=5, but at that turn, I am still on y=4, so as long as y=4 is safe at that time, no collision with cars on y=5, but the collision is only with cars on the current freeway.\n\nThe note says: if I move to different y at turn T, I am not considered on the new y until next turn, so I don't collide with cars on new y at turn T.\n\nIn this case, when I move from y=4 to y=5 at some turn, at that turn, I am on y=4, so only cars on y=4 matter, not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y=5, the next turn, I am on y=5, then cars on y=5 matter.\n\nBut in our case, for y=5, only dangerous at τ=0, which is past, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the sequence should be fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=2, I am on y=4, which is freeway 4, and at τ=2, is it safe?\n\nτ=2, freeway 4: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10, so τ=2 is safe.\n\nCars: first car at τ=2: [-43 +4*2, -32+8] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35,-24], not include 0.\n\nSecond car: at τ=2, [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], not include 0.\n\nThird car: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nNow, H=7, but is it minimal?\n\nSuppose I go up faster but avoid the danger.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, I do U, but since y=4 at τ=1 dangerous, I cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=3 and then at τ=1, since y=4 dangerous, I stay or something, but that would take more time.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, S, stay.\n\nτ=1, on y=3, safe.\n\nBut at τ=1, if I do S again, stay at y=3, then at τ=2, I can go to y=4, same as before, but I wasted a turn staying, so I reach later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach in 6.\n\nSuppose actions: all U from τ=0 to 5.\n\nThen:\n\nτ=0: start y=3, action U, go to y=4 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, I am on y=4, which is dangerous, collision. Not possible.\n\nIf I do U at τ=0, but to avoid collision, impossible.\n\nSo must have at least one non-up move, so H at least 7.\n\nThus, minimal H=7 with one stay at beginning.\n\nIn the sequence, I have S at first, then all U.\n\nBut in the actions, I have one S and six U, total seven actions.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nt₁=78.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 85, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn t₁ + H -1 = 78 + 6 = 84, action U, leading to y=9 at next turn.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 78: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nWith t_1=78.\n\nH=7, so turns from 78 to 84.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at any point I might be on y=4 at dangerous time, but in this sequence, I am on y=4 only at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nAnd y=1,2,3 not visited after τ=1 except y=3 at τ=1, safe.\n\ny=3 at τ=1 is safe.\n\nAll good.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 78\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time, based on the car states and movement rules.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Initial Position:** At turn \\(t_1 = 78\\), the player is at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (relative time) since freeway \\(y = 3\\) is dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 12\\) to \\(15\\).\n- **Dangerous Times for Freeways:**\n  - \\(y = 4\\) is dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\) due to cars on freeway 4.\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 0\\).\n  - \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) are dangerous at \\(\\tau = 12\\) to \\(15\\).\n- **Strategy:** \n  - At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 78), staying at \\(y = 3\\) (action \\(S\\)) avoids moving to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\), which is dangerous.\n  - At \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 79), moving up to \\(y = 4\\) (action \\(U\\)) is safe because \\(\\tau = 1\\) is not dangerous for \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (the player arrives at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n  - From \\(\\tau = 2\\) to \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turns 80 to 84), moving up each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turn 85) safely, as:\n    - \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 2\\) is safe (dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9, 10\\)).\n    - \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are safe for all \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\).\n    - The goal \\(y = 9\\) is reached before the dangerous times for \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) (\\(\\tau = 12\\) to \\(15\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- The sequence consists of one stay action (\\(S\\)) at the start to avoid the danger at \\(y = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 1\\), followed by six up actions (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns.\n- Actions are taken from turn \\(t_1 = 78\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 78 + 6 = 84\\), resulting in position \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(85\\).\n\n### Verification of Safety:\n- **Turn 78 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)):** Player at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 car span \\([-47 + 3(0), -36 + 3(0)] = [-47, -36]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 79 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)):** Player at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 car span \\([-47 + 3(1), -36 + 3(1)] = [-44, -33]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 80 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)):** Player at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 cars:\n  - First car: \\([-43 + 4(2), -32 + 4(2)] = [-35, -24]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([-7 + 4(2), 4 + 4(2)] = [1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Third car: \\([29 + 4(2), 40 + 4(2)] = [37, 48]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 81 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)):** Player at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 cars:\n  - First car: Only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\), so safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\).\n  - Second car: \\([37 + 12(3), 48 + 12(3)] = [73, 84]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 82 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)):** Player at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 cars similar to freeway 5, safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\) → safe.\n- **Turn 83 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)):** Player at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 cars similar, safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\) → safe.\n- **Turn 84 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)):** Player at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 cars:\n  - First car: Only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 0\\), so safe.\n  - Second car: \\([37 + 12(6), 48 + 12(6)] = [109, 120]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 85 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)):** Player at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway → safe and goal reached.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 7\\) turns, which is minimal because:\n- At least 6 up moves are required to go from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- Moving up immediately at \\(\\tau = 0\\) would place the player at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\), which is dangerous and causes a collision.\n- Any sequence with a down move or additional stays would take more than 7 turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 78: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: & U \\end{array} }",

The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed, and I collide only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y where for that freeway, at that turn, the car's span includes 0. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check for collisions on the y I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=84, and I need to find where they are at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at t=84.\n\nFor each freeway k, the cars are given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nDirection: right means head is greater than tail? Let me see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] for Δt = T - t1.\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] moves to [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt].\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, it says span is [τ, h], so head is h, tail is τ, and since it's right-moving, h > τ, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h < τ? But in the update, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h and τ such that it moves left.\n\nIn the table, all directions are \"right\" for these cars.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) → since right, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t=84.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same, [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same, [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h], so:\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, so span [-59, -48] at t=84\n\nSecond car: τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23, -12]\n\nThird car: τ=13, h=24? Head and tail: (h, τ) = (24, 13), so τ=13, h=24, span [13, 24] at t=84.\n\nBut direction right, so moving right, so at time T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: τ=-11, h=0, span [-11, 0]\n\nh=0, τ=-11, so span [-11, 0] at t=84.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 all have two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12), so same as freeway 5.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 from y=0. Since y=9 has no cars, I only care about freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThat is, if the car's span includes x=0 at time T.\n\nSince the player is at (0, y), so x=0 always.\n\nSo for each freeway and each car, I need to know when the car covers x=0.\n\nBut only for the freeway I am on at that time.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and y=0 is not a freeway, no cars there, so no collision at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 has no cars.\n\nSo only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nI need to go through y=1 to 8 without being on a freeway when a car is covering x=0.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimum possible is 9 turns if I go up every time, but I might have to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when cars cover x=0.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=84 being current.\n\nSet Δt = t - 84, so at t=84, Δt=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with direction, speed, and span at Δt=0.\n\nFor right-moving car: span at time t is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIt covers x=0 when 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], so τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, the times when it covers x=0.\n\nBut it might cover multiple times if it passes multiple times, but since it's moving continuously, and we're at discrete turns, but the span is linear, so for each car, there might be an interval of Δt when it covers x=0.\n\nSince the car moves at constant speed, and we're checking at integer turns, so for each car, the set of Δt where τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nThen, for a given freeway, if at time t, for any car on that freeway, the span includes 0, then if I'm on that freeway, I collide.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions: each turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince I start at y=0, and want to go to y=9, and it's a grid, the shortest path is 9 up moves, but I might need to avoid certain times on certain y.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, the dangerous times when x=0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h,τ,d,s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince right, span at Δt=0: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time t: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 3 Δt, -48 + 3 Δt]\n\nCover x=0 when -59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/3 = 19.666, so Δt <= 19 since integer? Δt integer.\n\nt is integer, Δt integer.\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt => 48 ≤ 3 Δt => Δt >= 16\n\nAnd -59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 19.666, so Δt <= 19\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt => 3 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 16\n\nAnd the inequality: lower bound <= 0 <= upper bound\n\nSo -59 + 3 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 3 Δt\n\nWhich is  -59 + 3 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3 Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 3 Δt <= 0 => 3 Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 19.666, so Δt <= 19\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 3 Δt => 48 <= 3 Δt => Δt >= 16\n\nSo for Δt = 16,17,18,19\n\nCheck:\n\nAt Δt=16: -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11 <=0, and 0 <= -48 + 48 =0, yes 0<=0\n\nAt Δt=17: -59+51= -8 <=0, 0 <= -48+51=3, yes\n\nΔt=18: -59+54= -5 <=0, 0 <= -48+54=6, yes\n\nΔt=19: -59+57= -2 <=0, 0 <= -48+57=9, yes\n\nΔt=20: -59+60=1 >0, not <=0, so not covered.\n\nLower bound -59+60=1, which is >0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <=1 is true, but -59+60=1 <=0? 1 <=0 is false, so the inequality fails.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=15: -59+45= -14 <=0 true, but 0 <= -48+45= -3? 0 <= -3 false.\n\nSo only Δt=16,17,18,19.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous at t = 84 + 16 = 100, 101, 102, 103? t=84 + Δt.\n\nt = 84 + Δt, so dangerous turns: t=100,101,102,103\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48,-59,right,3) so same dangerous times: t=100,101,102,103\n\nFreeway 3: same, t=100,101,102,103\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 4 Δt, -48 + 4 Δt]\n\nCover 0 when -59 +4 Δt <=0 <= -48 +4 Δt\n\n-59+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=59 => Δt <=14.75, so Δt<=14\n\n0 <= -48 +4 Δt => 48 <=4 Δt => Δt >=12\n\nSo Δt=12,13,14\n\nCheck:\n\nΔt=12: -59+48= -11 <=0, 0<= -48+48=0, yes\n\nΔt=13: -59+52= -7 <=0, 0<= -48+52=4, yes\n\nΔt=14: -59+56= -3 <=0, 0<= -48+56=8, yes\n\nΔt=11: -59+44= -15 <=0 true, 0<= -48+44= -4? false\n\nΔt=15: -59+60=1 <=0 false\n\nSo dangerous Δt=12,13,14, t=84+12=96, 97, 98\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nτ=-23, h=-12\n\nSpan: [-23 +4 Δt, -12 +4 Δt]\n\nCover 0: -23+4Δt <=0 <= -12+4Δt\n\n-23+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=23 => Δt <=5.75, Δt<=5\n\n0 <= -12+4Δt => 12 <=4Δt => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt=3,4,5\n\nt=84+3=87, 88, 89\n\nΔt=3: -23+12= -11 <=0, 0<= -12+12=0, yes\n\nΔt=4: -23+16= -7 <=0, 0<= -12+16=4, yes\n\nΔt=5: -23+20= -3 <=0, 0<= -12+20=8, yes\n\nΔt=2: -23+8= -15 <=0 true, 0<= -12+8= -4? false\n\nΔt=6: -23+24=1 <=0 false\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13? (h,τ) = (24,13), direction right, so span [τ, h] = [13,24] at Δt=0\n\nAt time t: [13 + 4 Δt, 24 + 4 Δt]\n\nCover 0: 13+4Δt <=0 <=24+4Δt\n\nBut 13+4Δt >=13>0 for Δt>=0, so left bound always >0, so 0 <= left bound false, so never covers x=0, since it starts at 13 and moves right, all positive, never reaches 0.\n\nSo only first two cars dangerous on freeway 4.\n\nDangerous times: for car1: t=96,97,98\n\nCar2: t=87,88,89\n\nSo overall freeway 4 dangerous when either car, so t=87,88,89 and t=96,97,98\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) τ=-59, h=-48\n\nSpan: [-59 +12 Δt, -48 +12 Δt]\n\nCover 0: -59+12Δt <=0 <= -48+12Δt\n\n-59+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=59 => Δt <=59/12=4.916, so Δt<=4\n\n0 <= -48+12Δt => 48 <=12Δt => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt=4\n\nΔt=4: -59+48= -11 <=0, 0<= -48+48=0, yes\n\nΔt=3: -59+36= -23 <=0 true, 0<= -48+36= -12? false\n\nΔt=5: -59+60=1 <=0 false\n\nSo only Δt=4, t=88\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11\n\nSpan: [-11 +12 Δt, 0 +12 Δt] = [-11 +12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\nCover 0: -11+12Δt <=0 <= 12Δt\n\nNow, 0 <= 12Δt always true for Δt >=0\n\nAnd -11+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/12=0.916, so Δt<=0\n\nSo only when Δt=0\n\nAt Δt=0, -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nSo covers at t=84 exactly.\n\nBut at t=84, we are at turn t1=84, and we are at y=0, not on freeway 5, so for us, when we are on freeway 5 at some turn, we need to avoid when cars cover 0.\n\nAt t=84, we are not on freeway 5, since we are at y=0.\n\nFor freeway 5, dangerous times: from first car at t=88, and second car only at t=84, but t=84 we are not on it.\n\nSo only dangerous at t=88 when first car covers 0.\n\nt=88.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same, covers at t=88\n\nSecond car: covers only at t=84\n\nSo dangerous at t=88 for freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, dangerous at t=88\n\nFreeway 8: same, dangerous at t=88\n\nNow, also for freeways 5-8, the second car covers at t=84, but since we are not on freeway at t=84 (y=0), it's fine.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at t=100,101,102,103\n\nFreeway 2: same, t=100,101,102,103\n\nFreeway 3: same, t=100,101,102,103\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at t=87,88,89 (from car2) and t=96,97,98 (from car1)\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous only at t=88\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous only at t=88\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous only at t=88\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous only at t=88\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at turn t=84, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, which determines y for next turn? Let's see the player update.\n\nPlayer: at turn t, position (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if at that turn, y_T is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, 0 is covered by some car at turn T.\n\nThe position y_t is for the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position (0, y_T), and we are on freeway y_T if y_T in 1-8.\n\nThen, if at that turn, for freeway y_T, the car spans include 0 at turn T.\n\nThen we collide.\n\nAfter choosing action, we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only on y_T at turn T.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, for each turn T when I am on freeway y (1-8), it must not be dangerous at that turn for that freeway.\n\nNow, I start at t=84, y=0, not on freeway.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn t=84 + H -1 or something.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nSet t=84 as turn 0 for simplicity? But t is given, so better to use absolute turns.\n\nSet τ = t - 84, so time from now.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, at time τ, we have y_τ, which is the position at the start of turn t=84 + τ.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, we set y_{t+1}.\n\nFor turn t, at start, position (0,y_t), then we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision is checked at the start of turn t, before action? I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nThen, when we are at turn T, we are at y_T, and we check if for freeway y_T, 0 covered.\n\nThen we choose action to go to next position.\n\nSo, at the moment we are at y_T, if y_T in 1-8 and dangerous, we collide.\n\nIf we move, we are not on new y yet.\n\nSo, for example, if I am on y=5 at turn T, and freeway 5 is dangerous at T, I collide.\n\nIf I move to y=6 at turn T, then at turn T, I am on y=5, not y=6, so I don't care about freeway 6 at turn T; I care when I am on it.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: I can go directly up in 9 turns, but I need to avoid the dangerous times on the freeways.\n\nLet me list the dangerous times per freeway:\n\ny=1: dangerous at τ=16,17,18,19 (t=100,101,102,103)\n\ny=2: same, τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=3: same, τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=4: dangerous at τ=3,4,5 (t=87,88,89) and τ=12,13,14 (t=96,97,98)\n\ny=5: dangerous only at τ=4 (t=88)\n\ny=6: dangerous only at τ=4 (t=88)\n\ny=7: dangerous only at τ=4 (t=88)\n\ny=8: dangerous only at τ=4 (t=88)\n\nτ=4 is t=88.\n\nNow, since I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9 is by going up every turn, so at τ=9, y=9.\n\nBut I need to see if I can do that without colliding.\n\nLet's simulate going straight up.\n\nAt each turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nτ=0, t=84, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nAction U, then y=1 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, t=85, y=1. Freeway 1 dangerous? y=1 dangerous at τ=16-19, not now, so safe. Action U, y=2 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2, t=86, y=2. Safe, not dangerous. Action U, y=3 at τ=3.\n\nτ=3, t=87, y=3. Freeway 3 dangerous at τ=16-19, not now, so safe. Action U, y=4 at τ=4.\n\nNow τ=4, t=88, y=4. Now, freeway 4 is dangerous at τ=3,4,5? τ=3,4,5 are dangerous for y=4.\n\nτ=4 is dangerous for y=4.\n\nAt τ=4, t=88, y=4, and freeway 4 dangerous, so collision!\n\nCannot be on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nSo straight up path collides at t=88 when going to y=4.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps stay or go down at some point.\n\nSince y=4 is dangerous at τ=3,4,5 and also at τ=12,13,14.\n\nBut τ=3,4,5 are early.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are all dangerous only at τ=4, which is t=88.\n\nAt τ=4, if I am on y=5,6,7, or 8, I collide because all are dangerous at that time.\n\ny=5 dangerous at τ=4, similarly y=6,7,8.\n\nSo at τ=4 (t=88), no matter which freeway I am on, if I am on y=1 to 8, it is dangerous, because:\n\n- y=1,2,3: not dangerous at τ=4, since dangerous at τ=16-19\n\ny=1 dangerous at τ=16-19, not at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=3,4,5\n\ny=5 dangerous at τ=4\n\ny=6 at τ=4\n\ny=7 at τ=4\n\ny=8 at τ=4\n\nSo at τ=4, specifically:\n\n- If on y=4, dangerous\n\n- If on y=5, dangerous\n\n- If on y=6, dangerous\n\n- If on y=7, dangerous\n\n- If on y=8, dangerous\n\n- If on y=1, not dangerous, since dangerous later\n\n- Similarly y=2,3 not dangerous at τ=4\n\ny=1 dangerous only at τ=16-19, so at τ=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 safe at τ=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=4.\n\ny=5-8 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nSo at τ=4, the only safe freeways are y=1,2,3.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but at τ=4, I might not be there.\n\nIn the straight up path, at τ=3, I was at y=3, which is safe, then I went to y=4 at τ=4, which is dangerous.\n\nBut at τ=4, I am at y=4, which is dangerous.\n\nTo avoid, at τ=3, instead of going up to y=4, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at τ=3, since dangerous only later.\n\nSimilarly, let's see the options.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nSince at τ=4, it's dangerous for y=4 to 8, and y=1-3 are safe, so I should be on y=1,2, or 3 at τ=4.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, I could be at y=3, and instead of going up, I stay at y=3 for τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, which is safe, since y=3 not dangerous at τ=4.\n\nThen later I can go up.\n\nBut I need to go through the higher freeways.\n\ny=5-8 are only dangerous at τ=4, so at other times, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 dangerous at τ=3,4,5 and τ=12,13,14.\n\nBut τ=3,4,5 are early, τ=12-14 later.\n\nSince I want minimal turns, I should try to go up as soon as possible after the dangerous time.\n\nFirst, let's handle the τ=4 problem.\n\nAt τ=4, I must not be on y=4 to 8, so I should be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9.\n\nBut y=0 or 9 might not be possible.\n\nSo, at τ=4, I should be on y=1,2, or 3.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=1,2,3 by τ=4.\n\nI can go up slowly or something.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and the dangerous time is only at τ=4 for y=4-8, and at other times they are safe.\n\ny=4 has additional dangers.\n\nBut let's first get past τ=4.\n\nSo, at τ=4, I want to be on y<=3.\n\nStart from τ=0, y=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at τ=1, y=2 at τ=2, y=3 at τ=3, and at τ=4, if I stay at y=3, I am safe.\n\nThen, after that, I can go up.\n\nBut when I go up from y=3, I go to y=4 at next turn.\n\nNow, at what τ?\n\nAfter τ=4, I can go up at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, t=89, y=4? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=4, I am at y=3.\n\nChoose action: if I go up, to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nNow, at τ=5, y=4, is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at τ=3,4,5 and τ=12,13,14.\n\nτ=5 is dangerous for y=4.\n\nAt τ=5, if I am on y=4, I collide.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at τ=4, then at τ=5, I am still at y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at τ=5, since dangerous only at τ=16-19.\n\nThen I can go up to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6, t=90, y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 dangerous? τ=6 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 are safe except at τ=4.\n\nτ=4 is past, so at τ=6, I go to y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=5 at τ=7, y=6 at τ=8, y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nNow, check for each:\n\nAt τ=6, t=90, y=4: safe, as above.\n\nτ=7, t=91, y=5: freeway 5 dangerous only at τ=4, not now, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at τ=8, safe.\n\ny=7 at τ=9, safe.\n\ny=8 at τ=10, safe.\n\ny=9 at τ=11, not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, what about the later dangers? For example, y=4 dangerous at τ=12,13,14, but at τ=12, I am at y= something else.\n\nIn this path, at τ=12, I am at y= since I reach y=9 at τ=11, so at τ=12, I might be at y=9 if I stay, but I reach at τ=11, so for later turns, I don't care.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach, so once I reach y=9, I stop.\n\nIn this case, at τ=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, total turns: from τ=0 to τ=11, that's 11 turns, so H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart at τ=0, t=84, y=0.\n\nAction: to go to y=1 at τ=1, so a_{84} = U\n\nThen τ=1, t=85, y=1, action U to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2, t=86, y=2, action U to y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3, t=87, y=3, now instead of U, I need to stay to avoid going to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, I choose S (stay), so y_{τ=4} = y_3 +0 =3\n\nThen τ=4, t=88, y=3, safe, now I choose S again? Or U?\n\nIf I choose U, I go to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=4 is dangerous.\n\nSo I need to choose S at τ=4 to stay at y=3.\n\nThen at τ=4, t=88, y=3, action S, so y=3 at τ=5.\n\nThen at τ=5, t=89, y=3, now I can choose U to go to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6, t=90, y=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at τ=7\n\nτ=7, t=91, y=5, safe\n\nU to y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8, t=92, y=6, safe\n\nU to y=7 at τ=9\n\nτ=9, t=93, y=7, safe\n\nU to y=8 at τ=10\n\nτ=10, t=94, y=8, safe\n\nU to y=9 at τ=11\n\nτ=11, t=95, y=9, reached.\n\nH=11 turns? From t=84 to t=95, that's 12 turns? Let's see.\n\nt=84: start, after action, position at t=85.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=84: y=0\n\nAfter action a_{84}, y_{85} set.\n\nThen at t=85, position y_85, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t in 1-8 and dangerous at t.\n\nIn terms of τ, set τ = t - 84.\n\nAt τ=0, t=84, y=0\n\nAfter action, y at τ=1 (t=85)\n\nGenerally, at time τ, position y_τ, which is for turn t=84 + τ.\n\nThen after action, y_{τ+1} set.\n\nCollision at time τ if y_τ in 1-8 and for freeway y_τ, dangerous at time τ.\n\nIn the above path:\n\nτ=0: t=84, y=0, safe, action U, so y_{1} =1\n\nτ=1: t=85, y=1, safe (not dangerous), action U, y_{2}=2\n\nτ=2: t=86, y=2, safe, action U, y_{3}=3\n\nτ=3: t=87, y=3, safe, now action: if I choose U, y_{4}=4\n\nThen at τ=4: t=88, y=4, dangerous, collide.\n\nSo instead, at τ=3, I choose S, so y_{4} = y_3 =3\n\nThen τ=4: t=88, y=3, safe (y=3 not dangerous at τ=4), action: I need to go up, but if I choose U, y_{5}=4\n\nThen τ=5: t=89, y=4, dangerous? Freeway 4 dangerous at τ=3,4,5, so τ=5 is dangerous, yes.\n\nSo if I go to y=4 at τ=5, I collide.\n\nTherefore, at τ=4, I must not go to y=4 yet.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=3, I choose S again, so y_{5} =3\n\nThen τ=5: t=89, y=3, safe, now action U, y_{6}=4\n\nτ=6: t=90, y=4, now τ=6, not dangerous for y=4 (dangerous at 3,4,5 and 12,13,14), so safe.\n\nAction U, y_{7}=5\n\nτ=7: t=91, y=5, safe (dangerous only at τ=4)\n\nAction U, y_{8}=6\n\nτ=8: t=92, y=6, safe\n\nU, y_{9}=7\n\nτ=9: t=93, y=7, safe\n\nU, y_{10}=8\n\nτ=10: t=94, y=8, safe\n\nU, y_{11}=9\n\nτ=11: t=95, y=9, reached.\n\nSo at τ=11, y=9, so I reached at turn t=95, which is after 11 steps? From t=84 to t=95, the turns are t=84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95? That's 12 turns.\n\nt=84: initial, before any action.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach at turn t=84 + H.\n\nDefine:\n\nStart at turn t=84, position given.\n\nAfter first action a_{84}, move to position at t=85.\n\nAfter second action a_{85}, position at t=86, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=84 + H.\n\nI reach when position is (0,9) at some turn T.\n\nIn this case, after H actions, at turn t=84 + H, y=9.\n\nFor example, in the path above:\n\nAfter action a_{84} U, at t=85, y=1\n\nAfter a_{85} U, t=86, y=2\n\nAfter a_{86} U, t=87, y=3\n\nThen a_{87} S, at t=88, y=3\n\na_{88} S, at t=89, y=3? Let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn t | action a_t | position after action, at t+1? Better to list position at start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn t: position y_t\n\nThen choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy\n\nThen at start of next turn, position y_{t+1}\n\nCollision during turn t if at that position y_t, dangerous.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=84: y=0, safe (no freeway), choose a_{84} = U, so y_{85} = 1\n\nt=85: y=1, safe (since y=1 not dangerous at t=85, τ=1), choose a_{85} = U, y_{86} =2\n\nt=86: y=2, safe, choose a_{86} = U, y_{87} =3\n\nt=87: y=3, safe (τ=3, not dangerous), now choose a_{87} = S (stay), so y_{88} =3\n\nt=88: y=3, safe (τ=4, y=3 not dangerous), choose a_{88} = S (stay), so y_{89} =3\n\nt=89: y=3, safe, choose a_{89} = U, so y_{90} =4\n\nt=90: y=4, now τ=6 (t=90, 90-84=6), freeway 4 dangerous at τ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14. τ=6 not in, safe. Choose a_{90} = U, y_{91} =5\n\nt=91: y=5, τ=7, safe (dangerous only τ=4), choose U, y_{92} =6\n\nt=92: y=6, τ=8, safe, choose U, y_{93} =7\n\nt=93: y=7, τ=9, safe, choose U, y_{94} =8\n\nt=94: y=8, τ=10, safe, choose U, y_{95} =9\n\nt=95: y=9, reached.\n\nSo reached at turn t=95, which is after 11 actions: from a_{84} to a_{94}, and position at t=95.\n\nActions: a_{84} to a_{94}, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nt from 84 to 94 inclusive, that's 11 turns.\n\nt=84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94: 11 actions.\n\nPosition reached at t=95.\n\nNow, is this minimal?\n\nI could reach earlier if I go faster or avoid differently.\n\nFor example, at t=87, y=3, instead of staying, I could go down to y=2, but that might take more turns.\n\nOr, another idea: since y=4 is dangerous at τ=3,4,5, which are t=87,88,89, but at τ=6 it is safe, so I can go later.\n\nBut I need to pass through y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=5-8 are only dangerous at τ=4, so I can be on them at other times.\n\nAt τ=4, I must be on y=1,2,3.\n\nIn the above, I was on y=3 at τ=4.\n\nI could be on y=1 or 2.\n\nBut since I start from y=0, going to y=3 by τ=4 is fine.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier than τ=11?\n\nFor example, if I don't stay twice.\n\nSuppose at τ=3, t=87, y=3, I choose D to go down to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=2 is safe at τ=4, then I can go up from there.\n\nBut I go down, then need to come up, might take more turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=87: y=3, choose D, so y_{88}=2\n\nt=88: y=2, safe, choose U, y_{89}=3\n\nt=89: y=3, safe, choose U, y_{90}=4\n\nThen same as before, but I wasted a turn going down and up.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=87, y=3, choose S, so y_{88}=3 (as before)\n\nThen at t=88, y=3, instead of S, I choose U to go to y=4 at t=89.\n\nBut at t=89, y=4, which is τ=5, dangerous, collide.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo I must stay at least one extra turn at y=3.\n\nIn the path, I stayed two extra turns: at t=87 S and t=88 S.\n\nBut at t=88 I stayed, but I could go to another y.\n\nAt t=88, y=3, I could go down to y=2, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 are safe at τ=4, I could be there.\n\nBut I need to be at low y at τ=4.\n\nFor example, start by going up to y=1 quickly, but I have to.\n\nMinimal time: to reach y=9, I need at least 9 up moves.\n\nBut I have to take some S or D to avoid the danger.\n\nIn this case, I have two S actions, so total moves: 9 U and 2 S, so 11 actions.\n\nCan I do with one S?\n\nSuppose I go up to y=2 or something earlier.\n\nAt τ=0, t=84, y=0, I could choose S to stay at y=0 for one turn, but that delays.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo up to y=3 by τ=3 as before.\n\nThen at τ=3, t=87, y=3, I must not go to y=4 at τ=4 because dangerous, and I cannot go to y=4 at τ=5 because also dangerous for y=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=3,4,5.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at τ=3,4,5.\n\nTherefore, I must avoid being on y=4 during τ=3 to 5, i.e., t=87 to 89.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5-8, I must avoid only at τ=4.\n\nBut since I need to pass through, I have to go after τ=5 for y=4.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=4 is at τ=6, as in the path.\n\nThen y=5 at τ=7, etc.\n\nNow, to be on y=4 at τ=6, I need to be at y=3 at τ=5 or something.\n\nAt τ=5, if I am at y=3, I can go to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nWhere can I be at τ=4? I need to be on y<=3.\n\nAt τ=3, I can be at y=3, and choose S to stay for τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=3, choose S to stay for τ=5? Or choose U to go to y=4 at τ=5? But τ=5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nSo I must choose S at τ=4 to stay at y=3 for τ=5.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3, choose U to go to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nSo I need two stays: one at τ=3 and one at τ=4, both at y=3.\n\nIn terms of actions: at t=87 (τ=3), choose S to keep y=3 for t=88.\n\nAt t=88 (τ=4), choose S to keep y=3 for t=89.\n\nAt t=89 (τ=5), choose U to go to y=4 at t=90.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nNo way to avoid two extra turns.\n\nI could be at lower y at τ=4.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=2, t=86, y=2, I choose S instead of U, so y_{87}=2.\n\nThen at t=87, y=2, safe, I can choose U to y=3 at t=88.\n\nt=88, y=3, safe (τ=4), then choose U to y=4 at t=89.\n\nBut t=89, y=4, τ=5, dangerous! Collide.\n\nIf at t=88, y=3, I choose S to stay, y_{89}=3.\n\nThen t=89, y=3, choose U, y_{90}=4, same as before.\n\nBut I spent an extra S at t=86, so I have three S, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nStart from y=0, go to y=1 at t=85, then at t=85, y=1, I could stay or something, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=1 at τ=1, then stay at y=1 for a while.\n\nAt t=85, y=1, choose S, so y_{86}=1.\n\nt=86, y=1, choose S, y_{87}=1.\n\nt=87, y=1, choose U, y_{88}=2.\n\nt=88, y=2, safe, choose U, y_{89}=3.\n\nt=89, y=3, safe, choose U, y_{90}=4.\n\nt=90, y=4, safe, as before.\n\nThen up to y=5 at t=91, etc., up to y=9 at t=95? Let's see:\n\nt=90: y=4\n\nU to y=5 at t=91\n\ny=5 at t=91, τ=7 safe\n\nU to y=6 t=92\n\nU to y=7 t=93\n\nU to y=8 t=94\n\nU to y=9 t=95\n\nSame as before, but I spent more stays: at t=85 S, t=86 S, and then from y=1 to y=2 at t=88, etc., so I reached later? From t=90 y=4 to t=95 y=9, 5 turns, but I started later.\n\nt=84: y=0, action U, y_{85}=1\n\nt=85: y=1, action S, y_{86}=1\n\nt=86: y=1, action S, y_{87}=1? If I choose S again.\n\nt=86: y=1, action S, y_{87}=1\n\nt=87: y=1, action U, y_{88}=2\n\nt=88: y=2, action U, y_{89}=3\n\nt=89: y=3, action U, y_{90}=4\n\nThen same as before, t=90 y=4, etc., to t=95 y=9.\n\nBut I have three S actions: at t=85,86,87? t=85 S, t=86 S, t=87 U, so two S and then U.\n\nCompared to first path: first path had S at t=87 and t=88, then from t=89 U to t=90 y=4.\n\nIn first path, y=4 at t=90.\n\nHere, y=4 at t=90 same.\n\nBut I used actions: in this, from t=84 U, t=85 S, t=86 S, t=87 U, t=88 U, t=89 U to y=4 at t=90.\n\nThen same up.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at t=95 still, but I have two S early instead of later, but same number of actions: 11 actions to reach at t=95.\n\nIn first path: actions a84 U, a85 U, a86 U, a87 S, a88 S, a89 U, a90 U, ..., a94 U to y95=9.\n\na94 U to y95=9.\n\nActions: a84 to a94, 11 actions.\n\nIn this alternative: a84 U to y85=1, a85 S to y86=1, a86 S to y87=1? a86 S, y87=1, a87 U to y88=2, a88 U to y89=3, a89 U to y90=4, then a90 U to y91=5, ..., a94 U to y95=9. Same actions from a90, but from a84 to a94, still 11 actions.\n\na89 U to y90=4, then a90 U to y91=5, ..., a94 U to y95=9. So actions a84 to a94, 11 actions.\n\nBut in this case, I have S at t=85 and t=86, whereas in first, S at t=87 and t=88.\n\nBut same H=11.\n\nNow, back to the later dangers? For example, y=4 dangerous at τ=12,13,14, t=96,97,98.\n\nBut in the path, at t=96, I am at y=9 if I stay, but I reached at t=95, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have later dangers, but I am not on them.\n\nSo H=11 seems achievable.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at t=94.\n\nThat means at t=94, y=9.\n\nWhich means I must have been at y=8 at t=93, and chose U.\n\nAt t=93, y=8, which requires at t=92 y=7, and so on.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=94, I need to be at y=8 at t=93, y=7 at t=92, ..., down to y=0 at t=84.\n\nThe positions:\n\nt=84: y=0\n\nt=85: y=a or b\n\nSince I go up, likely y_t = t - 84 for early, but with modifications.\n\nSet y_t at time t.\n\nt=84: y=0\n\nt=85: y= something\n\n...\n\nt=94: y=9\n\nNow, from t=84 to t=94, 10 steps? t=84 to t=94 is 11 time points, but actions from t=84 to t=93, 10 actions.\n\nAfter 10 actions, position at t=94.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 at t=94 with 10 actions.\n\nThen y_t must increase from 0 to 9 in 10 steps, so net +9, so I need 9 up and 1 other action, which could be S or D.\n\nBut S or D would mean I stay or go down, so to compensate, I need to go up faster elsewhere, but since I start from 0, I can only go up to 1 at t=85, etc., min y_t at t is min(t-84, something).\n\nAt t=84, y=0\n\nAfter first action, t=85, y<=1\n\nAfter second, t=86, y<=2, etc.\n\nAfter k actions, at t=84+k, y <= k\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=94, which is after 10 actions (t=84+10=94), so y<=10, but y=9 possible.\n\nNow, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nSpecifically, at t=88 (τ=4), I must not be on y=4 to 8.\n\ny=4 to 8 dangerous at t=88.\n\nt=88 is τ=4.\n\nNow, t=88 is between t=84 and t=94.\n\nAt t=88, I must be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 at t=94, so at t=88, I might not be at y=9.\n\ny at t=88 must be <=3 or 9, but since y=9 is far, likely <=3.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be on y=4 at some point, but not at t=87,88,89 because dangerous for y=4.\n\nt=87,88,89 are τ=3,4,5.\n\nNow, possible y at t=88: since t=88, after 4 actions from start? t=84 +4 = t=88.\n\nAfter 4 actions, position at t=88.\n\ny at t=88 can be from 0 to 4.\n\nBut must be <=3 to be safe.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 at t=94, I need to go up 9 times in 10 actions, so one S or D.\n\nNow, suppose I am at y=3 at t=88.\n\nThen from t=88 to t=94, 6 turns to go to y=9, which needs 6 up moves, but y from 3 to 9, need +6, so possible with 6 U.\n\nBut at t=88, y=3.\n\nHow to be at y=3 at t=88.\n\nFrom t=84, y=0, to t=88, y=3.\n\nIn 4 actions: from t=84 to t=88, actions at t=84,85,86,87 determine y at t=88.\n\ny_{88} = y_{87} + Δy_{87}\n\nBut y_{87} depends on previous.\n\nThe position y_t at time t.\n\ny_{88} = y_{84} + sum of Δy from t=84 to t=87.\n\ny_{84} =0, so y_{88} = sum_{i=84}^{87} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, 0.\n\ny_{88} = number of U minus number of D from t=84 to t=87, since start from 0.\n\nActions from t=84 to t=87 inclusive? Actions a_t affect y_{t+1}.\n\na_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t effect.\n\ny_{85} = y_{84} + Δy_{84}\n\ny_{86} = y_{85} + Δy_{85} = y_{84} + Δy_{84} + Δy_{85}\n\n...\n\ny_{88} = y_{84} + Δy_{84} + Δy_{85} + Δy_{86} + Δy_{87}\n\ny_{84} =0, so y_{88} = sum_{k=84}^{87} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy_k = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S.\n\nSimilarly, y_{88} must be 3 for example.\n\nBut y_{88} can be less.\n\nTo have y_{88} =3, I need net +3 in four actions, so for example, three U and one S, or other combinations.\n\nBut I also need to avoid being on y=4 at t=87,88,89.\n\nt=87: if I am on y=4 at t=87, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly t=88 and t=89.\n\nNow, at t=87, y must not be 4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=88, y must not be 4-8.\n\nAt t=89, y must not be 4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at t=87,88,89.\n\nAlso, y=5-8 dangerous only at t=88.\n\nNow, suppose for t=94 y=9.\n\nThen y_{94} =9.\n\ny_{94} = y_{84} + sum_{k=84}^{93} Δy_k = 0 + sum =9\n\n10 actions, sum of Δy =9, so number of U minus number of D =9, since S contributes 0.\n\nSince y in [0,9], and we start at 0, end at 9, with 10 actions, net +9, so must have 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U but y cannot exceed, but with 10 U, y would be 10 at t=94, but y=10 not allowed, since y<=9, so if I try to go above, it clamps, but to reach y=9, I need exactly 9 U and 1 other action, which must be S, since D would decrease net.\n\nSo 9 U and 1 S in 10 actions.\n\nNow, the S must be placed somewhere.\n\nNow, positions: at t=88, y_{88} must be <=3.\n\ny_{88} = sum_{k=84}^{87} Δy_k\n\nSince y_{84}=0.\n\nThe sum has 4 terms: Δy_{84} to Δy_{87}\n\ny_{88} = Δy_{84} + Δy_{85} + Δy_{86} + Δy_{87}  (since y_{84}=0)\n\nEach +1,0,-1.\n\ny_{88} <=3.\n\nBut since we have only one S, most Δy are +1.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=94 with 10 actions, including one S.\n\nNow, at t=88, which is after 4 actions, y_{88} <=3.\n\nBut with actions, if all U, y_{88} would be 4, but we need <=3, so the S must be before or at t=87 to reduce y.\n\ny_{88} = number of U minus number of D from the first four actions.\n\nSince we have one S and the rest U, for the first four actions, if I have three U and one S, y_{88}=3.\n\nIf I have two U, one D, one S, y_{88}=1, etc.\n\nBut to minimize time, probably have y_{88}=3.\n\nNow, also, at t=87, y_{87} must not be 4.\n\ny_{87} = y_{84} + Δy_{84} + Δy_{85} + Δy_{86} = Δy_{84} + Δy_{85} + Δy_{86}  (since y_{84}=0)\n\nIf y_{88}=3, then y_{88} = y_{87} + Δy_{87}\n\nIf y_{88}=3, and y_{87} could be 3 or 4 or 2, etc.\n\nBut if y_{87}=4, then at t=87, y=4, dangerous.\n\nSo we need y_{87} !=4.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{87}=3, and Δy_{87}=0, then y_{88}=3.\n\nIf y_{87}=3, Δy_{87}=U, y_{88}=4, but we want y_{88}<=3, so if y_{87}=3, must have Δy_{87}= S or D, but S would keep y=3, D to y=2.\n\nBut we need y_{88}<=3, so possible.\n\nNow, case: suppose y_{88}=3.\n\nThen y_{87} + Δy_{87} =3.\n\nIf y_{87}=4, then Δy_{87} must be D, so y_{88}=3.\n\nBut if y_{87}=4, at t=87, collision.\n\nSo y_{87} cannot be 4.\n\nTherefore, y_{87} must be <=3.\n\nIf y_{87} <=2, then with Δy_{87}, y_{88} could be less than 3, but we can have y_{88}=3 if y_{87}=3 and Δy_{87}=S, or y_{87}=2 and Δy_{87}=U, etc.\n\nBut to have y_{88}=3, with y_{87} !=4.\n\nSo possible if y_{87}=3 and Δy_{87}=S, then y_{88}=3.\n\nOr y_{87}=2 and Δy_{87}=U, y_{88}=3.\n\nOr y_{87}=3 and Δy_{87}=D, y_{88}=2, but then y_{88}=2<3.\n\nBut we want y_{88}<=3, not necessarily 3.\n\nNow, back to the sequence to t=94.\n\nSuppose at t=87, y=3, and we choose S, so y_{88}=3.\n\nThen at t=88, y=3, we need to choose action.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=94, we need from t=88 to t=94, 6 turns, y from 3 to 9, need +6, so all U.\n\nActions: a_{88} to a_{93}, 6 actions, all U, y_{94}=9.\n\nNow, but at t=88, y=3, choose U, then y_{89}=4.\n\nt=89: y=4, but τ=5, t=89, τ=5, dangerous for y=4! Collision.\n\nIf choose S at t=88, y_{89}=3.\n\nThen t=89: y=3, choose U, y_{90}=4.\n\nThen y_{90}=4, τ=6, safe.\n\nThen from there, y=4 at t=90, then U to y=5 at t=91, ..., but to y=9 at t=94? t=90 y=4, t=91 y=5, t=92 y=6, t=93 y=7, t=94 y=8, not 9.\n\ny_{94}=8 if I start from y_{90}=4 with U each.\n\ny_{90}=4, a_{90} U, y_{91}=5, a_{91} U, y_{92}=6, a_{92} U, y_{93}=7, a_{93} U, y_{94}=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=94, I need y_{93}=8, and a_{93}=U.\n\nBut from above, at t=90, I am at y=4, then to y=8 at t=94? t=90 y=4, t=91 y=5, t=92 y=6, t=93 y=7, t=94 y=8, not enough.\n\nt=90 to t=94 is 4 actions, to go from y=4 to y=8? y_{91}=5, y_{92}=6, y_{93}=7, y_{94}=8, so y=8 at t=94.\n\nBut I need y=9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=94 from y=4 at t=90 with 4 actions; I can only reach y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=94, I need to be at y=8 at t=93.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=92, etc.\n\nIn particular, at t=90, I need to be at least at y=5 to reach y=9 at t=94: t=90 y=5, t=91 y=6, t=92 y=7, t=93 y=8, t=94 y=9.\n\nSimilarly, earlier.\n\nBut in the critical period, to avoid t=89, I have to be on y<=3 until t=89.\n\nt=89: y must not be 4, so y<=3 or >=5 but not possible, so y<=3.\n\nSimilarly, at t=88, y<=3.\n\nAt t=87, y must not be 4, so y!=4.\n\nNow, for y=9 at t=94.\n\nThen y_{93} must be 8.\n\ny_{92} must be 7 or 8, but with U, etc.\n\nThe position at t=89 must be y<=3.\n\nThen from t=89 to t=94, 5 turns to go from y<=3 to y=9.\n\nNeed +6 in 5 actions, so must have all U and no S or D, but +6 in 5 actions requires at least one U extra, but since y<=9, possible if start from y=3, then to y=9 in 6 steps? From t=89 to t=94.\n\ny_{89} <=3\n\ny_{90} = y_{89} + Δy_{89}\n\n...\n\ny_{94} = y_{89} + Δy_{89} + Δy_{90} + Δy_{91} + Δy_{92} + Δy_{93} =9\n\nSince y_{89} <=3, let s = y_{89}, s<=3\n\nThen sum of 5 Δy = 9 - s >=6\n\nSo I need at least 6 net up in 5 actions, which is impossible since each action at most +1, so maximum net +5 in 5 actions.\n\nThus, if s=3, max y_{94} = 3 + 5 =8\n\nIf s=2, max 7, etc.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=94 if y_{89} <=3.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach at t=94 with y=9.\n\nSimilarly, for any earlier, worse.\n\nThus, minimal to reach at t=95 with y=9, after 11 actions.\n\nH=11 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, we have the actions.\n\nNow, in the first path, we have:\n\nt=84: action U\n\nt=85: U\n\nt=86: U\n\nt=87: S\n\nt=88: S\n\nt=89: U\n\nt=90: U\n\nt=91: U\n\nt=92: U\n\nt=93: U\n\nt=94: U\n\nThen position at t=95: y=9\n\nIn the actions, a_{t} for t=84 to t=94.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the actions starting from t_1=84.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: S\n\nTurn 88: S\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 95.\n\nBut the sequence should be until the action that reaches, I think.\n\nIn the task, \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: after actions, position at next turn.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nWe reach when position is (0,9) at some turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn 95, position (0,9).\n\nt_1 + H = 84 + H =95, so H=11.\n\nThe actions from t=84 to t=94, which are t_1 to t_1 + H -1? t_1=84, t_1 + H -1 =84 +11 -1=94.\n\nYes, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{84} to a_{94}.\n\nAnd position at t_1 + H =95.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for freeway 4, we also have dangerous at t=96,97,98, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the path, when we go to y=4 at t=90, τ=6, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=91, τ=7, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in freeway 4, there is a third car at (24,13,right,4), but it never covers 0, so fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: S\n\nTurn 88: S\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nAnd that's 11 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 5, etc., but we are fine.\n\nPerhaps I can start with S or something, but no benefit.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 84\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H = 11\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The actions ensure that the player is not on a dangerous freeway at any turn when cars cover \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Dangerous Times for Freeways:\n- Freeway 1: Dangerous at turns 100, 101, 102, 103 (\\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)).\n- Freeway 2: Dangerous at turns 100, 101, 102, 103 (\\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)).\n- Freeway 3: Dangerous at turns 100, 101, 102, 103 (\\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)).\n- Freeway 4: Dangerous at turns 87, 88, 89 (\\(\\tau = 3, 4, 5\\)) and 96, 97, 98 (\\(\\tau = 12, 13, 14\\)).\n- Freeway 5: Dangerous only at turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- Freeway 6: Dangerous only at turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- Freeway 7: Dangerous only at turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n- Freeway 8: Dangerous only at turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)).\n\nAt turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), freeways \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous, so the player must be on \\(y \\leq 3\\) or \\(y = 9\\) to avoid collision. Since \\(y = 9\\) is not reachable by turn 88, the player must be on \\(y = 1, 2,\\) or \\(3\\) at this turn. Additionally, freeway \\(y = 4\\) is dangerous at turns 87, 88, and 89, so the player must avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) during these turns.\n\n### Strategy:\n- From turn 84 to 86, move up to reach \\(y = 3\\) by turn 87.\n- At turn 87, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 3\\), avoiding moving to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 88 (which is dangerous).\n- At turn 88, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 3\\), safe since \\(y = 3\\) is not dangerous at \\(\\tau = 4\\).\n- From turn 89 onwards, move up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 95.\n\nThis sequence uses 11 actions (\\(H = 11\\)) and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 95.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=84}^{94}\\) is:\n\n- Turn 84: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 85)\n- Turn 85: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 86)\n- Turn 86: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 87)\n- Turn 87: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 88; avoids danger at \\(y = 4\\) on turn 88)\n- Turn 88: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 89; safe at \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 89: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 90; \\(\\tau = 6\\), safe for freeway 4)\n- Turn 90: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 91; \\(\\tau = 7\\), safe for freeway 5)\n- Turn 91: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 92; \\(\\tau = 8\\), safe for freeway 6)\n- Turn 92: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 93; \\(\\tau = 9\\), safe for freeway 7)\n- Turn 93: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 94; \\(\\tau = 10\\), safe for freeway 8)\n- Turn 94: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 95; goal reached)\n\nPosition at turn 95: \\((0, 9)\\), no collision occurs at any turn.\n\n### Why \\(H = 11\\) is Minimal:\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 9 up actions.\n- At turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), the player must be on \\(y \\leq 3\\) to avoid collision, as \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous.\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is dangerous at turns 87, 88, and 89, so the player cannot be on \\(y = 4\\) during these turns.\n- To satisfy both constraints, two stay actions are needed (at turns 87 and 88) to remain at \\(y = 3\\), resulting in 9 up actions and 2 stay actions (total \\(H = 11\\)).\n- Attempts to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., \\(H = 10\\)) are impossible, as the net movement required (+9 in y) cannot be achieved while avoiding the dangerous turns at \\(\\tau = 4\\) and the constraints on \\(y = 4\\).\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns is 11, with the sequence above.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 88, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). \n\nThe player moves vertically: \n  U: y increases by 1 (if not at 9)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (if not at 0)\n  S: stay at same y.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway that covers the x-coordinate 0 (i.e., 0 is in the car's span at turn T).\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T for the entire turn T. So, at turn T, we check the freeway y_T for cars. Only when we are at a freeway at a given turn do we need to worry about cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nGoal: Minimize the number of turns H to get to y=9.\n\nCurrent state at turn t1=88:\n  Player at y=3.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and the car positions at each future turn relative to t1=88. Let τ = T - t1 be the number of turns after t1.\n\nSo, at time T = t1 + τ, the car positions are computed as:\n\nFor a car given at t1 with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n  If left-moving (but note: in the car update, left-moving is defined as moving to the left, meaning the head is at h and tail at τ, and then the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n  However, in the table, we have both left and right. But note the provided cars are all right-moving? Let's see:\n\nAll the cars in the table are labeled as \"right\", so they are moving to the right.\n\nFor a right-moving car:\n  At t1: the span is [τ, h] (note: the table gives (head, tail) but the update rule says for right-moving: [τ, h] meaning from tail to head? Actually, the update rule says: \n      \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, the representation is: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nFor example, on freeway 4: \n  Car1: (-36, -47, right, 4) -> but note: if the car is moving right, then the head should be the front, which is the larger coordinate? But here, head=-36 and tail=-47. Since -36 > -47, so the head is at -36 and tail at -47. Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. Then at time T, it becomes [-47 + 4*(T-88), -36 + 4*(T-88)].\n\nSimilarly, car2 on freeway4: (4, -7, right, 4) -> span at t1: [-7, 4]. Then at T: [-7+4*(T-88), 4+4*(T-88)].\nCar3: (40,29,right,4) -> [29,40] -> [29+4*(T-88), 40+4*(T-88)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, the player is on freeway y (if y in [1,8]) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn t1=88 (τ=0) at y=3.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn when there is a car on that freeway that covers 0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns required if there were no cars would be 6 (from 3 to 9: 6 moves up). But we have to avoid the freeways when cars are present at 0.\n\nLet's compute the car positions for each freeway at the turns we might be passing through.\n\nWe are going to consider the next few turns (τ=0,1,2,...) and see when we can move without collision.\n\nPlan: We want to go up as fast as possible, but we might have to wait (stay at a safe y) or even go down to avoid a collision? However, going down would be away from the goal. So we should prefer going up or staying.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway we step on at each turn.\n\nThe freeways we care about: we start at y=3 at turn t1=88. Then we will be at y=3 at τ=0, then if we move up, at τ=1 we are at y=4, then y=5, etc.\n\nBut note: if we are at y=3 at τ=0, then we are on freeway 3? Actually, freeways are for y=1 to 8, and we are at y=3 so freeway 3. Then we must check freeway 3 at turn T=88 (τ=0).\n\nSimilarly, when we move to y=4 at τ=1, we are at freeway 4 at turn T=89 (τ=1).\n\nSo we must compute for each freeway and for each τ (relative to t1) the positions of the cars and see if 0 is in their span.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway and for τ from 0 up to, say, 20 (to be safe) the presence of a car at 0.\n\nBut note: the cars move at constant speed and we know their positions at τ=0 (t1=88). We can compute the span at τ = t (where t is the number of turns after t1).\n\nWe note that the player can only be at one freeway per turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving upward (using U) and see if we get stuck. But we might have to use S or even D to avoid a collision? However, D would take us away from the goal and increase H, so we should avoid unless necessary. Similarly, waiting (S) might be necessary.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as much as possible and when we see a collision at a future step, we might wait (S) until the car passes.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving to the right. So the spans are shifting to the right. Therefore, a car that is currently to the left of 0 will eventually pass 0 and then move to the right. Similarly, a car that is to the right of 0 might have already passed 0? But we are at t1=88, so we need to see the positions at that turn and then at future turns.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times (τ) at which a car is covering 0.\n\nWe'll do this for freeways 3 to 8 (since we start at 3 and go up to 9, so we might step on 3,4,5,6,7,8).\n\nFreeway 3: \n  Cars: [ (-36, -47, right, 3) ] -> at τ=0: span = [-47, -36]? \n      Actually, the representation in the table is (head, tail). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36] at τ=0.\n  Then at τ: span = [-47 + 3*τ, -36 + 3*τ]\n\n  We require 0 to be in [-47+3τ, -36+3τ]? \n      -47+3τ <= 0 <= -36+3τ\n      => 3τ >= 47? -> τ >= ceil(47/3)=15.666 -> τ>=16\n      and 3τ <= 36 -> τ<=12? \n      Actually: \n        Lower bound: -47+3τ <=0 -> 3τ<=47 -> τ<=15.666 -> τ<=15 (so that the span is still left of 0 at τ=15? but we need 0 in the interval, so we need the lower bound <=0 and the upper bound>=0.\n\n      -47+3τ <=0 -> τ<=15.666 -> so τ from 0 to 15: the car is still left of 0? \n      -36+3τ>=0 -> τ>=12.\n\n      So τ from 12 to 15 inclusive: \n          τ=12: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included (at the upper bound)\n          τ=13: [-47+39, -36+39] = [-8,3] -> 0 in the interval? yes, because -8<=0<=3.\n          τ=14: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> yes.\n          τ=15: [-47+45, -36+45] = [-2,9] -> yes.\n          τ=16: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n      So freeway 3 has a car at 0 for τ=12,13,14,15 (which correspond to turns 88+12=100, 101,102,103).\n\nBut wait, we are at τ=0 (turn 88) and we are at freeway 3. We must check freeway 3 at τ=0: \n  span at τ=0: [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in this interval. So we are safe at τ=0 on freeway 3.\n\nNow, freeway 4: \n  Cars: \n    Car1: (-32,-43,right,4) -> span at τ=0: [-43, -32] -> at τ: [-43+4τ, -32+4τ]\n    Car2: (4,-7,right,4) -> span at τ=0: [-7,4] -> at τ: [-7+4τ, 4+4τ]\n    Car3: (40,29,right,4) -> span at τ=0: [29,40] -> at τ: [29+4τ,40+4τ]\n\n  Check when 0 is in the span of any of these.\n\n  Car1: \n      -43+4τ <=0 and -32+4τ>=0 -> \n        4τ<=43 -> τ<=10.75 -> τ<=10\n        4τ>=32 -> τ>=8\n      So τ=8,9,10: \n        τ=8: [-43+32, -32+32] = [-11,0] -> 0 included (at the end)\n        τ=9: [-43+36, -32+36] = [-7,4] -> 0 included\n        τ=10: [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8] -> 0 included\n        τ=11: [-43+44, -32+44] = [1,12] -> no.\n\n  Car2:\n      -7+4τ <=0 and 4+4τ>=0 -> \n        -7+4τ<=0 -> 4τ<=7 -> τ<=1.75 -> τ<=1\n        and 4+4τ>=0 -> always true for τ>=0.\n      So τ=0: [-7,4] -> 0 is included? \n          τ=0: the car is at [-7,4] at τ=0 -> 0 is in the interval? yes.\n      τ=1: [-7+4,4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 included? yes.\n      τ=2: [1,12] -> no.\n\n      So Car2 covers 0 at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\n  Car3: \n      [29+4τ,40+4τ] -> the smallest is 29 at τ=0, so 0 is never in the interval.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 4 has:\n      τ=0: covered by Car2 -> unsafe\n      τ=1: covered by Car2 -> unsafe\n      τ=2: safe? because Car2 is gone and Car1 hasn't reached 0 yet? \n      τ=8,9,10: unsafe (Car1)\n\n  So freeway 4 is unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9,10.\n\nFreeway 5:\n  Cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n  Car1: (0,-11,right,12) -> span at τ=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, at τ=0.\n        Then at τ: [-11+12τ, 0+12τ] = [-11+12τ, 12τ]\n        We require 0 in the interval: \n            -11+12τ <=0 and 12τ>=0 -> \n            -11+12τ<=0 -> τ<=11/12 -> τ=0 only? because at τ=0: [-11,0] -> 0 included.\n            at τ=1: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n        So only τ=0.\n\n  Car2: (48,37,right,12) -> span at τ=0: [37,48] -> always positive, so 0 never in.\n\n  Therefore, freeway5 is unsafe at τ=0 only.\n\nFreeway 6:\n  Same as freeway5: unsafe at τ=0 only.\n\nFreeway7:\n  Same: unsafe at τ=0.\n\nFreeway8:\n  Same: unsafe at τ=0.\n\nBut note: we are at τ=0 (turn 88) and we are at y=3 (freeway3) which is safe. We are not on freeway4,5,6,7,8 at τ=0.\n\nNow, we need to plan the moves:\n\nWe start at y=3, τ=0 (turn88). We are safe at freeway3 at τ=0.\n\nOur goal: get to y=9. We have to go through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe must avoid:\n  freeway4 at τ=0 and τ=1 and τ=8,9,10 -> so if we are at freeway4 at τ=0 or τ=1 or τ=8,9,10, we will collide.\n\n  freeway5,6,7,8 at τ=0: only unsafe at τ=0? But we are not at τ=0 for these freeways because we start at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nBut note: if we move to y=4 at τ=1 (i.e., at turn89, τ=1), then we are at freeway4 at τ=1 -> unsafe! So we cannot move to freeway4 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at freeway5 at τ=0? But we are at y=3 at τ=0, so we are not at freeway5. But when we get to freeway5, what τ will that be? \n\nLet me denote the turn index relative to t1: τ = 0,1,2,...\n\nAt τ=0: y=3 (safe at freeway3)\n\nWe want to move up to y=4 at τ=1? But then we are at freeway4 at τ=1 -> unsafe (because freeway4 at τ=1 is unsafe). So we cannot do U at τ=0.\n\nAlternative: we can do S at τ=0: then at τ=1 we are still at y=3.\n\nOr D: but that would go to y=2, which is freeway2? But we are not given any car on freeway2? Wait, the table has freeways 1 to 8. Freeway2 has a car: (-36,-47,right,3). But we are at τ=0 at freeway2? We are at y=3, not y=2. So if we go down to y=2 at τ=1, we would be at freeway2 at τ=1.\n\nWe need to check freeway2 at τ=1? \n  Freeway2: car (-36,-47,right,3) -> span at τ=1: [-47+3*1, -36+3*1] = [-44, -33] -> 0 not in. So safe.\n\nBut going down to y=2 at τ=1 is moving away from the goal. We might avoid that.\n\nSo options at τ=0:\n  U: would lead to y=4 at τ=1 -> unsafe (freeway4 at τ=1 is unsafe) -> not allowed.\n  D: leads to y=2 at τ=1 -> safe (freeway2 at τ=1 is safe) -> but then we are at y=2 and we have to come back up, which will take extra moves.\n  S: stay at y=3 at τ=1 -> then we are at freeway3 at τ=1: we need to check freeway3 at τ=1.\n\nFreeway3 at τ=1: \n  Car: [-47+3*1, -36+3*1] = [-44, -33] -> 0 not in. So safe.\n\nSo at τ=0, we can do S or D. But D is worse. So we choose S at τ=0.\n\nThen at τ=1: y=3 (freeway3) and safe.\n\nNow τ=1: we are at y=3. We can try to move up to y=4 at τ=2? \n  Then we would be at freeway4 at τ=2.\n\nFreeway4 at τ=2: \n  We saw that freeway4 is unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9,10 -> safe at τ=2? \n      Car2: at τ=2: [-7+4*2, 4+4*2] = [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe for Car2.\n      Car1: at τ=2: [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n      Car3: safe anyway.\n  So freeway4 at τ=2 is safe.\n\nTherefore, at τ=1 (turn89) we can do U to go to y=4 at τ=2 (turn90).\n\nSo now:\n  τ=0 (turn88): S\n  τ=1 (turn89): U -> then at τ=2 (turn90): y=4 (freeway4) and safe.\n\nNow at τ=2 (turn90): we are at y=4. We want to move to y=5? Then at τ=3 we would be at freeway5.\n\nWe need to check freeway5 at τ=3: \n  Freeway5: unsafe only at τ=0? \n      At τ=3: \n        Car1: (0,-11,right,12) -> at τ=3: [-11+12*3, 0+12*3] = [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        Car2: [37+36,48+36] = [73,84] -> safe.\n      So freeway5 at τ=3 is safe.\n\nSo we can do U at τ=2: then at τ=3: y=5.\n\nNow at τ=3 (turn91): y=5. We want to move to y=6? Then at τ=4: freeway6.\n\nFreeway6: unsafe at τ=0? \n  At τ=4: \n      Car1: [-11+12*4, 0+12*4] = [37,48] -> safe.\n      Car2: [37+48,48+48]? Wait, the car at freeway6: same as freeway5? \n        Actually, freeway6 has the same cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12) -> note: the second car is (48,37) so span [37,48] at τ=0? \n        Then at τ=4: [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n        And the first car: [-11+48, 0+48] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway6 at τ=4 is safe.\n\nSo we do U at τ=3: then at τ=4: y=6.\n\nNow at τ=4 (turn92): y=6. We want to move to y=7? Then at τ=5: freeway7.\n\nFreeway7: unsafe at τ=0? \n  At τ=5: \n      Car1: [-11+12*5, 0+12*5] = [49,60] -> safe.\n      Car2: [37+60,48+60] = [97,108] -> safe.\n  So safe.\n\nSo we do U at τ=4: then at τ=5: y=7.\n\nNow at τ=5 (turn93): y=7. We want to move to y=8? Then at τ=6: freeway8.\n\nFreeway8: unsafe at τ=0? \n  At τ=6: \n      Car1: [-11+12*6, 0+12*6] = [61,72] -> safe.\n      Car2: [37+72,48+72] = [109,120] -> safe.\n  So safe.\n\nSo we do U at τ=5: then at τ=6: y=8.\n\nNow at τ=6 (turn94): y=8. We want to move to y=9? Then at τ=7: we are at y=9 -> and y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no car check. We are safe.\n\nBut we are at y=8 at τ=6. We can do U at τ=6 to go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut wait: we need to check if we are at freeway8 at τ=6? Yes, at τ=6 we are at freeway8 and we just checked it is safe. Then we move to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn 88: S\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U (to y=5? wait, let me recount)\n\nActually, step-by-step:\n\nτ=0 (turn88): start at y=3 -> S -> stay at y=3.\nτ=1 (turn89): at y=3 -> U -> to y=4 at τ=2? \n  Correction: the update is: at turn τ (relative to t1) we take an action that affects the next state.\n  Specifically: \n      At turn T = t1 + τ, we are at y_τ (for τ>=0, at τ=0 we start at y0=3).\n      We choose a_τ (action at T) and then we get y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\n  So:\n      τ=0 (T=88): we are at y0=3. We do S -> then y1 = 3 (for τ=1, i.e., T=89).\n      τ=1 (T=89): we are at y1=3. We do U -> then y2 = 3+1 = 4 (at τ=2, T=90).\n      τ=2 (T=90): we are at y2=4. We do U -> then y3 = 4+1 = 5 (at τ=3, T=91).\n      τ=3 (T=91): we are at y3=5. We do U -> then y4 = 5+1 = 6 (at τ=4, T=92).\n      τ=4 (T=92): we are at y4=6. We do U -> then y5 = 6+1 = 7 (at τ=5, T=93).\n      τ=5 (T=93): we are at y5=7. We do U -> then y6 = 7+1 = 8 (at τ=6, T=94).\n      τ=6 (T=94): we are at y6=8. We do U -> then y7 = 8+1 = 9 (at τ=7, T=95).\n\nSo we reach y=9 at τ=7 (turn95). \n\nBut we must check the freeways we were on at each turn:\n\n  τ=0 (T=88): y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as computed)\n  τ=1 (T=89): y=3 -> freeway3: safe (at τ=1: freeway3 span is [-44,-33] -> safe)\n  τ=2 (T=90): y=4 -> freeway4: at τ=2: safe (as above)\n  τ=3 (T=91): y=5 -> freeway5: at τ=3: safe\n  τ=4 (T=92): y=6 -> freeway6: at τ=4: safe\n  τ=5 (T=93): y=7 -> freeway7: at τ=5: safe\n  τ=6 (T=94): y=8 -> freeway8: at τ=6: safe\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut wait: we were at freeway5 at τ=3? And freeway5 was unsafe only at τ=0? Yes, so safe.\n\nHowever, we must also note that we are moving through the freeways and we are only at one freeway per turn.\n\nBut is there any other car we haven't considered? For example, freeway1 and 2? We never step on them? We started at 3 and went up. So we don't step on freeway1 or 2.\n\nBut what about freeway3? We were there at τ=0 and τ=1, and then we left. We are safe at those times.\n\nSo the sequence of actions for turns 88 to 94 (7 turns) is:\n\nTurn 88: S\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\n\nThen at turn95 we are at y=9? But note: we are at y=8 at turn94 and we do U at turn94 to go to y=9 at the next state (turn95). However, we are required to have the last action that lands us at y=9 at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe problem says: we start at turn t1=88, and we are to give a sequence of actions for t=t1, t1+1, ... until the turn when we land at y=9. The landing happens at the next state after the last action.\n\nSo the last action we take is at turn94 (which is t1+6) and then we are at y=9 at turn95 (t1+7). So we have taken 7 actions (from τ=0 to τ=6) and H=7 turns? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and H is the number of turns (actions). So we have H=7 actions? But we start at τ=0 and end at τ=6 (7 actions) and we reach y9 at the state after the 7th action, i.e., at τ=7.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from 3 to 9 is 6 moves up. But we had to wait one turn at the beginning. So total 7 moves.\n\nBut is there a faster way? Without the wait? \n\nWe saw that at τ=0 we cannot move up because that would put us at freeway4 at τ=1 which is unsafe. What if we try to move up at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1? That is unsafe. So we must avoid that.\n\nWhat if we do a down move? Then we go to y=2 at τ=1. Then we could try to go back up? But that would take at least 2 extra moves (down then up) and then we still have to go up 6 moves: total 8 moves? which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at y=3 for one turn (as we did) and then proceed. So 7 moves is the minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can go faster by avoiding the wait at the beginning? \n\nWe cannot avoid the wait because we cannot go to freeway4 at τ=1. And we cannot skip freeway4? We must go through 4 to get to 5.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go up to y=4 at a later time? For example, wait until τ=2 to be at freeway4? \n\nBut at τ=0: we are at y=3. If we do nothing at τ=0 (S) then at τ=1 we are still at y=3. Then at τ=1 we do U to go to y=4 at τ=2. That's what we did.\n\nIf we try to go up at τ=0: unsafe because then we are at freeway4 at τ=1 (unsafe).\n\nWhat if we go down to y=2 at τ=1? Then at τ=1 we are at freeway2: which is safe. Then at τ=1 we can do U to go to y=3 at τ=2. Then at τ=2 we are at freeway3: which is safe (at τ=2: freeway3 car at [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> safe). Then at τ=2 we can do U to go to y=4 at τ=3. Then we are at freeway4 at τ=3: we need to check.\n\nFreeway4 at τ=3: \n  Car1: [-43+12, -32+12] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-7+12,4+12] = [5,16] -> safe.\n  So safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 at τ=3. Then we have to go to y=5 at τ=4, then y=6 at τ=5, y=7 at τ=6, y=8 at τ=7, y=9 at τ=8. That's 8 moves? \n\nCompared to our first plan which took 7 moves. So worse.\n\nSo our first plan is better.\n\nBut wait, in the first plan we reached y=9 at τ=7 (after 7 actions). So H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 6? \n\nWe need to go from 3 to 9: 6 moves up. But we cannot do the first move (at τ=0) because that would put us at freeway4 at τ=1 which is unsafe. So we must have at least one S or D. But D is worse. So we need at least 7 moves? \n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 88: S\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\n\nBut wait, at τ=6 (turn94) we are at y=8 and we do U to go to y=9 at the next state. And we are done.\n\nBut note: we have to write the actions for turns 88 to 88+6=94. So 7 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So H=7, then t from 0 to 6 (7 actions).\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: S\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway4 at τ=2: \n  τ=2: \n    Car1: [-43+4*2, -32+4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Car2: [-7+4*2, 4+4*2] = [-7+8,4+8] = [1,12] -> safe.\n    Car3: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway3 at τ=0 and τ=1: \n  τ=0: [-47, -36] -> safe.\n  τ=1: [-47+3, -36+3] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\n\nAnd the others are safe as computed.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut note: we were at freeway3 at τ=0 and τ=1. At τ=0 we did S and stayed at freeway3. Then at τ=1 we did U and moved to freeway4 at τ=2. So the freeway3 at τ=1 is when we are still at y=3? Yes.\n\nSo the plan is valid.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) on turn 88. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. After analyzing the car movements and collision conditions, the minimal sequence of actions to reach (0, 9) in 7 turns is as follows:\n\n- At turn 88 (τ=0), the player is at y=3. Freeway 3 is safe (car span [-47, -36] does not contain 0). Moving up to y=4 at τ=1 would place the player on freeway 4 at τ=1, which is unsafe (car span [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3, 8] contains 0). Therefore, the player must stay (S) to remain at y=3 for τ=1.\n- At turn 89 (τ=1), the player is at y=3. Freeway 3 is safe (car span [-47+3, -36+3] = [-44, -33] does not contain 0). Moving up (U) to y=4 at τ=2 is safe (freeway 4 at τ=2: car spans [-43+8, -32+8] = [-35, -24], [-7+8, 4+8] = [1, 12], [29+8, 40+8] = [37, 48] do not contain 0).\n- Subsequent moves upward are safe:\n  - Turn 90 (τ=2): Move to y=5 at τ=3 (freeway 5 at τ=3: car spans [-11+36, 0+36] = [25, 36], [37+36, 48+36] = [73, 84] do not contain 0).\n  - Turn 91 (τ=3): Move to y=6 at τ=4 (freeway 6 at τ=4: car spans [-11+48, 0+48] = [37, 48], [37+48, 48+48] = [85, 96] do not contain 0).\n  - Turn 92 (τ=4): Move to y=7 at τ=5 (freeway 7 at τ=5: car spans [-11+60, 0+60] = [49, 60], [37+60, 48+60] = [97, 108] do not contain 0).\n  - Turn 93 (τ=5): Move to y=8 at τ=6 (freeway 8 at τ=6: car spans [-11+72, 0+72] = [61, 72], [37+72, 48+72] = [109, 120] do not contain 0).\n- At turn 94 (τ=6), the player is at y=8. Moving up (U) to y=9 at τ=7 reaches the goal. Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), no car collision check is needed.\n\nThis sequence requires 7 turns (H=7) and avoids all collisions. Any attempt to reach y=9 in fewer turns (e.g., 6 turns) would require moving up immediately at turn 88, but this results in a collision on freeway 4 at τ=1. Therefore, 7 turns is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 88: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 90: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 91: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 92: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 90, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeway we are on at the exact turn.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is y from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nNote: When moving from one freeway to another, at the moment of the move (turn T), the player is still on the previous freeway. So when we take an action at turn T that changes our y, then at turn T we are on the old y, and at turn T+1 we are on the new y.\n\nWe have to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=4 to y=9. Since we can only move one step at a time (or stay), and we cannot go above 9 or below 0, the minimal number of moves without any cars would be 5 (because 9-4=5, so 5 Ups). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways we step on. Since we start at y=4 and need to go to y=9, we will pass through y=5,6,7,8,9. But note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). The freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nWe are at turn 90. For each freeway and each car on it, we can compute the position of the car at any future turn T (relative to turn 90). The turn T is measured in steps from t1=90. So at turn T (global turn = 90 + t, where t is the step from now, starting at 0 for the current turn), we are at position y_{90+t}.\n\nAt the current turn (t=0, global turn 90): we are at y=4. We are about to choose an action for this turn, which will determine our position at turn 91 (if we move) or stay at 90.\n\nBut note: we are at (0,4) at turn 90. We are on freeway 4? Actually, the freeways are for y=1 to 8. So at y=4, that is freeway 4. However, we are at turn 90 and we are not moving at this exact moment? We are about to take an action.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And collision occurs at turn T only if we are on a freeway k (so y in [1,8]) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that same turn T.\n\nSo at the moment we are at turn 90 and we are at (0,4) (which is freeway 4). We must check if at turn 90, there is a car on freeway 4 that covers 0.\n\nLooking at freeway 4:\n  Cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48,37, right, 4)\n\nFor a right-moving car, the span at time t (from now) is:\n  [tau + s * t, h + s * t]   [because at t=0, the span is [tau, h] and then it moves right by s*t]\n\nBut note: the initial state is given at turn t1=90. So for a car, at global turn 90, we have:\n  For the first car: head = -24, tail = -35? But wait: for right-moving, the head is the front? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning from tail to head? And then it moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for the first car on freeway 4: head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=4.\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost? So if the car is moving right, then the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). However, here head=-24 and tail=-35, so tail=-35 is less than head=-24? That would be a car from -35 to -24? But then the span at turn 90 is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]. And since it's right-moving, at time T (from turn 90) the span becomes [-35 + 4*(T-90), -24 + 4*(T-90)]? Actually, we are at turn 90, so the offset from t1=90 is t = T - 90. So at time t (steps after 90), the car is at:\n  [tau + s*t, h + s*t] = [-35 + 4*t, -24 + 4*t]\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (head=12, tail=1, right, 4) -> at time t: [1+4*t, 12+4*t]\nThird car: (48,37,right,4) -> [37+4*t, 48+4*t]\n\nWe are at freeway 4 at turn 90 (t=0). We need to check if 0 is in any of the spans at t=0.\n\nFirst car: [-35, -24] -> 0 is not in [-35,-24]? (since -35 <= 0 <= -24? but 0 > -24 -> no)\nSecond car: [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] (0<1 -> no)\nThird car: [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 90, we are safe at y=4.\n\nNow, we plan the next moves.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 5 (if we go up 5 times). But we have to avoid collisions at every step.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We are at turn 90: y=4.\n\nWe choose an action for turn 90 (which will affect our position at turn 91).\n\nWe have three choices: U, D, S.\n\nBut D would take us down to y=3 (which is freeway 3) and that might be dangerous? Also, we want to go up. So probably we want to go up. But we have to check the freeways we step on at the exact turn we are on them.\n\nLet me denote the time steps:\n\nAt global turn T = 90 + t, we are at position y(t) (with t=0: y(0)=4).\n\nWe choose actions: a_{90}, a_{91}, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nAt each step t (from 0 to H-1), we are at position y(t) and we choose a_t, then at step t+1 we are at y(t+1) = y(t) + delta, and we must not collide at the freeway we are on at turn 90+t (i.e., at the moment we are at that freeway).\n\nSo for step t (global turn 90+t), we are at freeway y(t) (if y(t) in [1,8]) and we check the cars on that freeway at that global turn.\n\nTo check a car at global turn T = 90+t, we compute the car's span at time t (since the state is given at t1=90, so elapsed time is t).\n\nWe must avoid having 0 in the span of any car on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nNow, let's look at the freeways we will traverse:\n\nWe are at y=4 at t=0 (global 90) -> safe as we checked.\n\nWe need to go to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut note: we might not go straight up? We could go down? But that would increase the steps. So we aim for minimal steps, so we want to go up as much as possible, unless there is a danger that forces us to wait or go down.\n\nWe are going to simulate step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note the car movements:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-30, -41, right, 3) -> at time t: [-41 + 3*t, -30 + 3*t]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [-41+3*t, -30+3*t]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [-41+3*t, -30+3*t]\n\nFreeway 4: \n  car1: [-35+4*t, -24+4*t]\n  car2: [1+4*t, 12+4*t]\n  car3: [37+4*t, 48+4*t]\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: each has two cars:\n  (24,13,right,12): [13+12*t, 24+12*t]\n  (-48,-59,right,12): [-59+12*t, -48+12*t]\n\nNote: the cars on freeway 5,6,7,8 are identical? Yes, same two cars on each.\n\nBut wait, that might be a lot of cars. However, we only care when we are on that freeway.\n\nWe are at y=4 at t=0 (safe). We want to go to y=5. So we take action U at turn 90. Then at turn 91 (t=1) we are at y=5.\n\nBut we must check at turn 90: we are at y=4 (safe) and then we move to y=5 at turn 91. At turn 91, we will be at freeway 5. So we must check freeway 5 at global turn 91 (t=1).\n\nFreeway 5 at t=1:\n\nCar1: [13+12*1, 24+12*1] = [25, 36] -> 0 is not in [25,36]\nCar2: [-59+12*1, -48+12*1] = [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in [-47,-36] (since both negative)\n\nSo safe at y=5 at t=1.\n\nNow, we are at y=5 at t=1. We take action U to go to y=6 at turn 92 (t=2). Then we check freeway 6 at t=2? Actually, at turn 92 (t=2) we are at freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=2:\n\nSame as freeway 5,6,7,8: \n  Car1: [13+12*2, 24+12*2] = [13+24,24+24] = [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n  Car2: [-59+12*2, -48+12*2] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, at y=6 at t=2, we take U to go to y=7 at turn 93 (t=3). Check freeway 7 at t=3:\n\nCar1: [13+12*3, 24+12*3] = [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> 0 not in.\nCar2: [-59+12*3, -48+12*3]=[-59+36, -48+36]=[-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at y=7 at t=3, we take U to go to y=8 at turn 94 (t=4). Check freeway 8 at t=4:\n\nCar1: [13+12*4, 24+12*4]=[13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> safe.\nCar2: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4]=[-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> wait, 0 is included? The span is [-11,0]. Since the car is right-moving and the span includes 0? So at t=4, the car on freeway 8 has a span [-11,0]. So 0 is included -> collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go straight up, we would collide at freeway 8 at turn 94 (t=4).\n\nSo we cannot go to y=8 at turn 94? Because at that turn we are on freeway 8 and the car covers 0.\n\nWhat can we do? We must avoid that collision.\n\nOption 1: Wait at y=7 for one turn? Then go to y=8 at a later turn.\n\nOption 2: Go down? But that would take more steps.\n\nWe are at y=7 at turn 93 (t=3). We could take an action S (stay) at turn 93, then we stay at y=7 for turn 94? But at turn 94 (t=4) we are still at y=7. Then we check freeway 7 at t=4.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=4:\n  Car1: [13+12*4,24+12*4]=[61,72] -> safe\n  Car2: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4]=[-11,0] -> but wait, this car is on freeway 7? Actually, each freeway has its own set of cars? The table says freeway 5,6,7,8 each has two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12). So freeway 7 at t=4: same as above? Then at freeway 7, the second car is at [-11,0] at t=4? So if we are at freeway 7 at t=4, then 0 is included -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at y=7 at turn 94 either.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway 7 or 8 at t=4? Because:\n\nFreeway 7 at t=4: car2: [-11,0] -> collision\nFreeway 8 at t=4: car2: [-11,0] -> collision? Actually, for freeway 8 at t=4 we computed car2 as [-11,0]? But wait, the car on freeway 8 is the same as freeway 7? Yes, the table shows the same two cars for each freeway 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut that means at t=4, every freeway from 5 to 8 has a car that covers 0? Because the cars are identical and move the same.\n\nLet me check freeway 5 at t=4:\n  Car2: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> so yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at t=4: same -> collision.\n\nSo at t=4 (global turn 94), if we are on any freeway from 5 to 8, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 5,6,7,8 at t=4.\n\nBut we are currently at t=0: y=4, then we plan:\n\nt=0 (global 90): y=4 (freeway4) -> safe\nt=1 (global 91): we are at y=5 (freeway5) -> we must check: at t=1, freeway5: \n  car1: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36] -> safe -> so we can be at y=5 at t=1.\n\nBut if we then go to y=6 at t=2 (global92): \n  freeway6 at t=2: \n    car1: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe\n    car2: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=3 (global93): \n  freeway7 at t=3: \n    car1: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe\n    car2: [-59+36, -48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nBut then we cannot be at y=7 at t=4 (global94) because then we collide? But we are at y=7 at t=3 and then we want to move at t=3 (global93) to y=8? But then at global94 we would be at y=8? And at global94 (t=4) we are at y=8 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we could stay at y=7 at t=3 (so we don't move at turn93) but then at global94 we are still at y=7 -> and at t=4, freeway7 has car2 at [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we must not be at y=5,6,7,8 at t=4.\n\nWhat about going down? At t=3, we are at y=7. Instead of staying or going up, we could go down to y=6 at global94? But then at global94 (t=4) we are at freeway6 -> which also has the car at [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=5 at t=4: same.\n\nSo we must be at a freeway not in [5,8] at t=4? But the freeways are 1 to 8. We are at y=7 at t=3. We can only go to y=6,7,8? So we are stuck.\n\nAlternative plan: we slow down earlier.\n\nWe are at t=0: y=4 -> safe.\n\nInstead of going to y=5 at t=1, we could stay at y=4 for one turn? Then at t=1 (global91) we are at y=4. Check freeway4 at t=1:\n\nFreeway4 at t=1:\n  car1: [-35+4*1, -24+4*1] = [-31, -20] -> safe\n  car2: [1+4*1, 12+4*1] = [5,16] -> safe (0 not in [5,16])\n  car3: [37+4,48+4]=[41,52] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at t=1 (global91) we are at y=4. Now we can go to y=5 at t=2 (global92). Then we are at freeway5 at t=2.\n\nFreeway5 at t=2:\n  car1: [13+12*2, 24+12*2]=[37,48] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+12*2, -48+12*2]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=2: we are at y=5. Then we go to y=6 at t=3 (global93): freeway6 at t=3.\n\nFreeway6 at t=3:\n  car1: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=3: y=6. Then we want to go to y=7 at t=4 (global94): freeway7 at t=4 -> but we know at t=4, freeway7 has car2 at [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we could stay at y=6 at t=4? Then freeway6 at t=4: car2 at [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we still have the problem at t=4.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways 5-8 at t=4.\n\nSo we must be at y<=4 or y>=9 at t=4? But we cannot jump to y=9 from y=6 in one step? And we are at y=6 at t=3, so at t=4 we can be at y=5,6,7.\n\nWe could go down? But then we are at freeway5,6, or7 at t=4 -> collision.\n\nSo the only safe place at t=4 is y=0,1,2,3,4,9? But we are at y=6 at t=3, we can't get to y=9 in one step? Because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo we must be at y=4 at t=4? How?\n\nWe are at y=4 at t=0. Then we went to y=5 at t=2? Then we are at y=5 at t=2. Then we can go down to y=4 at t=3? Then at t=3 we are at y=4. Then at t=4 we can stay at y=4? Or go to y=3 or y=5? But if we stay at y=4 at t=4, then we are safe? Because freeway4 at t=4:\n\nFreeway4 at t=4:\n  car1: [-35+4*4, -24+4*4] = [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8] -> safe (0 not in)\n  car2: [1+4*4, 12+4*4] = [17,28] -> safe\n  car3: [37+16,48+16]=[53,64] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut then we have to get to y=9 eventually. We are at y=4 at t=4. Then we need 5 more steps to go to y=9? So total steps would be 5 (from t=0 to t=4) and then 5 more? So H=9? But minimal without obstacles is 5, so we are adding 4 steps? We might do better.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the collision by being at a freeway that is safe at t=4.\n\nBut freeways 1,2,3 at t=4: are they safe?\n\nFreeway1 at t=4: \n  car: [-41+3*4, -30+3*4] = [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe (0 not in)\n\nSimilarly freeway2 and 3: same -> safe.\n\nSo if we can be at freeway 1,2, or 3 at t=4, we are safe.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at t=0. How to get to y=3 at t=4? Or y=2, etc.\n\nBut note: we want to eventually go to y=9, so going down might be counterproductive.\n\nBut we could go down to y=3 at some point to avoid the collision at t=4, and then go up.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAt t=0 (global90): y=4 -> safe.\nWe take action D: go down to y=3 at t=1 (global91). Then at t=1 we are at freeway3.\n\nFreeway3 at t=1: \n  car: [-41+3*1, -30+3*1] = [-38,-27] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=1: y=3. We can then stay? or go down? or up?\n\nBut we have to avoid t=4 collision. We want to be at a freeway <=3 at t=4? But we are at y=3 at t=1. We have 3 steps until t=4.\n\nWe could go down to y=2 at t=2: freeway2 at t=2: \n  car: [-41+3*2, -30+3*2] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=2: y=2. Then to y=1 at t=3: freeway1 at t=3: \n  [-41+9, -30+9] = [-32,-21] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=3: y=1. Then at t=4 (global94) we are at y=1? But we could choose to stay? or go up? We want to be safe at t=4: freeway1 at t=4: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nBut we are at y=1 at t=4. Then we need to go up to y=9: which is 8 steps? So total steps would be 4 (to get to t=4) and then 8 more? total 12? That is worse.\n\nAlternatively, from y=3 at t=1, we could go back up? But then we might hit the t=4 collision.\n\nWe need to time our movement so that we are not on freeways 5-8 at t=4, and then after t=4, the cars move away.\n\nLet me check the cars on freeways 5-8 at t=5:\n\nAt t=5, freeway5:\n  car1: [13+12*5,24+12*5]=[13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe? 0 not in [1,12] (since 1>0)\n\nSimilarly, freeway6,7,8: same.\n\nSo after t=4, the car2 has moved to positive x? At t=5, car2 is at [1,12] for each freeway 5-8. So 0 is not covered.\n\nTherefore, we can be on freeways 5-8 at t>=5 without collision.\n\nSo we only have to avoid being on freeways 5-8 at t=4.\n\nWe can be at freeway 4 at t=4? We saw that freeway4 is safe at t=4.\n\nOr freeway 1,2,3.\n\nSo we can plan:\n\nWe are at y=4 at t=0.\n\nWe need to be at a safe freeway (1,2,3,4) at t=4.\n\nAnd then after t=4, we can go up.\n\nWe want minimal steps. So we want to be as high as possible at t=4, so that we have less steps to go to 9.\n\nThe highest safe freeway at t=4 is 4.\n\nSo we want to be at y=4 at t=4.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe are at y=4 at t=0.\n\nWe can stay at y=4 for 4 steps? Then at t=1,2,3,4 we are at y=4.\n\nCheck safety at each step:\n\nt=0: y=4 -> safe (we did)\nt=1: y=4: freeway4 at t=1: [-31,-20], [5,16], [41,52] -> safe\nt=2: y=4: at t=2: \n  car1: [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16] -> safe\n  car2: [1+8,12+8]=[9,20] -> safe\n  car3: [37+8,48+8]=[45,56] -> safe\nt=3: y=4: \n  car1: [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12] -> safe (0 not in)\n  car2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe\n  car3: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe\nt=4: y=4: as above, safe.\n\nSo if we do S (stay) for 4 turns: actions at turn90: S, turn91: S, turn92: S, turn93: S. Then at t=4 (global94) we are at y=4.\n\nThen from there, we can go up: \nAt t=4 (global94) we take U: to y=5 at global95 (t=5). Then freeway5 at t=5: \n  car1: [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n\nThen at t=5: y=5. Then U to y=6 at global96 (t=6): freeway6 at t=6: \n  car1: [13+72,24+72]=[85,96] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at global97 (t=7): freeway7 at t=7: \n  car1: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+84,-48+84]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at global98 (t=8): freeway8 at t=8: \n  car1: [13+96,24+96]=[109,120] -> safe\n  car2: [-59+96,-48+96]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at global99 (t=9): but y=9 is safe (no freeway).\n\nSo total steps: from t=0 to t=9? We are at y=9 at global99 (t=9). We took 9 actions: from turn90 to turn98? \n\nThe actions:\nTurn90: S\nTurn91: S\nTurn92: S\nTurn93: S\nTurn94: U  (to y=5 at turn95? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn90 (t0): we are at y=4, we do S -> at turn91 we are still y=4.\nAt turn91 (t1): we do S -> turn92: y=4.\nAt turn92 (t2): S -> turn93: y=4.\nAt turn93 (t3): S -> turn94: y=4.\nAt turn94 (t4): we do U -> at turn95: y=5.\nAt turn95 (t5): we are at y=5 -> safe (as above)\nThen we do U at turn95: to y=6 at turn96.\nAt turn96 (t6): y=6 -> safe.\nU at turn96: to y=7 at turn97.\nU at turn97: to y=8 at turn98.\nU at turn98: to y=9 at turn99.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn99. But the problem says: we start at turn90, and we take actions until we reach (0,9). The minimal H is the number of actions? The sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so we have H actions and we reach at turn90+H.\n\nWe start at turn90: position (0,4).\nAfter H actions, we are at turn90+H, and we require that at that turn we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, after 9 actions (H=9), we are at turn90+9 = turn99, and we are at (0,9).\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe were stuck at t=4. Instead of staying at y=4 for 4 turns, we might move up and then down? But that would take more than 4 steps to get back? \n\nAlternatively, we can move up to y=5 earlier, but then come down to y=4 by t=4.\n\nFor example:\n\nt0: y=4 -> safe\nt0 action: U -> to y=5 at t1 (global91)\nAt t1: y=5 -> freeway5 at t1: [25,36] and [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nThen at t1 (global91) we are at y=5. Then we could go down to y=4 at t2 (global92). Then at t2 we are at y=4. Then we have to wait at y=4 until t4? \n\nBut we are at y=4 at t2. Then we need to be at y=4 at t4? So we can stay for two more turns.\n\nt2: at y=4 -> freeway4 at t2: \n  car1: [-27,-16] -> safe\n  car2: [9,20] -> safe\n  car3: [45,56] -> safe.\n\nThen t2 action: S -> stay at y=4 at t3 (global93)\nAt t3: y=4: freeway4 at t3: \n  car1: [-23,-12] -> safe\n  car2: [13,24] -> safe\n  car3: [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen t3 action: S -> stay at y=4 at t4 (global94): safe as before.\n\nThen at t4 (global94) we are at y=4. Then we go up as before.\n\nBut the steps: \nt0: U -> to y5 at t1\nt1: D -> to y4 at t2\nt2: S -> y4 at t3\nt3: S -> y4 at t4\nt4: U -> to y5 at t5\nthen U,U,U,U to y9.\n\nHow many steps? \nFrom t0 to t4: 5 actions (U,D,S,S,U) and then 4 Ups to go from y5 to y9? \nBut from y5 to y9 is 4 steps: y5->y6->y7->y8->y9: 4 Ups.\n\nSo total actions: \nt0: U\nt1: D\nt2: S\nt3: S\nt4: U (to y5 at t5)\nt5: U (to y6 at t6)\nt6: U (to y7 at t7)\nt7: U (to y8 at t8)\nt8: U (to y9 at t9)\n\nSo 9 actions? Same as before.\n\nBut we started with an up and then down, which didn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y=6 and then come down? But that would take even more steps.\n\nSo staying at y=4 for 4 turns is the same 9 steps.\n\nBut note: we don't have to stay the entire time. We could go up to y=5 and then wait there until after t=4? But we cannot be at y=5 at t=4. So we must leave y=5 by t=3? Because at t=4 we cannot be there.\n\nBut if we go to y=5 at t1, then we can stay at y=5 for t1 and t2? Then at t3 we must leave? But to where? If we go up to y=6 at t3, then at t3 we are at y=6 (which is safe at t3: freeway6 at t3: [49,60] and [-23,-12] -> safe). But then at t4 we are at y=6 -> collision. So we have to go down to y=4 at t3? Then we are at y=4 at t3 and t4? \n\nPlan:\n\nt0: U -> to y5 at t1 (safe)\nt1: S -> stay at y5 at t2? \n  At t2: freeway5 at t2: [37,48] and [-35,-24] -> safe.\nt2: D -> to y4 at t3? \n  At t3: we are at y4 -> freeway4 at t3: [-23,-12], [13,24], [49,60] -> safe.\nt3: S -> stay at y4 at t4 (safe)\nt4: U -> to y5 at t5 (safe as t5 for freeway5 is safe)\n\nThen from y5 at t5, we go up: \nt5: U -> y6 at t6\nt6: U -> y7 at t7\nt7: U -> y8 at t8\nt8: U -> y9 at t9\n\nTotal actions: 9 again.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can try to go higher than 4 at t=4? But we cannot because freeways 5-8 are unsafe at t=4. So we are limited to y<=4 at t=4.\n\nThe highest we can be at t=4 is y=4.\n\nNow, can we get to y=4 at t=4 with fewer than 4 actions? We start at y=4 at t=0. So we don't need to move. We can do 4 S's. That's 4 actions to get to t=4 at y=4.\n\nBut then we need 5 actions to go from y=4 to y=9: U,U,U,U,U. So total 9 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at y=4 at t=4. Then we do U at t4 (global94) to y5 at t5 (global95). Then U at t5 to y6 at t6, etc. So we do 5 Ups: from t4 to t8: 5 actions? Then at t9 we are at y9? But we start at t0 and we take actions at t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8: that's 9 actions, and we are at y9 at turn90+9=99.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 8 actions? That would mean we reach at turn98.\n\nBut we cannot be at y9 before turn98 if we start at y4 at turn90? Because we need to move 5 steps up. The minimal without obstacles is 5 steps. But we have to avoid the obstacle at t=4. So we have to delay.\n\nBut note: if we could go up during the first 4 turns without being caught at t=4? We tried and we got stuck.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0? Then we are safe at t=4? But then we have to climb 9 steps? That would be more.\n\nBut we want minimal.\n\nWe see that the minimal steps might be 9.\n\nBut let me see if we can get to y=9 in 8 actions.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\nt0: S -> y4 at t1\nt1: S -> y4 at t2\nt2: S -> y4 at t3\nt3: U -> to y5 at t4 (global94) -> but at t4 we are at y5 -> collision! Because freeway5 at t4 has car2 at [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to y5 at t4.\n\nWe must be at y4 or below at t4.\n\nThen at t4 we are at y4. Then we do 5 Ups: at t4: U (to y5 at t5) ... until t8: U to y9 at t9.\n\nSo we need 9 actions.\n\nBut wait, after t4, the cars are safe. So from y4 at t4, we can do 5 consecutive Ups? But we have to check each step.\n\nWe already did: \nt4: U -> y5 at t5: freeway5 at t5: safe (car2 at [1,12])\nt5: U -> y6 at t6: freeway6 at t6: [13,24] for car2? \n  At t6: freeway6: car2: [-59+12*6, -48+12*6] = [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24] -> safe.\nt6: U -> y7 at t7: freeway7 at t7: car2: [-59+84, -48+84]=[25,36] -> safe.\nt7: U -> y8 at t8: freeway8 at t8: car2: [37,48] -> safe.\nt8: U -> y9 at t9: safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut can we combine the last step? No.\n\nIs there a way to save one step? For example, if we can be at y=5 at t5 without having to wait? But we have to get past the t=4 obstacle.\n\nWe could go up to y=7 by t=3, then at t=3 we go down to y=6? But then at t=4 we are at y=6 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, at t=3 we go down to y=4? Then we avoid collision at t=4? But then we are at y=4 at t=4. Then we have to go up 5 steps: same as before.\n\nBut we used one extra step (going up to y=7 and then down) so total steps would be 10? Worse.\n\nSo the minimal is 9.\n\nBut note: we don't have to stay at y=4 for all 4 turns. We could go up and then come back, but that doesn't save steps.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 before t=4? But we cannot because we can only move one per turn. From y=4 at t0, we can be at y=7 at t3 (by U,U,U). But then at t4 we have to be at y=8? which is unsafe. Or we can be at y=7 at t3 and then at t4 we go to y=8? unsafe. Or stay at y=7? unsafe at t4.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn90: S\nTurn91: S\nTurn92: S\nTurn93: S\nTurn94: U\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: U\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: U\n\nBut wait, at turn94 we do U, which moves us to y=5 at turn95. Then at turn95 we do U to y=6 at turn96, etc. Then at turn99 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is for turns: 90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98: 9 actions.\n\nWe can write:\n\nTurn 90: S\nTurn 91: S\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\n\nBut let me confirm the positions:\n\nAt turn90 (start): y=4\nAfter action at turn90 (S): at turn91: y=4\nAfter turn91 (S): turn92: y=4\nAfter turn92 (S): turn93: y=4\nAfter turn93 (S): turn94: y=4\nAfter turn94 (U): turn95: y=5\nAfter turn95 (U): turn96: y=6\nAfter turn96 (U): turn97: y=7\nAfter turn97 (U): turn98: y=8\nAfter turn98 (U): turn99: y=9 -> goal.\n\nAnd we have checked the safety at each freeway step.\n\nBut we must check every turn we are on a freeway (y in [1,8]):\n\nAt turn90: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (t=0)\nAt turn91: y=4 -> freeway4: t=1: safe\nAt turn92: y=4 -> freeway4: t=2: safe\nAt turn93: y=4 -> freeway4: t=3: safe\nAt turn94: y=4 -> freeway4: t=4: safe\nAt turn95: y=5 -> freeway5: t=5: safe (as computed: car2 at [1,12] -> 0 not in)\nAt turn96: y=6 -> freeway6: t=6: car2 at [13,24] -> safe\nAt turn97: y=7 -> freeway7: t=7: car2 at [25,36] -> safe\nAt turn98: y=8 -> freeway8: t=8: car2 at [37,48] -> safe\nAt turn99: y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nIs there a way with 8 steps? We would have to reach y=9 by turn98. That means we start at turn90, and after 8 actions (turns 90 to 97) we are at turn98 at y=9.\n\nBut we start at y=4. We need 5 net up moves. So we must do at least 5 Ups. The other 3 actions can be S or D? But if we do D, we go down, so we need more Ups. So we must do exactly 5 Ups and 3 S? Or 5 Ups and 3 D? But then the net up is 5 - (number of D) which must be 5? So we cannot do any D. Therefore, we must do 5 Ups and 3 S? But then we would be at y=4+5=9? Yes.\n\nSo we can have a sequence of 5 U and 3 S. But we have to avoid the collision at t=4 (global94).\n\nAt global94 (which is turn90+4=94) we are at step t=4.\n\nWe must not be on freeways 5-8 at t=4.\n\nBut if we use 3 S and 5 U, we have to distribute the actions.\n\nWe start at y=4 at t=0.\n\nWe have to be at y=9 at t=8 (global98).\n\nWe must be at a safe freeway at t=4.\n\nThe safe freeways at t=4 are y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo we must be at y<=4 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=0: y=4.\n\nAt t=4, we must have y(4) <=4.\n\nBut we have done 4 actions: some U, S, D? But if we do a U, we go up, D down, S same.\n\nTo be at y<=4 at t=4, the net movement in the first 4 steps must be <=0.\n\nBut we have done some Ups and Ss and Ds? Let u be number of U, d of D, s of S in the first 4 actions: u+d+s=4, and net = u - d.\n\nWe require: 4 + (u-d) <=4  => u-d <=0.\n\nBut we have 5 Ups in total 8 actions. So we have to do 5 Ups and 3 S? (since D would require even more Ups to compensate, which we don't have).\n\nSo total Ups: 5, and we have to do 3 S and 0 D? Then the net movement is 5.\n\nBut we start at y=4, so after 8 actions we are at 4+5=9.\n\nIn the first 4 actions, if we do k Ups, then the net in first 4 is k (since no D). Then at t=4, y=4+k.\n\nWe require 4+k <=4 => k<=0. So k=0.\n\nThat means we do 0 Ups in the first 4 actions. But we have to do 5 Ups in the last 4 actions? But the last 4 actions (from t=4 to t=8) are 4 actions. We can do at most 4 Ups. So we can only get to y=4 + 4 = 8 at t=8? But we need y=9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to do in 8 actions.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 90: S\nTurn 91: S\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nt1=90, and t from 0 to H-1. So for t=0: a_{90}, t=1: a_{91}, ... t=8: a_{98}.\n\nWe have 9 actions.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: S\nTurn 91: S\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can start with an U? Then we go to y5 at t1, but then we have to come back to avoid t4? But that would require the same or more steps.\n\nWe already saw that it leads to 9 steps.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 90\\) is 9, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The direct path upward (5 consecutive \"U\" actions) would reach \\(y = 9\\) in 5 turns, but it results in a collision at turn 94 (global turn) when on freeway \\(y = 8\\) (or any freeway \\(5\\) to \\(8\\)) due to a car spanning \\([-11, 0]\\) at that turn.\n- The collision occurs specifically at \\(t = 4\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 90\\), so global turn 94) for freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) because a car on each covers position \\(0\\).\n- To avoid this, the player must remain at \\(y \\leq 4\\) (safe freeways) at \\(t = 4\\) (turn 94). The highest safe freeway at \\(t = 4\\) is \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 is safe at all required turns).\n- After \\(t = 4\\), the cars on freeways \\(5\\) to \\(8\\) no longer cover \\(0\\) (e.g., at \\(t = 5\\), the car that caused the collision is at \\([1, 12]\\)), allowing safe upward movement.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Stay at \\(y = 4\\) for the first 4 turns (turns 90 to 93)** to avoid being on freeways \\(5\\) to \\(8\\) at \\(t = 4\\) (turn 94). This is safe because freeway 4 is clear at \\(t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\):\n   - \\(t = 0\\): cars at \\([-35, -24]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), \\([37, 48]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - \\(t = 1\\): cars at \\([-31, -20]\\), \\([5, 16]\\), \\([41, 52]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - \\(t = 2\\): cars at \\([-27, -16]\\), \\([9, 20]\\), \\([45, 56]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - \\(t = 3\\): cars at \\([-23, -12]\\), \\([13, 24]\\), \\([49, 60]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - \\(t = 4\\): cars at \\([-19, -8]\\), \\([17, 28]\\), \\([53, 64]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n2. **Move upward 5 times consecutively (turns 94 to 98)** to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 99. The freeways are safe after \\(t = 4\\):\n   - Turn 94 (action \"U\"): to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 95 (\\(t = 5\\)). Freeway 5: cars at \\([73, 84]\\) and \\([1, 12]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - Turn 95 (action \"U\"): to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 96 (\\(t = 6\\)). Freeway 6: cars at \\([85, 96]\\) and \\([13, 24]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - Turn 96 (action \"U\"): to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 97 (\\(t = 7\\)). Freeway 7: cars at \\([97, 108]\\) and \\([25, 36]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - Turn 97 (action \"U\"): to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 98 (\\(t = 8\\)). Freeway 8: cars at \\([109, 120]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\) → no \\(0\\).\n   - Turn 98 (action \"U\"): to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 99. \\(y = 9\\) is safe (no freeway).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H = 9\\) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: S \\\\\nTurn 91: S \\\\\nTurn 92: S \\\\\nTurn 93: S \\\\\nTurn 94: U \\\\\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: U \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 94, and I start at y=0. I can move up, down, or stay, but since I need to go up to 9, down might not be helpful unless to avoid something.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are and how they move over time. The cars are on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move from y to y+1 or y-1, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide to move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and I only check for cars on y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1}, and I check for cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at turn t_1=94. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving. Left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases, tail decreases. Right-moving: span moves right, head increases, tail increases.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head is larger, tail is smaller, so span is from tail to head, I think.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which might be from h to τ, but if it's moving left, h should be left, τ right? No.\n\nLet's clarify the coordinate.\n\nI think position 0 is the point we care about, and cars move horizontally. Positive direction is right, I assume.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, it's going towards negative x, so at time t, position decreases.\n\nHead and tail: I think head is the front of the car, tail is the back.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, head is on the left, tail on the right? No.\n\nStandard: if a car is moving left, its front (head) is facing left, so when it moves, head decreases, tail decreases. But the span: since it's moving left, the leftmost point is head, rightmost is tail, so span is [head, tail] if head < tail? But head should be smaller if moving left.\n\nAssume x-axis, with positive to the right.\n\nFor left-moving car: it moves negative direction. Head is the front, which is left, so head has smaller x, tail has larger x. So span at time t is [head, tail] with head < tail.\n\nAt time T, it becomes [head - s(T-t_1), tail - s(T-t_1)], so both decrease, car moves left.\n\nFor right-moving car: moving positive direction, head is front, right side, so head has larger x, tail has smaller x. So span at t_1 is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nThen at T, [tail + s(T-t_1), head + s(T-t_1)], both increase.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, head h should be larger than tail τ, and for left-moving, head smaller than tail? But in the table, all directions are right, so I think for right-moving, head > tail.\n\nLook at the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nh = -48, τ = -59, d = right.\n\n-48 > -59, so head -48, tail -59, but if head is larger, and moving right, yes, head at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from -59 to -48, so span [ -59, -48]? But according to update, for right-moving, span(t_1) is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 3(T-94), -48 + 3(T-94)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn freeway 4, there is (24,13,right,4), h=24, τ=13, 24>13, so [13,24] at t_1.\n\nAlso, (0,-11,right,12) on freeway 5, etc.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nCollision if 0 is in span for that freeway at turn T when I am on that y at turn T.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=94, and y=0 is not a freeway, so no car there, I think I'm safe at y=0. But I need to move to freeways to go up.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, so no cars there. So at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is not on freeway, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9 through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nI need to minimize the number of turns H.\n\nThe sequence starts from t_1, so at turn t_1, I am at (0,0), and I take action a_{t_1} which determines y_{t_1 +1}, but let's see the time.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I take action a_t, and then at the end of turn t, y is updated to y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the collision is checked at turn T, when I am at position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and if y_T is between 1 and 8, I check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThen I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nFor the sequence, I need actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1, I have y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe player position: at turn t_1, I am at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nAfter one action, at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, at turn t_1 + k, I am at y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, so T = t_1 + H for some H, but H is the number of turns, so actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H, I am at position after H actions.\n\nSet t = 0 at turn t_1 for simplicity. So relative time.\n\nLet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t_1, position y=0.\n\nTake action a_0 at τ=0, then y at τ=1 is y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nGenerally, at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nTake action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nI need y_τ = 9 for some τ, and minimize τ.\n\nBut τ starts from 0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y_H should be 9.\n\nThe actions are from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nAnd for each τ from 0 to H-1, when I am at position y_τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, I must not have collision on that freeway at time τ.\n\nNow, time τ corresponds to turn t_1 + τ.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when cars have 0 in their span at time τ.\n\nDefine the span for each car at time τ, where τ = T - t_1.\n\nFor a car, at relative time τ, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: but all cars here are right-moving, since direction is right.\n\nIn the table, all directions are right, so all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, span at time τ is [τ + s τ, h + s τ]? Let's see.\n\nFrom above: at absolute time T, span is [τ + s (T - t_1), h + s (T - t_1)]\n\nSince T - t_1 = τ, so [τ + s τ, h + s τ]? τ is used for two things, bad.\n\nUse t for relative time.\n\nSet t = T - t_1, so t is time offset from t_1.\n\nAt time t, span for a car is [tail + s t, head + s t]\n\nBecause τ + s t and h + s t, where t = T - t_1.\n\ntail and head are at t_1.\n\nFor example, car on freeway k with (head, tail, dir, speed) = (h, τ, d, s)\n\nSince d=right for all, span at time t is [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nSince for right-moving, tail < head, so τ < h.\n\nSo inequality: τ + s t <= 0 and 0 <= h + s t\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nFrom τ + s t <= 0, s t <= -τ, t <= -τ / s\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s t, s t >= -h, t >= -h / s\n\nSo t must satisfy ceil( -h / s ) <= t <= floor( -τ / s )? Let's think.\n\nt must be integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt is integer, relative time.\n\nSo 0 is in span at time t if:\n\nτ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nWhich implies:\n\ns t <= -τ and s t >= -h\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nSo -h <= s t <= -τ\n\nThen t must satisfy ceil( -h / s ) <= t <= floor( -τ / s )\n\nBecause s t >= -h, so t >= ceil( -h / s )\n\ns t <= -τ, so t <= floor( -τ / s )\n\nAnd since τ and h are integers, s integer, we can compute.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to find all t where for that freeway, there is some car with 0 in span.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at time t, if I am on it, collision.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo h = -48, τ = -59, s=3\n\nt must satisfy ceil( -(-48)/3 ) <= t <= floor( -(-59)/3 ) = ceil(48/3) <= t <= floor(59/3)\n\n48/3=16, 59/3=19.666, floor 19\n\nSo ceil(16) =16, floor(19.666)=19\n\nSo t from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision at t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48,-59,right,3) same as above.\n\nIn the table, freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,3), identical to freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=4\n\nt: ceil( -(-48)/4 ) <= t <= floor( -(-59)/4 ) = ceil(48/4) <= t <= floor(59/4) = ceil(12) <= t <= floor(14.75) = 12 <= t <= 14\n\n48/4=12, 59/4=14.75, floor=14, so t=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) h=-12, τ=-23\n\nt: ceil( -(-12)/4 ) <= t <= floor( -(-23)/4 ) = ceil(12/4) <= t <= floor(23/4) = ceil(3) <= t <= floor(5.75) = 3 <= t <= 5\n\nt=3,4,5\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) h=24, τ=13\n\nt: ceil( -24/4 ) <= t <= floor( -13/4 ) = ceil(-6) <= t <= floor(-3.25)\n\n-6 is integer, ceil(-6) = -6\n\nfloor(-3.25) = -4? No\n\ns t >= -h, s=4, h=24, so 4t >= -24, t >= -6\n\ns t <= -τ, τ=13, 4t <= -13, t <= -13/4 = -3.25, so t <= -4 since t integer? t <= floor(-3.25) = -4? floor is less than or equal.\n\n-3.25, floor is -4, since -4 < -3.25 < -3, floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so floor(-3.25) = -4.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-6) = -6.\n\nBut t >= ceil(-24/4) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nt <= floor(-13/4) = floor(-3.25) = -4\n\nSo t from -6 to -4 inclusive.\n\nBut t is time offset, relative to now, t=0, so t=-6,-5,-4 are in the past, before current turn. So at current and future t, not collision for this car.\n\nNow for freeway 4, the dangerous times are from the cars:\n\nFirst car: t=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: t=3,4,5\n\nThird car: no future collision\n\nSo overall, on freeway 4, collision at t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nt: ceil( -(-48)/12 ) <= t <= floor( -(-59)/12 ) = ceil(48/12) <= t <= floor(59/12) = ceil(4) <= t <= floor(4.916) = 4 <= t <= 4\n\nSo t=4\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) h=0, τ=-11\n\nt: ceil( -0/12 ) <= t <= floor( -(-11)/12 ) = ceil(0) <= t <= floor(11/12) = 0 <= t <= 0\n\nSince ceil(0)=0, floor(11/12)=0? 11/12=0.916, floor=0.\n\ns t >= -h = -0 =0, so t >=0\n\ns t <= -τ = -(-11)=11, s t <=11, 12t <=11, t <= 11/12 <1, so t <=0 since t integer.\n\nt >=0 and t <=0, so t=0.\n\nAt t=0, for this car, span is [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-11 +12*0, 0 +12*0] = [-11,0]\n\n0 is included, since 0 <=0 and -11<=0, so yes, at t=0, 0 is in span.\n\nNow, t=0 is the current time.\n\nBut at t=0, I am at y=0, which is not freeway 5, freeway 5 is y=5, I am at y=0, so not on freeway 5, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5, first car at t=4, second car at t=0.\n\nBut t=0 is now, not on freeway, so dangerous time for freeway 5 is t=4 (from first car), and t=0 but not relevant.\n\nSecond car only at t=0.\n\nNow, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-48,-59,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, first car: t= ceil(48/12)=4, floor(59/12)=4.916 floor=4, so t=4\n\nSecond car: t=0\n\nDangerous at t=0 and t=4, but t=0 not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the times when collision occurs, i.e., when 0 is occupied.\n\nFreeway 1: t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 3: same, t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4: from above, t=3,4,5 (from second car) and t=12,13,14 (from first car), and third car not future.\n\nt=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: t=4 (from first car, since second car at t=0 not relevant)\n\nFreeway 6: t=4\n\nFreeway 7: t=4\n\nFreeway 8: t=4\n\nNow, for freeway 5,6,7,8, at t=4, collision.\n\nBut freeway 4 also at t=4.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=0 to y=9 at some t.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum time is 9 moves, to go up each time.\n\nBut I may need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go straight up.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, I take action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, with Δy from a_0.\n\nAt time t, I am at position y_t, and take action a_t.\n\nFor collision, at each time t, when I am at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and t is dangerous for that freeway, collision.\n\nSince I start at y=0, at t=0, I am safe, not on freeway.\n\nI take a_0, which can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at t=1.\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, if a_0=U, Δy_0=+1, so y_1=1.\n\nAt time t=1, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, freeway 1: dangerous at t=16-19, not 1, so safe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways dangerous at t=3,4,5,12-14,16-19, not 1.\n\nSo at t=1, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=2 at t=2, similarly, no danger at t=2, since min dangerous t is 3.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, should be safe.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8, dangerous times: earliest is t=3 for freeway 4.\n\nAt t=2, no danger, so y=2 safe.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=3.\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous at t=16-19, not 3.\n\nBut freeway 4 is dangerous at t=3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4, I am at y=3, so not on freeway 4.\n\nI am at y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has cars, dangerous at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt t=3, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other freeways, at t=3, only freeway 4 is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nSo at t=3, y=3 is safe.\n\nNow, if I go up to y=4 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 is dangerous at t=4, since t=3,4,5.\n\nSo if I am on y=4 at t=4, collision.\n\nCannot be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nAt t=3, I am at y=3. Instead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for one turn.\n\nLet's see the times.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nI take action a_3.\n\nIf I stay, a_3=S, then y_4 = y_3 +0 =3, so at t=4, I am at y=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, dangerous at t=16-19, not 4, so safe at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, I am at y=3, I can go up to y=4 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, freeway 4 is dangerous? Freeway 4 dangerous at t=3,4,5.\n\nt=5 is dangerous for y=4.\n\nAt t=5, if I am on y=4, collision.\n\nIf I go up at t=4 to y=4 at t=5? Let's see.\n\nAt t=4, I am at y=3 (after staying), take action a_4.\n\nIf a_4=U, then y_5 = y_4 +1 =3+1=4.\n\nAt time t=5, I am at y=4.\n\nBut t=5 is dangerous for freeway 4, so collision.\n\nIf I stay at t=4, y_5=3, then at t=5, y=3, safe, but I need to go up.\n\nI could go down, but that might not be efficient.\n\nSince freeway 4 is dangerous only from t=3 to5, and t=12 to14.\n\nAfter t=5, it is safe until t=12.\n\nBut t=12 is later.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother issue: at t=4, multiple freeways are dangerous.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all dangerous at t=4.\n\nAnd freeway 4 also.\n\nBut I am not on them yet.\n\nNow, back to point.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=4 on y=4, I need not to be on y=4 at t=4 or t=5? At t=4, if I am on y=4, collision.\n\nAt t=5, if on y=4, also collision for freeway 4.\n\nBut at t=4, freeway 4 is dangerous, so if on y=4 at t=4, collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=5.\n\nSo I need to be not on y=4 at t=4 and not at t=5.\n\nSince I am coming from below, I can delay going to y=4 until after t=5.\n\nFor example, at t=3, instead of going up, I stay or go down.\n\nBut going down to y=2 might be worse.\n\nSo at t=3, I am at y=3.\n\nI take S, so y_4 =3, at t=4 I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, I take S again, y_5=3, at t=5 I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, I take U, to go to y=4 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 dangerous at t=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nt=6 not dangerous, so safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see if there are other dangers.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=5, but freeway 5 is dangerous at t=4.\n\nt=4 is past, so at t=6 or later, should be safe except other times.\n\nFreeway 5 dangerous only at t=4, since the first car at t=4, second at t=0.\n\nSo for t>4 or t<4 except t=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8, only dangerous at t=4.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at t=12,13,14.\n\nt=12 is later.\n\nNow, from above, at t=6, I am at y=4.\n\nThen I can go up to y=5 at t=7? Let's step by step.\n\nAt t=5, after staying, I am at y=3, take U, so y_6 = y_5 +1 =4 (since at t=5, y=3, take a_5=U, y_6=4)\n\nAt t=6, I am at y=4, safe as above.\n\nThen at t=6, take U, to y_7=5.\n\nAt t=7, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 dangerous only at t=4, so at t=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, go to y=6 at t=8, safe, since freeway 6 dangerous only t=4.\n\nSimilarly y=7 at t=9, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut y=9 is not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 4 dangerous again at t=12,13,14, but I am not on it.\n\nNow, but at t=10, y=8, then to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut let's count the time.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAction a_0: U, so y_1=1 at t=1\n\na_1: U, y_2=2 at t=2\n\na_2: U, y_3=3 at t=3\n\nNow at t=3, y=3, instead of U, I take S, so y_4=3 at t=4\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, take S, y_5=3 at t=5\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, take U, y_6=4 at t=6\n\nThen a_6: U, y_7=5 at t=7\n\na_7: U, y_8=6 at t=8\n\na_8: U, y_9=7 at t=9\n\na_9: U, y_10=8 at t=10\n\na_10: U, y_11=9 at t=11\n\nNow, at t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, I used 11 turns? From t=0 to t=10 actions, 11 steps to y=11? Let's see.\n\nAt t=0, position y=0\n\nAfter action a_0 at t=0, y_1=1 at t=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_10 at t=10, y_11=9 at t=11\n\nSo at turn t=11 (relative), y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions? τ from 0 to 10 inclusive, 11 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, relative, actions at τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions, and at τ=11, position y=9.\n\nBut τ=11 means turn t_1 + 11.\n\nMinimal might be less.\n\nBut in this path, I spent two extra turns staying at y=3 to avoid t=4 and t=5 on y=4.\n\nBut at t=4 and t=5, y=4 is dangerous, but I avoided by not being there.\n\nCould I go faster?\n\nFor example, at t=3, instead of staying, I go down to y=2? But that might not help.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=3, I could go up directly if not for danger.\n\nBut I have to avoid.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=4 before t=3 or after t=5.\n\nBut before t=3, at t=2, I am at y=2, if I go up to y=3 at t=3, or to y=4? No, each move changes by 1.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=2, I take action to go to y=3 at t=3, cannot jump.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 before t=4 or after t=5 easily.\n\nAt t=2, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I take U, to y=3 at t=3.\n\nIf I take S, stay y=2 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, y=2 is freeway 2, dangerous only at t=16-19, not 3, so safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 at t=6 as before.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=3, I go up to y=4 at t=4, but at t=4, y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=3, I stay, y=4=3 at t=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, I could go up, but to y=5? No, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nIf at t=4, I am at y=3, take U, then y_5=4, at t=5, y=4, but t=5 dangerous for y=4, collision.\n\nIf take S, y_5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, take U, y_6=4 at t=6, safe.\n\nSo I need to stay at least one turn, but I stayed two turns? In the path above, from t=3 to t=4 and t=5, I stayed at y=3 for two turns: at t=4 and t=5 I am at y=3.\n\nt=4: y=3, t=5: y=3.\n\nThen at t=5, take U to y=4 at t=6.\n\nBut I could stay only one turn.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, take S, so at t=4, y=3.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, I could take D, down to y=2 at t=5? But then I go down, which is away from goal.\n\nThen at t=5, y=2, take U to y=3 at t=6, then to y=4 at t=7, later.\n\nWorse than staying.\n\nSo staying at y=3 for two turns is better.\n\nBut at t=4, when I am at y=3, it is safe, and freeway 5,6,7,8 are dangerous at t=4, but I am not on them.\n\nNow, after that, I go up to y=4 at t=6, then to y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut at t=7, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, but freeway 4 has danger at t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=12, if I am on y=4, collision.\n\nIn my path, at t=12, where am I?\n\nFrom above: at t=6, y=4\n\nt=7, y=5\n\nt=8, y=6\n\nt=9, y=7\n\nt=10, y=8\n\nt=11, y=9\n\nt=12, not reached, since at t=11, y=9, goal.\n\nt=11 is when I reach, so for t=12, I don't care, since I have reached at t=11.\n\nt=11 is relative time 11, which is before t=12.\n\nt=12 is relative 12.\n\nIn my sequence, from t=6 to t=11, y from 4 to 9, t=6:y=4, t=7:y=5, t=8:y=6, t=9:y=7, t=10:y=8, t=11:y=9.\n\nt=12 not in path.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at t=12,13,14, but I am not on it during those times.\n\nSimilarly, other dangers at t=16-19, later.\n\nSo this path should work, with 11 turns.\n\nBut can I do with fewer?\n\nMinimal is 9 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut here, I had to avoid t=4 on y=4.\n\nThe danger on y=4 is from t=3 to5, but since I come from below, I need to be after t=5.\n\nSimilarly, I could be before t=3, but at t=2, I am at y=2, going to y=3 at t=3, cannot be at y=4 earlier.\n\nUnless I start earlier, but I start at y=0 t=0.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher y and wait there.\n\nFor example, go up quickly to y=5 or something.\n\nBut y=5 is dangerous at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=5 is dangerous.\n\nLet's see the times.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\na0: U, y1=1 at t=1\n\na1: U, y2=2 at t=2\n\na2: U, y3=3 at t=3\n\nNow, at t=3, I need to not go to y=4 immediately.\n\nBut at t=3, if I go to y=4 at t=4, collision.\n\nSo I must not be at y=4 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, if I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, I cannot go to y=4 because if I go U, y5=4 at t=5, collision at t=5.\n\nSo I must stay or go down.\n\nIf I stay at t=4, y5=3 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I can go U to y6=4 at t=6.\n\nBut at t=5, y=3, take U, y6=4.\n\nNow, from t=3 to t=4, I stayed at y=3? At t=3, position y=3, I take action.\n\nIf I take S at t=3, y4=3 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, position y=3, I take S, y5=3 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, take U, y6=4 at t=6.\n\nI used two stays.\n\nBut at t=4, after I am at y=3, I could go to y=4 but only if t=4 not dangerous, but it is, so I cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly or something, but no, I have to go step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=4, freeway 5,6,7,8 are also dangerous, but I am not on them.\n\nBut for y=4, it is dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nt=4 and t=5 both dangerous for y=4.\n\nSo I need to be at y=4 only at t <=2 or t>=6.\n\nBut t<=2, at t=2, I am at y=2, cannot be at y=4.\n\nSo only possible at t>=6.\n\nThus, I must reach y=4 at t=6 or later.\n\nIn the path, I reach y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen y=5 at t=7, etc., to y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, the freeway 4 danger at t=12-14, but I pass y=4 at t=6, which is before, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have no danger except at t=4 for y=5-8, but I pass them after t=7, safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions, to reach at t=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can save time by not staying twice.\n\nFor example, at t=3, instead of staying, I could go down to y=2 at t=4, but then I have to come back, worse.\n\nOr, I could go up to y=4 at t=4 but avoid collision, but impossible.\n\nUnless the car is not at 0, but it is.\n\nAnother thought: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I take action to move to y_{T+1}, but at that turn T, I am only on y_T, so if I move up, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I don't interact with y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a different freeway.\n\nBut I think 11 is the minimal with this.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach faster.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, I take D, down to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, take U to y=3 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen take U to y=4 at t=6.\n\nSame as before, but I went down and up, which takes two actions to return, whereas staying takes one action to stay, but in terms of time, from t=3 to t=6, I reach y=4 at t=6 with stay-stay-up or down-up-up, both take three actions to go from y=3 at t=3 to y=4 at t=6.\n\nIn stay-stay-up: at t=3 y=3, t=4 y=3 (after S), t=5 y=3 (after S), t=6 y=4 (after U at t=5)\n\nActions: at t=3: S, at t=4: S, at t=5: U\n\nIn down-up-up: at t=3: D, so y4=2 at t=4; at t=4: U, y5=3 at t=5; at t=5: U, y6=4 at t=6. Same, but I visited y=2 unnecessarily.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nWith one stay: is it possible?\n\nFor example, at t=3, y=3, take S, so at t=4, y=3.\n\nThen at t=4, I need to go to y=4, but if I take U, y5=4 at t=5, which is dangerous.\n\nUnless at t=5, it is not dangerous, but it is.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 at t=4 or something, impossible.\n\nAnother freeway: but I have to go through y=4.\n\nUnless I skip, but I can't.\n\nSo I think I must spend at least one extra turn to avoid.\n\nMinimal time to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns, but here I used 11, with 2 extra.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid by going slower or faster elsewhere.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, I could stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would delay, worse.\n\nOr, after y=4, go faster, but I am going up one per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=4 later but go faster to higher, but no.\n\nAnother danger: freeway 4 at t=12,13,14, but since I reach y=9 at t=11, before that, no issue.\n\nBut suppose I take more time, I might hit that, but in this case not.\n\nNow, but in freeway 5,6,7,8, danger only at t=4, which I avoid since I am not on them at t=4.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at t=7, which is after t=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's list all dangerous times per y.\n\nFor each freeway y, the dangerous times.\n\ny=1: dangerous at t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same, t=16-19\n\ny=3: same, t=16-19\n\ny=4: dangerous at t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: dangerous at t=4\n\ny=6: dangerous at t=4\n\ny=7: dangerous at t=4\n\ny=8: dangerous at t=4\n\nNow, I need to be at position y_t at time t, and avoid being on y when t is dangerous for that y.\n\nFor y=4, I cannot be on it at t=3,4,5 or t=12,13,14.\n\nBut t=3,4,5 are early, t=12-14 late.\n\nSince I start from low, I need to pass y=4 before t=3 or between t=6 and t=11, or after t=14.\n\nBefore t=3: at t=2, I am at y=2, can be y=3 at t=3, not y=4.\n\nAfter t=14 too late.\n\nSo only possible between t=6 and t=11 to be on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, I cannot be on it at t=4.\n\nSince t=4 is early, I can be on y=5 at other times, e.g., t<4 or t>4.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at t=7>4, safe.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible except where blocked.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=2, I go up to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen I need to stay at y=3 until I can go to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThe earliest I can go to y=4 is t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=4.\n\nThen from there, I can go up each turn to y=9 at t=11.\n\nt=6: y=4, t=7:y=5, t=8:y=6, t=9:y=7, t=10:y=8, t=11:y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I reach y=4 earlier than t=6?\n\nFor example, at t=5, can I be at y=4? But at t=5, y=4 is dangerous, so no.\n\nAt t=4, dangerous.\n\nt=3 dangerous.\n\nt=2, I can be at y=2 only, not y=4.\n\nSo no, earliest safe time for y=4 is t=6.\n\nThus, I must be at y=4 at t=6 or later.\n\nThen y=9 at t=11 or later.\n\nThus minimal time is 11 turns.\n\nIn terms of actions: from t=0 to t=10 actions, H=11 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe number of turns H such that at turn t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nIn relative, at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y_H =9.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\ny_0=0.\n\nAfter k actions, at time k, y_k.\n\nSet y_0=0 at τ=0.\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1, y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nThe actions are taken at τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, where t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, to have y_H=9, since I start at y_0=0, and each action can increase by at most 1, so minimum H=9 if all up.\n\nBut here, to avoid, I need to have some stays, so H>9.\n\nIn my sequence: at τ=0, action U, y1=1\n\nτ=1, U, y2=2\n\nτ=2, U, y3=3\n\nτ=3, S, y4=3? y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ, take action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nSo at τ=0, y0=0, take a0, y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nAt τ=1, y1, take a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\n...\n\nAt τ=k, y_k, take a_k, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nI need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt τ=0: y0=0, take U, so y1=1\n\nτ=1: y1=1, take U, y2=2\n\nτ=2: y2=2, take U, y3=3\n\nτ=3: y3=3, take S, so y4=3  (since Δy=0)\n\nτ=4: y4=3, take S, so y5=3  (y4=3, take S, y5=3)\n\nIn my earlier, at τ=4, I have y4=3, take S, then y5=3\n\nBut at τ=4, position is y4=3.\n\nThen at τ=4, take S, y5=3\n\nThen τ=5: y5=3, take U, so y6=4\n\nτ=6: y6=4, take U, y7=5\n\n...\nup to\nτ=10: y10=8, take U, y11=9\n\nSo at τ=11, y11=9.\n\nThus H=11, since y_H=9 at H=11.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nBut the number of turns H is 11.\n\nTo reach at H=9, y9=9, but that would require no delays, but I cannot because of y=4 at t=4 and 5.\n\nFor example, to be at y=4 at τ=4, but dangerous.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be at y=4 at τ=6 with fewer actions.\n\nFrom y0=0 to y3=3 in 3 actions: U,U,U at τ=0,1,2.\n\nThen to y4: but cannot go directly at τ=3 or τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, I take S, so y4=3 at τ=4.\n\nThen to go to y4, I need to take U at some point.\n\nAt τ=4, y4=3, take S, y5=3 at τ=5.\n\nThen at τ=5, take U, y6=4 at τ=6.\n\nSo from τ=3 to τ=6, I used three actions to go from y3=3 to y6=4, with two S and one U.\n\nI could take only one S.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y3=3, take S, y4=3.\n\nThen at τ=4, y4=3, take U, but y5=4, at τ=5, y=4, but τ=5 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I take no S, but go down or something, worse.\n\nSo I must take at least two actions between τ=3 and τ=6 that don't increase y, but since I need to stay at y=3, I take S.\n\nThus, from τ=3 to τ=6, I have three actions: at τ=3 S, τ=4 S, τ=5 U to reach y6=4.\n\nWith only one stay, I cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, but there is another danger: at τ=12,13,14 for y=4, but since I am at y=9 at τ=11, before that, no issue.\n\nNow, for the sequence, relative to t_1.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=94.\n\nPlayer position at turn 94: (0,0)\n\nActions for turn 94, 95, ..., up to turn 94 + 10 = 104.\n\nAt turn 104, action, then at turn 105, position y=9.\n\nLet's list actions.\n\nTurn 94: a_{94}, which is U, since we go to y=1\n\nIn relative: τ=0, turn 94, action a_{t_1} = a_{94}\n\nIn the answer, it should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, the car state is given at t_1=94.\n\nIn the sequence, I have:\n\nAt turn 94: take U, to go to y=1 at next turn.\n\nAt turn 95: take U, to y=2\n\nTurn 96: take U, to y=3\n\nTurn 97: take S, stay, so y same, at turn 98 position y=3? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, take action a_T.\n\nAfter action, at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn 94: position y=0, take action a_{94} = U, so at turn 95, position y=1\n\nTurn 95: position y=1, take a_{95} = U, so at turn 96, y=2\n\nTurn 96: position y=2, take a_{96} = U, so at turn 97, y=3\n\nTurn 97: position y=3, take a_{97} = S, so at turn 98, y=3 (since Δy=0)\n\nTurn 98: position y=3, take a_{98} = S, so at turn 99, y=3\n\nTurn 99: position y=3, take a_{99} = U, so at turn 100, y=4\n\nTurn 100: position y=4, take a_{100} = U, so at turn 101, y=5\n\nTurn 101: position y=5, take a_{101} = U, so at turn 102, y=6\n\nTurn 102: position y=6, take a_{102} = U, so at turn 103, y=7\n\nTurn 103: position y=7, take a_{103} = U, so at turn 104, y=8\n\nTurn 104: position y=8, take a_{104} = U, so at turn 105, y=9\n\nNow, at turn 105, position y=9, reached.\n\nThe actions are from turn 94 to turn 104, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 94 to 104.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H = 94 + 11 = 105, position is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the freeway 5,6,7,8, at t=4 relative, which is turn 94 + 4 = 98.\n\nAt turn 98, relative t=4, I am at y=3, not on y=5,6,7,8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then y10=9.\n\ny0=0, so I need to increase by 9 in 10 steps, so one stay or down, but down would require more up, worse, so one stay.\n\nBut with one stay, I can be at y=9 at τ=10.\n\nFor example, stay at some point.\n\nBut to avoid the danger, I need to not be on y=4 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nIf I stay at τ=3, then y4=3 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, I need to go up or something.\n\nBut if I take U at τ=4, y5=4 at τ=5, which is dangerous.\n\nIf I take S again, but that would be second stay.\n\nWith only one stay, I cannot avoid both τ=4 and τ=5 for y=4.\n\nFor example, if I stay at τ=2, but at τ=2, I am at y=2, if I stay, y3=2 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, take U, y4=3 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, take U, y5=4 at τ=5, dangerous.\n\nIf at τ=4, take U to y5=4 at τ=5, collision.\n\nIf I go faster earlier, but from y=0, I can be at y=3 at τ=3 by going up, cannot be faster.\n\nSuppose I stay at τ=0, y1=0 at τ=1, then go up, but later.\n\nFor example, at τ=0: S, y1=0\n\nτ=1: U, y2=1\n\nτ=2: U, y3=2\n\nτ=3: U, y4=3\n\nThen at τ=4: need to not go to y=4 immediately, but if I take U, y5=4 at τ=5 dangerous.\n\nSame issue.\n\nAt τ=4, take S, y5=3, then τ=5: U, y6=4, but then I have two stays or one stay and one down, but with H=10, y10=9, I need net +9 in 10 steps, so if I have one stay, I can have eight U and one S, net +8, but need +9, so I must have nine U and one other, but if I have a D, net less, so must have nine U and one S? 9U and 1S: from 0, after 10 actions, y=9, since 9 up and one stay, but the stay doesn't change, so y increases by number of U minus number of D.\n\nSince no D, y increases by number of U.\n\nStart y0=0, after H actions, y_H = number of U minus number of D.\n\nSince y_H=9, and H actions, with U, D, S.\n\nLet U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, U + D + S = H.\n\ny_H = U - D =9.\n\nAlso, since I start at 0, and end at 9, U - D =9.\n\nNow, the path must avoid the dangers.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9 at τ=10, I need U - D =9, and U + D + S =10.\n\nSo U - D =9, U + D + S =10.\n\nSubtract: (U + D + S) - (U - D) =10 -9 => 2D + S =1.\n\nSo possible: D=0, S=1, then U=9.\n\nOr D=1, S=0, but 2(1) +0=2≠1, impossible.\n\nOr D=0, S=1, U=9.\n\nOr if S=1, D=0, U=9.\n\nSo only possibility: nine U and one S.\n\nNow, I need to place the S somewhere not causing issue.\n\nBut in the danger zone, I need to avoid being on y=4 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nτ=4 and τ=5 are times.\n\nNow, at τ=4, position y_4, I need to not be 4 if dangerous, but y=4 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, y=5 dangerous? y=5 dangerous only at τ=4.\n\nLet's list for each τ, the dangerous y.\n\nAt τ=3: y=4 dangerous\n\nτ=4: y=4,5,6,7,8 dangerous\n\nτ=5: y=4 dangerous (since freeway 4)\n\nτ=12,13,14: y=4 dangerous\n\nBut τ=12 later.\n\nNow for H=10, τ from 0 to 9 actions, positions from τ=0 to τ=10.\n\ny_τ for τ=0 to 10.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_10=9\n\nWith nine U and one S.\n\nThe S means at some point, y stays the same for one turn.\n\nTo avoid: at τ=4, y_4 should not be 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=4,5,6,7,8 all dangerous at τ=4 except possibly some, but all except lower.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, y_5 should not be 4.\n\nNow, suppose I place the S at some point.\n\nFor example, if I place S at τ=3, then y_4 = y_3 (since S at τ=3)\n\nNow, at τ=3, position y_3.\n\nIf y_3 <=3, then y_4 = y_3 <=3, so at τ=4, y_4 <=3, not 4-8, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I take U, so y_5 = y_4 +1 <=4.\n\nBut y_5 must not be 4 if τ=5 dangerous, but at τ=5, y=4 dangerous.\n\nSo if y_5=4, collision.\n\nNow, y_5 = y_4 +1 <=4.\n\nIf y_4 <=2, y_5 <=3, safe.\n\nIf y_4=3, y_5=4, dangerous.\n\nSo to avoid, I need y_4 <=2.\n\nBut y_4 = y_3 if S at τ=3.\n\ny_3: since I start from y0=0, go up.\n\nAt τ=0: U, y1=1\n\nτ=1: U, y2=2\n\nτ=2: U, y3=3\n\nThen if S at τ=3, y4=3\n\nThen at τ=4, y4=3, take U, y5=4\n\nAt τ=5, y5=4, dangerous.\n\nIf at τ=4, I take not U, but I have to take U eventually, but here I need to go to y=9, so I must take U most times.\n\nBut in this case, y5=4 at τ=5, collision.\n\nIf I place S earlier.\n\nSuppose S at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, take S, so y3 = y2\n\ny2: at τ=0 U, y1=1; τ=1 U, y2=2\n\nThen at τ=2, S, y3=2\n\nThen at τ=3, take U, y4=3\n\nAt τ=4, take U, y5=4\n\nAt τ=5, y5=4, dangerous? τ=5 position y5=4, and τ=5 dangerous for y=4, yes.\n\ny5=4 at τ=5.\n\nIf I take U at τ=4, y5=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, position y4=3, take U, y5=4.\n\nThen at τ=5, y5=4, dangerous.\n\nIf at τ=4, I take S, but I have only one S, if I use it at τ=2, then at τ=4 I must take U or something.\n\nBut with one S, I have to take U at other points.\n\nSuppose S at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, take S, so y5 = y4\n\nNow, y4: let's set the path.\n\nτ=0: U, y1=1\n\nτ=1: U, y2=2\n\nτ=2: U, y3=3\n\nτ=3: U, y4=4? But at τ=3, if I take U, y4=4, but τ=3, position y3=3, take U, so at τ=4, y4=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4 dangerous, collision immediately at τ=4.\n\nCannot take U at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, I must not take U to y=4.\n\nBut with no S yet, I have to take action.\n\nIf at τ=3, I take S, but I place S at τ=4, contradiction.\n\nI am placing one S.\n\nIf S at τ=4, then at τ=3, I must take U or D or S, but S is at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, position y3=3, if I take U, y4=4, then at τ=4, position y4=4, dangerous, collision.\n\nIf take D, y4=2, then at τ=4, take S (since S at τ=4), so y5=2\n\nThen I am lower, need to go up, but y5=2, then to reach y10=9, I need 7 more U in 5 actions, impossible since max increase 5.\n\ny5=2, after 5 actions to y10, max y10=7 if all U, but need 9, impossible.\n\nIf at τ=3, I take S, but S is at τ=4, so at τ=3 I take something else.\n\nCannot take S at τ=3 if S is placed at τ=4.\n\nThe S is at one specific τ.\n\nSuppose at τ=3 I take S, but if S is at τ=4, I take different.\n\nAssume S not at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y3=3, I must take action: if U, y4=4, collision at τ=4.\n\nIf D, y4=2, then at τ=4, take S (since S at τ=4), y5=2\n\nThen from y5=2 to y10=9 in 5 actions, need +7, but max +5, impossible.\n\nIf at τ=4 take not S, but I have to take S at τ=4.\n\nSince only one S.\n\nSo impossible to have H=10.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two S at turn 97 and 98 relative, but in absolute, turn 97 and 98.\n\nt_1=94.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: S\n\nTurn 98: S\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 103: U to y=7? Let's list positions to verify.\n\nTurn 94: pos y=0, take U, so next pos y=1\n\nTurn 95: pos y=1, take U, next y=2\n\nTurn 96: pos y=2, take U, next y=3\n\nTurn 97: pos y=3, take S, next y=3\n\nTurn 98: pos y=3, take S, next y=3\n\nTurn 99: pos y=3, take U, next y=4\n\nTurn 100: pos y=4, take U, next y=5\n\nTurn 101: pos y=5, take U, next y=6\n\nTurn 102: pos y=6, take U, next y=7\n\nTurn 103: pos y=7, take U, next y=8\n\nTurn 104: pos y=8, take U, next y=9 at turn 105.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at turn 100, position y=4, which is at relative time? Turn 100 is t_1 + 6, since 94+6=100, relative τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, which is safe, as we have.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there is also a car at (24,13,right,4), but we saw no future collision.\n\nAnd others.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5,6,7,8, at t=4, dangerous, but we not there.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 98, which is τ=4, I am at y=3, not on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nTurn 98: position y=3, as above.\n\nRelative τ=4, turn t_1 +4=98, position y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 is dangerous at τ=16-19, not now.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, with the sequence above.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn 94 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The car positions and movements are given at turn 94, and collisions occur if the player is on a freeway y at turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at T.\n\nThe dangerous times for each freeway, relative to turn 94 (i.e., τ = T - 94), are:\n- Freeway 1: τ = 16, 17, 18, 19\n- Freeway 2: τ = 16, 17, 18, 19\n- Freeway 3: τ = 16, 17, 18, 19\n- Freeway 4: τ = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 5: τ = 4\n- Freeway 6: τ = 4\n- Freeway 7: τ = 4\n- Freeway 8: τ = 4\n\nTo minimize the number of turns, the player should ascend as quickly as possible but must avoid being on y=4 at τ=4 or τ=5 due to collisions. The player also cannot be on y=5, y=6, y=7, or y=8 at τ=4. The minimal path requires 11 turns (H=11), with actions from turn 94 to turn 104, reaching y=9 at turn 105.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 94, move up (U) to y=1 at turn 95.\n- At turn 95, move up (U) to y=2 at turn 96.\n- At turn 96, move up (U) to y=3 at turn 97.\n- At turn 97, stay (S) to remain at y=3 at turn 98 (avoids being on y=4 at τ=4).\n- At turn 98, stay (S) to remain at y=3 at turn 99 (avoids being on y=4 at τ=5).\n- At turn 99, move up (U) to y=4 at turn 100 (safe at τ=6).\n- At turn 100, move up (U) to y=5 at turn 101 (safe, as τ=7 > 4).\n- At turn 101, move up (U) to y=6 at turn 102 (safe).\n- At turn 102, move up (U) to y=7 at turn 103 (safe).\n- At turn 103, move up (U) to y=8 at turn 104 (safe).\n- At turn 104, move up (U) to y=9 at turn 105.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At τ=4 (turn 98), the player is at y=3, which is safe (freeway 3 is not dangerous at τ=4).\n- At τ=5 (turn 99), the player is at y=3, safe.\n- The player is on y=4 only at τ=6 (turn 100), which is safe for freeway 4.\n- Other freeways are only dangerous at τ=4, and the player is not on them at that time.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns H is 11, with the action sequence as above.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 94: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 101: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 102: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 103: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 104: \\, U \\end{array} }",
