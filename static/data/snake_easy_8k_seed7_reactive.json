Move Up (U) to (3,4), then Right (R) to (4,4), then Right (R) to (5,4), then Down (D) to (5,3).\n   - This is a longer path but feasible.\n\n2. Move Down (D) to (3,2), then Right (R) to (4,2), then Right (R) to (5,2).\n   - But (5,2) is an obstacle! So this path is invalid.\n\n3. Move Left (L) to (2,3), then Up (U) to (2,4), then Right (R) to (3,4), etc.\n   - This seems convoluted and moves away from the food.\n\n### Immediate Decision\n\nGiven that we cannot move directly towards the closest food due to the no-instant-reverse rule, and moving Left or Up/Down doesn't immediately help, we need to choose a move that sets us up for future steps.\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,4) seems better because:\n  - It doesn't lead towards any obstacles.\n  - It allows us to change direction to Right in the next move, which can then be used to approach the food.\n\nMoving Down (D) is also safe but brings us closer to the obstacle at (5,2), which might limit future options.\n\nMoving Left (L) is safe but moves away from the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nSince the snake is only 1 segment long, there's no risk of body collision. The only dangers are walls and obstacles, which we've already considered.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the options, moving Up (U) seems the most strategic as it allows for more flexibility in the next moves to approach the food at (5,3).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Grid**: It's a 2D grid with borders at x=0, x=7 and y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n2. **Snake**: Currently, the snake is just a single segment at position (3, 4), moving upwards (\"U\").\n3. **Food Items**: There are four food items on the grid:\n   - (1, 1): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 3): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 6): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - (3, 4): value = 10, life_span = 1 (this is directly under the snake's head)\n\n### Analyzing the Snake's Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 4), moving upwards (\"U\"). The possible moves from here are:\n\n1. **Continue Up (U)**: New head position would be (3, 5).\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is the upper wall, so y=5 is safe.\n   - No body segments to collide with (snake is length 1).\n   - No food at (3, 5).\n\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: New head position would be (2, 4).\n   - Check walls: x=0 is the left wall, x=2 is safe.\n   - No body collision.\n   - No food at (2, 4).\n\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: New head position would be (4, 4).\n   - Check walls: x=7 is the right wall, x=4 is safe.\n   - No body collision.\n   - No food at (4, 4).\n\n4. **Reverse Down (D)**: Not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (\"U\").\n\n### Special Consideration: Food Under the Snake\n\nThere's food at (3, 4), which is exactly where the snake's head is. According to the rules:\n\n- Food under the snake's body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away (but the snake is length 1, so no body to move away).\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell (it's already on it).\n\nSince the snake is length 1, moving away would mean the head moves to a new position, and the tail (which is the same as the head currently) would move away, but since the head is no longer on the food, it can't be eaten in the next move. So, the food at (3, 4) cannot be eaten in this turn.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven that, let's evaluate the possible moves based on proximity to food and safety:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (3, 5)**:\n   - Next to food at (5, 6) but not directly accessible in one move.\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (2, 4)**:\n   - Moves towards the left side where food at (1, 1) is, but still two moves away (left then down).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (4, 4)**:\n   - Moves towards food at (5, 3) and (5, 6).\n   - Next move could be right to (5,4), then down to (5,3) or up to (5,5) -> (5,6).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\nAll moves are safe, but none immediately lead to food. The food at (3,4) can't be eaten now, and other foods are at least two moves away. \n\n### Considering Food Lifespans\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since we can't eat the food under us now, and other foods are too far to reach in one move, their life_spans will decrement to 0 after this turn, and they'll disappear. \n\nThus, in the next turn, all current foods will be gone, and new foods may spawn. \n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven that:\n\n- No move can reach food in one step.\n- All foods will disappear after this turn.\n- All possible moves are safe.\n\nThe best strategy is to choose a move that positions the snake towards areas where new food might spawn or keeps options open. \n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,5): central position, good for future flexibility.\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,4): closer to the left side, but not necessarily better.\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,4): closer to the right side where there's an obstacle at (5,2), but not directly affecting.\n\nSince all are equally safe and no immediate reward, I'll choose to continue upwards to keep the snake moving in the same direction, which is a common strategy to maintain simplicity unless there's a reason to turn.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- No walls in the path for U.\n- No body to collide with.\n- No food to accidentally trigger Tail Reward Danger (snake is length 1, so no tail).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest and most straightforward move is to continue upwards.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (cannot move to these coordinates).\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (5, 2) — a single wall inside the grid at this coordinate.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Only one segment at (3, 5), which means the snake is just its head with no body segments (length = 1).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (1, 1, 8, 1): Position (1,1), value=8, life_span=1.\n   - (5, 3, 8, 1): Position (5,3), value=8, life_span=1.\n   - (5, 6, 8, 1): Position (5,6), value=8, life_span=1.\n   - (3, 4, 9, 1): Position (3,4), value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: From (3,5) to (3,6).\n   - Check for walls: (3,6) is not a border wall (y=7 is the upper border), and there's no internal wall at (3,6). So, it's a valid move.\n   - Check for food: No food at (3,6).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (3,6), no food eaten, length remains 1.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: From (3,5) to (2,5).\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a border, (2,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check for food: No food at (2,5).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (2,5), no food eaten, length remains 1.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: From (3,5) to (4,5).\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is a border, (4,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check for food: No food at (4,5).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (4,5), no food eaten, length remains 1.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions:\n\n1. (1,1): Far from the snake's current position (3,5). Not immediately reachable.\n2. (5,3): To reach this, the snake would need to move right and then down, but it's not adjacent now.\n3. (5,6): Similarly, not adjacent.\n4. (3,4): This is directly below the snake's current position (3,5). \n\nHowever, the snake is currently moving Up (U), so to reach (3,4), it would need to reverse direction to Down (D), which is not allowed immediately (no instant reverse rule). \n\nBut wait, the snake's length is 1 (only head), so is the no-reverse rule still applicable? Typically, with length 1, reversing direction might be allowed since there's no body to collide with. However, the rules state \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn,\" which seems to apply regardless of length. So, Down (D) is not allowed.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nThe only food that's adjacent is (3,4), but we can't move Down to eat it immediately. The other foods are not adjacent, so no immediate eating is possible in this turn.\n\n### Evaluating Moves for Future Steps\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, the goal is to position the snake to potentially eat food in future turns while avoiding risks.\n\n- **Up (U)**: Moves to (3,6). Next possible moves from there would be U (to (3,7) which is a wall), L (to (2,6)), or R (to (4,6)). \n  - Moving U next would hit the wall, so not ideal.\n  - From (3,6), moving L or R could be safe, but no immediate food is nearby.\n\n- **Left (L)**: Moves to (2,5). Next possible moves: U (to (2,6)), D (to (2,4)), L (to (1,5)), R (to (3,5)).\n  - Moving L to (1,5) could eventually go towards (1,1) food, but it's several moves away.\n\n- **Right (R)**: Moves to (4,5). Next possible moves: U (to (4,6)), D (to (4,4)), L (to (3,5)), R (to (5,5)).\n  - Moving R to (5,5) could then go down to (5,3) food next, but that's two moves away.\n\nGiven that all moves are safe this turn, and no immediate food is available, the choice is somewhat neutral. However, moving Right (R) seems slightly better as it positions the snake closer to the food at (5,3) in future moves.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- The snake's length is 1, so no body collision is possible.\n- Wall collisions are already checked for each move.\n- No food is under the snake's body (since there is no body), so no \"Tail Reward Danger\" applies.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, moving Right (R) seems like a reasonable choice to position the snake towards the food at (5,3) in future turns, while avoiding immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The current direction is R (right), so the next possible moves are:\n\n- **Continue Right (R)**: Move to (5, 5)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: Move to (4, 6)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: Move to (4, 4)\n\n**Cannot move Left (L)** because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\n#### Evaluating Each Move:\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (5, 5)**:\n   - Check for walls: (5,5) is within borders (x=1-6, y=1-6), and not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check for food: No food at (5,5).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no score change.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4, 6)**:\n   - Check for walls: (4,6) is within borders.\n   - Check for food: No food at (4,6).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no score change.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4, 4)**:\n   - Check for walls: (4,4) is within borders.\n   - Check for food: There's food at (3,4), but not at (4,4).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no score change.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThe food items are:\n\n1. (1,1): Far from current position (4,5). Not reachable immediately.\n2. (5,3): Below and to the right. To reach it, the snake would need to move right then down.\n3. (5,6): Above and to the right. Move right then up.\n4. (3,4): To the left and down. Currently moving right, so would need to reverse direction, which is not allowed.\n\nGiven the current direction is R, the most promising food seems to be (5,3) and (5,6), but they're not adjacent. The immediate moves don't lead to any food.\n\n### Life Span Consideration\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn. However, since the countdown decreases every turn including the current one, after this move (turn 3), the life_span becomes 0, and the food disappears. \n\nBut since the action is applied **before** the countdown updates, the food is still present during the move. However, none of the adjacent cells have food, so eating isn't possible this turn.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nIf we move right to (5,5), next turn we could:\n- Move right to (6,5): No food, but closer to (5,6) if we go up next.\n- Move up to (5,6): Food at (5,6) with value 7. But since the snake's length is 1, eating it would make the length 2, and the tail would be at (5,5). Then, moving back down would cause a collision if the head tries to eat the tail's position's food, but that's not an immediate concern.\n\nAlternatively, moving up now to (4,6) doesn't help much, as the closest food is (5,6), which is still reachable next turn by moving right then up.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, and all foods will disappear after this turn, the best move is to continue in the current direction to keep options open for future moves.\n\n**Chosen Action**: Continue Right (R) to (5,5).\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\n- New head position: (5,5)\n- No walls or obstacles here.\n- No body segments to collide with.\n- Valid move.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The other moves don't result in eating any food this turn. Since all food has a life_span of 1, they will disappear after this turn, so it's now or never to eat them.\n\nThe food at (5,6) is positive (value=6), and eating it is safe because:\n- The snake is length 1, so no body collision.\n- After eating, the tail will be at (5,5), and head at (5,6), which are adjacent, but since the tail moves forward next turn, there's no immediate collision risk.\n\nOther food items:\n- (1,1): Too far, not reachable in one move.\n- (5,3): Requires moving Down twice, not possible now.\n- (3,4): Not reachable in one move.\n- (5,1): Requires moving Down four times, not possible now.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions\n\nFor the move Up (U) to (5,6):\n- No walls or obstacles at (5,6).\n- No body segments to collide with (snake length is 1).\n- Food is present and can be eaten safely.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nWhile not required for the immediate action, it's good to think ahead:\n- After moving Up and eating, the snake will be at [(5,6), (5,5)].\n- Next moves would need to avoid moving back into (5,5) unless the tail moves away.\n\nBut since the task is to decide the immediate action, this is just for completeness.\n\n### Eliminating Other Options\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (6,5): Safe but no food, missed opportunity.\n- Moving Down (D) to (5,4): Safe but no food, missed opportunity.\n- Moving Left (L): Not allowed (opposite of current direction R).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here since the snake is length 1; no tail to collide with after growth.\n- **Food under body**: Not applicable since the snake is only a head.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the positive food at (5,6), maximizing the score by +6 and increasing the snake's length safely.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: (5, 2) is a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5, 6), body at (5, 5).\n   - Direction: Currently moving Up (\"U\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 1): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (5, 3): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (3, 4): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (5, 1): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 6) moving Up (\"U\"), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 7) → y=7 is a wall → **Invalid** (collision)\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 5) → This is the current body segment → **Invalid** (would collide with body)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 6) → Need to check if this is valid.\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 6) → Need to check if this is valid.\n\nSince we can't reverse direction instantly (from U to D is not allowed), the only possible moves are Left (L) or Right (R).\n\n### Checking Left (L) to (4, 6)\n\n- Is (4, 6) a wall? \n  - Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls; x=4 is not.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5, 2) is the only one; (4, 6) is not listed.\n  - So, not a wall.\n- Is (4, 6) occupied by the snake's body?\n  - Snake body is at (5, 5). (4, 6) is not part of the body.\n- Is there food at (4, 6)?\n  - Checking food positions: (1,1), (5,3), (3,4), (5,1) → No food at (4,6).\n- **Conclusion**: Moving Left is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Checking Right (R) to (6, 6)\n\n- Is (6, 6) a wall?\n  - x=6 is not a border wall (x=7 is).\n  - Internal obstacles: (5, 2) is the only one; (6, 6) is not listed.\n  - So, not a wall.\n- Is (6, 6) occupied by the snake's body?\n  - Snake body is at (5, 5). (6, 6) is not part of the body.\n- Is there food at (6, 6)?\n  - Checking food positions: No food at (6,6).\n- **Conclusion**: Moving Right is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, the snake can't reach any food in one move from (5,6):\n- (1,1): Too far.\n- (5,3): Below the head; can't move Down (D) because it's reverse and body is there.\n- (3,4): Left and down; can't reach in one move.\n- (5,1): Below; same issue as (5,3).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (5,5). Is there positive food adjacent to the head (5,6) that's also at the tail?\n- Adjacent cells to head (5,6):\n  - Up: (5,7) - wall\n  - Down: (5,5) - tail\n  - Left: (4,6)\n  - Right: (6,6)\n- Food at tail (5,5)? Checking food positions: No food at (5,5).\n- So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nAll foods have life_span=1 at turn 5, meaning they'll disappear at the end of turn 5 (after this move). But since we can't reach any in this move, it doesn't affect our decision.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Right\n\nBoth Left and Right are safe moves with no immediate food to eat. We can choose either. \n\nLooking ahead slightly:\n- If we go Left to (4,6), next moves could be:\n  - Left again to (3,6)\n  - Down to (4,5)\n  - Up to (4,7) - wall\n- If we go Right to (6,6), next moves could be:\n  - Right to (7,6) - wall\n  - Down to (6,5)\n  - Up to (6,7) - wall\n\nGoing Left seems better because it leaves more open space for future moves (right leads towards the wall at x=7).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic move is to go **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Left (L) to (3, 6)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - **Walls**: x=3 is within bounds (0 to 7), y=6 is within bounds. No internal wall at (3, 6).\n  - **Body**: The only body segment is at (5, 6), so no collision.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (3, 6).\n- **Safety**: Safe move; no immediate risks.\n- **Future Implications**: Moves away from the body segment, keeping options open.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 7)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - y=7 is a border wall. Moving here would cause a wall collision.\n- **Safety**: Deadly move; would kill the snake.\n- **Conclusion**: Not viable.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 5)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - **Walls**: x=4, y=5 are within bounds. No internal wall at (4, 5).\n  - **Body**: No body segment at (4, 5).\n- **Food Check**: No food at (4, 5).\n- **Safety**: Safe move; no immediate risks.\n- **Future Implications**: Moves downward, away from the current body segment.\n\n### Comparing Left (L) and Down (D)\n\nBoth Left and Down are safe moves with no immediate food benefits. We need to consider which move positions the snake better for future food collection.\n\n- **Left to (3, 6)**:\n  - Distance to nearest foods:\n    - (3, 4): distance = |3-3| + |6-4| = 2\n    - (5, 3): distance = |3-5| + |6-3| = 5\n    - (1, 1): distance = |3-1| + |6-1| = 7\n    - (5, 1): distance = |3-5| + |6-1| = 7\n  - Closest food is (3, 4) with value 5, distance 2.\n\n- **Down to (4, 5)**:\n  - Distance to nearest foods:\n    - (3, 4): distance = |4-3| + |5-4| = 2\n    - (5, 3): distance = |4-5| + |5-3| = 3\n    - (1, 1): distance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 7\n    - (5, 1): distance = |4-5| + |5-1| = 5\n  - Closest foods are (3, 4) and (5, 3) with distances 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nBoth moves have a food at distance 2:\n- Left: (3, 4)\n- Down: (3, 4)\n\nHowever, moving Down also brings us closer to (5, 3), which is another food option. \n\nAdditionally, moving Down may open up more options in the next move since we're moving towards the center of the grid where more food is located.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to ensure that moving to a new position doesn't set up a situation where the head is adjacent to the tail with positive food under the tail that could be eaten in the next move, causing a collision.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (5, 6). After any move, the tail will move to where the body was, which is (4, 6) if we move Left or Down.\n\n- If we move Left to (3, 6), new tail is at (4, 6). Head at (3, 6) is adjacent to tail at (4, 6) (left and right). No food is at (4, 6), so no danger.\n- If we move Down to (4, 5), new tail is at (4, 6). Head at (4, 5) is adjacent to tail at (4, 6) (up and down). No food is at (4, 6), so no danger.\n\nNo tail reward danger in either case.\n\n### Life Span of Foods\n\nAll foods have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. However, none of the immediate moves lead to eating food, so their life spans don't affect this decision directly.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth Left and Down are safe, but Down seems slightly better because:\n- It moves towards more food options in the center.\n- It doesn't corner the snake as much as moving Left might (moving Left could eventually lead to being stuck near the left wall).\n\nHowever, moving Left is also safe and positions the snake closer to (3, 4), which is a high-value food (value 5). \n\nGiven that both are equally safe and have similar proximity to food, but Down offers more central positioning, I'll choose Down to maintain flexibility.\n\nBut wait, moving Left to (3, 6) would make the next move towards (3, 4) straightforward (Down to (3, 5), then Down to (3, 4)), whereas moving Down to (4, 5) would require moving Left to (3, 5) then Down to (3, 4), which is the same number of moves but with more options from (4,5).\n\nGiven that, both are equally good, but since the snake is currently at the top (y=6), moving Down is generally better to explore more of the grid.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nAfter careful consideration, both moves are safe and have merits. I'll choose to move **Down** to (4, 5) to explore more central areas of the grid where food is located.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Layout**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7). There are borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the snake cannot move outside these bounds. Additionally, there's an internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n2. **Snake State**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake consists of two segments: head at (4, 5) and tail at (4, 6).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving **Down (D)**, meaning its last move was from (4, 6) to (4, 5).\n\n3. **Food Items**: There are five food items on the grid, each with their position, value, and remaining lifespan:\n   - (1, 1): value=3, lifespan=1\n   - (5, 3): value=3, lifespan=1\n   - (3, 4): value=4, lifespan=1\n   - (5, 1): value=7, lifespan=1\n   - (6, 3): value=10, lifespan=1\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is moving Down (D), the next move cannot be Up (U), as that would be an instant reverse.\n- **Possible Moves**: Left (L), Right (R), or continue Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move (L, R, D) based on safety (avoiding collisions) and potential rewards (eating positive food).\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D)\n- **New Head Position**: (4, 5) → (4, 4)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=4 is within bounds (y=0 to y=7).\n  - **Obstacles**: (5, 2) is not in the path.\n  - **Body**: The tail is at (4, 6), which will move to (4, 5) after this move, so no collision.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (4, 4)? No.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- **New Head Position**: (4, 5) → (3, 5)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=3 is within bounds.\n  - **Obstacles**: No obstacle at (3, 5).\n  - **Body**: Tail moves to (4, 5), but head is at (3, 5), so no collision.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (3, 5)? No.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- **New Head Position**: (4, 5) → (5, 5)\n- **Check Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=5 is within bounds.\n  - **Obstacles**: No obstacle at (5, 5).\n  - **Body**: Tail moves to (4, 5), head at (5, 5), no collision.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (5, 5)? No.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Future Moves and Food\n\nAll immediate moves (D, L, R) are safe but don't lead to food. However, some food items are nearby and may be reachable in future turns. Let's see:\n\n1. **Food at (3, 4)**:\n   - Current position: (4, 5).\n   - To reach (3, 4), we can:\n     - Move Left to (3, 5), then Down to (3, 4).\n   - But food lifespan is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So, we can't reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 3)**:\n   - From (4, 5), possible path:\n     - Right to (5, 5), then Down to (5, 4), then Down to (5, 3).\n   - Lifespan is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Can't reach in time.\n\n3. **Food at (6, 3)**:\n   - From (4, 5), it's too far, and lifespan is 10, but immediate moves don't help.\n\n4. **Food at (5, 1)**:\n   - Similar to above, too far for immediate action.\n\n5. **Food at (1, 1)**:\n   - Very far, lifespan is 1, can't reach.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake's tail is at (4, 6). The head is at (4, 5). The tail is adjacent to the head (directly below). However, there's no food at the tail's position (4, 6), so the \"Tail Reward Danger\" doesn't apply here.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food (and the nearby food will disappear before we can reach them), the priority is to stay safe and position the snake for future opportunities.\n\n- **Move Down (D)**: Leads to (4, 4). Safe, but doesn't open up new paths.\n- **Move Left (L)**: Leads to (3, 5). From here, next turn could move Down to (3, 4) where food was (but it's gone now), or Left/Right.\n- **Move Right (R)**: Leads to (5, 5). From here, next turn could move Down to (5, 4), then Down to (5, 3) where food was (but it's gone now).\n\nGiven that all moves are safe but don't lead to immediate rewards, I might consider which move keeps the snake in a more central position for future food spawns.\n\n**Choosing Right (R)** seems reasonable as it moves the snake towards the center-right of the grid, where some high-value foods were located (though they're disappearing now, new ones might spawn).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move is to go **Right (R)**, as it avoids immediate danger and positions the snake in a more central location for potential future food.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

If we move down to (5,4), next move could be down to (5,3) to eat it.\n   - Current life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - But since we're at turn 8, and life_span decreases every turn, it will disappear at turn 9 if not eaten now.\n   - To eat it now, we'd need to be at (5,4) and move to (5,3), but we're at (5,5). So, not directly possible this turn.\n3. **(3,4)**: Left and up, not directly accessible.\n4. **(5,1)**: Below, but blocked by (5,2) which is an obstacle.\n5. **(6,3)**: To the right and down.

Thus, we can't reach it in one move. **Not reachable**.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 3)**:\n   - **Value**: 1.\n   - **Life Span**: 1 → Disappears after this turn.\n   - **Current Position**: (6, 5).\n   - **Path**: \n     - First move D → (6, 4).\n     - Second move L → (5, 4).\n     - Third move D → (5, 3).\n   - **Not reachable** in one move.\n\n3. **Food at (5, 1)**:\n   - **Value**: 5.\n   - **Life Span**: 1 → Disappears after this turn.\n   - **Path**: \n     - First move D → (6, 4).\n     - Second move L → (5, 4).\n     - Third move D → (5, 3).\n     - Fourth move D → (5, 2) → Obstacle → **Invalid**.\n   - **Not reachable**.\n\n4. **Food at (3, 4)**:\n   - **Value**: 2.\n   - **Life Span**: 1 → Disappears after this turn.\n   - **Path**: \n     - First move L → (5, 5).\n     - But L is opposite to current direction R → **Invalid** (no instant reverse).\n     - First move U → (6, 6).\n     - Second move L → (5, 6).\n     - Third move L → (4, 6).\n     - Fourth move D → (4, 5).\n     - Fifth move L → (3, 5).\n     - Sixth move D → (3, 4).\n   - **Not reachable** in one move.\n\n5. **Food at (1, 1)**:\n   - **Value**: 1.\n   - **Life Span**: 1 → Disappears after this turn.\n   - **Path**: \n     - Too far → **Not reachable** in one move.\n\n### Conclusion on Food Accessibility\n\nNone of the food items can be reached in a single move, given their life spans. Therefore, the immediate goal should be to position the snake for future food collection while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nGiven that no food is immediately accessible, the best move is to ensure the snake remains safe and positions itself for future opportunities.\n\n- **Move Up (U)**: \n  - New head at (6, 6).\n  - Safe and keeps options open.\n- **Move Down (D)**:\n  - New head at (6, 4).\n  - Safe and moves towards the center, but no immediate benefit.\n\n**Decision**: Both U and D are safe, but U moves the snake towards the upper part of the grid, which might be less explored. However, since no food is immediately available, either is acceptable.\n\nBut, looking at the food positions, (6, 3) is below. If we move D, we might be able to reach it in the next turn if new food spawns or existing food remains. However, (6, 3) has a life span of 1, so it's gone next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince no food is reachable in one move, and both U and D are safe, I'll choose **U** to explore the upper part of the grid, which might have more opportunities.\n\nBut, looking again, the food at (6, 3) is the most valuable. Even though it's not reachable now, moving D might position the snake better for future turns.\n\nHowever, given the life span constraints, it's better to choose a move that keeps the snake safe and flexible.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Move U**: (6, 6)\n  - Next turn, the snake can move L, R, or U (if not hitting walls).\n- **Move D**: (6, 4)\n  - Next turn, the snake can move L, R, or D.\n\nBoth options are safe, but U might be better to avoid getting stuck near the bottom wall.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest and most strategic move is **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — can't move here.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (6, 6), body at (6, 5).\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5, 3): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (3, 4): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (5, 1): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (6, 3): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6, 1): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6, 6) moving Up (U), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (6, 6) → (6, 7)\n  - But y=7 is a border wall → collision → invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (6, 6) → (6, 5)\n  - Current body is at (6, 5). Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves forward, but here the snake's length is 2 (head and one body segment). After moving down:\n    - New head: (6, 5)\n    - Tail was at (6, 5), which moves away (original tail was at (6,5), but since the head moves to (6,5), the tail would have to move to where the head was, but this seems like it would cause a collision. Wait, let's think:\n    - Current: head (6,6), body (6,5)\n    - Move D: head to (6,5), body was at (6,5) moves to (6,6) — so new snake is [(6,5), (6,6)]\n    - Now head is at (6,5), body at (6,6) — no immediate collision.\n    - But is this allowed? Normally, moving into the tail is okay if the tail moves away, but here the snake is length 2, so moving down would swap head and tail positions, which might not be a collision, but is it useful? Probably not, since no food is there.\n- **Left (L)**: (6, 6) → (5, 6)\n  - Check walls: no wall at (5,6).\n  - Check body: body is at (6,5), so no collision.\n  - Valid move.\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 6) → (7, 6)\n  - x=7 is a border wall → collision → invalid.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: Down (D) and Left (L).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Down (D) to (6,5)**\n- No food at (6,5).\n- After move:\n  - Head: (6,5), body: (6,6)\n- Next possible moves from (6,5):\n  - Can't reverse to Up (U) (from D to U is opposite, but current direction is U, moving D is allowed since it's not opposite to U? Wait, current direction is U, and we're choosing next move. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so next move cannot be D. But we're moving now, so is current direction the last move's direction? Or is it the direction the head is facing? Probably the latter. So current direction is U, meaning the head is pointing up. Then moving D is opposite to U, which is not allowed. So D is invalid because it's an instant reverse.\n  \nWait, the rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\nCurrent direction is U (up), so opposite is D (down). So cannot move D next. So D is invalid in this case.\n\nSo only possible move is Left (L).\n\n**Option 2: Left (L) to (5,6)**\n- Check for food at (5,6): No food listed there.\n- After move:\n  - Head: (5,6), body: (6,6)\n- No collision, no wall.\n- Next possible moves from (5,6):\n  - Current direction would be L (since we moved left).\n  - Cannot move R (opposite).\n  - Can move U, D, or L.\n  \nBut is moving L the best option now? Let's see if any food is reachable soon.\n\n### Looking at Food\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (5,3): value=1, life=1\n   - Distance from (6,6): Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - To reach (5,3) from (6,6):\n     - Need to go left to (5,6), then down to (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) — 3 moves.\n     - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So at turn 10, life=1, at turn 11 it's gone. So cannot reach it in time.\n2. (3,4): value=1, life=1\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n   - Life=1, disappears next turn — cannot reach.\n3. (5,1): value=1, life=4\n   - Distance: |6-5| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n   - Life=4: can reach in 6 moves, but disappears in 4 — cannot reach.\n4. (6,3): value=1, life=7\n   - Distance: |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n   - Life=7: can reach in 3 moves (e.g., D to (6,5), D to (6,4), D to (6,3)).\n   - So possible to reach before it disappears.\n5. (6,1): value=1, life=10\n   - Distance: |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n   - Life=10: can reach in 5 moves (D,D,D,D,D).\n\nSo the only reachable foods are (6,3) and (6,1), both positive.\n\n### Planning Path to Food\n\nFrom current (6,6), head direction U.\n\nTo reach (6,3):\n- Need to move down three times: D, D, D.\n- But first move cannot be D (instant reverse from U).\n- So first move must be L to (5,6).\n- Then from (5,6), can move D to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then L to (6,4), etc. — seems longer.\nAlternatively, after first L to (5,6), maybe can go L to (4,6), etc., but not directly helping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe no immediate food is reachable in the next move, so just move safely.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is adjacent to the tail:\n- Tail is at (6,5).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,5), (7,5), (6,4), (6,6) (but (6,6) is head).\n- Food at (6,3) is not adjacent to tail.\n- Food at (6,1) is not adjacent to tail.\n- Other foods are not adjacent.\nSo no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven that:\n- Cannot move D (instant reverse).\n- Moving U hits wall.\n- Moving R hits wall.\n- Only valid move is L to (5,6).\n- Moving L does not eat food immediately but is safe and opens up future paths.\n\nNo immediate food can be eaten this turn, so prioritize safety.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only valid and safe move is Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the snake cannot move outside these borders.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (5, 2) is a wall cell that the snake cannot pass through.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (5, 6), body segment at (6, 6).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (3, 4): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 1): value = 3, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 3): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 1): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Snake's Possible Movements\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - **Allowed Directions**: U, D, L\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move based on the current state.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - Current Direction\n   - **New Head Position**: (5 - 1, 6) = (4, 6)\n   - **Check for Collisions**:\n     - **Walls**: (4,6) is not a wall (x=4 is within 0-7, y=6 is within 0-7).\n     - **Body**: The body is at (6,6), so no collision.\n   - **Food Check**: Is there food at (4,6)? No food is listed there.\n   - **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n   - **New Head Position**: (5, 6 + 1) = (5, 7)\n   - **Check for Collisions**:\n     - **Walls**: y=7 is a border wall. **Collision!**\n   - **Result**: Deadly move, avoid.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n   - **New Head Position**: (5, 6 - 1) = (5, 5)\n   - **Check for Collisions**:\n     - **Walls**: (5,5) is not a wall.\n     - **Body**: The body is at (6,6), no collision.\n   - **Food Check**: Is there food at (5,5)? No food listed.\n   - **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial in the immediate next move:\n\n1. **(3,4)**: value=1, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (5,6): Manhattan distance = |5-3| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n2. **(5,1)**: value=3, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n3. **(6,3)**: value=6, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n4. **(6,1)**: value=9, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\nNone of the food items can be eaten in the immediate next move, so the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future food collection.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nWhile we can't reach food immediately, let's think about positioning:\n\n- Moving Left to (4,6) or Down to (5,5) are safe.\n- Moving Left keeps the head at y=6, moving towards the left side where there's food at (3,4), but it's still far.\n- Moving Down to (5,5) might open up paths towards other foods like (6,3) or (5,1) in future moves.\n\nHowever, since the food at (3,4) has a life_span of 1, it will disappear after this turn, so it's not a target anymore. Similarly, (5,1), (6,3), and (6,1) have life_span=1, so they'll disappear after this turn as well. This means all current food will be gone after this turn, and new food will spawn (though we don't have info about that).\n\nGiven that, the immediate move doesn't affect food consumption, so we should just avoid collisions.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake's tail is at (6,6). The head is at (5,6), moving Left to (4,6). The tail is adjacent to the head (right next to it at (6,6)), but there's no food at (6,6), so no danger of tail reward collision.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Down\n\nBoth Left and Down are safe moves with no immediate food benefit. \n\n- **Left (L)**: Moves towards the left edge, but no food there now.\n- **Down (D)**: Moves towards the bottom, where there's an internal wall at (5,2), but that's three steps away.\n\nGiven that, both are equally safe, but moving Down might be slightly better as it opens up more options in the vertical direction for future moves when new food appears.\n\nHowever, since all food is disappearing, and no immediate benefit, either is fine. But since the snake was moving Left, continuing Left is also reasonable unless there's a reason to change direction.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Moving Left is safe and maintains current direction.\n- Moving Down is also safe but changes direction.\n- No immediate food to target.\n- No preference based on future food (since current food disappears).\n\nI'll choose to continue Left to maintain the current path unless there's a reason to change, which there isn't here.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (5, 2) is a wall inside the grid.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (4, 6), body segment at (5, 6).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5, 1): value = 3, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 3): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 1): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since it's currently moving Left (L), it cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - Current Direction\n- New head position: (4 - 1, 6) = (3, 6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is at x=0, (3,6) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Snake body is at (5,6), new head is at (3,6) - no collision.\n- **Food**: No food at (3,6).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (4, 6 + 1) = (4, 7)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is a wall - moving to (4,7) would collide with the wall.\n- **Outcome**: Deadly collision - invalid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (4, 6 - 1) = (4, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is at y=0, (4,5) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Snake body is at (5,6), new head is at (4,5) - no collision.\n- **Food**: No food at (4,5).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R) - Reverse Direction\n- Not allowed since it's the opposite of current direction (L).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nCurrently, the snake is at [(4,6), (5,6)]. The foods are at:\n1. (5,1): value=3, life_span=1\n2. (6,3): value=5, life_span=1\n3. (6,1): value=8, life_span=1\n\nNone of these foods are adjacent to the current head position (4,6). The closest is (5,1), which is 5 units away in x and 5 in y, not adjacent.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, the immediate goal is to position the snake to reach food safely in future turns. \n\nLooking at the current possible safe moves:\n- Left (L) to (3,6)\n- Down (D) to (4,5)\n\nBetween these, moving Down might be better because:\n- Moving Left takes us further from the foods which are mostly on the right side (x=5,6).\n- Moving Down could help in aligning to reach foods at lower y coordinates (foods are at y=1,3).\n\nHowever, moving Left is also safe and keeps options open.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (5,6). The head is at (4,6). They are adjacent (left of head is tail). However, the tail does not have any food on it (no food is at (5,6)), so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Life Span of Foods\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since none are adjacent, they will disappear next turn regardless of our move.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- No food is immediately accessible.\n- All foods will disappear next turn.\n- Both Left and Down are safe moves.\n- Moving Down may position us better for future food spawns in lower y coordinates.\n\nHowever, since foods are disappearing, immediate food access isn't a factor. Both moves are equally safe in terms of current state.\n\nGiven no immediate benefit, and to keep options open, moving Left is as good as Down. But since moving Down might align better with future movements towards where foods were (lower y), let's choose Down.\n\nBut actually, since foods are disappearing, and no immediate gain, either move is fine. Maybe moving Left keeps us closer to the center.\n\nAlternatively, since the snake is short (length 2), and no immediate threats, either move is safe. \n\nGiven that, and to avoid walls, Down seems slightly better as it moves away from the top wall.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest move is Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake has two segments: head at (4, 5) and tail at (4, 6).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Down (D), meaning the previous move was downward (from (4, 6) to (4, 5)).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (5, 1): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 3): value = 4, 1\n   - (6, 1): value = 7, 1\n   - (2, 2): value = 10, 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (3, 5)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (5, 5)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (4, 4)\n  \nCannot move Up (U) because that would be an instant reverse (from Down to Up), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1.

Current body segments are at (4,5) and (4,6). No collision.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (3, 5).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moves away from most food items.

Move Right (R) to (5, 5)\n- **Safety Check**:\n  - (5, 5) is not a wall (walls at x=0,7; y=0,7; and (5,2)).\n  - Not occupied by body.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (5, 5).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moves towards the right side where some food is located (e.g., (5,1), (6,3), (6,1)).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 4)\n- **Safety Check**:\n  - (4, 4) is not a wall.\n  - Not occupied by body.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (4, 4).\n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moves downward, towards the food at (5,1) and (6,1).\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nLet's look at the food items more closely:\n\n1. **(5, 1)**: value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (4,5): |5-4| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n   - Will disappear after this turn (life_span decreases to 0 next turn).\n\n2. **(6, 3)**: value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Also disappears after this turn.\n\n3. **(6, 1)**: value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6\n   - Disappears after this turn.\n\n4. **(2, 2)**: value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |2-4| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Disappears after this turn.\n\nAll food will disappear after this turn, so we need to reach one of them this turn to eat it. However, none of the immediate next positions (from possible moves) have food. \n\nThis means we cannot eat any food this turn, regardless of the move. Therefore, the primary goal is to position ourselves for future opportunities while avoiding immediate dangers.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nAre any moves leading to a dead end or immediate danger next turn?\n\n- **Left to (3,5)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (3,5): L (2,5), R (4,5), D (3,4)\n    - (4,5) is current head position, which will be the tail next turn, so moving back is safe unless the tail has food (which it doesn't currently).\n  \n- **Right to (5,5)**:\n  - Next moves: L (4,5), R (6,5), D (5,4)\n    - (4,5) will be tail, safe.\n  \n- **Down to (4,4)**:\n  - Next moves: L (3,4), R (5,4), D (4,3)\n    - All safe.\n\nNo immediate dangers in any move.\n\n### Future Food Accessibility\n\nSince all current food disappears after this turn, new food will spawn next turn. We should position ourselves to be near the center or areas where food is likely to spawn, but since we don't have info on spawn mechanics, we can aim for moves that keep us flexible.\n\nMoving Right or Down seems better as they move us towards areas where current food was (right side and bottom), possibly where new food may appear.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (4,6). For tail reward danger to occur, the head must be adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell must have positive food. Currently, the head is at (4,5), tail at (4,6), so they are adjacent (directly below). However, the tail cell (4,6) does not have food, so no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince no move allows eating food this turn, and all moves are safe, we can choose a move that positions us better for future turns. Moving Right seems advantageous as it moves towards where higher-value foods were (right side), possibly keeping us in a good position for new food spawns.\n\nHowever, moving Down also moves us towards the bottom where some food was. Both are safe, but moving Right might be slightly better as it doesn't reduce our y-coordinate further (we're already at y=5, moving down to y=4).\n\nAlternatively, moving Left is safe but moves us away from where most food was. \n\nBetween Right and Down, Right seems slightly better as it keeps us more central in the y-axis.\n\n### Verifying Right Move\n\nIf we move Right to (5,5):\n- Next turn, tail moves to (4,5), so snake is [(5,5), (4,5)].\n- Possible next moves from (5,5): L (4,5) - but that's the tail, which will have moved, so it's safe; R (6,5); D (5,4); U (5,6) - but current direction is R, so cannot go L next turn unless we change direction now.\n\nActually, current direction is D, and we're choosing R, so next turn's possible directions would be L, R, D (no U because that would reverse from D to U via R, which isn't instant reverse, but the current move is R, so next turn's direction is R, so cannot go L (opposite of R is L, which would be instant reverse). Wait, need to clarify direction changes.\n\nCurrent direction is D. If we choose R, the new direction is R, so next turn cannot go L (opposite of R). \n\nSimilarly, if we choose D, next turn cannot go U.\n\nIf we choose L, next turn cannot go R.\n\nThis doesn't affect immediate safety but is good to note for future planning.\n\nGiven that, all moves are still safe, and Right seems optimal.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what the constraints are.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: These are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (5, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake has two segments:\n     - Head at (5, 5)\n     - Body segment at (4, 5)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (5, 1): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 3\n   - (6, 1): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - (2, 2): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\nAll food items have a positive value (+1), so there's no negative food in this scenario.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot immediately go Left (L) in the next move. So, L is invalid.\n   \n   Valid moves from R: U, D, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - **Right (R)**: Move to (6, 5). \n     - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=6 is not. No internal obstacle at (6,5). \n     - Valid.\n   - **Up (U)**: Move to (5, 6).\n     - Check walls: y=7 is a wall, y=6 is not. No internal obstacle at (5,6).\n     - Valid.\n   - **Down (D)**: Move to (5, 4).\n     - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, y=4 is not. No internal obstacle at (5,4).\n     - Valid.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if any of these moves lead to food:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (6,5)**:\n   - Check food at (6,5): No food listed at this position.\n   - So, no food eaten here.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (5,6)**:\n   - Check food at (5,6): No food listed.\n   - No food eaten.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check food at (5,4): No food listed.\n   - No food eaten.\n\nNone of the immediate moves lead to food. So, we need to consider future moves to maximize score.\n\n### Considering Future Moves to Reach Food\n\nLet's look at the positions of the food and see which moves might help us reach them soonest:\n\n1. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Current head at (5,5). To reach (5,1), need to move down four times.\n   - Life_span = 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current).\n   - So, it's impossible to reach this food in time. Ignore.\n\n2. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - From (5,5), possible path: Right to (6,5), then Down twice to (6,3).\n   - Life_span = 3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns (including current).\n   - Need to reach it in 2 moves (since first move is current turn, then next two).\n   - Possible: R then D D. But need to ensure no collisions.\n   - First move R to (6,5), then D to (6,4), then D to (6,3).\n   - Check if (6,4) is safe: No walls or obstacles. Snake body will be at (5,5) and (4,5) moves to (5,5), so (6,4) is safe.\n   - Then (6,3): Need to check if eating this causes tail collision.\n     - After moving to (6,3), snake will be [(6,3), (6,5), (5,5)].\n     - Next move, tail moves to (6,5), so no collision.\n   - So, this is a viable path to get the food at (6,3).\n\n3. **Food at (6,1)**:\n   - Life_span = 6, so we have more time. Lower priority than (6,3) which disappears sooner.\n\n4. **Food at (2,2)**:\n   - Life_span = 9, so even more time. Lower priority.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail is at (4,5).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (3,5), (5,5), (4,6), (4,4).\n- Head is at (5,5), which is adjacent to tail (4,5).\n- Is there food at tail (4,5)? No, food is at other positions.\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven that the food at (6,3) is the most urgent (life_span=3), let's see how to reach it:\n\n1. First move: Right to (6,5).\n   - Next turn, move Down to (6,4).\n   - Then, move Down to (6,3) to eat the food.\n\nAlternatively, if we move Down now to (5,4), it doesn't help reach any food quickly.\n\nMoving Up to (5,6) also doesn't seem to help reach any food soon.\n\nSo, moving Right seems the best to start the path towards (6,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore deciding on Right, let's ensure it's safe:\n\n- Moving Right to (6,5):\n  - Next head position: (6,5).\n  - Current body: [(5,5), (4,5)].\n  - After move, body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)].\n  - No collision with body (since (5,5) is the first body segment, and head moves to (6,5)).\n  - No wall or obstacle at (6,5).\n  - Safe.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to move Right?\n\n- Moving Right doesn't lead to immediate food, but sets up for future food.\n- Moving Up or Down also don't lead to immediate food, and don't seem to set up better paths.\n- Moving Down to (5,4) might be safer in terms of keeping options open, but doesn't help with immediate food.\n\nGiven that (6,3) is the most urgent food, starting the path towards it seems optimal.\n\n### Verifying Other Food\n\nFood at (6,1) is also reachable from (6,5) by moving Down multiple times, but (6,3) is more urgent.\n\nFood at (2,2) is too far and not urgent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right to start the path towards the food at (6,3), which is the most urgent due to its short life span.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 15.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't go beyond these coordinates.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (6, 5), body at (5, 5). So, the snake is two segments long.\n   - Current direction: Right (R). This means the last move was to the right.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6, 3): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (6, 1): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (2, 2): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6, 5), and given the last move was Right (R), the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (6, 5) → (6, 6)\n- **Down (D)**: (6, 5) → (6, 4)\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 5) → (7, 5)\n- **Left (L)**: (6, 5) → (5, 5)\n\nBut we have to consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Left (L) because that would be opposite to the current direction (R).\n  \nSo, valid moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6, 6)\n   - Check walls: y=7 is a wall, so y=6 is allowed (not a wall).\n   - Check body: Current body is at (5,5). (6,6) is not on the body.\n   - Food: No food at (6,6).\n   - After move: Head moves to (6,6), tail moves from (5,5) to (6,5). New positions: [(6,6), (6,5)].\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (6, 4)\n   - Walls: y=0 is wall, y=4 is fine.\n   - Body: (5,5) is not at (6,4).\n   - Food: No food at (6,4).\n   - After move: Head at (6,4), tail at (6,5). New positions: [(6,4), (6,5)].\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (7, 5)\n   - Walls: x=7 is a wall. So, moving right would hit the wall → death.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: U, D.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food safely with these moves.\n\n**Food at (6,3)**:\n- Current head at (6,5). To reach (6,3), need to go down twice.\n- Next move D: head to (6,4). Then next turn could go D to (6,3).\n- But food's life_span=3. It's turn 15 now, so it disappears at turn 15 + 3 = turn 18.\n- We can reach it by turn 17 (move D at 15 to (6,4), then D at 16 to (6,3), eat at turn 16.\n- But we're deciding for turn 15. Moving D at 15 gets us closer.\n\n**Food at (6,1)**:\n- Life_span=5, so disappears at turn 20.\n- Need to go down four steps from (6,5): D,D,D,D.\n- Possible, but further away.\n\n**Food at (2,2)**:\n- Far away, life_span=8 (disappears at turn 23).\n- Not immediately relevant.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if moving towards food could cause tail collision when eating.\n\nFor food at (6,3):\n- After move D at 15: positions [(6,4), (6,5)].\n- Next move D at 16: head to (6,3), tail moves to (6,4).\n- Eat food at (6,3): snake grows to [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5)].\n- Now, tail is at (6,5). Is head adjacent to tail after eating?\n  - Head at (6,3), tail at (6,5): not adjacent (need same x or y with distance 1).\n  - So no immediate collision danger.\n\nSimilarly for other foods, but (6,3) is the closest.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and D:\n- U: moves away from closest food (6,3).\n- D: moves towards closest food (6,3), with enough life_span to reach it.\n\nMoving D is better to aim for the food at (6,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers with D\n\nMove D to (6,4):\n- Is (6,4) safe?\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not on body (body is at (5,5)).\n  - No food there, so no immediate eating.\n- Safe move.\n\n### Alternative Consideration\n\nIs there any reason not to go D?\n- Only if there's a better food to aim for, but (6,3) is the closest positive food.\n- Other foods are either too far or not better.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to position (6,4), setting up to reach the positive food at (6,3) on the next move.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Head moving to (6,3). Adjacent means one cell apart in any direction. (6,3) and (6,5) are two cells apart (y difference of 2), so not adjacent. No danger here.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move with immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 4) [x decreases by 1]\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Body**: (6,5) is not at (5,4).\n  - **Walls**: (5,4) is not a border wall (x=0,7; y=0,7). Internal obstacle is at (5,2), so (5,4) is safe.\n- **Food**: No food at (5,4).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- **New Head Position**: (7, 4) [x increases by 1]\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Body**: (6,5) is not at (7,4).\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,4) is a wall. **Collision**.\n- **Conclusion**: Not safe.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, immediate reward.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **Right (R)**: Unsafe.\n\nBetween D and L, D is preferable because it yields a reward without any risk in this scenario.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that eating the food at (6,3) doesn't cause a collision in the next move due to tail growth.\n\nAfter moving D:\n- New snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] (head at (6,3), new segment at (6,3), body at (6,4), tail at (6,5)).\n- Next move options from (6,3):\n  - Cannot reverse to U (from D), so possible moves are L, R, D.\n  - D would go to (6,2): Check adjacency to tail (6,5).

Move Right (R) to (7, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a border wall → **Collision!** Cannot move here.\n  \nSo, moving Right is invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards any food is beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (6,1)**:\n   - Current head at (6,3). To reach (6,1), need to move Down twice.\n   - Next move Down to (6,2), then Down to (6,1).\n   - At (6,1), the food has a life_span of 3. After this move (Turn 17 to 18), life_span becomes 2, then next turn to 1, then disappears.\n   - So, can reach it in two moves if we start moving Down now.\n   - **Tail Check**: \n     - Current tail is at (6,5). After two moves:\n       - Move 1: Head to (6,2), body to [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4)], tail at (6,4).\n       - Move 2: Head to (6,1), body to [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3)], tail at (6,3).\n     - At (6,1), the tail is at (6,3), which is not adjacent to (6,1) (adjacent would be (5,1), (7,1), (6,0), (6,2)). So no tail reward danger.\n   - **Benefit**: Eating positive food increases length and score by +1.\n\n2. **Food at (2,2) and (3,2)**:\n   - Both are quite far from the current head position (6,3).\n   - Moving towards them would require multiple moves, and other food might be more immediately accessible.\n   - Given that (6,1) is closer and can be reached safely, prioritizing (6,1) seems better.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving Down to (6,2):\n  - Next move would be Down to (6,1) to eat the food.\n  - After eating, the snake grows, so new tail is where the old tail was at the time of eating.\n  - Need to ensure that after growth, the head doesn't collide with the new tail in subsequent moves.\n  - In this case, seems safe.\n\n- Moving Left to (5,3):\n  - Safe but doesn't lead directly to food.\n  - Might be a conservative move if we're unsure, but since (6,1) is safe and beneficial, probably better to go for it.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving Down leads us towards the positive food at (6,1) safely without any immediate risks, and the other options either don't lead to food or are invalid (Right), the best immediate action is to move Down.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to double-check the tail reward danger when eating at (6,1):\n- At the time of eating (head at (6,1)), tail is at (6,3).\n- Adjacent cells to head at (6,1) are:\n  - (5,1), (7,1), (6,0), (6,2).\n- Tail at (6,3) is not adjacent, so no danger.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — can't move here.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (6, 2), then (6, 3), (6, 4). So the snake is vertical, heading downward (direction D).\n   - Current direction: Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6, 1): value=2, life_span=1 (positive food, disappears next turn if not eaten).\n   - (2, 2): value=5, life_span=1 (positive food, disappears next turn if not eaten).\n   - (3, 2): value=8, life_span=1 (positive food, disappears next turn if not eaten).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6, 2) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (6, 1)\n- **Left (L)**: (5, 2)\n- **Right (R)**: (7, 2)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of current direction D (no instant reverse).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (6, 1)**:\n   - Check for collision:\n     - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so (6,1) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,2) is not (6,1), so okay.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (6,3) and (6,4), not (6,1), so no collision.\n   - Food at (6,1): \n     - Value: +2 (positive).\n     - Eating it: \n       - Current tail is at (6,4). After eating, new tail will be where? Normally, the tail moves forward, but since we're growing by 1, the tail stays where it is, and the new segment is added to the head. Wait, no: the snake grows by adding a new head position, and the tail doesn't move until the next move. So after eating, the snake would be [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)].\n       - Is the head adjacent to the tail? Tail is at (6,4), head is moving to (6,1). Adjacent means same x or y with distance 1. (6,1) and (6,4) have distance 3 in y, so not adjacent. So no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n     - So eating is safe and beneficial.\n   - Other food: Not relevant for this move.\n   - Life span: This food disappears next turn, so now is the only chance to eat it.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (5, 2)**:\n   - Check for collision:\n     - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, (5,2) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,2) is an obstacle! So cannot move here.\n   - So Left is invalid.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (7, 2)**:\n   - Check for collision:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, so cannot move here.\n   - So Right is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion on Possible Moves\n\nOnly valid move is Down to (6,1), which has positive food that's safe to eat and will disappear next turn. Other moves are invalid due to walls or obstacles.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to go Down?\n- The other foods are at (2,2) and (3,2), both with higher values (5 and 8), but they're far away. To reach them, we'd have to avoid eating the current food, which disappears next turn, and then navigate towards them, but that seems risky and less immediate.\n- The food at (6,1) is directly below, safe to eat, and will be gone next turn, so it's a clear immediate gain.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- After eating (6,1), the snake grows to length 4. The new positions would be [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)].\n- Next moves would need to avoid colliding with the body, but that's future planning; for now, the immediate move is safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (6,1), gaining +2 points safely.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), with the constraint that we cannot reverse direction immediately (i.e., cannot go Up since current direction is Down).\n\nSo, valid immediate moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: Move to (6, 0)\n   - (6, 0) is a wall (y=0). **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (5, 1)\n   - Check for walls: (5,2) is a wall, but (5,1) is not listed as a wall.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body segments: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (5,1) is not in these.\n   - Valid move.\n   - Check for food: No food at (5,1).\n   - Outcome: Just move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (7, 1)\n   - (7,1): x=7 is a wall. **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n\nSo, the only valid move is Left (L).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nEven though moving left doesn't land on food, let's see if there's any food that could be targeted in future moves to plan ahead.\n\nFoods:\n1. (2,2): value=4, life=1 (will disappear next turn)\n2. (3,2): value=7, life=1 (will disappear next turn)\n3. (4,1): value=10, life=1 (will disappear next turn)\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current). So, we can't reach any food this turn because:\n\n- Current head at (6,1). Possible moves:\n  - L to (5,1): no food.\n  - Can't reach (4,1) in one move.\n  - Can't reach (2,2) or (3,2) in one move.\n\nThus, no food can be eaten this turn regardless of move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous to eat next turn.\n\nTail is at (6,4). Adjacent cells to head (6,1):\n- (5,1), (7,1), (6,0), (6,2)\n(6,4) is not adjacent to head, so no danger from tail food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly valid move is Left (L), which doesn't lead to any immediate food consumption or danger.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (5, 2). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (5,1), followed by body segments at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n   - **Current Direction**: Left (L).

However, it cannot reverse its direction instantly. The current direction is Left (L), so the opposite direction is Right (R), which is not allowed next.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, L (since R is opposite and not allowed).\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: From (5,1) to (4,1)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is at the left, but (4,1) is not a wall.\n     - Internal Obstacle: (5,2) is the only one, not (4,1).\n     - Body: Snake body is at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (4,1) is not in these.\n   - Food at (4,1): Yes, there's food with value=9.\n     - Eating this food would increase length by 1 (new tail would be where the current tail is after moving).\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (6,3). Is the head adjacent to the tail before moving? Head is at (5,1), tail at (6,3). Adjacent means one cell away in any direction. Distance is |5-6| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1). So no danger here.\n   - So, moving Left to (4,1) would eat the food (value=9), increasing length to 5.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: From (5,1) to (5,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is top, (5,2) is fine.\n     - Internal Obstacle: (5,2) is an obstacle! Cannot move here.\n   - So, Up is invalid.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: From (5,1) to (5,0)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a border wall. (5,0) is a wall. Cannot move here.\n   - So, Down is invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nFrom above, the only valid move is Left (L) to (4,1), which eats the high-value food (value=9).\n\nOther food:\n- (2,2) and (3,2) are further away and have lower values (3 and 6 respectively). Also, their life_span is 1, meaning they'll disappear next turn if not eaten now, but we can't reach them in one move anyway.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in moving Left to (4,1)?\n- After eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so new positions would be:\n  - Head: (4,1)\n  - Body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) (new tail is where the old tail was, since we're adding a segment at the head).\n- Next possible moves from (4,1):\n  - Current direction would be Left (since we moved Left).\n  - Possible next moves: U, D, L (no R).\n  - From (4,1), moving Left to (3,1) is possible (no walls or body there).\n  - Moving Up to (4,2): Check if (4,2) is free. Currently, no body or walls there (only internal obstacle is at (5,2)).\n  - Moving Down to (4,0): y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n  - So, next turn would have options, no immediate trap.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to eat the high-value food at (4,1), as it's the only valid move that also maximizes the score without immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

At (2,2) - life_span=2, value=+1\n2. At (3,2) - life_span=5, value=+1\n\n**Walls:**\n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n- Internal: (5,2)\n\n### Possible Movements\n\nThe snake's current direction is Left (L), meaning it was moving towards decreasing x-coordinate. The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but with the following constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse:** Since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot move Right in the next turn.\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall Collisions:** Cannot move into walls or borders.\n   - Current head position: (4,1)\n   - Possible moves from (4,1):\n     - U: (4,2) - Check for walls\n     - D: (4,0) - y=0 is a border wall → invalid\n     - L: (3,1) - Check for walls\n     - R: (5,1) - But R is reverse of L → invalid (no instant reverse)\n\nSo, valid immediate moves: U, L\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see where the food is relative to the head:\n\n1. Food at (2,2):\n   - Distance from head (4,1): Δx=2, Δy=1\n   - To reach (2,2), need to move Left twice and Up once, or vice versa.\n\n2. Food at (3,2):\n   - Distance from head (4,1): Δx=1, Δy=1\n   - To reach (3,2), need to move Left and Up.\n\nGiven that the food at (3,2) is closer, let's see if we can reach it safely.\n\n### Evaluating Move Up (U) to (4,2)\n\n- New head position: (4,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n    - (4,2) is not in body → safe\n  - Walls:\n    - (5,2) is a wall, but we're moving to (4,2) → safe\n    - Borders: (4,2) is within bounds → safe\n- Food at (4,2)? No food listed there → no eating\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, so the body becomes:\n  - New body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n  - Tail was (6,3), now moves to (6,2) as the last segment moves forward\n\nThis move seems safe but doesn't eat any food immediately.\n\n### Evaluating Move Left (L) to (3,1)\n\n- New head position: (3,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n    - (3,1) is not in body → safe\n  - Walls:\n    - No walls at (3,1) → safe\n    - Borders: (3,1) is within bounds → safe\n- Food at (3,1)? No food listed there → no eating\n- After moving, body becomes:\n  - [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n  - Tail was (6,3), now moves to (6,2)\n\nThis move is also safe but doesn't eat food immediately.\n\n### Considering Future Moves for Food\n\nNeither U nor L immediately eats food, but let's see which one sets us up better to reach food next.\n\n1. If we move U to (4,2):\n   - Next possible moves from (4,2):\n     - Current direction would be U, so can't move D (reverse)\n     - Possible: U (to (4,3)), L (to (3,2)), R (to (5,2))\n       - (5,2) is a wall → can't move R\n       - So, U or L\n   - Food at (3,2) is reachable by moving L from (4,2)\n     - Moving L to (3,2):\n       - (3,2) has food with value +1\n       - Check if eating is safe:\n         - After eating, length increases by 1\n         - New head: (3,2), body: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n         - Tail is at (6,2)\n         - Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (3,2), tail at (6,2) → no\n         - So, safe to eat\n\n2. If we move L to (3,1):\n   - Next possible moves from (3,1):\n     - Current direction is L, so can't move R\n     - Possible: U (to (3,2)), D (to (3,0)), L (to (2,1))\n       - D to (3,0): y=0 is border → invalid\n       - So, U or L\n   - Food at (3,2) is reachable by moving U from (3,1)\n     - Moving U to (3,2):\n       - (3,2) has food with value +1\n       - After eating, length increases by 1\n       - New head: (3,2), body: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n       - Tail is at (6,2)\n       - Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (3,2), tail at (6,2) → no\n       - Safe to eat\n\nBoth initial moves can lead to eating the food at (3,2) in the next step. However, moving Up first seems slightly better because:\n\n- After U to (4,2), then L to (3,2):\n  - Path: (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2)\n- After L to (3,1), then U to (3,2):\n  - Path: (4,1) → (3,1) → (3,2)\n\nBoth paths reach the food in two moves, but moving Up first might give more options afterward since we're moving towards the center of the grid, whereas moving Left first takes us closer to the left border (x=0).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Eating\n\nIs there any way to eat food immediately in the next move?\n\nCurrent head at (4,1). Food at:\n\n- (2,2): Need to move L then U, or U then L — can't reach in one move\n- (3,2): Need to move L and U — can't reach in one move\n\nSo, no immediate eating possible.\n\n### Checking for Danger\n\nAre there any dangers in moving U or L?\n\n- Moving U to (4,2):\n  - Next to (5,2) which is a wall, but not moving there\n  - Not adjacent to tail's current position (6,3)\n- Moving L to (3,1):\n  - Not adjacent to any walls or tail\n\nBoth seem safe.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nFood at:\n\n- (2,2): life_span=2\n  - At turn 21, it will decrease to 1 at turn 22, then disappear at turn 23\n- (3,2): life_span=5\n  - Will last until turn 26\n\nNo immediate urgency based on life spans.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that both U and L are safe and can lead to eating food in the next move, and neither is strictly better than the other, I can choose either. However, moving Up first seems slightly more central, giving more options afterward.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move Up (U)\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Not part of the snake's body except the tail, but tail will move.\n   - Moving Up (U): from (3,2) to (3,3).\n     - Check (3,3): Not a wall or obstacle. Not part of the snake's body.\n   - Moving Down (D): from (3,2) to (3,1).\n     - Check (3,1): Part of the snake's body at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but not at (3,1). Wait, no: looking at snake positions, (3,1) is not listed, so it's safe.\n\nWait, let's list the snake's body positions to ensure no collision:\n\nSnake positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)].\n\nSo:\n- (2,2): Not in snake positions → safe.\n- (3,3): Not in snake positions → safe.\n- (3,1): Not in snake positions → safe.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2,2)**:\n   - New head: (2,2).\n   - Tail was at (6,2), will move to (6,1) (since the snake moves forward).\n   - Check if (2,2) is food: No, food is at (4,4).\n   - No immediate reward, just moving.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (3,3)**:\n   - New head: (3,3).\n   - Tail moves to (6,1).\n   - Check if (3,3) is food: No.\n   - No immediate reward.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (3,1)**:\n   - New head: (3,1).\n   - Tail moves to (6,1).\n   - Check if (3,1) is food: No.\n   - No immediate reward.\n\n### Food Consideration\n\nThe only food is at (4,4), which is two moves away from the current head position (3,2):\n- One move Up to (3,3), then Right to (4,3), then Up to (4,4).\nBut we're only deciding the immediate next move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food:\n- Tail is at (6,2).\n- Head is at (3,2). Distance is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3, not adjacent (adjacent means distance = 1).\nSo no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Optimal Move\n\nSince no move immediately leads to food, and all possible moves are safe, we can choose any of U, D, L. But we might want to move towards the food at (4,4):\n\nFrom (3,2):\n- Food is at (4,4): Δx = +1, Δy = +2.\nTo get closer, moving Up (U) increases y towards food.\n\nAlternatively, moving Left (L) takes us away from the food's x-coordinate, so not ideal.\n\nMoving Down (D) decreases y, away from food.\n\nSo, **Up (U)** seems the best choice to eventually reach the food.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Up (U)\n\nMove to (3,3):\n- Not a wall.\n- Not an obstacle.\n- Not part of the snake's body.\n- Next turn, we can consider moving Right to (4,3), then Up to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and most strategic immediate move is **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 24\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (3, 3)\n   - Body: [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)]\n   - So the snake is 6 segments long.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which is (x, y+1))\n5. **Food**:\n   - Only one piece: (4, 4) with value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (3, 3)\n  - Next segment at (3, 2)\n  - Then (4, 2)\n  - Then (4, 1)\n  - Then (5, 1)\n  - Then (6, 1)\n  \n- Food at (4, 4)\n\nThe walls are at the borders and there's an internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). But we have to consider:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Current direction is U, so we cannot move D next.\n   - So possible moves: U, L, R\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - Moving U from (3,3): (3,4) — check if this is a wall or obstacle.\n     - y=4 is not y=7, and x=3 is not x=0 or x=7. No internal obstacle at (3,4). So U is safe.\n   - Moving L from (3,3): (2,3) — check:\n     - x=2 is not x=0 or x=7, y=3 is not y=0 or y=7. No obstacle at (2,3). So L is safe.\n   - Moving R from (3,3): (4,3) — check:\n     - x=4 is not x=0 or x=7, y=3 is not y=0 or y=7. No obstacle at (4,3). So R is safe.\n\n3. **Body Collisions**:\n   - Moving U to (3,4): Check if (3,4) is in snake body.\n     - Snake body positions: (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). (3,4) is not there. Safe.\n   - Moving L to (2,3): Check if (2,3) is in snake body.\n     - Not in body. Safe.\n   - Moving R to (4,3): Check if (4,3) is in snake body.\n     - Not in body. Safe.\n\nSo all three possible moves (U, L, R) are safe in terms of walls and body collisions.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThere's one food at (4,4) with value=9 (positive) and life_span=1.\n\n- Life_span=1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n- Value=9 is positive, so eating it is good (+1 score, length +1).\n\nCan we eat it this turn?\n\nTo eat food at (4,4):\n- The head must move to (4,4).\n- Current head is at (3,3).\n- To go from (3,3) to (4,4), we need to move R then U, or U then R, but we can only move one step per turn.\n- So we cannot reach (4,4) in one move from (3,3). The possible moves from (3,3) are:\n  - U: (3,4)\n  - L: (2,3)\n  - R: (4,3)\n  \nNone of these reach (4,4). So we cannot eat the food this turn.\n\nSince the food's life_span is 1, it will disappear after this turn. So we don't need to consider it for future moves beyond this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nLet's check:\n- Tail is the last segment: (6,1).\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail? Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1, or same y and x differs by 1.\n  - Head is (3,3), tail is (6,1).\n  - Distance in x: 3, distance in y: 2. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance of 1 in one coordinate and 0 in the other).\n- Also, tail is at (6,1), which doesn't have food (food is at (4,4)).\n  \nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince we can't eat the food this turn and all three possible moves are safe, we should choose a move that:\n1. Doesn't lead us into a trap in future moves.\n2. Maximizes future opportunities to find food.\n\nLet's see where each move takes us:\n\n1. **Move U to (3,4)**:\n   - New head: (3,4)\n   - Next possible moves from (3,4): Can't reverse (was U, so can't go D), so can go U, L, R.\n   - U: (3,5) — check walls: y=5 is not y=7, safe.\n   - L: (2,4) — safe.\n   - R: (4,4) — safe unless food is there (but food will disappear after this turn).\n   - Seems safe, but no immediate benefit.\n\n2. **Move L to (2,3)**:\n   - New head: (2,3)\n   - Next possible moves: Can't go R (reverse), so can go U, D, L.\n   - U: (2,4) — safe.\n   - D: (2,2) — safe.\n   - L: (1,3) — safe.\n   - Also safe, but no immediate benefit.\n\n3. **Move R to (4,3)**:\n   - New head: (4,3)\n   - Next possible moves: Can't go L (reverse), so can go U, D, R.\n   - U: (4,4) — food is at (4,4) but will be gone next turn.\n   - D: (4,2) — check:\n     - (4,2) is in snake body? Snake body after move: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] — wait, no, the tail moves forward, so the body is [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)] — so (4,2) is in body. So D is unsafe (body collision).\n   - R: (5,3) — check walls: (5,2) is an obstacle, but (5,3) is not directly a wall. But is (5,3) safe? No body there.\n     - Safe unless it's a wall, but walls are at x=0,7, y=0,7 and (5,2). So (5,3) is safe.\n   - So from (4,3), possible next moves are U (food gone), R (safe), D (unsafe).\n\nMoving R to (4,3) seems slightly better because next turn we can go R to (5,3), which is safe, and maybe explore more area.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll three moves are safe this turn, but:\n- Moving U or L doesn't give us any immediate advantage.\n- Moving R to (4,3) allows us to potentially explore more next turn by moving R again to (5,3), avoiding getting boxed in.\n\nGiven that the food is unreachable this turn and will disappear, and no immediate dangers, moving R seems like a reasonable choice to explore more space.\n\nHowever, another consideration is that moving U to (3,4) might open up more options in the future, as it's moving away from the current body. Moving R brings us closer to the right wall and the obstacle at (5,2), which might limit future moves.\n\nGiven that, moving U might be slightly better to keep more options open.\n\nBut since both are safe and no immediate benefit, either is fine. I'll choose U to move away from the body's current position.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Up (U) to (3, 5)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,5) is not a wall (y=7 is wall, y=5 is fine).\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). (3,5) is not in body.\n- Food at (3,5): No food there.\n- Next to tail: Tail is at (5,1). Distance from (3,5) to (5,1) is more than adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food immediately.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (2, 4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is wall, x=2 is not.\n  - Body: (2,4) is not in body segments.\n- Food at (2,4): No food there.\n- Next to tail: Not adjacent to tail.\n\nSafe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (4, 4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is wall, x=4 is not.\n  - Body: (4,4) is not in body segments (body is at (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)).\n- Food at (4,4): Yes, there's positive food with value 8.\n  \nNow, check if eating this food is safe:\n- After eating, snake grows by 1, so new tail will be where the current tail is (5,1), but since the head moves to (4,4), the body will extend, and the new tail will be the second last segment before the current tail, which is (4,1).\n- Is the head adjacent to the new tail after move? New head at (4,4), new tail at (4,1). They are not adjacent (distance is 3 in y direction), so no collision.\n  \nThis move allows eating positive food safely.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Up (U): Safe, no food.\n- Left (L): Safe, no food.\n- Right (R): Safe, eats positive food (value 8).\n\nThe food at (3,6) is also positive (value 10), but it's two steps up from current head (from (3,4) to (3,5) to (3,6)). However, its life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So at turn 25, life_span=1, at turn 26 it's gone. So we can't reach it in this turn.\n\nThe food at (4,4) has life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn as well. But we can reach it in this turn by moving Right.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to (4,4) to eat the positive food worth 8 points before it disappears.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that eating the food at (4,4) doesn't cause a tail reward danger:\n- Current tail is at (5,1).\n- After moving right to (4,4) and eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new body will be:\n  - Head: (4,4)\n  - Body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) → but since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so new tail is still (5,1), but the segment before tail is (4,1).\n- Head at (4,4) is not adjacent to tail at (5,1) (distance is sqrt((4-5)^2 + (4-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10) > 1), so no collision.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite direction).\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Body Collisions**:\n   - **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n     - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, but (5,4) is not a wall (internal obstacle is at (5,2)).\n     - Check body: Snake body is at [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]. (5,4) is not in the body.\n     - Valid move.\n   - **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n     - Check walls: y=7 is a wall, (4,5) is not a wall.\n     - Check body: (4,5) is not in the body.\n     - Valid move.\n   - **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n     - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, (4,3) is not a wall.\n     - Check body: (4,3) is not in the body (body is at y=4,3,2,2,1,1).\n     - Valid move.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Based on Food\n\nThere's only one food at (3,6):\n\n- **Distance to Food**:\n  - Current head: (4,4)\n  - Food: (3,6)\n  - Manhattan distance: |4-3| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nLet's see how each move affects the distance to food:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n   - Distance to (3,6): |5-3| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4 (increases distance).\n2. **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n   - Distance to (3,6): |4-3| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2 (decreases distance).\n3. **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n   - Distance to (3,6): |4-3| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4 (increases distance).\n\n**Up (U)** decreases the distance to food the most.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Access\n\nIs the food at (3,6) accessible in the next move?\n\n- Current head at (4,4), food at (3,6).\n- To reach (3,6) from (4,4), need to move left then up or up then left.\n- Next move can only be U, D, or R (cannot move L due to no instant reverse).\n- Moving U to (4,5):\n  - Next move could be L to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n- But is the food under the snake's body? Let's check:\n  - Snake body: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)].\n  - Food is at (3,6), which is not under the snake's body.\n  - So, the food is not under the body, and we can move towards it normally.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could cause a collision if eaten?\n\n- Tail is at (5,1).\n- Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - (4,1) - part of the body (not food).\n  - (5,0) - y=0 is a wall.\n  - (6,1) - x=7 is a wall, (6,1) is not a wall, but no food there.\n  - (5,2) - wall (internal obstacle).\n- No positive food adjacent to tail, so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Life Span of Food**: The food at (3,6) has life_span=9, which is high, so not urgent to eat immediately.\n- **Alternative Moves**:\n  - Moving Right (R) to (5,4) is safe but moves away from food.\n  - Moving Down (D) to (4,3) is safe but moves away from food.\n  - Moving Up (U) to (4,5) is safe and moves towards food.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After U\n\nIf we move U to (4,5), next possible moves:\n\n- From (4,5), direction U:\n  - Can move U, D, L (cannot move R if current move is U, assuming direction updates).\n  - To reach food at (3,6), next move could be L to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n\nThis seems like a viable path to the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions After U\n\nAfter moving U to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n- Body becomes: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n  - Tail (5,1) moves away, so no collision with new head.\n- No walls at (4,5).\n- Safe move.\n\n### Alternative: Moving Right (R)\n\nMoving R to (5,4):\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n  - Tail moves to (4,1), no collision.\n- No walls at (5,4).\n- But moves away from food.\n\n### Alternative: Moving Down (D)\n\nMoving D to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n- Body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n  - (3,3) is part of the body, but tail moves to (4,1), so no collision.\n- No walls at (4,3).\n- Moves away from food.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move towards the food while ensuring safety. Moving Up (U) decreases the distance to the food and is safe.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 27\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 2)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (4, 5)\n   - Body: [(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)]\n   - So the snake is 7 segments long.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (\"U\").\n5. **Food**:\n   - Only one piece: at (3, 6) with value = 8, life_span = 1.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake head at (4,5), moving Up (U) means it was at (4,4) before.\n- Next segments: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1).\n- Food is at (3,6).\n\nThe grid is 8x8, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction immediately. Current direction is U, so it cannot go D next.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: From (4,5) to (4,6)\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is a wall, (4,6) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: Is (4,6) in the snake's body?\n     - Current body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — no (4,6).\n   - Safe move.\n   - Distance to food at (3,6):\n     - Current head: (4,5), food: (3,6).\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-3| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n     - After U to (4,6), distance to (3,6): |4-3| + |6-6| = 1 + 0 = 1 (closer).\n   - Next move could be L to reach food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: From (4,5) to (3,5)\n   - Check walls: x=0 is wall, (3,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Is (3,5) in body?\n     - Body segments: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — no (3,5).\n   - Safe move.\n   - Distance to food at (3,6):\n     - After L to (3,5), distance to (3,6): |3-3| + |5-6| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n     - Next move could be U to reach food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: From (4,5) to (5,5)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is wall, (5,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Is (5,5) in body? No.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Distance to food at (3,6):\n     - After R to (5,5), distance to (3,6): |5-3| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3 (farther).\n   - Not helpful for reaching food.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nFood at (3,6):\n- Value: 8 (positive food, so +1 score, length +1).\n- Life_span: 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nWe want to eat this food if possible because it's high value and will disappear soon.\n\n### Path to Food\n\nFrom head (4,5), food at (3,6):\n\nOption 1:\n- Move U to (4,6), then next turn move L to (3,6) to eat food.\n  - But food's life_span is 1, so after this turn (t=27), it will disappear. So can't eat it next turn.\n\nOption 2:\n- Move L to (3,5), then next turn move U to (3,6) to eat food.\n  - Same issue: food disappears after this turn, can't eat next turn.\n\nSo we cannot eat the food this turn because it's not adjacent to the head. The only way to eat food is to move onto it in the current turn, but it's not adjacent in one move.\n\nWait, let me check adjacency:\n\nCurrent head: (4,5)\nFood: (3,6)\n\nAdjacent cells to head:\n- U: (4,6)\n- D: (4,4) (but can't go D)\n- L: (3,5)\n- R: (5,5)\n\nFood is at (3,6), which is diagonally adjacent (left and up), but not directly adjacent in one move. So cannot eat it this turn.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nSince we can't eat the food this turn (it will disappear after this turn), we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it for future food.\n\nFrom possible moves:\n- U to (4,6): safe, moves away from body.\n- L to (3,5): safe, moves towards where food was (but food will be gone).\n- R to (5,5): safe, but not helpful.\n\nBetween U and L, both are safe. U moves towards the top, L moves left.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving L to (3,5) is next to (3,4), which is the second body segment. Not immediately dangerous, but let's see future moves.\n\nMoving U to (4,6):\n- Next turn, head at (4,6), direction U.\n- Possible moves: U (to (4,7) - but y=7 is wall, so can't.\n- L to (3,6) - but no food there now.\n- R to (5,6) - safe.\nSo next move would likely be R.\n\nMoving L to (3,5):\n- Next turn, head at (3,5), direction L.\n- Possible moves: L (to (2,5)), U (to (3,6)), D (to (3,4) - but that's body).\nSo next move could be L or U.\n\nBoth seem safe. Maybe U is slightly better as it moves towards the center.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\nTail is at (4,1). Head is at (4,5), not adjacent (distance is 4 in y). So no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince we can't eat the food this turn, and both U and L are safe, I'll choose U to move towards the center and away from the body.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 28 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y go from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move to these coordinates.\n   - Internal obstacle at (5, 2). The snake can't move here either.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)].\n     - Head is at (4,6).\n     - Tail is at (4,2).\n   - Current head direction: Up (U). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous turn.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (3,6): value = +1, life_span = 7.\n   - Food at (4,5): value = +1, life_span = 10.\n     - Note: (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake's body (second segment).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,6), possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (4,7) → but y=7 is a wall. **Invalid** (would collide with wall).\n- Down (D): (4,5) → currently occupied by the snake's body (second segment at (4,5)).\n  - Normally, moving into your own body is deadly, but there's an exception: if it's the tail, and the tail will move away.\n  - Here, the tail is at (4,2), so (4,5) is not the tail. **Invalid** (body collision).\n- Left (L): (3,6) → let's check this.\n- Right (R): (5,6) → let's check this.\n\nSo, possible valid moves are Left (L) and Right (R).\n\n### Checking Left (L) to (3,6)\n\n- (3,6) has food with value +1, life_span 7.\n- Moving left would eat this food.\n- After eating:\n  - Snake grows by 1: new head at (3,6), body extends to include old head (4,6), then (4,5), etc.\n  - New length: 8 segments.\n- Check for Tail Reward Danger:\n  - Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n    - Current tail is at (4,2).\n    - Head is at (4,6), tail at (4,2): not adjacent (distance is 4 in y-direction).\n    - So, no danger here.\n- Is (3,6) a valid move otherwise?\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Not part of the snake's body except possibly the tail, but tail is at (4,2).\n  - So, valid.\n\n### Checking Right (R) to (5,6)\n\n- (5,6): no food mentioned here, so assume no food.\n- Is (5,6) valid?\n  - Not a wall (x=5 is not a border, y=6 is not a border).\n  - Not an internal obstacle (only obstacle is at (5,2)).\n  - Not part of the snake's body.\n  - So, valid move, but no reward.\n\n### Comparing Left and Right\n\n- Left (L):\n  - Eats positive food (+1 score, +1 length).\n  - No immediate dangers.\n- Right (R):\n  - No food, so no score gain.\n  - Safe, but not beneficial.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- The food at (4,5) is under the snake's body. Can we eat it?\n  - To eat it, the body must move away, and then the head moves onto it.\n  - Currently, the body at (4,5) is the second segment. To move it away, the snake would have to move in a way that this segment moves.\n  - But the head is at (4,6), moving left or right doesn't immediately help in eating (4,5).\n  - Maybe in future turns, but not now.\n- Life span of foods:\n  - (3,6): life_span = 7. It's been there for some turns (assuming it appeared at turn \\( t_0 - life\\_span + 1 \\)), but since \\( t_0 = 28 \\), it appeared at turn 22. Still has 7 turns left (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n  - (4,5): life_span = 10, appeared at turn 19, has 10 turns left.\n  - So both foods will be around for a while; no urgency based on life span.\n\n### Immediate Best Action\n\nBetween Left and Right, Left is clearly better because it gives us a point and grows the snake safely.\n\n### Verifying No Instant Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is Up (U). Opposite is Down (D), which we're not considering (it's invalid anyway). Left and Right are not opposites of Up, so no issue with instant reverse.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to eat the positive food at (3,6).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n     - Head: (3, 6)\n     - Body segments: (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2)\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving Left (\"L\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one piece of food is present at (4, 5) with:\n     - Value: 9 (this seems unusually high; typically, food values are +1 or -1, but assuming it's positive based on the description)\n     - Life Span: 1 (it will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body and the food position:\n\n- Head at (3, 6)\n- Next segment at (4, 6)\n- Then (4, 5) — this is where the food is located!\n- Then (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2)\n\nThe food is at (4, 5), which is currently occupied by the snake's third segment. According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away from that cell, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Left (\"L\"). From the head at (3, 6), possible moves are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (2, 6) — but x=2 is not a wall, and (2,6) is not part of the snake's body except possibly the tail, which moves away.\n  - Check body: The body segments are (4,6), (4,5), etc. (2,6) is not in the body, so safe.\n  - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=2 is not.\n- **Up (U)**: (3, 7) — but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (3, 5) — check:\n  - Walls: y=5 is not a wall.\n  - Body: Is (3,5) in the body? Current body: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2). (3,5) is not in the body, so safe.\n- **Right (R)**: (4, 6) — but this is the immediate next body segment, so moving right would collide with the body, leading to death.\n\nAlso, we cannot make an instant reverse. Current direction is Left (\"L\"), so the opposite is Right (\"R\"), which is invalid for the next move.\n\nSo, valid moves are Left (\"L\") and Down (\"D\").\n\n### Evaluating Moves for Food Consumption\n\nThe food is at (4, 5), currently under the snake's body at (4, 5). To eat it:\n\n1. The body must move away from (4,5).\n   - If the snake moves Left (\"L\"):\n     - New head: (2, 6)\n     - Body segments shift: new body is (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n     - (4,5) is still occupied by the third segment, so the food is still under the body.\n   - If the snake moves Down (\"D\"):\n     - New head: (3, 5)\n     - Body shifts: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n     - (4,5) is still occupied by the third segment.\n\nNeither move immediately frees up (4,5). However, the food's life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So, we cannot eat it this turn because the body is still on it.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (4,2). Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\n- Head is at (3,6), tail at (4,2). They are not adjacent (distance is |3-4| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5), so no danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nSince we cannot eat the food this turn (it's under the body and will disappear next turn), we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it for future food.\n\nValid moves: Left (\"L\") or Down (\"D\").\n\n- **Left (\"L\") to (2,6)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (2,6): cannot go Right (reverse), can go Up (2,7) which is a wall, Down (2,5), Left (1,6).\n  - Down (\"D\") to (2,5) seems safe, but we're moving away from the center where food might spawn.\n- **Down (\"D\") to (3,5)**:\n  - From (3,5), possible moves: cannot go Up (reverse), can go Left (2,5), Right (4,5), Down (3,4).\n  - (4,5) is where the food is, but it will be gone next turn.\n  - Moving Down to (3,4) would collide with the body segment at (3,4) after the move, but actually, the body would shift:\n    - New head: (3,5)\n    - Body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n    - Moving Down to (3,4): (3,4) is the 5th segment, but after the move, the tail moves away, so the new body is (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n    - So (3,4) is now the 6th segment, and the head moves to (3,4), which is the same as the new 6th segment — but the tail was at (3,2), which moves to (4,2) is gone, and (3,3) is now the tail.\n    - Wait, no: original body is (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) — wait, the positions list has 8 segments? But the length is usually head + body segments. Maybe the initial list includes the head and 7 body segments, making the snake length 8.\n     - If we move Down to (3,5), the new body is (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — length 7 (head + 6 body segments), so the tail (4,2) is removed.\n     - Then moving Down to (3,4): new head (3,4), body (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — but now (3,4) is both head and last body segment, which is a collision.\n     - So moving Down to (3,5) is safe, but then next move Down would be unsafe.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems safer to avoid getting boxed in.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween Left (\"L\") and Down (\"D\"), moving Left seems safer because:\n\n- Down leads to a position where the next Down move could cause a collision.\n- Left moves towards the edge but still has room to maneuver next turn.\n\nHowever, moving Left to (2,6) is close to the wall at x=0, which might limit future moves. But since we're not in immediate danger and the food is not eatable this turn, it's a reasonable choice.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (3,5) is also safe this turn, and next turn we could go Left to (2,5) or Right to (4,5) (but food will be gone), or Down to (3,4) which is unsafe. So Left next turn from (3,5) is safe.\n\nGiven that, both moves seem similarly safe this turn, but Down might position us better for future moves away from the wall.\n\n**Choosing Down (\"D\") to (3,5)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: (5, 2) is also a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (3, 5), followed by body segments: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).\n   - Current direction: Down (D), meaning the snake was moving downwards in the previous move.\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item at (4, 5) with value = 8 and life_span = 1.\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot immediately reverse to Up (U) (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) - (x, y-1)\n- Current head: (3, 5)\n- New head position: (3, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: The body segments are [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)].\n    - (3,4) is a body segment. Moving to (3,4) would mean the head collides with the body (specifically, the segment at (3,4)), which is deadly.\n  - Walls: (3,4) is not a wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Moving Down leads to a body collision. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\n- New head position: (2, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: Is (2,5) in the body? Let's see the body positions:\n    - (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — none at (2,5).\n  - Walls:\n    - x=0 is a wall. (2,5) is x=2, not a wall.\n    - Internal obstacle at (5,2) — not relevant here.\n- Check for food:\n  - Food is at (4,5). Not at (2,5).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (x+1, y)\n- New head position: (4, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: Is (4,5) in the body? Yes, (4,5) is the 4th segment in the body list.\n    - However, (4,5) is the tail's position after the move because the tail moves forward when the snake moves.\n    - Normally, moving into the tail's current position is safe because the tail moves away, but here's a special case:\n      - **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n      - Current tail is at (3,2). The head is at (3,5), so distance is |3-3| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n      - So, the tail is not adjacent to the head, so this rule doesn't apply.\n    - But (4,5) is a body segment that's not the tail. The tail is at (3,2). So moving to (4,5) would collide with the body segment at (4,5), which is deadly.\n  - Wait, let's clarify the body segments after movement:\n    - Current body: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n    - If head moves to (4,5), new body becomes [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n      - The tail (3,2) is removed, but now (4,5) is both the new head and a body segment (the one that was at (4,5) before moves to (4,4)).\n      - This seems like a collision with the body.\n  - **Conclusion**: Moving Right leads to a body collision. **Invalid move**.\n\nWait, but the food is at (4,5). If we move to (4,5), we eat the food, and the snake grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move. Let me re-examine:\n\nIf head moves to (4,5) where food is:\n- Current length: 8 (from positions list)\n- After eating, length becomes 9.\n- New body: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n  - Now, the head is at (4,5), and the segment that was at (4,5) is now at (4,4), but the head is at (4,5), so no immediate collision.\n  - But the next segment is (3,5), which is not adjacent to (4,5) in terms of collision (since collision is head touching any body segment).\n  - Wait, is (4,5) touching any other body segment? The next segment is (3,5), which is not the same or adjacent unless diagonal adjacency counts, but typically in Snake, it's same cell collision.\n  - Actually, the body segments after head are: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).\n    - (4,5) is in the body segments at position 4 (from head: head is 0, then 1: (3,5), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5)).\n    - So the head is at (4,5), and (4,5) is also a body segment. That's a collision.\n- **Therefore**, moving Right to eat the food at (4,5) causes the head to collide with the body segment at (4,5), which is deadly.\n\nSo, moving Right is invalid due to body collision when eating the food.\n\n#### Re-evaluating Moves\n\nFrom above:\n- Down: Collision with body at (3,4) — invalid.\n- Right: Collision with body at (4,5) when eating food — invalid.\n- Left: Safe, no food eaten.\n\nIs there any other consideration? The food at (4,5) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But we can't eat it safely, so we have to let it disappear.\n\n### Checking for Other Food\n\nOnly one food is present at (4,5). No other food to consider.\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nValid moves:\n- Left (L): Safe, no food.\n- Down (D): Collision — invalid.\n- Right (R): Collision — invalid.\n- Up (U): Opposite of current direction (D) — invalid (no instant reverse).\n\nOnly Left is valid.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe only safe move is Left (L). \n\n\\boxed{L}",

The grid is 6x6 (from (1,1) to (6,6)), with (5,2) being an internal wall.\n\nHere's a rough sketch:\n\n```\ny=6: ... (3,6) (4,6) ...\ny=5: (2,5) (3,5) ... (4,5) ...\ny=4: ... (3,4) (4,4) ...\ny=3: ... (3,3) ...\n...\ny=1: (2,1) ...\n```\n\nFood at:\n- (4,5): on the body segment (4,5)\n- (2,1): free\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), but we cannot reverse direction immediately, so we can't go Right (opposite of Left). So possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: from (2,5) to (1,5)\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, so x=1 is allowed (border is x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is within bounds)\n   - Check body collision: next position is (1,5). Is (1,5) in the body? Current body positions are from (3,5) to (3,3). (1,5) is not in the body.\n   - Safe move.\n   - No food at (1,5).\n\n2. **Up (U)**: from (2,5) to (2,6)\n   - Check walls: y=7 is border, y=6 is allowed.\n   - Check body collision: (2,6) is not in body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n   - No food at (2,6).\n\n3. **Down (D)**: from (2,5) to (2,4)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is border, y=4 is allowed.\n   - Check body collision: (2,4) is not in body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n   - No food at (2,4).\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. (4,5, 7, 1):\n   - Position: (4,5) - currently occupied by the snake's body (specifically, the 5th segment: (4,5))\n   - To eat this, the body must move away, and then the head moves onto it.\n   - Currently, the head is at (2,5), moving left to (1,5) doesn't help in reaching (4,5).\n   - Other moves also don't immediately help in reaching (4,5).\n   - So, this food is not immediately accessible in this move.\n\n2. (2,1, 10, 1):\n   - Position: (2,1)\n   - Currently free (not under snake's body).\n   - To reach it from (2,5), we need to move down multiple times.\n   - Current move options:\n     - Left: (1,5) - away from (2,1)\n     - Up: (2,6) - away\n     - Down: (2,4) - closer to (2,1)\n   - So, moving Down is towards (2,1), but it's still several moves away.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail having positive food:\n- If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (3,3).\n- Head is at (2,5). Adjacent cells to head are:\n  - (1,5), (3,5) - left and right\n  - (2,4), (2,6) - down and up\n- Tail is at (3,3), not adjacent to head (distance is more than 1).\n- So, no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body.\n\n- Left (L): moves towards the left border, no food in that direction.\n- Up (U): moves towards the top, no food there.\n- Down (D): moves towards (2,1) food, but still far.\n\nCurrently, none of the moves lead directly to food. The food at (4,5) is under the body and not immediately accessible. The food at (2,1) is far, and moving down is a step towards it, but not immediately beneficial.\n\nGiven that, the safest move is probably to continue Left, as it's the current direction and doesn't lead into any immediate danger. Moving Down might be slightly better to eventually reach (2,1), but since we're not sure about future moves, sticking to Left is safe.\n\nHowever, moving Down starts the path towards (2,1), which is the only accessible food right now. Moving Left or Up doesn't help in reaching any food soon.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween moving Left (safe, no progress towards food) and Down (safe, starts path towards food), Down seems slightly better for long-term score maximization.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (5, 2). The snake cannot move here.\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n   - Head: (2, 4)\n   - Body segments: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)\n   - So, the tail is at (3,4).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D). This means the last move was from (2,5) to (2,4) (since moving down decreases the y-coordinate).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (4,5): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - (2,1): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,4) moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (3,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,3)\n  \nCannot move Up (U) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (D), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (1,4) is x=1, which is safe.\n  - Body segments: The body is at [(2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)]. (1,4) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Food at (1,4)? No, the foods are at (4,5) and (2,1).\n- So, this is a safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R) to (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, (3,4) is safe.\n  - Body segments: The tail is at (3,4). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Is there positive food at the tail? The tail is at (3,4). Looking at food positions:\n      - (4,5): not at (3,4)\n      - (2,1): not at (3,4)\n    - So, no food at the tail, hence no danger.\n- Food at (3,4)? No.\n- This is also a safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the bottom wall, (2,3) is safe.\n  - Body segments: (2,3) is not in the body list.\n- Food at (2,3)? No.\n- Safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if we can aim for any in the next moves.\n\n1. **Food at (4,5)**:\n   - Value: 6\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position of head: (2,4)\n   - To reach (4,5) from (2,4):\n     - Need to move Right twice and Up once, or Up once and Right twice, etc.\n     - But it's two steps away, and the food will disappear after this turn, so we can't reach it in time.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat this food.\n\n2. **Food at (2,1)**:\n   - Value: 9\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position of head: (2,4)\n   - To reach (2,1) from (2,4):\n     - Need to move Down three times (from (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1)).\n     - But life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Can't reach it in time.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat this food.\n\nSo, neither food can be eaten this turn due to their life spans. We'll have to make a safe move that doesn't lead to immediate death and positions us well for future food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nLooking at the current position and possible moves, none of them lead to immediate collision or death. \n\nHowever, let's think about future moves:\n\n- If we move Left to (1,4), next possible moves would be L/D/R (can't go U opposite to D).\n- If we move Right to (3,4), next moves would be U/D/R (can't go L opposite to R).\n- If we move Down to (2,3), next moves would be L/R/D (can't go U opposite to D).\n\nMoving Right to (3,4) is interesting because the tail is currently at (3,4), but as the tail moves forward, the new tail will be at (3,5), so no immediate collision. \n\nMoving Down to (2,3) seems safe and opens up more options in the lower part of the grid where there might be future food.\n\nMoving Left to (1,4) is also safe but might corner us near the left wall.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince none of the foods are reachable this turn, and all possible moves are safe, we can choose any. However, moving Down seems slightly better because:\n\n- It moves us away from the current body positions.\n- It doesn't corner us near walls immediately.\n- It might position us better for future food that could appear in the lower part of the grid.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that moving Right to (3,4) doesn't trigger Tail Reward Danger:\n\n- Tail is at (3,4), head moves to (3,4).\n- Is there positive food at (3,4)? No.\n- So, no danger.\n\nBut since moving Down is also safe and might be slightly better strategically, I'll choose that.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

This can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n  - (2,1): Below the head, currently not under the snake.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Down (D). Possible moves (cannot reverse to Up immediately):\n\n- Left (L): (x-1, y) → (1, 3)\n- Right (R): (x+1, y) → (3, 3)\n- Down (D): (x, y-1) → (2, 2)\n\n(Up is opposite of current direction, so not allowed.)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, x=1 is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (1,3) is in snake body segments.\n    - Snake body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)\n    - (1,3) is not in the body → safe.\n- Food:\n  - No food at (1,3).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### Move Right (R) to (3, 3)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is far, no wall at x=3.\n  - Body: (3,3) not in body segments → safe.\n- Food:\n  - No food at (3,3).\n  \nSafe but no food.\n\n#### Move Down (D) to (2, 2)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=7 (assuming y decreases downward), y=2 is not a wall.\n  - Body: (2,2) not in body segments → safe.\n- Food:\n  - No food at (2,2).\n  \nSafe but no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's think about how to reach the food.\n\n1. **Food at (4,5)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (4,5).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (4,5).\n     - Then the head must move onto (4,5).\n   - Currently, the tail is at (4,4). Next move, the tail will move to (4,5) if the head moves in a way that shifts the body.\n   - But if the head moves to (3,3), the body will shift, and the segment at (4,5) will move to (4,6), but (4,5) will still be occupied by the next segment.\n   - It seems complex to free (4,5) immediately; may not be possible in one move.\n\n2. **Food at (2,1)**:\n   - To reach (2,1) from (2,3):\n     - Need to move down twice: (2,3)→(2,2)→(2,1).\n     - First move down to (2,2) is safe.\n     - Next move down to (2,1):\n       - Check if (2,1) is safe:\n         - Not a wall.\n         - Not in body unless the snake grows.\n       - Currently, the tail is at (4,4). After first move down to (2,2), the tail moves to (2,4), then next move tail moves to (2,5), etc., so (2,1) should be free unless the snake grows.\n       - But if we eat food at (2,1), the snake grows, and the tail doesn't move, so the new tail would be at (4,4), and the head at (2,1) would not collide with any body part.\n   - However, we need to ensure that after moving to (2,2), the next move to (2,1) is allowed (no instant reverse, but current direction is down, so moving down again is fine).\n\nBut the current task is to decide the immediate action at t=33, not plan multiple moves ahead. So we can consider moving towards (2,1) by moving down to (2,2).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special case is \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- Current tail is at (4,4).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5).\n- Head is at (2,3), not adjacent to tail (distance is more than 1).\n- So no immediate danger from this.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves\n\nGiven that moving towards (2,1) seems beneficial, and the immediate move down to (2,2) is safe and progresses towards the food, this seems like a good choice.\n\nOther moves (Left or Right) are safe but don't progress towards food.\n\n### Verifying Other Possibilities\n\nIs there any immediate way to eat the food at (4,5)?\n\n- Currently, the head is at (2,3), food at (4,5).\n- To reach (4,5), need to move right and down.\n- Immediate move right to (3,3), then next moves could be right and down, but it's not straightforward to free (4,5) quickly.\n- Seems less efficient than going for (2,1).\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate move is Down to (2,2), progressing towards the food at (2,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 34  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (2, 2), then the body segments follow:  \n[(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]  \nSo, the tail is at (4, 5).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis means the snake was moving downward in the previous move. The \"no instant reverse\" rule implies we cannot move Up (U) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (4, 5): value = 1, life_span = 4\n   - This is at the tail's current position.\n2. (2, 1): value = 1, life_span = 7\n3. (2, 3): value = 1, life_span = 10\n   - This is on the snake's body at (2, 3), which is the second segment after the head.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (2, 2), moving Down (D) is the current direction. Possible moves from here are:\n- Down (D): (2, 1)\n- Left (L): (1, 2)\n- Right (R): (3, 2)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because it's the reverse of Down.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (2, 1)**:\n   - Is (2, 1) a valid move?\n     - Not a wall: x=2 is not a border, y=1 is not a border, and (2,1) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not colliding with body:\n       - Snake body segments are at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (2,1) is not in this list.\n   - Food at (2,1): Yes, there's positive food with value 1.\n     - Eating it: head moves to (2,1), length increases by 1, new tail is where the old tail was (but the tail moves forward).\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The new tail would be the segment that was at (2,3) after the move (since the snake grows by one). The head is at (2,1), adjacent to (2,2) (old head), not directly adjacent to the new tail at (2,3). So no immediate collision.\n   - Seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (1, 2)**:\n   - Is (1, 2) valid?\n     - Not a wall: x=1, y=2 are not borders, not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not colliding with body: (1,2) is not in the body segments.\n   - No food at (1,2).\n   - Safe move but no immediate benefit.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (3, 2)**:\n   - Is (3, 2) valid?\n     - Not a wall: x=3, y=2 are not borders, not an internal obstacle (internal obstacle is at (5,2)).\n     - Not colliding with body: (3,2) is not in the body segments.\n   - No food at (3,2).\n   - Safe move but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Evaluating Food at Tail (4,5)\n\nThe food at (4,5) is under the tail. To eat it:\n- The tail must move away first, then the head must move onto (4,5).\n- Currently, the tail is at (4,5), so the food is under the tail.\n- Next turn, the tail will move forward (assuming the snake doesn't grow), so the food would be exposed.\n- But to eat it, the head would have to move to (4,5) after the tail moves, which would take multiple moves from the current position.\n- Not immediately accessible, so not a priority now.\n\n### Evaluating Food on Body (2,3)\n\nFood at (2,3) is under the snake's body (second segment).\n- To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (2,3), then the head must move onto it.\n- Currently, the segment at (2,3) is part of the body, so the head cannot move there directly.\n- Not immediately accessible.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Down (D) to (2,1): Eats positive food, safe, increases length.\n- Left (L) or Right (R): Safe but no immediate gain.\n\nEating the food at (2,1) seems the best immediate action.\n\n### Checking for Potential Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving Down to (2,1):\n- New head: (2,1)\n- New body: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n  - Length increases by 1, so the tail stays where it was (but the tail moves forward, so the new tail is the old (2,3)).\n- Next possible moves from (2,1):\n  - Cannot move Up (reverse of Down).\n  - Left to (1,1)\n  - Right to (3,1)\n  - Down to (2,0) - but y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n  - So next would have to choose between Left or Right, both safe unless there's food under the tail then, but that's future planning.\n\nNo immediate danger seen after this move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the positive food at (2,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

According to the rules, we cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn, so Up is invalid even if it were safe.\n\n**Checking Left (L) - (1, 1)**:\n- Walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=1 is not.\n- Body segments: Checking the snake's body positions, (1, 1) is not in the list. So, it's safe.\n  \n**Checking Right (R) - (3, 1)**:\n- Walls: x=7 is a wall, x=3 is not.\n- Body segments: (3, 1) is not in the body positions. So, it's safe.\n\nSo, the possible safe moves are Left (L) and Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to decide which move might be more beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (4, 5)**:\n   - Value: 3\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position: The snake's head is at (2, 1), and this food is at (4, 5). \n   - Distance: To reach (4,5) from (2,1), the snake would need to move right twice and up four times, which is not possible in one move. So, this food is not reachable immediately.\n\n2. **Food at (2, 3)**:\n   - Value: 9\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position: The snake's body is at (2, 3). \n   - According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away (i.e., the segment at (2,3) moves), and\n     - The head moves onto the food cell (2,3).\n   - Currently, the body segment at (2,3) is part of the snake's body following the head. For the head to reach (2,3), it would have to move up to (2,2) first, but (2,2) is occupied by the body, so moving up is invalid (collision). \n   - Therefore, the food at (2,3) cannot be eaten this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n  \nIn the current state:\n- Tail is at (4,5).\n- Adjacent cells to the tail:\n  - Up: (4,6) — body segment\n  - Down: (4,4) — not occupied\n  - Left: (3,5) — body segment\n  - Right: (5,5) — not occupied\n- Head is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1 cell in both x and y). So, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Right\n\nSince both Left and Right are safe moves, and neither food can be eaten this turn, the choice doesn't directly impact the immediate score. However, we might consider future possibilities:\n\n- **Left (L) to (1,1)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the left side of the board.\n  - Next possible moves from (1,1): Up (1,2), Down (1,0) — wall, Left (0,1) — wall, Right (2,1) — body.\n  - Only Up would be safe next turn.\n\n- **Right (R) to (3,1)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the right side.\n  - Next possible moves from (3,1): Up (3,2), Down (3,0) — wall, Left (2,1) — body, Right (4,1).\n  - Up and Right would be safe next turn.\n\nMoving Right seems to offer more flexibility in the next move compared to moving Left.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately by moving Left or Right?\n\n- Moving Left to (1,1): No food there.\n- Moving Right to (3,1): No food there.\n\nNeither move allows eating food this turn.\n\n### Considering Food Life Spans\n\nBoth foods have a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. However, as established, neither can be eaten this turn due to their positions relative to the snake.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both Left and Right are safe, and Right offers more flexibility for the next move, the better immediate action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail:\n     - Head: (3, 1)\n     - Body: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6)]\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - **Positive Food at (4, 5)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 2\n   - **Positive Food at (2, 3)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- The snake's head is at (3, 1), moving Right (R).\n- The body segments are:\n  - (2, 1) - immediately behind the head (left of head)\n  - (2, 2) - below (2,1)\n  - (2, 3) - below (2,2)\n  - (2, 4) - below (2,3)\n  - (2, 5) - below (2,4)\n  - (3, 5) - right of (2,5)\n  - (3, 6) - above (3,5)\n  - (4, 6) - right of (3,6)\n  \nFood:\n- (4, 5): This is to the right and below the head's current position.\n- (2, 3): This is part of the snake's body (the third segment).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is moving Right (R), it cannot move Left (L) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n2. **Wall Collision**: Cannot move into walls.\n   - Moving Right (R): (4,1) - Check if this is a wall. x=4 is not a border wall, and (4,1) is not an internal wall. Also, is (4,1) part of the snake's body? No, the body is at (2,1), (2,2), etc., not (4,1).\n   - Moving Up (U): (3,2) - Not a wall, not a body segment (body is at (2,1), etc., (3,2) is free.\n   - Moving Down (D): (3,0) - y=0 is a border wall, so cannot move Down.\n\nSo, possible moves: Right (R), Up (U).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Option 1: Right (R) to (4,1)**\n- New head position: (4,1)\n- Check for food at (4,1): No, food is at (4,5) and (2,3).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: Does (4,1) overlap with any body segment? No.\n  - Walls: Not a wall.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**Option 2: Up (U) to (3,2)**\n- New head position: (3,2)\n- Check for food at (3,2): No.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: Does (3,2) overlap with any body segment? No.\n  - Walls: Not a wall.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**Option 3: Down (D) to (3,0)**\n- y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's consider the food:\n\n1. **Food at (4,5)**:\n   - Current position: (3,1)\n   - To reach (4,5), need to move right and up.\n   - Distance: Δx=1, Δy=4.\n   - Life Span: 2 turns. So, it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n   - **Cannot reach it in time**: Even if we move right now, it's too far.\n\n2. **Food at (2,3)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body (third segment).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away (i.e., the tail moves forward).\n     - Then, the head must move onto (2,3).\n   - Current tail is at (4,6). Next move will move tail to (3,6), but (2,3) is not the tail, so it's not directly accessible.\n   - Also, the food is under the body, not the tail, so cannot be eaten this turn.\n   - Even if we try to reach it, it's not adjacent to the head now.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (4,6). Head is at (3,1), not adjacent to (4,6), so no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,1) is safe.\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,2) is safe.\n- Cannot reach any food this turn.\n- No immediate danger from tail or walls.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- Moving Right (R) keeps the snake moving in the same direction, possibly towards the right side where there's more space.\n- Moving Up (U) starts moving upwards, but the snake is long and might box itself in.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's currently forming a sort of \"L\" shape with the head at (3,1) and the body going left and then up. Moving Right seems safer to avoid getting boxed in by its own body.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, the safest move is to continue moving Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

No.\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 3.

Not reachable in one move.\n2. **Food at (2,3)**:\n   - Currently part of the snake's body at position (2,3).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away, and the head must move onto it.\n   - Currently, the head is at (4,1), moving to (2,3) in one move isn't possible (would require moving left twice, which isn't allowed in one move).\n   - Also, even if we could, the tail is at (3,6), not adjacent to head, so no tail reward danger here, but can't reach in one move.\n3. **Food at (5,4)**:\n   - From (4,1), can't reach in one move (would need to go right then up, or up then right, etc.).\n\nNone of the foods are directly reachable in the next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nEven though no food is directly reachable, let's check if any food is adjacent to the tail that could cause danger if we move towards it.\n\n- Tail is at (3,6).\n- Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - (2,6), (4,6), (3,5), (3,7) [but y=7 is wall]\n- Food at these positions? No.\n  \nSo no tail reward danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Right (R) to (5,1): safe, no food.\n- Up (U) to (4,2): safe, no food.\n- Down (D): invalid.\n\nBoth R and U are safe but don't lead to food. Which is better?\n\nLooking at the snake's body and future movements:\n- Moving Right takes us towards the center (x increases).\n- Moving Up takes us towards the top.\n\nThe snake's body is mostly on the left side (x=2,3), so moving Right might be better to explore more space.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up could be better to avoid getting boxed in near the top wall (y=7), but currently at y=1, so plenty of space.\n\nGiven that, both moves seem equally safe with no immediate benefit. Maybe prefer Right to continue in the current direction unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nBut looking at the food at (5,4), moving Right now could set us up to go Up next turn to approach that food.\n\nSimilarly, moving Up now could set us to go Right next turn to approach (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) is high value (10), so maybe prioritize setting up to reach that.\n\nIf we move Up now to (4,2), next turn from (4,2), can move Right to (5,2), but (5,2) is a wall, so can't. Then next options would be Up to (4,3) or Down to (4,1) (but (4,1) is body).\n\nAlternatively, if we move Right now to (5,1), next turn from (5,1), can move Up to (5,2) - but (5,2) is wall, so can't. Can move Right to (6,1) or Down to (5,0) - wall.\n\nHmm, both initial moves seem to lead to limited options next turn.\n\nBut moving Right to (5,1) then can move Right to (6,1), which is safe (no walls or body), then maybe can go Up to (6,2), etc., heading towards (5,4).\n\nMoving Up to (4,2) seems to box us in more.\n\nTherefore, **Right (R)** seems the better immediate move to eventually reach the high-value food at (5,4).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering future paths to reach high-value food while avoiding collisions, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

No internal wall at (6,1).\n   - Check for body collision: The body segments are at (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), etc. (6,1) is not in the body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: Next position would be (5,2).\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is the top wall, y=2 is not a wall.\n   - Internal obstacle at (5,2): **This is a wall**, so cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: Next position would be (5,0).\n   - Check for walls: y=0 is a wall.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n4. **Reverse Left (L)**: Opposite of current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Right (R)**.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's consider the food:\n\n1. **Food at (2,3)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body (at segment (2,3)).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (2,3), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the head is at (5,1), so it's not adjacent to (2,3).\n     - Even if we move right to (6,1), the body will move, but the segment at (2,3) will move to (2,4) (since the tail is at (3,5), and the segment before it is (2,5), which will move to (3,5), etc. It's complex, but the head is not near (2,3) in the next move.\n     - Also, the life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. So, we can't eat it now.\n   - Not a concern for immediate action.\n\n2. **Food at (5,4)**:\n   - Currently at (5,4), which is above the head at (5,1).\n   - Distance: y-coordinate difference is 3.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n   - To reach it, we'd need to move up, but moving up is blocked by the wall at (5,2).\n   - So, we cannot eat this food in this turn.\n   - It will disappear after this turn, so no need to consider it further.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving right to (6,1)?\n\n- **Body Collision**: The body segments are at (4,1), (3,1), etc. (6,1) is not in the body.\n- **Wall Collision**: x=6 is not a wall (x=7 is).\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: \n  - The tail is at (3,5), which is far from the head.\n  - No food is at the tail's position (tail is at (3,5), food is at (2,3) and (5,4)).\n  - So, no danger of eating food at the tail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid move is **Right (R)**, and it's safe:\n- No immediate collisions.\n- No food can be eaten this turn due to positions and life_spans.\n- No other directions are possible due to walls or reverse movement restriction.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Game State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what the constraints are.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: These are at x=0, x=7, y=0, and y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5, 2). This means the snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)].\n     - Head is at (6, 1).\n     - The next segment is at (5, 1), which means the snake is currently moving to the left (since the head is to the right of the next segment). But wait, the head direction is given as \"R\" (right), which seems contradictory because if the head is at (6,1) and the next segment is at (5,1), the snake was moving left (L) to reach (6,1) from (5,1). This discrepancy needs clarification.\n     - However, the **Snake Head Direction** is explicitly given as \"R\" (right). This likely means the snake is currently facing right, regardless of its previous movement. So, the last move was to the right, placing the head at (6,1) from (5,1), which would mean the previous direction was left. This seems inconsistent, but we'll proceed with the given direction \"R\".\n   - **Length**: The snake has 9 segments.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - (2, 3): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     - (5, 4): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - Both foods have a positive value (+1), and their life spans are 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is \"R\" (right), the snake cannot move left (\"L\") in the next turn.\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, R\n   - Disallowed move: L\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - Current head position: (6, 1)\n   - Possible moves from (6,1):\n     - U: (6, 2) - Check for walls/obstacles:\n       - y=2 is not a border wall.\n       - (6,2) is not listed as an internal obstacle (only (5,2) is).\n       - Not part of the snake's body (checking snake positions: the body is at y=1 and some at y=2,3,4,5 but x=2,3,4,5,6; (6,2) is not in the body list).\n       - So, U is safe.\n     - D: (6, 0) - y=0 is a border wall. So, D is invalid (wall collision).\n     - R: (7, 1) - x=7 is a border wall. So, R is invalid (wall collision).\n     - L: (5, 1) - But L is disallowed due to no instant reverse (current direction is R).\n   - So, the only possible move is U.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the no instant reverse rule. The rule states: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is \"R\", so opposite is \"L\". So, L is disallowed, but U, D, R are allowed. But R leads to a wall, D leads to a wall, so only U is valid.\n\nHowever, let's also consider if U leads to any immediate collision with the body or tail.\n\n### Checking Move U (6,2):\n\n- New head position: (6,2)\n- Current body segments (excluding the tail which will move): [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]\n- After moving, the tail (2,5) will move forward, so the new body will be [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (2,4)].\n- Is (6,2) in the current body? No, the body is at y=1 and some at y=2,3,4,5 but x=2,3,4,5,6; (6,2) is not in the list.\n- So, no body collision.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's see if moving U can lead to eating food:\n\n1. Food at (2,3):\n   - Distance from (6,1) to (2,3): |6-2| + |1-3| = 4 + 2 = 6. Not adjacent, cannot reach in one move.\n2. Food at (5,4):\n   - Distance from (6,1) to (5,4): |6-5| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4. Not adjacent, cannot reach in one move.\n\nNeither food is adjacent to the current head, so no food can be eaten this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food:\n- Tail is at (2,5).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6) - but y=6 is a wall.\n- Head is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to (2,5). So, no danger here.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. But since we can't reach either in one move, they will disappear regardless of our action.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- Only possible move without collision is U.\n- No food can be eaten this turn.\n- No immediate dangers from tail or body.\n\nTherefore, the only safe and valid move is Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Up (U) to (6, 3)\n- Check if (6, 3) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: Borders are at y=7, so y=3 is fine; x=6 is not a border.\n  - Not an internal obstacle: Only obstacle is at (5, 2), so clear.\n  - Not part of the snake's body: Let's check the snake positions:\n    - Snake segments: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n    - (6,3) is not in this list, so safe.\n- Food at (6,3)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5, 2)\n- Check if (5, 2) is valid:\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (5, 2) is an obstacle! So cannot move here.\n- Outcome: Invalid move (hits obstacle).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7, 2)\n- Check if (7, 2) is valid:\n  - Border walls: x=7 is a border wall.\n  - So this is a wall collision.\n- Outcome: Invalid move (hits wall).\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only valid move is Up (U) to (6, 3). Left and Right are invalid due to obstacle and wall respectively.\n\nBut wait, is there any food adjacent to the tail that we need to be careful about?\n\n**Tail Position:** (2, 4)\n**Adjacent to Tail:** Positions adjacent to (2,4) are:\n- (1,4), (3,4), (2,5), (2,3)\n  \nIs the head adjacent to the tail?

So no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (2,3): value=5, life=1\n   - At (2,3), which is part of the snake's body (from positions: ..., (2,3), ...). So cannot eat this unless the body moves away and head moves onto it. Currently, the body is there, so can't eat now.\n2. (5,4): value=7, life=1\n   - Not under snake, can consider moving towards it.\n3. (6,6): value=10, life=1\n   - Not under snake, can consider moving towards it.\n\nBut currently, the only possible move is Up to (6,3). Next turn, if we're at (6,3), we can consider moving towards (6,6) or (5,4).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt Turn 40, the only valid move is Up (U) to (6,3).

Food at (2,3) - tail's current position.\n   - To eat this, the head must move to (2,3) when the tail moves away.\n   - Currently, tail is at (2,3), next it will move to (2,2) if snake moves.\n   - So, to eat (2,3), head must be adjacent to (2,3) now and move to it next turn.\n   - Currently, head is at (6,3), not adjacent to (2,3) (distance is 4 in x), so can't eat this now.\n   - Also, life_span is 1, so next turn it will disappear. So this food is not reachable.\n\n2. Food at (5,4):\n   - Current head at (6,3). To reach (5,4):\n     - From (6,3), can go L to (5,3), then U to (5,4).\n     - But life_span is 1, so next turn it disappears. So can't reach it in time.\n   - Alternatively, from (6,3), U to (6,4), then L to (5,4).\n     - But again, life_span is 1, disappears next turn, so can't reach in time.\n   - So this food is also not reachable.\n\n3. Food at (6,6):\n   - Current head at (6,3). To reach (6,6):\n     - Need to move up three times: U to (6,4), U to (6,5), U to (6,6).\n     - Life_span is 9, so plenty of time.\n   - But currently, can't reach it immediately.\n   - Next turn, if we go U now to (6,4), then can consider moving towards (6,6).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the new tail (after growing) would collide with the head.\n- Currently, tail is at (2,3), head at (6,3) - not adjacent (distance is 4 in x), so no danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nBoth U and L are safe moves with no immediate reward. \n\nLooking ahead:\n- If we go U to (6,4), next turn can go U to (6,5), then U to (6,6) to eat the food at (6,6).\n- If we go L to (5,3), next moves could be towards (5,4) but that food disappears next turn, or other directions, but not directly towards remaining food.\n\nThe food at (6,6) is the only one that can be reached eventually, so moving towards it seems best.\n\nBetween U and L:\n- U moves directly towards (6,6).\n- L moves away from it.\n\nSo, U is the better choice to eventually reach (6,6).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers with U\n\nMove U to (6,4):\n- Next turn, head at (6,4), direction U.\n- Possible moves then: U (to (6,5)), L (to (5,4)), R (to (7,4) - wall, invalid).\n- Then can go U to (6,5), then U to (6,6) to eat the food.\n- No immediate collisions or dangers in this path.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to position (6,4), setting up to reach the positive food at (6,6) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 42  \n**Grid Dimensions**: It seems like the grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Walls**:  \n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).  \n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2) — can't move here.  \n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (6, 4), followed by body segments:  \n(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  \n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U).  \n\n**Food Items**:  \n1. (2, 3): value = 3, life_span = 1  \n2. (5, 4): value = 5, life_span = 1  \n3. (6, 6): value = 8, life_span = 1  \n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,4) moving Up (U), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (6,5)  \n- **Left (L)**: (5,4)  \n- **Right (R)**: (7,4) — but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.  \n- **Down (D)**: (6,3) — but this is the immediate body segment, and moving into your own body is deadly unless it's the tail which will move away. Here, (6,3) is not the tail (tail is at (2,2)), so this is a body collision — invalid.  \n\nSo, valid immediate moves are U or L. Cannot move R or D.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (6,5)**  \n- Check for food at (6,5): No food listed there.  \n- Check for collisions:  \n  - (6,5) is not a wall or body segment (from current positions).  \n  - Next positions after move: head at (6,5), body follows: (6,4), (6,3), ..., tail at (6,1) moves away, so no immediate collision.  \n- No immediate reward or penalty.  \n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (5,4)**  \n- Check for food at (5,4): Yes, food with value=5, life_span=1.  \n- Can we eat this food?  \n  - The food is not under the snake's body (snake is at (6,4), (6,3), etc., not at (5,4)).  \n  - So, moving head to (5,4) would eat the food.  \n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger:  \n    - Current tail is at (2,2). Is (5,4) adjacent to (2,2)?  \n    - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.  \n    - (5,4) and (2,2): x diff is 3, y diff is 2 — not adjacent.  \n    - So, no danger from tail.  \n  - Eating this food:  \n    - Value is +5 (positive), so length increases by 1, score +5.  \n    - New head at (5,4), body extends to include old head (6,4), etc.  \n    - Tail was at (2,2), now new tail is at (2,1) (since length increases by 1, tail doesn't move).  \n- Is (5,4) safe to move to?  \n  - Not a wall or body segment (current body is at (6,4), (6,3), etc., not (5,4)).  \n  - No collision.  \n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Move U (6,5)**: No reward, safe move.  \n- **Move L (5,4)**: Eat food with +5, safe move.  \n\nClearly, moving Left to eat the +5 food is better than moving Up with no reward.\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\n- **Food Lifespans**: All foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear next turn if not eaten now.  \n  - (2,3): value=3  \n  - (5,4): value=5  \n  - (6,6): value=8  \n- Is there a way to reach higher-value food?  \n  - (6,6): To reach from (6,4), need to go U to (6,5), then U to (6,6). But food will disappear next turn, so can't reach in time.  \n  - (2,3): Currently at (6,4), distance is |6-2| + |4-3| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps away. Can't reach in 1 turn.  \n  - So, only (5,4) is reachable now.  \n\n- **Immediate Reverse Rule**: Current direction is U. Opposite is D, which is invalid (into body). So no restriction here.  \n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving Left to (5,4):  \n- After eating, snake grows, new tail is at (2,1).  \n- Next moves: need to ensure we don't get stuck.  \n- But for immediate action, seems safe.  \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (5,4) to eat the positive food with value +5, which is safe and maximizes the current turn's score.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 43  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: (5, 2) is a wall cell where the snake cannot go.  \n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:  \n- Head: (5, 4)  \n- Body segments: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  \n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L).  \n**Food Items**:  \n1.

Move Up (U) to (5,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top border, so (5,5) is safe.\n  - Body segments: Check if (5,5) is in the snake's body. Current body positions:  \n    (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) — (5,5) is not here.\n  - Obstacle: (5,2) is an obstacle, but we're going to (5,5), so safe.\n- Food at (5,5)? No, the foods are at (2,3), (6,6), (3,5).\n- After moving, the tail (last segment) moves away, so the new body will be:\n  - New head: (5,5)\n  - Body: (5,4), (6,4), ..., up to (2,2) minus the last segment (since length increases only if eating positive food; no food eaten here, so length stays same, tail moves away).\n  \nThis move seems safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (5,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is bottom, (5,3) is safe.\n  - Body segments: Is (5,3) in the body?  \n    Looking at body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) — (6,3) is at y=3, but x=6 ≠ 5, so (5,3) is safe.\n  - Obstacle: (5,2) is below, but we're at (5,3), safe.\n- Food at (5,3)? No.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L) to (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left border, (4,4) is safe.\n  - Body segments: Is (4,4) in the body?  \n    Current body: (6,4), (6,3), ..., (2,2) — (6,4) is at y=4 but x=6 ≠ 4, next is (5,1), etc., so (4,4) is safe.\n  - Obstacle: (5,2) is not at (4,4), safe.\n- Food at (4,4)? No.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNone of the immediate moves land on food. But let's see if moving towards food is possible without immediate reward.\n\nFoods:\n1. (2,3) - value 2, life_span 1 (will disappear next turn)\n2. (6,6) - value 7, life_span 1\n3. (3,5) - value 10, life_span 1\n\nAll foods have life_span 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn unless eaten now.\n\nBut none are adjacent to the head (5,4):\n- (2,3): distance |5-2| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (6,6): |5-6| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (3,5): |5-3| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nCan't reach any food in one move. So this turn, we can't eat any food; they'll all disappear after this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food:\n- Tail is at (2,2).\n- Adjacent to head (5,4)? Manhattan distance: |5-2| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- Also, tail is at (2,2), and food is at (2,3), which is adjacent to tail, but not under tail. So no danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, the priority is to stay alive and position ourselves for future food. All three possible moves (U, D, L) are safe. \n\nWhich is best?\n- Moving Up (U) to (5,5): heads towards center, away from walls.\n- Moving Down (D) to (5,3): moves towards the bottom, but not into danger.\n- Moving Left (L) to (4,4): continues left, but we're already at x=5, moving left is okay.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving left might be slightly better as it's moving away from the long body stretch on the right (from (6,4) down to (6,1)). Moving up or down could eventually lead to getting boxed in by the body.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAll moves are safe, but moving Left continues the current direction and seems to keep options open for future moves without boxing ourselves in.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(2, 3): Value = 1, Life Span = 1\n2. (6, 6): Value = 6, Life Span = 1\n3. (3, 5): Value = 9, Life Span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Collision Checks**:\n   - **Body Collision**: The head cannot move into any cell occupied by the snake's body, except the tail (since the tail will move forward in the next turn).\n   - **Wall Collision**: Cannot move into any wall cell.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### Current Head Position: (4, 4)\n\n1. **Move Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (3, 4)\n   - Check if (3, 4) is occupied by body or is a wall.\n   - Body positions: Looking at the snake's body segments, (3, 1) is the only segment with x=3, but y=1 ≠ 4. So, (3, 4) is not occupied by body.\n   - Walls: (3, 4) is not a border wall (x≠0,7; y≠0,7) and not an internal wall (internal wall is at (5, 2)).\n   - **Valid Move**: Yes.\n\n2. **Move Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (4, 5)\n   - Check (4, 5):\n     - Body segments: (4, 1), (4, 4). (4, 5) is not occupied.\n     - Walls: Not a wall.\n   - **Valid Move**: Yes.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (4, 3)\n   - Check (4, 3):\n     - Body segments: None at (4, 3).\n     - Walls: Not a wall.\n   - **Valid Move**: Yes.\n\n4. **Move Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (5, 4)\n   - Instant reverse: Current direction is Left, so Right is opposite → **Invalid Move**.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: L, U, D.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility and Safety\n\nNow, let's see which moves can potentially lead to eating food safely.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2, 3): Value = +1, Life Span = 1\n   - Distance from head (4, 4): Manhattan distance = |4-2| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - To reach (2, 3) in 1 turn (since life span is 1), impossible (need at least 3 moves).\n   - **Will disappear next turn**, so not reachable now.\n\n2. (6, 6): Value = +6, Life Span = 1\n   - Distance: |4-6| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Cannot reach in 1 turn (life span = 1), will disappear next turn.\n   - **Not reachable now**.\n\n3. (3, 5): Value = +9, Life Span = 1\n   - Distance: |4-3| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Can reach in 2 moves, but life span is 1 → will disappear next turn.\n   - **Not reachable now**.\n\n**Conclusion on Food**: None of the food items can be eaten in the current turn because their life spans are 1, and they are all at least distance 2 away from the head.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nEven though no food is reachable this turn, we should still check if any move would place the head adjacent to the tail where the tail has positive food. \n\n- **Tail Position**: Last segment is (2, 1).\n- **Adjacent to Tail**: Positions adjacent to (2, 1) are:\n  - (1, 1), (3, 1), (2, 0), (2, 2)\n  \nCurrent head is at (4, 4). Possible moves:\n- L to (3, 4): Not adjacent to tail.\n- U to (4, 5): Not adjacent.\n- D to (4, 3): Not adjacent.\n\nNo move brings the head adjacent to the tail, so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Checking Future Collisions\n\nWe should also ensure that the chosen move doesn't lead to a dead end or immediate collision in the next turn.\n\nLet's consider each valid move:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (3, 4)**:\n   - New head: (3, 4)\n   - New body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), ...]\n   - Next possible moves from (3, 4):\n     - Current direction: L (but next move can be U, D, or continue L, no R)\n     - Check surroundings:\n       - L: (2, 4) - not wall or body (body at (2,1))\n       - U: (3, 5) - not wall or body\n       - D: (3, 3) - not wall or body\n   - Seems safe, multiple options next turn.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4, 5)**:\n   - New head: (4, 5)\n   - New body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), ...]\n   - Next possible moves from (4, 5):\n     - Current direction: U\n     - Cannot move D (reverse)\n     - Possible: L, R, U\n     - Check:\n       - U: (4, 6) - not wall or body\n       - L: (3, 5) - not wall or body\n       - R: (5, 5) - not wall or body\n   - Also safe, multiple options.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4, 3)**:\n   - New head: (4, 3)\n   - New body: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), ...]\n   - Next possible moves from (4, 3):\n     - Current direction: D\n     - Cannot move U (reverse)\n     - Possible: L, R, D\n     - Check:\n       - D: (4, 2) - not wall (but internal wall at (5,2), but (4,2) is clear)\n       - L: (3, 3) - not wall or body\n       - R: (5, 3) - not wall or body\n   - Also safe.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, the primary goal is to avoid collisions and keep the snake alive, ideally moving towards areas where future food might be accessible.\n\nLooking at the current body and possible moves:\n- Moving Left (L) to (3, 4) takes the snake towards the left side where there's more space (less body concentration on the left).\n- Moving Up (U) to (4, 5) moves towards the top, but the body is more concentrated towards the bottom.\n- Moving Down (D) to (4, 3) moves towards the bottom where there's more body segments, potentially leading to tighter spaces in the future.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems the safest as it moves the snake towards a less congested area.\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement\n\nOne thing to ensure is that moving left doesn't cause the head to collide with the moving tail. The tail is at (2,1), and after the move, the tail will move forward from (2,1) to the next segment's previous position, which is (3,1). \n\nNew head at (3,4) and new tail at (3,1) - no collision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest move is to continue moving Left (L), as it keeps the snake in a less congested area and doesn't lead to any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (2, 4)\n   - Check if (2,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=2 is not a border wall, and (2,4) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n     - Not colliding with body: Check if (2,4) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Current body segments: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n       - (2,4) is not in this list → safe.\n     - Not opposite direction: Current direction is L, so moving L is allowed (not opposite).\n\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3, 5)\n   - Check (3,5):\n     - Not a wall: y=5 is not a border, and no internal obstacle at (3,5).\n     - Not colliding with body: (3,5) is not in body segments.\n     - Not opposite direction: Current is L, U is not opposite (opposite of L is R).\n     - Food at (3,5): value=8, life_span=1.\n       - Eating this food would increase length by 1 and score by 8.\n       - Need to check Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is the tail cell positive food?\n         - Tail is at (3,1). Head is at (3,4). Distance is |4-1|=3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n         - So no danger from tail reward.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3, 3)\n   - Check (3,3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in body segments.\n     - Not opposite direction.\n     - No food here.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (2,4)**:\n   - No food there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (3,5)**:\n   - Eats positive food with high value (8).\n   - Safe from collisions.\n   - No tail reward danger.\n   - High reward.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (3,3)**:\n   - No food.\n   - Safe but no reward.\n\nBetween these, moving Up to eat the high-value food at (3,5) seems optimal.\n\n### Checking Other Constraints\n\n- **Food Life Span**: Both foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n  - So if we don't eat (3,5) now, it's gone.\n  - Similarly for (6,6), but it's far away and not reachable in one move.\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is L, so cannot move R next turn. But we're not considering R here.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in moving to (3,5)?\n\n- After moving to (3,5), the snake's new head is at (3,5), and the body grows by one segment (since we ate food).\n- The new body would be:\n  - Head: (3,5)\n  - Body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n- Next possible moves from (3,5):\n  - U: (3,6) - but y=7 is a wall, so y=6 is safe (unless it's a wall, but y=7 is the border, y=6 is not a wall).\n    - (3,6) is not in the new body.\n  - D: (3,4) - but that's the first body segment → collision.\n  - L: (2,5) - need to check if it's safe.\n  - R: (4,5) - need to check if it's safe.\n  \nSo after eating, moving U is safe next turn, but D would be deadly. But that's a concern for the next turn, not now.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Moving Left to (2,4)\n\nIf we move left to (2,4):\n\n- No food eaten.\n- Next head position: (2,4)\n- Possible next moves:\n  - Continue L: (1,4)\n  - U: (2,5)\n  - D: (2,3)\n  \nBut we miss the high-value food at (3,5), which is a significant opportunity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (3,5) to eat the high-value food (value=8) before it disappears, as it's safe and provides the highest reward.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (cannot move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n     - Head at (3,5), direction is Up (U).\n     - Length is 11 segments.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (5,5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5) with direction Up (U), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3,6) — but y=6 is within bounds (y=7 is wall), need to check for collisions.\n- **Left (L)**: (2,5) — x=2 is within bounds (x=0 is wall), need to check for collisions.\n- **Right (R)**: (4,5) — x=4 is within bounds (x=7 is wall), need to check for collisions.\n- **Down (D)**: (3,4) — but this is the opposite of current direction (U), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Checking Each Move for Collisions\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3,6)**:\n   - Check if (3,6) is occupied by snake body or wall.\n     - Snake body positions: all segments are below y=5 except the head is at y=5, so y=6 is clear.\n     - Walls: y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not a wall.\n   - Safe to move Up.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,5)**:\n   - Check (2,5):\n     - Not in snake body (all x >=3 or y !=5).\n     - Not a wall (x=0 is wall, x=2 is not).\n   - Safe to move Left.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check (4,5):\n     - Snake body: (4,4) is at y=4, so (4,5) is clear.\n     - Walls: x=7 is wall, x=4 is not.\n   - Safe to move Right.\n\n### Evaluating Food Access\n\nNow, let's see if any food is accessible in the next move:\n\n1. **Food at (6,6)**:\n   - Current head at (3,5). To reach (6,6), need to move:\n     - Right thrice (to x=6) and Up once (to y=6).\n     - Not reachable in one move.\n2. **Food at (5,5)**:\n   - Current head at (3,5). To reach (5,5), need to move:\n     - Right twice (to x=5) and no change in y.\n     - Not reachable in one move.\n\nNeither food is directly reachable in the next move, so the immediate goal is to position the snake to potentially reach food in future moves while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Considering Future Moves and Tail Position\n\nThe snake's tail is at (3,1). The segment before the tail is (4,1). \n\nThere's a potential danger if the head moves adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, but currently, the tail is at (3,1), which is far from the head at (3,5), so no immediate danger from that.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately reachable, we should choose a move that:\n- Keeps the snake safe (no collisions).\n- Positions the snake to potentially reach food soon.\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. Current head is at (3,5). Moving Right would get us closer to (5,5).\n- (6,6) is at x=6,y=6. Moving Up then Right could be a path, but it's further.\n\nBetween U, L, R:\n- U (3,6): Moves away from both foods.\n- L (2,5): Moves away from both foods.\n- R (4,5): Moves closer to (5,5).\n\nMoving Right seems the best as it gets us closer to the higher value food (10 at (5,5)) compared to (5 at (6,6)).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Moving Right\n\nAfter moving Right to (4,5):\n- New head: (4,5)\n- New body: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), ..., (3,1)]\n- Check if (4,5) collides with any body part:\n  - (3,5) is the next segment, which is adjacent but not overlapping.\n  - Other body parts are below y=5.\n- No collision.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nTail is at (3,1), head moving to (4,5). No adjacency between new head and tail, so no danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to position the snake closer to the higher value food at (5,5) while avoiding any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move D (Down) to (4,4)\n- Check (4,4):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Part of the snake body: (4,4) is the 4th segment in the list.\n- Collision with body is deadly unless it's the tail.\n- The tail is at (4,1), so (4,4) is not the tail.\n- Therefore, moving to (4,4) would collide with the body → death.\n- **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 3. Move R (Right) to (5,5)\n- Check (5,5):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not part of the snake body.\n  - Food present: (5,5) has food with value 9.\n- Check if eating is safe:\n  - Eating increases length by 1 (from 11 to 12).\n  - New tail will be the current tail's next position. Current tail is at (4,1). The segment before tail is (5,1). So when the snake moves, the tail moves from (4,1) to (5,1), and the new tail will be (5,1).\n  - After eating, the head is at (5,5), new tail at (5,1), so no immediate collision.\n  - But need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\": Is the head adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food?\n    - Current tail is at (4,1), new head at (5,5).

But it's at (6,6), which is not reachable in one move from (4,5). So we can't get it now.\n- The other food at (5,5) also has life_span 1, so if we don't eat it now, it disappears next turn.

Hence, collision.\n     - Invalid move.\n\n4. **Turn Left (L)**: (4,5)\n   - Check (4,5):\n     - Directly behind the head is the first body segment (4,5).\n     - Moving left would reverse the direction (from R to L), which is not allowed.\n     - Also, it would collide with the body.\n     - Invalid move.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are R and U.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate R and U based on food and potential risks.\n\n**Food at (6,6)**:\n- Value: +1 (positive food).\n- Life span: 3 (will disappear after 3 more turns, including current turn).\n- Currently at (5,5). To reach (6,6):\n  - Path 1: R to (6,5), then U to (6,6) — 2 moves.\n  - Path 2: U to (5,6), then R to (6,6) — 2 moves.\n- Both paths take 2 moves, but the food's life span is 3, so it will disappear after turn 50 (current is 48). So, we can reach it by turn 50.\n\nBut we're deciding the immediate move at turn 48.\n\n**Option 1: Move Right (R) to (6,5)**\n- Next turn (49), from (6,5), can move U to (6,6) to eat the food.\n- Check for dangers:\n  - At (6,5), is there any immediate danger?\n    - Adjacent cells: \n      - (7,5): x=7 is a wall — cannot move further right.\n      - (6,6): food, no danger.\n      - (5,5): head's previous position, now body segment (if we move R, the body moves).\n      - (6,4): part of the snake's body (7th segment).\n    - So, moving to (6,5) is safe; no immediate collision.\n- After moving U to (6,6) at turn 49:\n  - Eating the food: length increases by 1, new tail is where the old tail was (4,1) moves to (?,?) — need to see.\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail when eating?\n    - At turn 49, tail is at (4,1), head at (6,6) — not adjacent (distance is more than 1).\n    - So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n**Option 2: Move Up (U) to (5,6)**\n- Next turn (49), from (5,6), can move R to (6,6) to eat the food.\n- Check for dangers:\n  - At (5,6), is there any immediate danger?\n    - Adjacent cells:\n      - (5,7): y=7 is a wall — cannot move further up.\n      - (6,6): food.\n      - (5,5): head's previous position.\n      - (4,6): not part of the snake's body.\n    - Safe move.\n- After moving R to (6,6) at turn 49:\n  - Eating the food: same as above, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Comparing Both Options\n\nBoth paths lead to eating the food safely. Is one better than the other?\n\n- Moving R first:\n  - After (6,5), next move is U to (6,6).\n  - Then, the snake's head is at (6,6), body extends.\n  - Possible next moves from (6,6): \n    - U to (6,7) — wall (y=7), invalid.\n    - D to (6,5) — but (6,5) is now part of the body (since tail moved, need to check).\n    - L to (5,6) — possible.\n    - R to (7,6) — wall (x=7), invalid.\n  - So, from (6,6), can only move L to (5,6).\n\n- Moving U first:\n  - After (5,6), next move is R to (6,6).\n  - Then, from (6,6), same as above: can only move L to (5,6).\n\nBoth sequences lead to the same position after eating the food, with limited next moves. \n\nHowever, moving R first might be slightly better because:\n- After (6,5), moving U to (6,6) leaves the option to then move L to (5,6), which is a new area (not recently traversed).\n- Moving U first to (5,6), then R to (6,6), then L to (5,6) is a bit of a zigzag that doesn't open new areas.\n\nBut both are essentially similar in outcome. \n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in choosing R or U?\n\n- Moving R to (6,5):\n  - Next to (6,4) which is body, but not colliding unless we move into it.\n  - No immediate collision.\n- Moving U to (5,6):\n  - No adjacent body parts or walls except (5,5) which is behind.\n  - Also safe.\n\n### Considering Future Moves After Eating\n\nAfter eating the food at (6,6), the snake's length increases by 1. The new tail will be where the old tail was at turn 48, which is (4,1). \n\nAt turn 48:\n- Tail: (4,1)\n- After move R at 48: head at (6,5), tail moves to (?,?) — need to see how body moves.\nActually, the tail moves forward based on the body's movement. The last segment is (4,1), second last is (5,1), so tail moves to (5,1) at turn 49.\n\nAt turn 49:\n- If we moved R at 48, then U at 49 to (6,6), the tail is at (5,1), which is far from head.\nNo danger.\n\nSimilarly for moving U first.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth moves R and U are safe and lead to eating the food. Since the snake is currently moving right, continuing right (R) maintains momentum and is a straightforward path to the food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 49  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 2)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (6, 5), followed by body segments:  \n[(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]  \nThat's a length of 12.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (right, which is increasing x, so from (6,5) it was moving to the right)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (6, 6), value = 2, life_span = 1\n2. (6, 2), value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,5) with direction R, the possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (6,6)\n- D (Down): (6,4)\n- L (Left): (5,5)\n- R (Right): (7,5)\n\nBut we cannot reverse direction instantly, so since the current direction is R, we cannot move L (left). So possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move U (Up) to (6,6)\n- Check if (6,6) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=6 is not 0 or 7.\n  - Not an internal obstacle: (5,2) is not (6,6).\n  - Not colliding with body:\n    - Snake body segments are all positions except head: (5,5), (4,5), ..., (5,1).\n    - (6,6) is not in the body segments.\n  - Food at (6,6): value=2, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n    - Eating it: reward +2, length increases by 1.\n    - Check Tail Reward Danger:\n      - Tail is at (5,1). Adjacent to head (6,5)? \n        - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n        - (6,5) and (5,1): x differs by 1, y differs by 4 → not adjacent.\n      - So no danger from tail food.\n    - So eating is safe and beneficial.\n- After move:\n  - New head: (6,6)\n  - New body: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), ..., (6,1)] (tail (5,1) is removed)\n  - Length becomes 13.\n  - Food at (6,6) is eaten and removed.\n  - Food at (6,2) is still there but life_span decreases by 1 to 0, so it disappears after this turn unless eaten.\n    - But we're moving to (6,6), not (6,2), so it disappears.\n\n#### 2. Move D (Down) to (6,4)\n- Check if (6,4) is valid:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an obstacle.\n  - Is it in body? \n    - Body segments: (5,5), (4,5), ..., (5,1).\n    - (6,4) is in the body (from the list: ..., (6,4), ...).\n    - So this is a body collision (unless it's the tail).\n    - Tail is at (5,1), so (6,4) is not the tail → collision → death.\n  - So this move is invalid (deadly).\n\n#### 3. Move R (Right) to (7,5)\n- Check if (7,5) is valid:\n  - x=7 is a border wall → collision → death.\n  - So this move is invalid.\n\n### Available Moves Summary\n- U (Up) to (6,6): safe, eats positive food (+2), length increases.\n- D (Down) to (6,4): deadly (body collision).\n- R (Right) to (7,5): deadly (wall collision).\n- L (Left) to (5,5): not allowed (reverse direction from R to L).\n\n### Other Considerations\n- Food at (6,2) has value=10, but life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n  - To eat it, we'd need to move to (6,2) this turn.\n  - Current head is at (6,5), so to reach (6,2) in one move is impossible (can only move one cell at a time).\n  - So cannot eat (6,2) this turn; it will disappear.\n- Only other food is at (6,6), which we can eat by moving U.\n\n### Decision\nThe only safe and beneficial move is U (Up) to (6,6), eating the positive food there (+2). All other moves lead to death or are not allowed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 50  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: (5, 2) is a wall cell we cannot move into.  \n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (6, 6), followed by body segments in this order:  \n(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)  \n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U).  \n**Food**:  \n- (6, 2): value = 9, life_span = 1 (this means it disappears after this turn if not eaten).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Head at (6,6), moving Up (U), so next position would be (6,7) if moving Up.\n- The food is at (6,2), which is part of the snake's body (specifically, the 10th segment from the head: (6,2)).\n  \nFrom the rules:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away from that cell, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nGiven that the food is at (6,2) which is part of the snake's body, and its life_span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Up (U). Possible moves (cannot instantly reverse, so cannot go Down (D)):  \n- Up (U): (6,6) → (6,7)\n- Left (L): (6,6) → (5,6)\n- Right (R): (6,6) → (7,6)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (6,7)**:\n   - (6,7): Check if it's a wall or body.\n     - Border walls: y=7 is a wall. So (6,7) is a wall → collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (5,6)**:\n   - (5,6): Check walls or body.\n     - Walls: (5,2) is a wall, but (5,6) is not listed as a wall.\n     - Body: Snake segments are from (6,5) to (5,1). (5,6) is not in the body.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - After moving left, the tail moves forward, so the segment at (5,1) is removed, and the new tail is (6,1).\n   - Does this allow eating the food at (6,2)?\n     - The head moves to (5,6), body segments shift: (6,2) is still occupied by the 9th segment (originally (6,3) moves to (6,2)).\n     - So (6,2) is still under the body after this move → cannot eat the food this turn.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (7,6)**:\n   - (7,6): Check walls or body.\n     - Border walls: x=7 is a wall → (7,6) is a wall → collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n### Evaluating Food at (6,2)\n\nThe food is at (6,2) with life_span=1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten now. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (6,2), and the head must move onto (6,2).\n- Currently, (6,2) is occupied by the snake's body (the segment that was at (6,3) moves to (6,2) when the head moves).\n- The only way to have the head at (6,2) is to move Down (D), but current direction is Up, and we cannot instantly reverse (from U to D is not allowed).\n  \nSo, it's impossible to eat the food at (6,2) this turn because:\n- Cannot move Down (reverse not allowed).\n- Moving Left or Right doesn't get the head to (6,2).\n- Moving Up is invalid (wall).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules:\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n  \nCurrent tail is at (5,1). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2)\n  \nHead is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to (5,1), so no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Available Moves Recap\n\nFrom above:\n- Up: wall → invalid\n- Left: valid, but can't eat food\n- Right: wall → invalid\n- Down: reverse → not allowed\n\nOnly valid move is Left (L), even though we can't eat the food this turn.\n\n### Is There Any Other Consideration?\n\nThe food at (6,2) is positive (value=9), but we can't eat it this turn, and it will disappear after this turn. So no benefit from it.\n\nNo other food is present in the state.\n\n### Decision\n\nOnly possible safe move is Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(4,6) is not in this list.\n   - Valid move.\n   - After moving, the new head is at (4,6), and the tail moves forward, so the segment at (6,1) is removed.\n   - Food at (6,2) is not eaten in this move.\n   - Food at (6,2) will disappear next turn (life span was 1, and this is the turn it's counted down).\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5,7)**:\n   - Check if (5,7) is valid:\n     - y=7 is a border wall. **Invalid move** (wall collision).\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5,5)**:\n   - Check if (5,5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Is it part of the snake's body?\n       - Current body segments: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), ... So (5,5) is the 4th segment.\n       - Moving to (5,5) would mean the head collides with the body segment there. **Invalid move** (body collision).\n\n### Considering the Food at (6,2)\n\nThe food is at (6,2), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (specifically, the 12th segment in the list, counting from 0: (6,2)).\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (5,6), and the food is at (6,2), which is several segments away. The only way to eat this food is to have the head move to (6,2), but that's not possible in one move from (5,6). \n\nMoreover, the tail is at (6,1), and the food is at (6,2). The tail will move forward (to (6,2)) if the snake moves in a direction that doesn't grow its length (i.e., doesn't eat food). \n\nBut the food is under the body at (6,2), so when the tail moves from (6,1) to (6,2), the food will be under the new tail position. \n\nHowever, the head cannot reach (6,2) in one move from (5,6), so eating this food is impossible this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (6,1).\n- Head is at (5,6). Distance is |5-6| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So no danger from this rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Left (L) to (4,6): Valid.\n- Up (U) to (5,7): Invalid (wall).\n- Down (D) to (5,5): Invalid (body collision).\n\nOnly valid move is Left (L). \n\nEven though there's positive food at (6,2), it's impossible to eat it this turn because the head cannot reach it in one move, and the food is under the body.

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 52 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, we can't move to these coordinates.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (5, 2).\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n   - **Positions (head first):** \n     [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]\n   - **Head Direction:** Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - **Food 1:** (6, 2), value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - **Food 2:** (6, 5), value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse:** Since the current direction is Left (L), we cannot move Right (R) in the next turn.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n**Current Head Position:** (4, 6)\n\n**1. Move Up (U): (x, y+1) → (4, 7)**\n   - Check if (4, 7) is valid:\n     - y=7 is a border wall → **Invalid (wall collision)**\n   \n**2. Move Down (D): (x, y-1) → (4, 5)**\n   - Check (4, 5):\n     - Is it part of the snake's body? Looking at the positions:\n       - (4, 5) is the 6th segment (index 5 in 0-based counting).\n       - Normally, moving into the tail is okay because the tail moves forward, but let's see:\n         - The tail is at (6, 2). The segment before tail is (6, 3), then (6, 4), etc.\n         - (4, 5) is not the immediate tail, but it's part of the body.\n         - **Collision with body → Invalid (body collision)**\n   \n   Wait, is this always true? Actually, the only body collision that's deadly is if the head moves into a body segment that isn't the tail (since the tail moves away). But if the head moves into the tail's current position, it's okay because the tail will have moved by then.\n   \n   Let me re-examine:\n   - The tail is at (6, 2). The segment before tail is (6, 3), etc.\n   - (4, 5) is indeed part of the body (positions 5 onwards: (5,5), (4,5), etc.).\n   - So moving to (4,5) would mean the head is where the body is, and that body part isn't the tail → **Invalid (body collision)**\n   \n   So Down is invalid.\n\n**3. Move Left (L): (x-1, y) → (3, 6)**\n   - Check (3, 6):\n     - Is it a wall? x=3 is not a border, and no internal obstacle at (3,6).\n     - Is it part of the snake's body? \n       - Snake positions: [(4,6), (5,6), ...], so (3,6) is not in the list.\n     - **Valid move.**\n   \n   Now, is there food at (3,6)? \n   - Food is at (6,2) and (6,5) → No.\n   - So no food to eat here, just moving safely.\n\n**Alternative Consideration: Is there a better move?**\n\nWait, the only valid move seems to be Left (L). Up and Down lead to collisions.\n\nBut let me think if I missed something with Down.\n\n**Re-evaluating Down (D): (4,5)**\n   - (4,5) is the 6th segment in the snake's body.\n   - The tail is at (6,2), and the segment before is (6,3), etc.\n   - The body segments are: head at (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n   - So (4,5) is the 6th segment, and the tail is the 13th segment (counting from 0).\n   - Moving into (4,5) would mean the head is overlapping with the body segment that isn't the tail → collision.\n   - Unless the tail is moving away at the same time, but the tail is at (6,2), which is far.\n   - So Down is indeed invalid.\n\nSimilarly, Up is invalid due to wall.\n\nLeft is the only valid move.\n\nBut is there any food to consider?\n\n**Food at (6,2):**\n   - Current head is at (4,6). To reach (6,2), it's far, and we can't in one move.\n   \n**Food at (6,5):**\n   - Current head at (4,6), food at (6,5).\n   - Distance: need to go right then down, but current direction is left, can't go right next.\n   - So can't reach in one move.\n\nThus, no food is reachable in the next move, so we just need to move safely.\n\n**Is Left (L) safe?**\n   - New head at (3,6).\n   - Next turn, direction is L, so can't go R.\n   - Possible moves then would be U, D, L.\n   - Let's see future possibilities briefly:\n     - If we go L again: (2,6). Is that safe?\n       - Not a wall, not in body (assuming no body there yet).\n     - So seems safe for now.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule says:\n- If head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (6,2).\n- Adjacent to tail: (5,2), (7,2), (6,1), (6,3).\n   - (5,2) is an internal obstacle.\n   - (7,2) is a wall (x=7).\n   - (6,1): y=1, not a wall, but not sure if it's part of body.\n   - (6,3): part of body (from positions: ..., (6,3), (6,2)).\n   \nHead is at (4,6), not adjacent to tail (distance is more than 1). So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Left (L).

No, food is at (6,2) and (6,5).\n  \nSo moving left to (2,6) seems safe, but it doesn't lead to any food immediately.\n\n### Checking Move Down (D) to (3,5)\n\n- Is (3,5) a wall? No.\n- Is (3,5) part of the snake's body? Yes, it's the 8th segment in the list.\n  \nBut here's the thing: when the head moves to (3,5), the tail is at (6,3) and will move forward, so the segment at (3,5) will no longer be there after the tail moves. So moving into the tail's current position is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nHowever, is there food at (3,5)? No, food is at (6,2) and (6,5).\n\nBut more importantly, if we move down to (3,5), the next segment is (4,5), which is part of the body. Wait, no: the head moves to (3,5), then the body segments shift:\n- New head: (3,5)\n- Next segments: (3,6), (4,6), etc.\n\nSo (3,5) is the new head, (3,6) is the next segment, which is the old head. So no immediate collision.\n\nBut is there any food at (3,5)? No. So moving down doesn't get us food but is safe.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nWe have two food items:\n1. (6,2): value=6, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn)\n2. (6,5): value=9, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn)\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nNow, can we reach any of these foods this turn?\n\nCurrent head is at (3,6). To reach:\n- (6,2): Need to move right 3 steps and down 4 steps. Can't do that in one move.\n- (6,5): Need to move right 3 steps and down 1 step. Also can't do in one move.\n\nSo we can't reach any food this turn directly. But we can plan to move towards them.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (6,3). Is there food at (6,3)? No, food is at (6,2) and (6,5). So this isn't a concern right now.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving left to (2,6) is safe but doesn't lead to food.\n- Moving down to (3,5) is safe but doesn't lead to food.\n- Moving up is into a wall.\n- Can't move right (opposite of current left direction).\n\nBoth left and down are safe, but which is better for future moves towards food?\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (6,2) is at the bottom-right.\n- (6,5) is above it.\n\nCurrently, the snake is on the top-left. To reach (6,2) or (6,5), moving down seems better because it brings the head closer to the lower part where food is.\n\nAfter moving down to (3,5), next turn we can consider moving right towards the food.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (2,6) keeps us at the top, which might not be optimal for reaching the food quickly.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving down?\n- New head position: (3,5)\n- Next segment: (3,6)\n- Then (4,6), etc.\nNo collision since the tail moves away from (3,5).\n\nSimilarly for moving left to (2,6):\n- New head: (2,6)\n- Next segment: (3,6)\nNo collision.\n\nBoth are safe, but moving down seems more strategic for reaching food.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween left and down, moving down seems better for future pathing towards food. Moving left would keep us at the top edge, which might not be helpful.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",
