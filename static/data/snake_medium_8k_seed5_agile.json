        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn \\( t_0 = 5 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at [(4, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 1), (2, 6)].\n  \n- **Snake Position**: The snake's body segments are at [(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4)], with the head at (2, 3) and the tail at (1, 4). The head is currently moving to the right (R).\n\n- **Food Available**:\n  - (4, 2): value = +1, life_span = 5 (will disappear after Turn 9)\n  - (6, 5): value = +1, life_span = 6 (will disappear after Turn 10)\n  - (2, 2): value = +1, life_span = 9 (will disappear after Turn 13)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (2, 3)\n\nGiven the head is moving right (R), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2, 4)\n   - Check: (2, 4) is not a wall or obstacle. Currently, the snake's body is at (1, 4), which is not adjacent to (2, 4), so no collision.\n   \n2. **Down (D)**: (2, 2)\n   - Check: (2, 2) is not a wall or obstacle and has positive food. However, we need to ensure that eating this food doesn't lead to a collision with the tail after growth.\n     - Current tail is at (1, 4). After eating, the new tail will be at (1, 3) (since the snake grows by adding a segment where the tail was).\n     - The head moving to (2, 2) is not adjacent to the new tail (1, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (1, 3)\n   - Check: This is the opposite of the current direction (R), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n   \n4. **Right (R)**: (3, 3)\n   - Check: (3, 3) is not a wall or obstacle and is free.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\n**Option 1: Move Down (D) to (2, 2)**\n- **Pros**: Immediately eats positive food at (2, 2), increasing the score and snake length.\n- **Cons**: The snake grows, which might limit future movement flexibility, but given the current length (3), it's manageable.\n- **Future Path**: After eating at (2, 2), the next moves can be planned to reach (4, 2) before it disappears.\n\n**Option 2: Move Right (R) to (3, 3)**\n- **Pros**: Keeps the snake's length the same, allowing more flexibility in future moves.\n- **Cons**: Delays eating food, risking missing out on (4, 2) if not planned carefully.\n\n**Option 3: Move Up (U) to (2, 4)**\n- **Pros**: Moves towards the center, potentially opening more options.\n- **Cons**: Doesn't directly target any food, and (4, 2) might become harder to reach in time.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that (2, 2) is positive food with a long life_span, eating it now secures a point and allows the snake to grow, which is beneficial early in the game. The immediate move to (2, 2) is safe and doesn't lead to any collisions. \n\nAfter eating at (2, 2), the next moves can be planned to reach (4, 2) before it disappears at Turn 9. Here's a potential sequence:\n\n1. **Turn 5**: Move D to (2, 2) - eat food.\n   - New snake: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4)]\n   \n2. **Turn 6**: From (2, 2), possible moves:\n   - U: (2, 3) - body segment, collision.\n   - D: (2, 1) - free.\n   - L: (1, 2) - wall.\n   - R: (3, 2) - free.\n   Best move is R to (3, 2) to head towards (4, 2).\n   \n3. **Turn 7**: From (3, 2), move R to (4, 2) - eat food.\n   - New snake: [(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)]\n\nThis sequence ensures we eat two positive foods ((2, 2) and (4, 2)) while avoiding collisions and walls.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action at Turn 5 is to move Down (D) to eat the food at (2, 2).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It cannot be eaten now because the head is not adjacent to it, and the body must move away first. Ignore for now.\n- (3,5) is the target. Moving U now sets up for L next turn to eat it.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving D to (4,3) is safe (tail moves away), but it doesn't help reach the food.\n- Moving L to (3,4) is safe but delays reaching (3,5) by one turn (would need to go U to (3,5) afterward).\n- Moving U to (4,5) is optimal for the plan.\n\n### Action:\nFollow the plan: move U to (4,5).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

All other moves are invalid due to collisions, walls, or reverse direction.\n\n### Next Steps (for context):\nAfter moving U to (6,6) on Turn 29:\n- New head position: (6,6)\n- New direction: U (up)\n- Snake positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] (tail at (4,3))\n- On Turn 30, the only valid move will be L (left) to (5,6) to eat the food there, as U and R lead to walls, and D is reverse.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 29:\n\\boxed{U}",

(5,6): value=2, life_span=1 (positive food, disappears after turn 30 if not eaten).\n2. (3,4): value=5, life_span=1 (positive food, disappears after turn 30 if not eaten).\n3. (4,5): value=8, life_span=1 (positive food, disappears after turn 30 if not eaten).\n\n**Observations:**\n- The food at (4,5) is under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at (4,5) is part of the snake's body). To eat it, the body must move away first.\n- The food at (5,6) is adjacent to the head (6,6) and can be eaten by moving left (L).\n- The food at (3,4) is not directly accessible in one move.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (6,6), Direction U\n\nFrom the head at (6,6), moving up (U) is not possible because y=7 is a wall. The current direction is U, so we cannot move down (D) as it's the opposite direction. Thus, the possible moves are:\n- Left (L): to (5,6).\n- Right (R): to (7,6) — but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n\n**Valid Move:**\n- L to (5,6).\n\n### Evaluating Move L to (5,6)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Eats the food at (5,6), which has a value of 2 (increases score by 2 and length by 1).\n- The food disappears after this turn, so it's now or never.\n\n**Cons:**\n- After eating, the snake grows, and the tail does not move. The new positions would be:\n  - Head: (5,6)\n  - Body: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] (now length 11).\n- Next turn, from (5,6), direction L (since we moved left):\n  - Possible moves:\n    - U to (5,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n    - D to (5,5) — occupied by body (segment at (5,5)), collision.\n    - L to (4,6) — internal obstacle (wall), invalid.\n    - R to (6,6) — occupied by body (segment at (6,6)), and opposite direction, invalid.\n  - No valid moves, leading to death on the next turn.\n\n### Alternative: Avoid Eating Food at (5,6)\n\nIf we choose not to eat the food at (5,6), we must find another move. However, the only other possible move is R to (7,6), which is invalid (wall). Thus, we are forced to move L to (5,6).\n\n### Considering Food Under Body (4,5)\n\nThe food at (4,5) is under the snake's body. To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (4,5).\n2. The head must then move to (4,5).\n\nHowever, in the current state, the body segment at (4,5) is not the tail, so it won't move away unless the snake's movement causes it to shift. Given the current constraints, it's impossible to free (4,5) in one move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only possible move at turn 30 is to go left (L) to (5,6) and eat the food there, even though it leads to an unavoidable death on the next turn. This is because all other moves are invalid (walls or body collisions), and the food at (5,6) will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",
