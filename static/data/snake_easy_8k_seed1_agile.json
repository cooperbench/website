This cannot be eaten immediately because the head is already on it (must move away and return).\n\n### Previous Plan (from Turn 6):\nThe plan was:\n- Turn 6: U (to (3,6)) — but the snake is now at (4,5), so this didn't happen. The snake moved R to (4,5) instead.\n- Turn 7: R (to (5,5)) — but the current state shows the snake at (4,5), so the previous plan is no longer valid.\n\n### Immediate Options (Turn 7):\nFrom (4,5), direction R, possible moves:\n1. **R (to (5,5))**: \n   - (5,5) is free (no wall or body).\n   - Moves towards (5,4) food.\n2. **U (to (4,6))**: \n   - (4,6) is free.\n   - Moves towards (6,6) food.\n3. **D (to (4,4))**: \n   - (4,4) is free.\n   - Moves towards (2,1) food.\n\nCannot move L (opposite direction to R).\n\n### Food Priorities:\n1. **(6,6)**: Disappears after Turn 10 (3 turns left). High priority due to short life.\n2. **(5,4)**: Disappears after Turn 14 (7 turns left). Can be eaten later.\n3. **(2,1)**: Disappears after Turn 11 (4 turns left).

Thus, allowed moves are:\n1. **D (Down)**: (4,3)\n2. **L (Left)**: (3,4)\n3. **R (Right)**: (5,4)\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move R to (5,4)**:\n   - (5,4) has positive food (+1, length +1).\n   - New head at (5,4), body segments shift: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), and tail stays at (3,6) (snake grows to length 5).\n   - **Risk**: After this move, the snake's head is at (5,4), and the next possible moves (U/D/R) are limited:\n     - U to (5,5): Safe.\n     - D to (5,3): Safe.\n     - R to (6,4): Blocked by wall.\n     - L: Opposite of current direction (R), so disallowed.\n   - **Issue**: The snake is now near the wall (6,4), limiting future movement options.

If not eaten now (Turn 13), it will only be available for one more turn (Turn 14).\n2. **Direction Constraints**: Current direction is L, so the snake cannot move right (R) on the next turn (instant reverse).\n3. **Safe Moves**: From (3,4), possible moves are:\n   - **L (left) to (2,4)**: Safe, no food.\n   - **U (up) to (3,5)**: Occupied by the tail (safe to move here as the tail will move away).\n   - **D (down) to (3,3)**: Safe, no food.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Eat (5,4) Now**: To maximize score, the snake should prioritize eating the food at (5,4) before it disappears. However, moving right (R) is not allowed (instant reverse from current direction L). Thus, the snake must first change direction to enable a right move later.\n- **Alternative Path**: Move down (D) to (3,3) on Turn 13, then right (R) to (4,3) on Turn 14, and then right (R) again to (5,3) on Turn 15 to approach (5,4). However, this is too slow—(5,4) will disappear after Turn 14.\n- **Best Immediate Action**: Move up (U) to (3,5) (tail position) on Turn 13 to free up the left direction, then move right (R) to (4,5) on Turn 14 to align for eating (5,4) on Turn 15. However, this is also too slow.\n\nGiven the constraints, the snake cannot reach (5,4) in time without risking collision or violating movement rules. Thus, the safest immediate action is to move down (D) to (3,3) to avoid risks and plan for the longer-lived food at (3,1).\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{D} (Move down to (3,3))",

No, the tail is at (4, 4), and no food is listed there.  \n   - Safe move, but no food at (4, 4).  \n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4, 2)**:  \n   - New head position: (4, 2).  \n   - Check collisions:  \n     - Walls: y=2 is within bounds.  \n     - Body: (4, 2) is not in the body segments.  \n   - Food: No food at (4, 2).  \n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.  \n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\n**Food Priorities**:  \n- (3, 1): Must be eaten by turn 20 (5 turns left).  \n- (3, 5): Must be eaten by turn 22 (7 turns left).  \n\n**Path to (3, 1)**:  \n- Current head at (4, 3).  \n- To reach (3, 1):  \n  - Move left to (3, 3) (but opposite move is not allowed, current direction is R).  \n  - Alternative: Move down to (4, 2), then left to (3, 2), then down to (3, 1).  \n    - This takes 3 turns, so can be done by turn 18.  \n\n**Path to (3, 5)**:  \n- Current head at (4, 3).  \n- To reach (3, 5):  \n  - Move up to (4, 4), then left to (3, 4), then up to (3, 5).  \n    - This takes 3 turns, so can be done by turn 18.  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n- Moving right (R) to (5, 3) doesn't directly help in reaching either food quickly.  \n- Moving up (U) to (4, 4) is safe and starts the path towards (3, 5).  \n- Moving down (D) to (4, 2) is safe and starts the path towards (3, 1).  \n\nGiven that (3, 1) has a shorter life span and must be eaten sooner, prioritizing the path to (3, 1) is better.  \n\n### Action Sequence for Turns 15-19\n\n1. **Turn 15: D to (4, 2)**  \n   - Starts the path towards (3, 1).  \n\n2. **Turn 16: L to (3, 2)**  \n   - From (4, 2), move left to (3, 2).  \n\n3. **Turn 17: D to (3, 1)**  \n   - Eat the food at (3, 1).  \n\n4. **Turn 18: L to (2, 1)**  \n   - From (3, 1), move left to (2, 1) to avoid getting stuck.  \n\n5. **Turn 19: U to (2, 2)**  \n   - Start moving up to free space.  \n\n### Final Decision for Turn 15\n\nThe immediate action is to move down (D) to (4, 2) to start the path towards eating (3, 1).  \n\n\\boxed{D}  \n\n### Action Sequence (for reference)\n- Turn 15: D  \n- Turn 16: L  \n- Turn 17: D  \n- Turn 18: L  \n- Turn 19: U  \n\nThis sequence ensures that the time-sensitive food at (3, 1) is eaten by turn 17, and then the snake can navigate towards the other food at (3, 5) if possible.",

Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,4) (Head Direction U):\n- **U (Up)**: (4,5) - Valid, no wall or body collision.\n- **L (Left)**: (3,4) - Valid, no wall or body collision.\n- **R (Right)**: (5,4) - Valid, no wall or body collision.\n- **D (Down)**: Invalid (opposite of current direction U).\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move U to (4,5)**:\n   - Next turn (Turn 21), can move L to (3,5) to eat (3,5).\n   - Then on Turn 22, can move U to (3,6) to eat (3,6).\n   - This sequence efficiently captures two food items quickly.\n\n2. **Move L to (3,4)**:\n   - Next turn (Turn 21), can move U to (3,5) to eat (3,5).\n   - Then on Turn 22, can move U to (3,6) to eat (3,6).\n   - Similar to the first option but starts with a left move.\n\n3. **Move R to (5,4)**:\n   - Moves away from the nearest food (3,5) and (3,6).\n   - Less optimal for capturing food quickly.\n\n### Immediate Priority:\n- (3,1) cannot be eaten this turn (distance too far).\n- Focus on (3,5) and (3,6) which have shorter life spans.\n- Moving U or L sets up a path to eat both (3,5) and (3,6) in the next two turns.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger:\n- Currently, the tail is at (3,2), and no food is adjacent to the head at (4,4).\n- No immediate danger from tail reward collision.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth U and L moves are valid and set up a path to eat the most urgent food.

Snake moves, tail is removed.\n   - New positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)].\n   - Opens space for future movement.

Moving U to (3,6) risks trapping the snake with limited escape routes.\n- **Future opportunities**: Food at (1,4) and (6,2) have longer life spans, so they can be targeted later.\n- **Best immediate action**: Move **L (Left) to (2,5)** to open up space and avoid unnecessary risks.

Safe.\n2. **Down (D)**: To (4,4).\n   - (4,4) is not occupied by the snake or walls. Safe.\n3. **Up (U)**: To (4,6).\n   - (4,6) is occupied by a body segment (not the tail). Moving here would cause a collision. Invalid.\n4. **Right (R)**: To (5,5).\n   - (5,5) is occupied by a body segment (not the tail). Also, R is the reverse of the current direction L, which is not allowed. Invalid.\n\nThus, the valid moves are **L to (3,5)** or **D to (4,4)**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move L to (3,5)**:\n   - New head position: (3,5).\n   - Body shifts: Tail moves to (3,6), vacating (2,6).\n   - Next possible moves from (3,5): U (to (3,6), D (to (3,4)), L (to (2,5)). \n   - (3,6) is the tail position (safe), but no food there. \n   - Moving towards (2,3) (food) would require moving down or left further.\n\n2. **Move D to (4,4)**:\n   - New head position: (4,4).\n   - Body shifts: Tail moves to (3,6), vacating (2,6).\n   - Next possible moves from (4,4): D (to (4,3)), L (to (3,4)), R (to (5,4)).\n   - Moving towards (2,3) (food) would require moving left or down further.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- **(6,2)**: Cannot be reached in time (disappears after Turn 32; Manhattan distance from (4,5) is 5 > 2 turns left). Ignore.\n- **(2,3)**: Can be targeted. From (4,5), moving L to (3,5) is a step towards it.\n- **(1,1)**: Far away; can be targeted later.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- Moving L to (3,5) avoids immediate collisions and starts moving towards (2,3).\n- Moving D to (4,4) is safe but doesn't directly progress towards food.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (3,5) to start navigating towards the food at (2,3) while avoiding collisions.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(2,3) is closer and time-sensitive (must be eaten by Turn 38).\n\n### Path to (2,3):\nFrom (3,4), the food at (2,3) is diagonally adjacent (left and down).

The new tail will be at (5,6), which is far from the head, so no immediate collision risk.\n- From (2,3), the snake can safely move R to (3,3) or D to (2,2) to avoid trapping itself.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action at Turn 33 is to move **L (Left)** to (2,4), setting up to eat (2,3) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Life span is short (until turn 40).\n- **(6,3)**: Farther (distance = 4), but longer life span (until turn 43). Requires moving right and down.\n\n### Immediate Action:\n- **Move Left (L) to (1,3)**:\n  - Starts the path toward (1,1), which is closer and has a shorter life span.\n  - Avoids immediate collision and aligns with the guidance to prioritize (1,1).\n\n### Why Not Right or Down?\n- **Right (R)**: Moves toward (6,3), but the path is longer and may risk trapping the snake.\n- **Down (D)**: Moves away from both foods, delaying the opportunity to eat.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to move left (L) to start the path toward (1,1), which is the closer and more time-sensitive food.\n\n\\boxed{L}",
